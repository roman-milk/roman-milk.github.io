Hello, Dear Readers, This is another story written under the name Ezra Zane for Ruthie's Club and published by it last year. It was edited by that wonderful lady, Ruthie. I do hope you enjoy it. E.Z. 

Part One 

I'm Andrew Jackson Williams V. My friends call me Jack. I'm a twenty-nine- years-old, six one, and two hundred pound health nut who exercises compulsively and doesn't smoke or drink except for wine and an occasional beer when it's really hot. Good looking some people say, some say handsome as hell. 

I like working for myself and I like being outdoors. I started mowing lawns when I was thirteen. I had three crews when I was fourteen and five at sixteen. That grew into a multi-crew landscaping company and a nursery. About three years ago, my Granddad left me a small inheritance. I made Jorge Castillo manager of the landscaping company, Nat Bolton manager of the nursery, and gave both a healthy performance bonus. I used the inheritance to start a dirt-work construction company. It's growing nicely. Now I'm building a cash reserve for my next investment, whatever that may be. 

I drove to a subdivision one day to bid my part of a job for a plumbing contractor. The homes were about forty years old, frame construction on a slab foundation. Their water line had broken in the back yard. I'd tear out the old and trench for the new. Arthur's company would lay the line and connect it. 

I rang the front door bell and a woman answered. She was about five two, black hair down to her shoulders, round face, and big green eyes. Her eyes got bigger as she stared up at me. 

I gave her my sexiest boyish grin and said, "Hi. I'm Jack Williams. I'm going to do the dirt work for Arthur's Plumbing. I'll be going into your back yard to evaluate the site." 

"Hi," she said dreamily. 

"You are Mrs. Saunders, aren't you?" I asked. 

Blinking rapidly, she looked startled. "Yes, I'm Mary Saunders. Go ahead and do your thing," she said. She was still at the front door watching me as I walked around back. The front of the house was neat, but the backyard was a mess. It looked like no one had cleaned or mowed it in six months. As I walked her back yard, I had the feeling I was being watched. I looked up to see her peering out the back window at me. When I started to leave, she came out the back door. 

"Mr. Williams?" she called. I turned and waited for her. "Are you leaving?" she asked. 

"I just came out to make an evaluation." 

"But when will we have water?" 

"Two days. Tomorrow afternoon at the earliest." 

"Two days? Oh, no. I can't stand it!" 

"Sorry, Mrs. Saunders. Grab the hubby and the kids and go to a motel." 

"I've been divorced for a year and I can't afford a motel," she said dejectedly. She looked like she was going to cry. 

I have business principles. The first one is to hire good people, train them, and treat them well. The second is to do the best damn job possible and for a reasonable price. The third is to be polite no matter how nasty the customer is. The fourth is to get the cash before you fuck the lady of the house. Sometimes they think their bodies are payment. 

She looked up at me with wet, but focused, eyes, which made me guess the crying was a ploy to get closer to me. I put my arms around her. She didn't put her arms around me, but she didn't pull away either. "It's all right," I whispered as I rubbed her back. 

I noticed several things as I held her. She was small boned, slim, and her breasts felt good against my chest. Her hair was raven with two or three strands of gray, which meant she didn't color it. She smelled good, with only a touch of perfume. She fit perfectly in all my nooks and crannies, which not all women do. I knew I was holding on to some good stuff. 

When I let go, she didn't move away. She leaned back to look up at me and said, "I didn't mean to impose on you, but it's been a long, hard week, and it's only Wednesday." 

"No problem," I replied. 

"I ruined your shirt. If you'll take it off, I'll wash it for you." 

"It's a work shirt. It'll be drenched in sweat in no time." 

"Well, thanks for comforting me, and please call me Mary." 

"My pleasure, Mary. I'm Jack." 

"I remember," she replied. 

"Let's see what we can do." 

I eased my cell phone out of my pocket and put my arm around her again. This time, she put her arms around my waist and her head on my chest. I called one of my crews to tell them to come dig. It'd cost me overtime but it was worth it. I called Arthur and told him I'd have it trenched and ready in four hours. He complained, but said he'd do it. 

"What's going to happen?" she asked when I disconnected. 

"You'll have water by midnight," I said. 

"Thanks," she said, but that one word carried a lot of meaning. 

I had another site to evaluate. "I'll be back in about an hour," I told her. "If my crew arrives before me, let them do their thing." She watched me get in my truck and drive away. 

When I got back to her place, my crew was unloading the equipment. We'd been working about an hour when Mary came out of the house wearing shorts and a white tee shirt tucked military style to fit like a glove. It hugged the rounds of her breasts and her braless nipples dimpled the cotton. The shorts revealed a tight ass and shapely legs. 

"How's it going, Jack?" she asked. 

"We're doing fine out here, Mary." 

She nodded. "If you want anything, knock on the back door. I'm going to put the kids to bed." 

The way she said "anything" and swayed back to the house told me if the anything I wanted was her, all I had to do was ask. 

Arthur arrived ahead of schedule. By eleven, she had running water, Arthur had his check, and the crews had departed. I intentionally dallied so I'd be the last one to leave. I was at my truck when she came out to talk to me again. 

"How can I ever thank you," she said. 

"You've thanked me," I said. I stripped off my sweat soaked shirt, got a clean one out of the pickup cab, and put it on as her eyes flitted over me, absorbing my muscles honed in the gym and workplace. 

"Would you like a beer?" her mouth asked. "Would you like me?" her face asked. 

"That'd be nice," I replied. 

We sat in her living room and talked. She married a guy she met in college, Jim, had a son, Jimmy, aged two, was twenty-six, and managed a retail card and gift shop. Another woman, Becky, and her child, a nine-year-old named Veronica, lived with Mary for companionship as well as financial need. A third woman, whose name was Monica, and her four-year-old daughter, Tiffany, lived in an apartment a short distance away. The three women, best friends since childhood, were an extended family. 

Mary was a gentle woman with a sexy softness I liked, but I guessed there was steel in her backbone. As we talked, she moved closer to me on the couch. "That's enough about me. Tell me about yourself, Jack. Are you married?" she asked innocently, but her body stiffened involuntarily as she waited for an answer. 

"I'm not the marrying kind, Mary. I like playing the field and women frown on that." 

"You never wanted to have children?" she asked. 

"I love children. There were five of us when Mom died. Dad remarried Mom's sister, my Aunt Sandy, and they moved in with us. She was divorced with three kids. They had two more, so there were ten kids in the house. If I ever get married, it'll be to have a big family. But I'll need an understanding wife." 

"Never even come close?" she asked. 

"I was engaged once. She broke it off because I slept with her sister." 

"That wasn't especially understanding of her," Mary said with a soft, teasing expression. "I'd like a big family, too. I was an only child and I always wanted brothers and sisters. I'm glad I didn't have them with Jim since that marriage didn't work out, but I still want them." 

"You're young. You'll find someone." 

She sighed despondently. "I'm an average looking divorcee with a small child and no money. The guys who ask me out are looking for sex and nothing more." 

"You're not average. You're one cool lady." 

She beamed. "If that means what I think it does, thanks." 

"But even if a guy wants only sex, that doesn't mean it's a bad deal," I said. 

"I might accept an offer if I thought I was going to be more than a one night stand." I'll bet her skin tingled because her every nerve was on alert for my response. 

I took a long time to answer. "Relationships are strange. I'll meet a woman I find interesting and she'll do one of two things. She'll lie to me or she' ll try to change me. That's when I break it off." 

"Oh, then it could last a while?" 

"It's up to her. It could last a long time if she lights my fire like you do." Our eyes were passing messages like a high-speed connection. "Do you ever meet any men who light your fire?" 

She couldn't answer my question. The words wouldn't come out. 

"Tough question?" I asked. She shook her head no. 

"Do you want me to kiss you?" Again, the words wouldn't come, but her expression spoke volumes and she gave one little nod. 

She'd been sitting with one leg tucked under. When I slid next to her, she shifted, slipping down on the couch with her legs out and slightly parted, and her head resting against the back. Her arms went limp by her sides. Her eyes fluttered closed when I kissed her. Her kiss was needy and hot and sweet. When I caressed her breasts through her tee shirt, she made little sounds almost like a cat's purr. It was what she wanted and she was braless to make it easy. I slid my hand under her tee shirt. Her nipples were hard and sensitive. As I rolled one in my fingers, her hips began to move. 

"Stop," she whispered. 

"Why?" 

"I don't mean stop for good, but my housemate Becky may not be asleep." 

"When's the last time you had sex in a truck?" 

"Too long." Her grin was replaced by a troubled look. "I hate to ask, but are you clean?" 

"Disease free. How about you?" 

"The same," she said. 

"Birth control?" 

"I put my diaphragm in tonight for the first time in a year. Please use a condom anyway." I made a face. "I don't like it either. I want to feel your cum scalding me, but I can't afford to get pregnant." 

"Condom it is." I extended my hand. She took a deep breath, exhaled loudly, and put her hand in mine. 

We ran like teenagers to my truck, a Ford F-250 diesel with a crew cab, parked in her driveway under some overhanging trees and opposite the kitchen window. I opened the door to the rear seat and gave her a hand up. She scooted across the seat to watch me with bright eyes as I sat beside her. 

She started unbuttoning my shirt and I helped her along. When it was gone, she slipped her tee shirt over her head. In a flash of modesty, she covered her breasts with her hands, and emitted a nervous giggle. "I haven't done this in a while," she said. She exhaled sharply and her hands fluttered to her lap. 

I reached for her breasts and she raised them to make it easier for me. "Nice," I said appreciatively. "Very nice." Her eyes closed and her sensual expression told me she liked having her nipples tugged. 

Her eyes opened and she shivered as she undid her shorts and wiggled out of them and her panties. "I want to put the condom on you," she whispered. I leaned over the front seat, got the condom from the glove box, and handed it to her before I stripped off my jeans and jockeys. My cock twitched in the air. 

"Oh, my God, he's beautiful," she said reverently. She wrapped her fingers around my shaft and dove for it like a bird attacking a worm, sucking the head into her mouth. She smiled up at me and sucked until she got what she wanted, a string of precum she licked from her lips. "He tastes good, too." She rolled the rubber over my cock and wrapped her fingers around it. "Fuck me, Jack. Fuck me long and hard," she said. 

I lay her back with one of her legs over my shoulder and the other on the seat back. "Hurry. I need it," she demanded. I was over her with one foot against the side door as her eager hands guided me to her love hole. "Oh, God," she gasped as I eased into her the first time. Her pussy was wet and tight and sweat broke out on her forehead. "You feel so good, Jack. So good in me," she moaned in my ear. 

Quickly, we were in a good rhythm with me bracing myself and her arms around my neck. Mary was a great fuck, squirming and thrusting her pussy as I plunged in and out. I was on top, facing her kitchen window. I raised my head to see a woman with light brown hair and brown eyes eating an apple and watching us. When our eyes met, she winked. 

"Oh, shit," I said and pulled out. 

"No, Jack. Don't stop." 

"There's a woman watching us." 

Mary didn't look. She waved a hand to motion the woman away. "It's Becky. Put him back in me. Hurry, Jack." 

I'd never been watched as I fucked someone, but I discovered it was a turn-on for me. Mary dug her nails into my back as she thrust against me. Her "uhs" became "ee, ee, ee," a series of little squeaks until she groaned and drove herself against me one final time as she came. I was close and stepped up the rhythm. Her ass started thrusting and she came again when I did, squeaking all the time. We squirmed until her back was against the seat and we were pressed together. 

"Ummm," she murmured contentedly. "I knew just by looking at you that you could fuck, but I never thought you could fuck that good." She sighed and kissed me again. "And you kiss just as good as you fuck." 

"You're dynamite. We need to do this again." 

"We will, anytime you want," she said emphatically. 

Later, at her front door, she asked, "Please come to dinner tomorrow night." 

"That sounds great. What time?" 

"Seven thirty." 

***** 

Thursday night, I was on time, clean, properly dressed in a starched blue dress shirt, Dockers, and boots, and brought a bottle of red wine. A woman about five five with short blonde hair, classic features, knockout body, bedroom eyes in a hue of blue, and a smirk opened the door. 

"Hi. You must be the incredible and wonderful Jack Williams who's God's gift to women," she said sassily. "I'm Monica Collins. Come in, o mighty one." She curtsied as she stood aside to let me slip past her. 

The place was small but spotless. Mary came out of the kitchen wearing a tight, short dress with a deep-cut bodice that displayed her breasts and the gold locket and chain nestled between them. She was beaming and her energy bubbled like a hot spring as she welcomed me with a kiss on the lips. She took the wine and guided me toward the couch. The hall door burst open and two little girls, escorted by the woman who'd watched us last night, bolted into the room. 

"Hi, Jack Williams," the woman said in a sexy tone full of promise. "I'm Becky. This is my daughter, Veronica. That little cutie is Tiffany, Monica's pride and joy. Have a seat." 

When I sat down, Tiffany started to crawl in my lap. "Come here, honey," Monica said as she reached for her. 

"That's all right," I interrupted. I picked up Tiffany and sat her on my lap. She smiled up at me with pretty blue eyes and wiggled against me to settle in. 

"Wine?" Monica asked, handing me a glass. 

"Please. Where's Jimmy?" I asked. 

"Already asleep, but I suspect he'll be up before you leave," Monica replied. 

I sat on the couch surrounded by women as we sipped wine and chatted. Surrounded was the key word here. Mary was to my left with her hand stroking my leg. Monica sat in a chair opposite. Nine year-old Veronica was on my right and four-year-old Tiffany was in my lap. Becky wandered in and out as she finished preparing dinner. 

When Becky called, "Dinner's ready," Veronica held my hand and guided me to the head of a table larded with the old favorites - roast, potatoes and vegetables, and homemade cherry pie for dessert, all cooked to perfection. I offered to help clean up, but Veronica escorted me to the couch. This time, Becky joined us. 

Within five minutes of meeting Becky and Monica, I wished I'd met them separately because I wanted to fuck them, too. Each of the three was damn good looking in her own way, and each had a different but positive personality. Mary was pretty, with a nice figure. She was sweet, solid, and sincere. I already knew she loved to fuck. Becky was an earth mother. Big boned and full breasted, she had a sexy twinkle in her eye, like she knew the secret of life and sex, and would share it for a song. Monica was the best looking of the three and had the most classic figure. Her quick wit and personality had a sharper edge, but there was something about her that begged for a man to bring her to heel while defying him to do it. 

The most surprising thing was that Becky and Monica both flirted with me. Monica gave me plenty of opportunities to look up her dress as we talked. When she saw caught me once or twice, she smiled and opened wider. I'm a guy, so I looked closer. 

When Monica announced it was Tiffany's bedtime, the child gave me a big hug. Her mother kissed me full on the lips. "Good night, Jack," Monica said. "I'm looking forward to seeing you again." 

"It's my bedtime, too," young Veronica said. "Good night, Mr. Williams. I've enjoyed meeting you." She kissed me on the cheek, kissed her mother and Mary, and tottered off to bed. 

"You survived the kids," Becky said. She had a sexy smile and her eyes held promises. 

"I enjoyed them." 

"I could tell you did. Mary tells me you want a big family." 

"That's right." 

"But she said you might never marry. How are you going to work that out?" she asked. 

That took me aback. "No marriage, no children, I guess." 

"That's too bad. You'd make a great father." She leaned into me with her breasts soft and warm on my chest, and her arms around my waist. She kissed me on the lips. It was a loving, warm kiss, but not a lover's hot kiss. She squeezed my hand and gave me a knowing smile. "Good night, Jack. I hope to see more of you." 

As Becky left to go to bed, I was confused and my expression showed it. 

"Is everything all right?" Mary asked. 

"Eh, yes. Why?" 

"Did we blow it? Did we overwhelm you? I mean, was this just too much? I told you they're my family, like sisters to me, but closer, and. . . ." 

"Whoa. Slow down. It's been a lovely evening and I've enjoyed myself. I like you and them." 

"A lot?" she interrupted. 

"Yes. A whole lot. And you're a great cook. I haven't had a roast like that since my grandmother died." 

She blushed. "Thanks, but Becky cooked the dinner and Monica baked the pie. I only set the table." 

"It was a beautiful table. The evening was lovely." I sat on the couch and she sat beside me, her legs splayed, knees locked, and her thigh against mine. 

"So you really liked them?" she asked. 

"Yes, Mary. I did." 

"Good," she said with a satisfied smile. Her face morphed to a devilish grin. "I did something very naughty today," she said, like a child sharing a secret. 

"What?" 

"When I got dressed for tonight, I didn't put on my panties." 

"You didn't?" I asked with mock surprise. "I don't believe you." 

"Check for yourself," she said. She raised her skirt. 

"How about Becky?" I asked. 

"What do you mean?" she asked. 

"Last night, you didn't want to have sex in the house because of her." 

"Don't worry," she said. When I hesitated, she lifted her skirt a little higher. "Well?" she challenged. 

I pulled her on her back, slipped my hand up her leg to find a bare and bloated pussy, and drove a finger into her wetness. "Oh, Jack, don't stop." I love watching a woman when she comes and Mary loved to cum, so I watched as she humped my hand and emitted her little squeaks until she did.  

===

I kissed her and pulled her to a sitting position to unzip her dress, which she helped me remove. She lay back on the couch wearing only a garter belt and stockings. It was the first time I'd seen her body in the light. She had a small pooch of a stomach, a trimmed bush, and a shape that made a man want to mount her. 

The surprise was a tattoo the size of a quarter half-way between her belly button and pubic bone. It was an inverted blue triangle with a red block letter "J" in the center. 

"I went to the doctor today. He started me on the pill and fitted me for a new diaphragm. We can do it bareback," she said. 

"Why don't we then?" 

"I thought you'd never ask," she said as she grinned and wiggled all over. 

"How about the floor?" I asked. 

She rolled off the couch and knelt, watching me with big, sexy eyes as I discarded my clothes. When I knelt, she grabbed my cock, jammed it in her mouth, and sucked like crazy. She popped him out, licked her lips, and smiled at me. 

"I like you fucking me, Jack Williams," she said softly. 

"That's good, Mary Saunders, because I like doing it." 

I had the feeling we were being watched. I looked up to see the hall door open an inch or so and a brown eye peering at me. 

"Becky's watching us again," I whispered. 

Mary didn't even look around. "I don't care. Do you?" she said. 

"No. Should I invite her to join us?" 

She chuckled. "No, but let her watch. Now shut up and fuck me." I pulled her into my lap and she squealed as she guided me into her. "Oh, Jesus, you fill me up so good," she moaned. 

Becky opened the door wide and leaned against the frame. Her being there didn't bother Mary and it certainly didn't bother me. I saw the joy in Mary' s face as we fucked, and the agony of pleasure when she came. I heard the delightful little mouse squeaks, the "ee, ee, ees" I was growing to love. Her sweat, smell, and rhythms were arousing and enjoyable. 

"That's it, Jack. Fill me with cum," Mary whispered when I shot. Becky winked at me and quietly closed the door behind her. 

**** 

All day Friday, Mary, Monica, and Becky played in and out of my mind as I tried to figure out what was happening with them. You can guess what my mind conjured up as what might happen. I knew one thing for sure. Mary was submissive. I was determined to explore that Friday night. 

I was at Mary's house when she got home from work. She wanted to change, but I had her come with me as she was. Becky, Veronica, and Jimmy waved good-bye as we drove away. Dinner was at a seafood place and we both ordered light. I took her to my townhouse, gave her a glass of wine, and we sat on the couch talking for an hour or so. I enjoyed talking to her, but it was time to move on. 

"Mary, undress for me," I said. She blushed lightly. 

"Oh? Undress for me? Just like that?" 

"Just like that." 

"Yes, Mr. Williams," she said impudently. 

She didn't undress. She performed a strip tease. Our eye games were the essential part of her performance. When she slipped her panties down her legs and set them aside, I said, "Come undress me." Her hands hurried and she forced herself to slow down. When I was down to my jockeys, she stuck her thumbs in the elastic and raised her head to be kissed. I kissed her hard and hot. 

She tugged them down my legs, but I didn't step out of them. When I sat down on the edge of the couch with them around my feet, I knew the next few minutes were of prime importance. A knowing look spread over her face. She quivered, knelt, gently lifted my feet, and removed my jockeys. She pushed my legs apart and knee-walked between them. She spread her knees, not widely but enough to make her point. Without looking away, she found my cock and sucked its head into her mouth. She put her hands behind her back. 

She sucked my cockhead like a baby on its mother's nipple. She knew what I wanted when I put my hand on the back of her head. She took my cock in her mouth as far as it would go. Her eyes were watery from her gag reflex when she looked at me. Saliva escaped the corner of her mouth, but she didn't try to retrieve it. I waited to see what she'd do. 

She let my cock slip out, took a deep breath, and pushed, swallowing it until her lips were buried in my pubic hair. I felt her throat muscles tighten around it. She let it ease out of her throat. She watched me and suckled. She was happy to be there. 

I knew this woman loved to suck cock and to fuck, and it was clear she was submissive, if only as a sexual game. Now I wanted to see if she would take my cock out of her mouth to answer my questions. 

"I like you, Mary. I like your smile, your sense of humor, and your honest heart. I like talking to you. I like fucking you. I like you between my legs sucking my cock with a complaint and obedient expression on your face," I said quietly. "You like it, too." 

She beamed and nodded. 

"You like being submissive, don't you?" 

The hard shaft between her rounded lips elongated her face. Her eyes held an aroused glittered with a touch of shyness. She nodded. 

"For any man?" 

She frowned and shook her head. 

"Just for me?" 

She smiled and nodded. 

"Do you like being bound?" 

She nodded. 

"Being spanked?" 

She nodded and shook. 

"Does that mean sometimes?" 

She nodded. 

"Are you going to put any limits on what I can do to you?" 

She wanted to speak, but that would change the game she was playing. Her eyes went from soft to hard and back again. She shrugged. I knew how she felt. I didn't know exactly where I was going with her. 

"I can tell you love to suck cock. Do you like the taste of cum?" 

She nodded and smiled around my cock. 

"Would you like me to cum in your mouth?" 

She nodded again. 

"You can use your hands." 

Damn, she was good. She used tongue and lips to bring me along slowly. Her eyes watched mine and her hands were on me to measure my tenseness. When I was ready, one hand pumped my cock's shaft and the other pulled my balls. 

"Oh, shit," I said. I held her head and humped away. She knew how to handle that, too, blocking my thrusts so I wouldn't go too deeply in her mouth, and she swallowed every drop when I came. I flopped back and looked at her. My cock was softening in her mouth and there was a twinkle in her eyes. "That was the best blowjob I ever had," I said. 

She popped my cock out of her mouth. "Thank you, Mr. Williams, but that's my first time sucking you. Next time will be better." 

"I may not live through next time." 

"I haven't killed a man yet," she said. She put my cock back in her mouth. 

"Stop, Mary," I said quietly. 

"Yes, Mr. Williams," she whispered. 

Looking cocky and happy, she was in the classic submissive position - legs spread wide, breasts lifted toward me, hands on thighs, and head slightly lowered and looking up at me through her lashes. 

"Did your husband train you to do that?" 

She quickly stood and stepped away. She was focused and intent, her words clipped and firmly spoken. "I tried to train him to be dominant because I like being submissive, Jack, but you need to understand that I'm not compulsive about it. I've had a lot of offers since my divorce, but you're the only man I've fucked. I'm glad I did. I like you. I like talking to you and fucking you and sucking your cock. You light my fire like no man I've ever met, and that includes my husband." She sighed happily. "Let's talk about limits. If I was going to be with you always, there wouldn't be any limits. But if I'm not always going to be with you? Well, I've got to be practical." 

"Let's go to bed," I said as I pulled her into my arms. I led her to my bedroom. 

When she saw the restraints, she giggled. "It's been a long time since I was tied to a bed." She bounced on the bed and flopped back in a spread-eagle position. Her eyes sparkled as I tied her that way. 

"See you later," I said. I slipped my jockeys over her head. 

"Jack, don't," she whined. I didn't answer. "Jack, I don't want to be blindfolded. Jack? Jack!" She jerked against the ropes. "Let me go, damn you. Jack? You bastard. Jack!" She panicked, yanking against the ropes like a woman possessed as she cursed me and begged for release. 

I let her struggle until she was sweat-covered before I buried my face in her pussy. She squealed, drove her pubis against my face, and came. "Jack! God, don't stop! Eeee. More. That's it! I. Eeee. Oh, God, Jack, I can't stop cumming. Eeeee. Fuck me. Please! Oh, God. Ee. Eee." 

I released her legs and pinned them by her ears with my hands behind her knees. My cock found her pussy. I eased in as slowly as possible. 

"I can't move this way. Let me go. Please. Oh, God, don't take him out slow like that. Jack, you're killing me. Do it fast. I'll do anything for you. I promise. But fuck me hard. Jack, you don't know how I need it." Her muscles were straining and twitching. My sweat dripped on her slick skin. "Faster. Please, Jack. Please." 

I couldn't hold back any longer. I pumped faster. "Uh. Uh. Uh," she groaned with each stroke. The tension in her legs was growing. Her pussy started tightening on my cock like a vise. I released her legs, covered her mouth with my hand to stifle the scream I heard growing, and held on for dear life. Her pussy was so tight I couldn't ejaculate until her muscles relaxed. It spasmed as if being shocked, milking me dry. 

"Oh, shit, can you fuck," she groaned before her eyes snapped shut. She was out for the night. I barely had the strength to untie her before I was asleep. 

She hadn't moved when I awakened at five in the morning. I had an early golf date with a general contractor I wanted to impress and we were teeing off right after dawn. Mary was a zombie. I dressed her, helped her to my truck, and drove her home. Becky opened the door to find me with Mary comatose in my arms. 

"What happened?" she asked as she led me to their bedroom. 

"Hard night," I replied. "Where's her bed?" 

Becky and Mary had the larger of the two bedrooms in the house, but it wasn' t big. They had bunk beds. 

"Put her on mine. The lower one," Becky said. 

"Mary," Becky called sharply as she sat down by her. "Are you all right?" 

"Uh, huh." 

"What happened?" 

"He fucked me. He fucked me like I've never been fucked," Mary mumbled. She rolled toward the wall and promptly went back to sleep. 

Becky looked at me and laughed. "How are you?" she asked. 

"Happy, but I've got a golf game. I need to go." 

As she walked me to the door, Becky said, "We're taking the kids to a water park this afternoon. Why don't you join us?" 

"Me? At a kid's park?" 

"Jack, there are scads of young mothers at this place, and only a few men. There will be plenty of eye candy," she teased. "Come with us." Her hand was on my arm. 

"What time?" I asked. 

"Is two okay?" 

"Sure. I'll come back here." 

My golf game was tedious because the contractor was an aggressive son-of-a- bitch who liked to double his bets. It took patience and effort to keep the score close enough so I'd only win a little of his money. He was a shrewd old bird and knew what I was doing. My strategy worked. He said he had some work for me. 

I arrived a little before two at Mary and Becky's house wearing a polo shirt, shorts, and Docksiders. I had a pair of baggy trunks and a Speedo in my gym bag. 

"Hi, stud," Becky said when she answered the door. She gave me a quick kiss on the lips. "The van's almost loaded." 

The three of them were in swimsuits with cover-ups. Mary wore a nylon, multicolored thing that looked like a robe and came to her knees. Monica wore tight shorts, a tee shirt that left her midriff bare, and strap shoes with three inch heels. The suit top was visible through the tee shirt. Becky wore a baggy shorts and a loose pull-over shirt that came to mid thigh. 

The van was an old Dodge only a step away from the junk yard, but it held four adults, three kids, and their stuff without a problem. They insisted I drive. Monica rode shotgun with Becky, Veronica, and Tiffany in her car seat in the middle. Mary and Jimmy in his car seat were in back. In the rear view mirror, I could see Becky's Mona Lisa smile. Monica turned to give me the best view of her legs and the shoe dangling off her rhythmically kicking foot. Between her legs and Becky's smile, it's a wonder we arrived safely. 

We found a plot of grass at the park, laid out the towels, and opened the large umbrella to keep the sun off us if it got too hot. Mary, who was exhausted from the night before, threw aside her cover up. She wore a modest one piece suit that looked good on her. She picked up Jimmy and announced, "I'm going to the kiddy pool." 

Monica made sure I was watching before she removed her outer clothes to reveal a tight, hard body in a two-piece suit that was only a bit less revealing than a bikini. "I'll take Veronica, Becky," she said. "Come on, girls." Veronica and Tiffany followed her as she twitched toward the large pool full of kids and mothers. 

"My turn," Becky said. 

"To do what?" 

"To undress for you," she said. 

When Becky removed her shirt and shorts, a modest two piece suit emphasized one hell of a body. My expression showed my appreciation and her eyes twinkled a little brighter. 

"I hope you brought racing briefs. Girls like eye candy, too." 

I changed in the locker room. As I walked back to where Becky waited for me, I was aware that several of the other mothers were eying me. 

"Nice body, Jack. I was watching the mothers' reactions as you walked by. I think one of them came. Do you want me to point her out to you?" she teased. 

"No. I'm with a woman I want." 

"Oh? You are?" 

"Don't act surprised." 

"I'm not surprised. I'm pleased because I want you, too, but you should really look at this one." She took my arm and turned me around. A big-breasted red head with wild, sensual eyes was staring at me. She reddened and looked away. 

"Do you want her, Jack?" Becky whispered conspiratorially. Her breasts were pressed into my side and arm. Her heat infused me. 

"I want them all." I looked at my temptress rather than the mother. "But I can't have them all and you know that." 

"How many can you have?" 

"I don't know. I'm still counting." 

"But how many is enough?" She moved to be directly in front and against me. From thigh to chest, her body heated mine. Her arms were around my waist. A tip of her finger slipped under the elastic band of my suit and a fingernail scratched the top of my ass crack. "How many women does it take to satisfy a man like you?" 

"Why single me out? I'm not different than other men." 

"Yes, you are. First, you're smarter and better looking than most. Mary tells me you're the best in bed, but that's only the beginning. By the age of thirty, most men have been married at least once. They have kids and mortgages and in- laws. Not you. You're a hunter, hunting us down like deer. When do you become a gatherer, gathering in those women you want to keep, and quit hunting?" 

My cock throbbed as it fought the restraints of the suit. Becky slid her finger over my skin from the base of my spine until it was between us. She pulled the nylon away from my skin and the head of my cock sprang out. She wrapped her hand around my cock head and slowly squeezed. Every beat of my heart made it throb. 

"What's she doing, Jack?" 

"Playing eye games with me, trying to keep from looking at us. She's looking now. She can't look away. She's lifting her breasts to me. Arching her back. Her nipples are hard under her suit. Her eyes are begging me to come to her." 

"Do you want her?" 

"Yes, but not now." 

"Oh, go on, Jack. Go to her. I'll wait here for you. Or tell me to seduce her for you and I will." 

"Let go of my cock, Becky, but don't move aside. Wait until it goes down and put it back in my suit." 

"You're going to miss out on her and she's a tasty treat for a man like you." 

"She is a tasty treat and I do want to fuck her, but that's enough, Becky. Talk about something that will make my hard-on go away." 

She laughed. "I'll tell you what it's like to change a dirty diaper." She did, describing it in great detail. I'd changed my younger siblings when I lived at home. Her description made the smells and sights of those memories flood my mind and my cock wilted. She tucked it in my suit and gently patted it through the material. 

I pulled her hands off my body and sat down. Becky sat by me so our thighs pressed together. The young mother was still glancing at me. Becky was right. I could fuck that woman within five minutes. But Becky was with me. Sitting sweetly by me. Watching me. Waiting for me. 

"What are you up to?" I asked. 

"It was a test, Jack." 

"A test?" 

"Yes. You passed." 

"I'll give you a test and let's see if you pass," I said testily. "Get her name and phone number. Find out what time would be convenient for me to call." 

Becky's eyes searched to see if I was bluffing, but she didn't find an answer. The light in her eyes dimmed. She started to get up and I stopped her. "That's enough. You passed," I said. "Did you like the test, Becky?" 

"No, but I would've done it." 

"I didn't like mine either. What's the point in testing me?" 

She wasn't going to tell me what she was thinking. Instead she said, "I'm sorry." 

"Apology accepted, but I don't understand the game you're playing." 

Her soft brown eyes watched me passively before her usual twinkle appeared. She kissed me lightly on the lips. I put my hand behind her head and kissed her harder. It was a good kiss. Her eyes gleamed. 

Holding hands, we walked over a knoll to a secluded section with a ten lane lap pool, hot tub, and sunning area. Becky and I took adjoining lanes. I'm a decent swimmer, but she was a fish in the water. She swam effortlessly, yet easily drew away. I stopped to catch my breath and to watch her efficient and powerful strokes as she completed twenty laps in less time than I could' ve done ten. 

She swam over to the pool edge where I sat watching her. She hooked my calves under her arms for support. That omniscient smile and delightful twinkle stared unabashedly at me. 

"How long have you been swimming?" I asked. 

"I started as a kid. I swam competitively until Veronica came along." 

"You're beautiful to watch when you swim." 

"Thanks. You're beautiful to watch when you fuck." She laughed. "And you blush beautifully, too." She stared at my crotch. "Are you hard?" 

"No." 

"Umm. Nice." She kissed the fat of my left calf before swimming to the stairs. We held hands as we walked back toward our towels. 

Mary was plodding toward our area when Becky and I returned. "Monica has all three kids. She could use some help," she grumped. 

I spent the next three hours or so acting like a man with children. I did my time with Jimmy in the kiddy pool, played with Tiffany, and rode the big slide with Veronica squealing happily as she sat in front of me. It was the longest time I'd spent with kids since I left my Dad's home when I was seventeen. Surprisingly, I was the adult who wanted to stay and play longer. 

I spent little time with Mary, who slept or tended Jimmy. Becky and, to a lesser extent, Monica were the women occupying my time. I didn't mind. I wanted them both. They wanted me, too. One or the other was touching me when they were near. Once, when we were in chest high water, Becky had cupped my cock through the suit as she kissed me. 

I was hungry as a bear when we left the water park. The women offered to cook when we got home, but I couldn't wait. I stopped at a burger joint and we all piled out of the van. Jimmy was awake and active, but Veronica was exhausted, and I carried Tiffany in because she was asleep. It was eight at night when we got to Mary's house. 

"Thanks for a lovely afternoon," Monica said. "We're going to call it a day." 

Tiffany gave me a big hug, a wet kiss on the cheek, and thanked me for playing with her. Monica pressed her body into mine, kissed me on the lips, and said, "Have fun tonight."  

===

"I'm going to bed," Mary announced. She kissed me and whispered in my ear, "You fucked me out last night. I'm beat." She and Jimmy disappeared down the hall. 

"Good night, Mr. Williams. Thank you for playing with me," Veronica said. She kissed me sweetly on the cheek. 

"I'll be right back, Jack. Don't go away," Becky said before following her daughter to the bedroom area. 

When Becky returned, she'd changed from her cover-ups into a cotton night shirt that came to her knees. I suspected it was all she wore. Clearly, she was braless. She set down on the couch and put her feet on the coffee table. "Take off your shoes and sit down, Jack," she said. 

"I want you," I said. 

"I want you, too. Do you want to do it here or in the truck?" She had that all knowing smile and soft twinkle again. "Something wrong?" 

"Yes. For three nights, Mary and I have slept together and today you're all over me." 

"She said you fucked her silly. I didn't know you let her sleep," she teased. 

"She told you?" 

"She told me everything in great detail. Want me to repeat it?" 

"No, thanks. Then she knows you and I are going to have sex?" 

"She'd be disappointed if we didn't." 

"I don't understand," I said. 

"You don't need to understand. You just need to enjoy me." 

"What about Monica?" I asked. "Am I going to have sex with her?" 

"If you want to." 

"I do." 

"All right, but I'm next." 

"Tell Mary we're going to my place," I said. 

"Are you going to tie me to the bed?" she asked. 

"Not unless you ask for it." 

"Mary may be right," she replied. 

"About what?" 

"You'll see. Let me get my things." 

To be continued.

Hello, Dear Readers, This is another story written under the name Ezra Zane for Ruthie's Club and published by it last year. It was edited by that wonderful lady, Ruthie. I do hope you enjoy it. E.Z. 

Becky wore the sleep shirt and a pair of jeans. When we got into the truck, she slid to the middle and put that seat belt around her. Her hand was on my thigh as I drove to my townhouse. When I stopped in the driveway and turned off the engine, Becky looked serious and a little sad. 

"What's wrong?" 

She spoke softly and with deep feeling. "My name's Rebecca Anne Morris, and Anne is spelled with an 'e'. I have an older sister, a younger brother, and my parents are divorced. I haven't seen any of them since I left home at seventeen. I've got a BBA in accounting and that's the way I earn my living. I'm five feet eight and half inches tall and weigh one hundred fifty-one pounds. My eyes and hair are brown. My measurements are 42DD - 32 - 43. I've got a little girl but I've never been married. I don't know who her father is because I slept around. To be honest, I've lost track of the number of men I've screwed, but I'd be faithful for the right man. I like relaxed, happy times like the water park today, and I'd rather stay home than go out to a bar or nightclub." 

For reasons I didn't understand, my response was of primal importance to her. She was on pins and needles as she studied my face. 

"You've left out a few important things," I said. "You've got a heart as big as all outdoors. You love giving to people important to you. You'd do anything for them. Let me take an educated guess about the sex. You love it, but at this point in your life you want intimacy more." 

That delicious, passive, sexual twinkle appeared in her eyes again. "That's the reason you're such a successful ladies' man. You read us like a book." 

"Come on, Rebecca Anne with an 'e' Morris. I want to make love to you." 

I held her hand as I led her to the bedroom. We undressed and slipped between the sheets to cuddle and talk. Face-to-face and belly-to-belly, we talked and touched and kissed until she lay back. 

"You're a good man, Jack Williams," she said gently. "I like you." Her hand found my cock. I kissed her as I moved on top of her. When we fucked, she didn't close her eyes until near the end and she didn't make a sound other than little gasps or an occasional moan. She felt good under me. Her wide hips and giant breasts were soft, but the muscles underneath were hard. She had rhythm and grace. 

When I was close to coming, I pinned her wrists beside her head. She locked her ankles behind my back, matching me thrust for thrust. Her pussy massaged my cock when I came, but I thought she faked her orgasm. 

"Mary's right," she said as she put her arms around my neck and held me close. "You are a good lover." 

She slept pressed next to me and awakened me at dawn with coffee. 

"Let me know when you're ready for sex," she said as she sat cross legged on the bed beside me. When I indicated I was, she smiled and said, "Lay back. I want to be on top." She saw my expression. "Don't you let the woman get on top?" 

"Rarely." 

"Have you ever let a woman tie you down?" Her eyes were twinkling sexily. She perched on my midsection, wrapped her fingers around my wrists, and slowly pushed my hands back by my head. I wrenched my hands away. 

"No," I said forcefully. 

"Why not?" I didn't answer. "Are you too macho for that?" she teased. Again, she wrapped her fingers around my wrists and pushed my hands down on the bed. I jerked to get away, but her fingers held me like a vise. I had a moment of panic, which made her laugh devilishly. "Let me tie you down sometimes, Jack. I promise you'll enjoy it." 

"I tie the woman down," I said. 

"You don't need to tie me down, but if you want to, go ahead. For now, let me pleasure you." She kissed me hard, sat back, and released my hands. "Don' t move them," she murmured. 

She tantalized me slowly, dragging her breasts over my body, kissing and nipping with her mouth, massaging and caressing with her hands. She had me flying in no time as every square inch of my body seemed to be an erotic zone for her to stimulate. I was twitching like I had palsy when I grabbed her to roll her over, but she shushed me and gently pushed my hands down. She held them there and let our organs find each other. She eased down and stopped with my cock all the way in her. 

"Move," I said. 

"Shhh. Let me do it." Her nipple brushed my face. "Suck me, Jack," she whispered. I suckled her nipple as she rocked gently on my cock. I don't know how long we stayed that way as if in suspended animation, like floating on a salty sea. Suddenly, she quivered and thrust harder. 

"Oh," she moaned. "Ohhh. Oh, Jack, Ohh. Roll me over. Fuck me hard, Jack. Please. Now." 

I rolled her over and her legs tightened around me like a vise. Her arms were around my shoulders. 

"That's it. Fuck me good. Oh, God, Jack, Oh, God, Oh God. Jack. I'm going to cum." 

I thought she was going to crack some ribs as she tightened her legs around me, arched, and dug her nails into my back. She sobbed and tears flowed down her cheeks, but her pussy kept tightening until she giggled and relaxed when I shot my load into her wetness. 

We rested before making breakfast. After we did the dishes, she led me back to bed. I flopped down. She knelt demurely beside me. Something was bothering her. "You haven't had my bottom yet, Jack. Most women don't like anal sex, but I do occasionally." 

"Thanks, Becky. I'd like that, but let's do it some other time. Come cuddle with me." 

"I need to tell you one more thing." She looked apprehensive, maybe even frightened. 

"What is it?" 

She took a deep breath. Her eyes begged me not to be angry with her. "I danced in a gentlemen's club." She wasn't finished talking, so I waited. The words were hard to let go. "And I had sex for money." 

"Tell me about it." 

"I danced for about two years. You've been to a gentlemen's club, haven't you?" 

"A few times." 

"It's a good way for a woman to make good money. I needed the money because I had a little girl to support and I was going to college. A lot of guys offered to pay me for sex while I was dancing, but I only accepted once. He was much older and a successful businessman. I met him once a week for about six weeks before he asked if he could give my name to some of his friends. They became clients, too. Eight of them. I was their girl of choice for almost two years. The last time I had sex with any of them, he paid me to go on a fishing trip. I arranged for another woman to go with me, and there were two men. Dancing and hooking paid off my debt and let me finish college." She smiled. "I'm tight with a dollar, Jack. I've still got part of that money in investments." 

"Would you do it again?" 

"If you mean then and what my life was, the answer's yes. If you mean now, the answer's no, unless there was a reason." 

"Why did you tell me about your life as a pro?" 

"I've never had a relationship with a man that didn't include big lies. I didn't want that with you." 

"If you're asking for forgiveness, Becky, I forgive you. If you're asking if it bothers me, it doesn't. If you're asking if I want you to do it again, the answer's no." 

"Thank you, Jack," she whispered gratefully. She wiped away the tears welling in her eyes. 

"We need to talk about the relationship. It's only started." 

"I know, but it might last a long time." She had that sexy, all knowing twinkle and Mona Lisa smile again. 

"And it might be over tomorrow," I countered. 

"I doubt it. You told Mary the woman ends it by lying to you or trying to change you. I'll never lie to you and I won't try to change you. I like you the way you are. So, you'll have to end it, Jack, because I won't." 

"Tell me two more things." I said. I touched her belly half way between her belly button and her pubic bone where she had a tattoo identical to Mary's. "Tell me about that and tell me what's going on." 

"I will if you insist, but I'm asking you to please wait." 

"I'll wait, but I don't like it." 

"You will," she replied. "In the meantime, how about a nice long fuck?" 

"I'm too pooped to pop," I said. 

"Come on. I'll give you a bath." 

My tub was designed for two people, although probably not two as big as we were. Her strong hands massaged my back, shoulders, and arms. We dried each other, dressed, and started for Mary's house. 

After halfway there, Becky said, "Jack, I know you play bondage games because you've played them with Mary, but have you ever disciplined a woman?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Spanked her hard, like maybe with a hairbrush?" 

"Never done it," I lied. 

"That's too bad. Monica will need it." 

"Want to tell me more?" 

"No," she said. "You can figure it out." 

Everyone was waiting for us. Mary kissed me hotly as Jimmy and Tiffany tugged on my pants leg. When I leaned down to pick up Jimmy, the women disappeared and Veronica showed up. With Jimmy in my lap and a girl on each side, I read them a book until the three mothers reappeared. 

"We thought we'd have lunch and then go to a movie. There's a great kids show at the Cineplex." 

They made soup and sandwiches with chips. All of us ate at the table with me at the head again. I don't know what the women had discussed when they huddled in the bedroom, but there was a strong sexual undercurrent in the room. 

After lunch, Monica said, "I want to stay here and talk to Jack. Why don't you two take the kids to the movie?" 

So that was their agreement. After the others left, Monica stood in the middle of the living room. She wore shorts that fit her curves closely and a sleeveless blouse unbuttoned to the bottom of her breasts. She was braless. Clearly, she was dressed to attract attention. 

"Something wrong?" I asked. 

"No, sir," she said. 

"Do I frighten you?" 

"You never have, but Becky told me what she said to you." 

"Which was?" 

"To punish me, but you don't need to punish me, Jack." 

"Why not?" 

"I don't need it. Sure, I like big, strong guys who'll hold me down and make me beg for my fucking, and I hear you're like that. You don't need to spank me with a hairbrush." 

"I promise I'll do it only under one circumstance. That is if I'm absolutely sure you want it." 

She visibly relaxed. When I kissed her, she melted into my arms. 

"I want to undress you." 

Those bedroom blue eyes glowed. "Help yourself," she said sexily. 

I unzipped her shorts. She wiggled as I tugged and they fell to the floor. I unbuttoned the remaining buttons on her blouse, pulled it off her shoulders, and dropped it to the floor. 

"Stand right there. I want to look at you," I said. I plopped down in a chair. 

Monica's face was the most beautiful of the three in the classic sense of the word. She had high cheekbones, alabaster skin, and beautiful blue eyes. Her figure was an hourglass of excellent proportion. She knew how appealing she was as she stood wearing only panties, her shorts bunched around her feet. She played the game, pouting and looking up at me through her lashes. 

"What are your measurements?" 

"34C-23-35." 

"Take off your panties," I said. 

"Yes, sir," she replied in a little girl voice. She stepped out of her shoes and shorts, wiggled her panties down her legs, and kicked them away. On tiptoes, she slowly turned around, stopping once to give me a Coppertone-girl pose. 

Her pubis was hairless and there was a gold ring in her outer labia. And the tattoo was there, identical to and in the same place as Becky's and Mary's. I wiggled my finger and she came to me. With hands on her waist, I drew her closer to explore her hills and valleys before I pulled her down to sit on my lap, with her legs outside mine. She put her arms around my neck to kiss me and her tongue played with mine. 

"I've got some questions," I said. 

"Go ahead." 

"Is your pussy permanently hairless?" 

"Yes, Jack. I had electrolysis." 

"Who put the ring in your pussy?" 

"My husband, Del." 

"Can it be removed?" 

"No. It would have to be cut out surgically." 

"Why did he want you to have the pussy ring?" 

"Sometimes he attached a leash to it. Sometimes I wore a chain that would hang below my hemline. The other end of the chain had a medallion, you know, like a dog tag with his name on it to show he owned me." 

"How often did he make you wear the medallion?" 

"Often enough." 

"Did you like that?" 

"Sometimes." 

"Do you like being owned?" 

"Yes. Well, I don't know. Maybe. Sometimes." 

My hands slid up her thighs and over her hips to cup her ass. I pulled her closer and she ground her pussy into me. My cock was growing. When it bumped into her crotch, she put her hand between us and tried to get him in her, but I pulled away. 

"Let me have him," she said. 

I struggled to my feet with Monica hanging onto me, lay her back on the floor, and slid my cock into her. Mary had been hot and ready. Her eagerness and joy brought pleasure to her and her man. Becky knew how to please a man. She didn't care whether she came or not as long as I was happy. But Monica was cool to the touch, as if letting the man have her body was reward enough for him. I'd seen that before in beautiful women. By the time I came, I knew Monica was the lousiest lay of the three, and one of the worst I ever had. 

Monica and I scurried to get into our clothes when we heard the van in the driveway. Within minutes, I was on the couch with my feet on the coffee table, watching a kid show on television. Monica was sitting on my right with her hand on my leg and Tiffany in her lap. Becky was on my left with her hand on my leg and Veronica beside her. Mary was on the floor at my feet, playing with Jimmy, but she stroked my leg intermittently. 

At dinner, I sat at the head of the table for homemade meatloaf, mashed potatoes, green beans, with ice cream sundaes for dessert. I read the kids a story before helping put Jimmy to bed. 

"We drew straws, Jack. I get you for tonight," Becky announced. We left for my apartment with Becky's suitcase in hand. Again, she sat in the middle seat with her hand on my leg. 

When we walked through the door, she asked, "How about a massage?" She stretched a sheet of plastic across the bed. I removed my clothes and lay face down on the plastic. She removed her clothes, opened the massage oil container, and began to work on me. Her hands were strong. 

"You're good," I said. 

"Thanks. I took some training in it, but I can do a lot of other things too." 

"Such as?" 

"Cook, nurture children, repair household appliances, prepare a budget and stick to it, balance books, select pension plans. A woman for all seasons." 

"Don't forget fuck like crazy." 

"That, too. I enjoy it, Jack. I enjoy you." She kissed me on the cheek. "That was the first orgasm I had from a man since before I started hooking, and it was the best one I can remember." 

"Thanks, but I'm surprised you don't have them all the time." 

"Don't be. I can fake it with the best of them." 

"Do you date often?" 

"I usually have one or two dates a month, but I haven't screwed any of them in a long time." Her hands stopped their rhythmic massage. "I'm having an affair with my boss. We slip out one afternoon every week." 

"Lucky dog." 

"He is a dog. We were having a cutback at the company when he gave me the choice of being laid off or laid." 

"Ouch." 

"Well, it wasn't so bad. It's a good job." 

"I mean that hurt." 

"Sorry. You must be tender there." 

"I wasn't. Don't take out your anger on me. I'm a fragile little guy." 

"Oh, poor baby," she laughed. "There's nothing little about you. Wait a minute. Roll back on your face. I'm not finished." 

"I want to see you." 

"Why?" 

"I like looking at you," I said. 

She poured more oil in her hands and started on my thighs. "I like looking at you, too, sweet talker." 

"Tell me about your boss." 

"Average everything. If he'd romanced me a little, I might've had an affair with him, but he didn't give me a chance. I think making a demand of me and having me comply with it was a power trip that played with his head. That power is more important to him than the sex." 

"Is he a demanding master?" 

"He thinks he is," she said with a laugh. "But I set strict limits. I don't wear any man's collar." 

"Do you want to continue it?" She gave me that enigmatic Mona Lisa smile again. I changed the subject. "What about women?" 

"What about them?" she teased. 

"Don't be coy. Inquiring minds want to know." 

"Occasionally, I meet another woman who catches my interest. Maybe three or four a year." 

"What appeals to you?" 

"You do." 

"In women." 

"That young mother at the pool appealed to me, but I couldn't have pulled it off." 

"I could have. Is that the reason you pointed her out?" 

"No. It really was a test," she said. 

"If I failed the test, there could've been an interesting side effect." 

"Jack," she said intensely. "You have no idea how much I wanted you to pass that test, and you did with flying colors." Her face was a good face. Pretty, with strength and character, and beautiful in its own way. More than that, she had a natural sensuality that glowed. "Have you figured it out yet?" 

"What do you mean?" I asked. 

"About us. Monica, Mary, and me." 

"Yes," I replied smugly. 

"Oh? What is it?" 

"The three of you are going to try to get me to marry one of you, but it won 't work." 

"We understand that." 

"You're welcome to keep trying. I'm enjoying myself." 

"I hope so. Did you spank Monica?" 

"No." 

"Then she was lousy in bed," Becky said in a matter-of-fact tone. Her hands passed over my middle and started on my chest. 

"You're right. How did you know?" 

"That's the way she is. After you demonstrate your strength so she'll feel safe being under your control, she'll be as hot as Mary, but you have to take her, Jack. I mean in the old fashioned sense of physical domination." 

"Why do you hang out with her?" 

"I love her." 

"Love her how?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"You know what I mean." 

"No, I don't. Do you mean do I love her like a sister, which she is to me? Or do I love her like she was my child? That's different than a sister, but sometimes she's like my child, too. Or do you mean do I love her like a woman loves another woman, which can mean either platonically like very closest friends, or as lovers with face to pussy?" 

"Which way do you love her?" I asked. 

"All of the above." 

"You and Monica have sex." 

"Yes. I'm a true bisexual, Jack." 

"When you said you'd be faithful, that didn't include women?" 

She had a big grin and a mischievous twinkle. "The right man wouldn't ask me to give them up. He'd enjoy them, too." 

"Makes sense," I said. "How about you and Mary?" 

"In bed? Sure, but not regularly. Usually it's when some man insists. Mary enjoys it, but she'll never admit that. If a man tells her to pleasure a woman, it removes her guilt." She put more lotion on her hands and her thoughts were introspective. "I'm like Monica in some ways, like Mary in others. I was a bitch." 

"What changed you?" 

"Growing up, I guess. I'm ready to settle down." 

"I won't marry you, Becky." 

"I didn't ask." 

"What the hell is going on?" I said firmly. 

"Make love to me, Jack." 

"Not until you tell me what's going on." 

"Can't you wait until the weekend?" she asked. "Please. For us. For me." 

"I don't think so." 

"Which part has been so bad, Jack? Three women making love to you day and night? The cuddling and cooing? The home cooked meals? The water park, where we had to practically drag you out of the place to go home? The kids, which you enjoy more than you'll admit? What didn't you like?"  

===

"Okay. It's been a lot of fun. Well, hell, it's been the best time I've ever had, but what's so special about the weekend?" I asked. 

"It was going to be a surprise, but since you insist on knowing. We reserved a cabin at The Cedars." 

"The Cedars? You must be planning something special." 

"We are." 

"All right. I'll keep my curiosity in check until the weekend." 

She leaned over me, resting on her elbows. "I've got an itch I can't scratch. Got any ideas?" 

"My scratcher needs attention," I said. 

"That, I can do. Mouth or boobs?" 

"Both." 

She sucked my cock until he rose, then lay back and handed me the massage oil. I poured it liberally over her body. 

"You're going to get your sheets oily," she said. That soft, passive, sexy twinkle was in her eyes again. I was growing to love that look. 

"They'll wash, and so will we." I spread the oil from her shoulders to her thighs. When I jammed a finger in her pussy and tickled, she moaned. I kneaded her flesh from breasts to thigh, feeling it ooze through my hands. I straddled her mid section. She guided my cock to her mouth for a quick kiss before holding it between her breasts. I gently began to thrust. I had no desire to orgasm. I lost myself in the feel of her beneath me and her breasts around my cock. When I couldn't stand the throbbing in my nuts, I slipped between her legs. 

"I do love fucking you, Jack," she whispered. 

***** 

That was Sunday with Becky. Monica was Monday and Tuesday. Monica was a good conversationalist who was both witty and bright. In bed though, she was marginal, letting me masturbate using her cool body. If it had been Monica alone and not the three of them, Tuesday would've been our last date. Mary was Wednesday. She was eager, ready, and a lot of fun. 

Thursday, I had an emergency job and didn't see them. The woman of the house made it clear that I could have her. She was good looking enough, and eager enough, but I turned her down. I told her I was in a relationship. Saying that surprised the hell out of me. I did some heavy thinking about those three good friends who fell into my life. Some very heavy thinking. 

I arrived at Mary's house at six thirty Friday evening. A Mrs. Potter, who was around sixty, was firmly entrenched as protector of the three kids. I loaded their luggage, which included two heavy bags and two insulated coolers, into the back of the truck, kissed the children goodbye, and loaded the three women. Monica rode shotgun. 

The Cedars was a resort with all the amenities, including a choice of a room in the lodge or a secluded cabin. We had a cabin. We arrived about eight thirty, checked in, and crossed the threshold of our weekend hideaway shortly before nine. The living room had two long couches that made into queen sized beds, several heavy straight chairs, and a soft, plush carpet. The kitchen and dining room were small but serviceable. The bedroom was massive, with a larger than king sized bed. I guessed it could sleep four easily and six in a pinch. Opposite it was a big screen TV, VCR, and stereo system. The bathroom was bigger than my bedroom at home and contained a full complement of facilities. As promised, two walls of the bedroom were mirrored. Another wall had the closet and entertainment center. The fourth wall was a sliding glass door that exited to a patio and hot tub. 

"Nice," Mary murmured as she looked around. 

"Very nice," Monica agreed. 

We unloaded the truck, put the food away, and took bathroom breaks. When I returned to the living room, they were in a huddle, whispering intently. 

They guided me to one of the straight chairs they had moved opposite a couch. When I sat down, Mary fell to her knees to remove my shoes and socks while Becky massaged my shoulders and Monica brought me a glass of wine. The three of them sat side by side on the couch with Becky in the middle. They were nervous, giggly, and held hands for mutual support. I was calm and cool as a preacher at a funeral, which is how I react when my adrenalin is boiling. 

"Jack," Becky began. "We have a proposition for you." 

"I'm all ears." 

Becky took a deep breath. "Jack, we three have enjoyed these ten days." 

"Loved it," Mary interrupted. 

"We want to do it a long time," burst out of Becky in a rush. "Like forever." 

"She didn't mean forever, Jack," Mary gasped out. 

All three of them were on edge. The funny thing was the word "forever" would have sent me running from the room in stark terror just a few weeks ago, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected. 

"We want you to move in with us," Becky concluded. 

"Us?" I asked. 

"I'd move in, too," Monica said. 

"The house is too small," I commented. 

"We've been looking for a bigger place so Monica could move in. Finding a larger one shouldn't be a problem." 

"How would you pay for it?" I said, buying time to ease my whirling mind. 

"Mary's grandmother left her the house we're in now. It's free and clear. She'd sell it and we've all got some savings. Together that makes the down payment. The three of us make enough money to support the mortgage. Getting the house is the easy part and we three can live together without a lot of problems." Mary's eyes flicked at Monica. "If the four of us lived together, we'd have to agree on rules to live by." 

"I wouldn't live anywhere I didn't pay my own way," I said. 

"I told you," Mary said out of the corner of her mouth. 

"And I wouldn't live anywhere I didn't make the rules. All the rules." 

"All the rules?" Monica asked. 

"Yes. All of them." 

"Okay, Jack. If you make all the rules, and we agree to abide by them, then you'll do it?" Mary asked. 

"I didn't say that." 

"What did you say?" Becky asked. 

"Yes. What was it?" Monica added. 

"I'm not sure what you're suggesting," I said. "If it's an equal partnership, then there are four votes, one for each of us. You three are lifelong friends and could be expected to vote together on everything. I wouldn't agree to that." I stood up. 

"Where are you going?" Mary said. 

"To get another glass of wine," I replied. 

"I'll get it for you," Monica said, taking my wine glass. 

I didn't want more wine. I wanted time to think. When Monica returned, I sipped and waited. Mary couldn't stand it. "Well? What do you suggest?" she demanded. 

"What do you suggest?" I countered. 

"Don't you want to do it?" she asked plaintively. 

"I'd love to do it, Mary, under the right agreement. You three are beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and loving women. Living with the three of you would be any man's dream." 

"Tell us that dream, Jack," Becky said. 

"First, you tell me about the identical tattoos on your tummies." 

They responded with an embarrassed giggle, an open sexuality, and an "I-knew- it" grin, respectively. Becky cleared her throat self-consciously. "Jack, it shouldn't be a surprise that we all enjoy sex. In high school, we were pretty wild." 

"We were sluts," Mary said. 

"No, we weren't," Monica snapped. 

"We screwed a lot of guys so you can call us what you want. We decided to get tattoos," Becky said. 

"It wasn't common then, Jack. It was naughty," Mary exclaimed. 

"When I first saw Mary's, I thought the 'J' was for Jim, but when I saw all three, I knew it had to be something else," I said. 

"It's for Jezebels," Monica told me. 

"Jezebels?" I queried. "And the triangle's inverted, like Superman." 

"Right," Monica replied with a lewd little grin. 

"Jezebels, the super sluts," Mary said sheepishly. 

"I'm not the first guy all three of you have fucked, am I?" 

"No," Becky said. "That's the way we did it. If one of us had him, all three did." 

"How many?" 

"I have no idea," Becky said. "There was the football team." 

"And basketball," Mary added. 

"But we only did the starters on each of them." 

"Don't forget Darrell." 

"Add the nerds, of which Darrell was the worst." 

"He proposed to all three of us." 

"So did his brother." 

"God, what losers." 

"We did some of the teachers." 

"Becky's brother." 

"And both of mine," Monica added. "We fucked maybe seventy guys in high school." 

"How about college?" 

"It slowed down for me when Veronica was born. Monica started dating Del when they were sophomores. That took her out of circulation. Mary met Jim when they were juniors. We got all the sex we wanted, but it wasn't the same." 

"How about girls?" I asked. 

Mary blushed and covered her face. Monica's eyes flitted between Becky and me. Becky never looked away. 

"Girls, too," Becky said. "But not necessarily all three." 

"Why not?" 

"I told you I'm bisexual. Mary's not." 

"And I'm not. Well, maybe. Sometimes," Monica said. 

"It doesn't turn me off," Mary interjected. "I do it to please a man, or to please Becky, rather than pleasing myself, if you know what I mean." 

"So, all three of you screwed guys and gals. Does that include the two husbands?" 

"Sure. We all three did Jim any time he asked," Mary said. 

"Good Lord, why did he leave you?" 

"Got religion, he said," Mary answered. "I want you to know something, Jack. When I decided to marry Jim, I never cheated on him. I never fucked another guy from that day forward - except Del, but Jim knew about that before we married." 

"How many men have you had since he left?" 

"You're the first," she said. "Well." She cleared her throat, reddened slightly, and gave a nervous half-smile. "Jack, are blowjobs sex?" 

"They are the way you do them," I said, grinning at her. 

"I've given six or seven different guys blowjobs since Jim left, so I guess I've had sex." 

"And most men think blowjobs are cheating." Becky said. "At least they do when they wives or girlfriends give them." 

"Meaning what?" I asked. 

"Meaning I was queen of the cocksuckers in high school and college," Mary said. "Jim knew and he understood that I need cum like other women need chocolate. When I said I never cheated, that meant no guy ever had my pussy. I sucked off a lot while I was married to Jim." 

"How about now?" I asked. 

"I've got two guys I do regularly. One's twice a week or so. The other is every business day." 

"Every day?" I asked. 

"He's the owner's husband. He wants his cock sucked when he comes by to pick up the day's receipts." 

"How about you, Monica?" 

"How about me what?" she asked innocently. 

"Don't play games with me." 

"I don't think my sex life is any of your business," she replied haughtily. 

"Tell him or we will," Becky said. 

Monica gave her a dirty look, but she said, "I was Del's playtoy. I did whatever he told me to do." I waited. "You want details?" 

"Yes," I answered. 

"You name it. Playing games, swinging, gangbangs, fucking his friends, having sex in public, dogs, B&D. A lot of B&D." 

"What parts did you like?" 

"All of it except the really rough stuff." Her jaw was set, her face intent. Head high. Breasts thrust out. Eyes challenging. 

"Tell me about the games." 

"His favorite one was master-slave. We played that most of the time, but there were others. We'd play doctor-patient, cop and crook, French maid and aristocrat. I even had costumes for them. One game he called 'rape.' He'd take me someplace like a sleazy bar or frat house, get everyone's attention, and tell them I liked to be raped." 

"Do you?" 

"I hate it," she hissed. 

"But you like master-slave?" 

"With the right master," she said. 

"Tell me about the dogs." 

"What's to tell?" 

"I've never seen that." 

"Buy me a dog," she said, with a lewd little grin. 

"Did you do drugs?" 

"No. Del dealt, but he didn't give them to me." She smiled wanly, but her eyes held a message for me. "He didn't need to. I did everything he asked." 

"Mary?" 

"No drugs, Jack," she replied. 

"Becky?" 

"No, sir." 

"What else do you need to tell me?" I asked Monica. 

"Nothing," Monica replied, but I knew she was lying. 

"Ladies, let's not lie to each other. Agreed?" 

All three said yes. 

"What else, Monica?" 

"Becky was doing some hooking. Her client wanted two girls to entertain a group for a week. I went along." 

"You lied to me," I snarled at Becky. 

She blanched. "No, I didn't. That part was Monica's to tell you," she stammered. 

"A half truth is as bad as a lie." 

"I'm sorry," she whispered. 

I knew Becky was the key. She was the biggest and strongest physically, but that wasn't all of it. She was the toughest mentally and emotionally. The dominant one of the three. I had to bend her to me if I wanted this thing to be successful. Oh shit! Did I want it to be successful? They were watching me as my brain churned that problem. I needed to get on with this, so I took a deep breath and said, "Do you want to correct any thing else you told me?" 

"No, sir," Becky said shamefaced. 

"I'm disappointed in you, Becky," I said and my voice reinforced the words. She looked hang-dog. 

"Mary, did you ever play for pay?" 

"No, Jack." She looked insulted. 

"What else did you do?" 

"Not as much as Monica, but a lot. Even the dog, but I only did one. Charlie. He was a Lab." 

"Where is your husband, Monica?" 

She looked surprised. "What do you mean?" 

"You've never said what happened to him. Are you divorced?" 

"He's dead, Jack. The police killed him in a drug bust." 

"I'm sorry to hear that," I said. 

"I'm not. It was pretty bad at the end and I was afraid to leave him." 

"Anybody since then?" 

"If you mean have I gotten laid, the answer's yes." She smiled. "But not a lot. I'm more selective than you think." 

"If you three have had that varied and open a sexual past, why should I think you'll be faithful now?" 

"Do you want us to be faithful?" Becky asked. 

"Yes," I replied. 

"Are you sure? How about that woman at the water park. You wanted her," she continued. 

"What's that got to do with anything?" 

"A lot. Let's assume we agree that you make the rules and we'll abide by them. And let's assume that one of your rules is that we'll be faithful." 

"Does faithful mean no other men or no other men unless you want to swap us?" Mary asked. 

"Or give us to your friends?" Becky added. 

"And does it mean that you'll be faithful?" Monica said. 

"Don't run, Jack. Please," Mary pleaded. "You shouldn't have said that word, Monica." 

"Why not? He used it." 

"Let's take a break," I said. 

"This is hard for us, too," Monica said. "You're not the only one giving up your freedom." 

"It's not hard on me. Tell me what you want," Mary pleaded emphatically. 

"I need some time to think and so do you," I said. "I think I know what I want but I'm not sure." 

"What is it?" Mary asked. Her frustration was evident. 

"I'm sure the three of you have discussed it. Look, I want a break and you three need time to talk." 

I got a soft drink from the kitchen and went in the bedroom to watch TV. Usually, I watch TV nude, but this time I left my clothes on. We had more important things to consider than sex. I tried to relax, but I was uptight. I wished I could've been a bug on the wall listening to them. 

One thing for sure, my life would change. That was a problem because I liked my life. I was getting laid four or five times a week by three or four different women. New ones were always available and the old ones liked a repeat performance. Like it or not, this arrangement would require commitment, and that made my blood run cold. Yet, they were three appealing and special women, and I knew I'd settle down sometime. 

The women joined me in about twenty minutes, but I led them back into the living room where we sat as we had before so I could see their faces. 

"Wine?" Monica asked. 

I needed a clear head to handle this situation, so I told her to bring water or soft drinks for everyone. They were on edge. I was calm - outside. Inside, I was in turmoil. 

"Jack, like I said, we'd like the four of us to live together in one house. You'd be the man of the house, and we would be, for lack of a better word, your wives," Becky began. 

My heart was beating like it was ready to explode. They all had little smirks. They knew what the word "wife" did to me, and "wives" was three times worse. 

"Or, if you'd prefer, like you were the pasha and we were your harem," Becky added. 

"Do harem girls wash and do dishes?" Mary cracked. 

"They do fuck and suck whenever asked," Monica said. 

"I prefer the harem concept," I said. 

"Do you want us to wear costumes, Jack? Maybe like Jeannie on the TV show," Becky teased with tongue-in-cheek. 

"We need to know the basic rules before we finalize the agreement," Monica said sharply. 

"And we need to have the financial part worked out," Becky said. 

"I'm not saying I'll do it. I want to talk to each of you alone to discuss a few things," I said as I stood. "Mary. Let's start with you." 

To be concluded 

Please give me your comments!  

===

I led Mary into the bedroom and shut the door behind us. I sat in a straight chair, but didn't tell Mary what to do. She pushed my knees apart and knelt there. She looked happy and ready to begin. 

"I'm going to ask you some questions. Answer them honestly." 

"All right," she said. 

"Do you really want this agreement, Mary? I don't mean what the group wants, but what you want down deep in your gut?" 

"Yes, Jack." 

"Will you be faithful?" 

"I'm not sure what faithful means, but I'll do anything you want." 

"And obedient?" 

"You know I will." 

"You know I'll have each of you any time I want?" 

"Yes, Jack." 

"I'll want you to have sex with Becky and Monica." 

She wrinkled her nose and grinned. "I don't mind, Jack. Really. I just don't get turned on by it like they do." 

"You don't orgasm from it?" 

"Oh, I orgasm, but not all orgasms are the same." 

"I'll punish you if I think you need it." 

"Oh, Jack, you're a marshmallow," she said. She flushed and covered her mouth. "Oops. That popped right out." 

"All right. I'm easy going, but I'm tough, too. I can enforce the rules, and if you cheat on me, either I'm gone or you're gone." 

"I'll never cheat so don't worry about that. As for punishment, well, if I need it, go ahead." 

"Whose idea was it to ask me to move in with all of you?" 

"Becky's. She's afraid of losing Monica and me to men. You know, breaking up the old trio and leaving her alone. Del and Monica married first. Del tried to subdue Becky like he had Monica, but Becky hated him and she never gave in. When I married Jim, he understood Becky would live with us, but Becky didn't like him either. She thought he was too wishy-washy. It was difficult and, believe me, none of us want to go through all that again." 

"Go ahead." 

"About two months after Jim left, Becky suggested that all of us live with one man. The idea never appealed to me because we'd have to find a man who turned on all three of us. When I met you, I knew you'd be perfect." She stopped and peered out the window to think for a few moments before looking at me again. "Jack, you need to understand women." 

"I never claimed to do that," I joked, but I don't think she heard me because she was focused on her thoughts. 

"We're bonded like glue. We love each other, but not like we love men or even our kids. It's complex. Maybe like sisters, but closer really. It's hard to explain, but they're a part of me and we've been through a lot together. I know this. We'll all be happier if we're together. Something else. Becky and I both want a big family. With three baby makers, we could be a big family, Jack." 

"If I said I didn't want to do this, but I wanted you to come live with me, would you do it?" 

"Yes, Jack. If I'm not already in love with you, I'm falling fast." 

"Anything you want to tell me? Anything I need to know?" 

"Becky told me she told you to discipline Monica and you didn't." 

"That's right." 

"Do you want her?" 

"Yes, I do." 

"You really need to discipline her, Jack. Look. I love you. Oops. I said it." She giggled and flushed pink. She sighed. "I may as well tell you the whole truth, Jack. I do love you. I mean deeply and desperately. I'd marry you or become your mistress or your little playtoy, whatever you want as long as I'm near you." She could tell from my expression that pleased me, and she was pleased that I was pleased. "Becky loves you, too. That frightens her because the other men she loved were cruel to her. But Monica's different than we are. She's crazy about you and wants you to take her, but she can't give herself. She has to be taken." 

"Why are you telling me this? Don't you know that means you'll share me with other women?" 

"Jack, you told me you'd never be faithful and I believe you. I'd rather share you with Becky and Monica than some woman I don't know. And the three of us really are pieces of the same puzzle. I don't want us to split up." 

"I might still have other women," I said. 

"Oh, Jack, if you live with three sex-crazed sluts, you won't have time for other women." She gave me that delightful grin. "But if you want to, go ahead. I'll be waiting at home with my legs spread and my mouth open." 

"I want children," I said. "Will you. . . ." 

She launched herself into me, squealing and burying me in kisses. "I'll have as many as you want," she sighed. 

Monica was next. Again I sat in the straight chair, and I didn't tell Monica what to do. She entered the room and sat on the edge of the bed. I didn't say anything. She stood, took one step toward me, and waited. When I still didn't say anything, she sighed loudly and knelt, but not as Mary had, which was between my legs with her legs spread. Monica knelt by me with hers together. 

I asked Monica the same questions. Yes, she wanted the arrangement, and, yes, she'd be faithful and obedient. Yes, she'd have sex with Mary and Becky, and she admitted she and Becky had sex once or twice a week anyway. Yes, she knew I'd punish her and she'd accept it. And, yes, she'd have my child. 

But there was a big question mark hanging over the entire discussion. A question evidenced by her eyes, her coolness and her tone of voice, and by the way she studied me as we talked. I decided to meet it head on. 

"Monica, I know you like a forceful man and I know you want to be taken." 

Her eyes flared their challenge. "I don't know what you're talking about," she said haughtily. She stood and stepped away. 

"So we'll do it your way," I said. 

She twitched to the door, hesitated, and looked back at me. She strutted back, threw herself against me, and kissed me with all the heat a man could want. "Take me if you can," she hissed. She turned on her heel and swayed out the door. 

It was Becky's turn. For the third time, I sat in the chair to see where the woman would sit. Becky sat on the bed. To my first two questions - do you want this arrangement and will you be faithful - Becky emphatically answered yes. But when I asked if she'd be obedient, she replied, "Within reason," and my antennae went up. 

"What does that mean?" I asked. 

"It means yes, but it gives me an out in case I'm not obedient." I gave her a dirty look. "I expect you to be reasonable, Jack, but people are unreasonable sometimes. I'll be obedient if you're reasonable." 

I sat back and stared at her. She wasn't challenging. She was frightened. "You've always been the independent and dominant one. Giving that up scares you, doesn't it?" I said. 

"Yes," she gasped. 

"I don't blame you, but you'll have to give it up," I said. 

"I know," she replied. "But that's easier said than done." 

As she wiped away a few tears, I said softly, "I won't hurt you, Becky." 

"I know you won't, Jack. It's not that." 

"When you've been hurt badly, it takes a long time to heal," I said. 

"Yes, it does, and it makes you afraid even when a new relationship feels right." She smiled like a sad little girl. "This does feel right, Jack. You feel right." She gave me a shy half-smile. "You've felt right since the minute I saw you, but brains and hearts don't always see eye-to-eye." 

"I sure know that. Do you want to take a break?" 

"No, thanks." 

When I asked if she'd come live with me if the others did not, she said, "I don't know, Jack. I truly don't know. This whole thing was about keeping the three of us together. I know them, Jack. Mary would fall to the first man who excited her. Monica would fall to the first man who excited and dominated her. I want to keep us together, for me and for them. I told you I love them, but it's more than that. Women need other women and we three have been together a long time. Having one man - sharing one husband, if you will - is the best way to keep us together. That Wednesday you came into our lives, I knew if we were to stay together, you were the man." 

"Why?" 

Becky laughed. "You should've seen Mary. She stared out the kitchen window with her mouth hanging open. 'Look at that hunk,' she said reverently. She trotted out to talk to you. When she returned, she went into the bedroom and masturbated. When she came out, she was dressed to seduce you." 

"It worked," I said with a grin. 

"Who seduced who?" she asked. Slowly that delightful, passive twinkle reappeared in her eyes. "You're a good man, Jack. Believe me, I want to do this, but it'll take time for me to give in all the way. Please be patient with me." 

I didn't ask Becky if she'd have sex with Mary and Monica, but I did ask if she'd have my child and she agreed. Then she asked me a question. 

"Are you going to do it, Jack?" 

"My brain and heart are having the same battle yours are." 

"It could be great for all of us, Jack. I'll help you get through it if you'll help me." Her eyes twinkled and that Mona Lisa smile appeared. She sat across my legs and put her arms around my neck. "What do you say, Jack? A home and kids. Warmth and coziness. Three women to love you, wait on you, warm your bed." 

"Three women to have headaches and PMS," I quipped. 

"I know it's going to be rough at times. I'll help you keep Mary and Monica in line." 

"And who keeps you in line?" 

"I'm the easy one because I want this to work more than anyone." She kissed me lovingly. "Please do it, Jack," she said. 

***** I told Becky to join the others. After she left the room, I retrieved three pieces of stout nylon rope and stuck them in my rear pockets. They were sitting on the floor Indian style and whispering to each other when I rejoined them. 

"So far, so good," I said. "But I want to ask this question one more time. Do each of you want this?" 

"Yes, I do," Mary said firmly. 

"Most definitely, Jack," Becky said. 

We all looked at Monica. 

"No," she said defiantly. 

"Dammit it, no, Monica. It's all for one, and one for all," Mary snapped. 

"Monica," Becky said forcefully, "I insist you do it." 

"No," Monica replied more emphatically. She was looking at me, not at Becky. 

"We told you to take her, Jack," Becky said accusingly. Panic was evident in her voice. "Please, Monica. Please," Becky begged. "Tell him yes." 

Monica was distressed by Becky's response, but she had something to prove to me, and to herself about me. "No," Monica repeated. 

"Mary and Becky, I want you to watch what's going to happen. Watch, but don't participate. Understand?" I said. 

"Yes, Jack," they each replied. 

All three of them were on the floor. Mary, dressed in the shorts she wore when I first met her and a tee shirt, knelt and smiled up at me. Becky, in her baggy shorts and top, sat Indian style. As usual, Monica was dressed the most sexily of the three. She wore a cotton crop-top, which had long sleeves and a turtle neck. Like a second skin, its elastic bottom held it tight under her breasts and her hard nipples protruded under the cloth. Her shorts, which were also skin-tight, barely covered her tattoo and her pubis. 

Monica was alive with anticipation as I held out my hand to her. She slapped it away. I sat down in the straight chair and said, "I'm going to spank you, Monica. Come get over my lap." 

"Go to hell," she snapped. 

"Being disobedient will only make it worse for you," I said in a calm and neutral tone. 

"Are you deaf? I said go to hell." 

I feigned standing. She squealed, rolled, and sprang to her feet. The carotid artery in her neck was throbbing rapidly. Her muscles were taught. Most importantly, her nipples were diamonds under her crop top. 

"Let's get on the couch," Becky whispered to Mary. They eased onto the couch and watched us with big, bright eyes. 

I stood and Monica stepped back. I didn't want to catch her immediately so I moved relatively slowly. I wanted to chase her first, to let me enjoy the wild expressions on her face, the heaving of her breasts, and her muscles flexing under her sweat-covered skin. We played cat and mouse, accompanied by squeals and sounds of flying feet on the carpet, until she was tired. By then, she thought it was easy to evade me. Becky thought so, too, and she was concerned I couldn't bring Monica into the fold, but Mary wanted to be the woman being chased and her arousal was evident. 

"It's time, Monica. Come get over my lap so I can spank you," I said with a steely softness. 

"That won't work, Jack," Becky said. 

"Be quiet, Becky. He knows what he's doing," Mary chided. 

From across the room, Monica smirked, yanked up her top to flash her breasts, and said, "Are these what you want?" 

"No, Monica," I replied. She looked confused. "I want all of you, but I want your heart most of all." That was the first time I saw Monica's hard shell crack. I liked that expression. "Come to me," I said caringly. 

Her warm smile and gently twinkling eyes morphed to a sneer and hard, hot eyes. She pulled off her top and threw it aside. She stepped out of her shorts, kicked them away, and put her hands on her hips. "No," she challenged. 

I moved quickly. Amidst squeals and grunts, I wrestled her to the floor, bound her wrists behind her, and tied her ankles together. I lay down beside her on the carpet. Her eyes were sparkling with excitement. "Are you mine now?" I asked. 

"Maybe. Maybe not," she said coyly. 

I stroked her hair back from her face and kissed her on the cheek. "Ready for a spanking?" I asked. 

"Maybe. Maybe not," Monica said. 

"You need to do it, Jack," Becky said. 

"Stay out of it, Becky," Mary said forcefully. 

When I stood to remove my belt, I saw her smile at her friends, who were still as church mice. I pulled upward on Monica's bound wrists, forcing her to squirm to her knees with her head buried in the carpet and her ass in the air. The first blow, which was by far the hardest, caught her full across both ass cheeks, but she screamed louder than the blow deserved. I landed the second swat right below the first. 

When I released her to contort on the floor, I watched the two others who called themselves Jezebels. Mary was aroused. So was Becky, but her arousal was tempered by fear Monica would leave us. 

"Mary," I called. 

"Yes, sir," she whispered. 

"Put your hands behind you so you won't play with yourself," I said. She moaned and complied. I stroked Monica's ass, which was hot from the belt, before pulling her to her knees again. The third stroke was across the middle of her thighs. "Do you want one?" I asked Mary as Monica sobbed and twisted. 

"Not like that," she said. Her eyes were big and round as she grinned and said, "But I'd love ten from your hand." 

"Becky?" I said. 

"I'm a good girl, Jack. I don't need spankings." She looked supportive. "Don't weaken. You need to be demanding with her," she said quietly. 

When I turned back to Monica, she begged, "No more, please, Jack." 

"I'm only getting started," I said firmly, but not cruelly. 

She had five on her ass and three across her thighs before I was through. The spanking probably wasn't as hard as my father gave me when I was a kid, but, hopefully, it was hard enough to let Monica surrender without reservation. She did sob, cry, and beg me to stop throughout her punishment, but I guessed that was as much play-acting as reality. 

When I released her, I asked, "Have I made my point? Do you understand I am the man in your life?" 

"Yes, Jack. Now I need to be fucked," she said hotly. I covered her mouth with my hand. 

"I'm not playing your game. Yes, my cock's so hard it hurts, but you won't enjoy it. You see, Monica, I'm man enough to withstand your manipulation. Mary, did you bring any restraints that can keep her bound safely all night?" 

"Yes, sir," Mary answered. 

"Please, no," Monica whimpered. 

"Go get them. Monica will sleep in here. Becky, open one of the sofa beds," I said. I turned back to my chastised woman. "If you make another sound, I'll gag you." 

Monica quietly complied when I unbound her and told her to get on the sofa-bed. I tied her spread-eagle on her back, leaving some slack to let her move to ease her burning buns. Mary and Becky hovered like protective angels until I asked them to leave. 

"Need anything?" I asked Monica. 

"You." 

"Not tonight. Anything else?" 

"I want to be with you." 

"Think about it tonight and tell me in the morning. Good night, Monica." 

"I love you, Jack," she said in a needy voice. When I leaned down to kiss her, she struggled to raise her lips to mine. The kiss was long and hot. When I pulled away she whimpered, "Please fuck me." I smiled and walked away without replying. 

Becky and Mary were grinning uncontrollably when I got to the bedroom. They both leaped on me and buried me in hugs and kisses. 

"You did it, Jack. You did it," Becky proclaimed. 

They babbled happily as we undressed. "Me first," Mary said as she flopped back on the bed. 

"Mary first," Becky agreed. 

I kissed Becky, who gave me that sexy smile as she pushed me back on the bed. Mary pounced on me, but I flipped her over. She was ready and I was readier. In seconds, she was emitting her patented little "ee, ee" until she exploded like an overloaded steam engine. I felt my legs trembling and a tug on my ball sac. 

"Cum in her, stud," Becky whispered in my ear. 

I didn't need the encouragement. As I came, Mary whispered in my ear, "I love you, Jack." When I collapsed on Mary, four hands caressed me. Then two hands gently pulled me aside. 

Becky grinned. "I like the taste of cum, too," she said. She buried her face between Mary's legs. They rolled over together, which left Mary riding Becky's mouth. Since I liked pussy juice as much as they loved cum, I dove into Becky. Those strong but soft legs slipped over my shoulders and locked behind me. 

The physical is easy to describe - a woman on her back with another woman over her mouth and a man's mouth on her pussy. An oral threesome. The metaphysical is harder to describe. We were a single creature with three organs and three mouths. Or maybe a wave. It felt like an undulating wave. 

"Come on, Becky. I'm almost there. Almost there," Mary whined. 

I could tell Becky was almost there, too. I wrapped my hands over her thighs to ease the pressure on my head, took a deep breath, and dove in for the finale. She came hard, spraying thick juice into my waiting mouth. Mary came at about the same time, bombarding my ears with squeaks caused by someone else. 

I lay back with a woman on each side. Mary wrapped her fingers around my cock. "May I?" she asked. 

"Let him rest," I said. 

With Becky curled up on my left side and Mary on my right, I was asleep in no time. I awakened about two hours later, eased my way out of bed, and used the bathroom. Two of my three Jezebels were sound asleep as I slipped into the living room. 

Monica was as I'd left her. When I untied the restraints, she awakened and smiled at me, but lay perfectly still. I picked her up, carried her to the bedroom, and laid her down on the bed. 

"Your place is with us," I said quietly as to not wake the others. 

"My place is under you," she said, grabbing for my cock. "Please, Jack. Let me show how much I love you." 

This is the way I'd wanted Monica - hot, eager, and ready to take me on a wild ride. Her blue eyes sparkled with sexual need. But it wasn't time. I wrapped my fingers around her wrists, slowly pushed her back, and said, "You show how much you love me by being loving all the time, not by fucking me when you feel like it." I lay down beside her and pulled the covers over us. 

"I know you want me," she whispered. 

"That's obvious, but I'm not going to fuck you now," I replied. "You need to understand that I want all of you and not just the sexual parts." 

"I understand that, Jack," she said, but her eyes told me she wasn't sure she believed it. 

"We'll talk in the morning. Be quiet and go to sleep." 

"Yes, Jack," she said obediently.  

===

She turned her back to me, wiggled her ass to snug my cock between her thighs, and sighed. She was asleep in seconds. I felt breasts against my back and reassuring hands. Becky's arm went over my waist. 

Light was filtering through the drapes when I felt the bed move. I feigned sleep as all three of them arose. I heard whispering and giggling, doors opening and closing. 

"Wake up, sleepy head," Mary said loudly. "Breakfast will be ready shortly." 

When I went into the tiny dining room, breakfast of bacon, eggs, toast, and coffee was ready. We ate and visited before returning to the living room. Again I sat in the straight chair and they sat on the couch, holding hands with Becky in the middle, but this time we all were naked. 

"Jack," Monica began. "Let me answer the questions again. I'll be faithful, whatever definition of that word you choose to give. I'll be obedient, loving, and I'll have your children, and yes, Jack, I very much want to do this. That's a strong yes." 

"That's three unequivocal yeses from us, Jack," Mary said. "What's your answer?" 

I didn't speak because the word caught in my throat. 

"Well, Jack?" Becky said. 

Monica leaned toward me and wrapped her hand over mine. "Please say yes," she mouthed. 

"Yes," I gasped. 

Mary leaped on me with the others right behind her. We ended in a pile on the floor, hugging and kissing and crying. Yes, even I shed a few tears, which, I presume, were for joy. I will say this. While the word yes hurt like hell coming out, it felt damn good now that I'd said it. 

When we'd settled down, I said, "Now what?" 

"We need to set the rules and finances before we finalize our arrangement," Becky said. 

"And the basic rule is that Jack is the mighty pasha and we are his obedient and horny harem girls. Or is it all right to say that you're the husband and we're your wives?" Mary said with a wrinkled nose leer. 

"Tell us the rules," Becky said. 

"Rule one is that you're my obedient and horny wives. Any problems with that?" 

"Not the horny part," Monica said. 

"We like that. What else?" Becky asked. 

"Rule two is communication. Every day, we'll sit and talk. It's more important than sex. We can talk about anything and everything - finances, work problems, children, sex, you name it - but we'll talk, and there won't be any lying." 

"I like that." 

"Me, too," the other two said. 

"What's the third rule?" 

"We'll be faithful, or to put it another way, no cheating. That means no fucking, blowjobs, anal sex, hand-jobs, kissing, touching or being touched, or other physical contact with any male or female outside of the four of us without my express permission." 

"Wow. The old, tight definition." 

"Can we use our vibrators?" 

"Yes, and you can enjoy each other any time," I replied. "What I don't want is a relationship that might pull the four of us apart. That could be any relationship that's sexual." 

"We may need to buy a dog or two," Monica quipped. 

"Are you serious?" I asked. 

"I'd never leave you for a dog," Monica snickered. 

"Or anyone else," I said firmly. Monica was only teasing, but I wanted to make a point and they all understood that. "I'll be faithful, too," I said. 

"Oh, no. We don't want that," Mary exclaimed. 

"No, we don't, Jack," Becky said. 

"Why not?" My surprise was evident. 

"It's psychological, Jack. You're a man, and a man needs to feel that he's free to pursue women," Becky explained. 

"We want to come home at night because you want to come there, not because you feel tied down," Mary said. 

"I like that. It is good psychology," I said. 

"Becky's screwing her boss," Monica said. "Can she continue it?" 

"She told me, and I told her to break it off," I replied. "If this rule becomes too restrictive, let's talk." 

"What do you mean by 'too restrictive'?" Monica asked. 

"I don't want any of you to regret coming home either," I answered. 

"All right. I've got a situation," Monica said. 

"Tell me about it." 

"I'm having sex with one of my customers." 

"Would you lose the sale if you ended it?" 

"No, I wouldn't. It's not like that. He's seventy-two." 

"Mr. Charles," Mary interjected. 

"That's right. His wife died last year after a long illness and I felt sorry for him, so I went to bed with him. Well hell, actually, I seduced him, but that was easy. We don't really fuck that much. It's mostly cuddling." 

"Do you love him?" 

"Yes. Like a father or grandfather." 

"I don't know," I said. "I may have a problem with that. He may be seventy-two, but he's male and single." 

"You're serious about this faithfulness, aren't you?" Mary asked. 

"Yes, I am." 

"You're not going to swap us or give us to your friends?" Monica queried. 

"No." 

"It'll be strange, but I think I can live with it," Monica said. 

"We'll help you, Monica," Becky said solicitously. 

"That'll be the blind leading the blind," Monica quipped. 

"No, it won't. I won't have any problem doing it," Becky replied assuredly. 

"But what about Mr. Charles?" Monica asked. 

"If I give you permission to continue, do I give Mary and Becky permission also? Then is it one man each, or two, or three?" 

"I don't want permission, Jack. I'll be faithful," Becky said firmly. "If I find a man or woman I want, I'll talk to you first and abide by your decision." 

Mary squirmed like a four-year-old in church when I looked at her. "Well, Mary?" 

"I love you, Jack. I'll spend the rest of my life with you. But. . . ." 

"Where is this going, Mary?" 

"If you had a loved one who had an addiction, a horrible addiction worse than heroin or anything, wouldn't you have sympathy for them and want to help them?" 

"Your cocksucking isn't an addiction," Becky said. 

"Yes, it is. I really need to have a cock in my mouth, to feel its hard silkiness, have the thrill as it pumps into me, the taste of that sweetest cream." 

"Oh, for God's sake, Mary, don't you think you're being melodramatic?" Monica said disgustedly. 

"No, I'm not. It's that important." 

"You want permission to suck someone else's cock?" I asked. 

"Well, Jack, two some-ones really." 

"We'll buy you a pacifier," Monica snorted. 

"Oh, great. I get a pacifier and the bitch gets a dog," Mary barked. 

"Mary, be quiet," I said forcefully. She looked properly contrite. Becky had been silent, but her eyes had sent me messages. I appreciated the help. "All right. Monica, you can continue with Mr. Charles, and Mary, you can keep sucking the cocks of those two some-ones. No other exceptions. Understand." 

"Yes, sir," they both replied. 

"Anything else about sex?" I asked. They all agreed we could go to the next subject. "Children. I want to wait a year before we do anything. By then we should know if this is going to work out. If it does, I'd like more children." 

"I'll have them," Mary said brightly. 

"We'll all have them," Becky said. "How many do you want?" 

"I was thinking two each. That would give us nine children." 

"No, Jack," Monica said. I thought she was referring to her comment she only wanted one more, but I was wrong. "If we have nine children and four adults in the house, that's thirteen, and thirteen is an unlucky number." 

"One of us can have three," Mary interjected. 

"We can work that out later. Mary, is Jim paying child support?" She turned beet red. "What's wrong?" 

"Jim had our DNA tested and found out that Jimmy isn't his child. He must be Del's child because I was only fucking the two of them." She shrugged. 

"So Del fathered two of the three?" 

"No, Jack," Monica said with a sigh. "Del didn't father Tiffany. I'm not sure who did." 

"Good," I said. "Then there aren't any other fathers out there. I like it that way." 

"I knew you'd like being a father," Becky said smugly. 

"You're right. I do. I want to be the father of all of them, and that includes Veronica, Tiffany, and Jimmy. Now let's talk about finances." 

Becky said, "Can I tell you where we are?" 

"Go ahead." 

Becky was an accountant and she had organized their finances. She retrieved four copies of their budget from her suitcase while Mary refreshed our coffee. Becky had been preparing the income taxes for all three of them. She had a balance sheet and three years cash flow for each as well as combined. I was surprised at their collective net worth, although much of it was Becky's. She was tight with a dollar. Monica had the highest income since she was in commission sales. 

"What impact is my no cheating rule going to have on your income, Monica?" I asked. 

"None," she said with a grin. "I'm a good salesman, Jack. I don't need to fuck my customers. Mr. Charles is the only one I'm doing." 

Becky had a projected cash flow, including purchasing a new house. She recommended a partnership to own it, since all three of them would be contributing. 

"You haven't included any contribution from me, Becky," I said. 

"I didn't know, Jack." 

"I'll tell you about it later. Have you looked at houses?" 

"I like the old Tabor mansion," Mary said. 

"Me, too, but it's out of our price range," Monica replied. "Anyway, it needs a ton of work." 

"Funny you should mention that house. I was over there last week looking at the place. I like it," I said. "The repairs won't cost as much as you imagine, particularly if we put in some sweat equity." 

We planned and schemed about the Tabor mansion. The place was about sixty years old and on a good sized lot in an older neighborhood. When Mrs. Tabor died, the place was dilapidated with dying shrubbery and zero drive-by appeal. However, it was structurally sound and had a lot of square footage. 

"I'll call my realtor and make a bid," I said. They listened intently as I talked to the realtor who was handling the sale. I made an as-is cash offer with a quick closing, which is the kind estate's like. 

"Jack, we didn't expect this quick time-frame. We don't have the cash," Becky said. 

"Don't worry about the financing," I said. 

"Jack?" Mary said coyly. 

"Yes?" 

"Are you fucking the realtor?" 

"Yes." 

"Is she better in bed than we are?" 

"Never, but she is better than her daughter." 

"Her daughter?" 

"How old is she?" 

"Eighteen. The realtor's forty-one," I replied. 

Suddenly, naked, horny women surrounded me. 

"Come on, Jack." 

"We're going to bed." 

"It's my turn," Monica pronounced as she grabbed my hand. 

I swatted her twitching ass cheek on top of the spot that received the hardest spank. She squealed and jumped in the air. "You better be good," I said as I wagged my finger at her. 

"You better have made your will because I'm going to fuck you to death," she countered saucily. 

Becky lay down on one side of us and Mary on the other. Monica lay back, grabbed my cock, and pulled it toward her pussy. Her expression said this wouldn't be sex; it would be war. I eased into her and we began. Her eyes never closed and the demanding, challenging expression never left her face as she thrust and twisted under me. 

I pulled out and smiled down into those hot and haughty blue eyes. She stilled. Her eyes softened and a tiny, sweet smile appeared below them. 

"Hi, Monica Collins," I said. "I understand you're a woman who needs a man to own her." 

"Not needs. Wants. And not any man. A special man." 

"So, when he comes along, you'll go to him." 

Her eyes twinkled. "No, but if he's the one I want, I'll let him take me." 

"He'd be a lucky man," I said. 

"Yes, he would, but with the right man, I'd be lucky, too." 

"Have you found such a man?" 

"Yes. You." 

"Have I taken you?" 

"Yes, Jack, you have. I'm your little slave girl now," she said lovingly. 

It was a long fuck that started slow and ended hard with her legs around me as I lost myself in her charms. Becky had been right. A properly chastised Monica was a hot and ready woman, one hell of a good fuck who moaned happily when I shot my load in her. When I rolled off Monica, Mary replaced me between Monica's legs to slurp out that which she so dearly loved, and Becky climbed on top of me. She wiggled until my semi-hard cock was buried inside her pussy. 

"I don't want to fuck, Jack. I only want to feel you in me." She giggled. "My God, I haven't told a man that since I was fifteen." 

She said she didn't want to fuck, but she started rotating her pussy on my cock and it was hard again in no time. I let Becky do the work. As I played with her delectable body, I heard Monica orgasm again from Mary's insistent tonguing. 

"I love fucking you, Jack," Becky whispered huskily. She stopped moving and stared down at me with a powerful intensity. "I love you," she said softly. 

"More Mary," Monica groaned. Mary laughed salaciously. 

Becky bounced on me until we came together and she collapsed. 

"Goody. More cum," Mary said. The bed moved. I felt Mary between my legs licking where Becky and I joined. 

Monica squirmed until she was pressed against my side. She kissed me and whispered, "I love you, Jack. We all do." 

"We most definitely do," Mary said contentedly. 

I dozed off with the three of them hot against me. 

***** Sometime later, we were in the kitchen. "Where were we?" I asked. 

"You were telling us about fucking the realtor and her daughter," Monica quipped. 

"We were talking about housing," Becky corrected. "How did you know about this house?" 

"I keep at eye out for old homes that can be fixed up and sold for a profit. I've done three of them so far." 

"Tell us about it, Jack. We haven't seen the inside," Mary said. 

I described the house in detail. It was custom built in the 1920s in Southern Victorian style with a wrap around veranda. It had a partial basement containing about 2000 square feet, two floors of about 3000 square feet each, and an unfinished attic. The bathrooms, electrical, and plumbing would have to be replaced. There wasn't any central air-conditioning. The old garage, which was detached, was beyond repair. The trees were in decent shape, but the shrubs and grass needed replacing. But the place was structurally sound, made of heavy hardwood and without any insect damage. The hardwoods in the floor and certain walls were irreplaceable, and the lot was big. 

As I talked, Monica sketched. She was good and soon we had a working drawing. 

"I'm impressed," I said as I looked at her sketches. "Do you paint?" 

"No. I draw dirty pictures sometimes," she replied with an adorably lecherous leer. 

"How would we do this?" Becky said. 

As we talked about the house plans, hands were on me. The touches weren't sexual. They were loving. I touched them the same way. 

When dinner time came around, I said, "I'm starved. Let's head on out to the restaurant." 

They passed looks among themselves before Mary spoke for them. "Jack, could we eat here?" 

"Why?" 

"We brought a lot of food and we wouldn't have to dress," Mary continued. 

"The truth is we're saving money," Monica said. "Particularly me. I'm a spendthrift, and I've got to save more. I've got to make a home for a child and I need to plan for the future." Her eyes burned into me. "Having another child scares me, Jack." 

"Why?" I asked. 

"Forget about all the time and emotional stress if you can. Do you know how much it costs to raise a child?" 

"My parents raised ten and Mom never worked," I replied. "We kids did." 

"I want Tiffany to have the best," she replied. 

"She will. They all will," I said. I put my arms around her. She put her head on my chest and her arms around my waist. She burrowed there as I stroked her naked back. "It's tough being a single mom, but you're not single anymore. You've got me." 

She looked up at me with soft, sweet, slightly damp, and oh-so-sexy blue eyes. "Oh, Jack," she murmured. 

That's when it hit me. I was as good as married. Marriage! The fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse. Fidelity. Commitment. Marriage. Wife. Oh, shit! I'd really stepped in it! 

"Are you all right, Jack?" Becky asked solicitously. She joined us, wrapping one arm around me and the other around Monica. Mary did the same on the other side. I was glad they were there. They kept me from falling over. 

"I'm fine," I squeaked. "But I need to sit down." 

With their help, I collapsed on one of the dining room chairs. They cooed and clucked around me. One brought me a drink, another some hors d'oeuvres. Reassuring hands were all over me. 

"I'll start the gas grill," Mary said. She disappeared toward the patio and Becky started dinner preparations. 

Monica straddled my legs and stared into my eyes. "Are you sure you want this, Jack? Are you sure you want three women to comfort and console? To love and cherish in sickness and in health?" 

It wasn't my brain that replied. It was my heart, or maybe my cock. "Yes, I'm sure. Completely sure." 

"For how long? Six months? Or until someone better comes along? Or until some rich beauty snares you in her trap? How long, Jack?" 

"Until I die of old age in my own bed surrounded by my three wives and my children and my grandchildren." 

"Thank God," she gasped and clutched me tightly to whisper in my ear. "I need you, Jack. Don't be afraid to make me tow the line. I'm worth it. And no matter what happens, please, oh, please, don't ever leave me." 

"I won't leave you, Monica." I gently pushed her back so I could see her face. "And I am strong enough. Have no doubt about that." 

"I don't." 

We kissed like we'd never kissed. Sweet and tender. Loving. The kind of kisses Mary and Becky gave me. Kisses that said more than I want your cock. Kisses that said I love you. Becky was standing behind Monica. She'd stopped her preparations to watch us. Her face was soft, her eyes passive and tender, and that soft smile was on her lips. 

"I'm slaving over a hot grill and you people are getting off," Mary complained as she bounced into the room. "Are you all right, Jack?" she asked. 

"I've never been better." 

"Want to tell us what happened?" she continued. 

"I felt the bonds of matrimony being snapped around my fragile neck," I said sardonically. I saw their expressions. "Was it that obvious?" I said. 

"Yes, Jack," Mary said as she restrained a laugh. Her face contorted. She snickered, tried to hold it in, and exploded in a gale of laughter. "You should've seen your face, like you'd looked into the face of Death and he smiled at you." 

"I'm glad you're enjoying my pain," I said. 

"You were funny, Jack," Becky said. 

"I'm sorry I started this, Jack," Monica said. "But children need love and attention and money. Gobs of money. It did frighten me. You know that I wasn't playing a game with you, don't you?" 

"I know. It pushed a hot button in me, that's all. Do you live on a budget?" 

"Becky's trying to put me on one, but I'm resisting," Monica replied. 

"Before the weekend's over, I want you to sit down with Becky and draft a budget. I don't want you spending a dime without her knowledge and permission." 

Monica spun around to glare at Becky. "Did you put him up to this?" 

"I didn't. Cross my heart." 

"I'd rather have a collar around my throat than my pocketbook," she retorted. 

"You'll get both," I said. "Mary, how about you?" 

"I'd love a collar." 

"I meant about money." 

"I'm good with money, Jack. I'm not as tight as Becky, but I'm a whole lot tighter than Monica." 

"I've got a combined cash flow based on budgets for the three of us, Jack," Becky said. "I even brought my laptop to make changes." 

"We'll do it after dinner. Right now, I'm starved and cooking steaks is man's work." 

"Everything else is woman's work," Monica quipped. Those blue eyes were teasing, not challenging, me. 

"True," I said, grinning at her. 

The steaks were cooked to perfection, as was everything else. During dinner, we talked about fear. Fear of commitment. Fear of being in a relationship forever. Only Mary didn't admit to those fears. She said that when she met me, she knew I was right for her and her friends. After dinner, I started on the dishes.

"Jack," Becky said. "You've got to let us wait on you." 

"I'll get spoiled," I said. 

"That's the idea," Mary said. 

Monica had a devilish grin when she said, "Fill his belly with good food. Fuck him and suck him until he can't get out of bed. Give him a nice warm home where he's treated like a king. That's the way to tighten the noose." I feigned horror and we all laughed together. 

After the dishes were finished, I said, "Let's watch a movie." We agreed on a romantic comedy, not porn. I propped up in the middle of the bed with Becky on my right, Monica on my left, and Mary between my spread legs leaning back against me. 

After the movie, Becky asked, "Can we discuss the cash flow projections I made based on the budgets?" 

"Why don't you change them to include me," I said. 

"How much would you contribute?" she asked. 

They all three were watching me with baited breath. This was a litmus test of my dedication to the group. I had no idea if their research showed I owned the construction company or the other businesses. I guessed not because I try to hide my resources. 

"All three of you are contributing everything you have into the partnership?" I asked. 

"Yes, we are," Becky said. 

"Every nickel and every dime," Monica added. 

"And Monica's cash flow is the highest?" I asked. 

"Yes, it is," Becky said. 

"I'll match the pot for capital and contribute cash flow equal to Monica's," I said. They all three froze, wide-eyed and open-mouthed. "What?" I asked. 

"Can you afford that?" Becky asked. 

"Yes, I can. Budget for a new van, too. We'll be taking a few trips and we need something reliable." 

"I've never had a new car," she said. 

"You may not this time. We'll have to see what's available." 

"Can I go redo the budget?" 

"Go ahead." Mary and Monica knelt beside me on the bed and their eyes glistened sexually. "You said you wanted to be collared?" I asked Mary. 

"Yes. Can I get it?" I nodded. "Locking or regular?" 

"Does it make any difference?" I asked. 

"It does to me," Monica said. "I feel more secure if it's locked." 

"How much stuff did you bring?" I asked. 

"A lot," Mary said with a grin. 

"Bring it all," I said. 

They did bring a lot. The heavy suitcases were loaded with bondage equipment. Both of them enjoyed B&D, which was going to be a pleasure to explore. They both had two collars, one in soft leather and one in stainless covered by leather that locked behind the neck. I put the locking ones on them, found some wristlets, and applied those for effect. They were the two sexiest little slave girls any man ever had. 

"Come pleasure me," I said as I lay back on the bed. 

We were enjoying ourselves and the ladies were getting ready to mount up when Becky burst into the room. 

"Look at this," she exclaimed. "I know I'm interrupting, but. . . ." 

Becky was staring at the collars around the necks of her two best friends. She looked at me with a deep, questioning gaze, which slowly morphed into that delicious sexy twinkle and Mona Lisa smile. 

"Do you have a collar, Becky?" I asked. 

"I don't own a collar, Jack. If you'll buy me one, I'll wear it." 

"I'll buy it as soon as we get back to town. In the meantime, find something that'll work." 

"My leather one will fit you," Monica said. 

Becky found it and handed it to me. I fastened it around her neck. 

There they were, kneeling on the bed with their collars around their necks, three beautiful, sexy, ladies who belonged to me. 

"How do we look, Jack?" Becky asked very softly. 

"Fabulous," I replied. 

"Do you like us naked and collared?" Monica continued. 

"Our pussies dripping as we await your command?" Mary said. 

"Are you going to like living with a harem of three hot, willing women, Jack?" 

"Yes, I will," I said. 

"That's good, because it's a two-edged sword." 

"You're ours now." 

"We're not letting you get away." 

"Oh?" I asked. 

"Doesn't his collar look good on him?" 

"So do the leathers on his wrists." 

"Now wait a minute," I said. 

"We won't make your restraints too tight." 

"You'll forget you're wearing them in no time." 

"You'll even learn to enjoy them." 

They began to caress and kiss and stroke me. They were right. I didn't feel the restraints, but I knew they were there. They were the same kind any married man feels. They felt perfect on me.
