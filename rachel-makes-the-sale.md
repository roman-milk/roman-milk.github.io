Rachel Makes the Sale

The kiss made my entire body tingle and that was in addition to the absolute surprise of it. I had walked into the lounge intending to have one, at the most two, drinks to take the edge off of the hard day I'd had, get a football card off of the bartender, fill it out, give him five bucks and then leave. I hadn't even seen her sitting at the bar between the two men until she jumped down off the stool and hurried toward me. The surprise was total when she threw her arms around me and kissed me. Then, without a word being said to me she pulled me over to where she had been sitting. 

 "Here's my husband now. Thanks for the drinks. Come on Jim, let's find a table." 

 I stumbled along behind her, absolutely lost and confused. Rachel was married, but she wasn't married to me. In fact, Rachel didn't even like me. 

 Rachel led me to a table and before we could sit down and I could get an explanation the two men came up to the table and without being invited they sat down. One of the men reached a hand across the table to me, "Jim, right? I'm Dan Sommers, maybe Rachel has mentioned me?" 

 I caught a slightly imperceptible nod from Rachel and said, "No, not that I can remember." 

 "I can't say that I'm surprised." He pointed at the other man, "This is Bill Jenks, he's my vice president of sales and marketing." 

 I shook hands with the man while I tried to figure out what was going on. It was obvious that Rachel wanted this Dan guy to believe that I was her husband and she was clearly expecting me to go along with it, but as I shook Bill's hand I was asking myself why I should. 

 Rachel and I worked for the same company. She was in sales and I was in manufacturing. She was on commission and I was salary. I have found that most people in sales and on commission have a tendency to let their mouths overload their asses and then they look to other people to bail them out. Rachel was no exception. 

 A typical conversation would go something like this: 

 "I just sold ABC ten thousand Mark 16B widgets and they have to have them by the first of the month." 

 "Sorry Rachel, the line is set up for the Mark 10As right now. It will be the tenth before I can run the 16Bs." 

 "But the customer will cancel if he doesn't get them by the first." 

 "Sorry, nothing I can do. You get a copy of the production schedule every week so you should know where we are." 

 She would lose the commission and sometimes even lose the customer and she would run to her boss who would go storming in to see mine. I would be called in to the office and I'd have to defend my position. My boss would always say that I was right, but it got old after a while and I started to do little things to stick it to Rachel. Her orders would go to the bottom of the pile and be the last ones filled and other little stuff like that. In short, our relationship was not of the best and yet here she was looking to me to do something for her, and not just any old something either â€“ she wanted me to pretend to be her husband. I was tempted to do what I've heard that Muslims can do; stand up, point at her and say, "I divorce thee, I divorce thee, I divorce thee" and then walk away from her, but at the last second curiosity got the better of me and I decided to play along at least until I could find out what was up. 

 From the way the conversation went it was obvious that Dan and Rachel had known each other in college and it was equally obvious that Dan was an obnoxious asshole. He dropped offhand comment after comment designed to let me, the husband, know that he had been fucking Rachel during their time in college. I just sat there and tried to figure out how Rachel's real husband would respond, but I'd never met the man so I had no frame of reference. I decided that I should handle it as if Rachel was really my wife and I was all set to jump the asshole when Rachel caught my eye and shook her head "no." I settled back into my chair and sipped my drink and listened. 

 Seven o'clock came and the band arrived and began to set up. When they played the first number I figured that I would get Rachel out on the dance floor and ask her what the fuck was going on, but Dan beat me to it. As soon as the first musical note sounded Dan asked Rachel to dance and she looked over at me like a good little wife asking if it was okay and I told her to go ahead. 

 If Rachel had really been my wife and knowing that Dan was an asshole I would have kept a close eye on the two of them, but she wasn't so I didn't. Instead I sat and talked to Bill and that got me part of the story. He and Dan were in town to look at our facilities, at our quality control in particular. They were interested in our Mark 7 AQBs and Rachel was working hard on closing the deal. Suddenly I understood a few things, like why she had pulled me away from the bar and to the table. She wanted to tell me what was going on, but the two men followed too quickly for her to do it. I still didn't understand the husband part, but sooner or later I would get Rachel on the dance floor and find out. 

 But I didn't get the chance. I'd been talking to Bill and I hadn't noticed that Dan and Rachel had stayed out on the dance floor for the entire set. They came back to the table when the band took a break and as soon as they sat down Dan ordered another round of drinks. I was still talking to Bill when I glanced Dan's way and saw him sitting there contemplating me. I went back to my conversation with Bill and a minute or so later I saw that Dan was still sitting there staring at me. I moved in my chair and looked back at him. 

 "Something wrong?" 

 "Maybe. You aren't much of a man are you?" 

 "Would you care to share the thought process that led you to that conclusion?" 

 "Yeah, I think I would. I sat here and pretty much let you know how much I enjoyed your wife while we were in college and you just sat there and ignored me. Then I took her out on the dance floor, played with her tits and her ass and I even ran my hand down inside her skirt and fingered her pussy. I did everything out there except fuck her and you are just sitting there. The obvious conclusion is that you aren't much of a man." 

 I looked at him for a couple of moments and then I turned to Rachel, who was sitting there watching her deal die. 

 "How old are you my love?" 

 "Thirty-one." 

 "Would you say that at thirty-one you can be considered an adult?" 

 "Of course." 

 "An adult capable of handling herself?" 

 "Of course." 

 I turned back toward Dan, "There you have it. Rachel is perfectly capable of handling the situations that she finds herself in. What happened between you and Rachel back in your college days is none of my concern because it happened before I met her. I don't know what she did before me and I haven't told her what I did before I met her." 

 Then I stood up and leaned over the table until my face was about six inches from his and I said, "The only reason I haven't ripped your head off your shoulders and shit down your neck is that Rachel hasn't asked me to. Rachel's tits are hers and if she doesn't mind you playing with them that is her business. Same goes for the rest of the touching. But, she says stop and you don't stop, she tells me and I send you to the emergency room at the nearest hospital. What do you want me to do Rachel?" 

 "Nothing lover. He didn't do anything I didn't let him do." 

 Still six inches from Dan's nose I said, "How about it Dan old buddy, we clear on the rules?" 

 I was ready for almost anything but what I got. Dan leaned back in his chair and burst out laughing. When he got himself under control he said, "Thank God, I was afraid Rachel had married a wimp." 

 By then I had sat back down in my seat and I looked over at him and said, "So what if she had. What business would it have been of yours?" 

 "None at all. Rachel and I had a thing going in school and I wanted to marry her, but she wasn't ready to settle down. When we graduated I asked her again and she said, "Not just yet, let's wait a bit." We drifted apart and later I heard that she married a wimp. It killed me to know that she wouldn't marry me, but would marry some namby-pamby wuss. I'm just relieved to find out that it isn't true." 

 For the next hour Bill and I talked shop while Rachel and Dan played the "Whatever happened to" and "Remember when?" game. Rachel got up to go to the bathroom and I gave her a two minute head start and then I got up and headed for the rest rooms meaning to intercept Rachel on her way back to the table and find out just what the hell was going on. 

 On the way I saw Jack the bartender wave at me and I remembered why I had come into the bar. I got my football card from him and was filling it out when Rachel came out of the ladies room and headed for the table. I filled the card out and gave Jack five bucks and then I went and used the men's room. I took my whiz and while I shook the last drops off I debated just walking out of the john and going home. The idea had a certain appeal to it, but in the end curiosity won out. I just had to find out what Rachel was up to. 

 When I got back to the table Rachel said, "Dan has invited us up to his room lover. I told him we could stay for a while. Okay with you?" 

 At that point I was going to say no? 

 "Whatever you want sweetie." 

 "What ever I want?" 

 I was flying blind and with no script telling me what was going on and what I was supposed to do so I took my cue from the tone of Rachel's voice and said, "When have I ever denied you anything baby?" 

 Rachel smiled at me and then stood up, "Shall we go?" 

 During the ride up in the elevator I saw Rachel looking at me with a bemused smile on her face. I really, really wanted to get her alone and ask some questions, but it looked as if I was never going to get a chance. 

 Dan's room was actually one of the hotels hospitality suites and it came with a well-stocked wet bar. As Dan and I stood at the bar building drinks I heard Dan chuckle and then say, "I hoped that you hadn't changed any." 

 I turned to see Rachel unsnap her bra and step out of her skirt. She stood there in nylons, high heels and garter belt and looked at the three men in the room and then she said, "Who goes first?" 

 Dan laughed again and then said, "Since your hubby and I have already had the pleasure why not take Bill first?" 

 Rachel smiled, looked at me and said, "That okay with you lover?" 

 At that point what could I say? I just shrugged and said, "Go for it Rachel." 

 Rachel smiled, stepped over to Bill and her hands went to his belt buckle, "Here baby, let me help you with that." 

 For the next three hours Rachel fucked and sucked the three of us until she could not get any of us up anymore. At first I just stood there and watched as she sucked on Bills cock and then swung over him and fucked him. When he finished and she got off of him she looked over at Dan and me and raised an eyebrow as if to say, "Next?" Dan looked at me and said, "You mind? You get her all the time and I haven't had her in ten years." 

 I waved toward the bed and said, "Be my guest." 

 While watching her suck Dan's cock I decided that fucking Rachel was just too good an opportunity to pass up and I stripped. I walked over to the bed and waved my cock in Rachel's general direction and she smiled, bent forward and took me in her mouth. 

 Rachel took us in all three of her holes and once she had all three of us in her. She had the tightest ass and pussy I'd ever been in and I started wondering how I could work it to spend more time in her. When it was all over and everyone was dressing Dan said, "When can we do this again?" 

 "That depends on you" Rachel said. 

 "How's that?" 

 "You buying your Mark 7 AQBs from me.' 

 "I buy from you and we get to do this again?" 

 "As often as you are in town, providing of course that you don't move here." 

 Dan turned to me, "You okay with this?" 

 "I already told you, Rachel does what she wants. I only get involved when she asks me to." 

 "Pardon me for saying this, but that just ain't natural." 

 I smiled at him. "She just fucked the three of us to a standstill. Can you imagine what she would do to me and my health if I had to try and keep her satisfied on my own?" 

 Dan laughed, "You got a point there. Okay Rachel, you get all my business from now on and I'll give you advance notice now that I'll be back in town in two weeks." 

 As we rode the elevator down to the lobby I asked Rachel if she was going to tell me what it was all about. 

 "No. You only need to know that if you keep your mouth shut about tonight it will very likely happen again the next time I need a husband." 

 "What about your real husband?" 

 "Harold? I'm afraid that Dan heard right when he heard that I married a wimp. I do love the cuddly old bear, but Harold just wouldn't understand any of this." 

 "And I do?" 

 "You don't have to. After all, you aren't my husband." 

 The rest of the ride was in silence, but as we crossed the lobby Rachel said, "Be sure to keep your calendar clear for week after next." 

 "Why?" 

 "Have you forgotten already? Dan will be back in two weeks and I did promise him we would see him every time he came to town. Good night hubby dear" and she headed for the parking lot and her car. 

 Rachel's orders go to the top of the pile now and I'm marking the days off my calendar until Dan gets back to town and I get to be Rachel's husband again. Report_Story
