Abby's Plan
===========
#1 

 

 

===

We weren't the first couple to find ourselves in the situation. Fifteen years married and the passion was lacking. The affection was there and the love making was a little off - down from three or four times a week to twice and usually on Tuesday and Friday - but we were happy together. At least we were until she got her sister involved. 

 I never did find out how Abby and her sister Jane got on the subject, but one evening Abby said to me: 

 "Where did the fierce passion go Rob? It used to be that we couldn't keep our hands off of each other. Our love making was spontaneous and never on a set schedule. I remember times when you would pull the car over and have me on the back seat on the way home from the grocery store. Remember your dad's birthday party? The one where you pulled me out into the garage and did me on the hood of his car? What happened to us Rob?" 

 "I guess we grew up Abby. I guess we finally realized what the consequences would be if we were caught on the back seat on the side of the road or the embarrassment we would have caused all concern if someone had come out into the garage and seen us. What happened Abby is that life got in the way and made us grow up." 

 "Are you saying that you are satisfied with the way things are?" 

 "If the question is "Am I satisfied with my life" the answer is a most definite yes. If the question is "Would I like a hotter sex life" then the answer to that is also a yes, but how do we do it Abby? Stop and think about why we are where we are. We started out young and carefree, but as time went on there were promotions at work; jobs that required more time, harder work and more responsibility. How many times did you come home from work to find me hot and ready to go only to hear you say: 

 "Oh God baby, not tonight. I need to go soak in the tub." 

 "How many times did I come home to find you horny as hell and have to tell that I couldn't because I was just to beat? It hasn't changed any Abs. Since making Division Manager you are putting in sixty or more hours a week and on any given night I can expect to get a phone call from you telling me that you will be working late. And that is if I'm here to take the call. Since my becoming a Regional Manager my hours are as stupidly long as yours. With our schedules we are lucky to get the twice a week that we do get." 

 "Well honey, I'm not satisfied with things the way they are and I want to do something about it. Jane says that there are a lot of things we can do to put some spark back in our love life." 

 "Jane says? You are taking relationship advice from a woman who is on her fourth husband? The same Jane who was named as a correspondent in three different divorce cases?" 

 "At least none of her problems were sexual." 

 I had to laugh at that. "Abs, all of her problems are sexual. She is having sex with another man and her husband finds out or the wife of the man she was screwing finds out." 

 "Rob, you stop that right now. We agreed not to talk about Jane and what she does with her life. All I meant when I said none of her problems were sexual is that she has a healthy attitude when it comes to sex and I trust Jane to know about sexual sparks. She told me several things we can do, that I can do, but I guess most of what she said can be boiled down to never saying no." 

 "What the hell does that mean?" 

 "Just what it says; never say no. If we are driving down the street and I tell you to pull over and get in the back seat you don't say no. If we are at a movie and you put your hand on my leg and start working your way up I don't push your hand away and say, "No rob, not here." If you are in the mood and I'm not I don't say no, but give you the chance to work me into the mood." 

 "So if I want to make love to you on a picnic table in the park at high noon you won't say no?" 

 "If that is what you really want to do. We might go to jail, but we will go together. It is a trust thing baby. I have to trust you not to do anything that might hurt us and you will have to trust me to do the same. Bottom line is that we are the ones who let things go stale so we are the ones who have to put the spark back. It isn't a case of finding the time to do things; it is a case of making the time." 

 "So did Jane give you a game plan?" 

 "She just told me to stop whining and do something about it." 

 She stood up and said, "Let's go. I'm going to take you up to the bedroom and suck your dick so hard that your ears will be pulled inside your head and then we will go from there." 

 It was a long and very enjoyable evening for me and the blow job and furious romp in the morning started my day off just right. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That night something came up at work and I called home and told Abby not to hold dinner for me. When I did get home around nine I found Abby waiting for me in nothing but a pair of high heels. She had a drink in her hand and she handed it to me and said: 

 "Here lover, sip this to help you relax while I see to it that a certain part of your body doesn't get too relaxed." 

 She went to her knees in front of me and reached for my zipper. It was the first time I'd been blown just inside my front door; the first time I took my wife on the stairs just inside the front door and the first time I'd made love to a naked lady while I was still fully dressed. Abby waited until it was over before telling me how it felt when the hairs of her pussy kept getting caught in my zipper. 

 The next morning she woke me with a blow job and when I reached for her she laughed and got off the bed and told me that the blow job was just a preview for what I would get that night. 

 Abby made sure that things got lively in our bedroom. I did my part. I took her out for dinner and dancing on Saturday and when we left the lounge I drove out to the place that was the local 'lover's lane' when we were dating. We did some serious making out before I told her to move to the back seat. 

 "I don't know Rob; we haven't been here in years and years and who knows what the cops are like now." 

 "Wasn't it you who told me about never saying no? About how it didn't matter if we went to jail so long as it was together?" 

 She grinned and crawled over the seat into the back. She sat next to me on the drive home and played with my cock the whole way. Once in the house it was straight to the bedroom for one more romp before falling asleep in each other's arms. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Over the next month we made love in the Wal-Mart parking lot; Abby blew me as we went through an automatic car wash and I took her dog fashion in the reference section of the local library. The closest we came to having a problem was at one of the local theatres. We were in the back row and Abby was sitting on my lap with my cock well up in her when a man came down the aisle from the other end and sat down beside me. He leaned to me and whispered: 

 "This is a respectable place and I don't really want to call the cops, but I will if necessary." 

 He got up and left us alone and Abby quickly got up off my lap. Abby wanted to get up and leave, but I made her stay and watch the rest of the film. 

 The theatre episode fueled Abby's imagination and she talked me into taking her to an adult theatre to see some x-rated films. The Bluebird was having a nostalgia special, "Deep Throat" and "Behind the Green Door" so on Saturday night I took her to see it. We were five minutes into "Deep Throat" when Abby reached over, unzipped me and took out my cock. I glanced quickly around, but no one seemed to notice as Abby's head went down and took me in her mouth. 

 Abby gives great head and as she sucked on me I looked around and saw some of the action going on. We were on the rear row of the center section and I could see a couple over in the right section doing what Abby and I had done in the other theatre. Three rows down from us I could see a woman's arm moving as she jacked off the guy sitting next to her and five rows down and in the left section I saw two guys who seemed to be working on each other. 

 I was leaning back, eyes closed and enjoying the hell out of what Abby was doing to me when I heard a noise in front of us. I opened my eyes and saw two guys move in front of us and sit down. They turned to watch what Abby was doing and she noticed them and pulled off my cock and sat up and when she did they turned and faced the movie screen. 

 Abby waited a couple of minutes and then she took off her panties, got up from her seat and sat down on my cock facing the movie. She moaned as I slid into her and started fucking her and the two guys turned around to watch. They watched as Abby bounced up and down on me and I heard her moan: 

 "Oh God baby, they're watching me. I'm being watched fucking you baby; so fucking hot." 

 I couldn't see her face but the guys in front of me could. I don't know what they saw or thought they saw, but one of them stood up and took out his cock and leaned forward to push it at Abby's face. I put my arms around her and pulled her back tight against me and snarled at the asshole to sit his ass back down. The mood was broken and Abby got off me and a minute later she said she wanted to leave. On the ride home she said: 

 "I was just getting into it. It was such a kick to be watched. Why did that guy have to go and ruin it?" 

 I didn't have a clue as to how to answer that and Abby said, "Hurry up and get us home baby. I need to finish what we started." 

 It ended up being a pretty exhausting night for me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was the middle of the week following the adult movie fiasco when Abby said: 

 "Jane said something else we could try would be role playing." 

 "How?" 

 "Maybe after we go out for dinner you could drop me off at the front door of a lounge, go park the car and then come in and pretend you are picking me up." 

 We tried it and it seemed to go okay. Abby got turned on by it and she told me about the guy who hit on her before I got there and then she went after my cock like a starving woman. The following Friday night we did it again only that time she asked me to give her a fifteen minute head start. 

 "I want to see if I can draw a couple of guys that you will have to separate me from." 

 I gave her the fifteen minutes and when I walked in she was sitting at the bar with three guys standing around her. I watched for about five minutes and when one of the three left to go to the john I walked over and said: 

 "Hi. I'm Rob and you look like a lady who needs to be rescued. Join me at a table?" 

 One of the guys looked like he was going to take exception to my butting in, but before he could say anything Abby said: 

 "I like take charge guys. Sure, why not." 

 She got off her stool and we moved to a table. We talked, had a few drinks and danced and then I had to go to the bathroom. When I came back she was out on the dance floor with one of the guys who had been with her at the bar. The song ended and she headed back for our table. The band started the next number and before she could get to the table one of the other guys from the bar intercepted her and led her back out onto the dance floor. She ended up dancing with all three of them before returning to the table. As Abby sat down she said: 

 They want me to go with them to a party." 

 I didn't say anything and she said, "I told Ben, he's the last one I danced with, that I'm sticking with you because of the size of the lump you keep poking into my leg. He told me that if size was my thing he had nine and a half inches. I laughed and told him that all the guys say that and he offered to show it to me the next time you go to the bathroom." 

 "I'll just have to make sure that I won't have to go to the bathroom before we get home." 

 "Oh come on honey; this may be my only chance to see one that big." 

 "This is role play Abby; where we pretend, remember? Pretend I have ten inches." 

 "Spoil sport. You probably won't let me go party with them either." 

 "Good bet Abby." 

 "You're no fun." 

 "You want to pull a train Abby? That's what they have planned for you if you go." 

 "Oh my, wouldn't that be kinky. Would you join in or just watch?" 

 "We will never know Abby because we won't be there." 

 She pretended to be pissed and then said, "Oh well, lets get out of here then so I can check out this ten inches you say you have." 

 To get a good blow job while you are driving down the road you need to push the seat all the way back as far as it will go. Sometimes that makes it hard to reach the pedals, but I managed to get us home safe. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next weekend on Friday night Abby asked for a thirty minute head start and I told her that I didn't think that was such a good idea; that I wasn't comfortable with the way I had to separate her from the three guys the previous time. 

 "But that's what makes it so good for me honey. Seeing you see how desirable I am to these other guys and then letting you take me away from them and then take me home and fuck my brains out." 

 She kept after me until I caved and then I laughingly told her, "No going out to the parking lot to check out dick sizes." 

 "Oh pooh! There you go again being a party pooper." 

 I gave her a thirty minute head start and I was not pleased with the result. I walked into the lounge and saw her out on the dance floor with some guy and they were dancing close and the guy had his hand on her ass. What really torqued me was that she made no move to push it away. I took a seat at the bar and watched to see where she would sit when the music stopped. 

 The song ended and she walked with her dance partner to a table and sat down with him. I wondered how I was supposed to move in on her in that sort of situation and make it seem natural, but I couldn't come up with anything. Trying to cut in on the dance floor would probably get me a "Fuck off buddy" and cause a scene so I decided to wait and see what Abby might do to give me an opening. Half an hour went by and Abby danced three more dances with the guy and each time she allowed his hands to go wherever he wanted to put them and at no time did she ever look my way. 

 "Time to end this shit" I thought as I got up and headed for the table where the two of them were sitting. I walked up and then sat down on one of the two empty chairs at the table. I smiled at Abby and said: 

 "How's it going Abs? Looking good as always." 

 I turned to the guy and offered my hand for a shake. "Rob Turner. I used to date Abbey." He didn't know what to do so he took my hand and as we shook he said, "Jim. Jim Stanton." 

 "Pleased to meet you Jim. Hey, I don't mean to intrude on you two, but I have what you might call a social obligation here. Like I said, I used to date Abby. The key words here are "used to." The reason that I stopped dating her is that she gave me the clap. I just thought you should know. You all have a good time now." 

 I got up and returned to my seat at the bar and watched as the two of them talked and I could tell from the facial expressions that it wasn't "sweet talk." After a minute or so Jim stood up, threw a couple of bills down on the table and walked away. Abby looked around and spotted me and I raised my glass in 'salute' and then finished my drink and headed for the car. 

 I was sitting in the car when Abby came out of the lounge and I flashed the lights a couple of times so she could see where I was parked. She was steamed when she got into the car. 

 "How could you do that to me? Have you any idea how much you embarrassed me?" 

 "Pretty good idea, but then you had it coming." 

 "Why in the world would you say something like that?" 

 "You were supposed to go in there and take a seat at the bar and put yourself in a position where I could move in on you. No way to do that when you settled in at a table with one guy and then just stayed there. I had limited options and I was pissed with you for what you were letting him do with his hands without even making a token effort to stop him. I think I handled it pretty well. No direct confrontation with the guy, but I got you separated." 

 "Who knows what he will tell and who he will tell it to. I won't ever be able to go back in there again." 

 "Oh well, too bad, but I guess it was my fault that things turned out the way they did. I knew that giving you a thirty minute head start wasn't a good idea, but I let you do it anyway." 

 She said nothing and for the first time since we started these little weekend role playing things Abby did not slide across the seat and sit next to me. When we got home she went straight to bed, pulled the covers over her head and ignored me when I got into bed next to her. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Saturday I had a golf date. We had a ten o'clock tee time and I left the house at nine-fifteen intending to stop on the way to the golf course and get gas and some coffee and donuts on the way. I was a block from the house when the right front tire went flat. I opened the trunk and found that the spare wasn't there and then I remembered loaning it to one of the guys I worked with. We got off work one night and when we got to the parking lot we noticed that he had a flat. He opened his trunk and found that his spare was flat also and since our tires and wheels were the same size I loaned him my spare Abby's car had the same size tire and wheel so I walked back to the house to get her spare. 

 I went in the front door and was just about to call out for Abby and tell her I needed her keys when I heard her on the telephone in the kitchen. 

 "--------hand on my ass and Rob was watching. I was hot enough to fuck and Jim thought he was on his way to getting some." 

 I didn't like the sound of that so I didn't move and just stood there and listened. 

 "No, but he did get his hand half way up my leg while we were sitting at the table." 

 "Well, maybe a little." 

 "No. Rob managed to fuck it up for me. I have his phone number, but calling him now won't do any good after the shit Rob pulled." 

 "I've done everything you have suggested Sis, but Rob just won't loosen up." 

 "No Sis, not at all." 

 "No Jane, I'm just going to have to accept that he is a stick in the mud and work around it. He is never going to loosen up and be the man I need him to be." 

 "Of course I love him. Why else would I be trying so hard to move him to a point where we can do it together? The problem is that he is just too straight." 

 "Oh yeah. I'm not going to stop. If he doesn't come on board I'm still going to do it alone." 

 "You think?" 

 "Okay then, I'll try that this weekend. I'll get with you later on the timing. "(giggle, giggle, giggle) and won't that be a kick." 

 I backed quietly out of the house and closed the door. I used my cell to call Chuck and tell him that I would have to cancel and then I made a lot of noise opening the front door and going into the house. "Abby?" I called out as I walked in. "In the kitchen honey." As I walked into the kitchen she was saying, "Got to go Jane. Talk to you later." 

 When she hung up the phone I told her what had happened and told her that I needed the keys to her car so I could get her spare. 

 "Sorry honey, but I had a flat day before yesterday and my spare is on the left rear of the car. The other tire is at the Goodyear place and I told them I would pick it up Monday. Why don't you call Triple A? We've belonged for years so it's about time we used them." 

 If I hadn't already overheard her half of the conversation with Jane and become suspicious what she had just told me would have had alarm bells ringing loud and clear. Anything, and I do mean anything, that went wrong with Abby's car was reported to me immediately. I heard about every squeak and rattle -real or imagined - and was expected to look into it. She even came to me with stuff like:

"I think the interior light is going bad. When I open the door the light looks dimmer." 

 If Abby had a flat I would have heard about it as soon as it happened. For some reason Abby did not want me looking in the trunk of her car. I could have verified that easy enough by saying, "No need to call Triple A. We will just throw my flat in the trunk of your car and take it over to the Texaco station." But I didn't want to push things until I knew more. 

 I called Triple A and they said it would be about thirty minutes so I grabbed a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table and sipped it while I waited. As I sipped I thought about what I needed to do. Something smelled rotten her and I was going to find out what it was. 

 I had a set of keys for Abby's car somewhere in my desk and after Triple A had gone I went looking for them. I dug through my desk drawers until I found them and then waited for what I knew would come. At two Abby asked what I wanted for dinner and I told her that I thought that we would go out for dinner. 

 Knowing Abby as well as I did I knew what telling her that we would eat out would do. Sure enough, around four, Abby told me that she was going to shower and get ready to go out. As soon as I heard the shower running I hurried out to the garage and opened up the trunk of Abby's car. Sure enough the spare was there and so was an overnight bag. I opened it and found two pairs of high heels, several pairs of nylons and a garter belt. There was also some Astroglide, nine condoms and some frilly under things that I had never seen before including a pearl thong. 

 It appeared that Abby had a secret life. Well, it wasn't going to stay secret much longer. I put everything back the way I found it and went back into the house. 

 Abby was still in the shower as I stepped up to the bathroom sink to shave and as I looked at myself in the mirror I considered what I had found out. From the phone conversation I gathered that Abby was running around on me ("I have his phone number, but calling him won't do any good now"). Also from the phone conversation it appeared that whatever she was doing she wanted me to get in on it. 

 If she was playing around it could only be at certain times. It had to be during the day when she was at work - perhaps long lunches - or on the nights she said she was working late. The only other possibility was on Saturday when she had a standing appointment at Audrey's Hair and Nail Salon. As a betting man I would go for Saturday and the nights she worked late and I would make it my immediate priority to find out. 

 After dinner and on the way home Abby slid over next to me and started rubbing my cock through my pants. She suggested that I find a nice dark side street where we could park and play on the back seat. I debated, based on what I suspected, on finding some reason not to have sex with Abby, but I reasoned that 

 (a) It wouldn't be a normal response from me and that might make 

 her wonder if maybe I was having thoughts she would rather I 

 didn't have and it might make her more cautious and 

 (b) If she had picked something up in her travels it had probably 

 already been passed to me so there wasn't any real reason to 

 be careful at that point. 

 But I did make a mental note to make an appointment to be checked out. 

 I did find a dark side street and we did climb in back. I did give Abby an orgasm and I did cum, but I can't say that I got any real pleasure out of it. My heart wasn't in it and I was pretty much just going through the motions. We had sex once more when we got home and then I fell into a troubled sleep. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday at lunch time and armed with some information I got from the guy who does our IT work I went to Radio Shack and purchased a voice activated tape recorder, an external microphone and a pair of small alligator clips. I left work early and went home so I could do what needed to be done before Abby got home. 

 I plugged the external mike into the recorder and then cut the microphone off. I attached the alligator clips to the two microphone wires and then took the unit down to the basement. I found where the telephone wire came into the house and then slit into the outer casing and found the two colored wires that Sam had told me to look for. I stripped the insulation back on those two wires and attached the alligator clips to the bare wire. If it worked, and Sam assured me that it would, I would have a phone tap that recorded everything that went over that phone line. 

 I got back upstairs just in time to hear the phone ring and the answering machine pick up the call. 

 "Hi honey. Working late tonight. Should be home around nine or so. Love you. Bye." 

 I went back down into the basement and checked the recorder and found out that Sam was right - it had worked like a charm. I fixed myself some dinner and then went looking for the instruction manual for the answering machine. I had never used it, but if memory served me it had a remote call in feature that would allow me to call home, enter a code and hear any messages that were on the machine. I found the manual and wrote down the code and procedure and put it in my wallet and then watched TV until ten to nine. I was in no mood to face Abby so I went to bed and pretended to be asleep when she came to bed. 

 In the morning while Abby was taking her shower to get ready for work I checked out the trunk of her car. Her overnight bag contained three fewer condoms and that pretty much erased all doubt that I might have had about what my wife was doing. I wasn't sure that I could face Abby that morning and not give away what I was thinking so I got out of the house and headed for work while she was still in the shower. 

 Starting at four I called home every fifteen minutes and used the remote feature to check for messages. None from Abby, but that wasn't really a surprise since she had never, at least that I could remember, worked two late nights in a row. At five I called home and left a message that I would be working late. I didn't really have anything to do, but I didn't want to go home and spend an evening with Abby pretending that everything was just hunky-dory. 

 Instead, I went to Maury's and sat at the bar nursing a vodka tonic while I tried to think of what could have happened to turn my wife into a cheating slut. For the life of me I couldn't think of a thing. I hadn't noticed any lack of love or affection over the last few years (and I was making the assumption that her cheating was a recent development) and our life together had been, or seemed to have been very good. No arguments or fights over anything. I thought maybe it could have been the frequency of sex, but that didn't make much sense. All Abby had to do was mention it and it would have changed. After all, wasn't that what had happened over the last couple of months. 

 Then I had to think about the other part -- what was I going to do? I loved her and had from the first day I met her, but I couldn't think of any set of circumstances that would allow me to accept her infidelity. I just wasn't made that way. She was mine or she wasn't. There was no in between. 

 I stalled until I thought she would be in bed and asleep before I went home. She was in bed and she was asleep when I got in bed, but as soon as I laid back she rolled over and snuggled in next to me. I suffered through another night of troubled sleep. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 In the morning while Abby showered I went down to the basement and check the recorder. I figured that Abby would talk to Jane since I wasn't home last night and I wasn't wrong. 

 "Hi Sis." 

 "Hello yourself you slut." 

 "Is that anyway to talk to your little sister?" 

 "The truth is the truth Abs. So what do you think of Troy?" 

 "What do you expect me to say, that I didn't like it? Hell Janie, you watched. How do you think I liked it?" 

 "Why do you think I called you a slut? If I had taped it we could have made some serious bucks selling it. I've seen professional porn that wasn't as hot. He wants to know when he can see you again." 

 "Why? Did he like my ass that much?" 

 "I don't know about him, but you sure went nuts over it. Does Rob do much anal with you?" 

 "Oh God no. He's never done my ass." 

 "He think it's disgusting?" 

 "No, it was me who thought it was disgusting. I've been telling Rob no for years." 

 "You sure didn't think it was disgusting last night." 

 "I didn't know what he was doing until he was in me. I guess I kind of got into it huh?" 

 "Did you ever. You going to let Rob try it now?" 

 "Hell no! The last thing I need is for him to start wondering why after all these years I want him to fuck my ass. If I get him on board with what I'm doing I'll give all of it he wants." 

 "Then you better make sure that if he gets on board that you never let him see someone else do you there before he does. If he finds out you have been giving other guys what you won't give him it won't be pretty. You going to let Chuck have it on Saturday?" 

 "If he wants it." 

 "Oh he will. He loves going up the Hershey Highway. What should I tell Troy?" 

 "How about Thursday night?" 

 "I'll tell him. What's the latest on your plan to get Rob to watch you do another guy?" 

 "Not making much progress there. Given the way he reacted last weekend I'm beginning to doubt that I can make it happen." 

 "You still going to try the adult book store thing?" 

 "Yeah. I love Rob and want him to be on board with me so I have to keep trying." 

 "Well slut sister; let me know when so I can set it up for you. Someone is at the door so I'll have to let you go. See you Thursday if I don't talk to you before." 

 "Okay Janie. Love you, bye." 

 Well, there it was. Not only confirmation that she was a cheating whore, but the answer to the questions of when and where. All that was left for me to do was put and end to it. If there had been even the slightest chance of the marriage surviving and I was honest enough with myself to admit that there wasn't, it would have been crushed by the anal sex thing. I had tried for years just to try it once. I might not have even liked it, but I did want to try it at least once, but I was always met with distain and even outright disgust. But not only could this Troy guy have it, he could even have more of it if he wanted and some shithead named Chuck could have it too if he wanted it. This from a bitch who said she loved me! 

 I hurried upstairs so I could get out of the house before Abby came down from dressing for work. If ever there was a good time for avoiding the wife that was the time. Nothing good would come out of my speaking to Abby while in the mood I was in right then. 

 I spent the drive to work making mental lists of what I was going to have to do. First thing would be to see an attorney to get some advice and to set things in motion. There wasn't a lot else that needed to be done. Abby owned the house. It had been left to Jane and her when her parents died and she had bought out Jane. It was a no fault state so basically it would be an even split. Our incomes were comparable so there wouldn't be any alimony. The only arguments would be over who got what out of the household furnishings and things like that. I would take a "possession is nine tenths of the law" stance on that and get what I wanted before the papers were served. The hard part was going to be living with Abby and pretending that everything was all right. To be honest; I wasn't at all sure that I could do that, but I would have to try. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I got out the Yellow Pages and found a divorce attorney close to work and called for an appointment. He had an opening on Wednesday afternoon and I told his receptionist that I would take it. Then I sat at my desk and made a list of what I wanted out of the house. It turned out to be surprisingly little. My clothes, desk and desk chair and computer from my den and my tools and things in the garage. With someone to help me move the desk I could have it all out of the house in an hour. 

 The list of things to do was just as short. Handle the credit cards, checking and savings accounts and having my name removed from the gas, electric and phone accounts. I would need to change the beneficiary on my insurance and get change of address cards out to everyone I could think of. 

 I used the 'working late' excuse to avoid Abby that night, but she was waiting up for me when I got home and she wanted to make love. To have said no would have been out of character so I fucked her. I didn't make love to her, I fucked her. I treated her like anyone of the bar pickups I'd had before we got married. It seemed to be good enough for her and when I came I rolled over and pretended to go to sleep. 

 In the morning I checked the recorder but there was nothing of interest on it. My appointment with the lawyer went pretty much as expected. Everything would be split fifty/fifty and the house was exempt although I could try and recover what ever I had put into the house, but he advised against it saying that it would just complicate what could be a quick divorce. He went on and covered the various scenarios that could take place if Abby contested the divorce. I told him that it was highly unlikely that she would and then he suggested filing under irreconcilable differences because that filing, uncontested, would shoot through the courts and things would be over in a matter of months. A contested filing would take longer as would a filing of infidelity contested or uncontested. I told him to go ahead and do the paperwork for irreconcilable differences and then call me when they were ready to be served. 

 When I got back to the office I called home and used the remote feature to check for messages and there were none from Abby telling me that she would be working late. I had to go home since it would not have been normal for me to work too many late nights. Either Abby had gotten enough the night before or she was saving up for Troy the next day because she made no move to have sex that night and I didn't go after her on my own. 

 Thursday morning I checked the recorder, but all that was there was a short call from Jane telling Abby that Troy would be there when she got there Thursday evening. At four Thursday afternoon I checked the answering machine and at four-thirty there was one from Abby telling me that she would be working late. At five-twenty I was parked where I could see Jane's front door and at five thirty-five I watched as Abby pulled up, parked and then got her overnight case out of her trunk and then she went inside Jane's place. 

 I didn't really need to be there since I knew from the recorder what was going on, but I'm the kind of guy who likes to make sure he has his facts straight, his 'eyes' dotted and his 'tees' crossed and so the need for visual confirmation. As the door closed behind Abby I started the car and headed for home. 

 I was in bed when Abby got home and I just mumbled and lay there when she shook me and asked: 

 "Are you awake baby? I'm horny honey; are you awake?" 

 I pretended to be asleep and finally she got undressed and got in bed and snuggled up to me. I laid there wondering if she got a charge out of coming home and giving me used pussy. 

 Abby woke me with a blow job the next morning and when she had me hard enough she climbed on and rode me while I tried hard not to think of the fact that just twelve hours earlier someone else had been in her faithless, cheating cunt. I decided that the only way I was going to be able to make it until I hit Abby with the divorce papers was to just think of her as nothing but a cum receptacle - a place to dump my juices. 

 I called home and left a message that I would be late, but Abby was waiting for me when I got home and she wanted to fuck. We fucked twice and then on Saturday she left the house to go to her standing appointment at the beauty parlor. I wondered if she went before or after she went to Jane's. Did she get herself beautiful for Chuck (or whomever) or did she get herself all dolled up after she fucked. 

 As soon as she was gone I went down to the basement and checked the recorder. I knew she would have talked to Jane the previous evening since I didn't come home until late. 

 "Hi Sis." 

 "Hi yourself you sexy bitch." 

 "Hey Sis, all I was doing was following your lead." 

 "Tomorrow night still on?" 

 "Unless for some reason Rob says no." 

 "Why would he do that?" 

 "He's probably still pissed over what happened last weekend." 

 "He hasn't said anything, has he?" 

 "No, but I know him and I know he hasn't forgotten it." 

 "In that case how are you going to work it?" 

 "Just tell him that I want to go out for dinner and then drinks and dancing after. He will probably balk, but I'll tell him that I don't want to play pretend like the last couple of times. Just him and me and no games and he will probably go along with it." 

 "Okay. Call me just before you leave the club and I'll call Mike, Chuck and Paul and let them know. Remember, the next to last booth on the left. Chuck will be in the end booth and Mike in the next booth to make sure that it is available for you when you get there. Paul will be in the aisles talking to Mike on his cell and he will let him know when you walk in. Mike will then leave the booth so you can have it. Chuck is going nuts over the fact that you might be able to play with his cock while Rob watches. What do you think Rob will do?" 

 "No idea, but there are only two choices, right? He either lets me or he doesn't. If he let's me I'm one step closer to having him do what I want." 

 "Okay sister slut, let's hope for the best. Can you get loose Monday or Tuesday? Troy and Mike want to double team you again." 

 "How about Paul? You going to let me have him so I can try three at once?" 

 "If you want Abs. I'm sure that he will go along. He couldn't take his eyes off you last night when you took on Troy and Mike." 

 "Have you thought anymore about the gangbang? I really do want to try at least one." 

 "Give me a number Abs." 

 "How about six?" 

 "Tell me when." 

 "Let's see how tomorrow night goes with Rob." 

 "Any thoughts to the next step?" 

 "If tomorrow goes all right I'll do it the next weekend." 

 "Isn't that a little quick? Shouldn't you spend a little more time softening Rob up?" 

 "I really don't have all that much more time Janie. Rob isn't stupid. Sooner or later he is bound to figure out what is going on. If I'm to have any chance at all of hanging on to him it has to be by getting him involved before he finds out on his own." 

 "You could always stop what you are doing Abs." 

 "No I can't Sis; now that I've found out how big of a slut I am I'll never be able to quit. I love Rob and I don't want to live my life without him, but I won't be able to live without what I've been getting at your place lately so my only hope is to get Rob involved." 

 "I'm sorry baby sister; I'm sorry that I got you in this jam." 

 "Not your fault Janie. You couldn't have known what was going to happen." 

 "Yeah, but it happened at my place so I feel responsible." 

 "I'm the one who came back for more Janie. You didn't twist my arm you know and as I remember you did try and talk me out of it." 

 "Spilt milk now Abs. See you tomorrow morning. Bye." 

 As I trudged up the stairs from the basement I wondered if I ever knew Abby at all. Two guys at once and wanting to try three? Wanting to do a gangbang? She certainly didn't know me at all, not if she thought she could get me involved in the shit she was into. Jimmy Carter stood a better chance of being president again than me sitting still and letting my wife fuck other guys while I watched. 

 At least I knew what Abby had planned for me that night. An adult book store with a video arcade and booths with glory holes in them. The more I thought about it the more I thought that I could have some fun with it. Have some fun and set Abby up for the fall. I gathered that if the night went well from her standpoint she had something big to spring on me the following weekend. I would just have to make sure that Abby's night was a success.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Abby got home from her "beauty parlor" appointment and from the looks of her I would say that she went from being fucked to the beauty parlor since she didn't have a hair out of place. I knew what was coming so I helped set the stage. 

 "What's for dinner tonight?" 

 "You know honey, I thought we would go out for dinner and maybe some dancing." 

 I let my face cloud up a bit and made sure that she saw it. "I don't think so. I don't want to do that lounge thing any more." 

 "That's not what I meant honey. Just you and me and no games." 

 "Well I suppose that it will be all right then. What are you in the mood for?" 

 "How about Italian?" 

 "Mario's?" 

 "Perfect." 

 Abby was perky and bubbly all evening and when we left Mario's and went to the Grotto for drinks and dancing. She plastered herself to me and rubbed my cock through my pants. After two hours of drinking and dancing Abby said: 

 "Take me home lover. I'm horny and I'm ready." 

 As we were driving home she exclaimed "Oh look" and she pointed at some flashing lights that said "Kit Kat's Books and Arcade." 

 "Can we stop honey? I've always wanted to see what they sell in a place like that." 

 I hesitated like I was reluctant and she said, "Please baby?" I shrugged and then turned into the kit Kat parking lot and Abby and I went inside. As Abby and I walked up and down the aisles and looked at the magazines, videos and displays of sex toys and lotions and such I noticed a young guy talking on a cell and I knew that I was seeing Paul. 

 "Can we go inside and look at what's in the arcade?" 

 "I don't think so." 

 "Why not?" 

 I pointed at a sign posted just above the entrance to the arcade that said "No women allowed in the arcade." I could tell from the look on her face that she hadn't known about that and was aware that her grand plan was going down in flames. 

 I said, "I'll see what I can do." 

 I went up to the man behind the counter and handed him a fifty dollar bill. "I'd like ten bucks in tokens" I said, "and keep the change if my wife can go into the arcade with me." 

 He didn't even look up from the magazine he was reading as he slid the tokens over to me and put the fifty in his pocket. As Abby and I entered the arcade I saw the second door from the end on the left side open and a young guy come out and I was able to put a face on the name "Mike." I was a little surprised since both he and Paul looked several years younger than Abby. I made as if to go to another booth, but Abby pulled me along as she headed for the door Mike had just come out of. 

 Once inside I noticed the glory hole in the wall between our booth and the one on our right. There was only one chair so I had Abby sit on it and I stood behind her and fed tokens into the coin slot. The video that came on was two guys going at it and that caused me to raise my eye brows a tad. I assumed that that the movie playing was the one the last occupant of the booth was watching when he left and I wondered if Mike was bisexual. 

 I changed channels and found a big titted blond being nailed by two studs and then settled back to see what would happen. After watching a bit Abby worked her skirt up to her waist and ran her hand down into her panties and started rubbing herself. After a couple of minutes of that she stood up, took off her panties and told me to sit down on the chair. She unzipped me, took out my hardening cock and then facing the movie screen she sat down on me. She moaned as I slid up into her and she started rocking back and forth and moving up and down on me. 

 She bounced up and down on me for a minute or two and then out of the corner of my eye I saw a cock come into view through the glory hole. Abby saw it and whispered: 

 "Oh God honey, look." 

 "Just ignore it" I said. "Pay no attention to the pervert and he'll leave." 

 But Chuck didn't leave and Abby kept staring at the cock as she slid up and down on me. 

 "Baby, can I touch it? It is so wild seeing that and having no idea who is on the other side of the wall. Please baby, can I touch it?" 

 I hesitated and she kept after me and so I finally told her to go ahead. She reached out and touched it with her fingers and it twitched a little so she touched it again and another inch of cock came through the wall. She wrapped her fingers around it and stroked it a couple of times and I knew that on the other side of the wall Chuck was beside himself at the thought that his whore was stroking his cock while I watched. Abby whispered: 

 "Can I make him shoot honey? Can I jerk him off?" 

 Then it was my turn to play and I whispered, "Why waste time with a hand job. Suck him off if you want to, but don't expect me to kiss you until you have brushed your teeth and gargled with mouthwash a dozen times." 

 That caught her by surprise and I sensed some indecision on her part, but the she realized that it was too good a chance to pass up. If I was willing to let her do that she knew she was well on her way to getting what she was looking for out of me. She bent and licked the head and then she took the cock in her mouth. She kept fucking me as she sucked on Chuck's cock and in a short time I shot my load up into her. She got up off me and leaned down so she could do a better job of sucking on the cock sticking through the hole. I guess that it was familiarity with Chuck's cock and the way it throbbed or something like that, but she knew just when to pull off of Chuck's cock and let his cum shoot out and splatter on the floor. Abby stood up and said: 

 "Get me out of here lover; get me home and fuck me before I go nuts." 

 As I pulled out of the Kit Kat parking lot Abby was pretty quiet. It was three or four minutes before she said, "Are you mad at me?" 

 "No, but I meant what I said about you brushing your teeth before I'll kiss you again." 

 She slid over next to me and put her hand on the lump in my trousers. "Did it excite you to see it?" 

 "It surprised me that you would do it." 

 "But did it turn you on?" 

 "How would I know? I was already turned on and you were pounding down on my cock and keeping me turned on." 

 "Watching me didn't do anything for you?" 

 "Again, how would I know? I was already fucking you." 

 "I guess I'll have to do it again sometime when you aren't making love to me so I can see how you will react." 

 "What? You expect me to keep taking you back there so you can play with cocks that are pushed through a hole in the wall?" 

 Abby giggled and said, "It might be fun." 

 She unzipped me and sucked my cock the rest of the way home. When we got home and got in bed she reached for my cock and I pushed her hand away and said, "Tooth brush." She stuck her tongue out at me, but she got out of bed and went into the bathroom and I heard her brushing her teeth and gargling. I debated pretending to be asleep when she got back and then decided to take advantage of her pussy as much as I could. No telling when I'd get pussy again after I got rid of her. She came out of the bathroom, leaned over to kiss me and said: 

 "Minty fresh. Now, where were we" as she reached for my cock. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I told her that I had to work late to give her time to get on the phone with Jane. Knowing what she was up to made things easier on me. She was in bed when I got home and I woke her up and ripped off a piece. In the morning I headed for the recorder as soon as I heard the shower running. 

 "Hi Sis." 

 "Hi yourself you wicked little slut." 

 "You heard huh?" 

 "Chuck was on the phone to me before you were even out of the arcade. He couldn't believe it and I'm not sure that I do either. You riding Rob's cock while sucking on his blew his mind. How the hell did you manage that?" 

 "Rob told me to do it." 

 "You have got to be shitting me! Mr. Fuddy Duddy? Your stick in the mud?" 

 "It's true. All I planned on doing was stroking Chuck a half dozen times and maybe get him off with a hand job, but when I asked Rob if I could do it he said go ahead and suck it as long as I understood he wasn't going to kiss me until I'd brushed my teeth a zillion times and gargled a gallon of Scope." 

 "Did you?" 

 "Did I what?" 

 "Did you brush your teeth or did you try to slide a little of Chuck's goo into hubby's mouth?" 

 "I almost did. I was tempted to fake brushing, but at the last second I figured I was too damned close to my goal to jeopardize it so I gave myself a good brushing and I gargled three times." 

 "So this weekend is a go?" 

 "I think so." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Keep talking about Chuck's blow job. Tell him that it was so much of a turn on that I want to do it at least one more time and see if I can't get him to admit that he got a charge out of watching. If things go good we will go for it this weekend. If not I'll work on him for another week. I'm so close Janie; I'm just so close." 

 "All I can say Sis is good luck. Can I tell the boys that you will be over some time this week?" 

 "Tell them Wednesday. You going to let me have Paul so I can see what three is like?" 

 "I want him back." 

 "As if I could steal him from you." 

 "Got to go sweetie. See you Wednesday if I don't talk to you before." 

 So the big play was going to be the coming weekend. I made a mental note to put fresh batteries in the recorder. The ones in it hadn't been used all that much, but I wasn't going to take any chances on missing a phone conversation between then and the weekend. 

 That night I was home at my normal time and I had a surprise for Abby. I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. I picked her up and said, "Dessert first" and then I carried her up to the bedroom and dropped her on the bed. I pushed up her dress and pulled down her panties and went down on her. I worked on her clit with my mouth and her cunt with my fingers until I gave her an orgasm and then I got up and started taking off my clothes. She scrambled to get out of hers and then laid back on the bed and spread her legs wide and waited for me. 

 I fucked her as hard as I could and her second orgasm was so violent that it pulled mine from me. "Whew" she said as I fell to the bed next to her. "What brought that on?" 

 "You will think I'm a pervert." 

 "No I won't. Come on, tell me." 

 "All I thought of all day at work was you sucking that cock that came through the wall. It had me so hot that I had to go to the bathroom three times and jack off." 

 "It turned you on?" 

 "Yeah it did, but that wasn't the really perverted part." 

 "Oh? Something hotter than seeing me suck a strange cock?" 

 "Much hotter. In my mind I saw you getting off my lap and backing up to the hole so you could take his cock in your pussy. I had a picture in my mind of you bent at the waist sucking my cock while the cock through the hole fucked you from behind." 

 "You didn't!" 

 "I'm afraid I did." 

 "Oh my God honey; that is just so fucking hot. Would it turn you on if I really did it? I would you know. I would do that for you if I could be sure that you wouldn't think I was a whorish slut and leave me." 

 "I don't know baby; it is in my head right now, but if it is just a fantasy or something I'd really want to do I don't know." 

 "It would be a big step for me to take honey, but I will do it for you if you want me to." 

 "I don't know Abby. You hear about these guys that like to watch their wives get it on with other men and how much they like it, but is it really true or just so much bullshit? I know I keep seeing it in my mind and it keeps giving me hard ons, but could I do it for real? I don't know Abs, I just don't know." 

 "Well honey, there is one thing I know about it." 

 "What's that?" 

 "Talking about it got you ready for me again" and she climbed on top of me and rode me cowgirl until we both came and then she went down on me and got me up again. She got on her knees and elbows and I did it to her doggie. When Abby fell asleep she had a smile on her face. She was sexually satisfied and she was sure that she had me a dozen steps closer to what she wanted me to do. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I knew when I went to work on Wednesday that I was going to get the 'working late' call so I was parked just down the street from Jane's place when Abby arrived at five-forty. She got her bag out of her trunk and headed up the steps and just before she got to Jane's door I called her on her cell. She knew it was me from the read out on the screen and she said: 

 "Hi honey." 

 "Hey yourself sweetie. I'm just leaving the office and I wanted to see if I could catch you before you got home." 

 "Oh honey, I'm sorry, but I'm working late. We have to get that Marshall proposal out by ten tomorrow. I called home and left a message on the machine." 

 "Oh well, maybe it is a good thing that you have to work late. It will keep me from making what might be a big mistake." 

 "What mistake?" 

 "I was going to see if you wanted to go to the Kit Kat and visit the arcade again. I really wanted to see...oh never mind. Hey, maybe you having to work late on the night I wanted to try it again is a sign. Maybe the fates are telling me that it would be a mistake. Oh well, see you when you get home. Bye." 

 I could see her staring at her phone after I disconnected and I could only wonder at what was going on in her mind. On the other side of that door in front of her waited three cocks - one for each hole- and the phone she was string at had just told her that if she hadn't been at that door she would have had what she wanted - me watching her take a strange cock. I had a big smile on my face as I drove away and headed for home. 

 I was awake when Abby got home at ten after ten. She smiled when she saw me sitting up in bed and reading a book. 

 "Hard for me honey?" she asked as she undressed. "Thinking of little ole me and glory holes again? That's all I thought about after you called me honey. It is a wonder that I got anything done on that proposal." 

 She climbed up on top of me and as I looked up at the unfaithful cunt I wondered how she could even face me after being with three other guys, but there she was, riding me cowgirl and smiling down at me as though she didn't have a care in the world. 

 We both had our orgasms and as Abby cuddled up to me she said, "We can do the Kit Kat tomorrow if you still want to." 

 "Can't. I have to work late tomorrow. Smithers is in town and I have been elected to work with him." 

 "We can do it Friday then." 

 "We have the party to go to at the Danson's and we can't back out. We promised Tanya that we would be there. Probably a good thing too. Maybe keeping it as a fantasy is what would be best." 

 I could sense her disappointment when I said that and I fell asleep with a smile on my face. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I faked working late on Thursday to give Abby and Jane time to talk on the phone. Abby was hot to trot when I got home so we had sex twice and when it was over she asked: 

 "Have you given any more thought to going to the Kit Kat?" 

 "I'm beginning to think that you would really like to have a strange cock in your pussy." 

 "Only if it will turn you on baby. That is what it is all about lover; adding spice to our sex life. It is what we started out to do months ago, remember? I just want it to be good for you lover." 

 "We'll see sweetie. I won't rule it out, at least not yet." 

 She snuggled in and we fell asleep. 

 In the morning as soon as the shower started to run I headed for the basement. 

 "Hey Sis." 

 "It's about time you called. I'm sitting here going crazy waiting. Do I need to call the boys and set them up for tomorrow night?" 

 "No. We have that stupid party to go to at Dan and Tanya's. Damn it! I just wish he would have called me earlier. I would have passed on doing the foursome with the guys. I'd have missed doing it since I've been looking forward to it for so long, but another night at the Kit Kat would have gone a long way toward locking Rob into what I'm shooting for." 

 "Still going for Saturday night?" 

 "Yeah. I'm pretty sure that it will work. I t will be a little awkward at first, but I know Rob will go for it. From the way he has been talking this week he may even be the one asking me to do it." 

 "No baby, not our Rob. You may be able to drag him into it, but he will never lead the way. What time are you going to want me to have the boys there?" 

 "I'm not going to need them all. I've decided to keep it simple. I'll just need Chuck." 

 "That will break Troy's heart. He was hoping he was your favorite." 

 "It is a toss up between Troy and Chuck as to who is my favorite. The reason I want Chuck is to see if Rob will recognize Chuck's cock as the one that came through the glory hole at the Kit Kat. I'll be watching Rob's face when Chuck drops his trousers." 

 "You still plan on getting him to eat you after Chuck fucks you?" 

 "I'm going to try. I know I'll get off big time if I can get Rob to slurp up Chuck's cream pie." 

 "I still think you are dreaming if you think Rob will do something like that." 

 "I have to try. It might be my only chance." 

 "I hope you do realize that this could go bad on you." 

 "It is a chance that I have to take. I'm not going to give up fucking other guys so I need to get Rob on board with it. I love him and I don't want to lose him, but I will if he ever catches me cheating on him and the odds are that sooner or later he will catch me. My only chance is to get him to go along with it." 

 "You sure that you only want Chuck?" 

 "I'm sure." 

 "I still think it would work better with all of them there." 

 "I don't think Rob would hold still for me dancing with four guys off and on during the night. With just Chuck I can tell Rob some story and get Chuck to sit with us and then it will seem natural if I dance with him from time to time. After that it will be simple. Half an hour after we get home Chuck will ring the door bell and then we will see what will happen." 

 "Rob is a damned good man Abs. I hope you know what you are risking here." 

 "It will be fine Janie. I knew I had him when he told me he fantasized letting the cock coming through the wall fuck me." 

 "All I can say Abs, is that if he were mine I wouldn't risk it." 

 "Bullshit Janie. If he were yours he wouldn't last any longer than the other three." 

 "There is where you are wrong Abs. If any of the others had been half as good as Rob he would still be with me. Hey! Got to go. Talk with you later." 

 Now that was a shocker! I'd always though that Jane had no use for me, but she did seem to know me better than my wife. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Things moved quickly after I came up from the basement and Abby left for work. I hadn't told Abby but I had taken a day off from work. By the time she got home Friday I had rented an apartment, made arrangements with my attorney and had showered and dressed for the party. 

 I had a good time at the party even though I limited my alcoholic intake. I wanted to be sober enough to fuck Abby as many times as I could that night. I had no idea how long a dry spell I would have to go through after Saturday night. I managed four times - a personal best - and Abby wanted another, but she just couldn't get the little guy to get up and play. 

 Saturday, while Abby was out getting her hair done and servicing her herd of fuck toys, I moved everything I wanted out of the house. Abby hardly ever went into my home office so I didn't think that she would see that it was bare and I doubted that she would go into the spare bedroom and see that the room had been stripped of furniture. If she did go into the den or spare bedroom it would be over sooner and I'd miss out on what I'd planned for her, but no matter. The day was our last one together whether it ended early or late.  

 

 

===

When Abby got home I tried to interest her in a quick romp, but she said no. "I want you good and horny tonight." 

 "Oh? And just what do you have in mind for me?" 

 "Dinner, dancing and maybe, just maybe, a stop at the Kit Kat on the way home." 

 "I have any say in it?" 

 "Nope! Not today. Today the little lady is in charge." 

 Dinner was pleasant and after we went to the Grotto for drinks and dancing. We had been there about half an hour when I got up to use the bathroom and when I came back Abby was out on the dance floor with a guy that I assumed was Chuck. They stayed out on the floor for two songs and then Abby led the guy back to our table and introduced me to Chuck. 

 "Chuck works with me and he just got stood up by his date. I invited him to join us." 

 The two of them looked at me expectantly and I said, "No problem. Pull up a chair." 

 For the next two hours we talked, drank and Chuck and I took turns dancing with Abby. Around ten-thirty Abby said it was time to go and we said goodbye to Chuck and left the club. Once in the car I said, "Okay, now what little lady in charge?" 

 "Get me home Rob. My pussy is soaking wet and I'm as horny as a billy goat." 

 "No Kit Kat?" 

 "Not tonight Rob. Just get me home so you can fuck me." 

 I took out my cock and slid the seat all the way back and said, "Show me how bad you want it." 

 She giggled, slid over next to me and lowered her head. I hoped that she would get me off before we got home. I'd get a charge out of knowing that she was kissing Chuck with a mouth coated with my sauce. I still hadn't cum by the time we were a block from the house so I pulled over to the curb. Abby took her mouth off me long enough to ask me why we were stopping and I put a hand on her head and pushed it back down on my cock. 

 "I'm close baby and I need to get off. Finish it." 

 She redoubled her efforts and a minute latter I pushed my load into her mouth. Abby swallowed it all, licked my cock clean and then told me to tuck it away. 

 "We don't want the neighbors seeing you getting out of the car with that thing sticking out in front of you." 

 "I thought you liked this "thing." 

 "I love it, but if the neighbors see it they might want a taste and I'm not big on sharing." 

 Given what she had been doing the last several weeks I almost laughed at that. When we got in the house I led her into the living room, walked her over to the back of the couch and pushed her into position so she was bent over the back. 

 "What are you doing" she wanted to know as I lifted her skirt and pulled the crotch band of her panties out of the way. "This is just how you would be if we had stopped at the Kit Kat. Bent forward, skirt bunched up around your waist and a cock being shoved in your cunt" and I drove my cock home. 

 I was pounding away at the bitch's cunt and almost at my release point when the doorbell rang. "Shit!" I said, "Who the hell could that be at this time of the night?" 

 "It's Chuck" Abby panted, "I invited him over." 

 "What the hell for?" 

 "To do to me what you are now doing to me while you watched." 

 "And you didn't think that you needed to talk it over with me first?" 

 "I wanted it to be a surprise baby. I knew you would like it. All you have talked about all week is that I should have backed up to that cock in the arcade." 

 The doorbell rang again and I said, "Well he is just going to have to stand there and push that fucking bell because I'm too close to stop now." 

 I slammed my cock into her and fucked her as hard and fast as I could and she had an orgasm which triggered mine and then I pulled my cock out of her and said, "Don't move" and then I went to answer the door. I tucked my cock away as I went to the door. I opened it to find Chuck standing there with a hopeful expression on his face. 

 "Come on in" I said, "She's in the living room and she's ready." 

 As he walked in and headed for the living room I walked out and closed the door behind me. I was in my car and backing down the drive before Chuck could get behind Abby and shove his cock in her. 

 I lost a bet with myself. I figured that Chuck would see Abby bent over the couch and waiting and would get his dick out and pick up where I left off. I thought that they would finish that first fuck before Abby even wondered where I was. I didn't even get to the end of the block before my cell went off. The display told me that it was Abby and I smiled as I turned the cell off and headed for my new apartment and I left my cell off for the rest of the weekend.

 One of the chores that I had taken care of Friday was to clean out all of the joint accounts that I had with Abby. Sunday morning I called the customer service numbers on all of our credit cards and cancelled them. When I cancelled them I got a pay off balance for each account and the first thing Monday morning I used the money that I withdrew from our accounts to get cashiers checks for all of our accounts and then I mailed them in. 

 I went back to the bank and had my name removed from the savings and checking accounts leaving them both in Abby's name only and then I put half of the money left after paying off our accounts into Abby's checking account. 

 While I was at the bank doing that Abby was being served at work. The man serving the papers on her had been given an extra fifty bucks to hand her a small box when he served her with the divorce papers. The box contained my wedding ring, a copy of all the conversations that I had pick up with my telephone tap and a short note that said: 

 "Play the tape if you want to know why." 

 After lunch I went and had myself checked out for sexually transmitted diseases and then went back to work. 

 When I had gotten up that morning and turned my cell phone back on and found I had seventeen voice-mail messages waiting for me. Sixteen of them were from Abby and I deleted them all without listening to them. I had another nine calls from her between the time I turned the phone back on and ten in the morning. At ten the calls stopped. I knew that Abby was supposed to be served at ten and quite frankly I didn't expect to hear from her after she read the note and played the tape. I knew from her conversations with Jane that she had no intention of stopping what she was doing so I expected her to shrug and move on and it looked like I was right because I got no more calls from her. 

 On Tuesday when I got to work the receptionist handed me a pile of message slips and half of them were from Abby. I tossed them into the waste basket and got to work. At eleven my secretary stuck her head in my door and told me that my wife was on line two. I couldn't have Abby calling me all day at work trying to reach me so I figured I'd better take the call and get the talking over with. I picked up the phone. 

 "Yes?" 

 "Are you free for lunch?" 

 "Why?" 

 "I have some things I need to say to you, some things to tell you and I would like to do it face to face. It won't kill you to listen Rob and once I've said my piece I won't bother you any more." 

 "The B and B at twelve thirty?" 

 "See you there." 

 She was there waiting when I got there and as I slid into the booth across from her she said, "Thanks for seeing me." Before I could say anything the waitress was there to take our order. Once she was gone I said: 

 "I'm listening." 

 "How long have you known?" 

 "Since the day I had the flat tire. I came back to the house to get your spare and I heard your half of the phone conversation with Jane." 

 "Why didn't you confront me then? Why spend the last several weeks playing games?" 

 "You know me Abby. I'm the guy who wants all the facts at hand when I make a decision. All I had to go on was one side of a conversation and that wasn't enough for me so I dug deeper. Once I found out what was going on I got a perverse kind of pleasure out of knowing what you had planned ahead of time and then going along with it to lead you on. It wasn't until you started talking about doing two and three at a time and setting up gangbangs that I decided that it was time to end it. By the way, even though you have condoms in the trunk of your car I went in and had myself tested for STDs anyway and you might want to consider it. You didn't use a rubber when you sucked off Chuck at the Kit Kat and you can catch diseases that way just as easily as you can catch it with your cunt - or ass!" 

 I put some extra emphasis on "ass" since she never let me have it, but was giving it up to everyone else. I saw her wince when I said it. 

 "So, you said you had things you needed to say." 

 "Yes, I did didn't I. Well, even if you won't believe it I love you Rob. What I have been doing isn't because any failure or lack of attention on your part. I hoped to be able to keep you - have my cake and eat it too - and that is why all the silly games. I thought that if I could get you to be a participant I wouldn't lose you, but it didn't work out that way. 

 "I need you to know that I love you, that I've always loved you and that I wanted to - still want to - spend all of my life with you. I know it sounds trite Rob, but it isn't love with the others, it is only sex. Fabulous sex, mind blowing sex, but still just sex. 

 "It started by accident. You were away on business and I had dinner and drinks with Jane. We both got bombed and I decided that I had taken on too much to safely drive home so I spent the night at her place. I woke up being fucked and in my half asleep state I thought it was you and I let myself go. When I was fully awake I saw that it was a friend of Jane's. He had already given me two orgasms and I was on the edge of a third so I didn't stop and I fucked back just as hard as he fucked me. I liked it Rob. I liked the feeling of a different cock so an hour later I did it again. 

 "The next day I went out for dinner and drinks with Jane and we ran into two guys she knew. We danced with them and as I danced I wondered how much different their cocks would be from yours and the guy who had screwed me the night before so when one of the guys suggested we take the party to his place Jane and I went. I did him and before morning Jane and I swapped guys. By then I knew Rob. I was a cock hungry slut. I got one hell of a charge out of screwing all those different guys and the more of them I did the more of them I wanted to do. It was just sex Rob. Nasty, exciting sex with no love involved. 

 "My problem was that there was no way to say, "Oops, I screwed up" and stop. Once I got started it fed on itself. But you have to know Rob that I never stopped loving you and I never will. I'm sorry that things turned out this way. I really am." 

 She reached over and lightly touched my face with her fingers and I saw a tear start to run down her cheek. 

 "I'll always love you Rob. I won't fight the divorce. I don't want to give you up, but I can understand why you don't want me. My door will always be open for you Rob. Stop by and see me from time to time." She got up and left. 

 As she walked away I thought to myself, "Too bad I'm not a sharing kind of guy."
