Chapter 01 

 A kiss goes too far 

 Chloe opened the kitchen door to find Max standing there looking sorry for himself. Her first reaction was to send him away, as she wasn't dressed yet. Instead of the arrogant pose he usually struck, he looked worried. 

 "Hi Mrs Foster, is Wendy in?" he asked, sounding miserable. 

 "No. Err, she won't be long, do you want to wait for her?" Chloe asked, while stepping aside to let him in. 

 She had lied about Wendy coming home, as her daughter was staying over with a girlfriend. It was about time she spoke to him about the way he was treating her daughter. This seemed like an opportunity to confront him. They had been neighbours for about six months, and he had been messing Wendy around. Wendy put up with his arrogance, and flirting with other girls, because she had a crush on him. They were both eighteen, so she had left them to it, up until now. 

 Chloe pulled the gown tighter, as he followed her into the kitchen. 

 "Would you like a coffee," she asked. 

 "Sure," he murmured. 

 "What's the matter Max?" she asked. 

 "Its girls," he murmured. 

 Chloe should have known. He didn't say it was one girl, just girls. She was pleased he was having a problem, as he deserved it. 

 "So, what's the problem? Maybe I can help," she offered. It was intriguing, and it was an opportunity to point out how badly he had treated Wendy. She lifted her bottom slightly to hoist herself onto a kitchen stool, then stopped the movement. The gown was a little too short to sit on a high stool. 

 "Maybe you can," he hesitantly began. 

 "It's more comfortable in the lounge," she quickly said. 

 He followed her in, and when she sat on the sofa, he plonked himself down next to her. She tried to shuffle away, but the gown was caught under him, and he didn't take the hint. She sighed lightly, and he sighed heavily. 

 "So, tell me," she encouraged. Wanting to find out what it was all about, and to give him some harsh advice. A dose of reality was long overdue. 

 "Well. I don't think I'm doing the right thing. I mean, I can't keep a girlfriend for long. I need to know what I'm doing wrong. I thought Wendy would know," he said, and shrugged. 

 At the mention of her daughter, she cringed. That's all Wendy needed. Being asked how he should keep a girlfriend would be a big disappointment. It would send her into a mood for a month. There was nothing worse than a moody teenager moping around the house. 

 "Tell me all about it, and I'll help. Promise! I was a teenager once," she said, trying to raise a smile. 

 "Well, it's embarrassing. Maybe I should try to figure it out," he said, with a shrug of his shoulders. 

 Chloe put a hand on his shoulder. 

 "It's OK. Whatever you say will be between us," she reassured him. 

 "Kissing is one thing. Judy said I didn't kiss right," Max asserted, looking hurt. 

 Chloe wanted to laugh. Surely at his age he had plenty of experience. Fortunately he was looking away, feeling embarrassed, otherwise he would have seen the flash of a smirk on her face. As a married woman she had plenty of experience of life, so handling this young man would be easy. She felt more than qualified to advise him. 

 "Show me," she blurted out. She meant for him to pucker up, to demonstrate his lack of skill. She didn't expect his next move. How could she have expected a young boy to actually kiss her! It took her completely by surprise. 

 He didn't need to move closer, as their hips were already touching. He just turned his head, and leaned forward. When their lips touched her mouth was open, so he delved in with his tongue. 

 She was so taken aback by this impudence, she just sat there. His arms wrapped around her, holding on tight. She couldn't breathe for a moment. She automatically reacted from memories of teenage years, when long kissing sessions were common. She breathed through her nose, gasping for air. 

 He seemed to be devouring her! His tongue darted around hers, in a seductive dance. The sensations were overpowering after such a long time since being kissed so passionately. It was no good saying no, as her mouth was too busy. She tried to push him away. She froze, unable to move, startled like a frightened rabbit. 

 "Stop it!" she murmured around his tongue. 

 One of his hands wasn't round her back as she thought. It had slipped into the gown! If it were an accident, or not, it didn't matter. It was terribly wrong. His hand cupped her breast. Her bare breast! His fingers began to play with a nipple, teasing it, pinching it. 

 She tried to stop the unwelcome groping, only her hand was on the outside of the gown. She scrabbled at it, trying to get at his hand. The front was held tightly closed where he was leaning on it, pulling it tight around his hand. 

 "Let me go!" she wailed. The muffled words were ignored. 

 Both hands went to his shoulders to push him away. There was no strength in her arms. He was a strong high school athlete, and she was a housewife, unused to wrestling with strong young men. Although thirty-eight, she had a good body, as she had worked hard to keep slim and fit. 

 It wasn't his strength, it was her weakness preventing her from pushing him away. He hadn't exactly forced himself on her, as she had inadvertently invited him to kiss her. With anguish she realised she was acquiescing to the delicious sensations. This was all wrong! She should be fighting him off! Her arms felt so weak, she let them fall over his shoulders. 

 "Please, Max," she moaned. 

 Her head slightly turned to one side, all the easier to seal their lips together. Her tongue began to slip around his, duelling lightly, playfully, and seductively. Ignoring his naughty hands she concentrated on his tongue. It had invaded her body, seduced her, and now had her at its mercy. Her lips and tongue twisted around his, devouring him in return. 

 "Oh! Max!" she whimpered. 

 He slid the gown off her shoulders; just enough to let his other hand squeeze into the gown. Both hands played with her breasts. The light touch of his palm brushed her hot flesh. Finger tips teased her nipples. Feeling them grow long and hard, he pinched them. One, then the other. He continued to rub them between his fingers, then again one was pinched, then the other. 

 "Please don't," she implored. 

 She began to anticipate the slight pain in her nipples when he pinched them. Rolling her shoulders lifted a breast up to him, as though she were helping. Little moans were felt as vibrations in their mouths, rather than heard. Delirious from an onslaught of sensations bombarding her mind, nothing could be done to resist. Her body respond automatically to his intense seduction. 

 It was wrong! She shouldn't be letting this happen. Her body wouldn't let her fight him off, so her mind tried to escape by abandoning reason. Her mind floated around in a wash of sensations, denying all responsibility for what was happening. She couldn't let this young guy touch her breasts, so she didn't acknowledge he was doing it. 

 "No, Max. You mustn't," she tried to say. 

 The feather light touches upon her thighs were easy to ignore. They weren't real, nor happening. Nevertheless, her body reacted to the sweet caresses. 

 Her head spun from sensations assailing her mind. Her body vibrated with sexuality. She tried to deny it, but knew full well his fingers were dancing over her thighs. She tried to pull them together. Lifting her legs up, she fell back onto the arm of the sofa. Her lips parted when he at last let go, allowing her to breathe deeply. She sucked in badly needed air, in gasps. 

 "Stop it, Max, please," she begged. 

 His weight pushed her body down into the sofa, ensnaring her arms. Her head was propped against the arm of the sofa, also trapped. 

 "No! You mustn't," she whispered, on a hiss of breath. 

 He moved up her body to kiss her. At least those devilish hands had let go of her private parts. None had touched her sex, except her husband. She turned her head away to avoid falling once again into his trap. It was no good, her body was too attuned to his touch. It cried out for him. She could see her gown was open at the front, with her breasts looking as though they were on offer. 

 "Please stop, Max. You don't know what you're doing to me," she moaned. 

 She could do nothing to stop him, for her arms were trapped underneath her body. Her breathing was so deep and ragged, she could hardly talk. 

 Her eyes opened wide, looking wild with fear. She looked between them, as though she might see his hands lower down. Instead, he was leaning on them, taking part of his weight from her. Still she couldn't move. Now from fear! It wasn't her imagination. Something touched her down there, between her legs! 

 "Oh! No!" she yelped. 

 She tried pulling her knees together, clapping either side of his legs. All she had achieved was to clasp her legs upon his strong, powerful thighs. He was lying between her legs, keeping them separated. When he pushed forward she cried out! 

 "No! Please, no. You can't do this, please," she begged. 

 She hefted her hips up with all her might, attempting to throw him off the sofa. Instead, her legs slid up either side of his. She felt the head of his cock pierce her soft, hot flesh. She had unintentionally thrust her sex at him! She had impaled her body on his cock! 

 She turned her head back to him, looking in his face, seeing there a smirk of conquest. All he had to do was relax his arm muscles to lower his body, and his cock would penetrate her further. 

 "Please, don't. It's, wrong!" she stammered. 

 "You seem to have enjoyed it so far Mrs. Foster," he grinned. 

 Her lips flapped uselessly on unutterable words, from the realisation he was right. She must not let it go further! She must put a stop to it now, only the words wouldn't form in her mind. She was trapped under him, unable to escape! 

 "We mustn't, it's wrong. Please don't do this," she cried. "I didn't mean to kiss you," she weakly said. 

 This young guy had physically and mentally disabled her. All he had to do was lower himself into her unresisting body. It was dreadful to think how open and ready she was. How awful was she to be so easily worked up by him. Even now her body was aching for him. 

 "Please don't. I'm a married woman, I can't do this, it's wrong!" she croaked. 

 She couldn't tear her eyes away from his face. She was searching for a sign of compassion. Could this callous youth possibly understand what he was doing to her? 

 She felt him move. For a moment she thought he was pulling away from her; rejecting her. The sudden painful thought threw her off balance. How could she be aggrieved by the thought of him pulling his cock out of her sex? 

 "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let you kiss me. It's my fault. Please let me go," she murmured. 

 She felt him settling onto her, not with his full weight, but with a purposeful push of his hips. He was toying with her! Not only with her body, but with her feelings, and mind. His cock settled into her, pushing carefully, fractionally further inside. She heard a gasp, as though it were somebody else far away. 

 "We mustn't do this. There's others to think about. Let me go, please," she whined. 

 Knowing he was playing her like a toy didn't help. She was unable to withstand the torment of being wound up without release. She felt him push a little deeper. Any moment she would snap, and thrust up at him with all her might. Was that what he was doing, holding back to frustrate her? 

 "Stop it now, please! I won't say anything to anyone. Just stop, please," she groaned. 

 Ever so slowly his cock invaded her vagina. Deeper, and deeper, she felt it penetrate. As much as she wanted to thrust up at him, to reach the inevitable, it was impossible to move. The look of satisfaction on his face had her mesmerised. It was difficult to look away, or even close her eyes. The mocking expression told her he had her, and wasn't letting her off lightly. 

 "Do it!" she challenged. 

 The feathery light voice was strange in her ears. The awful words betrayed her. 

 

 "Do you want me to fuck you?" he nonchalantly asked. 

 His words were clear, her mind was not. It swirled with lust and outrage. How could she allow this young boy to take her. What choice did she have? She felt his cock nudge her so very deep, she gasped with a pathetic whimper. 

 "Yes! Fuck me," she loudly declared. 

 He rose up, pulling up, and up, until she feared losing the hardness that was so desperately needed. He plunged down inside her body, seemingly filling her entire body with cock. She whimpered again, when he pushed against her cervix. It was an unusual feeling, yet not unpleasant. 

 "Fuck me! Oh! Fuck me hard," she wailed. 

 The rhythm settled into a steady pounding of her vagina. With every downward plunge, his hips hit hers, and his cock hit deeper inside than ever experienced before. With every pounding of his cock, she responded with an animal like wail. 

 "I'm nearly there, don't stop now!" she whined. 

 When he pushed home and held still, she knew he was ready. Surprisingly, so was she. He began to judder, and his legs pressed hard into the sofa. His cock powerfully expanded, and he thrust hard into her, with all his might. She imagined feeling him ejaculate, with splashes of hot cum spurting directly into her womb. 

 "Fill me up! Oh, God! Fill me up!" she cried out. 

 He dug his toes into the sofa and pushed hard. The head of his cock pressed tight against the entrance to her womb, as he cum again, and again. She had never felt a penis so deep, or such a powerful spurt of sperm. Her orgasm started before him, and continued still. So sensitive was her body, that she felt the slightest twinge of his cock. 

 "Yes! Oh! Yes!" she hissed. 

 On reaching the end of an orgasm, it built again! A third time took her completely by surprise. Eventually her whole body collapsed, from the emotional tension, finally leaving her exhausted and replete. She lay there like him, breathing heavily. 

 Recovering first, he pulled the gown away from a nipple with his teeth, and sucked it into his mouth. She opened her mouth to complain, but either she was deaf, or no sound emerged. She lay quietly watching him suck on an over sensitive nipple, while he tried to engulf as much of a breast as possible. Again he was playing with her body, only this time she smiled with pleasure. 

 She wanted to ask him if he loved her. The silly notion was quickly dismissed. She cleared her throat. 

 "We shouldn't have. I shouldn't have let you," she hesitantly said. It sounded pathetic, so she gave up. 

 Her arms were still wedged underneath her, and he was too heavy to budge. It was embarrassing feeling his wet cock against her thigh. Something had to be done, as difficult as it was, something had to be said. 

 "You enjoyed it, didn't you?" he smiled, then went back to sucking on her breasts. He had both of them out, playing with one, then the other. 

 "You shouldn't be playing with a neighbours breasts," she quietly stated. The nonsense statement almost made her laugh. 

 "It's wrong to suck on your breasts, but alright to make you cum?" he mocked her. He flashed her a bright smile, then sucked loudly on a nipple. 

 "No! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have let you do anything to me. It was all wrong, and all my fault," she said, sounding sorry for herself. 

 "We both enjoyed it, so, don't worry," he smiled. "I haven't been coming around here to see Wendy. It's you I wanted," he calmly stated. 

 The serious look on his face made her heart flutter. It's just the after affects of an orgasm, she told herself. There was no way she could be flattered by the remark. He was just an adolescent, making it up. It was silly to feel pleased that he had been taking notice of her, though the illicit satisfaction was difficult to shake off. 

 "You're playing with me again," she said, about his words, not about what he was doing to her breasts. He began to kiss his way down from her breasts. A hand held her in place, while his lips and tongue teased her belly. He carried on. 

 "No! Please! You mustn't. I'm not a toy to be played with," she complained. 

 She struggled, though not enough to get free. There was enough of an excuse that he held her down with his hand on her chest. Lips sucked and kissed lower with every touch. On reaching her sex, the nips and bites diverted to her thighs. Now the lips and tongue were jumping around, so she couldn't anticipate the next touch. 

 "No! Please! Let me go," she weakly spoke. 

 Before she could firm up her voice, he took hold of her lips, to nip them with his teeth. She squealed in delight. He pushed exploratory fingers inside, to feel how open she still was. She began to leak, yet he still probed and explored. He hadn't seen a woman's sex up close, and found it fascinating. She hadn't let anyone explore her like this, ever. It was embarrassing, and all the more so that she was leaking his sperm. 

 "Stop it, please. We've got to talk," she implored him. 

 He reluctantly rolled off onto the floor. He pulled her on top of him, and held her tight. 

 "Kiss me," he demanded. 

 "No! You've had your way with me, isn't that enough?" she crossly spoke. 

 "I'll kiss you then," he said, and did so. 

 She defiantly kept her mouth tightly shut. He sucked on her lips, bit them, then travelled around her neck with a thousand kisses and licks. She grabbed his face and kissed him full on. It lasted for awhile. Coming up for breath she looked at him seriously, then shook his head. 

 "I'm a married woman. You can't just barge into my home and take me. I belong to someone else," she seriously explained. 

 "I didn't realise you BELONGED to someone else. So, you're a slave are you? I'll buy you then," he teased. 

 "You know what I mean!" she firmly said, only to laugh along with him. "It was nice, more than nice. Never, ever again. I can't cheat, won't cheat," she said, with a voice running low, as she realised she was a cheat. 

 She had cheated on her husband with this young lad. Her forehead dropped onto his chest, with a sob threatening to develop into a full blown storm of tears. 

 He slapped her bare ass. 

 "Oww!" she protested. 

 She still wore the panties and gown, but they were almost pulled from her body. He noticed she hadn't stopped him playing with her, and hadn't protested too much. She was trying to be adult and sensible. The glow of an orgasm was still affecting her, so it was easy to keep her compliant. 

 "You enjoyed that so much, I want to pleasure you again," he asserted. 

 "No! Not now!" she yelped. The glint in her eyes was contradicting the protest. 

 "When, after a shower?" he laughed. 

 "I meant no, not ever!" she forcefully said. 

 He noticed she wasn't fighting him off, or attempting to escape. He pushed her off, and rolled on top of her. He separated her legs with his, and held her still. 

 "As you can't decide, I'll decide when we fuck," he firmly told her. 

 Chloe groaned with trepidation, only now realising what she had gotten herself into. This young guy had an infatuation with her. Maybe he did mean he had been here to see her, not her daughter. 

 "It's no good, we can't. Don't you understand? I have a family. I feel bad enough already. Please don't make it worse," she pleaded. 

 She knew a great weight would hang over her soon. Once the flush of orgasmic pleasure was over, the guilt would take over. It was already beginning to, with the follow up of self-pity close behind. 

 "No more! Let me up, I need the bathroom," she ordered. 

 She didn't hear him follow her. Her troubled thoughts were loud enough to cover his footsteps. Reaching into the shower to set it to burning hot, she felt his arms encompass her. He lifted her up, and stepped under the waterfall. His hands were everywhere, and way ahead of hers.  

 

 

===

He soaped her all over. When both his hands cupped her bottom and sex, she gave up. They were interlaced, making it impossible to break the hold on her crotch. The feeling of hands soaping between her cheeks, circling her asshole, between her lips, cupping her sex in his palm, defeated her. 

 She flung back her head into the spray, and groaned loudly. A fitful orgasm rocked her legs. It wasn't deep, it was like the shower, all over her body, like a rainstorm. His hands carried on playing with her, front and back. He was prolonging the orgasm with fingers probing her pussy, and her asshole. 

 Every time she thought it was over, he triggered it again. 

 "No more, please!" she cried out. 

 Both hands were flat, leaning all her weight against the tiled wall. She began to slide as her legs gave way. He held her up with a finger in her pussy, and another in her ass. As her hands slid down the wall, her ass was drawn upward. 

 She was only partially aware of the awkward position. She was on hands and feet, with her head in the corner of the shower stall. He slid a finger from her pussy, with another still holding onto her asshole. He replaced the finger with his cock, sliding into her easily. He began to fuck her steadily, while she moaned in time with every inward thrust. It took him a long time to cum, by which time she was nearly unconscious. 

 He carried her to the bed and dried her with a comforter. He threw that on the floor, and climbed into bed with her. With arms wrapped tightly about her, he fell asleep. 

 "Max! Max! Wake up!" Chloe whispered. 

 There was no need to keep quiet, as nobody was in the house. She felt guilty over what happened, as though they had committed a crime, and needed to be secretive. She watched him come-to from a deep sleep. The innocent boyish face brought on a feeling of affection toward him. However inappropriate the feeling, it was difficult to shake off. 

 "You've got to go!" she urgently insisted. 

 "Why?" he asked, while knuckling his eyes. 

 "Because, that's why!" she explained. 

 "That doesn't make sense. You don't really want me to go. I'll just go out to my friends, and brag about fucking a beautiful woman," he boldly stated. 

 "No! You can't. That is so bad. Please don't say that," she said, sounding more hurt than angry. 

 "You had better let me stay. We need to talk about what happened, and where we go from here," he said. 

 He sounded more caring and sensitive now. She wondered if he had said that terrible thing to shock her into letting him stay. Surely he couldn't mean it. 

 "Alright. You're right, we need to talk," she conceded. 

 It would be better to try and explain how this moment of madness affected her. It would be disastrous if anyone found out, though she dare not emphasise the point. Surely he could understand she was a married woman and a mother, so it had to be kept quiet. Maybe that line of reasoning should be avoided as well. 

 Why was it the woman had to take responsibility for every mistake. It was a big, bad mistake, and could get even worse if she didn't keep it secret. They wandered into the kitchen, while she tried to think through what to say. 

 He put a hand on her shoulder, pushing her onto a kitchen stool. She gave him a small smile when he asked if she took sugar. She watched him make a pot of coffee, looking into cupboards for what was needed, not bothering to ask her. He was independent and strong minded. 

 She again wondered if he had meant what he said, or was it a sop to keep her happy. Did he really visit Wendy just to see her? She looked good for her age, yet how could he see anything in a woman twice his age? 

 "Thanks," she smiled at him, and wrapped her hands around the warm mug.

Deeper into trouble 

 'You must promise me not to tell anyone,' Chloe calmly stated. 

 Inside she was less than calm. She tried not to show the anxiety over how ruinous it would be if her scurrilous secret was exposed. At the same time it was important not to reveal how perilous her position was, for fear he used it against her. 

 'I promise, though, under condition we spend the night together,' Max blurted out. 

 It wasn't likely she would agree to such an outrageous suggestion, so he kept his fingers crossed behind his back. He moved close to her, pushing against her knees. Sitting on a stool the gown was pulled up around her thighs, though she was too preoccupied to be bothered about it. 

 'You can't expect me to agree to that!' she complained. 

 'Why not. We both enjoyed it,' he bluntly stated. 

 'It was wrong, and two wrongs don't make a right,' she groused. 

 The lame phrase sounded feeble even to her. She would have to talk him around, or lose the last shred of dignity that remained. If she upset him he might leave and tell his friends that he seduced her. 

 'One last fling. You're a beautiful woman,' he quietly spoke. 

 He ran his fingers through her long hair, ending up with a palm cupping her cheek. 

 'Please, don't start that!' she moaned. 

 'You deserve a bit of fun. Let me stay and pamper you. I'll give you a massage, then leave if you want me to,' he promised. 

 'Oh! No you don't! You know what your touch does to me,' she retorted, though not pushing away his hands caressing her face. 

 He was glad to hear her admit he seduced her. It gave him a feeling of power over the woman. It was possible she might give in again, as long as he had the chance to work on her. The other hand joined in, by brushing hair away from her face. Lifting her chin he moved close in for a kiss. 

 'No! That's how it started last time!' she pointed out, and turned her head away. 

 Her voice sounded less confident. As long as he took it slow, he was sure to win her over. 

 'Relax. Don't worry. Nobody will know. You'll have a nice naughty secret to remember. Something no one can take away from you. Remember how pleasurable the love making was, how deep an orgasm you had. How wonderful we were together. I've always wanted you. You look so delicious, I could lick and nibble you all over,' he whispered in her ear. 

 About to ask him which orgasm he meant, the thought was hurriedly buried. Never before had she experienced multiple orgasms. In the last few hours she had enjoyed so many orgasms, she lost count. How on earth did this young guy do that to her? 

 She turned her head to face him. There was an intention to tell him to leave, though nothing was said. Instead she let him kiss her. Knowing her fate was sealed, left her feeling so much more guilty, she wanted to cry. Instead, she kissed him back. 

 Lips took over from hands, to caress her face and neck. Hands cupped her breasts. Fingers tweaked her nipples. He was taking his time with a strong determination to seduce her. His strong hands smoothly massaged her breasts. He sucked on her lips, bit her neck, licked and whispered in her ears. 

 She breathed heavily from the soft words of affection he whispered into a sensitised ear. 

 She lifted her chin for him to explore her neck. He was kissing his way down to her breasts. Anticipating the caresses to her susceptible nipples was thrilling. Without realising it, her knees parted. His hands delicately tripped over her thighs, lightly stroking them. So much attention was too much to resist. 

 His hands wrapped around her bottom to lift her off the stool. She wrapped her legs around his waist, and he carried her to the kitchen table. He perched her bottom on the edge, manoeuvred himself close, then pushed roughly into her. 

 The previous gentleness contrasted with the hard pounding he gave her. The rough sex had her moaning with pleasure. She wailed over his shoulder, and pounded on his back with both fists. 

 'Fuck me hard, Max,' she cried out. 

 Feeling his legs shudder was a sign of an imminent orgasm. Unable to resist, not wanting to, she climaxed again. Holding him close she wailed lightly, almost sobbing. When he pulled her off the table, she felt his cock slip from her sex. It felt as though it belonged there, and its parting was sorrowful. 

 He managed to half carry her to the bedroom. This time they didn't bother to shower. They wrapped themselves in each other. Not bothering with sheets or blankets. He was her comforter. She was his soft pillows. He rested his face on her chest, and she nestled his head upon her breasts. 

 She stroked his hair while he slept, thinking she wouldn't sleep, from not wanting to waste the feeling of being needed. She fell asleep with a smile on her lips, and an expression full of satisfaction. 

 Chloe was half asleep when she moaned, with a smile still on her face. They were spoons tightly pressed together, with his arms around her, both hands fondling her breasts. Feeling his hardness pushing at her sex brought her around. Not again! She thought, then felt him enter. 

 'Max!' she protested. 

 He hadn't asked, or even warned her! He was simply helping himself to her body. She had never experienced such an audacious act. Her sex was way ahead of her, for it was aroused and ready. She wondered what he had done while she was asleep for her sex to be so wet. His penis was slowly penetrating her vagina, gently pulling back, then repeating the delicious movements, getting deeper with each push. 

 Her mind quickly caught up to enjoy it. 

 'Max!' she lightly breathed. 

 She tried to reach behind to caress him. He had his arms wrapped around her pinning her arms to her sides, preventing movement. It felt as though she were tied up, unable to do anything but accept him taking her. She helplessly lay there being fucked, and was thoroughly enjoying it. 

 'Faster, Max,' she said. 

 'What do you want, tell me how you want it, wonderful Chloe,' he heavily breathed in her ear. 

 'Fuck me faster!' she implored him. 

 Damn! This young guy was getting her to talk dirty. This was another first for her, and she wondered again how such a young guy did these things to her. Nearing a climax, she let loose. 

 'Keep going, Max! Fuck me deep, Max!' she groaned. 

 She clenched her teeth as though in pain. Her head rocked back, hitting his nose. He stopped moving trying to recover from the pain in his nose. The hesitation in his movements tormented her. 

 'Please, Max, fuck me!' she demanded. 

 The pain spurred him on to push with all his strength. He shifted his weight to get a better leverage, shoving hard and deep inside. His cock slid across her clit, drawing a guttural sound from her throat. 

 'Yes!' she repeated over and over as she climaxed. 

 Feeling her shuddering body, he knew he could cum now. He spurted his load deep into her. He kept his cock still, forcing it as deep as possible. He was rewarded by her clasping him tight, with strong inner muscles. The tremors subsided as his cock retreated from her. 

 'Max!' she groaned. 

 The sound of her voice was warm and tender now. She turned to face him within his lessening grip. She kissed him full on the lips. When they parted she probed him with her tongue. Tingling sensations sensitised her lips, as was the rest of her body, still vibrant from the orgasm. 

 Pushing herself up the bed, she was able to pull his head into her cleavage. It was comforting to watch him suck on a nipple, then the other. The afterglow exaggerated her feelings, leaving her besotted and deeply in love. She knew it would pass, yet wanted to enjoy the wonderful feelings while they lasted. 

 With a start she woke up. Daylight flooded into the room, announcing he had stayed the night in her bed, despite protestations. Looking back they seemed weak and her resolve had been pathetic. A phrase often used by a friend came to mind - the miserable bitch needs a good seeing too. Chloe had always thought it vulgar, yet she repeated it to herself. 

 'I've had a good seeing to,' she whispered. 

 Had he awoken her in the night to fuck her, or was it a dream? A pleasant feeling still embraced her, from just laying there staring at him. She knew she was acting stupid, like a lovesick schoolgirl. Facing up to reality could wait till later. 

 She felt naughty and mischievous. Leaning over his sleeping body, she quietly took a peek at what had invaded her vulnerable body. Lifting the sheet, she sighed heavily. His cock was large, even when soft. It was no wonder she felt sore. A hand went between her legs to cup her sex, but it was too late to protect her private place. 

 He stirred. She was fascinated watching him wake up. He stretched, and rolled slightly to one side then the other. He yawned then eventually opened his eyes. The look of happiness on his face when he saw her was gratifying. 

 'Good morning beautiful,' he plainly said. 

 She studied his face to find he meant it. 

 'Good morning, naughty boy,' she teased. 

 'Did you enjoy the naughtiness?' he asked, with a sly grin on his face. 

 'I did. Did we do it in the middle of the night?' she shyly asked. 

 'We did. You only cum once that time,' he goaded her. 

 'Stop counting, it doesn't matter, I mean it was good all the same,' she said. 

 'Just good?' he asked. 

 'Yes! No! It was wonderful, really wonderful every time,' she said, and kissed his lips. 

 'What are we having for breakfast? Perhaps breakfast in bed,' he said, and reached for her. 

 'No! You're not having me for breakfast. We need to shower. Separately!' she scolded him. 

 'Later then,' he suggested. 

 'No,' she quietly said. 'We must stop this madness, it can't go on,' she plaintively said. 

 'You dropped your knickers quick enough yesterday,' he playfully said. 

 'I wasn't wearing any!' she countered. 

 He laughed at her and she couldn't help joining in. 'So you go around without panties? Are you a naughty slut?' he mischievously asked. 

 'Yes! Just for you, I'm a slut for you,' she announced, then regretted it. 

 She was behaving like a stupid slut which was bad enough, but declaring she was his slut was terrible. She was a married woman with a daughter his age, yet it was difficult to bring herself back to earth, and reality. 

 Chloe unwrapped a new set of underwear. She threw the bra and panties back in the draw. Instead she selected an old washed out bra and panties which were designed to put him off. She put them on, feeling confused over why she had intended to wear a sexy underwear set, saved for a special occasion. It was concluded she needed to feel sexy, even though he had to be sent on his way, and all this nonsense had to stop. 

 Wearing a decent dressing gown, she walked into the kitchen to be pleasantly surprised. 

 'Breakfast is served, madam,' he announced. 

 'It smells delicious, not sure I can eat all this,' she commented. 

 They both tucked into bacon and eggs, with enough toast to spread marmalade over what was left. They kept glancing at each other and smiling. 

 'Tea or coffee,' he asked. 

 'Tea, I'll make it,' she offered. 

 'Sit there, I'll make it,' he ordered. 

 'I've never had breakfast cooked for me,' she mused. 'How come you can cook?' she asked. 

 'I always cook breakfast for the women I seduce, did you like it?' he innocently asked. 

 'The breakfast, or it?' she teased back. 

 'Had to look after dad. How do you like your tea, strong?' he asked. 

 She remembered his mother had died, or something, a long time ago. She looked sadly at him for a moment. He looked her over, with an appreciative look, and she smiled back. 

 'Oh! Weak, just a touch of milk,' she said. 

 She watched him sip at the coffee, and had to look away from his stare. 

 'Stop it,' she said. 

 'What?' he asked, feigning ignorance. 

 'You're looking at me like that,' she grinned. 

 He wiped a hand over his face, to reveal a serious expression. 'Is that better?' he cheekily asked. 

 'Yes, maybe, I'm confused. I'm not used to all this. I don't jump into bed with anyone,' she tried to tell him. 

 'I know. You're a lovely kind lady. Attractive, and very sexy,' he said. 

 'Don't say that so seriously, I might start to believe you,' she complained. 

 He started the washing up and she went to fetch the paper and mail. He told her to sit down, refusing her help with the washing up. Hearing an anguished yelp, he quickly went to her. She was sitting at the kitchen table with a letter in her hand. It was shaking as though she were waving a flag. Her head hit the table and she began to sob. 

 He knew what it said. The bastard husband had affairs, and this time he'd found a replacement for Chloe. The letter wouldn't have spelt it out so starkly, but that was near enough. Last week he heard the bastard talking to his father, before leaving on a so called business trip. He wanted to be straight with her, only he came up with excuses why he should selfishly think of himself. The husband wasn't thinking of her at all. 

 Max heard it all a few days ago, and still fumed a silent anger. His mother had walked out on them when he was four. He knew what it was like to feel abandoned. It was strange that he was still here, as he hadn't intended to seduce Chloe. It occurred to him to give her comfort, yet he didn't think it would go this far. He was fond of her to start with, and from yesterday it had grown far more serious. 

 He wrapped his arms around her, trying to comfort her. He took the letter from her hand and quickly read it. The nasty bastard said he was leaving her, with no mention of the other woman. It was obvious though. 

 'Just let it all out. Cry till you can't cry anymore,' he told her. 

 Chloe sniffed, blew her nose in the heap of tissues he gave her, and pulled the dressing gown tighter. 

 'Wait here, Max!' she said. 

 From the fierceness of her voice he wondered if she was coming back to shoot him. There was no return address on the letter, so she wasn't going to drive to the husband to exact revenge. As a representative of all males, she might be intending to make him suffer. He heard her going through draws in the bedroom, and wondered again if she was looking for a weapon. 

 She called him from the bedroom and he quietly peered in. 

 'Come in, Max,' she said. 

 Chloe opened the dressing gown, and shrugged it off. 

 She was dressed in lacy black underwear, sheer stockings, a suspender belt, and shiny black high heels. Seeing his look of surprise turn to lust, satisfied her. 

 'Fuck me, Max,' she calmly said. She may sound calm, but her whole stance displayed anger. 

 Chloe stepped close to him, and stripped him. He did nothing to stop her. He let her get it out of her system. If this was the way she wanted to exact retribution, then so be it. When his shirt was off she kissed his nipples. She pulled his jeans down, and kneeled to pull them off his feet. 

 The surprise was so great he hadn't fully hardened. She was in too much of a hurry to wait. She dropped his boxer shorts, and leaned in to kiss his penis. She licked it, hesitating to take it in her mouth. This was going to be another first, but she wasn't thinking of that. She cupped his balls in one hand, and guided his cock into her mouth with the other. 

 He quickly hardened. Seeing a neighbour on her knees sucking his cock, was an awesome sight. She was a mature, married woman, giving him a blow job! She was having difficulty, choking, and he guessed she was unsuccessfully trying to deep throat him. 

 He grabbed her head, and pulled her away. She took a deep breath, gasping for air. 

 'On the bed,' he told her. 

 He helped her up off her knees and laid her on the bed. He slid next to her, and spooned her. 

 'It's going to be all right. Just a matter of time,' he said. 

 'I knew he was playing around. Has done so for a long time, and I ignored it. I just shut it out of my mind. He had no time for me. Never did those things we did. Nothing exciting. No fun together. Was it my fault?' she asked. 

 'Some men are shits,' Max said. 

 'Some men are lovely,' she said, and squeezed him tight. 

 'Don't just fuck me, Max. Make love to me. Pretend you love me, please, Max,' she said. 

 'I'm falling in love with you, Chloe. I really am,' he said. 

 Without changing from spooning her, he manoeuvred his cock between her thighs. She pressed back on him with wet lips, ready and waiting for him. He pushed in, squashing her cheeks. She tightened her bottom, squeezing his cock, so it felt as though he was deep inside. He knew he wasn't but it seemed enough for her. 

 He couldn't push much, from laying on his side. It was slow and steady screw, which by now, he recognised she was enjoying it. He wrapped his hands around both breasts, gently clutching them. 

 'Oh! Max, I'm cumin! Keep going, keep going,' she whined. 

 It wasn't long before she began to orgasm. The familiar trembling of her limbs then the cycling of her legs announced it. The stockings rasped loudly as her legs moved around and around. 

 'Keep still!' she demanded. 

 He arched his back, pushing in as far as he could, pressing her bottom almost flat. He held onto her with a tight grip. The orgasm seemed to run on and on for ages, while she was lost in a world of her own, breathing heavily. 

 Concentrating on her pleasure left him frustrated, but he didn't mind. He was fascinated with her reaction, the trembling and the way she moved her legs. The sounds she made were intense, animal like grunts. Although he pretended to be a man of experience, this was all new to him. Did she really not have a fulfilling sex life before? She certainly let go now, with him. 

 'Oh! Max! You didn't cum. Don't leave me, it feels so good inside,' she said. 

 He shifted slightly, pushed, and sawed his cock over her swollen bud. He was pleased to have hit the spot, on hearing her moans. It was only a slight movement, but effective. He massaged her breasts and nipples with the same rhythm, as the sawing movements over her clit. 

 'Max! You are so wonderful! Keep this up and I'm yours forever,' she sighed. 

 Her words inspired an idea. She wanted him, perhaps she needed him, and he loved the idea of keeping her, so why not? He hadn't planned anything past kissing, making her feel good, and playing around for a little while. The idea of spending the night with her seemed outrageous, yet the night had come and gone, and he was still here. 

 He fell asleep while thinking it over. He woke up to find her sitting on the edge of the bed, smiling at him. She was wearing a dressing gown, a lighter, shorter, cotton one. 

 'Something to eat? I need to keep your strength up,' she cheekily grinned. 

 He was tremendously thirsty so poured the juice down his throat, then sipped the hot coffee. She piled the pillows behind him so he could lay the tray on his lap and eat the meal. 

 'Another dressing gown? What happened to the stockings?' he asked, with another fork of egg and bacon on its way to his mouth. 

 'Needed to wash the stockings, and the other dressing gowns,' she laughed. 

 It took him awhile to catch on. 'Sorry,' he said. 

 She laughed at him. 'I'm not. Haven't had a young guy's sperm all over me for a long time,' she cheekily smiled. 

 She wasn't usually so forward and lewd over such private matters. He brought out the naughtiness in her. 

 He screwed up his face, and looked at her sternly. 'When last did you have a young guy here in bed?' he pouted. 

 'I was young once you know,' she shot back at him, trying to sound hurt, and failing when she laughed. 

 'Oh!' he said. 

 'You're jealous!' she teased. 

 'No! Yes, I am. I want you all to myself,' he told her. 

 'For as long as it lasts, I'm all yours. Do whatever you like with me. It has been exciting and wonderful. Let the fun continue,' she said, and pushed a hand under the sheet to grab his cock.  

 

 

===

Monday morning came around too quickly. Her whole life had changed over the weekend. Her husband had left her and she had acquired an ardent young lover. For the first time in her life she let go in bed, and in the kitchen too! Never before had she been so experimental and wanton, and it was down to Max. How could a young eighteen year old do that to her? 

 Max came into the kitchen looking sleepy. 

 'Breakfast?' she said, with a smile in her voice. 

 'Sure, it's your turn,' he quietly said. 

 'Don't talk, just eat, and listen,' she demanded. 'We've had a wonderful weekend. It can't go on like this. No! Just listen to what I have to say. You will meet someone your own age. I'm too old for you. My marriage is in pieces and I've got to pull myself together. I've been thinking about the consequences of a divorce. There's a lot to do and I've got to work out so much. I can't live in a fantasy world, I've got to face the real world. Sorry, Max,' she said. 

 'You're right, you've got to do something about it. What though,' he asked. 

 Chloe was taken aback that he was being so sensible and not making a fuss. She figured it was all lies when he said he was falling in love with her. Of course it was, it was the sex effecting him, just as it had her ensnared. Not now though, it was the beginning of a new week and a new life. 

 'You've had what you wanted, so show me some respect. Don't tell anyone, please,' she said. 'At least do that for me,' she said, with a meaningful look in her eyes. 

 'Of course I won't tell anyone. I do respect you. I've wanted to be close to you for a long time. Didn't think we would be this close,' he grinned at her. 

 She didn't know what to say. He was staring at her, seemingly daring her to admit something she couldn't. 

 'I can't. You. You're nice, Max. I have feelings for you, of course I do, after. . .' she choked, unable to continue. 

 This wasn't planned when she thought through what to say to him. It had all been so simple, in her head, thinking it through while making breakfast. 

 'Eat up, your food is getting cold.' he told her. 

 Better than digging herself deeper into the mire, she took his advice. Her cheeks were flushed from having almost admitted she had deep feelings for him. At his age he wouldn't have understood they must part, and not see each other again. The idea left her feeling empty and sick. She pushed the plate away, unable to swallow. 

 'What's the matter?' he asked. 

 The look of concern melted her resolve to keep her problems to herself. Perhaps it would be a good idea to give him a dose of reality, to explain things that grownups had to face. 

 'The mortgage for one thing. How am I going to pay that? There's Wendy's allowance to pay for while at college. I'll be out on the street if I can't make the payments,' she mournfully stated. 

 Max thought over the husband's letter. He didn't say where he was, just that he would try and help with expenses. The rat probably meant it at the time, but was just as likely to forget about it. 

 'I'll look into the mortgage. It's what we do, my father an me,' Max helpfully suggested. 

 'No, I don't want anyone to know,' she protested. 

 'No one will. I'll deal with it in the office. A re-mortgage package. I'm supposed to take care of the office while he's away,' he said. He looked at his watch and back at her. 'Where do you keep the paperwork,' he asked. 

 'I don't know. He used to look after all that. I don't know anything. Our bank accounts, loans, bills, anything,' she moaned. 

 She felt so helpless and useless. Thinking about it with a resolve to sort it all out was one thing. Confronted with the actuality of doing something was entirely different. She suddenly realised how isolated from household finances she had become. 

 'Let's take a look in the spare bedroom,' he suggested. 

 'Yes, that's where he kept the paperwork,' she brightened, on feeling they were making a start. 

 'This is a complete mess. Folders stuffed with documents, just anyhow. It looks neat until you delve in. Look, Chloe, I've got to get to the office, I haven't time now,' he said. 

 'I'll take them into the office and sort it out. You'll have a clear picture of what needs to be done then,' he said. 

 His firm, no nonsense manner, dragged her along into agreeing. She looked worried. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her lips. 

 'It's alright, Chloe,' he said into an ear. 'We'll look through the options when I get back this evening,' he said. 

 The deep voice sounded so commanding and calming. She couldn't relax, but felt a little relieved he was looking into things. 

 At the door he gave her a hug, patted her bottom, and kissed her deeply. She gave him a little smile. Watching him walk away left her feeling empty and flat. She was glad she hadn't sent him away for good. He would be back later, which gave her some comfort. 

 She got dressed and ploughed into the housework, as though nothing untoward had happened. She tried to forget the letter, and instead thought about something nice. All that came to mind was Max. She couldn't shake him, or what they did, from her mind. 

 Over a cup of herbal tea, she sat wondering how it happened. She must have been vulnerable and in need to let him hold her, and kiss her. After that everything got out of hand. It was madness! Why did she let him walk out of here with all her financial papers? He would come back, he said he would. Maybe that is why she let him take them, so he would come back. 

 The kitchen table came into focus, for her to remember being taken right here, where this cup stood. Her bare bottom had been right there, while he fucked her. A hand drifted between her legs to press her sex. She gripped it hard. 

 'It's too late now. He's seen it, touched it, used it. He said he cared for me. He will come back,' she hoped. 

 She squeezed her crotch and allowed a finger to crease her lips. It was one way to make the bad thoughts go away. 

 *** 

 'Max! I've been waiting for you,' she said. Her voice was whispery and light. There was a touch of desperation to it. 

 'It's all right, Chloe,' he said, and gripped her shoulders, steering her out of the way, so he could get through the front door. 'Sorry I didn't call. We've been very busy. I needed to make sure the staff knew I was in charge. Dad had told them, but he's away now,' he said. 

 His buoyant attitude lightened her mood. That afternoon she had been morose, thinking about things too much, and feeling useless. 

 'Something to drink?' she asked. 

 She fell into the usual routine for when her husband came home. She shook her head, to clear the foolish notion. He was just an eighteen year old boy, so she should offer him a coke, not a cocktail. 

 'Something to eat would be good. I'm starved. Didn't have time for lunch,' he enthusiastically spoke. 

 'You enjoyed your first day in the office,' she smiled. 

 'I've worked there a lot, but never been in charge. It's a lot different, more responsibility when my father's not there. They were bringing me problems to test me,' he laughed. 'I passed, though there were some close calls,' he mused. 

 After dinner Chloe cleared the kitchen table, and Max pulled a folder out of his case. 

 'It's not good I'm afraid,' Max started to say. 

 How could he tell her that damned rat had been overspending. She wasn't stupid, she would figure out it was on another woman. 

 'Just tell me Max,' she quietly spoke. 

 'There's more bills than available cash. We need to track him down, and get a good lawyer. He must be made to pay his share,' he said. 

 'I know him well, of course. If he can get away without parting with his money he will. I'm on my own. What can I do?' she asked. 

 She no longer thought of him as a boy, he had become her sole source of help in putting her life back together. 

 'My office can re-mortgage the house, for a lower monthly cost. That will help lessen your outgoings. You need a job, of course. That can wait. The immediate thing is to save your home. I've brought some papers for you to sign. Do you trust me to help you with this?' he asked. 

 'Yes, I think so, Max,' she said, searching his face for an answer. 

 There was no one else she could, or wanted to confide in. Facing the bank manager, and dealing with people about utility bills on the phone, was daunting. Having left everything to her husband, now left her feeling useless. Letting this young man take over was wrong, but it was an easy way out of her difficulties. 

 'Let's get it over with. Tell me where to sign,' she sighed. 

 Max moved behind her, turning over pages of tightly printed text, pointing to where she must sign. Even if he gave her time to read the official documents, there was no chance of her being able to understand it all. It was all a blur of print, with her hand deftly scribbling one after another of the pages. 

 'There all done. You can relax now. Tomorrow I'll set things up so you have a breathing space, to get used to the situation. Don't worry, I'll look after you, Chloe,' he reassured her. 

 'Thanks, Max,' she sighed. 

 'You're right, I need to get a job. I've been a housewife since college, so who would employ me, without experience,' she moaned. 

 'Don't worry about that now. I'll phone contacts and see what I can do,' he said. 

 'That's the point, what can I do?' she asked. 

 'Come on, cheer up, it's not that bad,' he smiled. 

 'I'm glad you're here, Max,' she tried to smile back. 

 He guided her off the chair, and gripped her tight. 'I told you I care. I do. You're a beautiful woman, attractive, very sexy,' he said. 

 The sincerity in his voice left her feeling better. Being held close fed a desperate need. She could forget he was so young, and she no longer had a husband, so there was nothing to feel guilty over. She didn't want to watch television like an old couple. Going out with him wasn't a good idea, as she would be reminded of the age difference. All that remained was the bed. 

 'I want you, Max,' she whispered. 

 For a moment she wondered if he heard her. Did he still want her that way? Had he decided she was a hopeless case. Did he now see her as a pathetic old woman, needing care? 

 'Are you sure?' he asked. 

 She didn't want his charity. She needed him, and that overrode her inhibitions. 

 

 'Yes, Max. I want you,' she said. 

 He kissed her deeply. He took his time, tenderly smooching her. He broke off to kiss her face, and neck and ears. He sucked her upper lip into his mouth to gently bite it. He delved into her mouth, ardently this time. 

 'Fuck me, Max,' she moaned. 

 The naughty demand was a surprise. In a daze she was led to the bedroom. He began to undress her, and she joined in, almost ripping her clothes off in haste. She fell back on the bed, trying to look sexy and inviting. She pulled her legs together and bent them, hiding her sex. It was too late to look demure and fetching. She was naked on a bed, ready for her young lover. There was nothing to say. 

 She opened her arms to him, expecting him to join her. Instead, he climbed onto the end of the bed. He pulled her legs apart. She yelped a little sound of excitement on realising what he was up to. She felt like a young girl, experiencing everything for the first time. It was a long time ago since experiencing such intimate foreplay. 

 She arched her back, and moaned loudly. It felt as if her whole sex was being devoured. He sucked her lips into his mouth, and nibbled on them. A tingling sensation ran through her entire nervous system. Her stomach clenched and unclenched. Her heels thumped the bed. Her hands grasped the air, tight. 

 Her breasts felt so sensitive they might burst. Her whole body was tense, then gradually relaxed, with a feeling of sinking into the bed. An orgasm washed over her, through her, around her, every part of her body was soothed. Feelings overwhelmed her. Tears formed in the corners of her eyes. After awhile the screwed up sex face relaxed. 

 She lay back letting him suck, lick, and bite her naughty bits. The orgasm washed over her again. Less dramatically it returned to leave her tingling all over. 

 Her breathing returned to normal and her eyes opened wide. The room seemed so bright. Everything looked intense, as though in black and white. 

 'You OK?' he asked. 

 She turned her head to find him beside her, not touching, just staring at her. 

 'You were screaming,' he smiled. 

 'Was I?' she croaked. 

 'I'll get you some juice,' he offered. 

 'No, please, cuddle me,' she said. 

 *** 

 Chloe was hooked, and knew it, yet couldn't to a thing about it. How could a young boy do that to her? In bed he took her to places she hadn't dreamed of. There was more to think about, more urgent things needed dealing with, other than sex. It was a distraction, yet so very wonderful she gave in to him. 

 The week progressed unlike any other. Her whole life had changed. As usual Chloe was cleaning the house, except it was for a young lover, not a husband. She smelled the sheets before putting them into the machine. Their mingled sex smells were strong, and she breathed them deep. It was a kinky thing to do, yet it was difficult to resist. It was worrying what he was doing to her, though the excitement drove her on. He was introducing her to uninhibited sex, and for the first time in her life she wanted to experience it all.  

 

 

===

Her young lover takes over 

 Max's father was opening a new branch office and wouldn't be back for a couple of months. In the meantime, Max was left in charge of their old office, and was pleased to get the staff on his side. More importantly, he had a beautiful older woman as his lover. He felt like a conquering hero, with everything going his way. 

 The woman's husband had left her, and wouldn't be back. It was a shock, and she was hurt, feeling emotionally vulnerable. Added to that, her finances were in ruins. He took all the paperwork concerning the money situation, with a genuine intention of doing his best for her. He hadn't expected her to give in to his advances so easily, but she had, and he felt very satisfied with how things were progressing. 

 He gazed at her while she cooked dinner, and smiled. 

 'You're wonderful, and I'm a lucky man,' he said. 

 'What brought that on?' she laughed. 

 'I was just thinking how lucky I am to have such a beautiful woman looking after me,' he said. 

 'Wait until after dinner,' she playfully warned him. 

 'I wasn't thinking of that. I was,' he faltered. 

 Chloe recognised his contemplative mood, and wondered what he was thinking. Was she a mother substitute? His mother had walked out when he was very young. That might explain the crush he had on her. He admitted he hadn't thought to start an affair, and that it happened spontaneously. If she considered the coincidence of him being there when the letter from her husband arrived, she would have been suspicious. Before she could dwell upon it, the cooking demanded attention. 

 Together they cleared away, and sat with a cup of coffee, smiling at each other. 

 'Do you have any more of those nice underwear sets?' he asked. 

 'Do you think of nothing but sex?' she teased. 

 'When I look at you, no,' he teased right back. 

 'You mean the stockings and suspenders, no,' she said. 

 'You need to buy more,' he suggested. 

 'I don't have any money,' she reminded him. 

 'Don't worry about the mortgage, I've fixed that, and I've taken over the bills,' he said. 

 'What do you mean about the mortgage?' she asked. 

 'I bought the house. The utility bills are paid out of my account, so that's not a problem. I arranged for the interest on credit cards to be frozen, but they had to be returned to the lenders. You'll have to deal in cash from now on,' he explained. 

 'You bought the house? How?' she said, looking worried. 

 'My grandmother left me a lot in her will. It's a good investment,' he explained. 

 'But how did you? What did I sign the other day?' she asked, becoming more worried. 

 'You signed a power of attorney form, so I can deal with the debts,' he explained. 

 'I didn't realise, you didn't tell me, why did you do that?' she asked, sounding cross. 

 'You needed help, and weren't in a fit state to deal with it,' he shrugged. 

 'But this is serious, Max. I can't let you do this,' she complained. 

 'You were right about the bills. Your finances are out of control. The bank was ready to foreclose. The credit cards are maxed out. It's a real mess,' he explained. 

 'Is it really that bad? Is that why he ran out on me?' she said. 

 It looked as though she was going to burst into tears. 

 'Don't worry. I'll take you out shopping tomorrow. Buy you some sexy underwear, to make you feel good,' he cajoled her. 

 'I need food not underwear,' she tried to joke. 

 She tried to smile at him, wanting to hide her feelings. This was very worrying. Buying naughty underwear would please him, not her. 

 'What's the matter?' he asked. 

 'Nothing,' she said, and got up to wash the coffee cups. 

 He wrapped his arms around her, tightening the grip to stop her squirming away. 

 'Tell me,' he forcefully spoke. 

 'You've taken over my finances. I didn't realise what you were doing,' she stated. 

 'It's just until you get on your feet. I'll get you a job, and you can re-build your life. It will be alright, you'll see. I told you, I care about you, and I'll look after you,' he reassured her. 

 'Thank you, Max,' she said. 

 It would take far more than kind words to allay the uneasiness. He was being nice, even fulfilling a promise to care for her, yet it didn't feel right. He was an eighteen year old, and she felt it was taking advantage. Or maybe he was taking advantage of her, though there wasn't much she could do about it. Nothing at all. 

 'Come on, cheer up. You're safe with me here,' he said. 

 She did feel safe in his arms, so relaxed and gave in. 

 'Come on, let's go to bed,' he encouraged. 'We'll have a nice cuddle.' 

 She was about to make some excuse, and send him home. Then she realised things had changed between them. It was going to be very different from now on. It was now his bed, his bedroom, and his house. Her husband had run out on her, and Max had taken over responsibility for her. This young man had completely taken her over, without bothering to ask her opinion. 

 'If you want,' she reluctantly agreed. 

 She slipped between the sheets and pulled them up under her neck, waiting for him to emerge from the bathroom. She felt shy and vulnerable. He began kissing, and caressing her body. 

 'You're not very enthusiastic tonight,' he said. 'Is there something wrong?' 

 'No, it's alright,' she said, and kissed him gently on the lips. 

 He kissed her more enthusiastically. As a married woman she knew how to fake it. With the minimum of effort she responded to his foreplay. Making amorous noises, wriggling her curvaceous body, and kissing his body when it came in range. It was a dreadful thought, that she had to play along with this boy to keep him happy. 

 He made his way down the bed, and she breathed a sigh of relief. It was hoped it sounded like a passionate sound. With him down there, she wouldn't have to put on a sex face. She laid back with legs apart, trying to ignore him, needing to think things through. He was an eighteen year old, unused to the responsibilities of adulthood, which left her in a precarious position. 

 She felt his lips, tongue, and nipping teeth travelling over her thighs. His lips reached hers and she couldn't help lifting her hips, offering her sex at a better angle. She deeply sighed, giving in to the delicious feelings. Her body was becoming energised, full of life, with churning emotions. When he found her clit, engorged and sensitive, a garbled sound of approval escaped her mouth, from deep within her throat. It sounded as though she were gargling. Only with him did she make such a basic animal sound. The intense foreplay was mind numbing, sending her into a private little world of pleasure. 

 It was a pleasure she couldn't resist, and he was patient and persistent with foreplay. She laid back letting him suck her sex into his mouth. Despite the earlier resolve to just endure it, she became ready for him. 

 As soon as he entered her, an orgasm rocked her, shaking her whole body. His enthusiasm and caring love-making, renewed overwhelming feelings of emotion. She wrapped her arms around him, pressing his face into her breasts, wanting to make him happy in return for the wondrous place he had taken her. When he fell asleep in her arms, she smiled and stroked his hair. The feeling of wrongness melted away, to be replaced by a deepening affection. 

 *** 

 Next morning, Chloe was up early, letting him sleep. It gave her a chance to think without him influencing her. It was true that she needed help with the finances. At least she no longer had to worry about losing the house and finding somewhere to live. He was paying the bills, but what about Wendy's college fees? 

 Wendy had phoned on Sunday to say she was off with friends for a few days. She had no idea when she would be back. How easy it was for the young, without life's boring responsibilities. She sat at the kitchen table with her head in her hands. The coffee was going cold. 

 'What the hell have I got myself into?' she asked the coffee cup. 

 If it had answered back, she wouldn't have felt more insane than she already did. 

 'That boy has me trapped!' she whispered. 

 At last it was sinking in. Her whole life had changed. Max owned the house and everything in it, leaving her with nothing. No income meant it wasn't possible to save for a deposit on an apartment. She'd have to ask him for money to live on, until she could get a job. 

 'Hell! I'm a grown woman asking a boy for pocket money!' she fiercely whispered at the coffee cup. 'He's going to buy my panties, even my panty liners every month. I'm sleeping in a young boy's bed, having to pander to his whims, or I'll be on the street!' 

 It was true. Relying upon an adolescent was a precarious existence. If he grew tired of her, or found a girl his own age, what then? Would he throw her out on the street? The independence and freedom adulthood brought, had been stripped from her, leaving her feeling like a pathetic child. She was dependent upon Max for food, clothes, make-up, and absolutely everything. 

 'I'll have to quickly learn what he likes in bed, or I could be on the street,' she moaned. 

 'Damn it! I know what he likes. He likes me in his bed, fucking me,' she said, and coarsely laughed. 'I'll be fucking him for pocket money. Does that make me his cheap whore?' she quietly asked the cup. 

 'I can't blame him. It's all my fault,' she whined. 

 She had already succumbed to his advances. Would she continue submitting to him, when he made more adventurous sexual demands? He was too young to have developed kinky habits. Though, he wasn't old enough to know what he liked, and would be experimenting, trying things out. She would have to play along with him, letting him experiment upon her. 

 She would be his plaything, kept for sexual games. She would be nothing more than his fuck doll! Chloe felt small and insignificant. If she didn't want to be thrown out on the street, she would have to pander to his whims. To keep his interest and receive an allowance, she would have to show enthusiasm, and feed his imagination. 

 'Oh, hell! I'm so wet and horny just thinking about it,' she moaned. 'Surely I haven't always been like this, a dirty slut. Has he brought it out of me, or has he changed me? Damn, it! I don't care. I just want him to fuck me,' she laughed. 

 After breakfast, Max was enthusiastic to go shopping. This was a new experience for Chloe, as her husband hated spending money. It made her wonder what he had been spending it on. She felt angry that he got them into debt, obviously by overspending on his mistress. 

 She asked Max to wear a business suit, so that he looked older. She was still apprehensive over meeting anyone she knew. What would they think of her, with a young lover, for it would show on both their faces. With her on his arm he felt older, and more responsible. She felt embarrassed. 

 'Let's get something in here,' he said. 

 'They're a bit expensive. We need food and essentials, rather than playthings,' she reminded him. 

 'I guess you've always been sensible, so it's about time you relaxed and had some fun. Besides, if we buy frozen food it will need to be taken home. This first, then the essential things,' he scolded her. 

 'We can look I guess,' she sighed. 'My husband kept me on a tight budget, and it's difficult to change a lifetimes habits.' 

 'You deserve a treat,' he smiled. 

 'It's a treat for you,' she smiled back. 

 'Whatever,' he laughed as they walked in. 

 Having her submit left him feeling bold. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to walk into a women's underwear store, let alone look through the scanty things on display. 

 'I can't wear those,' she whispered. 'Look at the price!' 

 'I want you to wear them for me,' he admonished her. 

 'Alright, it's up to you, I guess,' she reluctantly agreed. 

 He took a dress off a rack and held it up to her. 

 'No, that's going too far, look how expensive it is,' she complained. 

 'Try it on,' he cajoled her. 

 Waiting outside the changing room, he glanced in, and saw a woman reflected in a mirror. She was shimmying out of a dress. She bent over in a thong, showing off a cute ass. He knew he should look away, and did, only to check no one saw him, before continuing to stare. She stood upright and straightened her hair. She hesitated a moment, and he thought he'd been spotted in the mirror. 

 Obviously not, for she struck a seductive pose, pushing out her breasts in a flimsy bra. She lifted them, and let them bounce back into place. She turned around and adjusted the thong, giving him a better view of her bottom. Turning to face the mirror, she pulled at the thong, adjusting it, almost pulling it away from her pussy. It pulled tight between her lips, showing off a camel toe. 

 

 Another woman approached the changing room, and so he turned away, trying to hide a raging hard-on. The woman appeared from the changing room, wearing a short dress. He had seen what she was wearing underneath, and couldn't shake off the image. When she approached, he was sure he'd been caught spying on her, and she was going to berate him. 

 'I wonder if you can give me a man's opinion,' she said. 

 It wasn't a question, it sounded like a foregone conclusion. She took his arm, pulling him to the underwear racks. To him they were just a blur of colours. 

 'Do you think these will go better under this dress?' she asked. 

 'Better than what?' he sheepishly asked. 

 'Better than the underwear you were admiring,' she smiled at him. 

 'I, didn't, err,' he stuttered. 

 'You're cute, so shy, and young,' she purred. 

 'Be careful what you do with that, you might hurt someone,' she seriously spoke, while pressing his cock through the suit trousers. 

 Max felt her hand on him, and the slight squeeze almost set him off. He looked around hoping no one had seen. Chloe was looking for him, and the store wasn't so big that she didn't spot him. 

 'What did she want?' Chloe angrily asked. 

 'Some advice, a man's opinion,' he lamely said. 

 'I bet she did. You're looking after me, no one else,' she crossly spoke. 

 Her face wasn't green, but the jealousy was clear. She looked across the store at the woman. She was built like a model, skinny, only with large breasts. 

 'They're false,' she declared. 

 'What do you think?' she eventually asked. 

 'You look so sexy, I don't think I can wait till we get home,' he said, with enthusiasm. 

 She was about to say his arousal had better not have anything to do with that woman. Instead she shut her mouth. She changed her mind about the dress being too expensive. 

 'I'll get you something else to wear with it,' he said. 

 He handed her packets of stockings and suspenders, and told her to put them on. She was about to tell him she only wore tights, then caught the woman eyeing him up. Damn the hussy! The bitch wasn't going to steal her young man. 

 She reappeared looking nervous. He took hold of her hand, and said, 'Come on, lets pay for them, and do the rest of the shopping.' 

 'I'm not sure about this. I thought you were buying these clothes for the bedroom. I can't wear such a short dress outside!' she complained. 

 'I might let you change into something else, if you're good, and don't complain,' he firmly stated. 

 It was just a joke, but she seemed to take him seriously. He was a little surprised how often she kept giving in to him, and wondered why. 

 'Well, err, I guess so. Whatever you say. I just hope we don't meet anyone I know,' she quietly spoke. 

 The woman joined the queue, and smiled at Max. 'That's nice, buying a present for your mother,' the woman said. 

 'He's not my son. If you must know, he's my lover,' Chloe bragged. 

 She hefted a shoulder while turning away, dismissing the rude woman. 

 Chloe hadn't wanted to leave the store in the short dress, now she couldn't get out quick enough. It felt uncomfortable being bitchy, as it wasn't in her nature. Knowing it was down to jealousy, and protectiveness over Max, didn't make it feel any better. 

 As they walked through the mall, she couldn't help glancing in store fronts at her reflection. She kept pulling at the hem, as though stretching it to cover her thighs. It was a beautiful summer dress, well designed and made, expensive, but she wasn't used to showing off so much leg. 

 'I must look like mutton dressed as lamb, in this dress,' she complained. 

 'You look beautiful and very attractive,' he told her. 

 It kept her quiet for awhile. As it cost so much, she certainly didn't feel cheap. That thought reminded her that he was paying for it, and everything else. If he asked for everything back, she would be left naked in the mall. She was a kept woman. The ideas made her chuckle, as did admitting to that woman he was her lover. She looked at him, and a sudden thrill overtook her. She felt as though she were walking on air. 

 'Shoes next,' Max announced. 

 'This store is too expensive, let's try the one over there,' she suggested. 

 Max considered the discount store for a split second, then pulled her into the upmarket shop. 

 'How can I help you?' an assistant asked. 

 'How about shoes?' Max couldn't resist teasing the young assistant. 

 'Good choice, sir,' the girl sarcastically threw back at him. 'Anything in particular?' 

 'A sensible pair for the office, and some high heels,' he stated. 

 'What size are you, sir?' the girl said, with just the faintest of smiles. 

 He laughed, and Chloe gave her a number. 

 'Why is it women are playing with me this morning?' he asked. 

 'You're young, handsome, and . . .' Chloe looked him over with a look of curiosity. 'There is something about you. It's not just the suit, it's the way you stand and talk. Confidence, you seem full of quiet confidence,' she said. 

 'Oh,' he quietly responded, still none the wiser. 

 'I won't be able to walk in these!' Chloe sighed. 

 The girl agreed, and switched to another pair of high heels, 'These aren't so crippling, and you can actually walk in them, not far though,' she said. 

 Next to the first pair, they seemed almost sensible. The girl quickly picked up on who was paying, and therefore who to please. At first Chloe wobbled while walking around the store, eventually learning the right pace and gait. They were surprisingly comfortable, though she realised her toes would ache if worn for too long. 

 'They are nice. Surprisingly comfortable and the blue matches the dress. Are you sure they aren't too expensive?' Chloe asked. 

 Although feeling guilty, she again relented to his insistence. She'd never been treated like this before, and it was hard to get used to. Her husband had been a miser, from growing up in a poor family. It made her head spin to think how much had been spent on her so far, and he was buying her more shoes. 

 'These shoes for the office are too expensive. We could get something similar far cheaper,' she complained. 

 'Relax. They're paid for now. We'll go for a coffee, then get you something to wear for the office job you'll be getting,' he said. 

 'What if I don't get a job? It will be a waste of money,' she grumbled. 

 'You will, don't worry,' he encouraged. 

 Max watched her struggle onto a bench seat. She wasn't used to the high heels, or the short hem, and nervously pulled at it. He pushed the table up to her, a little too quickly. He sat down and pulled his chair close. 

 'I was thinking of a skirt and jacket, in dark blue. What do you think?' he asked. 

 'What? Could you pull the table back, I've caught my leg the wrong side of the table leg,' she said, while struggling. 

 'Forget that, what do you think? For the office,' he repeated. 

 She looked up and asked, 'For what office?' she distractedly said. 

 She glanced over his shoulder then quickly down at the table. 

 'I can't keep my legs together!' she hissed at him. 

 'I thought you were a fine lady, yet now I learn you're a hussy,' he laughed.  

 

 

===

'Eh? No! I mean my leg is caught,' she complained, in an urgent whisper. 

 The waitress turned up and took their order. 

 As soon as she left, Chloe quietly told him, 'Pull the table back, so I can free my leg.' 

 'I can't, someone's sitting close behind me now. No one will see under the table,' he said. 

 'Those two over there. Don't look!' she admonished him. 'They're sitting on a sofa, low down. They can see up my dress!' she complained. 

 'How can I see them, if I don't look?' he asked. 

 Her head was down, looking at a menu, yet her eyes were focusing on someone past his elbow. She was blushing, with an expression fluctuating from guilt to embarrassment and back. Maybe it wasn't guilt after all. It bore a resemblance to the look she wore when excited. 

 'They're discussing me,' she crossly spoke. She flicked her eyes down to her lap, and back at them. 'They can see those little panties, and everything down there. I'm in those damn stockings and garter belt you made me wear. They can see stocking tops and the straps,' she complained. 

 He could tell she was clenching her thighs with no effect. 'Can you lip read?' he asked. 

 'Why do you ask that? Of course not,' she dismissed his remark. 

 'How do you know what they can see?' he queried. 

 'I just know. Trust me, I'm a woman. We grow up learning to cover up against you men,' she admonished him. 

 She was telling him off, though it looked as though she was enjoying the attention. 

 'One of them has bent to do his shoe lace. Damn! The other one has put his coffee on the floor! They're blatantly looking up my dress!' 

 'Don't worry about it. You've made their day. If there's something you can't do anything about, get used to it,' Max advised. 

 'I'm just saying, that's all. Why are men such silly boy's. It's all your fault for making me wear these skimpy panties and stockings. I can feel the panties pulling into me,' she complained. 

 'Just sit back and relax, don't let it get to you,' he said. 

 'You wouldn't want to show your dick off to the waitress would you? Oh, silly me. Wrong example,' she sarcastically said. 

 'I think you're enjoying it,' he accused. 

 She squirmed on the seat, then suddenly stopped. 

 'What's the matter?' he asked. 

 Her face had gone a deeper shade of red. 

 'When I move, the dress pulls up further around my thighs,' she quietly said. 

 'Pull it down then,' he said. 

 'Not while they're watching, they'll realise I know. They'll think I've been showing myself off. Damn! The panties have pulled tighter. They are red like the leather seat,' she said. 

 'What does that mean?' Max looked bemused over it all. 

 'It means, looking like a hussy. That's what you called me. It will look as though I'm not wearing panties. Why did I let you talk me into wearing these insubstantial things. They're really staring now!' she moaned. 

 'Don't look at them. Keep your mind off it. Talk to me,' he said. 

 Max pointed to the menu she'd been pretending to examine. 'Shake your head,' he told her. 

 She shook her head, as though not wanting what he was pointing at. 

 'It's like that time in college. A few friends jumped into a car for a lift to the beach. There were three of us girls in the back, with me sitting in the middle on some towels. The driver adjusted his mirror, but I didn't realise what he was doing at the time. My legs were up, either side of something, like now. In those days we all wore short tight skirts,' she said, to mitigate the error. 

 'It wasn't until half way there, I realised why he kept looking in his mirror. I dare not move, pretending I didn't know what he was doing. He had a clear view up the skirt, eyeing my white panties. I was mortified,' she said, looking far from worried. 

 There was a gleam in her eye when she said, 'I fidgeted uncomfortably and my friends grabbed me and tickled me. That made it worse. The skirt rode up, showing off my thighs, like now. Only now the panties are indecently fragile,' she said. 

 Max could see how worked up she was. Was she aware of it? The complaints over the stares weren't so forceful, and she wasn't doing anything about it. 

 'Shall I pull the table away, so you can slip around to this side?' he asked. 

 'No, don't do anything, you'll attract attention. If I pull my leg up to get round, the panties will show, err, oh, dear. They're hardly covering me down there,' she whispered. 

 'So those guys can see your pussy?' Max teased. 

 'Oh! God! Don't say that. The damn things are cutting me in two,' she protested. 

 'What's going on down there? You must be opening up to them,' he goaded her. 

 'The crotch is just a thin piece of cotton disappearing between my lips. Those men can see what's happening to me,' she struggled to say, between heaving breaths. 

 'Max! I think I'm going to cum,' she quietly moaned. 

 'Better do it quietly,' he smiled. 

 'Please Max, do something,' she pleaded. 'I can't cum in front of all these people!' 

 He leaned forward to whisper, 'You're a sexy woman. Enjoy the attention. I'll kiss you're pussy when we get home, the way you like it. I'll suck all your naughty bits into my mouth, and nibble on your clit.' 

 'That's not helping, Max,' she groaned. 

 She couldn't any longer pretend ignorance. She was looking over his shoulder, directly at them, wearing her sex face. 

 The waitress delivered the coffee and slammed the spoons on the table. Chloe recovered enough to bring herself together, and tried to bring her breathing rate down. 

 'Max, you bastard!' she breathed at him. 

 'Did you cum?' he grinned. 

 'No. I'm horny as hell! You better take me home and fulfil your promise,' she warned him. 

 'Drink your coffee and we'll finish shopping,' he laughed. 

 Maybe the two strangers had an appointment, or had to leave to relieve themselves. In any case they left, leaving a large tip. Chloe was too embarrassed to look at them. 

 When they left, Chloe grinned at her young lover, and said, 'That was so bad. I've never done anything like that before. You've done something to me. You keep making me do things,' she said, no longer complaining. 

 'Come on lets go,' he said. 

 She was hoping he meant to take her home. Instead he firmly guided her toward another store. On the way they walked over a grid, and her dress ballooned up. She struggled to control it, with panicky hands at the front then the back. He laughed at her, then grabbed an elbow to drag her off the air vent. 

 'Damn! You did that on purpose!' she wailed. 

 'Of course. It was funny seeing you struggling. Just a bit of harmless fun,' he told her. 

 She was looking around at the faces staring at her. Some surprised, others smiling. At least they weren't cheering. 

 'No more surprises, promise?' she asked. 

 'No! It's about time you admitted to enjoying it,' he said, with great amusement. 

 Damn him! He was playing with her again. She felt like a boy's toy, and at her age it was humiliating. To make it worse, she couldn't help getting worked up. This was like nothing she had ever done, or felt before. The excitement levels coursing through her body were affecting her mind. She was losing all her inhibitions, behaving so badly, it stimulated her all the more. She was caught in a delicious circle of arousal. 

 'You've got a business jacket, skirt, and shoes. We've also done the proper shopping, as you call it. We can go home now,' Max said. 

 'Good! I don't think I could stand any more of your games,' Chloe light heartedly complained. 

 When they arrived home, Chloe threw the frozen food into the freezer, and grabbed his hand. He pretended not to understand what she wanted. 

 'Please Max, I need you,' she implored of him. 

 'I'm just a guy, you'd best tell me exactly what you want,' he teased. 

 'Kiss me down there, Max. Come on Max, please,' she openly begged. 

 She knew he wanted her to talk dirty, and it did turn her on. He was introducing her to all sorts of filthy things. Nice things! 

 On the kitchen floor, he moved between her thighs. She'd already ripped her panties off. He kissed her glistening lips. 

 He looked up at her, and asked, 'Is that what you wanted?' 

 'Max! Lick me, suck my cunt into your mouth, please!' she begged, and cajoled him. 

 If he wanted her to beg and talk dirty, she was prepared to sell her soul. She was desperate for him to finish what he started. 

 She arched he back on feeling his tongue lick her slit. 'Oh! Yes! Max!' she cried out. 

 She couldn't wait for him to enter her. The orgasm was urgent, and desperate, not like the usual deep al powerful ones he usually gave her. 

 'What are you doing to me Max?' she hoarsely murmured. 

 'What do you mean?' he asked 

 'You're turning me into a wanton slut, a hussy,' she said. 

 'Am I?' he asked, sounding amused. 

 'You're playing with me, Max. I'm your sex toy,' she accused. 

 'Interesting idea. From now on, you are my sex toy,' he laughed. 

 He continued stroking her body, and settled to kiss her nipples. He was trying to give each a fair amount of attention. She lay back helpless, unable to stop him. Her mind was swamped with arousing sensations, leaving her to weak to resist. 

 'Do that again, please,' she begged. 

 His fingers stroked her thigh, continuing upward, through her wet slit, over a swollen labia, to press on an engorged clitoris. As the fingers slid back down to the crease between crotch and leg, his other hand made the journey upward. He began to refine the journey, on hearing her moaning. 

 'I'm cumin! Yes! Keep going!' she implored him. 

 *** 

 The caring way he made love to her, the shopping trip, and that damn woman in the store, all combined to win her over. She lay panting on the kitchen floor, not caring if anyone walked in. She was deeply affected by the orgasmic afterglow. No longer suffering from an urgent passion, she serenely lay back letting him suck on her nipples. 

 This wasn't the first time they had made love on the floor, or in the kitchen. With her husband, she'd only made love in bed. With her wonderful young lover, they had sex on the kitchen table, and now on the floor. She was thinking of where else they could do it. Dare she suggest outside somewhere. He might know some secluded place where they could get away with it. 

 She suppressed a giggle, as he was dozing. 

 She thought over what happened in the coffee shop, and felt a thrill. It had motivated her desire to rip off his clothes once home. They hadn't even made it to the bedroom, she had been so excited. She had told him she was horny. Had she ever been like that before? Certainly if she had, she'd never dared tell anyone. 

 'Mmmm, that's nice,' she whispered. 

 She felt him flicking his tongue over a nipple, that had been sucked into his mouth. His fingers were lightly stroking her thighs. He'd told her to order a pizza, rather than cook. It meant she could lay on the kitchen floor letting him tease her, instead of cooking. He was good at it, and she was learning to love it. She was hooked, and knew it, but didn't care anymore.  

 

 

===

Chloe gets a job 

 Chloe scrambled up off the floor, when the doorbell rang. She looked worried as to who it might be. She looked at herself in the mirror, to see the recognisable signs that she'd had sex. Not loving making, this was pure sex. 

 'Hey! I've got to answer that,' she complained. 

 'Go ahead, but don't pull it down, until you've paid. Then make out you hadn't noticed,' Max ordered. 

 Chloe opened her mouth to refuse, then thought better of denying his authority. The excuse was that he had to be obeyed, as he was the master of the house. It felt like a feeble excuse. She was still sexed up like a slut, after the shopping trip, and having wild sex on the kitchen floor. That was the real reason. 

 'Here's the money. Drop it on the floor when you open the door,' he told her. 

 She walked to the front door with the back of the skirt up, showing off her thighs, and suspender straps. She opened the door to a rough looking pizza delivery guy. She thought his unhygienic image didn't look right for someone delivering food. 

 He stared passed her, while handing over the pizza box. She shivered a little, from knowing he was looking into the mirror behind her. As ordered she dropped the money while grabbing the box. 

 'Sorry,' she needlessly said. 

 Chloe turned and bent over to grab the bills off the floor. Nervousness had her scrabbling around for the bills, dropping one again, and having to reach for it as a breeze fluttered it around her feet. She could feel the same breeze tickling her bottom. The little red panties hardly cover her ass, and they were rolled up between her cheeks. 

 Damn! After having sex the whole crotch was still pushed aside. The rough guy could see it all, from the way she was bent over. 

 'Here let me help,' he said. 

 Looking at him over her shoulder her face didn't show rejection as it should have. Still heavily under the influence of arousal, it was impossible to think straight. Being so nervous she croaked something unintelligible. 

 She felt him pressing up close to her upended bottom. His dirty hard jeans scraped her soft cheeks. He leant over, holding her in place, as he reached for a dollar note. The side of his hand purposely brushed a breast. With head down, she watched it rub her breast, noting how hard her nipples were. 

 'Oh! Fuck!' she murmured. 

 It was awful to realise she was so turned on by exposing herself to a stranger. It was near impossible to murmur an objection, let alone shout at him for taking liberties. Her young lover had turned her into a complete slut. Before Max took over her life, she behaved demurely, even lady like. Now she was out of control and behaving like a wanton slut. 

 She must stop him before he released his cock, and took her! It would be so easy for him to do it, as she was still wet and open from having sex with Max. Her panting revealed how ready she was to be mounted. That's how it would be, a bitch on heat being mounted by a stray, scruffy dog. 

 'Chloe, where's the pizza?' Max shouted from the kitchen. 

 The pizza guy let go of her body and stood back. The voice sounded hard and demanding. He didn't want to get into a fight with an irate husband. He already had a broken nose, from reading the wrong signs of a frustrated housewife. He almost ran down the path to his bike, and roared away. 

 Chloe slumped to the floor on hands and knees. Her ass was exposed to anyone walking by, while she tried to calm down. She thought of herself as a dirty bitch, on heat, ready for any passing dog to mount. 

 Max closed the door. 

 'Max!' she heavily whispered. 

 'You got too carried away there,' he seriously spoke. 

 'Sorry, Max,' she warbled, still not under control. 

 'I'd better watch out for you. Didn't realise you were so easily sex up,' he laughed. 

 Chloe didn't know what to say. It was true, and she hadn't realised it either. Yet again she wondered how this boy was working her up into being so out of control. It felt as though he had her in a constant state of arousal. 

 He guided her down the hall on hands and knees. Behind her she heard his zip, and looked over her shoulder. His cock sprang from his pants, and she licked her lips. Her master was going to mount her! 

 She felt his cock slide between her thighs, up into place, and enter with a determined thrust. She threw back her head, and howled like a wolf. 

 'Fuck me, Max. Make me your bitch. Oh! Max! I'm your dirty bitch, fuck me hard,' she howled. 

 He took longer to cum this time, as it hadn't been long since screwing her on the kitchen floor. He continued to thump his hips against her bare ass, listening to her pleading to be fucked. She had been a sensible married woman, though now she was his sexy plaything. 

 On finding out how susceptible she was to his demands, he determined to see how far he could push her. It hadn't occurred to him she would feel so obligated, and that she would be compliant to his demands. He was only just getting used to joining the adult world, with the resulting adult responsibilities. Having an older, married woman obey his demands was exciting. 

 When visiting her daughter, Chloe had been formal and came across as being old fashioned in her attitudes. The responsible and respectable woman was now his sexed up bitch. He continued to shove at her, swinging his hips back and forth, ramming his cock into her. He listened to her pathetic pleading to fuck her hard and fast, with a look of amusement. He hadn't expected this from such a straight-laced woman. 

 'Come on bitch, cum for your master! Tell me I'm your master,' he demanded. 

 He speeded up, thrusting deep and fast. 

 'Yes! Please, master. Don't stop now! Fuck your dirty bitch, master!' she shrilly pleaded. 

 On feeling him shove in deep and hold his cock still, she knew he was spurting potent semen into her vagina. She imagined him filling her up with strings of hot cum. Yet another orgasm rocked her back against him, pushing back to have it all. She shook her head from side to side. A squeak of joy squeezed from a constricted throat. Her head fell forward, leaving her ass up, with her vagina impaled upon his rock hard cock. She whimpered on feeling it shrivel from her pussy. 

 'Turn around, bitch,' he quietly spoke. 'Clean me up. Suck your master's cock,' he ordered. 

 She slurped at his cock, then sucked it into her mouth. No longer a distasteful chore, it was now an enjoyable privilege. She revelled at being on the end of his cock, serving her master. He pulled away, leaving her on the floor. She curled up into a foetal position, not wanting to move. She felt both excited and dirty over what happened with the pizza guy. The idea of being turned on from exhibiting her body was new to her. 

 This afternoon's adventures changed everything. She had conformed to his wishes, from being so financially dependent upon him. She had no money, and he owned the house, so she felt obliged to pay him back by looking after him. That involved being in his bed, pandering to his whims, and had to be endured. After these sexual adventures the relationship had drastically changed. She was now his willing sex toy, ready to obey whatever he wanted. 

 He helped her off with her clothes and guided her to the bathroom. Instead of a shower he was filling the bath. She stood by, ready to bathe her master like a dutiful servant. She watched him test the water temperature with an elbow, and smile. 

 'Get in,' he told her. 

 This was a surprise! She thought they were going to continue the masterful scene, with her bathing him. Instead he was going to bathe her. She sat in the bath watching him light candles, and mix scented bath oil into the water with his hand splashing around. 

 'Sit up,' he ordered. 

 She did as instructed for him to soap her back. He took his time, making it a gentle massage. Her arms and hands were next. Her neck, shoulders, then his hands slid down to her breasts, which were thoroughly attended to. He lifted a leg to lather it, while she lay supine, enjoying the feel of his hands and the hot water upon her flesh. He pushed a hand under her bottom, to soap between her cheeks. The other hand went over her belly, then slid firmly between her legs, finding her sex to massage every crevice. 

 She lay back in the hot water, immensely enjoying the sensual effect upon her emotions. She had a young attentive lover, and at that moment she was deeply in love with him. She parted her lips for a lingering kiss. 

 'You're mine, all mine,' he whispered. 

 'Yes, oh, yes,' she murmured. 

 'You belong to me now,' he firmly stated. 

 'Yes! I belong to you, my wonderful lover,' she responded. 

 'I own you,' he insisted. 

 'Yes, you own me, all of me,' she heavily sighed. 

 'I'm your master,' he said. 

 'Yes, master, I belong to you, master,' she heavily breathed. 

 It was true, he owned her. Materially, physically, and now mentally, he owned her right through to her very soul. Owning her made him her master. He had mastered her body, and mind. She was already committed to pleasing him, so the natural next step was to simply give in and obey him. 

 'You are my master. I will obey you in all things, master,' she promised. 

 Feeling his fingers enter her front and back, she began to orgasm. How many times today had he given her these explosive orgasms? It felt like she had been continuously climaxing, over and over, all day. Her body was weak, and her mind was mush. Whatever he wanted, she was willing to agree to, just anything at all. 

 During the rest of the weekend, she found herself surrendering to him completely. Max had already caught her in a web, like a helpless fly. She no longer struggled to escape. He had become overwhelmingly masterful, and gave her such delight, her single thought was to please him. She fussed around him, feeding him, willingly playing his games, trying her hardest to keep him happy.

 Monday morning found Chloe feeling nervous and apprehensive. Yesterday Max informed her she was to start work at his office. For the whole weekend he kept her on a high, so she fussed around him as though he were her lord and master. Under such intense conditioning, she could do nothing but agree with his decision. 

 Now she was wondering how she was going to cope. Not only with a first job since college, but also working with Max as her boss. He'd already taken her over completely at home, and now he would be her boss during office hours. 

 He dropped her off at a coffee shop, and parked the car a little further on, near the office. 

 'Hi Julie, had a good weekend?' he asked the office manager. 

 'Sure, you?' she asked. 

 'Very good. Remember I told you Friday, we have someone in this morning for an interview,' he reminded her. 

 'Do you want me to interview her. Miss Foster, isn't it.' she confirmed. 

 'I think that's the name. No, I'll do it. It's only for the position of office junior, but I want to check she will fit in with our team,' he smiled. 

 'Does this mean you're going to interview all the young girls,' she laughed. 

 'Sounds good, though dangerous,' he laughed back. 

 'If I think she's alright, you can go through the formalities,' he said, and walked over to the coffee machine. 

 'Oh! Thanks!' she quipped. 

 'You can be replaced you know,' he threw the remark over his shoulder. 

 'Do you think so?' she grimaced at his back. 

 'Maybe. If you can find someone intelligent, witty, with a great memory, able to manage awkward staff, understand our outmoded computer system, and can think on their feet in front of a client, then maybe, if I like them,' he seriously spoke. 

 'You give me all the easy tasks!' she lightly complained, sounding more relaxed and happy. 

 'I'd marry you to keep you in the family business, except I get the feeling you're looking for someone better,' he seriously told her. 

 'Let me think about it,' she laughed. 

 'OK. I know when I'm being let down gently,' he sighed, and disappeared into his office. 

 Julie stared at the boss's door for a moment. She wondered what he would say if she had answered differently. He sounded serious, yet the offer was always made during a humorous tease. It wouldn't usually be considered so seriously, only she was between boyfriends. Maybe the position of girlfriend should be considered, after that inconsiderate oaf of a boyfriend let her down recently. 

 Julie knocked on the boss's door, and opened it to introduce the expected applicant. She was a little old to be applying for an office junior's position. Maybe Max had been expecting an attractive young girl, but it didn't show on his face. 

 'Thank you, Julie,' he said. 

 Chloe nervously fidgeted with the skirt hem, as though trying to stretch it over her thighs. It was shorter than she was used to, even for a dinner party. In a professional office she felt self-conscious. It was almost as if she were really being interviewed for a job, especially after being brought into this office by the office manager. 

 That's how the girl had introduced herself, as Julie, the office manager. A quick and efficient way of putting her in place. The curious look the girl gave her became clear, when asked if she was here for the office junior position. Next to the attractive young woman, she felt old and vulnerable. Even for the lowest job in the office, she felt inadequate. 

 'No need to take a seat Miss Foster. Come around the desk, I want you to examine this document, very closely. Closer. Put both hands on the edge of the desk, and rest your nose on the document. Straighten your legs,' he ordered. 

 Chloe felt the skirt pulled up to reveal her upturned bottom. The sheer panties hid nothing of her cheeks, or much of her sex. They were impractical, without a proper cotton gusset, but her master had told her to wear them. He gripped the back of the panties, scrunched them up, and tugged them, so they were rolled between her cheeks. 

 Chloe wondered if this was how he wanted her to work in the office, bare assed. Bending down in the short skirt was going to be perilous. Not knowing what game he was playing with her, she kept quiet. As he would expect, she complied with his instructions, thinking there was little choice. 

 'What time does it say you were to present yourself here, in my office?' he meanly asked. 

 'At nine, sir,' she demurely spoke. 

 'This is for being two minutes late,' he sternly spoke. 

 She felt an unexpected swat upon her bottom, stinging, rather than hurting. It was a shock! How foolish she was for not anticipating it. There was no choice, she had to accept the job, and he was laying down the rules. He was to be her master at home, and now at work. 

 A second slap to her bottom was expected, and therefore seemed less of a sting. Maybe from expecting it, or it had been lighter. Her eyes were straining upward, examining the door, hoping no one entered while she was being spanked by the boss. A third and fourth slap to her bare bottom came quickly, one after the other. 

 'Stand up. No, leave the dress. What do you say?' he sternly demanded. 

 They had played this game before, so she tried hard to recall what he expected. There was no need to try and look chastened. She felt like a naughty schoolgirl, standing before a harsh headmaster after a caning. 

 'Sorry for being late, sir. Thank you for spanking me, sir. Your slave promises to be obedient in future, master,' she humbly spoke. 

 'Good girl. Let's see if you can fulfil your duties. Under the desk with you, girl,' he heavily spoke. 

 Although submitting over the weekend where she obeyed his every whim, she hesitated. 

 'What if someone comes in, sir?' she asked, with a tremulous voice. 

 'You'll have to keep very quiet. I don't want you making a mess of my suit trousers, girl, so make sure you swallow it all. Quickly, girl,' he encouraged. 

 Without another word she hurriedly knelt and crawled into the desk well. Carefully removing his cock she fumbled it, from feeling tense. This was different from handling his cock at home. They had made love in almost every room of the house, and now here, in his office. She just hoped no one came in and found her sucking off the boss. 

 Chloe kissed the end of his cock, wanting to get into the usual routine, and forget where she was. Concentrating on pleasing her boss, she sucked it into her mouth, feeling his anticipation of her engulfing his cock, making him hard. It was pleasing that he was ready, just from the thought of her using new found skills. 

 He looked under the desk, watching her full rosebud lips, suck the end of his cock. The feel of her luscious lips on the head of his cock was almost as good as the sight of it being sucked. 

 Wendy hadn't been a girlfriend exactly, though they fumbled around on occasion. Now her mother was on her knees, giving him a bow job. Not wanting to take her for granted he reminded himself this was a mature, married woman, trying hard to please him. What a contrast with the sensible, conventional woman he knew a few weeks ago. It hadn't taken long for her refined and moral behaviour to evaporate, leaving in its place a willing sex toy. 

 Her eyes flickered up at him, with a look of happiness glinting in them. She couldn't take her eyes away from her master. When he started to spurt his load into her mouth, she massaged his balls, intending to make sure she sucked him dry. She didn't want to be punished for making a mess on his pants. He continued to watch her, perhaps to make sure she performed her task correctly. 

 When his cock shrank she let it go. It was clean, so she tucked it back into his trousers. She opened her mouth, showing him a dollop of sperm on her tongue, and waited for permission to swallow her master's precious fluid. At his feet waiting for permission to swallow cum, this abject state she'd sunk to struck hard. She was nothing more than an appendage to her master's cock! That wasn't what made her wince, it was that she accepted the dismal position. 

 'Swallow, slave,' he smiled at her. 

 The lowly position was hammered home when she swallowed, and felt grateful for his approval. 

 Before leaving his office she straightened the skirt, not daring to pull her panties from between her cheeks. She hadn't been told to. 

 'Max told me to report to you, Julie,' Chloe quietly spoke. 

 It should have been embarrassing, reporting to an attractive twenty year old. Julie was the office manager, and would be her boss, for she was too humble an employee to have Max as her boss. Besides, what did she know about working here, or anywhere. 

 Julie sat next to her going through a mundane task. Something simple enough to be given to the new recruit. The woman kept fidgeted with the hem, and the low cut blouse. Had she worn the slutty clothes to impress the boss, just to get the job? It would explain why she felt uncomfortable in them. 

 She had to show the new office junior how to operate the photocopier, and every other device in the office. Surely the woman had worked before, so her ignorance meant she was stupid. It was difficult to suppress disdain for the poor thing. At least there was no chance of being replaced by this pathetic specimen. 

 Chloe felt awful. The young girl was treating her like a dumb blond. Though, this was better than being given tasks out of her comfort zone. Not having to work before, she was ignorant of office practices. 

 Next day she made sure she was on time, not wanting to risk a spanking from the boss. Allowed to wear a longer dress by her master was appreciated. Given a box of confidential papers she began the boring process of shredding them. In a daydream she fed the papers in several at a time. A long computer printout was next, and she let her concentration wander. 

 'Oh! Shit!' Chloe exclaimed. 

 The hem of the dress was being pulled into the machine. Pulling at it was no good, as it had a firm grip of the material, and was gradually pulling her closer. The dress covered the buttons, and she didn't want to press the fast mode. She reached for the wall, intending to pull the plug.

Leaning over the machine she felt the front of the dress pulled further into the shredder, until there was no slack. Falling away, she sank onto her knees, with the dress dragging up her body, and over her head. Flailing for a grip on it did no good. There was nothing left but a tongue of material, then that too disappeared into the sharp teeth of the shredder. She watched shreds of cotton spewing out into the bin. Her dress was shredded into strands, impossible to recover. 

 'You all right?' Julie asked, then burst out laughing. 

 Chloe stood before her supervisor, in bra, panties, stockings, suspenders and a pair of heels. The situation left her feeling so very stupid, she just stood there mumbling. 

 'You really are a dumb blond,' Julie laughed. 

 'Yes, ma'am,' Chloe shyly answered. 

 'You can't go around like that, or can you?' Julie asked, sounding amused. 

 Chloe wondered what to do. She had no money, nothing at all. She didn't even have the bus fare home, and certainly not enough to buy a dress. The other two in the office came around to see what the fuss was. 

 'Nice underwear,' Nelly commented, while trying not to laugh. 

 'What you going to do, girl?' Samantha asked. 

 'I don't know!' Chloe said, looking pathetic. 

 'Go see the boss, he'll know what to do with you,' Julie said. 

 She was only joking, and was surprised to see the woman walk toward his office. She looked at the others, and they smirked back at her. 

 'Is she trying for your job?' Samantha asked, 

 'Not likely, no way,' she said. 

 They watched Chloe nervously tap at the door, then walk in. They looked at each other with curious glances. Getting on with their work, they tried not to wonder what he was doing with her. She was an attractive woman. A bit dumb, but men tended to like that. 

 Julie was furious. She sat at her desk with arms folded counting the seconds that woman was in there. If she came between them she would put a stop to her game. 

 Chloe leant over the bosses desk receiving a spanking. He was more amused than angry, and only lightly slapped her cheeks. The whole office had seen her in the flimsy underwear, and now she was being spanked by the boss. It made her think over how she had got into this mess. 

 Her husband had left her, leaving bills, and an unpaid mortgage. Her daughter's boyfriend felt sorry for her, and took over all the bills and mortgage. He owned the house and all her debts. She felt as though he owned her, and that she had to please him. They were pleasuring each other and more than she had ever experienced. 

 Yes, it was worth a little discomfort and loss of dignity. He was an attentive lover, and kept her so very happy. She stood before him with hands at her sides and a chastened look on her face. 

 'Thank you for spanking me, master. I've been a stupid slave, and needed spanking, master,' she solemnly spoke. 

 She looked at him, and they burst out laughing. 

 'Stop it, Max. I'm supposed to be your slave girl!' she complained. 

 'After that stupid mistake, you'll have to be my dim-witted bimbo in the office,' he laughed. 

 'If that's what my master wants, slave shall obey,' she said, trying to regain the atmosphere, but failing. 

 'What am I going to do?' she asked. 

 'I'll send Julie out for clothes. You'll have to remain here out of the way until she returns,' he smiled. 

 'What are you going to do with me?' she asked, giving him a coquettish look. 

 'Anything I like. You might like it too, or you might not,' he smiled. 

 He walked up to Julie who was glaring at him. 

 'Do you mind going shopping? This should cover it. I had a word with her about health and safety, and being careful,' he said. 

 She didn't believe a word. She snatched the notes off the desk, picked up her bag, and walked out without saying a word. 

 Max walked around the office not sure what to do. He was tempted to stay out of his office until Julie got back. He liked her, but his father had warned him about playing around with office staff. 

 'I'm going out to visit a client,' he said, and left the office. Report_Story
