 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© The lights were off and I sat on the couch in the dark living room and stared at the opposite wall and wondered how it could possibly have happened to me. I had always thought of myself as a man. Truth be told, and I admit to some ego here, I would have considered myself a 'manly man.' As a middle linebacker I made All State in my junior and senior years in high school. As a wrestler I was undefeated in my weight class three years running. I engaged in and was good at manly pursuits like hunting, fishing, rafting, bowling, golf and I was one hell of a good poker player. 

 Not having the money for college I joined the Army right out of high school to learn a trade and take advantage of the Army's educational opportunities and at the end of my three year enlistment I returned home with knowledge of computers, a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. So yes, all in all I did consider myself a man. At least I did until a five foot one inch one hundred and five pound woman reduced my six foot two inch two hundred and ten pound self to ashes. 

 ++++++++++++ 

 I met Gail Sue three weeks after getting home from the Army. I spent the first two weeks looking for a part time job that would allow me to take afternoon and evening classes at the college and doing all of the things necessary to get admitted and sign up for classes. 

 Those things taken care of I went looking for an apartment that would be close to work and to school. I found an apartment complex that was in the perfect location for me and when I walked into the leasing office I saw the most beautiful girl in the world sitting behind the desk. The name plate on the desk said that her name was Gail Sue Marshall. Long red hair that fell below her shoulders framed the face of an angel. Her voice, low and throaty, curled my toes when she said: 

 "May I help you?" 

 I told her I was looking for an apartment and asked if they had any vacancies. She told me that they did and what was available and what the monthly rates were and then she explained the ins and outs of the lease agreement. She told me that I would need to put up the first and last months rent and a security deposit. When I didn't flinch at any of the numbers she asked me if I would like to see the units that were available and when I said yes she stood up from behind her desk and reached for a ring of keys hanging on a hook behind her. The rest of her went perfectly with the angelic face and the red hair. I glanced quickly at her left hand and noticed that she wasn't wearing any rings. 

 We certainly made an odd looking couple as we walked through the apartment complex. My 6'2" body towered over her 5'1" and she had to tilt her head back to look up and talk to me. The first one bedroom she looked at was too small for me and I told her that unless she had larger one bedroom units we should start looking at two bedroom units. 

 I picked out a nice one overlooking the pool and she asked me if I was going to have a roommate. I told her that I wasn't planning on it and then I asked her why she'd asked. She said that it just seemed odd that a single guy would take on the expense of a two bedroom. I told her that I was a student at college and I was going to use the second bedroom as a home office or den. I told her that I would probably entertain occasionally and I didn't want to give up space in the living room, dining room and kitchen area for a desk, computer and tables to hold printer, flat bed scanner, books and whatever else. 

 She told me that she took night classes at the college and asked me what my major was and we got to discussing school and schedules as we walked back to the office so I could sign the lease agreement. As I left the office I told her that I would see her around and she said: 

 "I certainly hope so." 

 At that my ears perked up and I wondered if she was just being polite or would maybe welcome my attentions. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 The next week was a busy one for me as I ran around buying furniture and all the other things I needed to set up the apartment. I was in Wal-Mart buying a set of pots and pans when a voice behind me said: 

 "How's the move in coming?" 

 I turned and saw Gail Sue standing there. "Kind of slow" I said. "I've never been on my own before so I've no idea of all that I really need. I'm forever finding something that I just have to have and back down here I come. It is too bad that Wally World does not give frequent flyer miles. I could have had a trip to Europe by now." 

 "Maybe I can help. Got time for a cup of coffee?" 

 I said that I did and after I had checked out we went next door to the Starbucks. When we sat down she took a pad and pen out of her hand bag and started writing on it. After a couple of minutes she slid the pad across the table to me and told me that it was the bare minimum that I should have to start with. I looked at the list and then took out my pen and crossed out all the things I already had and then I tore the sheet off the pad and put it in my pocket as I said: 

 "I can see that it is back to Wal-Mart for me." 

 "Do you know what to do with those pots and pans you bought today?" 

 "Pretty much. My mom taught all of us kids how to cook and then since she and dad both worked the three of us kids had to take turns doing the meals during the week and mom did the weekends." 

 "What is your specialty?" 

 "My specialty?" 

 "Sure. Everyone who cooks has something that they think is really good and they make it more often than anything else they do." 

 "I guess it would be my meat loaf." 

 "When do I get to try it?" 

 No way was I going to let an opening like that go by so I asked her if she were free that night. 

 I served a nice Merlot with the meatloaf, baked potato and French style green beans and when dinner was over we sat there, sipped the wine and got to know each other better. She was an only child and her parents were divorced. Following the divorce her father moved to California and her only contact with him was a phone call on her birthday and a Christmas card with a check in it. Her mother remarried and moved to Atlanta and they talked on the phone twice a week. She couldn't afford to go to school full time and work part time so she worked full time and went to school part time. She liked her job and one of the reasons was that she got an employee discount on her one bedroom apartment. 

 I told her about growing up on a farm with an older sister and a younger brother and how my mom raised the three of us after my father was killed in an auto accident. I told her my goal was a degree in Electrical Engineering and she told me she was after a degree in Interior Design. When it was time for her to go I asked her if she would like to try my Linguini Alfredo she said she would love to. 

 "How about Friday at seven?" 

 "It's a date." 

 Friday night was a repeat of Tuesday in that after we ate we sat, sipped wine and talked. I enjoyed her company very much. She was intelligent, had a great sense of humor and it was a joy just to sit and look at her. 

 On Monday and Wednesday we both had an evening class that ran from seven until eight-thirty so we met after class at a local pub for a drink and the third time we did that I asked her for a "real date." 

 "A real date?" 

 "Yeah, you know, dinner and then a movie or maybe drinks and dancing." 

 "Definitely drinks and dancing. When?" 

 "How about this Saturday?" 

 "What time?" 

 "Will six work for you?" 

 She was a dream to dance with and we spent a lot of time out on the dance floor. We had been there about two hours and were out on the dance floor moving together to a fairly slow number. I can still remember it - "Nights in White Satin" - and Gail reached up and pulled my head down and kissed me. I was so surprised that it was a second or so before I woke up and kissed her back. She broke the kiss and tucked in close to me and after the song ended we went back to our booth where instead of sitting across from me she slid in beside me and held my hand while we kissed again. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 After that night we were a couple,. We dated all through my freshman year and into the middle of my sophomore year. After we had been dating for about four months she asked me why I had not made a move on her of a sexual nature. We had kissed a lot and some of our necking sessions had been pretty heated. 

 "But you have never tried to put your hands on my breasts or run a hand up my leg or do anything that a girl expects a guy to try." 

 "It wouldn't be fair of me to do any of that." 

 "How would it not be fair?" 

 "It would get you worked up to no end. I promised my mother I would go to my wedding bed a virgin." 

 "You are twenty-two and still a virgin?" 

 "Yes I am." 

 "Oh wow. I don't believe it. A twenty-two year old girl maybe, but not a guy." 

 "It hasn't been easy. Back in high school I almost succumbed a couple of times. That's how I know about getting worked up and why I'm avoiding doing it with you." 

 Gail had looked at me for several seconds before saying, "Are you going to expect your bride to be a virgin also?" 

 I chuckled and then said, "Not unless she promised my mother she would be. No honey, it would be nice, but it would not be a requirement." 

 I thought I saw relief in her eyes and then she said, "You have never mentioned it, but do we have a future?" 

 "I hope so." 

 "Then why haven't you asked me to marry you?" 

 "I won't get married until I get college out of the way and that is a long time to ask a girl to wait around. I figured that if I asked you and you said yes it would lock you in and I didn't want to do that to you. My thought was that if we were still a couple when my degree was in sight it would mean that we would be good for the long haul." 

 "The long haul?" 

 "Yes honey, the long haul. To me marriage is forever. 

 "So what you are saying is that you think between now and when you graduate I'm going to go and find another guy?" 

 "What I am saying is that I'm three and a half years away from graduation and I want you to be free to make sure that you are sure of what you want." 

 "In other words I'm free to date others to make sure that the one I really want is you." 

 "That pretty much sums it up." 

 "Guys can be so dense sometimes. Can we go looking for a ring tomorrow?" 

 We found one she liked the next day and I went to my knees and proposed, she said yes and I slipped the ring on her finger. 

 A week later she called me on the phone and told me that her mother had been in a bad accident and she had to fly to Atlanta. She told me she didn't know how long she would be gone, but that she would call me as soon as she got there and found out more of what was going on. She called me the next day and told me that it would be a while before she would be able to come back. Both her mother and her stepfather were hurt pretty badly and she was going to have to stay with them until they were back on their feet. She was gone almost eight months. We talked two or three times a week and when the term ended in June I told her I would take a week off of work and fly to Atlanta to visit, but she talked me out of it. She said it would be a waste of money since she couldn't get away to spend any time with me. We talked on the phone weekly and her visit to Atlanta seemed to stretch out longer and longer. There were some rehab issues is what she told me. 

 I decided to accelerate things and I took summer classes to speed things up so I didn't have the opportunity to offer to fly to Atlanta to see her. I was one month into my senior year when she came back. Her timing was just right and she was able to get her old job back. The girl who had replaced her was getting married and moving. Gail re-enrolled and got on with her classes. 

 Graduation was fast approaching and we made plans to be married in a civil ceremony with just a couple of close friends present. One week before the ceremony Gail Sue sat me down for a little talk. 

 "Before you marry me honey, there are some things about me that you should know. The first is that I am not a virgin. In fact, I am a long way from being a virgin. I've had sex with at least two dozen guys and one of them got me pregnant. My mother's so called accident never happened. I went to Atlanta to go through my pregnancy, have the baby and then give it up for adoption. I like sex and I have been seeing guys for as long as I have known you. The last one was in Atlanta the day the doctor cleared me to have sexual relations again. I saw him for the six months that it took me to lose the extra weight I gained during my pregnancy and to get back into the same shape I was when you last saw me. He was the last one honey. I made up my mind before I left Atlanta that you were the one I wanted to spend my life with. You need to know all of this now before you marry me. If you want to back out now I'll understand." 

 "What you did before is none of my business. I don't have an exclusive claim on you until you say "I do." I'm not backing out of anything." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 I thought that our honeymoon started out as disaster, but Gail convinced me that my quick ejaculations were normal for a virgin and that I would eventually gain some staying power. Thank God she was right. 

 For a while there I hated my mother for making me promise to stay a virgin until I married. I thought back to all the chances I'd had in high school to have that much enjoyment and had to pass on because of that promise and I wanted to strangle her. I just loved the hell out of making love and when I got home from work Gail Sue knew that dinner on the table waiting was the furthest thing from my mind. 

 We had been married about four months when the first crack appeared in the marriage. I was licking Gail's nipples when she put her hands on my head and gently pushed it downward. She had a sensitive belly button and I thought she wanted me to kiss it and lick it so I kissed and licked my way down her stomach until I got to her "innie", but she kept the pressure on my head and when my nose hit her pussy hairs I raised my head and asked her what she was doing. 

 "I want you to kiss my pussy lover. I want you to lick my pussy and suck on my clit." 

 "Are you out of your mind? Why would I want to do some as disgusting as that?" 

 "How can you call it disgusting if you don't try it?" 

 "What the hell is wrong with you Gail Sue? You pee out of that hole." 

 "That doesn't keep you from putting your cock in it." 

 "There is a big difference between my cock and my mouth Gail Sue. My dick can't taste and my mouth can." 

 "Oh for God's sake Robbie; men have been eating pussy for a thousand years and no one has ever died from it. It gives a woman pleasure. Come on honey, give it a try." 

 "No Gail Sue. I will not put my mouth on that!" 

 I moved up to mount her and she moved out from under me. I asked her what she was doing and she told me that she wasn't in the mood any more. Things were kind of chilly in the house for the next week. Every time I tried to initiate love making Gail would have an excuse as to why she couldn't. She had a headache or a backache or she was too tired and then her monthly came along. 

 I wasn't stupid. I knew that she was withholding sex to punish me for not doing what she wanted me to do. I also knew than even though she was depriving me she was depriving herself. Well, she pissed me off! When her period was over and she was over her 'hissy fit' and ready to get it on it was my turn to have headaches and backaches and to be too tired. She made me go for nine days without so I made her go for twelve. True, I was hurting myself, but some times you just have to make your point. 

 Gail Sue was not stupid either and she knew just what I was doing. She knew that I was getting back at her and I knew that she was suffering a lot more than I had. I was new to sex and although I loved it I had not yet gotten to the point where I was used to it on a regular basis. By her own admission she liked sex a lot and had been doing it for years so a lack of sex had to hurt her more than it hurt me. That was going to be the way of it from then on. If she withheld sex from me she could count on my responding in kind with interest. Nothing was said between us, but Gail Sue knew what the rules were going to be from then on. On the thirteenth day when she reached for my cock I let it happen and for the next several months it was as if nothing had happened. 

 And then the crack that had started with the pussy eating incident grew wider. One morning I woke up thinking I was waking up from a wet dream only to find that Gail Sue had my dick in her mouth. I jerked away from her. 

 "God damn it Gail Sue, just what is wrong with you? How can you even think of doing something as disgusting as that?" 

 "Most men like it Robbie." 

 "I don't care what a bunch of degenerates like and dislike. You know what my stance is on the subject Gail Sue now leave it be!" 

 For the next four months she kept arguing with me and trying to talk me into trying it just once, but I was adamant that it was too disgusting to talk about, let alone happen. 

 There were some other disagreements along the way. She wanted me to fuck her like a dog. She wanted to sit on top of me and do the work. Not only did she want to sit on top, but she wanted to sit on top backwards! She did not take my refusal to do any of those things well. She never withheld sex - she had learned her lesson there - but she did constantly argue with me and berate me for not at least trying any of those degenerate acts. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was the week before our wedding anniversary. I came home and almost tripped over the suitcases that were stacked by the front door. Gail Sue was in the kitchen and as I walked into the room she said: 

 "I'll cut right to the chase Rob. I'm leaving you. I've been to the bank and I withdrew half of what we had and I've had myself removed from all of our credit cards. You can use whatever grounds you feel like in the divorce. I'm sorry that things didn't work out Rob. Hopefully your next wife will be more in tune with you." 

 She started to get up and I asked, "Don't I even get to know why?" 

 "Does it matter?" 

 "It does to me." 

 "You won't like it." 

 "I don't like the fact that you are leaving me, but you are doing it anyway." 

 "You are no good in bed Rob. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. I'm a very sexual person. I like sex and I like it in all of its various forms and I don't get it from you." 

 "You've never complained before." 

 "I complain all the time Rob, but you never listen. I like oral sex, both giving and getting and I like making love in positions other than the missionary. I love anal sex Rob. I've never mentioned anal to you since you always go ballistic when I bring up oral, but that's the bottom line Rob. You are just not getting the job done for me in the bedroom." 

 "That's it? You are throwing our marriage away over something that makes up...what?...five percent of the marriage?" 

 "That's the problem Rob. It is only five percent to you, but it is more like forty or even fifty percent for me. It is more my fault than yours. I never should have married you." 

 "I thought you loved me." 

 "I did. I still do. But given my sexual nature I should have made sure that we were sexually compatible before marrying you. What I did was the equivalent of answering an ad in the paper for a used car and buying it without checking under the hood or taking it for a test drive. But I was in love and I thought that it was cute and charming that you were keeping a promise to your mother by staying a virgin. In all other respects except for the bedroom Rob, you are a great husband. It is just unfortunate for us that I need the bedroom part as much as I need the other parts. The thing I really couldn't understand is your insistence on only using the missionary position. You seemed to enjoy the hell out of making love so why did you limit yourself to the missionary?"  

 

 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "The others are not natural." 

 "Not natural?" 

 "That's right, not natural. With you on top my sperm would flow back towards me. With me on top the sperm would fall deeper into you and have a better chance to get to your eggs." 

 "So for you it was all about getting me pregnant? Did you ever stop to think that having kids is a decision that needs to be made by both parties? Why didn't you talk to me about that?" 

 "What was there to talk about? People get married and raise families. It's the way of things." 

 "Not with me it isn't. I've already had one baby and after going through it I am in no hurry to have another one. If you had gotten me pregnant it would have been a miracle. I'm on birth control pills and I back them up with a diaphragm just to make damned sure that I don't get pregnant." 

 "You were deliberately denying me my chance to be a father?" 

 "Damned right I was. It is my body that has to do all the work and suffer the pain so it is going to be me who decides if and when I'm going to have a baby and you would have known that if you would have talked to me. You are a nice guy Rob and you will make the right girl a good husband, but the right girl is going to have to be a virgin and be naive as hell to go along with your idea of a love life." 

 She stood up and said, "I'll let you know where I'm staying when I find a place so you will know where to send the divorce papers." 

 She started to leave the room and then stopped. "This isn't easy for me Rob because I do love you, but there is more to a marriage than just love." 

 I must have sat there staring at nothing in particular for an hour after she had gone. She had hit me where I was the most vulnerable - my maleness! "You are no good in bed" she had said. She told me I wasn't a man. 

 To be continuedâ¦  

 

 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I managed to get through the next four or five days without coming unglued and then one night I got a phone call from my mother. 

 "How have you been sweetie? I haven't heard from you all week." 

 "Not good momma. Gail walked out on me." 

 "When did she do that?" 

 "Last Tuesday." 

 "What in the world happened?" 

 "I don't want to go into it momma. It is kind of personal." 

 "You didn't go messing around behind her back did you?" 

 "Damn it momma, you know me better than that!" 

 "Well it had to be something bad like that to make that girl leave you." 

 "Sorry momma, but it is just too personal to talk about." 

 "Are you going to be all right?" 

 "I'll manage momma." 

 "Well you keep in better touch now, you hear?" 

 "Yes momma." 

 Forty minutes after I hung up the phone the door bell rang and when I went to the door I found my mother standing there. She pushed past me and went straight to the kitchen and sat down. 

 "Now" she said, "I want to know exactly what happened." 

 When I finished my story she sat back, looked at me and said, "I guess I didn't do as good a job of raising you as I thought I did. Where did you get all of them fool notions you got in your head?" 

 "A lot of it came from you momma, from overhearing what you told Alice." 

 "Girls are different from boys Rob and they get different words than boys do. For one thing, I never expected you to keep your promise to me to stay a virgin until you got married. All I was trying to do was get you out of high school without you getting some poor girl pregnant and ruining both of your lives. And where did you get your ideas on making love? No wonder the poor girl gave up on you." 

 "Only whores and sluts would do what she wanted to do." 

 "Am I a whore? Am I a slut? Your daddy and I did every bit of what Gail Sue said she wanted and then some. Nothing at all wrong with any of it. Making love is all about two people giving each other pleasure and whatever gives two people pleasure is a good thing. I just can't believe that you let that girl get away over something so dumb. You need to do whatever you have to do to get her back." 

 "No momma, I don't think so. She chose to leave. I'm not happy about it, but she wanted out so bad that she didn't even waste a second sitting down and talking about it and at least giving me a chance to make a choice. It was "I'm not getting what I want so I'm out of here." What would it be next time? You won't let me paint the bedroom walls purple so I'm leaving?" 

 "Honey, you are letting your pride do the talking instead of your head and your heart." 

 "That might be momma, but she chose to walk so she's gone." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Gail Sue called four days after she walked out and left a message on the answering machine giving me her new address and phone number. I wrote them down, dropped them in the drawer and forgot about them. I was in a funk for a couple of days, but I gradually came out of it. 

 Being a reasonably healthy young man who was used to making love I got to missing it and I began to look around. In fact, there were several good looking women right in the same office where I worked and four of them were single, but strangely enough it was the two married women who interested me the most. 

 But married or single there was one thing that I needed to take care of first. I saw an attorney who specialized in divorce actions and he drew up the papers for the divorce using irreconcilable differences as grounds. I gave him the address that Gail had given me and he said he would take care of things and three days later I was told that she had been served. That night as I was fixing my super I got a call from Gail. 

 "I got the papers today." 

 I didn't say anything and she said, "I didn't think you would do it." 

 "That's a strange thing to say. It is what you said you wanted and not just once, but three times as I recall it. First you told me to divorce you on whatever grounds I felt like and then, after spending ten minutes trashing me and telling me how worthless I was, you told me you would let me know where I could send the papers and three days later you called and left a message on the answering machine and as I remember it your exact words were: 

 "You can send the divorce papers to me here. You were pretty clear in what you wanted Gail Sue." 

 "I guess I was, wasn't I. Goodbye Rob." 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 The day after I filed I went by the Human Resources office to find out what I needed to do as far as things like insurance and withholding were concerned and they advised me not to change anything until after the divorce was final. 

 I wasn't sure of the legalities, but I wasn't worried about them either. I was still legally married and would be until the divorce was granted so technically anything I did with another woman would be adultery, but as far as I was concerned so what? Gail Sue had relinquished all claim to me when she walked out and I had done the same to her when I served her with divorce papers. And, given her big speech about her being such a sexual person and what her sexual needs were (and remembering what she had told me about her past) I'd no doubt she was already getting them taken care of. I figured that released me to go out and do the same. 

 I'd already noticed the girls I worked with, but they all knew that I was married and I didn't know how to go about getting around it. Somehow I didn't think that going up to one and saying, "Hi Mary, I'm getting divorced. Want to go out?" would work all that well so I sat down and started making out a list of places I could go to meet women. I had a list of about fourteen places, but before I could start investigating the possibilities something I never would have expected happened. 

 I was sitting in the break room having a cup of coffee when Katrina came over to the table I was sitting at and sat down across from me. After some small talk she said: 

 "A little birdie tells me that you are a free man again." 

 "A little birdie?" 

 "Veronica in Human Resources. Is it true? Are you back in circulation?" 

 "Yes and no." 

 "What kind of an answer is that?" 

 "I'm not really free yet. I won't really be free until the divorce is final." 

 "That's just a technicality. You are separated and not living together, right?" 

 "Right." 

 "Then you are free and back on the market. Anyway, what it is is that we want you to stop with us at Stanley's tonight after work. We stop every Wednesday night and you have never joined us before." 

 "We?" 

 "The other girls and me. I'll warn you ahead of time that there is going to be some friendly competition between us to see who can date you first." 

 I had nothing else planned so I told her that I would stop. 

 "Good. Since I am the one they talked into talking with you I get to have the first dance, okay?" 

 As she walked away I pondered on what she had told me. A friendly competition to see who could date me first? I didn't know who was in the competition besides Katrina, but the fact that it was more than one was a hell of a nice stroke for my ego and God knows that after the way Gail had trashed it my ego really needed a stroke or two. 

 When I got there there were already eleven people sitting around three tables that had been pushed together next to the dance floor. From my office there was Katrina and three of the other single girls, both of the married girls and Brandon and Kevin. Brenda from Accounting was there, Veronica from Human Resources and Dave from Quality Control. Katrina pulled me down on a chair next to her and filled me in on the way things were done. The band only played Thursday through Saturday so on Wednesday they had to make do with the juke box. The guys all kicked in five bucks each and the money was used to keep the juke box pounding away. The guys paid and the girls picked the music. The guys were expected to keep the girls on the dance floor. No shop talk and no guys getting their heads together to talk cars, sports or any of the like. If we wanted to do that we could stop in for drinks on some other night and do it. Wednesday was strictly for music, dancing and, she said in a low voice, flirting. When she said that I quickly looked at Joyce and Brenda, the two married women (every one else there was single or in my case, working on it). 

 Katrina caught my glance and she giggled as she said, "Hey, they are only human." 

 I tossed my five on the table and Katrina picked it up and went over to the bar and then came back with a handful of quarters which she dropped in a tall plastic cup in the center of the table. She kept a few of them in her hand and used her other hand to pull me along behind her as she walked over to the juke box. She fed the money into it, pushed some buttons and then led me out onto the dance floor. As the music started she moved into me and as we started moving to the music she said: 

 "I know I'm being pushy and forward, but the other girls are just as interested in you as I am so I'm doing what I have to do to be first in line." 

 "Interested? In me?" 

 "Honey, we all had the hots for you when you came to work here. And we were all crushed when we learned that you were already married. Now you aren't and like I said, I want to be the first in line. Again, I do know that I'm being pushy, but there are some things that I would like to know." 

 "Like what?" 

 "Is your breaking up too recent for you to want to date?" 

 "No, not really. I'd pretty much made up my mind to start looking." 

 "Next question. How do you feel about pushy girls?" 

 "I guess I'd have to say that as long as they are pushing me in a direction I'd probably like to go anyway I could probably tolerate them." 

 The tunes being played were slow ones and Katrina had moved in pretty close. She was a very nice armful and I had an erection and I know she felt it. She didn't say anything, but she did press into it a time or two. 

 "Next question. How do you feel about a girl who kisses on the first date?" 

 "I guess that would depend on whether or not she is a good kisser." 

 "Do you always have to be the one to ask for a date or can a girl ask you for a date?" 

 "It wouldn't matter as long as it was a girl that I wanted to date." 

 "Well, I did ask you to join us and you did come so I'm going to consider this our first date" and she pulled my head down and kissed me on the mouth. I felt just a small flick of her tongue against my lips before she pulled away and said, "Would you like to have dinner with me Friday and maybe catch a movie?" 

 "I think that I would like that very much." 

 The juke box ran dry and we walked back to the table. I still hadn't ordered a drink and while I was trying to catch the waitresses attention Veronica took some change out of the cup in the center of the table and pulled me up out of my seat and led me over to the juke box. As we danced she said: 

 "I guess I screwed up in letting the word of your divorce get out. If I would have kept my mouth shut I could have been the first one to get you out here on the dance floor." 

 "Why would you have wanted to do that?" 

 "To be honest I don't really know. There is just something about you that appeals to me. And not just me; the other girls feel it too. Right now they are all wanting to scratch Kat's eyes out which isn't really fair since they are the ones who talked her into approaching you." 

 "I just don't understand the interest in me. I'm nothing special. God knows that my about-to-be ex didn't see anything special in me. And why me when Bruce, Kevin and Dave are single and apparently available?" 

 "Bruce and Dave are confirmed bachelors and are only interested in one night stands and Kevin is a bit too crude for most of the girls. Pam seems to get along okay with him, but Pam is a no nonsense type and she won't put up with any of his crap. The big question for all of us single ladies is when do you think that the trauma of your breakup will have eased enough for you to consider dating again." 

 "I'd say about ten minutes ago. I'm having dinner with Katrina Friday night." 

 "The girls will love hearing that. They have been talking for two days now about who was going to get to you first." 

 After Veronica I danced with Dorothy, Pam, Brenda and Aggie and they all let me know in subtle ways that they would be receptive if I'd like to ask them out. The surprise of the evening, at least for me, was that Marge - one of the two married women (Alice was the other) who worked in my office - let me know that she wouldn't mind my attentions. Actually she was quite blunt about it. 

 "Now that you are on the market maybe we can get together some night and have some fun." 

 "I thought you were married?" 

 "I am, but so what?" 

 I didn't know what to say to that so I pulled her close and danced. Not a good move on my part as Marge was the sexiest looking woman in the office and that had provoked the expected reaction and I pulled her right into it. She giggled and said: 

 "I guess not all of you is opposed to the idea. I'd like to do it tonight, but I have to pick the kids up from the sitter's. I'll make other arrangements for next Wednesday. Think you can wait that long for me?" 

 By then I had managed to get my act a bit together and I said, "I'll try. Just then the song ended and she reached up and patted my cheek and said, "Until next week then." 

 The group started breaking up around eight. Alice had gone home a little after seven, but everyone else hung around for another hour and then they started leaving and soon it was just Veronica and me sitting there. The juke box started playing a slow number and Roni said, "Time for one more and she led me out onto the dance floor. As we danced she asked: 

 "Do you need to hurry home for anything?" 

 "No, not really." 

 "Want to stop for coffee when we leave here?" 

 "I could. A cup or two could dilute the alcohol in my system." 

 When the tune ended we headed for the parking lot and she told me to follow her. I followed her as she drove by at least six places where we could have stopped for coffee and then she finally pulled into an apartment complex parking lot. She got out of her car and waited for me to park and get out of my car. She saw the look on my face as I walked up to her and she said: 

 "I guess I should have said a cup of coffee at my place instead of just saying stop for a cup of coffee. We can always go back down the street to the Waffle House if you would rather." 

 "That's not necessary. We are already here. I followed Roni to her apartment and she pointed at a couch and told me to have a seat while she put on the coffee. I was thumbing through one of the magazines on her coffee table when I heard her say: 

 "What is it that the flight attendants say? Coffee, tea or me?" 

 I looked up from the copy of Newsweek I'd been looking at and saw Roni standing there clad only in a pair of high heeled pumps. I was a little on the stunned side since nothing like that had ever even remotely happened to me, but I wasn't stupid so I stood up and gave her the only answer that I could - I started undressing. As soon as I was naked Roni led me into her bedroom and got on the bed. She spread her legs wide and said: 

 "I've been planning this since the minute you walked into the bar tonight. I'm wet and I'm ready. No foreplay lover; just get on the bed and fuck me." 

 I got on the bed and moved between her legs and she reached down and took hold of my cock and lined it up and then said, "Push lover, push hard." 

 I pressed forward and she moaned and then she clutched the cheeks of my ass and tried to pull me into her. It took a couple of pushes to get all of me in (I'm not big, she was just that tight) and then she moaned: 

 "Do it, do it, fuck me hard, fuck me hard lover, fuck me hard." 

 I did my best and it was good enough to give her an orgasm before I felt the need to let myself go. I pulled out of her and came on her stomach and then I rolled over on my side. 

 "Why did you do that?" 

 "Do what?" 

 "Pull out and shoot on my tummy." 

 "I was there and I would have gone off in the time it would have taken me to ask you if you were protected so I did the safe thing and pulled out." 

 "Well that was nice of you, but you didn't have to because I am protected so next time give me the full experience." 

 "There is going to be a next time?" 

 "I certainly hope so" she said as she reached down and fondled my limp cock, "and soon if I have any say in the matter." 

 Then she surprised me and bent down to take my cock in her mouth. I started to reach out and push her away and then I remembered what my momma had said and I pulled my hand back. 

 I was amazed at how quickly her oral attentions got me erect again and I started to move to get on top of her. She pushed me back down and said, "I'm driving this time." She got on top of me, used her right hand to line me up with her slit and then pushed down on me until she had all of me in her and then she started fucking me. It felt good, but it felt wrong and it took me a minute to figure out why. It was because I wasn't in control. I was the man so I was supposed to be in control, right? But then my momma's words came back to me again. 

 "Nothing at all wrong with any of it Rob. Whatever gives two people pleasure is a good thing." 

 It felt good to me and it was obvious that Veronica was enjoying it so did it really matter who was in control? Roni bounced around on me for a good eight or nine minutes and from what I could tell I believe that she had several climaxes. Her riding me brought me close, but while she was rubbing me good she wasn't rubbing me the right way to get me off. I rolled her over onto her back and then went after her with an urgency to get that climax that had been just out of reach. As I hammered away at her she moaned and clutched at me and her heels were drumming on the backs of my legs and then I was there and my cock erupted and I gave her (as she called it) "the full experience." 

 I stayed where I was until my cock went soft and then I pulled out of her and fell to the bed next to her. She rolled up on an elbow and looked at me and said: 

 "Why don't you go take a shower while I put the coffee on." 

 I was using the wash rag on my cock when the shower curtain was pushed aside and Roni got in the shower with me. 

 "Here, let me do that" and she took the rag from me" and we ended up back on her bed for one more go at it. As I was getting dressed she said the one thing that made the night for me. 

 "I don't know what was behind the break up of your marriage, but it obviously wasn't the sexual part, at least not on your end. Maybe we can do this again sometime." 

 "I don't have anything for tomorrow." 

 "But I do sweetie and it is something that I can't get out of. But there will be another time if you are interested." 

 When I got home there were two messages on the answering machine from Gail Sue and as soon as I heard her voice I deleted them. I had no idea of what she was going to say, but I was not going to let anything destroy the good mood that I was in. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 That good mood carried through Thursday. At two Katrina stopped by my cubicle and gave me directions to her place and at a quarter to four Marge stopped by and reminded me to keep the next Wednesday open. There was another message from Gail on the machine when I got home, but I deleted it without listening to it. 

 Friday was another good day at work and when I got off at five I hurried home to get ready for my date with Katrina. The message light was blinking on the answering machine was blinking, but I ignored it. I rang Katrina's door bell right at six. The plan was to go to dinner and then catch a movie, but mid-way through dinner we decided to go for drinks and dancing instead. I had a very enjoyable evening, but it didn't end the way I expected. The rather forward way Katrina had come after me led me to believe that my Friday evening was going to be a repeat of my Wednesday evening, but it didn't happen that way. I got a kiss on the cheek and an:  

 

 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "I had a good time tonight Rob; maybe we can do it again." 

 As I was driving home I wondered what was wrong with me. Where did I get off thinking that just because a woman went out with me she was going to fall into bed with me? Lord knows it wasn't that way when I dated before I got married so why did I think it was different now? Of course it only took half a second to come up with the answer to that question. Gail Sue's rant on sex followed by Katrina's forward manner, Marge's outright promise that next Wednesday we were going to fuck topped off by Veronica's taking me home with her had me thinking that things had changed in the way women behaved or I was suddenly irresistible. Obviously it was neither - just a set of circumstances. 

 But overall things weren't bad. Roni had said that we could do it again sometime; Katrina implied she would be open to another date and if Marge was to be believed I was going to get laid the next time we stopped after work. Not too shabby for a guy suddenly single. 

 The red light was blinking on the answering machine when I got home. Of the five messages three were from Gail asking me to call her. I deleted them and went to bed. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Saturday morning I got up bright and early, put my camping gear in the trunk of my car and headed for the lake. When I got there I pitched my tent and spent the weekend communing with nature. When I got home Sunday night the blinking red light told me that there were messages. Three from Gail which I deleted, one from my mother, one from my older sister and one from Veronica. It was too late to return the calls, but as I climbed into bed I wondered what Roni was calling for. 

 I was pouring coffee into my travel mug and getting ready to leave for work when the phone rang. I let the machine pick the call up and it was Gail again. 

 "Rob? I know you are there Rob. Pick up the phone. Please pick up Rob, we need to talk." 

 I debated answering. I suppose we would need to talk sooner or later, but I didn't want to start my week with a bummed out attitude so I walked out the door as she was saying, "Please Rob, answer the phone." 

 When I got to work I swung by Roni's office. I told her I'd been gone all weekend and had gotten back too late to return her call and then asked what she had called for. 

 "I was supposed to drive over to Waverton and spend the day with my mom, but she called and cancelled. Suddenly I had a free day and I thought maybe I could spend it with you." 

 "Damn the rotten luck. I would have liked that. Would you be free tonight?" 

 "I had something, but I can probably get out of it." 

 "Have dinner with me?" 

 "Okay." 

 "Leave from here or would you like to go home first?" 

 "We can go from here." 

 The day went by quickly as days do when you are busier than hell. I didn't even take time out for lunch. I did take the time to return my mom's call. She was just calling to see if I was okay and I told her that I was. Then I called my sister Jessica. She had just heard about Gail Sue's leaving me and wanted to know what was going on. I gave her the PG rated version: 

 "We just weren't getting along and decided to call it quits." 

 "I don't believe that for one minute Rob. I've never seen two people more suited to each other and in love with each other than Gail and you." 

 "What can I say Jess; she packed and walked out." 

 "You have a number where I can reach her?" 

 I did, but no way I was going to give it to my sister. The last thing I needed was for her to start meddling so I said: 

 "No, she hasn't bothered to let me know where she is or how to get in touch with her." 

 "Oh well, I guess I can just call her at work," 

 Shit! I'd forgotten about that. "Leave it alone Jess. She's gone and I have accepted it. Don't go stirring things up." 

 "She's my friend Rob." 

 "And I'm family Jessica. Leave it be. Just stay out of it!" 

 I hung up the phone knowing that she wouldn't. 

 Dinner was nice and when I suggested we stop for drinks Roni told me that she would much rather I take her home. When we got to her place I walked her to her door. I had learned my lesson with Katrina and I wasn't going to take anything for granted so I leaned down to kiss Roni on the cheek and was getting ready to tell her that I'd had a nice time and had enjoyed myself when she grabbed my tie and said, "You aren't going anywhere" and she pulled me into her apartment. 

 We dropped clothes all the way to the bedroom and then made love twice. After the first time she sucked my cock to get me hard for the second time and I couldn't help but think about the fact that I had refused to let Gail Sue give me the pleasure that Veronica was giving me. The second session took longer than the first and after I had cum I fell to the bed next to Roni and lay there looking up at the ceiling. 

 "A penny for your thoughts." 

 I turned and smiled at her. "After Gail left I thought that it would take me forever to get to the point where I would be seeing some one else. Fortunately I was wrong." 

 I started to get off the bed and Roni said, "Where are you going?" 

 "Home. I need to get out of here so you can get some sleep." 

 "Silly boy" she said as she reached for my cock and gently pulled me back down. "I can sleep cuddled up next to you." 

 We stopped at a Village Inn on the way to work in the morning and over pancakes and bacon I asked Roni why she wasn't spoken for. 

 "I was married once and I didn't like it. I didn't like being tied down with any one man. I wanted to sample what was out there and for some reason my husband wasn't all that keen on sharing me." 

 "So I'm being sampled?" 

 "Does it bother you?" 

 "Not really. I too new at this single bit to let much bother me. Truth is I guess just coming off of a one on one relationship I'm in the mood to do some sampling too. What are the limits of your sample policy? Am I about to be thrown back or will I be around for a while?" 

 "Are you familiar with the term friends with benefits?" 

 "I've heard it used a time or two." 

 "That's what I would like. No need to be exclusive, but when I feel the need I'd like to be able to call you and I would want you to feel the same way about calling me." 

 "Well, it is all new to me and I'm not sure that I want to get into another permanent relationship for a while so I guess I can do "friends with benefits." 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© At ten that morning Marge stopped by my cubicle. 

 "You are keeping tomorrow open for me, right?" 

 "Indeed I am" I said and as she walked away I wondered why a married woman was so eager to have something to do with me. That afternoon at four the boss called me into his office and asked me if I had any plans for the coming weekend and when I said no he told me that he wanted to send me with a team to a company we were designing a system for. 

 "You will leave Thursday morning and be gone until a week from Friday. There will be you, Kevin, Pam and Brenda. You need to sit down with John Ambers in Design to get the background and technical information you will need. I'll set it up for tomorrow at ten." 

 I left the meeting with mixed emotions. It would be my first trip to a job site as a team leader which meant that the company thought I had possibilities and that could lead to a promotion and a raise, but on the other hand I wondered if I was ready to take the step. Some body in the company thought I could do the job; I just hoped that I could meet their expectations. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 The red light was blinking on the answering machine and I deleted everything with out listening to any of it and then I turned the machine off and unplugged the phone. I made myself something to eat and then curled up on the couch to try and finish a book that I had started. At ten my eyes grew heavy and so I called it a night and went to bed. 

 Wednesday started out bad. I was coming down 16th Street approaching the entrance to the company's parking lot when I saw Gail's Honda pull onto the lot. I knew it was Gail's because of the damage to the right rear quarter panel that she had never gotten around to having fixed. Apparently she decided to ambush me in the parking lot since I wouldn't answer her phone calls. 

 I drove by the entrance and drove around the block and parked on the street behind the building and went in through the loading dock door. As I walked to my office I wondered just what the hell Gail wanted. She was pretty damned clear about things when she packed up and walked out on me. Whatever! Sooner or later I suppose I would need to talk with her and find out what she wanted, but it would be later rather than sooner. It would have to wait at least until I came home from my trip. I was not going to go on my first site visit as a team leader carrying any of the emotional baggage that talking with Gail Sue might give me. 

 I was maybe twenty minutes at my desk when Jack, the guard that manned the reception desk in the lobby, called me to tell me that my wife was there to see me. I told him to tell her that I was tied up in meetings and was unavailable. 

 "She insists that she has to see you." 

 "She walked out on me Jack and we are in the middle of a divorce. I do not want to see her or talk to her. If she won't leave do what you do with anyone else who causes a disturbance and call the police to remove her from the building. 

 "You got it!" 

 "Thanks Jack." 

 "No problem Mr. D. Been there and done that." 

 I'd just hung up the phone when Pam walked up to my desk and asked me if I had a minute. I told her I did and pointed to a chair. She sat down and said: 

 "I've been told that we are going to the Montrose site for a week and I need a favor - a big favor." 

 "What is it?" 

 "Kevin is also going with us and I am tired of him hitting on me all the time and having to listen to all of his crude remarks. Not tired enough to file sexual harassment charges against him, but I don't want an entire week of his attentions which is what I'm looking at during this site visit." 

 "So what is it you want from me?" 

 "I want you to pretend that we have something going on between us. That should keep him away from me. I wouldn't ask you to do this if you were still married, but since you and your wife have recently split up I thought I'd give it a try." 

 "Define the "something going on" for me." 

 "You know, have dinner with me, hold hands when he is around, maybe hug or put our arms around each other - things like that." 

 "That's all? Pretend to have the hots for each other so Kevin will stay away from you?" 

 "That's all. Here I can get away from him, but while at the site we will be pretty much thrown together the entire time we are there." 

 "If I do what you want that will mean that Kevin will pretty much concentrate on Brenda. You dislike her that much that you would set her up for that?" 

 "He won't bother Brenda. The last time he tried she spit in his face and kneed him in his crotch." 

 "You could do that." 

 "No I couldn't. I'm not the violent type." 

 "How do I know that this isn't some subtle plan of yours to seduce me?" 

 She looked at me for a moment and then smiled. "Would that necessarily be a bad thing?" 

 I told her I would help her and then I buried myself in the work that was piled up on my desk. At ten I went to my meeting with John Ambers and at eleven forty-five I went to lunch. The first person I saw when I got off the elevator after lunch was Marge and as she walked by she smiled at me and said, "Don't forget." 

 "As if I could" I thought as I watched her ass wiggle as she walked away. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was late getting away from the office that evening and the tables were full when I got to the bar. In addition to the ones who were there the previous week Nancy from Accounting and Sharon from the secretarial pool were also there. Veronica and Pam started pushing people around to make room and another table was pulled up to the three already there. 

 I tossed my five into the middle of the table and gave the waitress my drink order, but before it got back to me Marge pulled me out of my seat and led me out to the dance floor. She moved into my arms and said: 

 "The way we do it is this sweetie. I don't want the girls I work with to know what I do so at seven-thirty I'll tell everyone good night and leave. Give me fifteen minutes and then you leave and meet me in the library parking lot. Okay?" 

 "Got it." 

 "I don't need to be home until eleven. We going to your place or a motel?" 

 "You have a preference?" 

 "As long as there is a strong bed there it doesn't matter to me." 

 "Then instead of the library just drive to my place. That way we avoid any chance of someone driving by and seeing us meet." 

 I gave her directions and when the song ended we went back to join the group at the tables. I made it a point to dance with each woman there and not pay any particular attention to Marge when she left. Veronica wanted to know if I was up to following her home and I told her that I had something that I needed to do that evening and that I would be leaving early. She acted disappointed. 

 "I hear you are going out of town" Katrina said when I danced with her." 

 "I am." 

 "Bummer!" 

 "Why bummer?" 

 "If you aren't here you can't ask me out." 

 "I'll only be gone a week." 

 "It is still a bummer." 

 Pam asked me if I wanted to start our charade in front of Kevin since he was watching us dance and I told her no. 

 "There are some women here that I might be interested in and I don't want to poison the well." 

 "Oh pooh. You're no fun." 

 Shortly after my dance with Pam I told everyone "goodnight" and headed for home. Marge's car was in the driveway so I parked on the street so I wouldn't be blocking her when she was ready to leave. I'd told Marge where I hid the spare key so I knew she would already be in the house. As I was locking the car a voice from the darkness said: 

 "I see it didn't take you long to replace me." 

 I looked to the left and saw Gail standing next to a tree. "You are irreplaceable Gail Sue, but that doesn't mean that I have to live like a monk for the rest of my life. And fortunately for me not all women think that I am as worthless in bed as you do," 

 "I guess I deserve that. We need to talk Rob." 

 "Well Gail, this is obviously a bad time for it and besides, I didn't much like what you had to say the last time we talked and I don't know if I am up to any more conversations like that. I'm going out of town tomorrow and I'll be gone for a week. I'll be back a week from Friday. Give me a call then and maybe we can set something up. Now if you will excuse me I have a guest." 

 I walked away leaving Gail staring at my back. I don't mind saying that under the circumstances walking away from Gail and toward Marge made me feel damned good. 

 Marge was sitting on the living room couch naked except for her high heels and sipping a beer. She waved the beer at me and said: 

 "As you can see I've made myself at home and I took some steps to make sure that we didn't waste a lot of time. Your bed or here on the couch?" 

 "The bed. First door on the left at the top of the stairs" I said as I started taking off my clothes. I was down to my boxers by the time I got to the bedroom. Marge had already pulled the covers down by the time I got there and she was on the bed with her legs spread wide by the time my boxers hit the floor. As I moved toward her she said: 

 "I sure do hope you like to eat pussy" and then she saw the look on my face. "What's wrong?" 

 "I don't eat pussy." 

 "Why not?" 

 In the fraction of a second between her asking and my answer several things raced through my mind. First there was what my momma had said to me and secondly was the outcome of some thoughts I'd had after talking with momma. I'd come to realize just how naive I really was. It all went back to my notion that the missionary position was best for producing a baby. Along with that was the strong belief that oral and anal sex were bad. Not because I thought that they were really disgusting and degenerate (although that is the rationale I gave Gail) but because they were unnatural. And the reason I believed them to be unnatural was that a sperm deposit in the mouth or butt was a waste of sperm because neither of those two actions could produce a baby. 

 Yes, I was that fucked up and naive! 

 Anyway, when Marge asked the question "Why not" I answered that I didn't know how and then I lied. 

 "My wife would never let me so I never learned how." 

 "Did she give you blow jobs?" 

 "No, she believed that only whores did things like that." 

 "So you have never had a blow job?" 

 I lied again and said that I hadn't. 

 "Oh you poor baby. I'll bet you've never done anal either." 

 "Nope. Never." 

 "I can see that I have my work cut out for me." 

 She sat up and moved over to sit on the side of the bed. "Come over here lover; I'll do you first to show you what you have been missing." 

 She took me in her mouth and licked and sucked and played with my balls until I was ready to cum. I told her I was on the edge of cumming and tried to pull out of her mouth, but she held on and wouldn't turn loose of me. I moaned and shot off and she kept her mouth on me and gulped and swallowed until I was soft. 

 "Liked that?" 

 "Oh yes; oh yes indeed." 

 "Okay, now it is my turn. Get on the bed and I'll teach you how I like it done." 

 I half expected that it would turn my stomach, but it didn't. I approached her pussy a little awkwardly and she giggled and said: 

 "Come on honey; it isn't going to bite you" and then she talked me through it telling me how she liked it done. She was moaning and getting obvious pleasure out of it so I worked at it a little harder and damned if she didn't have an orgasm. After she had settled down some she said: 

 "Not bad for a first time lover; not bad at all." 

 And then she said, "Are you ready yet?" and her hand reached down and found that indeed I was erect again. "Time to show me what you got" and she spread her legs wide. 

 We made love and we both climaxed and then she sucked on me until I was hard again. She got on her hands and knees and said: 

 "Doggie this time lover. It is my favorite position." 

 As usual the second time (actually the third counting the blow job) took much longer and she had several small climaxes by the time I reached mine. After I came and pulled out of her she looked at her watch. 

 "No time for anal or sixty-nine. I guess we will save those for the next time. There will be a next time, won't there?" 

 "I'll be out of town until the week after next. Plan on seeing me when I get back." 

 "I can only do Wednesdays. That's hubby's bowling night and the only night I can get out." 

 "Then Wednesday is when it will be. Maybe we can skip wasting time at the bar and come straight here from work." 

 "That's a lovely idea." She looked at her watch again and said, "I've really got to go sweetie" and she got up and started to dress. As I watched her I said: 

 "I don't want to ruin the mood, but I am curious. Why is a married woman playing around? I only ask because of this divorce I'm going through. I'm trying to get some idea of what happened." 

 "Caught her playing around?" 

 I hadn't and I don't think that Gail ever did so I just shrugged. 

 "I don't know about her sweetie, but in my case it is simple" she said as she hooked her bra. "My husband is a good husband, a great father and I do love him to death, but the man is a total loser in bed. Two minutes, gets off and then rolls over and is snoring in just seconds. He loves blow jobs, but - for reasons I won't go into - absolutely refuses to eat pussy. He can't seem to get it through his thick skull that for most people sex is a physical need that needs to be satisfied just like the need for food and drink. Since he won't take care of that need I use my night out on Wednesday to get that need taken care of." 

 It struck me as she talked that she was pretty much describing my marriage to Gail Sue (all except for that two minute part. I had at least given Gail ten or fifteen minutes). As she stepped into her heels she said: 

 "And I do hope that you will be taking care of those needs for quite a while." 

 I walked her to the door and she said, "Thanks for a marvelous time" and she kissed me and as she walked out to her car I wondered if Gail was still out there watching. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Pam started the charade at the airport. She, Kevin and Brenda were already in the boarding area when I got there. The boarding area was full and there were no empty seats. Kevin was sitting next to Pam and I could tell by her facial expression that she would rather be somewhere else. I saw Kevin put his hand on her knee and I watched her angrily push it away. Then she saw me, jumped up, came over to me and hugged me and then gave me a kiss. "Please?" she whispered in my ear and so I kissed her back. 

 She held my hand as we walked over to the check in counter and then we stood and talked until we were called for boarding. The company had booked us into business class and our four seats were together. Brenda had the window, I had the center, Pam was on the aisle and Kevin was across the aisle in the aisle seat. Apparently that was still too close for Pam and she asked me to change seats with her. 

 When the flight got in I told Pam to check us in at the hotel and I sent her, Brenda and Kevin on ahead in the hotel courtesy bus while I rented a car and then drove to the job site and checked in. Once that was done I headed for the hotel, identified myself and was given a key to my room. When I entered the room I saw that there was a door connecting my room to the next room. I'd never been in a room with a connecting door before and I got curious and went over and put my ear to it. I didn't hear anything and then I thought "Duh Rob." The hotel would use thick doors since they wouldn't want people in one room hearing the people in the next. 

 I was unpacking when the phone rang. It was Pam calling to tell me that she had taken it upon herself to tell Brenda and Kevin that we would meet in the dinning room at six so I could tell everyone what I'd found out on my visit to the customer and what our game plan would be for the next day. I thanked her, hung up and finished my unpacking. 

 At six I told the team about my visit to the customer and then lined out what we would be doing Friday and Saturday. Sunday would be a free day and Monday would depend on what we accomplished on Friday and Saturday. We finished our dinner and Brenda excused herself saying she was beat and was going to turn in early. 

 "That sounds like a good idea. How about you sweetie" Pam asked me, "Should we turn in early too?" 

 "Not a bad idea" I said as I stood up and offered Pam my hand. We headed for the elevators and Kevin was right behind us. Pam held my hand as the three of us got on the elevator and rode it up to the third floor. The three of us got off the elevator and Pam held onto my hand as we walked to my room and then made sure that Kevin saw us both go into it. 

 "I appreciate this Rob. Maybe I can get him to leave me alone now. If not, I guess I will have to overcome my aversion to violence and do what Brenda did. He should be in his room by now." 

 She went to the door, opened it a crack and peered out. "I don't see him. See you in a bit" and then she left and closed the door behind her. 

 I sat down at the table in my room and fired up my laptop and was looking over some spread sheets when there was a knock on the door. I went and opened it, but there was no one there. Then I heard the knock again and I realized that it came from the connecting door. I opened it and found Pam standing there in high heels and a black lace nightgown. She was smiling as she said: 

 "I told you I would see you in a bit." 

 I stood there staring at her and she read the confusion on my face and giggled as she said: 

 "We have to make it look right for Kevin don't we? What better way than to actually do it. You are going to let me come in?" 

 We made love three times and between each time Pam went down on me and gave me head to get me back up again. That set the pattern for the rest of the visit. A long day at the job site; back to the hotel for dinner and then Pam and I would go up to my room. Pam never slept in her room the entire time we were there. As we sat in the boarding area waiting for the flight that would take us home Pam said: 

 "Thank you baby; thank you so much. I had a great time. Maybe we can do it again some time." 

 "I was kind of hoping that we could continue when we get home." 

 "Sorry baby, but I only do this when I'm on the road. If I did it at home my fiancÃ©e might find out and I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't approve." 

 "Your fiancÃ©e?" I mumbled as I looked at her left hand. 

 She saw the look and said, "I don't wear the ring. I'm one of those rare women who don't like to wear jewelry. I'll wear the rings when we get married, but not before. But even though we can't play at home I would appreciate it if we could be a little 'touchy-feely' whenever Kevin is around." 

 I told her that we could and then I spent the plane ride home thinking about my seeming disconnect from life around me. I had always thought of myself as a "together" kind of guy. Hard working at a good job; loving husband to the girl of my dreams and at ease with the people I knew and worked with. Then Gail Sue drops a grenade in my lap and I find out that I don't have a clue. Gail tells me I'm a loser in the bedroom and I'm thinking that she is a pervert because of what she wanted to do and then in the last three weeks I have sex with three women who all do what Gail wanted to do. 

 Even my mother tells me that she did it! 

 I grew up believing in the sanctity of marriage and find out that Marge, a married woman, is willing to fuck me at the drop of a hat and that Pam, promised to another, thought nothing of spending four nights in my bed simply because we were out of town where her fiancÃ©e couldn't see us. 

 And whatever happened to the idea that you dated a girl and built up a relationship? Veronica shot that one down. A couple of dances and two hours later we were in bed together. I knew guys in high school and later in college who dated the same girl for years and were lucky to get a goodnight kiss at the end of the date.  

 

 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I was totally out of sync with the world around me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I spent the weekend unpacking, doing laundry, going through my accumulated mail and paying bills. I went out to eat Saturday night and caught a movie. Sunday I puttered around the house, called my mother and let her know that I was home and went grocery shopping. When I got back from the store the red light was blinking on the answering machine. The call was from Gail. 

 "Rob? Are you home yet? Give me a call please." 

 I know that I'd told her that maybe we could talk when I got back from my trip, but I would need to spend Monday morning sitting down with the boss for a debriefing on the site visit. I didn't want to go into his office in a foul mood so I didn't call Gail back. 

 Monday when I got to work I just happened to get on the elevator the same time as Marge. As we rode up to our floor she said: 

 "You are going to hold Wednesday open for me, right?" 

 I smiled at her and said, "Straight from work to my place, right?" 

 "You got it lover." 

 I spent two hours in the boss's office going over what we had done on the job site and he told me that I had done an excellent job and that I could expect to sent out again. I left his office feeling like my professional life was moving in the right direction even if my personal life seemed to be a mess. 

 Around eleven I got a call from Veronica. "You doing anything tonight?" 

 "No. Planned on a quiet evening at home." 

 "I feel like cooking tonight and I always make too much and I hate to eat alone. Care to join me?" 

 "I'd love too. Can I bring something?" 

 "Maybe a nice red wine?" 

 "You got it." 

 Dinner was followed by almost three hours of exercise in her bedroom and I left her place one very tired man. 

 The red light was blinking when I got home, but I ignored it and went to bed. 

 Tuesday was a busy day at work. Katrina joined me at my table for lunch and made small talk. I know she was wondering why I hadn't asked her out again, but I didn't take the hint. She asked me if I was going to stop with the group on Wednesday and I told her no, that I had something that I had to do. I could tell she was disappointed, but I had too much going on at the time to consider another date with her. Maybe in a week, but not then. 

 The red light was blinking again when I got home. There were two messages from Gail and even though I didn't feel like talking to her I knew I was going to have to do it sooner or later so I bit the bullet and called her back. 

 "I didn't think you were ever going to call." 

 "I told you that maybe we could set something up when I got back. Well I'm back. What do you want?" 

 "I need to talk with you Rob." 

 "Why? Don't you think you did enough damage the last time you talked to me?" 

 "Please Rob, when can we get together?" 

 "I have something going every night this week, but I don't have anything for this coming Sunday." 

 "That's almost a week away." 

 "Sorry that I didn't go crawl in a deep, dark corner and hide when you bailed out on me Gail. I apologize for deciding to have a life after you left, but I do have one and right now Sunday is what I can offer you. Do you want it or not?" 

 "What time and where?" 

 "It's your party Gail Sue; you set it." 

 "Can I stop by the house around noon?" 

 "The time is okay, but not here. I've just about gotten used to you not being here and I'd like to keep it that way. I do not need you coming here and making me start over." 

 "My place then?" 

 "Give me directions." 

 She told me how to get to her apartment and then just before she hung up she said: 

 "I miss you Rob." 

 Yeah, right I thought as I hung up the phone. 

 Wednesday flew by and Marge was already at the house when I got there. She was waiting for me in the bedroom. The bed was already turned down and Marge was naked and waiting. I quickly stripped and as I approached the bed she said: 

 "Ready for your next lesson lover?" 

 "I don't know. Is it going to hurt?" 

 "Not if we do it right. Last time you got a blow job and learned how to eat pussy. This time we put them together in what is called a "sixty-nine." I'll take the top this first time and you can have the top next time." 

 "What do I do?" 

 "Same as you did last time. The only difference is that this time I'll be doing you at the same time. Here; put this pillow under your head." 

 She moved into position over me and as her pussy descended toward my face I felt her mouth close around my cock. It was an odd feeling being pinned down while a woman's sex rubbed your face, but the way she was making me feel with her mouth made me want to give back the same pleasure so I attacked her slit with lips and tongue until she started to moan and hump my face. I didn't mind because I was humping my cock up at her mouth. Suddenly she took her mouth off me and lifted herself up and said: 

 "Okay baby, you are nice and hard so momma is going to get some riding time." 

 She swiveled around and moved over me and used her right hand to guide my erection into her pussy and then she bounced around on me until I just had to get some relief. I rolled her over onto her back and went at her hard until I came. I no sooner pulled out than she moved down and took my cock in her mouth and she had me hard again in minutes. She got off the bed and walked over to her purse. 

 "Ready to try anal now?" she asked as she walked back toward me with a tube of KY Jelly in her hand. She handed me the lube and told me that the secret was to go slow and easy until I was all the way in and then slowly pick up the pace. She got on her hands and knees, put her head down on a pillow and then had me put some KY on one of my fingers and then slowly work it into her butt. She had me keep adding fingers until I had three of them in her. I worked them around for several minutes while she moaned and pushed her butt back against my hand and then she told me to lube up my dick with KY 

 "Slow and easy lover. Put the head of your cock against my hole and then gently push. Keep up the pressure until you pop past the sphincter muscle." 

 I followed her instructions and put pressure against her asshole and it resisted, but I continued the pressure and the head of my cock suddenly popped in. Marge moaned. 

 "Slow and easy lover, slow and easy. Get it all the way in before you fuck me." 

 I slowly worked my way deep into her butt and when I was fully in her I began to slowly pull back and then push in. 

 "Oh yes lover, like that; just like that." 

 After maybe half a minute she told me to go a little faster and I did and she moaned in pleasure. I couldn't believe how much tighter her ass was as opposed to her pussy. The sphincter muscle clasped me like a hand. 

 "A little harder now lover, and a little faster." 

 I kept following her lead and before long I was pounding into her ass the same way I pounded her pussy and she cried and moaned. 

 "Yess yes yes yes yes" she cried, "Fuck my ass fuck my ass fuck my ass." 

 She told me to reach under her and rub her clit while I pounded away at her and then she screamed out as she had an orgasm. She moaned, gasped, shook and panted and then it was my turn to cum and when I did it was so powerful that it left me light headed for a bit. 

 "Come on lover; lets get you cleaned up" she said as she led me to the bathroom. "We will get you squeaky clean and then I have time for one more before I leave." 

 As she was dressing she asked, "Same time same place next week?" 

 "How about we both call in sick and start at noon?" 

 She laughed and said, "Don't tempt me lover, don't tempt me." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Just after lunch on Thursday my mother called me and asked me to stop by and see her when I got off work. 

 "What's up?" 

 "I've got something that I need you to look at. It's broken and I think you can fix it." 

 "What is it?" 

 "I can't describe it honey. It is something that you will have to see for yourself. 

 I told her that I would be there around six and then I got back to work. At five minutes to six I walked in the front door of momma's house and called out, "Hello?" 

 "In the kitchen honey." 

 I headed for the kitchen and mom met me as I entered the dinning room. I gave her a hug and kissed her on the cheek and asked: 

 "Okay mom; what needs to be fixed?" 

 "It's in the kitchen. You will know what it is as soon as you see it. Mind your manners Rob. I raised you right and I know you will do what needs to be done. Now go" and she gave me a little push towards the kitchen and turned and walked toward her bedroom. I walked into the kitchen and found Gail Sue sitting at the kitchen table. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Denouncement Ch. 04 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I stopped in my tracks and stared at her. 

 "I couldn't wait until Sunday," she said. 

 "I didn't see your car out front." 

 "Your mom let me put it in the garage. We were afraid that you would keep on going if you saw it." 

 "That would have been a good bet. What do you want Gail?" 

 "In a nutshell - you." 

 "That doesn't make sense Gail Sue. You had me and you threw me away. You were very clear about your opinion of me and your need to get away from me and move on." 

 "I didn't mean it Rob. I made a big mistake. I expected you to miss me and decide that you didn't want to lose me and you would ask me to please come home. Then I was going to say okay, but only if you would loosen up sexually. The last thing that I expected was that you would file for a divorce. I thought you loved me. I thought that you would do whatever you had to do to keep me. I almost died when I was served with the divorce papers." 

 "Why would I even think about wanting to keep you after the way you trashed me? You had no use for me as I recall. You flat out told me that I was no good in bed and wasn't getting the job done and that your need for sex was greater than mine so goodbye Rob. Why, after hearing you say that, would I even think about chasing after you and trying to get you to come back?" 

 "I'm sorry Rob. I didn't mean to make it sound so harsh. You were great Rob, but only as long as we did nothing but make love in the missionary position. I needed more than that. My leaving you was supposed to make you come after me and agree to at least try the other things I wanted to do. I knew if I could get you to try them at least once you would like to continue them. The last thing that I ever expected was to have divorce papers served on me. I love you Rob and the last thing I want is a divorce. I've been trying to get you to talk to me ever since so I could get you to drop the divorce." 

 "Is that what you planned on talking about on Sunday?" 

 "Yes it was, but after last night I decided that I couldn't wait until Sunday." 

 "What happened last night?" 

 "I was driving by the house and I saw the same car that was there last Wednesday when I saw the woman come to the house and let herself in. I decided that I needed to do something quick before you got too attached to another woman so I asked your mother to help me. Honest to God Rob, I do love you. I want you back. I want you back even if I do have to settle for just missionary position sex for the rest of my life. Having you that way is one hundred percent better than not having you at all." 

 I sat there and looked at her across the table. I loved her. I missed her something fierce, but in the back of my mind there was the fact that she had caused me great pain with her denouncement of me and her walking out on me. And, as I had told my mom when she told me what I had to do to get Gail back, what would be the next thing she would threaten to leave me over? The pain had faded in the most part because of Veronica and Marge and their making me feel like I was pretty good in bed. The question was did I want to risk the pain again and the answer to that was a loud no! But how to get that across to Gail Sue in a way she could see it. I decided to be a hypocrite and go after her. 

 "I'm sorry Gail. I don't think that we can get back together after what has happened. If I took you back I would spend all my time wondering about you and the men you have been with." 

 "What men Rob? 

 "The men you have been with since you walked out on me." 

 "There haven't been any men Rob." 

 "Oh come on Gail Sue. We made love four, five and sometimes six times a week and then you made this big speech about how important sex was to you. Add to that what you told me about your sexual experiences before we got married and I'm supposed to believe that you weren't out getting laid as soon as you were out of the house? Get Serious!" 

 "I am serious Rob. No man except you has touched me since I put your ring on my finger. Knowing that and the fact that I fully expected you to come after me can you honestly believe that I would betray you?" 

 "I never would have believed that you could walk out on me like you did, but it happened." 

 "I screwed up Rob. I didn't think it through. It never even occurred to me that you wouldn't come after me. I miss you Rob. I need you. I need to come back home and be with you." 

 "And what happens the next time you don't get what you want? What will you do to me then?" 

 "I've learned Rob. I promise I'll never do anything as stupid as what I've done ever again. I screwed up Rob; I admit it and I'm begging you to drop the divorce and let me come home." 

 "I don't know Gail Sue. I don't know that I want to risk having to go through the pain again. I'll have to think about it." 

 I stood up and told her that I would be in touch and I walked out of the kitchen. Mom was sitting on the living room sofa and I didn't know how much she had heard, if anything, of what went on in the kitchen. I bent down and kissed her on the forehead and said: 

 "I behaved myself. I'll talk to you later" and then I went home. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 I didn't get a whole lot of work done on Friday. I spent the day thinking of my talk with Gail and thinking about what Veronica and I would be doing that night which brought me back to Gail Sue. I believed her when she said that she had not been with other men. During our meeting I noticed that she was still wearing her wedding rings. 

 I remembered my statements about what I expected after putting the ring on her finger and then I tried to justify my actions since Gail Sue left me. We were still married, even though going through a divorce, and Gail was still being true to her promise to me while I wasn't even close to holding to my expressed creed. That made me the worst kind of hypocrite. How could I even consider being upset at what she might have done since leaving me when I had been involved sexually with three different women during the same period? The fact of the matter was that she had honored my stated position and I had not. I could rationalize it all I wanted saying that we were being divorced so it didn't matter, but it did. We were still legally married and I was still wearing my ring. 

 At lunch I asked Roni what she would like to do on our date and she said that she didn't want to go out. 

 "I'd like to fix us a light supper and stay in. I'm sure that we can find something to occupy our time." 

 We did find something to occupy our time and while it was very enjoyable (to say nothing about it being very exhausting) I had a small problem. I thought constantly about Gail. I thought about how I was doing everything that Gail was always after me to try and how much I was enjoying it and I wondered what it would be like to be doing those things with Gail. 

 How different would it be? 

 Not having any experience before Gail Sue I wasn't aware of how much different the same thing could be with different people. Making love with Roni was different from making love with Marge which was different than the same thing with Pam and the three of them were all different than it was with Gail Sue. Gail Sue moaned and gasped. Pam made a high pitched 'keening' sound and Veronica strung out a series of "Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes" while Marge was very vocal with lots of "Fuck me, fuck me hard" and "Make me cum baby, fuck me hard and get me there" and an occasional "Oh God, I love your cock." 

 Pam gripped my shoulders and pulled me down to her whereas Gail dug her nails in my butt and tried to pull me deeper in to her. Roni wrapped her long legs around me and locked them together while Marge used her knees to clamp my waist. It was basically the same thing - get hard, put it in, go back and forth - but it was different with each of them and that was just sex in the missionary position. The three were also different in the way they gave head and did anal and I wondered how Gail would be doing those things. 

 I spent the night at Roni's and over breakfast in the morning Roni said: 

 "I had fun last night, but I'm just a bit curious. You didn't seem like you were here a time or two. Something bothering you?" 

 I sort of shrugged and she sensed that it was something that I was hesitant to talk about and she said: 

 "The nice thing about the friends with benefits relationship that we have is that you can talk to me about things without worrying about me getting bent out of shape. I have no designs on you for anything other than what we shared last night so come on sweetie, tell mommy what's bothering you." 

 What the hell I thought, it won't hurt to get someone else's take on things so I told her the entire story of my break up with Gail and about going to my mother's and finding Gail Sue there and about the talk I'd had with Gail. 

 "Oh wow! I'm only your second?" 

 I nodded my head "yes" and she said, "So where is the problem? You still care for her and it certainly sounds like she cares for you. Stop the divorce and get on with your life." 

 "The problem is the old adage "Once burnt, twice shy." If she would walk out on me over something as simple as sex what would keep her from walking out over something more important?" 

 "That is your first big problem sweetie. You keep thinking that sex is unimportant. Sex is very important to a lot of people. Maybe not to some with a low sex drive, but for some one with a normal sex drive sex is a physical need just like the need to eat, drink and breathe. And for some one with a high sex drive, which it sounds like what your wife has, the need is even greater. To be honest sweetie, I can understand why she did what she did. I probably would have done the same thing. The big difference between your wife and me is that I would most definitely have been making up for the long dry spell as soon as I was out of the house. You will remember that I wasn't at all hesitant to get you in my bed as soon as I found out about your divorce. 

 "You obviously like sex; at least you sure seem to like to do what you do with me, so you should be able to take care of your wife's needs. As for her leaving you over something else? Worry about that when it happens. If it does happen then next time you don't let her come back. You go to that other old adage, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." 

 "There is still the problem of you." 

 "Me? Why am I a problem? We don't have a long term thing going for us. All I am interested in is occasional fun." 

 "That's not what I mean. I only got involved with you because I thought as soon as she moved out she started having sex with someone. I thought, "What the hell; she is so I can too." It turns out that she didn't, but I did." 

 "So what? Tell her about it. Let it be her punishment for doing what she did to you. She will accept it or she won't. If she doesn't accept it her feelings for you aren't as strong as she says they are and there is no sense in the two of you getting back together." 

 I spent the rest of the weekend trying to keep too busy to think about Gail and the talk we'd had and without any luck. I would put her out of my mind and ten minutes later she would be back. I went to work Monday with no clearer idea of what I should do than I'd had on Thursday after our talk. What complicated things was that I did love Gail and I did miss her. I missed her so bad that it hurt, but I could not forget the cold way she looked right at me and said: 

 "I'll cut right to the chase; I'm leaving you" and the equally cold, "You are no good in bed." 

 I knew then that she said those things for their shock value, but she did say them and they had cut deeply into me. 

 Marge stopped by my desk shortly after I got to work and asked if we were still on for Wednesday and I said yes. As she walked away from me I wondered if I had just made up my mind. Would I have said yes so quickly if I were really going to let Gail come back? Also, I saw Katrina sitting at her desk and I wondered if she was doing anything Friday night and would I have been thinking like that if I was seriously considering putting things back together with Gail Sue? Fortunately I had so much work on my desk that it took my mind off the Gail problem. 

 The red light was blinking on the answering machine when I got home. Two messages - both the same - "Please call me Rob." I knew she was looking for an answer and I didn't have one to give her so I didn't return her calls. She knew what time I usually got home and I expected her to call again so I unplugged the phone and turned off the answering machine. 

 I didn't sleep well that night. There were two warring factions in my head and they were pushing hard at each other. One was saying "Get her back, you know you want to. You know you love her and miss her." The other was saying "Don't do it. Don't let her back in your life so she can hurt you again." 

 I finally fell into a fitful sleep. The alarm jarred me awake and in the half awake/half asleep state I reached over and shut the alarm off and as I did I noticed that Gail's head was not on the pillow next to mine and for a fraction of a second I wondered where she could be. And then I came fully awake and remembered that she was no longer with me. I sat on the edge of the bed shaking my head and wondered why I thought she should have been there. Was my sub- conscious mind sending me a message? 

 I dressed and went to work and around nine or so Roni stopped by my desk and asked me if I would like to stop by her house and play on Sunday and I surprised myself when I said: 

 "I don't know. I guess it will depend on my wife." 

 "Oh? You've made a decision?" 

 "I guess I have" I said as I reached for the phone. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 I knocked on the door to Gail's place right at six and the door immediately opened. It was almost like she had been standing inside just waiting for my knock. She led me into the kitchen and she sat down at the table while I stood there and looked down at her. 

 "I've thought about what you said last Thursday. I know you said that you really didn't mean the things that you said about me, but that doesn't change the fact that you did say them and they hurt me deeply. I can't say to myself "Oh goody, she didn't mean what she said so you can just forget all about the pain and suffering" and have it go away. I had to live with it Gail Sue. I didn't know then that you didn't mean it so I had to live with it. I had to live with knowing that you walked out the door and before the week was over you were lying on your back, legs spread and welcoming another man into your body. 

 "I swear to you Rob I didn't....." 

 "I know what you said last Thursday Gail and I believe you, but based on what you told me about your past, about how highly sexed you were and how I wasn't getting the job done I just knew you had to be getting sex as soon as you could find a place with a bed. That is the impression that you left me with Gail and though it might not have happened you still planted the seed. Perception is reality to the perceiver Gail Sue and my perception was that you didn't get what you wanted from me so you were leaving so you could get it from someone else. Again, perception is reality and I perceived that you were out there making up for the long dry spell you suffered through by being with me." 

 "Honest to God Rob, I..." 

 "I already said that I believe you Gail, but you didn't say it until last Thursday. So in my mind from the day you left me until last Thursday you were out there getting laid as much as you wanted. So I developed the attitude that what you were out there doing cancelled the contract we made with each other when we exchanged vows. The second you were served with divorce papers I considered myself free to have a sex life of my own and I have been sexually involved with three different women. And there is more. I have done with them the things you wanted me to do with you. I have had blow jobs and they were great. I have eaten pussy and have come to like doing it. I have found anal sex to be enjoyable and as far as positions are concerned I've tried doggie, cowgirl and reverse cowgirl and I liked them all. 

 "Why am I telling you all this? To make a point Gail. I am not the same man that you walked out on. I have changed a lot and probably for the better, but there is one thing about me that you need to know. I am a hypocrite. If you had so much as kissed another man after walking out on me I would not take you back if my life depended on it, but if you come back it will be knowing that I was out there having a good time and I'm not the least bit sorry that I did. 

 "But notice that I said "if." If I let you come back it will be with the understanding that in the sexual department it will be what I say goes. Even though I have tried all the things you have always wanted to do and found out that I like them I will not be doing them with you. If you come back it will be with the knowledge that all you will be getting is straight missionary position sex until I decide otherwise. Could be three months, could be a year. Could be five years, but whatever, until I decided different it will be missionary position only and with no whining. The first time you bitch about it you are out of the house and the divorce is back in the works. A little Draconian perhaps, but you hurt me and I want payback. I figure that you knowing that I like those things you wanted, but won't do them with you will make you suffer some of the anguish I suffered through. 

 "Think about it Gail, and decide if you want to come back under those conditions. I'll call you Thursday for your answer." 

 "I can answer you now." 

 "I don't want your answer now. I want you to take the time to think long and hard on the choice I have just given you. I'll call you Thursday. 

 I walked out leaving her sitting at her kitchen table. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 "Oh God yes, do it baby, fuck my butt" she moaned as I drove myself into her tight shitter. It had been a hard night. It had started out with me eating her pussy and then taking her doggie. Then she sucked me hard and I fucked her missionary. Next was a sixty-nine to get me up again after which she rode me cowgirl. Another blow job to get me up again so I could drive up her dirt road. As I pressed hard for my fourth release of the night I wondered if her husband was really all that poor in bed or if the problem was that she had just flat worn the poor man out. As fit as I was I was having a hard time staying with her and I was only seeing her one night a week. 

 I felt it coming and I gripped her hips and hit her hard. She recognized the signs and moaned, "Give it to me, cum for me baby, cum for me" and I let go in her. It wasn't much - probably just a dribble - since she had gotten most of what I had the first three times. She fell forward on the bed and rolled over on her back. She smiled up at me and said: 

 "If I wash it off and work on it do you think you might have one more in you?" 

 "No way, no way at all." 

 "Well then I guess I might as well shower. Next week you better take your vitamins lover." 

 "There may not be a next week." 

 "Oh? Getting tired of me already?" 

 "The wife and I are talking about her coming back. I should know what we are going to be doing by the end of the week. If we decide that it won't work I'll be free next Wednesday and if we decide to give it a try I won't." 

 "That's not fair. I finally find a playmate that suits me and you bail out on me." 

 "You would have gotten tired of me eventually. Either that or I would have found a girlfriend. I'm the marrying kind. I like being married and you are already spoken for. Of course you could always leave your hubby." 

 "Not a chance lover. Except for the bed part he is solid gold and I'm keeping him." 

 "Well, don't give up on me just yet. I'll know by Friday what Gail and I will be doing."

 "Thank you Marge." 

 "For what?" 

 "For making me feel wanted." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Thursday just seemed to drag along. I wondered what Gail would decide. Would she accept my conditions or not? I didn't know which way to bet. What I did know was that I had deliberately made the choice hard. I needed to know just how badly she wanted to come home. If she balked at the limitations I had put on sex that would tell me that we would eventually have problems in that area again and I was not - repeat not - going to go through that again. 

 Simply put, when Gail walked out she left me believing that she was willing to throw away a perfectly good marriage because I wouldn't go along with what she wanted sexually. Well, if she wanted back into the marriage she was going to have to go along with what I wanted sexually. 

 At four-thirty I called Gail. "Have you made up your mind?" 

 "When we talked the other day I was going to say yes, but you told me to wait, that you didn't want my answer until today. That gave me a couple of days to think about it and the more I thought about it the more uncomfortable I am with the master/slave relationship you propose." 

 "There is no master/slave thing Gail. I'm not going to order you to do anything or make you do anything you don't want to do. All I said that was as far as sex is concerned I'm in charge of determining when, where, what and how often. If you don care for the when, where and what you are free to say no. As far as the how often is concerned you are free to say no to that also plus you have the right to start things yourself as long as you understand that I am free to say no." 

 "I think we need to negotiate a little on the sexual things Rob." 

 "Then I guess I have my answer. Goodbye Gail." 

 I saw Katrina still at her desk and on a whim I asked her if she would like to join me for a drink after work. She said yes and grabbed her coat. Two drinks later I had a date for Friday night. 

 No blinking light when I got home because I hadn't plugged the phone or answering machine back in following the last time I unplugged them. As I fixed myself something to eat I thought about my situation. I missed Gail Sue. I was devastated when she walked out on me, but I had recovered and while I still missed her and would like to go back to the life I had before she bailed out on me I was not going to crawl off into a corner and curl up and die if she didn't come home. 

 My life was not empty! 

 Without really trying I had a pretty good sex life and I had it with no emotional entanglements. Things were not bad at all and I slept soundly when I went to bed that night. 

 +++++++++++++ 

 The next day at work I got two calls from Gail and I didn't take either of them. I left work early to go home and get ready for my date with Katrina. When I walked out of the house I saw Gail coming up the walk toward me. 

 "We need to talk Rob." 

 "Sorry Gail, but I have a date and I'm running late." 

 I walked by her and headed for my car and Gail followed me. "Damn it Rob, this is important. Don't you even want to try and save our marriage?" 

 "What marriage would that be Gail Sue? The one you threw in the trash the night you walked out on me?" 

 "I explained that Rob." 

 "So what Gail? Did your explanation magically make what I suffered never happen? I gave you a way back Gail. All it required from you was a simple yes or no answer. You had my conditions and all you had to do to come home was say yes. Instead you said that we needed to negotiate. That was a "no" Gail." 

 As I was opening the car door she said, "All right Rob! I agree. Yes to all your conditions, okay?" 

 "Fine Gail. I never changed the locks so you can move back in whenever." 

 I got in the car and she said, "Where are you going?" 

 "I told you: I have a date." 

 "But we are getting back together." 

 "True, but you didn't say "yes" on when we talked on Thursday so I made a date for tonight. She said yes and she is dressed and is expecting me and I am not about to call her five minutes before I'm supposed to pick her up and say that I'm not coming. I'll see you later." 

 I closed the car door and backed down the driveway leaving her standing there staring at me. The look on her face as she watched me drive away was most definitely some partial payback. 

 When I made my date with Katrina I was wondering what she would be like in bed and I'll admit to thinking about ways to get there, but that was before Gail said yes to my terms. After leaving Gail in the driveway I fully intended that my date with Katrina would be just a simple date. Dinner, some drinks, some dancing and then maybe a kiss on the cheek when I took her home. 

 I remembered my last date with Katrina and I had it in my mind that she was a "good girl" so I was not prepared when instead of a kiss on the cheek I got a mile of tongue in my mouth. I was even more surprised when she opened her apartment door, took me by the hand and pulled me inside. She kicked the door shut with her foot, put her arms around my neck and kissed me again. It was a passionate kiss and I started to get an erection. Since she was tight up against me with her tongue in my mouth she felt it. She pulled back from me and asked, "Oh baby, is this for me?" and she dropped her hand to rub it softly through my pants. 

 I had no idea of how hard it could be to fight off an extremely attractive woman who wanted to play. Not hard physically because I could take hold of her hands and push them away, but mentally it was a different story. How do you make yourself push her away? I had wanted her on our first date, but nothing happened. I was thinking of ways to get her into bed when I asked her for the date we were on. And here she was freely offering what I had wanted right up to the time I had walked out my front door and I was having to fight an internal battle with myself to make myself refuse the gift. 

 It was stupid of me, but I was the way I was. The instant I'd told Gail that she could come back home I was a married man again with vows I had to stick to. So why with that mind set had I even gone on a date with Katrina? Because based on our first date I fully expected that nothing was going to happen except dinner and dancing (and of course there was the "tweak Gail factor and God knows I owed her that). The problem was how to refuse what was being offered and still stay on good terms since I still had to work with Katrina every day. I finally decided that the best way would be to tell Katrina what had happened. 

 "Then why did you still take me out?" 

 "Because I knew you would be dressed and ready to go and be expecting me to ring your doorbell any minute. I did not think it would be right for me to cancel at that late a time." 

 "That's sweet Rob, but I would have understood if you had explained why." 

 "I didn't know that and I was concerned about what a quick cancellation might have meant to our relationship at work." 

 "At least you were gentleman enough to tell me now. I know guys who in the same situation would have jumped into bed with me anyway." 

 "You will never know how hard it is for me not to do just that." 

 She pulled my head down and kissed me again and said, "Go home to your wife Rob, but keep me in mind if things don't work out."

 Gail's car was in the garage when I got home and she was sitting on the couch flipping channels when I walked into the house. She glanced up at me when I walked into the room and I could see in that quick glance that she was pissed, but I knew that because of the situation and what we had been through that she didn't dare say anything. She had managed to get back into the house and she was not going to say or do anything that would upset the apple cart. 

 "Have a nice time?" she asked. 

 "It was okay. She is a pretty good dancer." 

 "I wasn't expecting you home so early." 

 "Why not? Dinner, a few drinks and some dancing doesn't take all night." And then I understood what she was really saying. 

 "When you said "yes" tonight the marriage was back and the vows we made came back into effect. Dinner and dancing is all that it was going to be and the only reason that it was even dinner and dancing was that it would not have been fair to her to call and cancel only minutes before she was expecting me to be there to pick her up." 

 "I'm waiting up for you because I wasn't sure where you wanted me." 

 "Excuse me?" 

 "Am I back in our bedroom or do I need to be in the spare bedroom?" 

 "That's a silly question. You belong in our bedroom. Why on Earth would you expect me to want you anywhere else?" 

 She jumped up from the couch and threw her arms around me. "Oh God baby, but I have missed you. I'm sorry that I was so stupid. I'll make it up to you baby; I promise that I will make it up to you." 

 I stepped back from her. "I need to get this suit off and take a shower. Have you got all your stuff here?" 

 "No. I've still got some stuff I need to go get." 

 "Okay then, we will get a good nights sleep and tomorrow we can go and get the rest of your things." 

 When I came out of the shower I found Gail lying naked on the bed and looking up at me expectantly. I dropped my towel on the floor, got on the bed, moved between her spread legs and then I surprised her by lowering my head and licking her pussy. I worked on her until I gave her an orgasm and then I pulled back and moved up on her and she took hold of my cock and pulled it into place and as I sank in she cried out and her legs came up and locked around me. I pounded her pussy through three orgasms and then I had my own and as I started to pull out she clutched me to her and moaned: 

 "Leave it in baby, leave it in. I don't want to give it up." 

 I held myself in her until I was completely soft and then I rolled off of her and settled in next to her on the bed. She cuddled up next to me and the two of us were quiet for a bit and then she said: 

 "You went down on me." 

 "Yes I did, didn't I." 

 "You said only missionary position." 

 "I also said "until I decide otherwise." 

 "Does the fact that you did mean that I can?" 

 "Can what?" 

 "This." 

 She lowered her head and took my cock in her mouth. She had me hard in almost no time and she pulled me on top of her. 

 "Can we try something else?" 

 "What?" 

 "Can we work on making a baby?" 

 "Sounds like a marvelous idea" I said as I slid into her. Report_Story
