Text Trouble

It was a chance comment that started me thinking, just one of those random statements during a conversation that can trigger a thought process where one thought leads to another, then another and so on. 

I'd just mentioned to a colleague that my twenty-fifth wedding anniversary was coming up, Silver anniversary as it goes, and in all those years I'd never strayed from the path of marital fidelity. 

'Yeah,' my colleague joked, 'but what about your wife!' 

Ok, it was a joke, in poor taste if you ask me, but a joke nonetheless. The conversation moved on and the comment was forgotten. Forgotten until I arrived home later that evening and my wife's car wasn't in the drive where it usually sat. Now, that in itself was no big deal, she could be in any one of half a dozen locations, all of which were entirely innocent, but... 

As I went about my usual evening routine I thought about how I could surprise my wife on our anniversary, but then I remembered my friend's joke earlier that day â€“ What about my wife? Had she ever been unfaithful? Where was she now? 

I had no real reason to suspect that Abigail had ever been untrue, no reason at all, but the tiny seed of doubt had been planted. 

Abigail breezed into the kitchen in her usual style about an hour later. 

'Hi, baby,' she said brightly and kissed me on the cheek. 'Good day?' 

'Yep,' I replied and took a moment to study my wife as she moved briskly around the kitchen. 

I hadn't really 'looked' at her for a long time. Physically she was still the same curvy, full-breasted girl I'd lusted after when we were both nineteen. Ok, she was a little bigger around the hips and bust, and maybe her tummy wasn't as flat as it has been when we'd first met, but likewise, I was no longer a 32 inch waist, with the same laws applying to my body as Abigail's. Abigail's fresh faced prettiness had developed into what I thought was a striking beauty and she'd actually grown more attractive as the years had passed. Maturity gave her a certain indefinable quality. A woman either had it, or she didn't... and my wife simply oozed confident sexuality. 

Abigail definitely had the attributes that would lead men to attempt to begin an affair with her; I knew that even if I was her husband. I didn't think Abigail would be tempted to look elsewhere for sexual gratification, things had never been lacking in that department, but I just couldn't shake that nagging "yeah, but" notion. 

As I absently considered the situation a sudden rush of affection for Abigail overcame me and I took hold of her around the waist and kissed her mouth quickly. 

'Wow,' she responded with a laugh. 'What was that for?' 

Her question struck a chord within me. Had it been a long time since I'd shown her any affection? I decided to remedy that situation right there and then. 

'Because I love you,' I retorted, 'and because I think you're still a damn sexy wench.' 

I accompanied the comment by reaching around Abigail and pulling her into me. I kissed her mouth again, but this time kept up the pressure and even pushed my tongue into her mouth. Our kiss lasted for a long moment and then continued as she moaned quietly in appreciation. I ran my hands down Abigail's back to knead her lovely, pliant buttocks. She wriggled a little from side to side, a sure sign that she was becoming aroused and my penis thickened quickly at the realisation. 

'That was nice,' my wife whispered and smiled as the kiss momentarily broke. 'And what do we have going on down here,' she continued and pressed that open palm of her hand against my bulging trouser front as we kissed again. 

Abigail deftly unzipped my flies and fished my now stiff cock out from where it had been confined. My erection jutted between our bodies as we kissed with increasing ardour. I had to stop kissing Abigail as I sucked in a great gasp of air when she surprised me by taking a tight grip on my cock at its base. 

'Wow,' Abigail commented, 'what's got you so stiff?' 

'Just the usual,' I replied, my voice husky with my sudden arousal. 'Just the thought of your lovely, big tits swinging as I fuck you.' 

Abigail laughed throatily, a sound that somehow managed to turn me on even more. 'Well,' she said and stepped back a pace, 'let's see if you can get them swinging.' 

She pulled the cotton blouse she was wearing out of the waistband of her skirt and began to unbutton it. She smiled deviously, as though she was harbouring some kind of secret and her eyes narrowed to feline slits as she watched my reaction to her impromptu strip show. That look was one I knew well. It meant that Abigail was feeling horny, particularly so, and I was taken aback by how quickly she'd become so randy. 

Abigail shrugged the blouse over her white skinned shoulders and let it fall to the floor behind her. She unzipped her skirt and wriggled her hips to move the garment down over her slim, elegant, shapely legs. She pulled her underwear down swiftly as well and then posed with her hands on her wide hips, taunting me in a way she knew would send me insane with wanting her. 

'Do you want to see my lovely, big tits,' she teased and cupped her still bra covered jugs in her palms. 

'Yes please,' I croaked, 'please show me.' 

Abigail laughed again and unclasped her bra. Her fantastic tits swayed heavily as my wife allowed me to gaze on their symmetrical beauty. The sight of her almost naked caused a burst of lust to tighten my belly and I groaned out loud, growing desperate to fuck my divine wife as I looked at her, transfixed. 

The combination of Abigail's high-heeled shoes, along with the stockings and suspenders she'd purposefully left on mesmerized me, just as the calculating bitch new they would. She knew I had a penchant for the lingerie and that I loved her in her shoes and stockings. 

'Now that I've shown you my beauties,' Abigail whispered, 'I think you should give me a little treat.' 

She turned and, with hips swaying provocatively, strode from the room as her high heels clicked on the floor tiles. I'd always associated the sound of clicking heels on a hard floor with sex, ever since Abigail had teased and tormented me one evening early on in our courtship all those years ago. She had tied me to a chair in the old kitchen in her parents' cottage and had spent the entire evening posing and strutting around in front of me dressed almost exactly as she was now. She'd exacerbated the torture by using first her fingers and then a large girthed candle on her increasingly sodden sex. By the time she'd untied me I was as randy as a dog with two cocks and I'd cum hugely inside her after a frantic, short-lived, but very hot fuck. 

Abigail paused by the kitchen door and looked back over her smooth shoulder and smiled. 'Come on, lover boy,' she breathed vampishly, then added crudely, 'Come and lick my hot kitty, make it piss cum.' 

Damn Abigail knew just how to get me going. Her dirty talk never failed and I hurried after my wife's receding figure as she headed upstairs. 

I didn't have to go very far though, since Abigail stopped at the top step, sat down and opened her stocking clad legs. I knelt on one of the lower steps and pushed my face against her plump, sparsely haired vulva. Instantly I slid my tongue along the cleft of her sex and felt her lovely labia peel apart reluctantly, sticky with Abigail's arousal. 

I lapped at Abigail's clitoris and heard her gasp of pleasure. At the same time as I slurped at Abigail's large clit I probed at her opening with my finger. I slid my digit into my wife's gooey sex and massaged the spot inside her that I knew would send her into orbit. 

Sure enough Abigail began to pant quickly in time with my probing and I knew she would come within a matter of minutes. 

'Oh yes, baby, that's it, that's the spot,' She whispered as she warmed up. 'Lick my clit, finger my cunt.' 

Abigail's voice was high pitched with her desire and I felt her juice dribble from her opening around my fingers. I tasted the syrup that slid from my wife's body and I listened to her heightened excitement as she sighed and urged me on. 

Abigail squealed out as her climax poured through her body. As she came loudly she pulled me up so that my face was close to hers and then kissed me. Our tongues danced as she licked her juice from my tongue and then my chin and cheeks. Her climax tapered off and my wife sat on the top stair and panted heavily as she tried to catch her breath. 

I grinned at her as I watched her big breasts jiggling sexily as her chest heaved up and down. 

'You liked that, huh?' 

'Mmm,' Abigail responded, her face and chest flushed a rosy colour from her exertion. 'Lovely,' she continued and then lifted herself from the carpet. 'Come with me.' 

I followed my wife into our bedroom. My cock was still huge and jutted from my trousers since I was still fully dressed. Abigail sat on the bed and took hold of my shaft before she dipped her head forward and took the big head of my cock between her lips. 

'Shit,' I groaned as Abigail slurped and slobbered over my cock. She sucked at me eagerly and wanked my cock at its root at the same time. 

She scooped my balls out of the confines of my trousers as well and rolled them in her fingers, sounds of appreciation coming from the back of her throat. 

Abigail let my cock bounce from between her lips and I looked down at her smeared lipstick while she grinned up at me. 

'Time for a tit fuck I think,' she smiled and squeezed her pliable tits around my cock. 

I jerked my hips so that my cock was buried in the deep cleavage of Abigail's breasts. My precum left a wet trail of clear goo along the track of my thrusting cock all over Abigail's pure, white skin as I fucked between those big tits. The squelching of my cock as it popped into view with each upward thrust was obscene, but hugely exciting and I soon felt my semen threaten. 

'That's it!' Abigail cried as I began to grunt. 'Fuck my tits, come on my tits.' 

She was trying to flick her tongue over the head of my cock as it appeared with each thrust and her voice sounded almost as excited as I was feeling. 

I groaned and moaned as my spunk splashed out onto the delicious ivory slopes of my wife's breasts. A think rope of cum dangled from her chin as she watched my ejaculation intently. The cum hung tenaciously to Abigail's face and swung wildly as she moved her head. More goo spattered across her cheek as it jetted from my cock until finally the thick, violent eruption died off. 

'Fuck, Jimmy,' said Abigail. 'You covered me in it.' 

She smeared my spunk into her lovely, big jugs and scooped some of the stuff into her mouth from where it clung wetly to her chin and cheeks. Then she kissed me and I tasted myself on my wife's tongue, not in the least bothered by the thought of eating my own cum as we kissed. 

'Well, baby,' smiled Abigail. 'I'm a fucking mess now, but it was a lovely surprise.' Then she stood up and exaggeratedly swayed her hips to tease me as she headed for the en-suite. 

The Phone 

In spite of there being no sign at all of infidelity on Abigail's part, that nagging suspicion wouldn't go away and after an age of deliberation I decided to put her to the test. 

Let sleeping dogs lie, they say. Wise words, but I just couldn't let it lie and I embarked on my crazy plan anyway. 

What did I do? Well, it was simple, looking back it was fucking ludicrous â€“ doomed to failure; well, you would've thought so. The trouble was it all went so well. 

I bought a pay as you go sim card for my mobile phone, one with a number that Abigail wouldn't recognise. Then I sent her a text message; one that appeared to have been sent to the wrong number, but one that was crudely worded so as to get Abigail's attention. 

Simple? 

If she replied innocently, telling the sender that he had the wrong number â€“ then no problem. If she failed to respond at all â€“ well absolutely no problem. Then there was scenario number three; if she responded... 

The question there was how far would my darling wife go? 

'Hi baby, big and hard and waiting for you.' Would that grab Abigail's eye? 

I sent the message ...and waited. 

A day passed ...nothing, so far so good. 

Another day followed and then two more. I was feeling decidedly foolish and more than a little ashamed that I'd doubted Abigail. Then, when I turned the phone on a full five days after I'd sent the original text, the phone buzzed and vibrated â€“ A message! 

There could only be one person who could've sent the text for only one person had ever received the number â€“ Abigail. 

The small envelope icon blinked accusingly upon the screen, taunting me, daring me to open it and read the contents. Even then I had the power to stop, to go no further, but the power had deserted me so I opened the message and read the lines my wife had written. 

'Interesting text, but wrong number. Let me know if she doesn't get back to you. Abi xxx' Ok, she'd flirted, it didn't mean much, I could even see her doing it and laughing. She'd probably tell me about it later. But if that was going to happen, why hadn't she shown me the message in the interval between the sending and now? 

I wrote back. 'Oops, sorry Abi. I'm embarrassed now! Mick. xx PS, she didn't... are you busy?' 

Her response was almost instant. 

'Not busy. Are you?' 

And it followed from there. 'Mick' and Abi ascertained that, miraculously, they were in quite close proximity geographically - Strange that, isn't it? â€“ And the flirting got more and more daring with every subsequent message that was passed. 

This went on for a week or so and I was amazed at my reactions and emotions. I went through peaks and troughs. One minute in the depths of despair over my wife's apparent ease at infidelity. I mean how many men had she had over the course of twenty-five years? Then I recognised that part of me was actually mildly aroused by the flirtatious 'Abi'. She was fun, daring and crude even... and I felt a twitch of desire every time the phone buzzed a new message. 

This could have gone on forever with no resolution to my problem at all. The to-ing and fro-ing of these texts was ludicrous and proved nothing. I would have to act... and so the second, insane, part of the plan was born. 

I would have to arrange for Abi to meet Mick. 

Now, obviously, I couldn't put in an appearance as Mick myself, so I hired an actor. 

He was a handsome enough guy, well groomed, physically appealing and at thirty- two years of age he was neither too old, nor too young for a woman of Abigail's fine vintage â€“ he was perfect in fact. 

I watched my wife prepare for her clandestine meeting with 'Mick'. She was going out, she said, to meet her friends for a celebratory drink for some fictitious reason. I was amazed at how cool she was. It was as if butter wouldn't melt and I felt the now familiar conflicting, yet paradoxically tuned feelings of jealousy and lust. 

Part of me wanted to tell the deceitful bitch that I knew what she was up to, but it was like the devil and the angel on opposing shoulders, with one whispering and cajoling and the other offering moral support. Part of me actually wanted Abigail to come home later with the stain of deceit oozing from between her legs and with the ache of another man's penis bruising her opening. 

'Bye, Jimmy,' Abigail kissed my cheek and was gone. 

My guts coiled and I tasted the corrosive, copper tang of jealousy at the back of my throat. She was out there now on her way to her potential lover. I had no means of knowing what would happen. I couldn't call Abigail, not without a sound reason and 'Mick' now had the 'dirty' phone that I'd used to set up the whole affair. 

Abi strays 

The man smiled when he saw the mature woman in the red dress stride confidently into the restaurant. 

'Wow,' he thought, 'she's quite a sexy looking lady. This makes more sense now.' He stood up as the lady approached and gave her his best 'audition' smile. 'Hi, you must be Abi?' he said out loud. 

'And you must be Mick,' she teased in reply and took the man's proffered hand in hers briefly. 

'In the flesh,' the man known as Mick laughed and then brushed Abigail's cheek with his lips. 

He didn't want to appear too forward, he understood from reading the texts that the husband had shown him just how flirtatious "Mick' was supposed to be, and he was the consummate professional; he'd play it just right. 

'So, Abi... at last...' Mick left the sentence hanging and smiled again at the woman now sat opposite him. 'Damn, she's really very sexy,' he thought to himself. 'Look at those jugs... Damn.' 

'I must say,' Abigail began, 'that you're better looking than I'd actually pictured you...' Then she added, 'Sorry, I didn't mean to be so... forward. I'm just surprised that's all.' 

'Surprised?' asked Mick, a little confused. 

'Yes,' Abigail reddened slightly. 'I mean I must be at least fifteen years older than you... you must get tons of girls...' 

Mick thought: 'I'd still fuck you into a coma.' Then spoke out loud, 'I've always loved the more ...mature woman, they're so much more developed intellectually; have more idea of what they want,' he held Abigail's eyes with his own stare, 'and they know how to get it,' he concluded suggestively. 

'I wouldn't know about all that,' Abigail responded, her confidence appeared to slip for a moment. 'I've never actually done anything like this before... I don't know why I'm here, really... Intrigued I suppose.' 

A waiter who had arrived to take the order interrupted them but Mick dealt with the man confidently. The waiter slipped discretely away leaving the couple alone. 

'You were saying...' Mick pressed gently. 

'Well,' continued Abigail. 'I've never done this before... Never met a man without my husband knowing. I've never lied to him, never been unfaithful.' 

That was all Mick really needed to know. He could leave now of he wanted to. He could make up a quick excuse and be gone, his job was done, and he'd get paid just the same. He could still find something to do with his evening. He could report back to the husband that Abigail was a paragon of virtue. He believed her when she said she'd never strayed â€“ why should she lie? No reason at all. 

Yep, he could go right now, but she was just so damned sexy... He wanted to stay. 

The food was superb and the wine flowed. Abigail loosened up more and more as one bottle led to a second. Mick turned on the full spotlight of his charm and the embryo of a plan formed. He could do this... he could seduce this woman and still report back that she had never strayed; not until tonight anyway... if he had his way. 

'So tell me, Abi,' Mick leaned close over the table and took Abigail's hand in his own. 'Tell me a fantasy of yours; right now ...just tell me.' 

Abigail blushed, 'No,' she demurred, her eyes downcast as the rosy glow spread over the upper slopes of her breasts that were tantalisingly revealed in the deep V of the dress. 'Honestly, I couldn't... Sorry.' 

'Go on, Abi,' Mick teased gently. 'Tell me; tell me something that would shock me. I bet you can't shock me.' 

Abigail chuckled, 'Oh you're good,' she whispered suddenly changing her attitude again. She took a deep breath, 'Ok,' she said, 'a threesome, that's what I'd love to try... two men at once.' 

'Well,' Mick replied. 'I'm not shocked, not at all.' He held Abigail's hand and drew small circles on her palm with his finger while his other hand stroked the soft skin just on the inside of her slim wrist. 'Just promise me one thing, Abi.' 

'What's that?' 

'That if you ever do go for it, call me; I'd love to be part of it. I'd love to be one of the cocks that you take.' 

Abigail felt her insides clench and her pussy begin to oil. The combination of wine, Mick's handling of her sensitive skin and his borderline lewdness was turning her on.  

===

'Why not?' she thought. 'Why not just throw caution to the wind? Ok, maybe not a full on three-way, not tonight, but just having this handsome thirty- something take her to bed, have a different cock in her hand, her mouth and yes, inside her kitty. Why not? 

Suddenly Abigail's desire burst hotly between her thighs and she squirmed in her seat. Her clitty began to pulse and she felt her nipples throb in sympathy. 

'Do you live nearby?' Abigail's throaty voiced question took Mick slightly off guard. 

'Er... Not too far,' he replied. 

'Take me there,' Abigail whispered simply. 

Mick acted immediately after a very quick recovery. He paid the bill and escorted Abigail to his car. A short drive later and Abigail found herself in Mick's flat. She didn't have time to look around, for no sooner than they were in the door than Mick made his move. He took hold of Abigail's waist firmly and pulled her close. He pressed his mouth to Abigail's painted lips and kissed her. After the briefest moment of hesitation, Abigail responded and returned the kiss with ardour. 

Mick lifted Abigail's dress up and the woman lifted her arms in a gesture of submission; he was in charge and she would do as he wanted. 

'Fucking hell, Abi,' Mick murmured when he surveyed an almost nude Abigail. She stood in front of him like an Amazon of legend. She was braless now and her tiny thong lay in a discarded heap to one side. His eyes roved over the generous curves of her breasts, her narrow waist, then down and over the swell of her hips. He looked at her plump vulva that nestled at the junction of her smooth thighs, and he was mesmerised by the slight wisp of her pubic bush that hung like smoke over the cleft of her sex. 

Abigail was back to her confident self as she stood in her stockings and shoes in front of the handsome man. She knew the look; she may be years older than him, but she knew she had him and that he desired her. 

'You like it, hmm?' Abigail teased and held her heavy breasts in her palms. 'I want you to lick my kitty and make me cum,' she continued with no trace of self-consciousness at all. She was confident in her own sexual allure; she knew how to arouse a man since she'd never failed to excite Jimmy with her sexy clothes and potty mouth. 

The thought of her husband sent a quick sliver of guilt through Abigail, but she had made up her mind and wouldn't back out now. Then, Mick pulled his suit trousers down and showed Abigail his truly magnificent cock. 

'Oh my, Sir,' she lisped with feigned deference to his manhood. 'That looks like a very tasty cock, why not let me suck on it for you?' 

'Come and get it, baby,' Mick growled and Abigail swayed across the room with her hips swinging and her big breasts jiggling saucily. 

She took hold of Mick's thick phallus and kissed her lover eagerly. Then, she dropped to her knees in front of him and pulled his cock towards her face. 

'Shit,' Mick groaned as Abigail sucked hard at his angry red cock head. 'You can suck cock... Jesus,' he blasphemed. 

Abigail grinned up at Mick as best she could with her mouth full of his meat. She popped the head out from between her lips and licked the shaft from tip to balls and back again several times. 

'Come on lover,' Abigail whispered wantonly. 'Fuck my mouth, use me and then use my big tits.' 

Abigail's lewd language had the desired effect and soon Mick was pushing his cock rhythmically in and out of Abigail's mouth. Then she wrapped her big jugs around his cock shaft and urged him to fuck her cleavage. 

'Are you going to spunk on my tits, baby,' she cried. 'Cover my tits with it, come on; cover my big tits with all your hot stuff. I love it; I love it on my tits.' 

Mick couldn't hold back after Abigail's entreaty to cover her breasts in semen. He groaned loudly and felt the sublime relief as his seed spurted from the eye of his cock. Thick goo spattered onto Abigail's cheeks as Mick's ejaculation erupted powerfully and sprayed beyond the target zone. More thick spunk slapped onto Abigail's chin and then the lesser, dying spurts hit the offered skin of her breasts. 

Viscous cream slithered from Abigail's chin and fell in pools onto her big, already spattered breasts. 

'I love it when it hits my tits,' Abigail sighed and lay back on a sofa. She smeared the stuff into her chest and soft breasts as she spread her thighs for her lover. 'Lick my dirty cunt,' she offered obscenely. 'Make me come with your tongue.' 

Mick knelt in front of Abigail and held the heavy, hanging folds of her slippery labia apart with his fingers. Abigail was slightly embarrassed by what she considered to be the ugliness of her loose, drooping flaps. 

Mick however found their size an immense turn on and whispered almost in awe: 'Jesus, Abi, you're beautiful... every bit of you... beautiful.' He took a moment to study the hot, pink centre of Abigail's sex and then swirled his tongue around her opening. 

Abigail moaned as Mick worked his tongue against her with Ã©lan. He was widely experienced and knew how to please a woman orally. He flicked at Abigail's tight, pulsing clitty with the tip of his tongue and then pushed his finger into the soaking opening to her body. 

'Oh my fucking, God!' Abigail squealed as Mick probed deeper and deeper into her body. He pushed a second finger in beside the first, and then turned them inside Abigail to really excite her. 

There was no doubt that after minutes of this assault on her sensitive sex that Abigail was going to climax. Mick was rewarded with a lengthy and vociferous torrent of filth and obscenity as Abigail told him in no uncertain terms that was coming â€“ and that she was doing so now! 

'It's going to piss out of me. Yes, it's going to piss... I'm going to cum, oh, baby... finger me, lick me... My cunt's on fire.' 

Jimmy had taught his wife to use the filthiest language she could find to describe her sexual activity, and the habit was breaking through her subconscious now as Abigail surrendered to the bliss that flooded through her. Then Abigail's whole frame tightened as her orgasm ripped through her body and mind. She lost all control and just writhed and wriggled on Mick's fingers like a landed fish. 

Mick watched as syrupy juice literally squirted onto his hand and wrist. 'Fuck,' he thought, 'she really does piss it. ...The filthy bitch.' 

"Fuck me, please, fuck me now,' Abigail called as her climax began to subside. She squeezed her breasts and fingered her nipples so that her areola puckered in a visible display of her arousal. 

Mick lifted Abigail's legs and hooked the back's of her knees at the crook of his elbows. Abigail's cunt was angled up towards him now, and Mick pushed his renewed erection at the slippery opening to her sex. 

Mick noticed that Abigail's stocking tops were stained with patches of her own juice as he slid quickly into her accommodating body. The sight of Abigail's physical arousal was a huge turn on for Mick and he growled deeply as he plunged in and out of her slick pussy. He dipped his mouth to Abigail's breasts and sucked at her thick, elongated teats hungrily. 

'Fuck, Abi,' Mick grunted. 'You're the sexiest woman I've ever...' 

'Fucked?' Abigail finished for him. 'The best you've ever fucked? Is that it?' Abigail humped her broad hips up as her lover's cock speared her incessantly. 'Stick that big cock in me and really fuck me,' she urged through clenched teeth. 'Come on, use it on me, batter my nasty cunt, and make me sore... Go on, I want to feel you tomorrow when I move, when I walk. I want to feel that you've really fucked me.' 

'You dirty, depraved slut,' Mick groaned and then pounded at Abigail in an effort to satisfy her. He could hear the squelching of their coupling as his shaft stabbed in and out faster and faster. Abigail pulled her knees back to her shoulders and offered herself at a more acute angle as she strove to find her release. Her hips bucked and her buttocks lifted in a counter thrust to her lover's determined battering. 

Finally, Abigail groaned. She'd been manipulating her clit and squeezing her breasts as Mick fucked into her and now, finally, her climax broke. 

Abigail's moaning and writhing were a signal for Mick and he let loose with a huge groan of his own as his semen spat into Abigail's body. He felt his seed gush from his cock and he slumped down onto Abigail, spent. 

'That was so good, baby,' Abigail crooned when her own climax cooled. She held Mick close and kissed him tenderly as her breathing calmed. 'Nearly twenty-five years; it's been twenty-five years since another man has fucked me.' 

"You feel Okay?' Mick asked concerned. 

Abigail felt the hot tears spill from her eyes as she realised the full import of what she'd done. 

She'd been unfaithful to Jimmy, her darling husband. 

'I'll be fine, honest, just give me a minute... please.' 

Mick held Abigail close and let her tears dry. 

'Okay, now?' he asked a few minutes later. 

'Uh, huh, I'm fine.' Abigail dried her tears with the back of her hand. 'Phew, sorry,' she smiled sheepishly. 'I was just a little emotional, that's all. I'm fine now.' Abigail kissed Mick deeply and then murmured, 'I want to do it again, soon. Not tonight, I have to go, but soon. Can we?' 

Mick said nothing, but just nodded. 

Then, as an afterthought, and before she fully realised what she was asking, Abigail said: 'I want to have a threesome as well, with you... Can you arrange it?' 

Mick grinned as the light of inspiration flashed on in his head, and although he had no idea about how he was actually going to bring off the little scheme, he said: 'Sure,' and nodded. 'Sure I can... I know just the man.' 

Jimmy Again 

'How did it go?' I asked when I called 'Mick' the following day. 

'Yep,' he replied. 'You've got nothing to worry about. She's been faithful from day one... told me herself right off the bat, no problem at all.' 

'So... So what was all the flirting about?' I asked. 

'Just that - flirting.' The man chuckled down the phone line. 'She was having fun, seeing how far she could push it, how far she dare push it. She met Mick, had a drink and a meal, and then she said goodnight.' 

'Thanks,' I said, relieved. It had all been pointless. I'd had no cause for concern. What a fool I was to doubt Abigail in the first place. 'Well, thanks for your trouble; I'll send your cheque.' 

I was about to hang up when Mick spoke again: 'There is one thing you might like to know.' 

There was something in his tone that held me. I couldn't define it; there was just something there in his voice. 

'What's that?' I asked as my guts slid with angst. 

'The babe would love a threesome.' 

He laid it out as easily as that, even called Abi a "babe". Well, there was no faulting his taste... 

'Right,' I replied, not fully comprehending right there and then. I thought he was about to give me some devastating news, but this wasn't too bad. 

'Well,' he continued. 'I was wondering ...if.' 

'If, what?' I asked although by now I had a fairly strong inkling what the "If" would be. 

'Well... uh... you know.' 

'Do I?' 

He sighed; the sound was loud in the earpiece of the phone. 

'Okay,' he said. 'It was just a thought. Your wife... I mean, she's really sexy... Well, I hope you're not offended...' 

Offended? Not at all, if this man thought my wife was attractive and sexy, well all the good to me. I was a lucky man. 

'You'd want to be part of the deal,' I said at last. 'If we went for a threesome?' 

'Oh, God, for sure,' he said eagerly. 'In fact,' he went on, 'I was thinking...' 

I smiled to myself. 'Go on.' 

'Well, I could use the phone. Tell her I've got someone in mind for a three- way. See if she bites.' 

My stomach flipped at his suggestion and I felt that weird mix of jealousy and arousal again deep in my guts. 

'You, me and Abigail?' I croaked, my throat suddenly dry. 

'Oh yeah!' Mick said. 'That'd be so good. To see her being taken from both ends...' 

His enthusiasm was lost on me at that moment. I was caught up with my own vivid images of my beautiful wife being speared by another man's cock. I could see her face filled with wonder while she accepted a lover between her thighs. I could hear her moans and sighs when he fucked her. I could hear her voice urging her lover to fuck her...' 

'So?' My reverie was shattered by Mick's voice in my ear. 'What do you think? Shall I try?' 

'Yes.' I hung up, surprised at what I'd done. What wheels had I set in motion? What would be let loose by opening the lid to Pandora's Box? 

I didn't expect Abigail to take the bait. After all, she'd met Mick that time and he'd reported back that she'd been faithful since we'd married. Did the threesome idea really intrigue her to such a depth? I wonder why she'd never brought it up with me. I wracked my brain trying to think of a reason why she'd be prepared to go with Mick... And a stranger! I'd never considered that aspect. My wife was going to fuck another man for the first time in almost twenty-five years, but not only that, on top of the infidelity she was going to compound the sin by taking a complete stranger as well! 

Okay, so the second man wouldn't be a stranger, but Abigail didn't know that. She thought she'd be fucking one man she barely knew and the other... He'd be completely alien to her. 

That now familiar feeling was back in my stomach. The slut, that brazen bitch... I was furious at her for her duplicity, but once again, I was turned on by the whole sordid affair. So much so that I was compelled to masturbate fiercely, and all the time I was pulling my cock I was picturing my wife, dressed for sex and being used by two men. 

My semen spurted from me and I cried out with the relief of it. If this was the effect mere imagination could have then I could barely begin to imagine what state I'd be in if I lived the fantasy. 

Confessions 

I spent the following days in a virtual trance. I watched Abigail constantly and leapt upon every facet of her behaviour, devouring it in a frenzy of analytical thought. I was watching for clues, sniffing for a scent as I waited for some sign that Mick had made the call and that the sordid appointment was set. 

How Abigail failed to notice my agitation was unbelievable, but perhaps she was as distracted as I was. I assumed that to contemplate infidelity after nearly a quarter of a century of marriage, and with two men to boot, rather took a person's eye off the ball so to speak. 

Then came the moment that Abigail told me the bare faced lie. 

'The girls are out again on Saturday, Jimmy,' she said on a Wednesday evening. 

'Really?' I replied. 'Are you planning on going too?' 

'Well, I hadn't planned to but...' 

There it was done, she was preparing the groundwork for her duplicitous plans and she'd delivered the lie with no outward tremor at all. 

I moved to my wife and put my arms around her waist from behind. I gently nuzzled the back of her neck and rubbed my fingertips against her nipples through her blouse. I wanted to make her feel bad, I wanted her to feel as guilty as sin, and I planned on doing this by paying her lots of attention. I planned to be as caring and as attentive as I could be so that she'd vile at her betrayal... I wanted her to pay. 

As Abigail sighed at the touch of my lips against her throat, I slowly lifted her skirt and kneaded her bare buttocks. I cranked up the pressure by gently biting her throat, barely grazing her soft skin with the edge of my teeth in the way I knew would turn her on. 

I turned my wife around so she was facing me and pulled the hem of the blouse free of her skirt. After baring her midriff by undoing the buttons, I knelt to showered Abigail's tummy with feathery kisses. She sighed again and ran her fingers through my hair while I continued to kiss her stomach. I then kissed my way up to Abigail's mouth via her smooth, creamy breasts that spilled over the top of her bra cups. Abigail's tongue pushed into my mouth as soon as my lips touched hers and I felt her fingers brush my cock as we kissed. 

Abigail unzipped me and my thick, hard cock was soon in her tight grip. 

'Do you want me?' she asked; her breath quickening as she stroked my penis. 

'Always, babe,' I whispered. 'I always want you.' 

'Take me now,' Abigail groaned. 'I'm wet for you, do it to me here.' 

I slipped my hand down between Abigail's legs and found her sodden. I turned her around again so that she was facing away from me and then pushed her shoulders as a sign that she should bend forward slightly. Abigail gripped the side of the kitchen table and pushed her hot derriere out in invitation. I quickly hiked her skirt up around her hips and offered the blunt tip of my cock to her soaking sex. 

One push and I was inside her and I heard my wife gasp as I forced myself deeper. I was no longer the gentle, caring, attentive husband. I was an animal whose only desire was to use the woman on the end of my cock. I grabbed my wife's hips and fucked into her brutally, heedless of the fact that she wouldn't be entirely receptive at this early stage of our coupling. 

Abigail cried out as I fucked her hard and fast, but I couldn't have cared less at that point. I wanted to punish her for her planned betrayal. 

'Jimmy, please,' Abigail whimpered. 'It hurts; please... slow down, not so hard.' 

'It hurts does it?' I groaned as the insanity rose in me. 'I'll make it hurt.' 

I pounded at Abigail's body with harsh, vigorous strokes. I was intent on teaching her a lesson. What that lesson was, I had no idea myself. I was just taking out my frustration and anger on her in the only way I could think of. The only problem was that as I forced myself into Abigail's body, I began to babble. I had no idea what I was saying, that was until I heard myself say: 'If I'm hurting you now, you'll be no good for a threesome.' 

That word, "threesome", penetrated the darkness of my lunacy like a beacon. Almost as soon as I uttered the word I realised what I'd let slip and immediately ceased my assault upon my wife's sex. 

My cock slid out of Abigail and she turned to look at me, her blouse flapping open and her skirt still rucked up to her hips. 

'What?' she said quietly with wide eyes and an open mouth. 'Why did you say that? And why did you use me so harshly?' 'What's going on?' 

'I... I...' There was no way out, no excuse I could use, so I told the truth. 

Abigail pulled her skirt down to cover her modesty as I began to speak. She sat down on the small sofa we keep in the kitchen and listened, incredulous in parts, to the whole sorry tale of how I'd engineered the meeting with the man she knew as Mick. I'd told her how hurt I was that she was lying to me about Saturday night and that I knew she was planning to fuck two men... although one of them was me. I left nothing out, spared her no detail until, finally, I fell silent. 

'But...' Abigail started, but was unable find the words. 'But... how could you hope to pull it off...' She shook her head as though clearing her thoughts. 'Do you think I'd have fucked you if you'd just turned up out of the blue?' She looked at me. 'I'd have been humiliated... Humiliated and scared... and I would've felt stupid...' Abigail stared at me as though seeing me for the first time. As though I was no longer the man she'd been married to for all this time, and I suppose I no longer was the same man. Let's face it; what sort of man pulls a stunt like this on his own wife? The woman he loves? 

Then Abigail hit me with the big one. 

With tears rolling down her cheeks she confessed. 

'You stupid, stupid bastard,' she sobbed. 'If you hadn't... If you hadn't played such an insanely idiotic trick...' Abigail broke into a real fit of sobbing now. Her shoulders heaved and her head fell forward while the big, fat tears plopped wetly onto the kitchen floor. 'I never would have met him... Never would have slept with him...'  

===

That was like a physical slap in the face for me. Slept with him? She'd fucked him? My world spun and I felt nauseous. 

'You slept with him?' A gasp from me. 

Abigail nodded. 'It was only him, Jimmy, I swear. He was the only one that I've ever...' 

'But you were going to do it again... You were going to fuck him again, only this time there would be two of them!' 

Abigail didn't answer, there was nothing to say. In spite of Abigail's infidelity I felt responsible. If I hadn't doubted her in the first place, and it appeared that my doubt was originally unfounded, then none of this would have taken place. If I hadn't put the temptation to Abigail, almost rubbed her nose in it, then we would still be emotionally intact and our marriage complete. I looked into the desolate eyes of my beautiful wife. I still loved her. 

What a huge fucking mess.
