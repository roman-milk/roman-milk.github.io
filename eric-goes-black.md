Eric Goes Black
===============

===

This isn't about a white guy falling for a black whore on anything even close to that. 

 It's just an idea that come to me. We'll follow Eric as he leaves college and moves into life, till... 

 ***** 

 Eric is 6 ft 2 in tall and weighs about 215. He has brown hair, hazel eyes and sports a thick nine inch cock. His major is computer science, his minor is in business and he is on the wrestling and boxing teams. He has one of those exercise machines that he can work all muscles groups. Every morning he wakes early and works out for an hour. With a good diet and regular exercise he maintains a chiseled body. 

 Eric is in his senior year at UCLA. His professors wonder if he swallowed a mother board. This last year he has been writing several software packages. He is carrying a solid 4.0 grade average. There are three months left before he gets his Masters. 

 Even in high school he was a babe magnet. It was his nice personality and his good looks that did it. Word soon got around that he was a nice guy. If a girl wanted to have a good time and feel special all they had to do was go on a date with him. This was easier said than done. He was very selective in whom he dated. He stayed away from the run of the mill sluts that were all over the place. He only dated the ones that could hold an intelligent conversation and, of course, were hot. 

 It's Friday afternoon and Eric is reviewing the video he took of the lecture in his computer science class. His phone buzzes. 

 "Hey, Gary. What's up?" 

 "Alpha's having a kegger tonight. Wanna go? I can pick you up." 

 "Sounds good. I haven't been out for a while. And I don't want you to pick me up. I remember what happened last time." 

 'Oh, yeah. I fell in love and left you there." 

 "Well, at least your memory is going on you. I'll see you there about seven. OK?" 

 "OK, bye." 

 "Later, bud." 

 ****************** 

 Eric is drawing his second beer from the keg. He turns and sees two women walk in. One is a short brunette and one is blonde. He knows the short brunette, but he has never seen the blonde before. She looks like something that dreams are made of. 

 He nudges Gary. 

 "Holy shit. Look at the blonde with Emily. She is fucking hot. Do you know her." 

 "Wow. You're right and no, I don't know her. You gonna make a move on her." 

 "I'm not sure. The night is young." 

 He just stands looking at her. He watches her eyes scan the room and she stops, looking at him. She looks away and he watches her walk toward the table where the bar is set up. He sees the gentle sway of her unrestrained breasts and the roll of her ass cheeks. Her ass is just a little wider than perfect. He thinks to himself, 'If she ever gets that ass moving the laws of physics will never let it stop'. He feels a stirring in his groin. He decides to make contact with her and walks up beside her at the bar. 

 "Hi, if you like white wine, I recommend that one. It's my favorite." 

 She just looks at him. 

 "You trying to get me drunk and take me upstairs?" 

 He looks into her eyes for a few seconds and answers, "You could have just said, 'No thank you,' but I guess that's not your style." 

 He turns and walks away. 

 She finds Emily and asks her, "Do you know that guy there in the blue shirt?" 

 "Sure do. That's Eric. He's a really nice guy. All the girls are after him." 

 "Oh shit. I was just rude to him. I may have hurt his feelings. I feel terrible." 

 "That's a shame. You would be lucky to hook up with him. You'll never meet a nicer guy. Plus, as you can see, he's a hunk and I hear he's hung." 

 "Come with me. I need to apologize. I need some moral support." 

 They walk up to Eric and Emily touches him on the shoulder. He turns. 

 "Eric, I'd like to introduce Tina. Tina, meet Eric." 

 "We've already met." 

 "Eric, I want to apologize. You didn't deserve that rude remark. I'm sorry." 

 "It's OK. I may have come on a little strong." 

 "No, you didn't. It's just that at these frat parties it seems to the the chosen sport to get some girl drunk and take advantage of them. Please forgive me." 

 "Let's start over. Hi, I'm Eric. You look thirsty, may I get you a glass of wine?" 

 "Hi, Eric. Nice to meet you and yes, I'd love some wine." 

 They both chuckle. 

 "I guess we got off on the wrong foot." 

 "Yeah, but it's ok. It's happened before to both of us, I'm sure." 

 "Do you study here?" 

 'Yes, I'm a senior." 

 "What's your major.?" 

 "Business. I'm going for my MBA. What's yours.?" 

 "I'm a geek. Computer science." 

 'Funny. You don't look like a geek." 

 "Really. What do they look like?" 

 "Umm, Dark horn rimmed glasses. A plastic pocket protector full of pens in their shirt pocket and they're short. They're afraid of girls and can't talk about anything but computers." 

 "Well, I hit on one of those. I like to talk about computers, but I'm not afraid of girls. I don't wear glasses and my pens are in my back pack. I guess your assessment is wrong." 

 "Don't put me on. You're not typical. What do you do besides play with computers?" 

 "I'm on the wrestling and boxing teams." 

 "Hmmm. Impressive. A jock geek." 

 They both chuckle. 

 "You look like the MBA type. Beautiful, confident and intelligent. You should do well." 

 "Thanks. That nice to hear." 

 "I've been hitting the books pretty hard lately. I need to get out and shake out some of the cobwebs. How about we go out for dinner and maybe a little dancing." 

 "That sounds nice. Give me your phone and I'll give you my number." 

 She puts her number in his phone as Emily walks up. 

 "We need to go, Tina. I have some homework to do and an early class." 

 "OK, I'm ready. Eric, call me tomorrow and let me know what time." 

 "You're on, Tina. Take care." 

 ********************** 

 After finishing dinner, Eric and Tina are finishing off a carafe of wine. 

 "Eric, I hope you don't have a girlfriend that will be upset by your going out with me." 

 He chuckles. 

 "Well, I don't think that will be a problem. I broke up with her about three weeks ago." 

 "I see. What was the problem?" 

 "She started making noises about marriage and babies. I have no plans on getting married till I finish school and get a job. I'll be living with my parents till I get going. She didn't exactly like it when I told her that." 

 "I can see where that would scare a lot of guys off." 

 "It's not like I never plan on getting married or having kids. It's just not in my immediate plans." 

 "Am I going to have an irate boyfriend coming after me. I imaging you have guys hitting on you all the time. You're very beautiful." 

 "No, you're safe. My last guy had to go back home. His parents wanted him to come home and help with the family business. He finished the classes he was taking and went back to Germany." 

 "I hope he didn't break your heart." 

 "He didn't. I knew right off that he would be leaving and we both knew I wouldn't go with him. We were more like good friends with benefits." 

 Nine O'clock rolls around and they hear the dance band tuning up. They, along with a few other couples move to tables near the dance floor. The band quickly starts off with a fast set and Eric pulls her to the floor. They dance to two songs and go back to their table. Eric orders another carafe of wine. 

 "You have some pretty good moves, Tina. You're showing up all the other girls here." 

 "You do pretty well too, for a computer geek." 

 "That's a jock geek, if you don't mind." 

 A slow set starts and Tina takes his hand and pulls him up. He smiles. She moves into his arms and holds him close. He feels her sleek body against his. After a few minutes she feels his half hard cock against her stomach. It's nothing new to her. It happens all the time. 

 He changes her position and moves her till his thigh is on her mound. He pulls her against him and as the slow number proceeds. She doesn't notice till she feels herself getting stimulated. She snuggles closer enjoying the feeling. He holds her there and the feeling increases. She feels a little moisture on her pussy lips. 

 She leans back and looks at him. He can see it in her eyes. He leans down and kisses her. She gasps and returns the kiss. 

 Before she realizes what's happening she finds herself pushing against his thigh. He breathing increases as she pushes harder against him. He leans down and kisses her again. She pushes against him as she feels an orgasm coming on. She tries to hide it but it hits her causing her to twitch and moan. He holds her up as her knees go weak. She looks up at him. 

 "You bastard. You made me cum." 

 "Tell me you didn't like it." 

 "I did. That's why I called you a bastard. I wasn't expecting that." 

 "Sneaky jock geek. Huh?" 

 They both chuckle. 

 The song ends and they go back to their table. 

 "Excuse me. I need to go to the ladies room." 

 He leans over and whispers, "Bring me your panties." 

 "You are a bastard, asking me that." 

 "A bastard, sneaky, jock geek." 

 With a smile she gets up and leaves. He wonders if she will give them to him. 

 While she is in the ladies room, she thinks. 'This guy is good. Nice personality, nice body and a dirty mind. He is going to be fun. She decides to play with him a little. She leaves with her panties in her hand. 

 She sits at the table and with one hand pulls him to her for a kiss. As she tries to tickle his tonsils she puts her panties in his hand. She leans back and smiles at him. He holds them over his nose and takes a deep breath. 

 "Mmmm, woman smell. Nothing better." 

 "Eric, you are a bad boy." 

 "I try to be good. Sometimes I don't do so well." 

 They dance two more slow sets. He holds her on his thigh and she comes once more for him. 

 "We need to go before I embarrass my self. I don't want everyone seeing anything running down my legs." 

 Eric pays the tab and they leave. 

 As they're riding to Tina's place she puts her hand on his knee. 

 "I had a good time tonight, Eric. You're nice to be with." 

 "I did too. Was it nice enough for a repeat?" 

 "Sure. Wanna try for next weekend." 

 "How about dinner and a movie." 

 "That will work." 

 They get to her place and get out. They walk to her door and he takes her in his arms. Their lips meet in a gentle kiss. He licks her lips. She catches her breath and opens her mouth. His tongue slides in and finds hers. He moans and pulls her against him. His hand slides down to her ass and he pulls up her dress. He holds her naked ass cheeks. She pushes against him. She moans and their tongues continue playing. She finally pulls back and looks at him. 

 "Easy, big guy. I can be had but not on the first date." 

 He smiles and nods. 

 "I understand. It's OK." 

 "Call me during the week. We can meet for lunch." 

 "How does Wednesday sound?" 

 "That's good. I'll be expecting your call. 

 He reaches into his pocket to get her panties. 

 "Keep'em." 

 He gives her a quick kiss and walks to his car. He waits for her to go in. Just before she closes the door she turns and smiles at him. She waves and closes the door. He drives home with a boner and a smile. 

 ****************** 

 Wednesday, Eric finishes his last morning class. He sends Tina a text. 

 'Now?' 

 Her answer. 

 'The Bean' 

 His answer. 

 'k' 

 He enters 'The Bean' into his GPS search feature and it pops up. Fifteen minutes later he pulls into the parking lot. He walks in and spots her sitting way in the back. She is at a table by herself but is turned talking to two girls at the next table. He walks up, pulls her up and hugs her. He plants a kiss on her luscious lips. She gasps and returns it. One of the girls at the table elbows Tina in the butt. Tina turns and looks at two smiling faces. 

 "Eric, meet Ashley and Karen. Girls, meet Eric." 

 "Hi girls. Nice to meet you." 

 In unison..."Hi Eric. Nice to meet you too." 

 Karen raises her hand. Tina catches on and they exchange a high five. Eric chuckles. 

 They sit and Eric notices the two girls are quiet. He suspects their big ears are listening. 

 "Tell me a little about yourself. Where you from?" 

 "My parents live in San Francisco. My Dad is a lawyer and my Mom is a court recorder. She runs one of those funny typewriters and spends my Dad's money. She has over 200 pairs of shoes." 

 'I've heard of women like that. Did you inherit that from her?" 

 Laughing, she says. "No. I only have about ten." 

 "I have four." 

 "Typical guy. Where are you from?" 

 "San Diego. My Dad owns a marketing and advertising company. My Mom is a Department Store manager. She's in charge of all the womens stuff." 

 "How did you end up here? There are lots of good schools up north." 

 "There's a professor here I wanted. He has a great reputation. I had to be first in line to get into his class." 

 "He's that good huh?" 

 "What do you plan on doing after you graduate?" 

 "I'll probably hook up with a good tech company. I've written some software packages I plan on marketing. I haven't made any hard choices yet. I'll do some research and see what's out there." 

 "Sounds like you have it all planned out." 

 "Yeah, I've always believed in setting goals." 

 "Any other goals you have set up?" 

 "One more. Just getting to know you." 

 She smiles but doesn't say anything. 

 "Speaking of getting to know you. Are we on for Saturday night? I remember something about dinner and a movie." 

 "Yes, we're on, but why don't you come over. I'll make dinner for us. Dress is casual. And before you say anything, Yes, I can cook. My Mom made sure of that." 

 "Some home cooking? I really like that idea. I'll bring the wine. White or red?" 

 "How about red. I make a mean lasagna." 

 "Red it is. My favorite red is a good Burgundy. I like that Burgundy bite." 

 "I like a good Claret, but Burgundy is good too." 

 "I hate to cut this short, but I gotta run. I've got a class soon and one of my professors is giving us a twenty question test tomorrow. I need to bone up for it." 

 They get up to leave. Eric pays the check and they walk out. He gives her a quick kiss and walks away. She stands there with a smile watching him walk away. She knows he is playing with her. He knew she wanted more than a quick kiss. She chuckles and leaves. 

 ******************* 

 Saturday at Tina's. 

 On the way to Tina's Eric stops at a wine shop. He asks the clerk for a top of the line Burgundy. It sets him back $150. He also stops at a florist and gets a bouquet of flowers. 

 He rings her bell and the door opens. She looks at the wine and flowers. 

 "Wow. Nice one. Flowers and wine. You really know how to spoil a girl. He notices that she is wearing an old Mickey Mouse t shirt. He sees a hint of nipples and wonders if she is wearing panties. It comes down just enough to cover her ass cheeks. 

 "Come on in. Dinner is almost ready. You decant the wine and I'll finish up." 

 They are both sitting back sipping their wine. 

 "Well, that was the best lasagna I ever had. Your Mom did a good job teaching you how to cook. Tell her thanks the next time you talk to her." 

 "Thank you. I'm glad you liked it. Let's go in the other room. I rented a movie." 

 She puts a chick flick disc in the player and they sit on the sofa. He puts his arm around her shoulder and she snuggles in. About halfway through the movie he lifts her chin and kisses her. She sighs and gives him her tongue. The make out for a while and his hand finds her breast. She pushes her hard nipples into his hand. He rolls her nipple between his thumb and finger. It swells up to the size of a strawberry. He finds the other and tweaks it up too. 

 She breaks the kiss and sits astride his lap. She pulls his shirt up and off with a big smile on her face. 

 "Mmmm. You're pretty. Nice chest there." 

 He pulls her t shirt up and off. 

 "Mmmm. Nice chest you have too." 

 She leans against his chest and kisses him. Her tongue tries to find his tonsils and her firm breasts are pressing on his chest. Eric hangs on to her naked ass cheeks. 

 Suddenly she stands up and pulls him up. She grabs his hand and leads him to the bedroom. The covers are pulled back and two candles are burning. The odor of cinnamon hits his nose. She quickly opens his pants and pulls them down. His boxers follow. She kneels in front of him. She holds his cock in one hand and his balls in the other. 

 She kisses his cock head and gives it a little lick. 

 "Hi big boy. I have plans for you. I've never had one as big as you are. You're going to find some new territory." 

 She starts sucking and licking his cock, bringing him up quickly. She wants to make him cum so he can last longer the second time. Eric's knees start going weak and she pushes him back on the bed. 

 She smiles at him. 

 "I want you to cum in my mouth. It's been way too long since I swallowed a good load." 

 "Take it. It's been a while for me too." 

 She starts to work on him. It's not long before he is moaning and groaning. She tries to throat him but he is too big. She takes all she can and soon she feels it swelling. She speeds up, ready for it. 

 He groans and thrusts his hips up. She takes the first shot down her throat. She pulls back and holds her lips just behind the head. Her tongue rubs the sensitive spot just under the head. Eric pumps rope after rope into her mouth. She stays with it till she has the last drop. She slips off it and sits up. She leans her head back and swishes his cum around in her mouth. A shiver goes through her body as she enjoys the creamy texture and flavor. 

 She swallows and shows him her empty mouth. 

 "I hope you don't have anything planned for the rest of the weekend. I'm going to be wanting some more of that." 

 He chuckles. 

 "I hope so. I'm free till Monday morning." 

 She moves up and snuggles against his chest. She gently plays with his nipples with her nails. 

 'That's a nice cock you have there. It's pretty and bigger than any I've had. This is going to be a fun weekend." 

 "It's off to a great start. That's for sure. You're really good with that mouth." 

 He waits a few minutes and decides it's her turn. He starts with neck, then her nipples, working his way down. His hand finds her wet mound. She is more than ready. He kisses around her thighs and mound, waiting for her to open her legs. She slowly opens them and her knees go up. 

 He attacks her pussy and before long she has her first orgasm of the evening. She holds his head to her and he brings her up to another. He slips two fingers in her wet pussy, curling them up to find her G spot. She moans for him as he finds it. He brings her passion up as he licks and sucks on her labia. He feels her orgasm coming on and makes his move. He rubs two fingers on her G spot and sucks up her clit. She thrusts up against him, screams and a huge orgasm rips through her body. He waits for her to come down and he gives her another. Her screams fill the room. 

 Before she can fully recover he moves up and places his cock head against her pussy lips. He looks into her eyes. 

 He pushes his cock head and it spreads her pussy lips and pops in. She moans as her stretches her out. 

 "Oh fuck yes. Open me up with that monster." 

 She humps up, taking more and more in. He lets her control it. 

 Finally after a couple of minutes he is balls deep in her. His cock touches her cervix and she cums for him. 

 "Oh god. Oh. Oh. Full of big hard cock. Yes. Yes. Yes." 

 He pulls almost all the way out and feeds it to her again. It touches her cervix and she comes again. Her legs go around his ass and her arms go around his chest. 

 "Fuck me, baby. Fuck me hard. It's been way too long. Make me feel like a woman." 

 He takes long slow strokes building her up to another climax. He feels her pussy muscles clamp on him and she cums again. 

 "Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes. Yes. Yes. Fuck me. fuck me." 

 He speeds up and she matches him thrust for thrust. He feels a stirring in his loins. 

  

 

 

===

"I'm almost there, baby. Are you ready?" 

 "Fuck yes. Cum in me. Fill me with your cum. Fuck me. Fuck me." 

 Her pussy muscles clamp down on him and his cock flares. His cock starts pumping his cum in her. She cries out and holds her pelvis bone against his. She squeezes every drop all over her cervix. She holds him in her embrace till his cock goes limp. The feeling of being a woman fills her and a sigh escapes her lips. She rolls him off and snuggles up to him, enjoying the afterglow. 

 "Mmmm. Nice, Nice, Nice." 

 "I think I have a cuddler on my hands." 

 "Yes, you do. Too many cuddles are not enough." 

 "You know, babe. If we keep this up we need to be exclusive. I don't want to be a banana in the bunch." 

 "The way you make me cum, we are defiantly exclusive. You're certainly enough man for me. Let me show you what exclusive means." 

 "She reaches down and starts jacking his cock. She licks and sucks it up to full hard. She looks at him and smiles as he moves up over him. She lines it up with her pussy and slowly drops on him. 

 "This cowgirl is gonna ride you to a standstill. Hang on." 

 He watches her breasts flopping around as she starts riding him. He get a hold on each nipple and tweaks them. She squeals and rides him harder. Her head falls back and an orgasm flows through her body. Eric pushes up and bumps her clit adding to her pleasure. She moans and keeps riding him. 

 "Ride me, baby. Make me cum in that hot cowgirl pussy." 

 "Oh fuck. Big hard cock. Riding a big hard cock. Yes. Yes." 

 She rides him for a few more minutes and feels his cock swell. 

 "Give it to me, baby. Give me that hot cum. Fill this cowgirl up." 

 His cock flares and the both cry out in mutual orgasm. She falls, gasping on his chest. He wraps his arms around her and pulls her fulls breasts to him. 

 "Oh my god, what a fucker you are. You make me cum so many times. I can get used to this in a hurry." 

 She rolls off and snuggles up to his side. He reaches down and pulls the covers over them. The fall asleep in each others arms. 

 The next morning, while having a naked breakfast, they agree to meet every weekend possible and lunch at The Bean every Wednesday. Everything goes just fine for the next three weeks, until... 

 Wednesday morning, Eric is sitting in his last class of the morning listening intently and recording the lecture. A woman walks into the classroom and whispers something to the professor. He dismisses the class and hurries out. 

 Eric decides to go to The Bean as there is only about forty five minutes till his meeting with Tina. He plans on studying till she shows up. He closes his laptop and shuts off his recorder. 

 As he pulls into the parking lot he sees Tina walking out of The Bean. She is hanging on the arm of a very handsome black guy. She is holding his arm against her breast. She is looking up at him, laughing and talking excitedly. He stops and watches. She is so intent on her conversation with the guy that she doesn't see him. The stop at a car near where he stopped. She turns to him and throws both arms around his neck. Their lips meet in a passionate kiss and she hooks her leg around his. After a few seconds they break the kiss and the guy gets in his car. Just before Tina turns to go back to The Bean she sees Eric looking at her. Her mouth drops open and her hand covers her mouth. Shock registers in her eyes. Eric pulls away leaving a patch of burned rubber on the pavement. 

 He tries to keep his anger in control. 

 'So much for exclusive you lying bitch.' 

 His anger builds and he has to pull into a shopping center parking lot. He knows he shouldn't drive in this condition. While he is sitting there, gripping the steering wheel, his cell phone goes off. He knows who it is. He lets it go to voice mail. He finally calms down and his white knuckles return to normal. All kinds of angry thoughts run through his mind as he drives home. 

 He pulls into his driveway and goes inside. He grabs a beer from the fridge and sits in his recliner. His phone goes off two more times. He deletes the calls without listening to them. 

 They both knew they would never be a couple. They both planned on going back home after graduation. The really liked each other and the sex was off the scale but they weren't in love. The last thing he needs is girlfriend problems. 

 Knowing it's over with her he calms down. He waits, knowing she will be there soon. 

 Fifteen minutes later his doorbell rings. He opens the door. She tries to hug him but he just stands there with his arms at his sides. 

 "Please, Eric. Can we talk?" 

 "Sure. But noting is going to change. We're done." 

 "Please, let me explain." 

 "OK, you have ten minutes." 

 She sits on the sofa, across from Eric. 

 "I met Brian at freshman orientation. We hit it off right away and started dating. I was a virgin and he was my first. We have been seeing each other ever since. We dated others but we got together every week or so. I couldn't stay away from him. The thrill of having sex with a black man was the hook. We both knew we could never be a couple. I was going to continue having sex with him till I graduated. Then you came along. After I was rude to you when we first met, Emily told me what a nice guy you were. Our first time I came so many times I was hooked. I figured I could have both of you till graduation. I still want that. 

 "I can't do that, Tina. When we hooked up we agreed to be exclusive. I told you I wouldn't stand in line. You were laying there with my cum in you when you agreed. You lied knowing it wasn't true. 

 "I know, Eric. I hope you can forgive me for that." 

 "That's not the worst of it. You're not exclusive with him? Is once every week or so all the sex he wants? Do you know who else he is sleeping with?" 

 "I don't know who he sleeps with. I trust him that he's clean." 

 "You might, but I don't trust him any further than I can throw my car. Now I have to go to the doctor and get tested for STD. Now do you see why we're done. I can't and won't continue this. It's over." 

 "I'm sorry, Eric. I guess I was just being selfish. I won't bother you again." 

 She gets up and walks out of his life. 

 Two days later Eric shows up at the campus clinic. He fills out the paperwork as to who he has been with. He breathes a sigh of relief when he gets an all clear. 

 He finishes his studies and graduates cum laude with a 3.9 average for his Masters Degree. He closes up his rental house. Just before he pulls away he sends Gary a text. 

 "See you in Dago." 

 Gary answers. 

 "K" 

 ******************** 

 Six months later Eric and secured an entry level job with a leading IT company. He has just finished his three month probation period and is scheduled to meet with his boss. He decides he will make a move during that meeting. 

 The next morning he walks into his bosses office. 

 "Hi, Eric. Come on in and take a seat. 

 Hi, John. I've been looking forward to this meeting. 

 "Your probation period is up and we need to talk. We like your work and we're prepared to offer you a one year contract. Your starting salary will be $5K per month with full health and a company car. 

 'That's a nice offer, but I have one for you. I have a software package you might be interested in. Let's hold off on that contract till you've looked it over. We can meet again in a week." 

 He reaches in his briefcase and pulls out a five disc packet and slides it across the desk. 

 'Have you're people look it over let me know what you think. After you've looked at that package we can talk some more." 

 "You sound pretty sure of yourself." 

 Eric smiles and says, "And by the way, I have a copy write on that package." 

 "OK, Eric. Let me look this over and I'll call you." 

 Two days later John calls Eric to his office. 

 "Hi, Eric. Have a seat." 

 "So, how do you like my software?" 

 "To put it mildly, I like it and Fred likes it. He want to meet with you to see what you can work out." 

 "Sounds good. I hoped you would like it." 

 "Fred wants to see you this afternoon at two. Be ready." 

 "Thanks, John. I owe you one." 

 "Good luck with him. He is tough." 

 "I'm confident we can work something out." 

 2 pm finds Eric sitting in the company owners waiting room. Eric is admiring his hot receptionist. She looks like she could suck the chrome off a ball hitch. She is proudly sporting a pair of DD's. It seems that Fred like the finer things in life. He files that fact away in his mental data base. 

 "Eric, Mr. Larsen will see you now. Please, go right in." 

 "Thank you." 

 He walks in and sees a distinguished looking guy sitting behind a huge desk. He looks to be about forty five and appears to be in good shape. His secretary is sitting in a chair next to his desk. She is as hot as the receptionist out front. Fred greets him with a firm handshake. 

 "Hi, Eric. Nice to finally meet you. This is my secretary Amber. Amber, meet Eric." 

 "Hi, Eric." 

 "Good afternoon, maam. Nice to met you." 

 "Let's cut to the chase. I like this software package. I see you have a copy write on it. I'm prepared to make you an offer. I'll buy it outright for $50k and offer you a two year contract for double your current salary." 

 "That's a nice offer, but I was looking for a little more. Let's do this. I'll give you a license to market it and I want fifteen percent of the action. Also, I want a $100K signing bonus on our agreement for the software. I expect you will make a few million if you market it nation wide and more if you go international. I want my proceeds from the software to be deposited in an offshore account." 

 "You drive a hard bargain, Eric. Let me run that by accounting and legal and we'll see." 

 "I have more to offer too. You know that if you aren't making innovations in this business, you're going backwards. You need information. I can get that for you." 

 "What kind of information are we talking about?" 

 "Give me two days off and I'll give you a sample. We can talk after that." 

 "I like you, Eric. You are what I call a "go getter". You have two days. Come back and impress me." 

 He shakes his hand and walks out. He has a huge grin on his face. 

 Over the next two days Eric starts digging. The first thing he checks on is company competitors. He finds four. He suspects they are using the local cable company for an ISP. He hacks in and finds them. He gets in and looks around. Two aren't doing much. Just writing builds on existing stuff they are marketing. 

 He finds Software Solutions. He starts snooping in their system. He finds that they have one programmer that is far above the others. This guy is brilliant. He hacks into his computer and finds some interesting things. He is writing some software packages on his home laptop. He suspects that he isn't happy just writing builds for them. He probably knows how good he is. His salary is about $80k per year. He also has a external hard drive loaded with porn. 

 "Got him." 

 He checks his email and finds nothing. He has no girlfriend. He seems to be a loner. All the better. 

 He decides to check on Fred. He gets into his work computer and finds he runs all of his personal stuff through it. He looks at the credit cards. He finds three. One is his and one is his wife's. The third one is interesting. It has charges from Fredrick's of Hollywood, some jewelry stores and some from the Hilton. 

 "Holy shit. He has a mistress." 

 He checks into his wife's card. Not much there. Just high end department stores and the usual women stuff. By the amounts he suspects she has closets that they could rent out to a small family. One room would hold all the shoes. He finds another account in her name only. It has just a little over $100K in it. Looks like she is putting a little away for a rainy day. He notices one check written on it to a PI. 

 "Oh fuck. She is onto him." 

 He checks the date of the check. It seems the PI was in a hurry to cash it. It came in the next day. 

 He goes into the PI's computer. He finds her file. It seems that Fred isn't keeping up on his homework. She suspects he is cheating. He is planning on wiring their house and putting a GPS on his car. He hasn't started anything yet. He knows Fred will be pissed about him checking into his personal stuff, but he needs to know about what he found. 

 The two days are up and Eric is admiring Fred's receptionist again. Her phone buzzes. 

 "Go right in, Eric." 

 "Thank you." 

 "Ok, Eric, sit down and impress me." 

 "Ok, first off I did some checking on your competitors. There are three. Two aren't worth worrying about. They are just writing builds on their own stuff. They have nothing in the pipe line. Software Solutions is another story. The have a hot programmer. He is good. He is working on some good stuff that will make them some big bucks." 

 "OK, what can we do to stop them." 

 "Not much. The best thing to do is hire him." 

 "Do you think we can get him?" 

 "Yep. He has a hook." 

 "We can lure him away with more money and some pussy." 

 Fred and Amber burst out laughing. 

 "What the hell?" 

 "His home computer is loaded up with interracial porn. We just hook him up with a black chick and he is ours. I noticed you have some, shall we say, entertainment consultants. Hook him up with one of them. All she has to do is keep him happy and you will own him. Tell him he will head his own department and have a secretary. 

 "That sounds easy enough." 

 "I didn't go out of the local area. This is just to impress you. How am I doing so far." 

 "Pretty damn good. Is there any system you can't get into?" 

 "Probably not. I haven't tried any government stuff. Those guys are serious about hackers." 

 "Damn. What color of underwear am I wearing?" 

 "I don't want to know that." 

 The both laugh. 

 "I do have some other stuff that we need to discuss in private." 

 "OK, Amber, will you excuse us." 

 The both watch her ass as she leaves. Fred looks at Eric and smiles. 

 "Prime" 

 "For sure." 

 "OK, what else do you have?" 

 "This is kind of personal, but I want you to hear me out before you get pissed off." 

 "OK, go." 

 "A lot of guys in your position are working too hard and neglecting their wives. I decided to check on your wife." 

 "What the fuck. Is she cheating on me?" 

 "No. She is all yours. However she hired a PI. She is checking up on you. I got into his computer and apparently you are falling off with your home work. She just contacted him two days ago. He hasn't started yet." 

 He watches Fred's face go pale. 

 "Don't panic on me. He is going to wire you house with audio and video and put a GPS on your car. You need to be on your best behavior. Maybe start paying a little more attention to you wife." 

 "Yeah, She's right. I do work too much. She's my high school sweetheart. I don't want to lose her." 

 "Next you need to get rid of that special credit card. It has a lot of suspicious charges on it. Those Tuesday and Thursday charges at the Hilton are a little suspicious. You also need to send Amy on a shopping trip to New York of some where like that. Give her some time off till the PI gives you a clean bill of health. 

 "Jesus fucking christ, Eric. How the fuck do you get all this shit? You're into my bank too?" 

 "It's all out there just floating around. All you have to do is find it." 

 "Fuck. If she finds out about Amy I'm screwed. I don't have a prenup. Amy is the best fuck I ever had. She could fuck me into a coma if she tried." 

 "I'll let you take care of that. I really don't want to know about it, but I thought you should know about the PI." 

 "Fuck. I need to rethink what the fuck I'm doing." 

 "Shall we talk about my salary now?" 

 "Yeah. Let's do that. Name you price. I'm in." 

 "I don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. Let's keep the agreement on my software package. Put me down as a consultant, About $25K per month and the rest can go to my offshore account. I'll expect some nice bonuses when I find some good stuff for you. I'll start getting some information on some out of state competitors." 

 "I like that." 

 "Another thing. You have some deadwood programmers on your payroll. Three of them are pretty good. I know some guys I met in college that I can bring in. The cream of the crop there. There are two good ones I think I can get right away." 

 "OK, run with that and give personnel the names of the deadwood. We should be OK till you bring those guys in." 

 "OK, I'll give you a report every Friday. I can do all of this from home so I won't need an office. 

 Over the next few months Eric expands his information gathering. He goes state by state looking into the systems of the competitors. He feeds the information weekly to Fred. His offshore account is growing in leaps and bounds. The proceeds from the lease of his software package are added to his account too. He is becoming very rich very quickly. 

 ******************* 

 One spring afternoon Eric is sitting in his apartment watching a college baseball game. He hears a stirring noise coming from his bedroom. He smiles as a smallish naked blonde walk out. 

 'Good morning, Tiff. I see you're among the living." 

 'It was close. I feel like a train ran over me. What the fuck did you do to me last night." 

 "Don't you remember. You tried to fuck me to death." 

 "I think my plan backfired. I can hardly walk and my pussy feels like someone ran an eggbeater in it." 

 "There's some Tylenol in the bathroom. Run a tub and soak for a while. It will do wonders. I'll make you some lunch when you're done." 

 "Any bubble bath in there?" 

 "Look under the sink. I think there is some there." 

 "Great. I'll see you in an hour." 

 An hour later she comes out. He gets up and takes her in his arms. 

 "Feeling better now?" 

 "Yep. A good bubble bath makes the world go around." 

 "Come on in the kitchen. You look hungry." 

 'I am. I could eat a horse." 

 "I'm out of horses but I can make some soup and a sandwich. How does that sound." 

 "Prefect, you cook and I'll watch your beautiful ass." 

 "Pervert." 

 Eric is putting together two grilled sandwiches and heating up some vegetable soup. Tiffany is watching his ass. 

 "Tiff. Stop looking at my ass. You know what happens when you do that." 

 "Of course I know. You have the prettiest ass I ever saw. I get wet just looking at it." 

 "Two more weeks and you don't get to look at it any more. Bill won't stand for it." 

 "I know. I have to be a good little wife for a while. I need some time to teach him how to fuck. I hope he's a fast learner." 

 "You haven't fucked him yet?" 

 "No, he still thinks I'm a virgin. I don't think he would marry me if he knew I wasn't.' 

 "Well, you have a blank slate to start out with. Do you think you can pull it off." 

 "Hell yes. He really loves me." 

 "Did he make you sign a prenup yet?" 

 "I don't think he even knows what one is. I don't know if his family will want one or not. I sure as hell won't marry him if they insist." 

 "You told me how much he is getting, but I forgot." 

 "He gets ten million when he turns twenty five." 

 "You're an evil woman, Tiff." 

 "I won't take much. Maybe one or two mil. Enough to take care of myself. He won't miss it. It sure beats working for a living. 

 "Are his parents on to you yet." 

 'No. They think I'm just a sweet little church girl. I go the Sunday School every week with them. They have almost all the wedding planed and I hear Daddy Bill is giving us a honeymoon trip to the Bahamas." 

 "An Academy Award performance every Sunday, huh?" 

 "Those acting lessons I took are paying off." 

 "I should send you to church with a load of my cum in your ass." 

 'Oh my. That sounds exciting. Do you suppose lightening would strike me." 

 The both laugh. 

 They finish lunch and Eric clears the table. He rinses off the dishes off and puts them in the dishwasher. He turns and looks at Tiff. He walks up to her with his dick almost in her face. She leans forward and kisses his cock. She cups his balls and takes it in her mouth. She sucks it up to full hard. He pulls her off his cock, grabs her arm. He pulls her up and bends her over the table. He swipes two fingers over the cube of butter on the table and lubes up her asshole. He rubs some on his cock and lines it up to her little pink pucker.  

 

 

===

"Tell me what you want, Tiff. Tell me." 

 "Fuck me in my ass, Eric. Ram your big cock in me." 

 He pushes and her asshole opens around his cock head. She squeals as it slides past her sphincter. He pushes slowly in. With two inches left he slams all the way in. She howls and cums hard. 

 "Oh fuck. Oh. Oh. Yes. Yes. Fuck my asshole. Fuck me. Fuck me." 

 He reaches around and grabs her nipples. He pulls back just hard enough to cause her a little pain. She cries out and pushes back, meeting each of his thrusts. He keeps pulling and pounding her. She starts cumming and he feels a stirring in his loins. He lets go of her nipples and grabs two hands full of her hair. He pulls back hard and fills her ass with his cum. She cries out and cums with him. He falls on her back, breathing hard. 

 Finally he can stand and he goes in the bathroom and washes up. He comes back and she is still laying on the table. 

 "You OK, Tiff?" 

 She groans, "Fuck no. I can't feel my legs." 

 He helps her up and sits her in a chair. 

 "You bastard. I'm going to need a wheelchair." 

 'Nah, you'll be fine in a few minutes." 

 "Holy shit, Eric. You're such an animal. And what's worse, I can't say no to you. Every time we fuck you almost kill me. That big cock of yours and you know just how to fire my rocket." 

 "I really look forward to our weekends. Lots of good fucking and sucking." 

 'I do too. I'm really going to miss them. I need to take some time off from you. I need to get all my holes back to their virgin state." 

 "Can you go two weeks without fucking?" 

 "Well, I have my power tools. I should be able to last till the honeymoon." 

 "Oh shit. I forgot to tell you. Gary is having a Barbecue this afternoon. You and Bill are invited." 

 "Shit. I had better get going. I need a nap and some time to round up Bill." 

 She rushes off and gets dressed. She puts a pad of toilet paper in her panties to catch Eric's cum. She kisses him goodbye and hobbles out the door. 

 Later that afternoon Eric walks up to Gary's door and punches the doorbell. The door opens and Gary drags him and gives him a big man hug. 

 "Welcome, Bud. It's been a while. Come on in and grab a brew." 

 "What's it been, about a month. How the hell are you doing." 

 "Real good. I got me a main squeeze. She is really hot. I think you know her. Betty Wilson?" 

 "Yeah, I remember her. I met her here last time. How many others are you taking care of." 

 "Just her. She want to be exclusive. I thought I would try it for a while." 

 "Be careful. She may have marriage and babies on her mind." 

 "I dunno. She isn't making those kind of noises yet." 

 They walk through to the pool area. There are already some people there. He knows most of them. Gary introduces him to the ones he doesn't know. He walks around, mingling and sipping his beer. A few minutes later he sees Tiff come in. Bill isn't with her. She sees Eric and hurries up. She gives him a hug and a big kiss. 

 "Where's Bill?" 

 "He'll be here later. He had to do something for his mama." 

 He leans over and whispers, "Do you still have my cum in your ass?" 

 She just smiles and doesn't reply. He knows she does. About an hour later Bill shows up. Tiff grabs him by the arm and introduces him around. He knows a few of the people. Tiff is very careful to hold on to his arm and flash her engagement ring. She fixes him a hamburger and a soda. Eric is chatting with a couple of girls but he is watching Bill. He sees Bill's eyes flitting from girl to girl. He is doing some serious looking at all the tits and ass. Eric also notices he has a good sized boner going. He know Bill will be yanking off tonight. About an hour later they leave. 

 Eric hears the door bell ring. Gary rushes off to answer. He returns with two women in tow. One is a short brunette and the other stuns Eric. She is about 5' 7" tall with skin the color of a mix between milk chocolate and honey. He C cup breasts are pushing out against her t shirt. She is wearing her hair in a short Afro. His mouth drops open as he looks at her eyes. They are as black as night and seem to look into his soul. She makes eye contact with him They hold it for a few seconds. Her lips curl up in a faint smile. He realizes what he is doing and gives her a faint smile. He looks away. A few minutes later he checks out her left hand. He sees a ring but it's not a wedding ring. 

 Gary starts introducing her around. Eric waits for his turn. The approach and Gary says, "Eric, I want you to meet Reina. Reina, meet my best bud, Eric. 

 "Hello, Eric. Nice to meet you." 

 "Hi, Reina. The pleasure is all mine." 

 "Eric, Reina was my Real Estate agent. She handled the sale on this place for me last year. I got a great deal." 

 "Real Estate, huh. Maybe we can do some business. I'm getting a little tired of my apartment. I need something with a little more room." 

 "I don't usually sell while I'm at parties. Why don't you call me and I can show you what's out there." 

 "Sounds good. I'm free Monday. I'll call you." 

 She pulls out a little PDA and looks at it. 

 "I'm free at 10 am. Why don't you come in then." 

 She pulls a card from her purse and hands it to him. 

 He pulls out his phone and makes a note. 

 "What do you do for a living, Eric?" 

 "I'm a computer consultant. I'm working for IT Systems right now." 

 "I've heard of them. Pretty big outfit." 

 'Yeah. They are slowly going nation wide. It's a great place to work." 

 They chat a while longer. He finds out she has an MBA. She likes being out and about selling better than working all day in an office. She is single, 28 years old and has a brother and sister. She was married once for about one year. He is very interested in this one. 

 ************** 

 Monday morning at 10 Eric walks into the Century 21 office building. 

 "Hello, My name is Eric and I have an appointment with Reina." 

 "Just a moment. I'll tell her you're here." 

 She directs Eric into her office. 

 "Good morning, Eric. Please, sit down and let's talk real estate." 

 "Hi, Reina." 

 "I need to get some idea of what you're looking for. I have walk through videos of all our listings." 

 "OK, I need a four bedroom with a den, and a pool. I suspect I can use one of the bedrooms for an office. I do most of my work from home. A barbecue and a hot tub would be nice but I can add that if necessary." 

 "OK, let me do a search and see what I can come up with." 

 He watches her type in the parameters. She watches the screen for a few minutes. 

 "I have about 20 exclusive listings. If you don't like these I can check the multiple listing. I don't have videos of the multiple listings." 

 She turns the monitor so he can see and starts them running. He makes notes of the ones he wants to see. He selects fifteen. He knows he won't like some but he wants to spend more time with her. 

 "Do all of your exclusive listings have all he inspections done?" 

 "Yes. We do that before we take the listing. We do termite, roof, electrical, plumbing, heating and foundation. We can also arrange financing." 

 "When can we do some walk throughs?" 

 "It's almost lunch time. Let's have a bite to eat first. There's an Olive Garden just down the street. Is that OK?" 

 "Sounds good, Let's go. Your car or mine." 

 "Let's take mine. I know where all of these are." 

 They enjoy a nice lunch and start looking. The first two are crap. The spend the rest of the day looking He finds a couple that are a maybe. 

 The spend two more days looking and Eric isn't impressed. She tells him she can set up some appointments for some listed in the multiple listing service if he wants. It will require her calling each one and setting up an appointment with the owners. 

 "There's one I like but it doesn't have a pool. Let's go look at it again." 

 The drive back and walk through again. 

 "This is so close. If it had a pool I would go for it right now. 

 "I have a pocket listing I think you might like. The owners have it priced a little high. We may be able to get them to come down a little." 

 "OK, let look at it. 

 The drive up to it and he is impressed. It has a single and a double garage. There are two hedges on both sides where he suspects the property lines are. They do the walk through. It needs paint inside and new carpet. They go out to the back yard. He sees a nice sized pool, a hot tub and an nice big brick barbecue Other than needing paint and carpeting, it's perfect. 

 "What's the story on this one?" 

 "It's a foreclosure. The bank wants it listed and I'm in the process of getting all the inspections done. It will go on the market in about two weeks." 

 "What's the asking price?" 

 "It's one million two." 

 "Do you think they'll take one million?" 

 "Let me make a call." 

 She walks outside and makes a call. Five minutes later she comes back. 

 "Bottom line is one million one and it's yours." 

 He thinks a minute. 

 "Let's do some paper work." 

 The go back to the office. She types some stuff into the computer and the printer starts up. 

 "How do you want to finance it." 

 "I'll do a wire transfer." 

 Her eyes register a surprise. She gives him the escrow account number. He signs everything and pulls out his phone. He opens an app and makes the transfer. 

 "You can do that on your phone?" 

 "Yeah. I wrote an app so I could. It works with any bank where you have an account." 

 "I keep forgetting you're a computer expert. I shouldn't have been surprised. 

 "Being a geek has it's advantages." 

 "I'll take all this down to the escrow office and get the ball rolling. This should be a quick one. It will probably close in thirty days." 

 "Are we all done here?" 

 "Sort of. There will be some escrow fees when it closes. I'll call you when it closes and we can take care of that." 

 "How about I take you out to dinner to celebrate." 

 "I normally don't date my clients, but I'll make an exception in your case." 

 "Is Friday night good for you?" 

 "That's good. Where are we going?" 

 "How about Romano's down on the gas lamp. It's a pretty nice place. Good food, good music and a dance floor." 

 "I've heard good things about it." 

 "I'll make a reservation and let you know." 

 She hands him a card with her address on it. They shake hands and he leaves. Dinner and dancing always works out well for him. He doesn't feel that she will jump into bed right away. It may take a while. He decides to take it slow. 

 **************** 

 Eric is standing on Reina's front step. He takes a deep breath and rings her bell. A few seconds later the door opens. He sees her standing there and his jaw goes slack. 

 She is wearing a Burgundy silk blouse, a short black mini skirt, black floral patterned hose with three inch black heels. He finally looks up and makes eye contact. She is smiling at him. 

 "Hi Eric. Do you need a towel?" 

 He laughs at himself. 

 "Hi Reina. Sorry about that. I was just dumbstruck by your beauty. This is way different than your work clothes. I must have looked like a teenager on his first date." 

 'It's ok. Come on in. I just need to get my purse and wrap. I'll just be a minute." 

 He walks in and closes the door. He watches her ass cheeks roll as she walks away. His cock stirs. She turns an looks at him and smiles again. He is busted again. 

 He thinks to himself, 'This woman is amazing. She is a consummate professional in business, has a quick wit, a great sense of humor, exudes confidence and is off the scale beautiful. He knows she is the one he wants. 

 She comes back with her purse and a wrap around her shoulders. She steps up to him, gives him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. 

 'Let's go eat. I'm starving." 

 They walk out and she locks the door. She pulls a remote out of her purse and clicks it. She takes his arm and walk to his car. He opens the door for her and she flashes a little leg above her stockings as she gets in. He knows she is playing with him and he likes it. He has the feeling that she likes him as much as he likes her. He is walking on air. 

 He backs out of her driveway and drops it in drive. He punches it and it throws them back in their seats. 

 "Nice toy you have here." 

 "You know, boys and their toys. It's a Camaro ZL1. I'm just getting used to it. I've only had it for about two months." 

 "That's all Greek to me. The only thing I know about cars is you drive them and take them to the dealer for maintenance. If they break down, I call a tow truck. I bought a expensive one to impress my clients." 

 He gives up trying to impress her with his car and they chat on the way. He pulls into the valet parking and gets out. The parking attendant opens her door and helps her out. His eyes feast on her legs as she gets out. He walks around and grins at Eric. 

 "Nice ride, sir." 

 "If you take it for a spin, I'll hunt you down and kill you." 

 The both laugh. 

 She takes his arm as they walk in. Eric slips the host a twenty and his black credit card. He looks at the name on the card and checks against the reservation list. 

 "Run a tab for me, please." 

 "Very good, sir. Right this way, please. Your table is ready." 

 He leads them to the back in a dimly lit corner. He snaps his fingers and a waiter appears. They are both sit. Eric notices the several people are watching them. He smiles with pride, knowing they are looking at his beautiful date. 

 "Eric. What I heard about this place was true. It's really nice. Good choice." 

 "I hoped you would like it. Gary suggested it." 

 "Gary, he's quite a character, isn't he." 

 "Oh, yes. We met in college. He is a dyed in the wool single ladies man. I doubt he will ever get married." 

 "I know. I saw that right away. He tired to make a move on me right off the bat. He's definitely not my type." 

 "He would do that. He knows a beautiful woman when he sees one." 

 "The one he is dating now certainly is. I met her at his barbecue when we met." 

 "What would you like to drink." 

 "I'll let you choose." 

 He looks up and sees the wine steward looking at him. Their eyes meet and he walks up. 

 "Something to drink this evening, Sir." 

 "Yes. A bottle of Dom, please." 

 "Very good, Sir." 

 "OK, Eric. Tell me what you do for your boss." 

 "Ummm, I deal in information. He needs information and I give it to him." 

 "I'm guessing the information is about his competitors. Am I right?" 

 "It's very important to know what your competitors are up to." 

 "So, you hack into their computers and report what you find to your boss." 

 "Hack? That's such a ugly word. Let's just say all their information is just floating around out there and I know how to catch it." 

 "You must be very good at it. You seem to be spoiling you self. Nice car, nice house, nice clothes and a black credit card." 

 "He likes what I get for him very much." 

 "You seem a little mysterious about it. I assume it's all legal." 

 "Oh yes. It's more like a game. I don't do anything but snoop around. He likes to know what they're doing. I don't do any damage to their systems. They try to get our information too. He who gets the best information wins." 

 "You learned this ummm information gathering thing in college?" 

 "Kinda. I met a guy who showed me how. He knew more than the professor. He was just there to get his sheepskin." 

 "Tell me about your goals." 

 "I'm ready to settle down now. I have a good job, a nice house and I can work from home." 

 "That sounds like what everyone wants." 

 "You too?" 

 "Yep. Just looking for Mr. Right like all the women out there. I thought I found him, but it didn't work out that way. He thought he needed more than one woman in his life." 

 "I had one like that in college. She got dropped like a bad habit. I have a problem with people lying to me." 

 "Enough of this depressing topic. Let's enjoy our meal and dance a little." 

 "There ya go. It's probably best to get that stuff out of the way and move on to the good stuff." 

 They finish their meal and get a table near the dance floor. The band is warmed up and ready to go. 

 The dance for a couple of hours and decide to call it a night. Eric adds $100 to the tab an signs it. 

 "Spread that around please. The service and food was very good." 

 "Thanks you, Sir. Come back anytime. We're glad to be of service. 

 The drive to her house was relatively quiet. It seemed that we both were lost in thought. I knew I was. I knew I was developing some strong feelings for her and I knew she was the one for me. I just wasn't sure how deep they were. It's like it was all new to me. In the past I had feelings for different women, but nothing like this. I couldn't admit I was in love. Not just yet, and I had no idea what she was feeling. She seemed very comfortable with me and seemed to enjoy my company. I decided not to push anything with her. It was still too early in our relationship. I planned on just letting it develop. 

 We got to her house and I walked her to her door. She turned and I took her in my arms. She looked up at me and smiled. I felt like a teenager on his first date. I decided to throw caution to the wind and I leaned down and kissed. He soft lips met mine. She gasped a little and met my kiss. My tongue slid across her lips and they opened. My tongue found hers. Her firm body pushed against me. It was my turn to gasp. We held the kiss what seemed like hours and then she pulled back a little. 

 "Thank you for a wonderful evening, Eric. You're nice to be with." 

 "Thank you. I had a great time. You're not only great company, but an great dancer too." 

 "Will you call me during the week. We can go to lunch." 

 "I promise. I want to see you again." 

 She gave me a quick peck on the lips. The turned, clicked her remote and unlocked her door. 

 "Goodnight, Eric. Call me." 

 "Goodnight. I will." 

 I floated back to by car and watched till she closed the door. I cranked up my baby and sped away. 

 It was about eleven o'clock. I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep so I decided to take a drive. I headed east on Interstate 8. After I cleared El Cajon I opened it a little. I ran it up to eighty five and let her run. I held it there till I passed the Viejas Casino. I ran it up to one hundred. It held the road like it was on rails. I cleared Pine Valley and came to a long straight section. I punched it and ran it up to one forty. It still held the road. Part of my mind was on Reina and part was on the thrill of the speed. The end of the straightaway game up fast and I let off till I was back to one hundred. I held it there till I got to the Golden Acorn exit. I pulled into their parking lot and shut it down. I sat thinking. 

 I slowly came to the realization that I was indeed in love. She had completely captivated me. I wanted her with me all the time. I felt like a great weight had been lifted off my shoulders. This was new territory for me and it felt good once I admitted it to my self. With a big grin on my face I headed back down the mountain. 

 "I blew by the bug station at about ninety. I saw the flash of a white door. I backed out of it to about seventy five. His lights came on and he quickly pulled behind me. He turned on his overheads and then turned them off. I pulled to the side and got my paperwork out for him. He walked up and tapped the window. I lowered it and said, "Good evening, officer." 

 "Hello. I need to see your license, registration and insurance papers." 

 I handed them to him. He went back to his car and ran my name in his computer. He came back and gave me my papers. 

 "Nice ride you have here. What's under the hood?" 

 'Ummm, I'm not sure. Just a lot of power. It's a supercharged V8. The book says almost 600 horsepower." 

 "Have you let out yet?" 

 "Just a little. I haven't had it long. It may be too much for me." 

 "OK, I'm not going to cite you. Just take it easy. I don't want to have to pick up your pieces somewhere down the hill." 

 "Thanks officer. I'll behave."  

 

 

===

I pulled away and set it on eighty and tapped the cruise control button. He didn't follow me. I think he just wanted to look over my ride. 

 I got home, slipped into bed and slept like a baby. 

 Saturday morning I woke up to my phone ringing. Gary and his buddy Leon wanted to come over and watch some college ball on my new setup. I told him to bring some snacks and beer. Nothing is free. He showed up in time for the ten am game. 

 "Hey, bud. Come on it. Hey, Leon. Make yourselves at home. It's almost game time." 

 We got all set up and watched the first half. Gary started grilling me about Reina. 

 "So, buddy. How goes it with Reina. You in love yet." 

 "Jeez, guy. I just met her. We've only gone out a couple of times. You know, lunch and dinner." 

 "Admit it. You're in love. You can't resist her." 

 "I know. She is some amazing woman." 

 The both teased me til the second half started. 

 Between games I stepped out and called Reina. 

 "Hi, Eric. What are you up to today?" 

 "Not much. Gary and Leon came over. Guy stuff and sports and beer. The wanted to see my new TV." 

 "A little male bonding, huh?" 

 "Yeah. You busy today?" 

 "Yes. I have to show a house in Pacific Beach this afternoon. It's a second showing so I think they're ready to make an offer. I'll reel them in." 

 "You're good at reeling them in." 

 "Oh, really." 

 "I know first hand." 

 We both chuckled. 

 "I just called to hear your voice and tell you I had a great time last night." 

 "That's sweet of you to say that. Thank you." 

 "How about I call you Tuesday for lunch. I need to do some work for John on Monday. He'll want something at the end of the week." 

 "That's fine. I'll make sure I don't have anything scheduled." 

 "Bye bye." 

 "Goodbye. Eric." 

 Gary and Leon hung around all day in front of my TV. They wanted to come back tomorrow. We ended up watching sports for the rest of the weekend. 

 Monday I found some interesting stuff for John. I was working my way up into Northern California. I put it all in a thumb drive for him. 

 Tuesday, I took Reina to lunch at the Olive Garden again. She seemed happy to see me. I know I was happy to see her. We had a nice lunch and I set up another date for Friday night. 

 And, Yes, she got an offer accepted on the house in Pacific Beach. She would be getting two percent on a $500K sale. 

 Friday night we dined, wined and danced at a nice hotel. When I took her home we had a hot session of kissing and hugging on her steps. She was taking my tongue down her throat and pressing against my boner. We both got pretty hot. I thought for a few minutes she was going to invite me, but we parted hot and horny. 

 I took her to lunch on Wednesday at the Olive Garden again and set up a date for Saturday night at Romano's. Gary, Leon and their dates wanted to meet up with us. She agreed and I made reservations for six. 

 *************** 

 We arrived a little early and secured out table. Fifteen minutes later Gary, Leon and their dates showed up. Introductions were made all around and we settled down with three carafes of wine. We had a great time and a great meal. We moved to a table near the dance floor and the dancing began. The first one was a slow one and Reina and I moved out on the floor. With her lithe, soft body plastered to mine we floated around the floor. I was in heaven and by all appearances she was too. She snuggled up close and laid her head on my chest. Her firm breasts pressed against my chest and my semi hard cock pressed against her stomach. The third slow one started and I leaned down and kissed her. She returned it by sliding her tongue into my mouth. I moaned and pulled her closer." 

 The song ended and we walked back to the table. Gary was watching us. I saw his eyes look at the bulge in my pants. He smiled and as we sat he said, "You two should get a room." Everyone laughed and Reina looked into my eyes, leaned toward me and kissed me. I knew we were on our way. 

 We stayed a while longer, trading partners for the fast dances. A slow set started and Reina took my hand and led me out to the dance floor. She moved into my arms and pressed against me. I leaned down and kissed her again. I broke the kiss and whispered in her ear, "I love you, Reina." she gasped and looked into my eyes as if looking to see if I really meant it. She smiled and mouthed the magic words, "I love you too. 

 We danced to two more slow songs. As I held her tight she looked up at me. 

 "Take me home, baby." 

 I didn't say a word. We both knew tonight was the night. The song ended and we walked back to the table. I looked at Gary and said, "We're going to get a room. See you guys later." With that, Reina picked up her purse and wrap and we walked out. 

 Not that I was in a hurry, but I broke most of the speed limits on the way to my house. Reina sat quietly with her hand on my thigh. 

 We walked in the door and immediately started kissing and removing clothes. We left a trail of clothes leading into the bedroom. I was holding her soft naked body to mine. I stepped back. 

 "I been waiting for this for quite a while. I want to look at you. Show me that beautiful body. She smiled and struck a pose for me. One toe pointed and her knee in front of her other leg. One hand on her hip and one behind her head. I stood in awe looking at her perfect body. He dark nipples were at attention and her shaved mound greeted my eyes. 

 "Amazing. Just amazing. The most beautiful woman I've ever seen." 

 'Thank you, baby. I want to be pretty for you." 

 She moved to me and our bodies pressed together. My throbbing hard cock against her stomach. He firm breasts on my chest. I lifted her and laid her on the bed. I gently laid on her and kissed her around her neck. She moaned and I knew I found a hot spot. I licked and sucked all around her neck and ears. I worked my way down to her firm breasts. I gently massaged them while suck on her nipples. Her moans and groans spurred me on. My hand slid down over her stomach to her shaved mound. He legs parted and I found her moist pussy lips. She opened her legs more for me. I gently caressed her pussy lips. I was in no hurry and I sensed she wasn't either. We both knew we had all night. 

 I kissed my way down to her mound. She spread her legs so I get between them. I sat up on my knees feasting my eyes on her beauty. Our eyes met and she whispered. 

 "Love on me baby. It's been so long. Love on me." 

 "I slid my hands down the inside of her thighs. She lifted her legs and spread wide for me, giving herself to me. I settled down to some serious pussy eating. I licked and sucked on her dark flower, watching her labia fill with blood and open for me. He clit peeked at me from under its hood. I licked from her dark pucker up over her blood engorged pussy lips to her clit. She cried out and thrust her hips up. He juices started flowing for me. I licked up her ambrosia as fast is I could. He hands were in my hair, holding me in place. Little animal noises filled my ears. I stuck one finger in her and gently started finger fucking her. He thrusts met mine as I licked around her pussy lips. I stuck in another finger. I heard her gasp as it pushed in her. More of her juices flowed out and down over her dark pucker. My fingers curled up and found her G spot. She moaned and pulled her legs up to her breasts. I worked on her G spot for a few minutes. He humping gained intensity. I sensed she was about to cum. I rubbed her G spot faster and sucked up her clit. He body went rigid as her orgasm hit her. 

 "Yes. Yes. Oh god yes." 

 As her orgasm peaked I sucked her clit up again. Another one hit her and she cried out for me. I waited for her to come down and moved up over her. My cock head touched her pussy lips. Her hands found it and rubbed it around in her moisture. 

 "Fuck me, baby. Fuck me with that big cock. Make me your woman." 

 He heels hooded in my ass cheeks and her hips thrust up. My cock popped in stretching her lips around it. She cried out and came again. 

 "All of it, baby. I want all of it. Fuck me. fuck me." 

 I lowered myself, pressing into her hot wet pussy. Slowly she took all of me in her. Her legs locked behind me holding me in. I could feel her cervix touching my cock. My pelvis bone met hers and she rubbed her clit on it. I felt her pussy grasp my cock and another orgasm rocked her body. 

 "Oh god Yes. Cumming on your cock. Fucking god yes." 

 He pussy muscles were strong and I knew I wouldn't last long. He arms went around my chest and she moaned into my ear. 

 "Cum in me, baby. Fill my pussy with your cum" 

 We picked up a rhythm, thrusting and grinding. I felt the stirring in my loins. 

 "Take it baby. Take my cum." 

 She pushed up and gripped my cock. I felt my cock swell and pushed hard into her. She gave me one hard squeeze and my cum rocketed into her hot grasping pussy. Mutual orgasms flooded our senses as my cum filled her. Our screams filled the room. 

 "Our convolutions finally stopped and I collapsed on her. She held me, locked in her embrace, kissing my neck and chest. I must have been squishing her because she rolled me off, still holding me with her legs and arms. 

 "Hold me, baby. Hold me." 

 I pulled her closer and held her against me, one hand on her back and one on her firm ass. 

 "Eric, I love you. I'm your woman now, forever." 

 "Forever, baby. Forever." 

 Finally, she released me from her grip and pushed me on my back. She laid her head on my chest and slid her hand down to my limp cock. She coated her hand in our love juice and took her finger in her mouth. She licked it clean. She moved her hand up to my mouth. 

 "Taste us." 

 She stuck a finger in my mouth. I sucked and licked it clean. 

 "Good, huh?" 

 "Yep, pretty good." 

 The taste surprised me. Just slightly salty. I knew then that I would be eating many our our cream pies. 

 After a few minutes I heard her whisper. 

 "I want you again, baby. I want more." 

 I didn't protest. She moved down and started licking and sucking my cock. He nails gently raked under my balls. In just a few minutes my cock filled with blood. She moved up over me and held my cock head against her pussy lips. She rubbed it in our juices and then slowly took it. I moaned and she slid down on me. My cock bottomed out and I heard her moan. 

 "Yes. Full of my lovers cock. Yes. Yes." 

 She put her hands on my chest and started. He pussy muscles did things to my cock that I didn't think were humanly possible. I reached up and held her breasts, tweaking and rolling her dark nipples. She pulled almost all the way out and dropped on me. He clit hit my bone and an orgasm rocked her. He head fell back and her mouth was open. She kept repeating this. As she would slide down she would clamp down hard on me. After a few of these I felt the stirring in my loins. She seemed to sense it too and she sped up. 

 "Now, baby. Now." 

 She pulled up, clamped down on my cock and dropped. That pushed me over the edge. My cock swelled and started pumping cum in her. She squealed and came with me. Her head was back, her mouth open and her eyes closed as she milked my cum into her grasping pussy. We sang a melody of mutual ecstasy with our moans and groans. Finally she collapsed on my chest, her pussy milking the last drops of my cum into her. My arms went around her and I held her tight. 

 Our breathing returned to normal. I raised up and pulled the blankets up over us. We fell asleep in a loving embrace. 

 I woke first the next morning. I raised myself on my elbow and just looked. Feelings of love and joy almost overwhelmed me. I shook myself back to reality and headed to the shower. After a quick shave, shower and attention to my morning breath I walked back into the bedroom. She was sitting up, stretching and yawning. 

 "Naked breakfast in fifteen minutes." 

 "Oh yeah. Perfect. Your woman is starving." 

 "Your man is too." 

 I smiled, turned and headed to the kitchen. 

 She walked into the kitchen just as I finished putting all the food on the table. She was drying her hair with a big fluffy towel. I stopped and just looked, watching her breasts sway. She smiled. 

 "See something you like?" 

 "No. I see something I love. I'll never get tired of looking at you, so get used to it." 

 "It's a two way street. I love looking at you too. You're my hunk." 

 "OK, enough of this. Sit down and dig in." 

 I poured her a cup of coffee and we both loaded our plates. 

 "I could get used to having my man cook for me. This is nice." 

 "This is about the best I do unless you like mac and cheese, Campbell's soup or Top Ramen." 

 "Ah yes. Good old college food. It's been a long time since I ate that low on the food chain." 

 "Me too. I don't want to go back." 

 We finished eating and I poured us each a cup of coffee. 

 I asked her, "How you feeling now.' 

 "I feel stuffed, happy and loved. How about you?" 

 "Pretty much the same. It's all good. 

 We lounged around the rest of the day, fucking every time I got an erection. We tried to fuck each other to death. She almost succeeded. 

 **************** 

 One week later we did our "meet the parents" thing. I was pleasantly surprised that her parents accepted the fact that I was white and dating their daughter. He brother was there and I passed his inspection too. Her sister was away somewhere and couldn't make it. 

 He mother was an older version of her. I told her Dad he was a lucky man. He smiled and agreed. The seem to be very much in love even after all the years they had been married. He was a retired machinist. She was a retired teacher. They lived quite comfortably on their pensions. I suspected Reina gave them the house. It was a beautiful three bedroom in La Mesa. 

 My parents had been forewarned and took to her immediately. Mom spirited her away into the kitchen to make dinner. Dan gave me a big high five with a shit eating grin on his face. I mentioned that he was a dirty old man and he didn't argue. I knew he could read my feelings for her all over my face. We chatted a while, had a nice dinner and finally left. We spent the night at her house. 

 *************** 

 Over the next few months Reina and I spent as much time together as possible. We went to concerts, plays, movies, and dining and dancing. One night she took me to a country and western dance hall. I learned to do the Texas two step and the Lindy. Every night we spent together fucking our brains out. I was amazed at how versatile she was in and out of bed. 

 We quickly grew tired of having to spend even a few nights apart. It was when I finally got around to getting the inside of my place painted. I stayed at her place while the painters went to work. We talked about it and decided that she would move in with me. Her brother was renting an apartment and she gave up her place to him. We moved her stuff to my place and got settled in. It was truly wonderful waking up with her in my bed every morning. I was one happy camper. 

 Three months later John and I had sent out the next build for my software package. One company in Poway was having trouble with it. It was on a Friday and I was pouring over the build, and trying to find out why they were having trouble. I came home with a briefcase full of paperwork. 

 I walked in and found Reina, naked in the kitchen. I had to stop and feast my eyes. She just smiled and went on with what she was doing. Finally I came to and greeted her with a grope and a kiss on her hot spot. She shivered and hugged me. 

 "I have a little work to do, baby. One customer is giving me fits over my program." 

 "Go ahead. Dinner will be ready in about an hour." 

 I sat on the sofa and pulled out my paperwork. I was concentrating on it as I walked into my office. 

 "Honey. Will you help me with this. I can't get it to save my work." 

 I walked over, still looking over my papers. I leaned over and held one breast and kissed her on the neck. I saw the save icon was gray. 

 "It looks like you already saved it." 

 I saw some movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked and saw Reina standing in the doorway. 

 "What the...huh? What. Oh fuck." 

 She walked over to me and hugged me. 

 "Honey, You've already met my twin sister, Keesha. We're a package deal." Report_Story
