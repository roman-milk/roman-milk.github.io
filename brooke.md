Brooke

"Hi! Carlene!" Brooke waved across the crowded mall at her friend. It was Saturday morning and Brooke had a lot to do in preparation for college on Monday. First she wanted a pair of sunglasses to go with the Honda she was picking up from the dealership this afternoon. 

She watched her long time friend stride toward her. Except that they were both nineteen and had shared a friendship for many years they were very different. The crowd parted for her without thought, which people just didn't do for Brooke. It was Carlene's dominant attitude and Brooke's submissive nature that made the difference. 

Brooke was a tall, beautiful large busted black girl with a gentle smile and irresistible lips. Carlene was petite, white and lesbian. They had both played together with toys that almost broke each other's virginity, taking it in turns at pretending to be the boyfriend. 

Eventually Carlene decided she preferred girls but the only thing that changed was that she always got to be the boyfriend instead of taking turns. From then on Brooke learnt to submit to her friend when they played their private sex games. It was a joke between them that Brooke had turned her high school friend into a total lesbian. 

"Hi! I thought you would be picking up your car. What are you up to?" Carlene asked. She eyed Brooke's light summer dress and noted she wasn't wearing underwear and knew she was out to play rather than shop. 

Brooke caught her staring and giggled. "I'm picking it up this afternoon but I'm so excited I just couldn't sit at home waiting. I saw some sunglasses in there I just need to buy. They will look so cool in the car, what do you think?" she said, twirling her long curly hair at the window display. 

They sauntered in to the store finding a lone white salesman. He was about thirty and looked married and unhappy. Just the way they liked them. The game was on, flirting to get an impressive discount; the poor guy didn't stand a chance. 

The guy couldn't take his eyes off Brooke, trying hard not to be noticed, as he manoeuvred to get a good look through the thin dress. 

"I'll leave this one to you, it shouldn't take you long. I'll see you in the coffee shop." Carlene told her. With a wink she turned and strode out. 

"Hello there. Can I help you?" He asked with a smile. He looked more relaxed now Carlene had disappeared. 

"Sure. I want to see those glasses from the window display. Yea, that's the ones." 

He slipped them on balancing them on the end of her cute nose. She pushed them into place with a long pained fingernail and looked from side to side in a mirror studying each angle. 

"Are you sure you don't want to see some others?" He asked. 

"I always know what I want." She told him with a shy smile. "What kind of discount would you give me on these, for cash?" She asked. 

"They're top of the range. I could manage ten percent. Just for you." He said giving her a meaningful look. 

"I need more than that. I need all the money I've got to start college on Monday." She said. 

"We could make a deal I guess. Here, let's look at what stock there is in back. I have just the thing you're looking for." 

Brooke thought about what he might be up to while following him into the storeroom. She wasn't stupid but after a little grappling she would have something over him and maybe the discount would bring them down to her price range. 

"What about a hundred percent discount? You do me a favour and I do you one. OK?" He told her. 

She stood there unsure of herself. Where did this machismo suddenly come from? He looked a push over out there and now he had an arm round her holding on tight. She tried to pull away but he was too strong. 

"Hey, let go. I only wanted a discount nothing more from you." She complained. 

"Wearing a dress like that, what do you expect?" He said. 

"My washing machine broke down. Can you see through this? I didn't think anyone could!" She tried telling him but he wasn't buying it. 

His hand slipped around and pulled up the back of the dress. She felt his hand slide between her butt cheeks and she opened her mouth to yell. Before a sound emerged his mouth clamped on hers and a tongue began to explore her mouth. His technique was good, especially what he was doing to her arse, but she didn't want him, just the discount. 

She felt this finger press against her arse hole then circle it, just teasing away at her. He had her pressed hard against his pants where she could feel the bulge of his cock. He was ready but she wasn't, not here, not now. 

He lifted her off her feet then lowered her quickly to the floor where she fell on her knees. He had squeezed the breath out of her and she kneeled at his feet gasping for air. With her mouth open he thrust his cock in without thought to whether she wanted him or not. 

The sounds of protest escaped around his cock as nothing more than muffled yelps. 

"That's it you tease, swallow it all." He told her. 

He held her head still with a firm grip in her long hair while his hips thrust back and forth in a long slow rhythm. He jerked to a halt with a small backward movement and his legs quivered. He almost collapsed as he came, spurting his cum into her mouth. 

Disgusted at the thought of swallowing this stranger's cum she looked around for somewhere to spit but just as she made up her mind to spit it down his trousers he grabbed her chin. 

"Let's see it." He said, squeezing her cheeks in his small smooth hands. 

The touch of his hand alone was enough to make her skin creep. Opening her mouth wide he could see pearls of cum on her tongue where it was starting to dribble down her throat. She couldn't spit with is hand squeezing her jaw and was sickened to feel it sliding down her throat. 'Damn him.' She thought. 

"Well that's worth a discount alright." He leered. 

Was it worse that she had submitted to him so easily or that he was paying her for it; she couldn't work it out but either way she felt used and ashamed. To add to the humiliation she was wet between the legs. His use of her body, like some whore, had made her hot and there was little chance of him satisfying that feeling now. 

Not that she wanted it to be him in any case. What was so annoying was that she knew from experience the feeling was going to grow all day. It would nag at her not letting her forget what he had done to her until she too received satisfaction. 

He was making meaningless conversation as though nothing had happened and all she could do was glower at him. What could she say? Grabbing the sunglasses she huffed at him when he offered to wrap them and stormed out of the store. 

Keeping to the shaded side of the mall Brooke made her way to the coffee shop. Brooke found her friend and plonked her body down upon a hard chair. She proffered a large smile wiggling the glasses with her nose. 

"So you got them then. How much discount did you get? You were a long time. You must have haggled well girl." Carlene said suspiciously. 

"Fifty-percent." Brooke said flatly. It was a lie but how could she tell her friend what had happened. 

"You can afford to pay for coffee then. Here, don't budge I'll get them; you can wait all day if you don't serve yourself." Carlene complained with a glance at the waitress. "Just sit there and look pretty." 

Carlene sauntered back with two cups. She placed hers down first then bent over Brooke and kissed her. 

Brooke's eyes widened with embarrassment. Not from a kiss in public for they liked to shock people, but from what it revealed. She took a quick swig of coffee and swirled it around her mouth. Then swallowed quickly, grimacing. 

"It's too late to swill away the evidence girl. I know what you did. You gave that old guy a blowjob. I hope you got more than fifty-percent off. You're becoming one hell of a slut Brooke. You should watch out." Her friend said then clicked her tongue at her in disapproval. 

"It was one hundred percent. I didn't volunteer he just grabbed me and helped himself." Brooke spat the words out in disgust. She grimaced and downed the coffee in one gulp. "So now we've both tasted his cum." She said with a scowl. It was some small satisfaction seeing Carlene grimace at the idea of tasting a stranger cum from her friend's mouth. 

Carlene looked at her friend with a grimace. "I told you before; you've just got to watch out for yourself. It's a nasty habit you have Brooke. You like to flirt and being submissive means you give in way too easily. No wonder you get into trouble. Anyway I've stuff to do. Swing by my place for lunch and I'll give you a lift to pick up your car." 

Brooke poked out her tongue with a scowl and they both laughed. "Bye. See you later." Brooked smiled. She didn't feel happy though, for Mister Store Guy had left her feeling used. She didn't even know his name. This wasn't the first time she had got into trouble like this though performing for a pair of glasses was a pretty gross thing to do. What was worse she was feeling hot too. Still, there was a party tonight so maybe she would meet someone nice and get lucky.

"Hi! Mrs Wymore. Carlene said to come over for lunch, is that OK?" Brooke asked. 

"Yea, sure honey, come on in. The foods nearly ready but Carlene isn't back yet. You can help in the kitchen." Carlene's mother told her. 

Brooke looked at Mrs Wymore's breasts and wondered if she could press her luck. In high school she had taken a Health class and one of her assignments had been to give a breast examination to a close friend or member of the family. 

The leaflets from school gave a serious message about regular breast examinations and the thought of breast cancer had seriously worried Mrs Wymore. At first she had reluctantly agreed to help Brooke with the assignment but after the first exam overcame her embarrassment. 

Over the last few months Brooke had convinced her to have regular re- examinations so now she had free access to those lovely tits whenever she liked. 

Brooke had chopped and diced the salad and the rice and peas was on so all they had to do was wait for Carlene to arrive. 

"So, Mrs Wymore I start college Monday. I guess I won't have much spare time with all that studying. I think I should give you another exam as we've got time and there's no one around." Brooke said casually. 

She still felt hot and the prospect of fondling those large breasts gave her an extra surge, which she tried not to show. 

"Are you sure Brooke? I mean it's only been a couple of weeks, surely nothing could have developed since then." She asked, showing some concern. 

"Well you know it's safer just to check." Brooke told her, mirroring the concern on her friend's mom's face. 

She followed Mrs Wymore into the bedroom where she removed her blouse. Brooke watched her slip both arms through the straps to pull the catch around in front. Unhooking it with a deft flick of her fingers it was off, to be discarded on the bed. She sat down on the edge of it ready for Brooke. 

Brooke kneeled between her legs and moved in. "Put your arms up Mrs Wymore as I showed you." The woman lifted both arms wrapping them around the back of her neck lifting the large orbs. Brooke took one in both hands and massaged it, lifting it up and around. 

With fingertips she pushed at the soft flesh as though looking for a lump moving over every inch of the breast. Pinching a nipple between a finger and thumb she lifted the whole breast away from her chest stretching it upward. 

"Does that hurt Mrs Wymore?" She asked kindly. 

"Just a little." She whispered. 

Brooke felt the nipple swell between her fingers wondering how it would be if her friend caught her here. Carlene would know exactly what she was doing to her mom. She was teasing her breasts not examining them. It wasn't a woman's breasts that Brooke found so fascinating it was the illicitness of the game; it was her friend's mom she was playing with. That she was enjoying it too was obvious but Mrs Wymore pretended not to. 

Resting them for a moment she asked. "I couldn't feel any lumps. Did that feel all right Mrs Wymore? Nothing hurt except the nipples?" Brooke asked. 

"No that was fine. You're doing a good job. Thanks." She replied in a breathy whisper. 

Carried away in a moment of exuberance Brooke leant forward and sucked on a nipple. "What are you doing Brooke?" She asked in astonishment. 

"Oh! Sorry Mrs Wymore. Just checking that's all. The nipple seemed a little different that's all. Lips are more sensitive than fingers." She blustered trying to excuse herself. Unable to look at the woman in case her flaming face gave her away she quickly took the other breast in both hands. 

Again she kneaded it and pushed her fingertips into the soft warm flesh. "There might be something there, can you feel anything? It doesn't hurt does it?" She asked. 

"No dear. Keep digging just in case." She said. 

With her fingertips she delved into every soft niche of the large breast. Seeming to be satisfied she said. "No there's nothing there. I had better test the nipple." 

Pinching it between a finger and thumb she pulled the breast up almost under her chin. It too swelled up and Brooke marvelled at its size even though she had seen it happen before. The nipples were so small until she did this, then they swelled up enormously. 

"I'll do the same as before if that's OK?" She said trying to keep the smile from her voice. 

Mrs Wymore nodded not even daring to whisper now as her breathing had become deep and ragged. 

Brooke could smell her muskiness or was it her own excitement? She leant forward and sucked the huge nipple into her mouth. This time she bit on it eliciting a groan from her friend's mom. 

Brooke didn't want to let go but instead took both breasts in her hands weighing them. "They seem the same size Mrs Wymore so I guess that's OK." She told her. 

The image of letting the woman loll back on the bed was strong in Brooks' imagination. Squatting between her legs it would be easy to lean forward into her crotch. She was sure now she could smell her friend's mother's muskiness and wanted to taste it too. 

All Brooke had to do was pull the panties to one side and suck. That's all it would take and the woman would be hers. She knew what to do and did it well, as her daughter had told her often enough. 

The lust was strong in Brooke's head and she very nearly spoilt the whole charade only there was a shout from the back door. "Anyone in?" Carlene called. 

Carlene's mom quickly pulled her bra and top on then scrambled back to the kitchen. Brooke sidled into Carlene's bedroom to where she knew there was a vibrator in a bedside draw. She quickly went to the bathroom and locked the door hoping for some peace and quiet to concentrate on fulfilling the build up of excitement. 

The memory of that awful salesman's cock in her mouth was too real and the only way to rid the memory was to cum. The frustration had been building all day from when she first woke up and decided to wear the sundress without underwear. 

She imagined the cock belonged to Danny, a biker friend, and added that to the feel of her friend's mom's breasts in her hands. Sitting on the toilet seat she opened her legs to find how wet and ready she was. A finger found her clit and she enjoyed the tingle against her swollen lips using just the tip of the vibrator. 

Ready to thrust it in she felt the battery dieing and cursed. "Damn Carlene, how come I always have to buy the batteries?" Sliding it in between her wet lips she knew it would leave her feeling even more frustrated yet just had to feel something hard inside. 

"You ready for lunch Brooke." Carlene said while banging on the door. "We've got to hurry if you're going to pick up the Honda." 

"Damn!" She wailed with a sigh of frustration. 

"OK! I'll be right out." Brooke shouted back. 

Mrs Wymore gave her a funny look as she sat at the kitchen table. Brooke knew her friend's mom had enjoyed it although not as much as she had. She kept glancing at Brooke and looking away. Her nipples still stood out through the blouse. Brooke smiled at herself knowing the woman had been excited and was still hot. 

Maybe the pretence of an examination was wearing too thin to continue. Next time it could go either way; she might continue with the teasing, refuse to play, or make a fuss. Not knowing was part of the excitement for Brooke. 

*** 

Outside the Honda dealership Carlene smiled at Brooke. "I thought you would have put on some underwear by now." She said and pinched a nipple. 

"Hey! That hurt." She complained. 

"That's the way you like it girl. I know you too well." She laughed. "You know where the party is tonight? Good. I'll see you there." 

Brooke watched her friend gun the car down the road with a skit into the traffic, pissing some guy off, and grinned. This was a great day. She felt so excited about picking up this great car and on top of that she felt so damn horny. Thinking about the car was probably what set her off this morning, not that she ever needed an excuse. 

The paperwork had been prepared so all she had to do was collect the car but she had to see Marcia for the keys. Across the show room she could see the attractive woman chatting up some guy, a prospective customer. Impatiently she waited for them to finish. 

Marcia was a cute Latin beauty with large flashing eyes and long auburn hair. Brooke watched her walk toward her flashing a wide saleswoman smile and dangling a set of keys in her left hand. 

"So the big day has arrived Brooke." She smiled. "I need to drive you to the gas station down the road and fill her up. You need to feel full don't you?" She teased. 

Brooke was caught off guard, had she been reading her mind, then quickly replaced the thought with the exciting idea of driving the Honda. 

"Here, jump in, you can drive." She told Brooke. 

Brooke glanced at the stick and noticed Marcia's long legs. She hadn't bothered to pull down her skirt and was sitting with her legs slightly open. Brooke didn't need a distraction she wanted to fill up with gas and hit the road. 

"Those are nice tits girl. You should have them pierced. If you are going to show them off then do it properly." 

Brooke was surprised although she shouldn't have been for Marcia had teased her before only she had assumed it was just a part of the sales pitch. 

"Yea. Maybe some time. I'll think about it." She replied. 

"I can get you a discount at Joe's parlour." 

Thankfully they pulled in and Brooke got out to fill up while Marcia went to pay. The sun was low and it shone through the little sundress as though she were wearing a diaphanous wrap. When Brooke turned she caught Marcia eyeing her up and blushed. 

'Hell! I'm feeling horny enough I don't need this.' She thought. Looking across the oily concrete she caught sight of a bunch of guys eyeing her up. They were making comments about her breasts swinging. From where they were the sun shone straight through the dress leaving her practically naked. 

"So many men, so few seconds in a life time." She mused quietly. 

Instead of driving back to the showroom Marcia guided her with a hand to her knee up a block in the other direction. Disoriented in the unfamiliar neighbourhood Brooke hadn't noticed until they arrived and parked up. Taking her hand Marcia guided her into the store. 

"I'll have a look but I don't think I will to today. It looks painful." She grimaced. 

"Come on girl, be brave, it won't hurt at all. It's on me as a treat for buying the car." Marcia said. With a hand on her back Marcia guided her to what looked like a barber's chair where she plonked herself down. She began to think of it as a dentist chair and cringed. 

"I've thought about it but don't really want them pierced. I guess I could take a look at some rings or whatever." Brooke said.  

===

Marcia helped herself to a tray and handed it to the prey. Just sit there and see what you like the look of. I'll find out how much it costs." Marcia told her. 

Marcia dragged Joe over where he went over the different styles with Marcia butting in with suggestions. Without realising Brooke had agreed with a choice of two that looked small and the least intrusive. She hadn't agreed to have them pierced, or so she thought. 

"Here let me see if those are suitable." Joe told her. 

Before Brooke realised what he meant Marcia pulled the top of her dress down leaving her breasts on show. She looked away from the guy in embarrassment wanting to cover up in front of a stranger examining her nipples. 

He looked at them with professional interest seemingly disinterested in her breasts. 'Well I guess he's seen so many it doesn't bother him.' She thought. 'But it bothers me, a stranger staring at my nipples.' She wanted to cover them with her hands but just sat there with the two of them commenting on her assets. 

Brooke was startled when Marcia pinched a nipple. She looked from one to the other of them wondering when she was going to get from there. All she wanted was to get out on the road and drive her new Honda. 'Damn. Leave me alone.' She thought. 

Marcia distracted her and Joe moved in with what looked like a staple gun. "Ouch!" Brooke shouted with a startled look on her face. She closed her eyes with the shock of the sudden little pain. Trying to cover up with her hands she found they were strapped to the chair. 'Hey! Let me go.' She complained. 

"You need to keep still for Joe sweetie." Marcia told her, with wicked grin lighting her face. 

"Shit!" Brooke exclaimed. The sting was less in her left nipple or she had become used to it. Fortunately the pain was short lived until the nipples merely throbbed as though Carlene had pinched them while playing too rough a game. 

Wanting to escape her torturers Brooke made to get up only her wrists and knees had been strapped to the chair. In dismay Brooke watched Joe push a button for the chair to open up as though it were splitting apart and in the process her legs were separating. 

It was no good she couldn't pull them together the straps were too tight. She grunted with the effort then looked at Joe wondering what was next. Her mind was in a whirl when Marcia lifted the hem of the dress. These strangers were looking intently at her pussy. She wanted to protest but the words just wouldn't form she was that much in a panic. 

Taking a deep breath she tried to calm herself enough to clear her thoughts. Before she could speak Marcia leaned over and kissed her. With a hand gently cupping her right breast Marcia massaged it attempting to relieve the throbbing. Or so she said. 

Brooke could feel her body responding yet again from all the stimulation she had received that day it was a wonder she didn't just orgasm right there in the store. 

With a tongue deeply exploring her mouth all Brooke managed was a whimper. Her lips had been pierced! It was more painful than having a nipple pierced and she could feel them swelling in reaction. They had already been excited and open now they were bulging like a pouting mouth. 

Coming up for air Brooke looked down at her poor abused body but could see nothing through the tears. Marcia brought a tissue up to her nose and told her. "Blow. There, that wasn't so bad was it?" 

"But I didn't want to. We never mentioned down there!" Brooke whimpered. "Whoa! Stop that." Brooke cried. 

Joe was fiddling with the ring between her legs and it was doing something too pleasant. It felt painful but exciting at the same time. What she was complaining about was that a stranger was playing with her pussy! 

"That's enough. Come on guys; let me go now, please." Brooke pleaded. She decided not to berate them for assaulting her body as she was still strapped helpless and naked. Her dress was just a wrinkled mess around her waist. 

"Now you're here you might as well have a proper trim." Marcia told her. 

Brooke groaned but gave in. When the buzzing barber's trimmer touched sensitised skin she flinched then held very still as it was so close to her open swollen lips. With her legs held open she was self-conscious of what they could see of her excitement. The buzzing vibration was so erotic she felt an orgasm at last on its way. 

Too soon the task had been completed leaving her high but not dry. Joe sprinkled some powder and soothed the smooth skin between her legs. He had completely cleaned every hair from her pussy and she felt so much more naked and vulnerable before them. 

"So what do you think?" Joe asked. 

"A nice job Joe. That little pussy looks wonderful. It looks as though it needs kissing better though." Marcia said. 

"I can oblige." Joe laughed. 

"No that's my job." Marcia joked. 

With their eyes so attentive on her crotch Brooke felt like kicking out at them and inviting them both in all at the same time. "Please let me go now. You've had your fun I need to go." She whimpered. 

"Oh! I don't like the idea of being pissed on." Joe protested with a laugh. 

Marcia was becoming jealous of Joe's attention to her new friend and announced. "OK. Its time to go." 

"What do you say, Brooke." She asked. 

Brooke and Carlene had played this sort of game and so she caught on without too much prompting. "Thanks Joe for piercing my nipples and pussy. Thanks Marcia for bringing me here for Joe to pierce my nipples and pussy." She said through tight lips. 

She felt so humiliated already, this was just adding insult to injury. Brooke tenderly brought her legs together and lifted herself off the chair. The dress slid from around her waist to the floor and she wondered if she dare bend over with Marcia standing so close behind her. 

Any moment someone could enter the store to find her standing naked with these two strangers. Carefully she bent over with knees together trying not to squeeze her pussy between her legs. It had settled down to being sore from the initial stinging as though having been paddled or whipped. 

Gingerly she walked to the door relieved to be out of the torture chamber. She wondered what pleasure people got from having their body punctured like a pincushion. 'Damn! What if I can't have sex for awhile? I'll go crazy after all this bizarre stimulation. What a hell of a day it's been. What will Carlene say?' 

Thoughts were whirling through her head faster than the Honda could accelerate. 

Before Marcia could get her into any more trouble she accelerated away with the door slamming shut from the burst of speed. In the rear view mirror Marcia stood with hands on hips mouthing something at her. Running a stop sign Brooke slowed down and managed to bring her racing heart under control. 

Pulling over she slumped over the steering wheel and took a few deep breaths. "Damn them! Damn Marcia!" She shouted at the windscreen. "Why am I such a push- over? Carlene warned me. Damn! I'm going to have to remove these rings before I'm permanently marked. At least they didn't tattoo me." She burst out laughing at the thought. 

In the apartment she took a shower to ease her aching body. She was so tense her muscles ached all over. She needed to meet up with Carlene and tell her what had happened and ask for advice. The little metal rings turned around but didn't seem to have a place to be split, so how did they come out? 

Carlene was the only one she dare show them to and would probably know how to remove them. 

"I'm at the party, where are you? Come on over. Oh come on you'll enjoy yourself once you're here." Carlene shouted over the background noise of a party on her mobile phone. 

Brooke struggled to keep the speed down and not jump stop signs but got to the dorm party in record time. She had never gone to a party here but had visited Carlene in college once or twice. There was no need to ask the way for she heard the music from the parking lot. It was in the 'prat' house as Carlene called it. 

"I'm looking for Carlene." Brooke asked one of the girls. She noticed there were no men there. So this was one of the lesbian parties Carlene had told her about. The girl she asked was dressed as an angel, a fallen angel by the look of her. 

"Beatrice will know she knows everything." The girl said in a breathy voice in Brooke's ear. She led Brooke into another room where young women were standing around talking and laughing and touching, obviously enjoying themselves. 

Beatrice was dressed in not much more than leather straps with her breasts proudly on show. Brooke was rather startled at this flagrant display. She stood with feet apart as though in command of this party within a party. The others had stopped talking as soon as the confident woman turned to look Brooke over. 

Brooke preferred to just tease with a daring dress, though the sight of those proud tits jutting out was alluring. A drink was pushed into her hand and as she dragged her eyes away from those breasts she noticed the woman who had served her. 

She was dressed as a French maid in PVC. Her breasts were on display too yet she was obviously a submissive the way she dropped her eyes before Brooke's stare. Her whole demeanour was of a wholesome next-door girl despite the outfit she wore. 

"I'm looking for Carlene." Brooke said trying to keep her voice from trembling. She had played games with her friend but here she felt out of her league. The way Beatrice was looking at her she felt like prey before a mighty hunter. 

"Dance with me then I might tell you." Beatrice demanded. 

Before she could refuse the woman took both Brooke's hands and spun her round the room. With bodies seeming to fly around she became dizzy. Beatrice grabbed hold tight to steady her and started rubbing naked breasts against the thin summer dress flicking both their nipples back and forth. 

Brooke felt as though she was on show and had to pass some test but hadn't a clue what it was. 

"You're pierced. They must have been done recently as you wince when I touch them. Lets have a look at the work and I'll tell you who did the deed." She said. 

Brooke was nervous and would have stopped her but the woman had pulled down the front of the dress before she could react. She felt stupid as though the rules of this game were beyond her. 

"Ah, nice work! Look everyone she's been to Joe's. He does a good job, your lucky you didn't have the work botched by some amateur. They will be sore for awhile but it's worth it, you have such lovely tits girl." 

Brooke felt embarrassed with these strangers appraising her breasts, though they treated it with a casual disregard. 'Of course some of them were already displaying their breasts before I came in. It seems to be normal here.' She thought. 

Beatrice continued commenting on her beautiful body as she brought a chain out of a pocket. She clipped each end to the nipple rings all the time talking in a loud voice to the others. 

In a daze Brooke watched her do it to her breasts as though it were someone else's. The long light chain dangled from both nipples pulling at them teasing her with little sharp sensation of pain and sensual tingles. 

"Come and meet the others of our special little group." Beatrice said. 

She had no choice as the woman led her by the chain pulling at her nipples. If she wanted to avoid more pain she would have to follow the bitch. With her first step the dress slipped to the floor but all she could do was step out of it fearing to stop in case her nipples were damaged. 

"Ahh! You have a ring down there too. A very tasteful ring too!" She said. 

Brooke wasn't quick enough to move a hand in defence of her private place as the woman cupped her pussy in a hand feeling the fine steel loop between her legs. Brooke felt her take hold of her pussy lips with a gentle squeeze and all that days teasing of her body came flooding back to excite her. 

Rummaging in a pocket the woman produced another fine chain and connected it to the ring through her pussy lips. She then guided her to each of the friends to introduce Brooke to them. "Veronica, meet my new pet." She said with a sly smile. 

Pulling the chain linking her nipples Brooke was forced to bow to each in turn. She dare not speak with this woman holding the chain linking her nipples and pussy in each hand but meekly bowed in silent acquiescence. 

'No! How did this happen? Where is Carlene? This harridan has me moving around like a puppet on strings.' Brooke trembled inwardly. 

Cowering before strangers completely naked in such a vulnerable position was so humiliating; she needed help desperately. This woman had reduced her to a submissive state so rapidly her mind was in a whirl; she didn't know what to do. 

"Down pet, on your knees. At once. Good girl." Beatrice told her. From somewhere a collar was produced and someone pulled her hair up to buckle it around her neck. The chain from her nipples was clipped to the collar and a leash clipped to the collar too. 

On hands and knees she was led around the room and told to sniff her tormentor's friends between the legs. She had to sniff their bottoms too if they were standing up. One of the women thrust back and rubbed her arse against Brooke's nose. 

They all wanted a go now so she had to do the rounds again for them to thrust a pussy or bottom in her face. Brooke was mortified at being treated like some bitch off the street. With that woman holding onto the leash she was going no where unless she didn't mind ripping her nipples off in the escape. 

It seemed like an age since she had entered the room yet it had taken just half an hour to reduce Brooke to a docile pet. 

The strangers were laughing at her and thrusting their hips at her face. Eventually they grew tired of the game so she was led on sore knees to a corner where Beatrice sat on a cushion on the floor. Pulling on Brooke's collar brought her down between the woman's legs. She told her. "Let's see how good you are little pet, or do I have to teach you some tricks?" 

With one hand holding the leash she unzipped the leather trousers at her crotch and pulled Brooke forward. There was no let up on the assault on her senses, from pain in her nipples and pussy to mental torment she was being pushed to the limit. 

"Find my clit girl it's in there somewhere." Beatrice chuckled. "Bite on it. Oh yes you're learning." 

Brooke delved with her lips and teeth in the large folds of her labia never before experiencing such a succulent pussy. It was just as wet and slippery as her pussy felt. She had been stimulated all day and wanted nothing more than to be filled for an orgasm. 

Beatrice hardly moved when she declared it was enough. "Veronica you take her and try to improve the technique. Go on little pet, see what you can do to Veronica." She said with a wicked grin. 

Brooke felt the leash tighten as she was pulled away from the large hairy pussy before her. She dare not let the leash tighten too much as it pulled on her tender nipples. 

Veronica adjusted herself on a cushion with legs splayed. Her pussy was also very ready as the young woman anticipated the feel of Brooke's lips on her own. While bent forward with her head in the woman's lap and her arse up she felt yet another painful surprise. Someone had pushed a dildo up her arse. 

"The pet has a tail." They laughed. Brooke groaned with the indignity of it. 

The pet was forced to crawl around the room from one woman to another licking and sucking and biting. One young woman had such elongated lips it felt like she was sucking a soft penis into her mouth. 

"You did well pet. Go upstairs and wash up you're a mess. Then get back down here, I have plans for you tonight. We'll see how you like a bit of tit torture." Beatrice told her, with a horrid laugh. 

The maid helped her to her feet and pushed her in the direction of the stairs where others less exotically dressed sat and chatted. They stopped talking on seeing Brooke stumbling toward them with concerned looks on their faces. 

Her face and hair was a mess of pussy cum and it was sliding down over the collar finding its way through her cleavage. The chain between her legs was coated slickly from her own juices. Her mouth and tongue felt sore from the abuse as though she had chewed her way through a stick like a pet dog. She felt like a bitch on heat assaulted by the neighbourhood's dogs. 

The bathroom was easy to find but the queue parted on seeing her need was so obviously greater than there's. Leaning over the sink she looked at herself in the mirror and sobbed dry tears. She felt sore everywhere not wanting too move but managed to swill her face under the tap. 

It was no good she needed to shower. The cold water cleansed her body of their musty odour and she felt almost recovered. She dare not play with herself between the legs or she might be in there all night. She needed desperately something hard inside there or soon or she might go mad with lust. 

With a hand on the door she looked down at her naked body and wondered how she would make it down those stairs back to that room. She couldn't just walk out to her car and where were the keys? 

Brooke heard her friend's voice on the other side of the door. 'Trust Carlene to be impatient.' She thought, as she heard the shout and hammering on the door with a fist. 

"It's me." Brooke said, on opening the door. Carlene obviously hadn't recognised her at first. 

"What the hell happened to you?" 

"Beatrice . . ." She began to explain but Carlene interrupted. 

"Shit! That bitch! We had better get out of here." Carlene said, taking a hold of her hair. "It looks as though you've been initiated to their little club. I told you to look out for yourself. They are mean bitches." Carlene didn't need to scare her she was already terrified. 

They walked carefully down the fire escape trying to be silent so as not to attract attention. Half dragging an attractive young naked woman from a party made it all the more difficult. "My cars over here so keep moving we've nearly made it." Carlene encouraged her friend. 

In the dark Brooke was particularly careful of her bare feet in the grass. She stumbled but made it without falling. Feeling safe in the car Brooke wondered how she would get her thoughts together enough to tell her friend what had happened. 

"So that's a college party is it?" Brooke asked sarcastically. She still felt excited and hot. She was so turned on she thought the vibration from the road might bring her off. 

"No way! That is Beatrice and no one or nothing is like her. Just stay clear of her and the gang and you'll be OK!" Carlene told her. "And don't make a mess on my seats girl." 

They drove away into the night laughing together from simply being happy in each other's company. They knew what each was thinking and when Carlene turned into the drive to her apartment there was no need to invite her up as Carlene was already getting out of the car to help Brooke clamber out. 

Tonight was going to be one hell of a game!  

===

Brooke was black and beautiful with a body men craved to see and touch. She didn't mind them looking in fact she went out of her way to flaunt her body especially if it got her what she wanted. 

It was Saturday and as usual she met up with her friend Carlene to cruise the mall for clothes or just to see what might happen. Excitement and the thrill of walking into the unknown is what kept her high. 

Brooke sauntered out of the changing room wearing a light summer dress without underwear to check out another rack. The young check out girl was flustered on seeing her dressed so provocatively. Carlene nudged her, and the two young women shared a meaningful look and broke into giggles. 

Customers were peering at her from behind racks of clothes, some pretended to be outraged while others just admired the show. "Get my clothes from the changing room and put them in your bag." Brooke whispered to her friend. Carlene wondered what she was up to now. Carlene just hoped it wasn't going to get her into trouble again. 

Carlene knew Brooke since before high school and had got her into many a scrape just this side of the law. Carlene was a petite pale white chick, not as gorgeous as Brooke, but had a beautiful slim figure. She wasn't in love with Brooke but they were close. Pick on one of them and you'd soon find out how close. 

Brooke sauntered up to the girl swinging her hips seductively; the poor girl didn't know where to look. She was young and inexperienced and very pale looking as though she had just emerged from a library. She was easy prey for Brooke. The owner was out otherwise Brooke wouldn't have pulled this trick. 

"Hi. What's your name girl?" 

"Jane." She said. Just having to say her name brought on a stammer. She didn't stand a chance poor thing. 

"Can you help me with this zip? It's stuck." 

"I'm not sure. I." 

"Well I'll have to walk out of here wearing it if you don't get it off me." Brooke raised her voice with every word bringing attention to an already embarrassed Jane. 

Jane looked around for help but the manager was still out and the tight guy employed her cheap, not because she was clever. "OK." She meekly replied. 

They walked over to the changing room and Brooke drew closed the curtain behind her with a smile. She could be charming when she wanted but not right now. The girl pulled the zip and Brooke stepped out of it completely naked. Either Jane could push past her or wait nervously; and wait she did. 

"Hey! Where are my clothes?" Brooke acted surprised. She didn't try to cover herself she just stood there embarrassing Jane to the maximum. "I can't go home like this. What are you going to do! Someone's stolen my clothes." Brooke shouted adding a tone of contrived panic to her voice. 

"Its alright you can wear that dress. Just take it you don't have to pay." The girl stammered wanting her tormentor to get out and leave her alone. 

Brooke sighed heavily. This was too easy and no fun. "Get me some underwear I can't go outside like this." She demanded, with both hands drawing attention to her nakedness. 

Brooke had thought of getting the girl to go down on her but the pathetic creature was no challenge. Besides she had promised Carlene not to get into trouble, especially after what happened last week. 

The silly young thing brought her underwear and so she dressed and left quietly. She had the best clothes in the shop but wasn't satisfied, it had been too easy. 

"Come on Carlene, we are going up market, to the Pall Mall." 

"You promised to behave yourself and we don't have enough money to shop there." Carlene moaned. Knowing her friend was in a mood she shut up and kept quiet. The Honda sped along ignoring the speed limit as though such limitations were for the stupid and elderly. 

They walked into the most expensive store, admiring professionally the layout of displays. You couldn't shop lift here the way the racks were laid out with all the cameras covering them. Besides that wasn't Brooke's style. Occasionally, just for the fun of it she would force her friend to steal something; but not today. 

Trying on a dress Brooke snorted at the price tag. "That's what I call robbery." She said quietly. Brooke spotted a woman looking at her. 

The woman was almost twice her age but still attractive. Nice clear tanned skin and nothing artificial about her either. This woman was used to expensive vacations. Brooke noticed how the woman looked at her. 'Shit! Who the damn does she think she is?' Brooke thought. 

A glance at her watch and a plan formed in a flash of inspiration. "Carlene, grab the most expensive scarf off the rack. See that blonde with the big tits over there. Slip it into her bag." She commanded. "Don't worry about the cameras no one is watching. All the security guards will be watching the game in the canteen." She added. 

Carlene was relieved they wouldn't be the one's shoplifting. A silk scarf slid from a display into her palm and Carlene fell in step with the woman. The scarf was safely tucked away in a designer bag out of sight. She turned into a parallel aisle and followed the rich looking woman toward the exit. 

Carlene figured Brooke would wait until the coast was clear then lift the scarf from the stranger. Only, Brooke was mad at something and was in the mood for a challenge not this tired old ploy. Not only that the scarf had been picked at random not from Brooke's choice. 

As the woman stepped out of the store Brooke moved in. "Excuse me madam!" Brooke said. She used the commanding voice Carlene used to like when they were playing their naughty games together. "I'm store security and would like you to come with me back into the store. I believe there has been a mistake with your purchases this morning." 

Brooke watched an expression of confusion cross the woman's face and almost laughed but kept the serious look. She held a stern expression used at college imitating the principal to amuse friends. 

"You don't want to make a fuss out here do you Madam. If you resist I will have to call the police. I am sure we can sort the problem out if you come with me back into the store." Brooke said, with crossed fingers behind her back. 

"Oh, gosh, not the police! Yes. I'm sure there's been a mistake." She said, with a slight tremor to her voice. 

Brooke took the woman's elbow and marched her through the store to a staff entrance. Through a swing door then hesitated a moment confirming it was deserted. She knew the layout after being caught and given a hard time by security. 

"What is this about exactly?" The woman asked, starting to regain some composure. 

"I'm afraid there has been a report of shoplifting." Brooke said. She took the woman's elbow firmly guiding her down the corridor to the far room. "If you would like to empty your bag for me and give me the receipt we can soon sort this out." 

"But I don't shoplift. My fiancé gives me all the money I want to go shopping. Surely you can see I'm not the type." 

'Lucky bitch!' Brooke thought. "Well in my experience it takes all sorts. Some just do it for a thrill. Well this article doesn't seem to be on the bill." 

"I don't remember buying that!" she exclaimed. 

"Well that would explain why it's not on the bill. Do you do this often madam?" 

"No!" She said. Tears formed in the corner of her sparkling blue eyes. 

"Well I'm sure we can process this little problem quickly and have you on your way. I will of course have to check you haven't anything else hidden on you." Brooke said, trying hard not to laugh. She would strip the bitch and see how high and mighty she was after that. 

"What do you mean?" The woman asked. She trembled not wanting to hear the answer. 

"You can of course elect to be taken into custody for a police search but that would mean being charged for shoplifting. However, as this is your first time I don't think there is any need to call them. Do you?" 

"No. No not the police. I'll co-operate, whatever you say." She said looking contrite. 

"Good. Well then if you would like to take your clothes off and hang them on that rack. I will search them and you can go." 

Brooke watched the woman unzip the expensive silk dress and almost whistled at the sight of the in exotic underwear. Fortunately the woman faced away otherwise the expression on Brooke's face would have stopped her dead. 

The woman was wearing a silk bra and panty set with stockings and suspenders costing more than Brooke's monthly allowance. Her expression was one of envy and a leer of lust. She wanted the underwear and the woman. She looked good and Brooke could almost taste her. 

She was short with a cute ass, large soft breasts, flat tummy and a pair of grab-hold of me hips. The woman's lips were made to smooch but it would almost be a pity to spoil that expensive make over. 

Brooke had intended to take her clothes, lock the door and leave her to the security men. All that suddenly changed. She looked at her watch. There was plenty of time. Looking through draws in the desk she recognised the forms for such cases. 

At the back of a draw was a pack of gloves, tight latex gloves. 

Brooke was pleased she hadn't been caught with anything on her last time she had been taken here. She would have relented to the big man if he had pushed her for she enjoyed being dominated as well as dominating. With her hand in the draw she loosened a ring and palmed it. 

"Just sign this release form and I can search the dress and you can go." 

"But there's nothing hidden. Can't you let me go now, please?" She said demurely. She was looking up through a fringe cut straight in the long blond hair, meaning to be cute and innocent. It might be appealing to her friend but she wouldn't win sympathy from Brooke. 

"I have to do my job otherwise I'll be the one in trouble." Brooke told her sternly. 

Sliding her hands through the dress she stopped and pulled out the ring. "What's this?" 

"I didn't buy that!" She wailed pathetically. 

Brooke didn't let the woman see the ring too closely in case she recognised it was a cheap imitation. "I see. Well, this is more serious. Caught stealing one item means a caution; two has to be reported to the police. It's company policy." 

"You're name is Sandy." Brooke said, reading from the form. "Sit down this might take some time." Brooke said. She picked up the phone. 

Sandy went to sit as told but in just her silk panties saw the chair was too nasty. "No. You don't have to do that. I'll pay for everything. I'll give you a bonus. I'll max out my credit card for you. Please, don't call the police." Sandy begged. 

Sandy leant over the desk giving Brooke a pleasing view of her cleavage. Her breasts were wobbling nicely with each panting breath she took, showing how natural they were 

"Are you sue you have nothing else?" 

"No. No of course not. I don't know how they got there in the first place. I didn't steal them, honest!" 

"Quiet. Let me think a moment. How can I be sure you haven't concealed more jewellery?" Brooke asked, with a glint of menace in her eyes. 

"You can search me. Honest, there can't be anything else." 

"I don't know. I should call the police. OK. I'll give you one more chance. Take off that underwear and I'll search it." 

At first she eagerly pulled off the stockings not caring if she laddered them. With a shy glance at Brooke she held her hands to her back gripping the bra catch. Her breasts were thrust out bulging over the bra with each deep breath. She struggled in panic then snapped the catch and handed Brooke the bra. 

The woman stood covering her large breasts with both arms wrapped around her. She cringed with embarrassment yet at the same time was desperately trying to show an eagerness to please. 

With great difficulty Brooke kept a straight face trying hard not to stare at the great pair of white tits hovering before her. She was impressed how they hardly dropped once free of the bra. The bra was a simple lacy thing well made and she could appreciate that too. 

"Now remove the panties Sandy. It's OK I've seen plenty in my time." Brooke said casually. Well that at least was true. 

Brooke stood up and walked around the woman. She didn't know which way to turn to preserve her dignity. The blush colouring her face spread down her neck over her breasts revealing the deep embarrassment she felt. 

"Now bend over the desk and spread you r legs." Brooke stated harshly. 

"No you can't? Well you've been brave so far. I can still call the police. Do you want me to do that? They'll do this down at the station more thoroughly than I will." Brooke grinned, hoping it wouldn't show in her voice as she stood behind the gorgeous blond. 

She stood and admired the pale globes of her ass. The cheeks were hard and tight from working which probably explained why she had such an admiring friend. 

When Brooke's glove covered hand touched her pale ass Sandy quivered. She went to stand and struggle but Brooke held a palm against her back. "Hold still Sandy. It'll soon be over and you can go home and forget all about it." Brooke lied. 

Sandy felt cold lubricant being massaged around her anus and whimpered. It was so humiliating to be treated this was. She hadn't given her virgin asshole to anyone and this lowly security woman was taking it. To have this young black woman treat her like this was so degrading she felt as though she would faint. 

"Stop wriggling. Try to relax those muscles. That's it." Brooke commanded. Her finger slid in up to her palm cupping the hard cheeks of the woman's bottom. The woman braced herself with legs stiff. "That wasn't so bad was it? You're gripping my finger Sandy. You'll have to relax so I can get it out without hurting you." She lied. 

"While you're trying to relax I'll check down here." Brooke told her. 

Sandy was trying to block out the horrid experience and only vaguely heard what the young woman was telling her. It was expected yet nevertheless a shock. She felt a finger enter her pussy. There had been no foreplay, not that he was very attentive but at least she was given a chance to prepare. 

Sandy felt the two fingers inside wriggle as though searching out a deep private secret. The finger up her anus was pressing against the two in her pussy and the novel sensation was turning her on. 

It didn't help that the young woman's thumb was inadvertently nudging her clit. This was too much to tolerate. With just the one hand she had a finger up her ass, two fingers in her pussy and a thumb nudging her bud. 

'No! She's doing this on purpose. I can't let her do this to me.' She cried inside feeling ashamed. It seemed impossible to move. Her body wanted more and her mind was giving in. 

Brooke knew what she was doing and did it well. Carlene had thanked her enough times to know exactly where and how. She reached the woman's inner button and pressed it. There was no way she was going to escape now. 

"I had better help you relax or I'll never get my finger out your ass." Brooke lied trying to sound bored but repressing a giggle. She reached round with a free hand and weighed a plump breast. Pumping it a little gently then pinching the nipple seemed to have been just the right action. 

After a deep sigh the woman's breathing continued with short deep gasps. It soon turned to breathless pants. Brooke new she was close. She would have left her like this humiliated and desperate for completion only the plan had changed. She enjoyed the sound of the pathetic mewing. 

"Do you want more?" Brooke whispered into her ear. 

"Yes!" She gasped. 

Brooke understood completely what Sandy was going through. She had been humiliated and desperate to cum herself with Carlene calling the tune. She too knew what buttons to press. Expert fingers rubbed that special little button deep inside while her thumb rubbed the clit in a regular rhythm. 

The finger up her ass pressed and wriggled adding pressure on the inner walls between anal passage and pussy. Every little movement was now an ecstasy of sensations. 

"Do you want to come?" Brooke asked. 

"Yes!" She gasped on a ragged out breath. 

"Ask me nicely bitch!" Brooke whispered close to her ear. 

"Please let me come. Please!" 

"Tell me you're my white bitch and I'll let you come." 

"I'm you're bitch. I'm you're white bitch. I'll do anything. Please, just let me come. Please!" She begged. 

Brooke subtly changed the rhythm finding the woman's key to completion. The violent shuddering in her legs flapped her bottom cheeks. The movement travelled to her belly then shook her breasts. The orgasm was impressive to watch. Brooke had been right about her. 

Sandy collapsed upon the table exhausted emotionally and physically. Brooke guided her onto the floor and with a hand in her hair pulled her face into her crotch. "You said you would do anything. Let's see how good you are at keeping your word." 

Brooke didn't expect much and she was right. The pampered rich woman hadn't a clue. Rather than simply leave her here Brooke decided to teach the bitch some manners and a few tricks. 

"With your tongue, find my clit bitch. I found yours easy enough. Bite on it. Easy! Put your tongue in, right in." She commanded. 

"You don't have a clue do you. Well I don't mind taking the time to teach you." Brooke told her. 

She stood in a daze letting Brooke pull the dress over her head. All the time Brooke whispered little re-assuring words to her. With the underwear tucked into a bag Brooke took her elbow to guide her out of the store. 

From down the corridor she heard the loud cheering meaning a goal had been scored by their team. The security guys would be busy for a while. "Men! Poor dumb animals." She said. 

*** 

The thin silk dress revealed a clear outline of Sandy's body in the full glare of the sun as they crossed the car park. Brooke cared little about that and Sandy had withdrawn to a little world of her own. 

The woman was in shock and was completely docile as Brooke led her out to the car. Shoved into the back seat with Carlene they pulled away. "Just stroke her hair and coo in her ear Carlene." 

Carlene knew what to do and stroked the long blond hair and her breasts and between her legs. They had learnt together how to stimulate the skin and keep going long after the initial orgasm. 

The woman was out of it completely and Carlene wished it had been her that had been so completely taken. She thought of so many things she would like to do to this sexy woman once they got home, both nasty and nice things. 

*** 

Brooke and Carlene pulled Sandy out of the car, each taking an arm they propelled her into the apartment. This rich white woman would be noticed in their neighbourhood so they needed to hurry. Once inside Carlene bolted the door and they felt safe with their new toy. Brooke intended to teach this rich bitch not to look down on her, but much more than that hadn't been planned 

Carlene pulled the expensive silk dress up over Sandy's head. In an automatic response Sandy covered her breasts, clamped her thighs together and blinked her eyes as though just awakening from a deep sleep. She stood in the middle of a sparsely furnished apartment not knowing where she was. 

"Down on your knees Bitch. You have been a bad girl. You came all over my fingers and didn't clean them up like you should. You came nicely didn't you though?" She asked. 

"Speak to me Sandy. Tell me how nicely I made you come. Say thank you Mistress." 

"Thank you, mistress." Sandy quavered. She couldn't think clearly all she knew was that this was trouble, big trouble. Her legs threatened to give way she was so scared. Over the pounding of her heart were other sensations, naughty sensations that were urging her to give in. 

Her rich boyfriend had lectured to her about being kidnapped, what to do and how to behave. 'Do as you're told and try to win them over. Get them to treat you and think of you as a human being and not an object for sale.' He had said.  

===

Brooke would have laughed if the woman had revealed she thought of this as a kidnapping. The two young women simply thought this rich bitch wanted an adventure, a distraction in her mundane shopping life, a bit of rough play. 

"Now crawl over here and lick my fingers." Brooke told her. She nodded at Carlene who was waiting eagerly behind the woman. She crawled over to Brooke and started to lick the hand that was shoved into her face. Brooke sat with the dress up around her waist, legs open in anticipation. 

Sandy was mortified to be naked in this stranger's apartment licking her own juices from their fingers. It was as though it was a nightmare and someone else was pulling the strings; she wasn't responsible for this lewd act. 

Her mind rebelled and she was about to protest when someone touched her from behind. Smooth hands caressed her bottom and thighs. It was delicious. From the moment she had stripped in that awful room extraordinary sensations had caught her off guard and now she was succumbing to them all over again. 

Brooke lifted her legs over the arms of the easy chair spreading them wide. She moved Sandy's hand between her legs with the woman's lips still licking away at them. Pulling her hand away the woman's face dropped into her crotch. With a hand gripping Sandy's hair Brooke thrust her hips ensnaring Sandy's face into her crotch. 

Carlene moved in on queue and sucked at Sandy's lips nudging her asshole with her nose. She grabbed the woman's breasts and squeezed. Sandy made bubbling noises between Brooke's pussy lips; the sounds were muffled words and groans of illicit pleasure. 

The light shone through the window on the scene with the three women's bodies locked together, locked into their own little world of pleasure. Sandy, unused to such an onslaught upon her body soon came, but wasn't released. 

The two young friends' had played this sort of game many times and knew how to make the pleasure last. 

Carlene's tongue and fingers worked her skilfully with an enthusiasm that came from a desire that it would be her turn soon. With such devilish illicit sensations spurring her on Sandy delved deep into Brooke with teeth grazing the young woman's bud, almost gnawing on it in animal lust. 

Brooke's orgasm was less physical and more mentally satisfying from teaching this rich bitch not to look down on her. If she saw her out shopping in the future this woman would know to lower her head in shame. Or, maybe something more, maybe the woman would look at her with lust in her eyes. 

That was an interesting idea. "Ok bitch you can start on Carlene now. First, what do you say? Thank you . . ." Brooke looked down at Sandy on all fours the woman's head pinched between her thighs. Brooke squeezed in way of encouragement. 

The woman looked confused and a little distraught. 'Funny thing an orgasm it affects every one differently.' Brooke mused. "Well? What does my little white bitch have to say for herself?" 

"Thank you, mistress." She whispered. 

"After all that effort a little more enthusiasm is called for." She said while gesturing with a hand to Carlene. 

"Owwww!" Sandy yelped. Carlene raised her hand to slap the woman's ass again but was stopped by a look from Brooke. 

"Your little white bitch says a big thank you for making me cum sooo much, mistress." She said looking up through the neat fringe with big wide blue eyes. 

Brooke smiled at the tone of voice. This rich woman was talking like a little namby-pamby rich girl to her daddy expecting an expensive present. Well that was cutting no ice with her. 

"You're dismissed bitch. Crawl over to Carlene and learn something." 

She watched the woman's white ass wiggle across the room and wondered if it was too tight for one of her toys. 'Hell! Why not? She could leave if she didn't enjoy the rough treatment. That's what she's here for isn't it?' She thought while grinning at the look of anticipation on Carlene's face. 

Sandy whimpered uncontrollably into the girls' pussy sending vibrations of pleasure over the sopping lips. At least she wasn't being suffocated as before as this one had spread her legs wide. She could feel tongue and jaw aching now the orgasm had waned. 

The tingling was still there but at least she could now think straight. She had never ever experienced such powerful feelings; they had taken her over so completely it left a serious doubt about her sexual preferences. Disturbing doubts. 

Carlene leaned back into the sofa with a pleasant smile upon her face. The technique was lousy but she could stand it all day if necessary. A bit of playing around being submissive with her friend was one thing but this rich pampered woman was beyond the pale. 'Why was she debasing herself like this? Who cares anyway?' She thought. 

"Oh!" A muffled yelp from Sandy sent an added vibration into Carlene. 

"Hey! Don't blow in me I don't want to be pussy farting the rest of the day." Carlene complained. 

Sandy tried escaping into the young woman's crotch from an unexpected attack on her ass. She hardly noticed the soothing feel of oil being applied to her crack. When a hard something pressed her asshole the pain caused her to react. 

She froze and needed prodding by Carlene to continue the delicious labour of licking and sucking and probing. She was learning but wouldn't earn full marks yet. 

Brooke sat back in the arm chair with a remote control in one hand, her pussy in the other and a devious smile plastered across her face. Pressing a button made the dildo in Sandy's ass wriggle. Sandy yelped involuntarily moving forward pressing her face into Carlene's pussy causing her to groan from the extra stimulation. 

Another button was pressed and Carlene felt teeth sawing across her on button and let out a groan. Brooke sat back twiddling her swollen lips, pressing buttons, watching the two women reacting. 

First one would push forward with a yelp then the other would groan or bark or whimper. It was both amusing and sexy to watch. Brooke pinched and pulled at lips and rubbed her clit in time with the two of them motivated by the remote control she held. 

*** 

Sandy collapsed on the floor unaware her tormentors had fallen asleep. Just before she too fell into a troubled sleep disturbing thoughts roamed her mind. She hoped her boyfriend paid the ransom quickly. 

'I've never had so many deep orgasms in my life they are turning me into a sex fiend. They've already made me so submissive I can't think straight. I can't stand much more of this humiliation otherwise I'll never be the same again.' 

*** 

Brooke noticed a shadow loom over her. The outline of a large man in a suit was all she could see. How long had he been watching them was the first thought that came to mind. 

"Get up Sandy." He said calmly. His deep commanding voice was casual but somehow it resonated with menace. 

She watched another man pull Carlene off the sofa by her hair and dump her in a heap on the floor. Brooke couldn't move. She lay back in the easy chair with her legs spread where she had been busy on her pussy. It glistened in the sunshine wet and slippery. 

In a panic she drew her legs together and knees up to her chest to protect her nakedness. "Who are you? What are you doing here? Get out!" She shouted. 

The panic drove her anger but before she could act a slap across the ass and another across her head stopped her cold sending a shiver of fright through her body. She sat there realising they meant business what ever it was. 

One of the men pulled both arms up above her head while the other ripped the dress clean in two leaving it to slither to the floor. 

"You keep quiet and your friend doesn't get hurt." He said. The matter of fact tone to his voice told her this was his trade and he knew what he was about. She looked across at Carlene crumpled into a ball on the floor and nodded her head. 

Brooke saw there were three of them. One had dressed Sandy by pulling the dress over her body. Another had a hold of Brook's arms behind her back. The other pulled Carlene off the floor holding her by the arm dangling her off the floor like a toy. 

"Stand up woman or you'll hurt your arm." He told her. If he shook her while holding her like that he would dislocate her shoulder. Eventually she extended her legs and touched the floor with her toes. 

"We're ready to go." The tallest of the three strangers said. 

They all wore black suits with black wraparound sunglasses hiding their eyes. With black highly polished shoes and deep-bronzed tans the only other colour about them was the bright white shirts. No personality had been revealed just the quiet controlled menacing voice meaning Brooke should not mess with them, or else. 

Two by two they left the building. Carlene was partly dressed but Brooke was manhandled naked out into the street. Her shapely figure was noticed immediately and a three-man crowd cheered. 

It was choked off on focusing on the big man gripping her arms. If there had been more support the young men would have assaulted the three white men just for being there let alone roughing up one of their own. 

Even so they made a move then thought better of it when the three stopped dead and stared at them in unison like a wall ready to fall upon them. Before Brooke could plead for help a slight shake shot a stabbing pain through her arms. She felt like a rag doll in the hands of petulant child. 

Pushed into the back of a Cadillac she fell to the floor and was stamped on by Sandy as she too was pushed in after her. She looked up at the legs resting on her and almost sobbed. No she was not going to give in as the other two had. Given the chance she would fight. 

One large shape slid behind the wheel and one beside Sandy with is feet holding Brooke to the floor; where was Carlene? The muffled thump of the trunk answered her question. The third man slumped down into the passenger seat up front. 

He turned to the back and slapped Brooke on the rump. "Keep your head down. We are going to deliver you to the boss. He wants a word with you." He said. 

The perfect diction and callous disregard for her condition spelt professional. Brooke wasn't going to test the idea by arguing or even opening her mouth. She was in trouble and would find out what kind soon enough. 

On the ride she wondered what she had done over the last few weeks. There hadn't been anything exciting or too over the top recently. Was it something remotely connected with a trick or game she had played on someone? 

The car slowed to a stop and she contemplated trying for the door handle. Before she could react Sandy grabbed it and rattled it seriously, violently, desperately pulling at it. Neither of the guys up front nor the man holding her down reacted. They were serious guys knowing their business and of course it was locked. 

Sandy sobbed silently, her shoulders humping up and down being the only clue. 

Brooke heard the spatter of a gravel road and considered this was their destination. Either they were out of town in the country and this was a one-way trip or they had arrived at a rich someone's home. 'Who?' She thought 'Or should it be whom?' She felt like asking them to drop her off at the college library to check it out. 

Brooke was right about the second guess this was a rich mans home. The three women were ushered out of the car and trunk, this time a little more decorously. The three men gave them time to pull their clothing together. Watching the other two Brooke became even more embarrassed and wrapped her arms tighter about a naked body for maximum coverage. 

'This is no way to enter a rich mans home.' She thought. A giggle almost broke from her lips but it turned into a dry sob before it could become hysteria. 

'I will not be scared!' She told herself. 

The six of them marched into the house, through shadowy corridors and out into the sunlight once more. Brooke was impressed with the luxury of the house. It wasn't so much a house as a well-appointed mausoleum. Stone statues and marble were in plentiful supply out by the pool too only on a grander scale. 

*** 

A man's bald shiny head appeared over the edge of the pool. 

Shiny head was obviously the boss and he didn't look pleased to see them. His smile directed at Sandy was a grimace. He obviously knew her so that answered the mystery as to what this was all about. Sandy was keeping a low profile as though she could hide out here in the sun beside the pool. 

The largest of the three suites bent over his boss then gave up trying to bend his iron frame so got down on one knee. They talked quietly all the while Mr Shiny looked at her with a look of a barracuda eyeing lunch. They both looked at the three women and the bald man grimaced. As usual no expression registered on Mister Black Suit number one. 

"So you're the bitch who kidnapped my friend. She is, or was my personal assistant. Very personal! I'll have to go to the trouble of finding someone new." He said while shaking his head slowly attempting a look of sorrow and failing. It didn't seem as though this man was familiar with personal pain or the concept of not getting what he wanted. 

"I'll be your personal assistant. I can be very personal. I'm good at very personal." Brooke blurted out trying to bat her eyelashes at him. Maybe this would work out after all. He was appraising her body like every man she had ever met. When she met his eyes a cold shiver cancelled out the suns warmth. 

There was a nice view over the valley and the pool was designed to look as though it spilt over the edge. She made a wish but as usual nothing happened. Maybe if she had a coin to throw in the pool it might help. There was no point in patting her pockets she had none. 

"Nice try but not good enough. If it had been my wife you would have been dead by now. For what you did to Sandy you will be punished. No one touches what belongs to me." The boss told her. 

Two of the black suites dragged a heavy chair over, its legs squealing annoyingly on the dry surface of the marble. They just as casually walked behind Brooke and took her arms in a firm grip. The two suits stretched her over the back of the chair to tie her wrists to its arms. 

Number one suit appeared before her undoing his leather belt. In the limited vision she had, bent over the chair, she watched him slip it from around his waist like a snake uncurling. He straightened and flexed his muscles like a wall heaving in an earthquake. 

'Damn him and damn them all.' She thought. She hung her head in shame knowing what the punishment was. She was mortified at the thought of it. 

They intended to thrash her in front of everyone, before her beloved friend Carlene. Her legs squirmed uncontrollably. There was no escape she would have to take the punishment and try not to give them the satisfaction of screaming. 

The sound reached her brain as a muffled sound as though far away for she was desperately trying to separate her self from the awful humiliation happening behind her. The pain quickly followed and she bit heavily on her bottom lip. The boss watched her closely so she closed her eyes in defence. 

He was just a couple of feet away looking up at her smiling adding to the humiliation with his own brand of enjoyment. He was branding her soft cheeks without even leaving the pool. 

She was surprised it had ended so quickly. They may be experts in exerting pressure on men, as their look was enough to curb dissent, but here her stepfather could have taught them a more effective technique. 

Number one suit stood to one side where she could look down at his shiny black shoes while he buckled his belt. 'Was it really over?' She thought. 'They didn't seem so tough.' She decided. One of the other two suits silently pulled the buttons of his fly open. A zip would have been heard and understood giving Brooke some warning. 

Brooke felt a large pair of hands grip her hips and something hard prod her lips. At last she understood the punishment had seriously begun. "No!" She yelled. The sound escaped her lips without thought before she could clamp her mouth shut. The boss stared at her with grip she couldn't shake. 

She tried to shake her head free of the fear coursing through her body. She told herself to relax and make it easier on her poor pussy. She watched the boss nod and felt the hard throbbing cock shaft her. It plunged in all the way seeming to stretch tight muscles. 

He was big but she had taken Carlene fitted with larger dildos. He wouldn't hurt her but she had to try and relax. A little whimper escaped her lips for she had just realised how excited her body had become. This was a nightmare but her body was responding to it. The boss was smiling benignly at her as though watching a favourite bitch being mounted. 

The bosses face swam in her vision as the big black suit rocked her back and forth with her head nodding in rhythm. He was rough riding her and she could feel every movement and the occasional deep thrust hitting the entrance to her womb. She felt everything in a detached mood except her breathing was now ragged with gasps every time he rubbed the spot. 

The bald man continued his amused gaze, which she tried to return with equal calm. It was a game she was destined to lose but she was determined. 

A final pounding and he stopped. She felt the quivering shake as he spurted deep into her. As though her body had been lying to her, just fooling all along that she was in control it gave in to a sudden small orgasm. She moaned a little gasp partly in surprise. Her whole body shivered. It was not a pleasant thing as with someone she wanted, it was a release from an ordeal endured. 

Brooke watched another pair of black shiny shoes walk around the side of her and when they stopped she closed her eyes tight. The third black suit had taken up position behind her. Her arse was pointing up at him exposing everything but it was his disinterest that was so humiliating. 

She gritted her teeth no longer able to play the bitter game with their horrid boss. She closed her eyes in shame. "No!" She squawked. This time it was a plea for mercy rather than a shout of defiance. 

She felt his hard cock nudge her in the wrong place. She opened her eyes in anguish looking at the bald man languidly leaning on the edge of the pool before her. She cried out again abandoning any hope of keeping up an appearance of strength. "Please! Not that. You'll hurt me." She pleaded. 

There wasn't the slightest trace of pity in those eyes. Trying to unclench her cheeks in anticipation of the pain and the indignity, she braced herself. With the last remaining strength she summoned the will to relax. It would be less painful if she could just let him in. 

The head of his penis pressed against her dry arse hole. A last desperate plea was summoned as she gazed into the boss's eyes begging for release. It was a forlorn hope. The man looked over her shoulder and nodded his head. She felt the penis thrust in, more slowly this time for she was so tight. 

Her poor tight arse felt hot with pain. It was being stretched wide with his hardness pushing ever deeper. It seemed to go on forever deeper and deeper into her body. "No! Please stop. No more. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." She whimpered. 

One more time she opened her eyes to plead with her tormentor only to see a sardonic grin without the slightest shadow of pity on his face. The relief at feeling the hard thrusting rhythm slow then stop was short lived as he jerked on an orgasm. The relief turned to great shame as she felt his hot sperm warming a deeper part of her anal passage. 

The monster had given her a sperm enema. Tears formed in her eyes on feeling the indignity of what he had done to her. She collapsed in a heap over the chair unable to believe she could stand any more of this abuse.  

===

"Well I think that's enough, for now." The Boss told her. "You had better thank these, gentleman for your punishment." 

Number one suit stood in front of her and lifted her head by the hair and she managed to speak. "Thank you for thrashing me." She sobbed. 

Another suit held her head up looking at the make-up smeared face. "Thank you for fucking me." She said with a sniff. 

The last black suited stranger lifted her head and she was tempted to spit in his face as he peered at her. If she had the energy or saliva it would have been worth it what ever they did in retaliation. "Thank you for raping my ass." She whimpered. 

Wasn't it enough to have defiled her body that they had to make her thank them? How much did they want to smash her self-esteem? At least it was over. If she had the strength to rise up, now the bonds had been cut from her wrists and ankles, she would run and hide. Hide from the world not just these monsters. They weren't human. 

"One more thing before you leave. Carlene here will be my guest until you have paid in full for the damage you have done. In the meantime, I do like that word, meantime. Well, you will just have to do as you are told when summoned. Otherwise these gentlemen will bring you back here for something more unpleasant." 

Mister number one suit took a hold of her arms and lifted her away. Falling onto the back seat she sprawled out over the leather. 

"Here take this." He handed her a card. "If anyone gives a card with that phrase you are to obey them. Whatever they want, you will do. Understood?" He asked coldly. 

She nodded her head. 

"Don't spill anything on the leather seats or you'll lick it off." He told her. Throwing a rag at her he turned his large shoulders to the front and the car sped away with a spurt of gravel. 

She pulled the rag under her recognising it had been Carlene's dress. Her body was seeping sperm from her pussy and asshole. Though both were still numb she wondered how much they would hurt. The important thing in her little shattered life at the moment was not to contaminate the leather with their sperm leaking from her body. 

*** 

Dumped on the sidewalk Brooke quickly scrambled to pull the dress on. Her breasts were larger and she was taller than Carlene so it hardly covered her. Despite the disgusting blobs of cum and juice splattered over it she was relieved to be away from those monsters, though not completely free. 

Hurriedly she hobbled down the street to her apartment every move an agony. 

*** 

Laying in a hot bath she tried to digest what the Boss had told her. He will keep Carlene until they both had repaid him, until fully punished. Brooke wondered what the hell he might do to her. That fiend said she would be his pet to play with and her treatment would depend on Brooke's obedience. 

She read the business card and memorised the phrase. Whoever gave her that phrase would own her. "Damn!" She cried out. "Why me? Please let me wake up and let this be a nightmare." She shrieked. A thump from the ceiling told her there were normal people in the world with normal concerns, simply wanting a quiet evening in. 

Her world wouldn't be normal for some time to come. She dare not think what perverts would do to her in the next few weeks. Strangers would hand her a business card and expect her to perform for them. Surely there would be some way out of this disgusting mess!  

===

The first card turns up- she receives her first task master. (It might be better to read the previous chapter to make sense of this chapter.) 

* 

Sunday morning Brooke awoke still fuzzy from a night of intense dreams. A deep feeling of loss turned to anger as she became aware; yesterday wasn't just a dream but a real nightmare of a day. 

The knocking on the door with the doorbell ringing pulled her aching body from the bed. The impatient knock and bell ring! It could only be her friend Carlene. That bastard of a thug had let her go! She ran to the door and wrenched it open. As suddenly as the door was opened she slammed her arms around her naked body. 

"Brooke?" the young man stammered. 

The anger overflowed and she shouted at him. "What the hell do you want nerdy boy?" Brooke looked him up and down with an obvious look of disdain. She recognised him from school so he was nineteen, the same as Brooke, but she didn't know him well. 

Last time they met he had smiled shyly at her while trying to make conversation. They had been at the same high school and would be in the same college next week so he thought they could hang out together. She had shrugged her shoulders and turned away, spurning his attempted friendliness. 

Standing naked before a guy of her own age would be embarrassing but she felt infuriated and he was about to receive the full venom worked up from yesterday's disgusting degradation. He stood before her looking like a startled rabbit in the searing light of her fiery temper. 

Before she could give him the benefit of her acid wit she noticed the blue card in a trembling outstretched hand. "Where did you get that? Talk!" 

"My uncle," he managed to stammer. 

"Shit! Who's your uncle?" she spat angrily. 

"Freddy," he said, sounding apologetic. 

"A bald guy, with a swimming pool, fancy house out in the sticks, with body guards in black suits built like brick walls?" she demanded. 

"Yea, I guess so," he spluttered. 

"You had better come in," Brooke ordered. 

"It's OK!" he said anxiously. "I didn't know it would be you! Sorry," he said in confusion. 

He had enough presence of mind to hide the card in his hand but just stood staring at her. 

"Don't stand there with your tongue hanging out looking stupid. I want a talk with you," she said, with more than a hint of a threat in her voice. 

She turned quickly, expecting him to follow. He took a tentative step, following it with another, until he was through the door not thinking to close it. His eyes were on her ass, mesmerised by a dimple in the left cheek, formed with every stride. 

"Close the door," she shot at him over a shoulder. 

He hurried to comply then tripped along the corridor to catch up, only to fall into her bedroom. 

"I'm getting dressed!" she complained. 

"Here, give me that damn card," she ordered. Ripping it from his hand she cared little that he had, what was for him, a tantalising close up view of her naked body. He had seen everything when she opened the door and at the moment there were more important things than covering her nakedness. 

One glance told her it was one of those cards. When someone presented one of these damnable cards she would have to obey them. Otherwise, her friend would suffer. The thought of Carlene held as a hostage by that mobster sent a shiver of fear through her. If she didn't play his cruel game her friend would be punished. The thought of what he might do to her brought her down. 

"It's OK! I won't, I don't want to, I mean. I'll just go," William suggested. He didn't make a move while torn between ogling her body, feeling guilty and curious. What did his uncle have over her that she was working for him like this? It was bound to be over money but how did she get mixed up with him? 

Brooke shook herself. She didn't notice his eyes following the bounce of her breasts as there were more pressing matters. "So, when did he give you that card," she asked, at last becoming calmer. 

She picked up a dress from the floor to sniff a pit and shrugged it on over her head. It was less sweaty than she was. 

"Last night. My father took me there on one of his rare family visits. He slipped me the card," William said, while following her into the kitchen. He remembered the smirk and suggestion that he could do whatever he wanted with the woman. He felt belittled by the suggestion that he could lose his virginity at last. 

"I didn't know it was you. I don't want you," he hesitated, unable to continue with uncle's vulgar words in his head. 

"What? You don't like black pussy?" she smirked at his timidity. 

"Yea, I mean, I don't expect you to, err, to honour the agreement. I'll just make something up," he said lamely. 

"Do you like your coffee black?" she asked. 

Realising the milk was off he nodded his head. 

"You're going to help me with this," she told him, waving the card and shoving a mug of coffee at him. 

"Did you see Carlene?" she said, with a look of worry on her face. 

He wrinkled his brow in confusion. "Could be, I didn't see her face but saw someone there," he stopped short. He knew they were good friends and wondered what it was all about. 

"Did you see her or not?" she yelled at him. Calming herself she asked again. "What did you see, Willy," she asked more gently. 

He looked away. "A young woman, she was naked. She ran from the pool when we came in. I only got a glimpse of her, didn't know it was Carlene but it could have been," he said, trying to pacify her. 

"Was it that bitch, what's her name, Sandy?" Brooke asked. 

"No, I didn't see her. That was unusual, she's usually waiting on uncle all the time," he said. 

"I guess you didn't bother to look at the naked girls face!" Brooke said testily. 

"She slipped away quickly before my dad could see her," William said, in defence. "She was slim, short, dark short hair," he shrugged. 

"Must be her," Brooke sighed. 

"What's going on Brooke? Why is she there?" he asked, leaving out the question of why she was subjecting herself to this card thing. 

"She's there to make sure I do as I'm told. Whenever someone presents one of these cards I have to follow instructions," she grimaced. 

"Bloody hell," William whistled. 

"Exactly right," she whispered. "You gointa help me outa this?" 

"What can I do?" he asked. 

He looked as though he meant it and while she had him hooked intended wringing out of him every little bit of sympathy. "You can help by giving a good report to your uncle. First, tell me all you know about him." 

He told her a little about uncle Freddy's background but wasn't sure what he got up to these days. There was some kind of drug connection as well as sordid clubs, and gambling, but his side of the family kept clear of that so-called business. 

"We visit rarely as he's considered the black sheep of the family. My mom hates him. Dad doesn't tell her I visit with him," he added. 

"When are you supposed to report back on my compliant behaviour?" she asked. 

"I'm supposed to phone him tonight. Oh! A message, you're supposed to go to a club, the Golden Chain. Be there by seven," he said, with a shrug, meaning he had no idea what it meant. 

Brooke grimaced. She had never been there but knew of its bad reputation and that was enough of a clue as what was expected of her. "What about the police? Do they watch him or want him?" she asked. 

"Dad said he keeps away from the sharp end of the business these days. I guess they know of him," William explained. 

Brooke wished her friend was here. Carlene would have been able to work out some kind of plan. Either the consternation showed on her face or she had thought out loud for William butted in on her thoughts. 

"I can help, I want to," he said. 

"We need to get Carlene out of there, she's in serious trouble and so am I, if we don't," she sighed, leaving what sort of trouble unsaid. It seemed she had accepted the need of help and he was the only one at the moment. 

"There might be a way. When I was little I fell into the pool drainage channel. There's a grill the other end, outside the walls. If it could be loosened that's a way in and out," he said. His excitement grew as he thought it through. 

"Uncle Freddy doesn't get up until late, so the best time to break in would be early in the morning," he enthused. 

Brooke pulled him to her for a strong hug. "Do you think you could get us in?" she breathed into his ear. "I would be so grateful," she cooed. She felt his cock hardening and pressed up against him. His innocence and sincerity was a refreshing change from the abusive men she had encountered recently. 

She kissed him on the cheek. "I know you can do it," she smiled reassuringly. 

The details of how it would be accomplished were driven from his mind. A beautiful woman, dressed in just a light summer dress, was holding him close. This was beyond his experience and he was unsure of what to do. 

"How am I going to get there? What if we get caught? The guards will be there and there's security cameras!" he exclaimed. 

The last thing Brooke needed was for this nerdy guy to wimp out on her. "You need to report back to your Uncle. That will make him think he has me where he wants me. He won't be expecting anything then." She pushed him away holding his hands. 

"You had better use that card, just to make it sound real on the phone," she said, affecting a demure expression. She looked up at him intently with head slightly down and to one side. She was trying to make him feel more assured but he just stood there. 

The signals were all there for him to make a play for her so she could tell him, 'not until the job is done.' He was responding to her but nothing doing. It occurred to her he was a virgin. She almost laughed at him. Instead she led him from the kitchen back to her bedroom. 

He meekly followed. She stood with head down so as not to show her amusement. The sun shone brightly through the dress illuminating her luscious body. This was more erotic for him than being naked. She could see his cock growing harder in his pants. 

She had already pushed too far. It would be humiliating for him to cum in his pants so she had to work quickly. There was no time for the demure girly act. She took a firm grip of his shoulders to guide him onto the bed. 

"Lift your hips," she told him. Pulling the jeans down to his knees she licked his thighs. Thankfully he still smelt of shower gel and spray. He must have doused himself and rushed over eager to meet the mystery woman. 

His cock throbbed against her cheek. There was no time for niceties. She sucked it into her mouth and only then realised how large it was. It was about the size of Carlene's strap on dildo she had so often sucked. 

Brooke was going to try the usual submissive act but thought better of it. She dare not look up at him with admiring girly eyes, as the slightest encouragement would set him off. She gripped the base of his cock tight to hold him back. He would be all the more grateful if she made him feel like a stud. 

William had gazed in admiration at the exotic silhouette through her dress. As though in a dream he had sat on the bed and watched her undo his trousers. For a moment he was in a panic for she would see his erection and this had always been hidden with embarrssment. Watching her toss back the long hair and lean into his crotch almost made him cum. 

He didn't want to spoil the moment by spurting into her face. He felt anxious wondering what to do. Brooke and her crowd had always been way out of reach to him. He couldn't believe she was holding his cock. He watched, so mesmerised by the image, he was unable to feel her licking his thighs. It was a wonderful creamy pale flickering tongue. 

He watched his cock hit her cheek and gasped. Was she going to do that wonderful thing to him? Surely not! He watched her lips form over its head and gasped out loud. The lips were light inside with perfect white teeth gently nudging it. He felt the wonderful soft plump lips grip the head of his cock. 

He felt elated and ashamed all at the same time. He wanted to tell her she didn't have to do this he would do anything for her, anything at all. Instead he watched his cock slide between those luscious dark lips. There was a hesitation, a tighter grip. His eyes widened in shock. 

Those wonderful lips kissed his crotch. Her chin was pressing against his balls. She had swallowed his cock entirely! He seemed to have lost touch with reality. It was as though he were watching a blue movie and it was happening to someone else. It was probably the only way he held on. 

Brandi felt him twitch, ready to cum. She didn't want to taste his sperm so pushed her head right down into his crotch. If he spurted now it would be past her tongue straight down her throat. She hesitated a moment but nothing happened. She assumed it was inexperience making him nervous, unable to cum. She didn't want that either. 

Her head bobbed up and down in a steady rhythm while gripping tight with her lips for plenty of suction. A hand delicately massaged his balls with the occasional scrape of a long fingernail. 

With her lips gripping the head of his penis she looked up at him through narrowed eyes. She moaned loudly for the reverberations to tingle his cock. It was time to pull out all the stops. 

With a loud sucking noise she let go of the cock to look up at him with a pained expression. "Cum for me, please. I need your cum, from this great big cock," she whispered hoarsely, while stroking its length and fondling his balls. She licked some fluid then with exaggerated delicacy kissed its eye. 

"Do you want to cum over me?" she asked sweetly. The expression of rapture on his face told her he was too far gone for an answer. She would just have to work on him. 

She sucked a ball into her mouth then licked up his cock. All the time her hand worked him hard. At last he was about to cum. 

William watched every move. He knew she was talking to him but couldn't concentrate on what she meant. The sensations were overpowering. He knew this was the moment he was going to cum. His back straightened, his legs stiffened, his cock thrust upward. 

He buried his cock in her mouth and the orgasm rocked him. Her mouth and throat gripped his cock tight but still he needed to reach further. He needed to enter her body to spurt his seed deep inside. 

His body slumped back on the bed. His breathing calmed from the deep gasps of a moment ago. He opened his eyes not seeing the ceiling yet seeing everything in sharp focus. It was the very first time with a woman. He hadn't imagined it like this. He thought it would be a quick fumble under the sheets in the dark. 

His mind raced over all that had happened since she had opened the door. There was no doubt in his mind now. What ever it took he would save her by rescuing her friend.  

===

Chapter 04 

The Rescue 

Brooke went over the arrangements yet again making William recite his part to perfection. Something was bound to go wrong but with luck they could improvise and rescue Carlene from that bastard uncle of his, Freddy. 

"We will succeed," William enthused. 

"Like I just did for you?" she quipped. 

"Eh?" 

"Never mind, just go I've got to get ready," she sighed. 

Brooke was in the shower washing off William's cum, thinking out loud. "Men are so thick when they're distracted by their penis. If only the uncle had been as pliable as his girlfriend, or William, Carlene wouldn't still be there and that bastard Freddy wouldn't have anything over me to keep me dancing around like his damn puppet." 

If she could have used her body to distract the guards at Freddy's house she would have tried it already. The damn place was more like a fortified compound than a home but William had found a way in. Later tonight might be their only chance to free Carlene. 

They had seduced and abused his girlfriend and breaking into his compound would add to Freddy's loss of face. Freeing her was only a part of the issue for he had contacts enough to find them and the retribution would be severe, if not deadly. 

*** 

Taking a deep breath she entered the club as ordered. Brooke wondered what ordeal she would be forced to endure next. The stupid blonde bimbo they had toyed with hadn't been worth this much trouble, though she did feel a tinge of excitement mixed with the apprehension over this new adventure. 

If her friend hadn't been held to ransom she just might have enjoyed the adventure; stepping into the unknown ready to obey a stranger. She too had limits, though not very clearly defined. She was no stranger to danger she lived for it and could cope with men or women, maybe turning them into accomplices to get her own way as she had William. 

Having to keep her wits about her she avoided the bar. She was black in an all white male dominated club which sent a shiver through her despite the earlier bravado. At least they weren't bottled up red necks. They were a tough looking crowd maybe criminals like William's uncle, though that didn't stop the men ogling her body. 

Brooke wore a white stretchy sheathe contoured to her curves, purposely exuding sex so as to seduce the next client. He could either be brought to heel or brought off quickly, it didn't matter which. A couple of heavyweight guys made a move on her reminding Brooke of that disgusting act around the Freddy's pool and she uncharacteristically froze. 

She couldn't get the image of those big hulks, taking her every hole while Freddy watched, leaving her shaking and afraid. This fear thing was something new and she didn't like it one bit. Before she could recover a third man appeared between them. He put a hand on the two big men, looking as though he were resting his hands on shelves not shoulders, and leaned in on Brooke. 

"You been sent over by Freddy?" he asked. 

The friendly wink calmed her a little. At the mention of the bastards name the two hard cases shied off, moving surprisingly nimbly for such large predatory beasts. 

"I'm the manager here," he explained. She glimpsed the blue card and sighed inwardly. The card meant she had to obey this man, unable to refuse whatever he wanted, while her friend was held prisoner at that damn compound by that bastard Freddy, William's uncle. 

Why did it have to be the manager? She could be there to serve behind the bar but didn't think so. After what she had done to Freddy's girlfriend this was going to be a punishment, she was going to be taught a lesson. She couldn't dance, couldn't hold a tune but anyone could lie back and take it. Brooke could cope with a private one on one performance but here in this club she might be expected to become the entertainment. 

Those two big brutes would be the least of her worries. This man could give her to anyone, maybe more than one. It had been made clear by that disgusting Freddy she was to obey absolutely whoever held the blue card or her friend would suffer. Freddy knew how to make a person suffer for brutality was his trade; he was a malicious gangster. 

She would have to make sure this guy didn't complain or her friend would suffer. She was fully aware of the dire position she was in but with William turning up she thought it might be easier than imagined. No such luck now. 

A big toothy smile failed to portray confidence rather it revealed anxiety and weakness. The nightmare was about to start after all, she was going to be that evil bastard Freddy's whore! 

She followed the manager through the club into his office all the time hoping to regain enough confidence to seduce him. It was imperative she pleased him, not just to save her friend a punishment but to save herself from the worst his imagination could conjure up. 

He waved a hand meaning for her to stand in front of the desk while he took a seat. He swivelled around examining her from head to toe. Her head hung low, avoiding looking at him, while trying to regain the usual charm. 

"Let's take a look at you then," he said, meaning for her to look up at him. 

"Yes, sir," she responded, knowing this was a time to play the submissive card. It would do no good cajoling him for he ran a seriously heavy club and had already shown how he could handle those heavies. So nervous was she his demand was interpreted as something more than for her to look at him. 

She peeled the hem of the tight white dress up her body, already revealing the outlines of a voluptuous figure, to expose a tiny thong. Peeling it higher she struggled to pull it off over her head it was so tight. She stood before him pulling at her hair, feeling very naked. Often she wore no underwear for the sheer devilment of it but this was different. 

He looked at her professionally assessing her assets, not revealing the slightest surprise at her mistake when she stripped off. "You must owe him a lot of money or some very big favour," he commented. "You're an amateur aren't you," he added, when she refused to answer. 

The amateur jibe she took to mean she was too shy to remove the underwear. The guy continued to appraise her body waiting her out. Relenting to his patience she unclipped the bra dropping it onto the floor with the dress. The thong was designed not to show under the figure hugging dress and it too was a struggle to remove. 

He stared at her large breasts then seemingly satisfied stared right between her legs at a neatly shaved pussy. The professionalism of that look meant there wasn't the slightest chance of seducing him for he was too used to handling scantily clad dancers, entertainers and probably whores too. 

The feeling of defeat was creeping over her despite the monumental effort at maintaining a last shred of confidence. 

He didn't need her to strip off for what she was going to do but he wasn't complaining. "So, do you know what you are here for?" he asked casually. 

"What, what ever you want me for, sir" she stammered, with a whisper of a voice. The pathetic sound of her own voice made her realise how nervous she was. Brooke tried to make it sound as though she was there for him and only him but knew he wasn't interested in the hired help. 

She was going to be used to entertain the customers. Who was she kidding she was there to fuck whoever he wanted her to fuck and they both knew it. She had played around like a naughty slut but to become this man's whore was devastating. She would have to pretend to enjoy it too just to get a good report with that bastard Freddy. One false move and Carlene would feel it from a whip or much worse. 

Anyone else would have burst into tears in abject sorrow by now but she had been in bad situations before and always turned them to her advantage. There was still some hope of getting out of this. 

"I have a special guest in tonight you will entertain. Make sure you please them as Freddy specifically told me to report on your behaviour," he started to say. 

'Why do men always want to lecture me,' she wondered. At least it looked as though it would be just the one, unless the client was perverse. Maybe he liked to watch others fuck her. The sudden thought of animals made her shiver. 

He took it as a sign of her inexperience, but before he could continue a knock sounded loud on the door. It swung open admitting a tall confident woman. She was dressed conservatively with an expensive set of pearls draped around her neck. The dress was designed exclusively for her confirming the look of class and money. 

Brooke looked down at the cheap screwed up nylon sheath that was her dress and almost laughed at the pathetic situation she was in. 

"Hmm, nice," the woman said. 

"Hi Dorothy, nice to see you, how are you, I'm fine. So that's the pleasantries over with shall we get down to business?" he asked, without her saying a word. 

"You know me too well, darling," she smiled grimly. "Is this it," she said, nodding toward Brooke. 

"Yes. I haven't had a chance to brief her yet," he said. 

"Debriefed her I see!" she chuckled, with a smokers rasp. "No need, I'll take charge of the little tramp," she said. 

"Get dressed," he said, sounding bored with them both. 

The woman was middle aged, a tough character, looking like a Disney villainess. Brooke was sure the woman had a long cigarette holder somewhere in the large bag she carried. Realising she had been spoken to she reached for her clothes. 

She was unfazed over being naked for she wore clothes to tease and loved exposing her body. The dress had curled up into itself looking ridiculously tiny now and would need stretching, with difficulty, back into shape just to cover the essentials. It was more than likely it would display some personal bits with every step. 

"Stay, girl," the woman demanded. "Here, put this on," she told Brooke. 

Brooke took the dog collar without a word of protest, gaining time to asses this new adversary, ready to winkle out the woman's weaknesses. She had played this sort of game with Carlene often enough and was relieved she was to be given to a woman. She reached for her clothes again. 

"Down, pet," Dorothy commanded and slapped a wrist with the leash. She clipped the leash to the collar. "I'll take it as it is, no need for adornments," the woman told him. 

"The door on the left takes you direct to the private rooms," the manager told Dorothy as she guided Brooke out. A sharp tug of the leash had Brooke walking close, either under control or choking. She chose to be an obedient pet until she could get the better of this woman. 

At the end of a corridor Dorothy stopped before a plain door. "Down, pet," the woman demanded. 

Brooke got onto all fours as she had some time ago with Carlene when playing this kind of game. It was obvious what was going to happen in that private room but Brooke was steeling herself to it, building a protective resistance. 

Crawling through on hands and knees the noise of conversations and background music burst over them. This wasn't a private room they were back in the club! The damn woman was parading her naked across the sticky carpet among all these men. She was showing off her cute little pet on a leash. 

The expected groping didn't occur as she crawled alongside her mistress to the bar. The men showed Dorothy respect, obviously knowing who she was, which gave Brooke something to think about. She would normally get hot over displaying her naked body but managed to restrain her lascivious thoughts. 

The time she had rigged a dress to fall off when Carlene tugged it, contriving to make it look like an accident, flashed through her mind but was quickly suppressed. These people were dangerous so she needed to keep her wits about her. Perhaps she was learning a lesson after all. 

The crowd standing at the bar parted. "My usual and the same for the pet," Dorothy ordered. "In an ashtray," she added 

Brooke was appalled. She was expected to lap the damn drink from a dirty ashtray on the floor. Carefully licking, avoiding a cigarette end and some ash, was not her idea of fun even though she had some weird ideas on how to behave. 

Leaning forward, ass up, gave everyone an intimate view of her shaved crotch. No one mentioned it, which meant they had a lot of respect for her mistress, but she could feel their eyes boring into her. The submissive role and alcohol was working on her exposed hole. 

"Enjoy your drink, pet?" Dorothy asked. 

Brooke looked up glaring at her. 

The woman reached down with a finger pushing at her sex. "Everyone looks very interested in this little hole but I'm sure they could use the others too. Nice tight asshole pet. Do you want me to give you to these men?" she asked. 

Brooke looked up at her mistress with imploring eyes. Before she could speak she spat out a cigarette end. "Please mistress, keep me just for you, please!" she whispered back. 

"Be a good little pet and do as you are told then," she demanded. 

"Yes mistress, thank you mistress," Brooke replied. Inwardly she groaned knowing her usual protective sassiness had been deflated leaving her submissive side to take over. She often submersed herself in the role with Carlene but it was safe with her friend but with this woman it left her so terribly vulnerable. The more she gave in the more submissive she became and the woman obviously knew how to take advantage of it. 

Brooke was naked in an exclusive club full of men with the morals of the gutter, dependent on the protection of this dominating harridan. It was no wonder she felt defeated and totally obedient, unable to use her usual guile to get out of trouble. She was in a real mess now, without the prospect of her friends help. 

Obediently she padded on all fours through the club led by her mistress. On the way they met a young guy also with a pet on the end of a leash. "Be a good pet and smell its ass," her mistress commanded. 

The other pet girl did the same to Brooke, not that she minded at all, in fact by now she was ready to be licked and wiggled her ass at the older woman. 

"Kiss its ass pet," she laughed. 

As humiliating as it was, in a room full of strangers, it must have been more so for an older woman to be kissing her young black asshole. The woman hadn't known anything about her but it was now obvious she was turned on by this lewd and humiliating display. 

"That's enough! You're enjoying it far too much you're like bitches on heat. Now French kiss her to clean your mouth you dirty little slut," her mistress demanded. Pulling the leash she manoeuvred her pet around so they were face to face. 

Brooke gulped and froze. She recognised the woman! She was a policewoman! How could that be possible? The look on the cops face didn't show the slightest recognition, rather her eyes were full of lust, enjoying every moment of this dire humiliation. 

She wasn't just a street cop either, she had some high rank, yet here she was being led around naked in a club full of criminals by a young guy. Hell! The woman moved in and all Brooke could do was open her mouth letting the cop explore her tongue. Pressing mouths close they opened up with big wet slobbering kisses, wrapping tongues around in a swirling fight, exploring each others mouths. 

"That's enough!" Dorothy commanded and pulled hard on the leash. "Your pet is a right little slut, mine too by the look of things," she added with delight. 

"She's frustrated, hasn't had her full dose of cock yet," the young guy told Dorothy. "I'm going to see to her then leave her to the customers for extra fucking," he added. 

Dorothy looked at the two of them in disgust. Pulling on the leash she led Brooke away without another word to the horrible young man. So it seemed even she had standards. "Come along pet, you might catch something from the dirty bitch," she warned Brooke in an exaggerated tone of dismissal aimed at the young man. 

In a private room Dorothy pulled off the expensive dress and dumped it on the floor without a thought to its value. It was an unconscious display of wealth. She made herself comfortable on a pile of cushions, opened her legs and crooked a finger at Brooke who crawled toward her. "Lets see what you can do pet, pleasure your mistress," she smirked. 

Brooke was in familiar territory now, no longer out of her depth, able to dive in deeper than this woman expected. Her new mistress wore no panties so there was little to do but practise an art she and Carlene had mastered. 

She tenderly kissed and stroked both thighs hoping to keep the woman off guard as though she might be shy. Licking them now she made her way toward the bare pussy, just the way she liked them. She licked wetly with a long strong tongue at the crease beside a pair of swelling lips, occasionally nudging the lips with her nose. 

As though a novice she tenderly kissed the now bulging wet lips then suddenly sucked everything into her mouth and nibbled boldly. The muscular tongue reached in among the open folds of her cunt teasing the woman's bud. The pressure of the strong suction was increased and Brooke knew it how it would feel; as though she were being pulled inside out. 

It was obviously a tremendous arousal for Dorothy for she started squirming and lifted her hips to have her cunt worshiped by her new pet. Her head rocked back opening her mouth to gargle a string of words. "Yes! Eat me pet. Lovely pet, oh! Yes! You fucking slut, do it, make your mistress cum, you bitch pet," she croaked. 

Fortunately the woman didn't clamp her thighs around Brooke's head allowing her some freedom to stretch up and pinch the woman's nipples and massage her breasts. She moved up to massaging her body while the woman came round from the deep orgasm. Bending over her mouth she was going to deep kiss her. 

"No pet, not after kissing that sluts asshole," she warned. "You did so well I'm going to keep you as my live-in pet. I want more, so much more," she crooned. "I'll arrange with the manager to take you home. I'll pay him a great deal to make you my suck slave," she sighed. 

Brooke was both flattered and angry at the idea of this woman buying her. She took no notice and leaned in while the woman struggled to push her off only to find her wrists caught in restraints. They were strategically placed around the floor under the cushions but Brooke had found one then another while bringing her victim under control during the orgasm. 

Dorothy tried to bite her but Brooke was younger, stronger and faster. She had played this game too often with Carlene to be caught out. 

"No you bitch, stop it, let me go! You'll be punished for this," she threatened. 

Brooke rocked back on her haunches breathing heavily, only now getting her breath back after diving in the woman's flabby wet hole. 

"My husband will punish you badly pet if I ask him. You wouldn't like that one little bit, he's a vindictive bastard at the best of times," she said, with a look of disgust on her face. 

"The men out there respect you, because of him?" she asked. A nod confirmed it. "Who is he then?" she asked. Hoping a powerful husband might be able to help in the fight against Freddy. 

"Its easy to find out, just ask anyone here," she said, with a dangerous glare. "Loosen me right now and I'll punish you instead of giving you to him to deal with," she added. 

Brooke looked in one of the cupboards and found a big rubber dildo. She licked it seductively and rubbed it between the woman's thighs that were now held wide by two more restraints fastened to the floor. 

"So who is he then?" she asked, moving the big black dildo closer to the woman's cunt. She wasn't afraid at all and just smiled. 

"You won't know him sweet lamb but to his friends, correction accomplices in crime, he is simply known as Freddy," she stated. "What's the matter pet? Damn! You're one of his tramps and he set me up with you!" she said, suddenly looking angry and very mean.  

===

"No! Maybe! I don't know. I'm being punished by him!" Brooke spat at her. 

For no good reason, except she had a captive audience and needed to talk, she told the woman the whole sorry tale from beginning to end. Dorothy didn't interrupt but took everything in. 

"Well! You are in the shit that's for sure and so is your friend! When he gets bored with the game you will both probably disappear, for good," she observed. "You seduced his secretary come girlfriend!" she laughed. "He doesn't have much luck with women does he? You might as well let me go now, I'm not going to add to your problems," she said. 

"Could you help us, please, mistress!" Brooke said, attempting to gain some sympathy from the woman. "I'll be your little suck toy for ever if you do," Brooke whined like a wind up doll, trying to be appealing. 

"As much as I like the idea there's no way I'll get involved, not with him, though there is someone who might help. They can easily be forced to help," Dorothy added, looking deep in thought. "Wait here," she told her. 

Brooke sat rocking back and forth, more worried for her friend than ever. She was desperate for help otherwise she wouldn't have said anything to that damn woman. 

Dorothy walked back in trailing the pet on a leash they had seen earlier. "You recognised her didn't you, don't lie, I saw it in your face. She's a trainer at the police academe, don't worry your secret is safe with me," she said to the cop. 

The policewoman was still naked on hands and knees and looked up suddenly with a look of abject dread plastered across her face. 

Reluctantly Brooke repeated the events to the cop. The naked party pet sat with Brooke and Dorothy listening to the tale of woe. She became a cop again asking questions, clarifying points, which was almost ludicrous for all she wore, was a collar and leash. Dorothy added a few details about the compound while they hashed over what might be a solution. 

"What about you?" Brooke asked the cop. 

"I don't want out of here if that's what you mean. Just don't ever mention you've ever met me, OK?" the naked cop said firmly. 

They turned toward Dorothy. "I'll be pleased to get him out of the way, I might even move back into the house. I'm still married to the bastard and he owes me big time," she stated, with a flash of anger in her eyes. 

Dorothy argued with the manager but eventually managed to whisk away both women. 

The cop wouldn't tell either of them her name but promised to carry through the arrangements. "Good luck with your friend. I'll be there right on time so don't fuck up or you'll be in trouble big time," she warned and walked briskly to her apartment. 

"She's taking one hell of a chance playing around in that club," Brooke said. 

"It's best never to mention it to anyone, not even to your friend. If those guys in there find out who she is, well you can imagine," Dorothy said, with a shiver of disgust. 

Dorothy had used the club dungeon for a light teasing fun but if they took the cop down there she would never see the light of day again. Those sadistic fiends wouldn't just tease her they would use the equipment to painfully torture the poor twisted woman. 

Dorothy dropped Brooke off at her apartment. "You actually live here?" she asked. "Well, good luck and let me know what happens. Just fix that bastard up and I'll owe you big time little pet," he said with a big smile. 

Brooke didn't hang around she ran up the stairs and almost bumped into William sitting on the dark stars outside the apartment. "Come on, its time to do it!" she said through gritted teeth. 

He tamely followed her into the bedroom. "You OK? Feeling scared?" she said, while peeling off the dress yet again. This time she wore no underwear having got dressed quickly to leave the club. 

If he had been ready to back out before, his eyes now revealed he would follow her anywhere. She bent over to grab a t-shirt and jeans from a dirty pile of clothes on the floor, ready to pull them on. Instead she turned to him sensing the troops needed a morale boost, something to stiffen them up. 

"I'm so vey grateful Will, you know that don't you?" she said, moving in for a big hug. 

He couldn't say anything. He wrapped his arms around her carful not to touch anything too delicate. 

She pulled his hands over her bottom. "Hold me tight Will, I need your strength, need you to be my big strong hero," she whispered into his ear. 

"Yes, Brooke, I'll do anything for you, honest," he whispered back. 

"You can't go around like that you'll be too distracted," she said and grabbed his cock to explain what she meant. Brooke loved teasing men but usually had no intention of giving them what they wanted. She meant what she had said but he was shy and inexperienced, so it had to be handled right. 

"It's my fault I've turned you on, prancing around like this, I was just too eager to get going. I should have thought about you more. Shall I do something about it for you? I don't want you making a mistake because you're thinking about it, you know?" she said, while trying to sound and look demure. 

"No! I'll be OK. I won't let you down," he blustered. 

His innocence and honesty got to her again, besides, he was vital to the plan. 

"You're so sweet, Will," she said. Brooke wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him deeply. Pushing her pelvis up against his cock she decided to take his virginity. 

She slid down his body onto her knees and loosened his jeans pulling them off. He shook with passion thinking she was going to blow him again. A million misgivings went through his mind, wondering if he was up to it. She guided his feet out of both jeans and underwear. 

Grabbing his hands she pulled him onto the bed where he fell next to her. "I need a big strong man to take me and calm my nerves," she said and meant it. "Make me yours, Will, make love to me," she encouraged. Not daring to touch his cock in case she set him off she just hoped he wouldn't let himself down. Not because of her need but for the sake of his self-esteem. 

He needed some encouragement to roll on top of her. With no experience his full weight was on her but she liked it, loved to be dominated and crushed into the bed. Snaking a hand between them she guided his rock hard cock, rubbing it over her already wet lips. 

"It's so big! Don't hurt me Will, please. Take me gently, don't rush me," she whispered. 

He was far too close and too eager to hear what she said but something of the message worked through to his brain, preventing him from going at her like a rabid rabbit. She guided his hips upward then pulled strongly, forcing him to pierce her body deep. She opened her legs and slammed them around his hips needing to absorb all of him. 

She had been teased to the point of torture all day and needed a good fucking. His nerves from being the first time kept him back from a quick orgasm which was just as well for both of them. 

They sweated, breathing heavily, settling into a steady rhythm, enjoying the animal lust dulling rational thought, sinking into a primal motion with throaty grunts emphasising every thrust. 

William cum first, unaware of anything, least of all that of a gentleman's protocol. 

Unusually she felt every spurt of sperm, every spasm of his cock, following every one of them with delightful ripples through her stomach. Brooke had been reduced to a vagina with nothing else existing in her world. There was nothing in her mind but pleasure from a big cock filling her up. 

They lay sated in a heap of sweaty flesh no longer two individuals but one organism made whole by a mutual primitive pleasure. 

Brooke recovered first. "Hell! You fucked me good, fuck, that was good," she whispered with a hoarse throat. She figured she must have been yelling but the neighbours were used to that, not that she cared about it. 

"Hold me. Kiss my nipples, gently their sore," she said. 

"No! Leave that alone, you've beaten it so much all ready," she scolded him. 

"I didn't hurt you did I?" he asked. 

"No!" she laughed. "Don't look at me like that, you're too intense," she added. 

He rested his head on her breasts looking up at her. "Will you talk to me when we go to college?" he asked. 

"What? Of course I will fool," she laughed. "You're no longer a nerdy boy you're a sex machine. I'll go right up to you in class and give you big sloppy kiss you idiot," she said. Seeing the look of honest pleasure on his face she couldn't help teasing him. "Then I'll crawl under your desk and blow you, just so everyone knows I belong to you," she teased. 

"It's time!" she announced. 

"Again?" he asked. 

"No you fuck machine! Its time to go, lets get to business," she said, wrestling away from him. 

Brooke found some underwear from the same heap of clothes abandoned on the floor and started to pull it on while he watched. 

"Hey! Get moving sex machine. No! There would have been time for a shower if you hadn't been such a big long fucker, besides we'll be crawling along a drainage ditch so it won't matter," she cajoled him. Pulling up the jeans she was relieved to see he was eager to get on with the job. 

*** 

"Yes, your right. This is a good place to hide the car," she confirmed. Brooke wasn't used to stealth, she preferred to blunder in then bluster her way out of trouble. "Pity there's no trees between here and the house," she mused. 

"No trees therefore no twigs to snap underfoot, just soft grass all the way up to the wall. No lights this side either," he told her. "Tools," he replied, to the enquiring look. 

They made a dash from the trees at a half crouch, expecting at any moment to be challenged but made it undetected. The house looked impressive from the inside, where guests were received, but it wasn't as well protected as it was made out to be. 

"It may be all show but this wall looks daunting enough for me," Brooke whispered. 

"Along here, follow me," he said. 

A well concealed grill at the foot of the wall was given away by a ditch running out across the sloping ground. Anyone seeing the ditch would be led right up to the wall and scrubby bushes concealing the wire mesh. 

William pruned the bush back with is mothers gardening shears giving better access. He had a tool kit with him but a steady shove revealed it hadn't been put back properly from all those years ago when he slipped out that way. He lowered it carefully to the ground. 

Brooke was more nervous than he was but then it was only his uncle but her gangster pimp. Carlene had warned if she carried on so blatantly defying convention Brooke would end up a whore and she had been right. Not from choice though, that bastard had forced her into it to protect her friend. 

That's why they were there, she reminded herself, to save her friend from the bastard. She just hoped he hadn't hurt her. 

"You can follow me and let me know if my ass looks cute in these jeans," she quipped, but the humour had drained from her voice. 

They crawled through the narrow opening, thankful it was dry. 

"He must have installed a circulation pump to stop the overflow," William said. 

"Eh? Shut up, you're being a nerdy boy," she scolded him. 

They stifled giggles threatening to erupt from the building tension. 

Overhead the moon shone through a grill of bars. Over her shoulder she whispered. "We're fucked!" 

He crawled over her body, biting a nipple on the way. He pushed at the bars and the whole thing crept up an inch. "Push!" he told her. 

"That's what I told to you earlier," she giggled, but heaved at the grill with him. 

He pulled a screwdriver from the roll of tools and propped it up just enough for her to squeeze through. She held it for him all the while scanning the pool area. He was through and laid it quietly away from the opening. 

"Come on!" he whispered. 

Brooke remained stooped staring across the pool. She saw herself tied to a chair being abused by three big men in black suits. She hadn't seen their eyes behind the shades making them anonymous strangers taking her. 

"Bastards!" she swore. 

Brooke took a hold of his shoulder and turned him toward the front gates. "When you see me with her unlock the gate then run over here to help. If you hear loads of noise, do the same. Just don't look back, run for it. Do you hear me?" she warned him. 

"Why unlock the gate? Were not using it," he asked, in confusion. 

"I'm no good at all this shit. Forgot to tell you there's a bigger plan going down. Just do it. Did I tell you you're a great lay?" she said. 

"You need me to help find her," he said, feeling left out. 

"Someone told me this afternoon. I know where she is," Brooke said and gave him a shove. She hoped her friend wasn't being forced to entertain the bastard in his lair; otherwise all this was for nothing. 

She crept around the pool toward the house peering into the shadows hoping not to find a bodyguard lurking there. Dorothy said the night shift always slept on duty but that was while she was living there, some time ago. 

The bastard had kicked her out on finding she was a lesbian with a penchant for pet-girls. He couldn't chop his wife while being watched closely by the police. He wanted to do the job himself so bided his time; he was vengeful but patient with it. 

Slipping into the shadows Brooke waited while her eyes adjusted and looked for the doorway to the guest rooms. 

A heavy hand clasped her mouth with another wrapping tight around her body. The scream was muffled but she kicked backwards finding nothing. The big guy had leaned forward knowing what to expect. Her soft shoes wouldn't have damaged him in the slightest. 

"You forgot about the cameras," he said into an ear. "I'm surprised to see you back so soon. Stop that it's unfriendly," he told her when she tried to slam her head back into his face. "Settle down, I'm not going to hurt you, but if you make a noise others will," he warned. 

Brooke didn't believe him. He was one of the big black suits that abused her roughly by the pool. Being dressed in shorts and t-shirt didn't disguise the fact. 

"You're going in the wrong direction for your friend," he said. He let her go and grabbed a wrist while she adjusted to what he was saying. 

She reluctantly followed trying desperately to work out what the hell was going on. He was going to lock her up with Carlene that much was clear but why hadn't he called the others. Shit! It was obvious he intended to have his way with them both. Perhaps that was to their advantage. 

The big man walked into the room without knocking. 

"Steve! What's up?" Carlene asked, while rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Brooke peeked around him at her friend. "Brooke! What are you doing here?" 

"Been playing around without me then?" she asked. 

"No, nothing like that, Steve's been protecting me," Carlene said, still hardly believing it wasn't a dream. 

"I'm here to get you out," she said, looking up at Steve, wondering what had been going on. 

"You should think twice about that. He will find you both and then you'll be sorry," he said, sounding concerned. 

"Let me worry about that!" she said, still whispering as they all were. Carlene looked at her not believing she was there and obviously convinced he was right. "I've made arrangements, Freddy's going to be taken care of, we need to get out of here," Brooke hissed at her friend and looked at her watch. 

"What kind of arrangements. Is the cavalry going to storm the fort? Or is you're little boyfriend out there going to scare the shit out of the boss?" he said, while shaking his head as though in sympathy. 

Brooke looked at her watch again. Steve didn't miss it this time either. "You have called the cavalry! It can't be the police or he would have been tipped off and be waiting for you to show up. Is it the Feds? Shit! I'm going too! What's the plan?" 

They crept into the next room and Steve manhandled the secretary out of bed. She didn't utter a word. Having spent two days haunted by what might happen when Freddy got around to punishing her she had broken down, unable to function. The two girls guided her out to the pool like a zombie between them. 

"I'll not fit down there!" he sighed. He had turned off the security system and joined them at the hole in the wall. William had been ready to take on the hulk until the girls calmed him down. "I'll walk out the front door and join you in the woods," he told them. 

He replaced the grill so as to put the Feds off their track and ran to the gate, sure that his lazy colleagues were fast asleep. 

*** 

"Shit! We'll never fit in that thing!" Steve cursed. 

"It's a Beatle, very reliable, a sixties icon!" Brooke defended it sharply. 

They jostled around eventually figuring it out. The secretary was squeezed in the back on top of William sitting next to Carlene. The secretary was quiet having resigned herself to be going for the final ride into oblivion. 

"Look after her Will. She's in shock," Brooke whispered to him. 

Steve took the driving seat looking like a big kid in a toy car, with Brooke beside him emphasising the image. Without lights they crawled along a makeshift track between the trees. Steve figured someone, police or others, had flattened the grass driving in to spy on the house. 

"Stop here," Brooke stated loudly. They were on the edge of the woods still concealed by trees. Each of them could hear the heavy breathing and tom-tom drum beats of hearts pounding. 

"This is more excitement than I've had in a long time," Steve announced. He wished he hadn't given up smoking. Lights appeared in the distance then went out. The cowardly man in the moon had ran and hidden behind some clouds. Three cars and a truck passed by silently, apart from the sound of tyres kicking up loose stones on the dirt track up to the house. 

There was only one place they were going, and that was up to the house. Each of them held their breaths for a silent vigil, revealing the uneven ticking of the engine. 

Counting to twenty then repeating the process, Brooke announced, "Go quietly and slowly. Don't fucking panic!" she shouted, sounding as though she already had. 

The car eased out onto the dirt track and coasted down it to the concrete road. Turning onto that they made off into the city not knowing where to go, just relieved to be making a progressive distance away from trouble.
