 Falling in Love with my Best Friend 

 Love...it comes when you least expect it. 

 At twenty-five and after a never ending fiasco of one failed relationship after another with men, I decided to swear off them for a while. I didn't realize at the time it meant forever, but that definitely ended up being the case. 

 My life at the time I met Janie probably was pretty mundane in retrospect. I was finishing off school, I went out with friends to dance, went to the gym, and took photos of everything. 

 Everyone has addictions. Mine are photography and shoes. When I'm depressed I go shoe shopping; when I'm happy I go shoe shopping; when I'm bored I go shoe shopping. I have over 50 pairs of shoes and heels in my closet...many I never have the right occasion to wear. 

 I also love nature. When I'm stressed, I put on my hiking boots and go for a long hike. There is nothing better for putting life into perspective than being one with nature. Away from the noisy, overcrowded, pretentious city life, one can quickly remember what life is really about...something that is easy to forget when working in the deadline based, fast paced world of the city. 

 Mom always said the best way to a man's heart is through his stomach (though I've learned it's actually through his penis and a willingness to blow him every time he gets the urge, quite frankly...if you don't, some other skank will), and I have always been an amazing cook. I love to create new recipes and experiment. 

 I'm pretty average when it comes to women my age; I don't mean that in a negative way, just a matter of fact sort of way. I mean, I'm cute in a Sandra Bullock kind of way, but not model sexy like most young actresses nowadays. I'm 5'7, 149 pounds (and determined to never hit 150), 34B breasts (not too big, not too small), hazel eyes, brunette shoulder length hair, with nice toned legs, a firm ass and pretty toes. 

 Anyways, enough background about me. This is the story of how I accidentally became a lesbian and found the love of my life. 

 I was just finishing up my last semester towardsmy degree in Business Administration. I decided to look for a part time job, something to occupy my time, and found one as a hostess at a café named Coffee Palace. 

 It was close to home, and I immediately felt comfortable, particularly because of one of the baristas, Janie. 

 Now it wasn't like I fell in love with her the minute I met her, that is way too Hollywood chick flick. But there was an unexplainable, undeniable pull towards her. It could have been her warm personality, her charming smile or her laissez faire attitude towards life (she loved every day the way I tried but failed miserably to do). 

 She trained me, and the more we chatted, the more we realized we had a lot in common, even though she was 31 and had a young niece, Cindy, whom she had adopted when a crazy situation arose. We both loved shopping (although I suppose that's true for most woman), both loved working out and staying in shape, and we both loved nature. 

 While I was a shy woman, uncomfortable in front of large groups, she was a people person who easily mingled with all cliques of people. She was a social butterfly I was a wallflower...yet we became almost inseparable. 

 We went shopping together, we started working out together and I even took her to my secret place of solitude, something I had never done with anyone. 

 Over the next couple of months, I also babysat little Cindy on a few occasions when Janie needed a babysitter. I began to take any opportunity possible to spend time with Janie. I would almost always come over2 or 3 hours before she was planning to leave and we would talk and I noticed she was often giving me very flattering compliments. It felt like she was hitting on me, yet she would never go any further than compliments or squeezing my arm. I would giggle like a school girl. Loving the attention and hinting I wanted more...even though those feelings confused me greatly. 

 We got into a fun routine where she would model her dresses for me and ask me to pick the one that made her look sexy. After the first couple of times doing this, I noticed I was getting wet and thought 'can this be? Am I getting turned on by this?' But on those occasions, I quickly pushed the thought out of my head as silly and just a symptom of sexual withdrawal, with no man in my current life or on the near horizons. 

 Then came my birthday on April 17th. I have never been a big birthday person, so I thought Janie had no idea it was my birthday when she called me and pleaded I come over right away and babysit as something had come up and she needed to leave ASAP. 

 Of course, I agreed. 

 When I got there, Janie hollered, "Come up to my bedroom, Holly." 

 I had been in her room many times as already mentioned, helping her choose her outfits when she went out...Janie being an avid clubber, something I wasn't a big fan of. I had gone out with her a few times, but usually I would babysit instead and use the late evenings to study so this wasn't out of the ordinary. 

 I had seen Janie in only a bra and panties, sometimes pantyhose or thigh high stockings, but never completely naked...until now. 

 I walked into her bedroom and she was completely naked sitting on the edge of the bed putting on a second nylon stocking. As I looked closer, I noticed that besides being topless, she also wasn't wearing any panties. 

 She finished putting the stocking on, stood up, ran over and pulled me into a big hug as she greeted me all excited, "Happy birthday, Holly." 

 I got a full face of her boobs and suddenly I panicked. Although I definitely had feelings for her, the sudden intimate act, which wasn't overly intimate, just Janie being Janie, startled me and I pushed her away and darted from the room, stammering, "I-I-I'll be downstairs." 

 My mind was spinning as I sat downstairs. If I hadn't pushed her away, what might have happened? Why was my pussy suddenly tingling with desire? I definitely found Janie attractive, but coming from a very conservative home, being a lesbian was a definite no-no. 

 Janie came down the stairs dressed and apologized, "I'm so sorry, Holly. I thought I read the signs better. I wanted to give you a birthday to remember." 

 Flustered and uncomfortable talking about it, I said, "Please, I don't want to talk about it." 

 

 "Okay," Janie nodded, a look of hurt and guilt on her face. She went to the kitchen and returned with a wrapped present, "Here's your real present." 

 "Y-y-you didn't have to," I stammered. 

 "You've become my new best friend, Holly," she explained. "Although I'm a little annoyed you didn't tell me it was your birthday." 

 "How did you find out?" I asked. 

 "Facebook," she answered. "I saw your many birthday wishes from family." 

 "Oh," was all I could say. 

 "Why didn't you tell me?" She asked, as she handed me the gift. 

 "I hate to make a big deal about it," I answered. 

 "You're a big deal to me," Janie smiled. 

 I laughed, before asking, suddenly very curious, "Sooooo, what did you get me?" 

 "Open it and find out," she answered. 

 I unwrapped the box and was shocked to see a new camera. I gasped, "Janie, this is too much." 

 "Nonsense," she said, waving a hand. "The amount of free babysitting you do for me, I imagine I owe you a lot more than that. Plus, you can't put a price on friendship." 

 "Thank you," I said, tears beginning to stream down my eyes. 

 "Come get a non-naked hug," Janie smiled, her charming smile breaking down the brief awkwardness of earlier. 

 I learned that Cindy was actually staying overnight at Janie's mom's for the night, and tonight was my surprise birthday celebration. 

 Janie sent me upstairs to get into something a little more sexy than my t-shirt and jeans and then we headed out for a late dinner and even later movie. 

 All night, I couldn't believe how lucky I was to have her. I also began questioning whether I had made the right decision to push her away when that intimate moment occurred. 

 Was I bi? 

 I was definitely curious. 

 Could I have a sexual relationship with another woman? 

 What would happen if it didn't go well? I couldn't fathom Janie not in my life anymore. 

 What would my parents say if I brought a woman home? 

 Yet, I was never happier than when I was with Janie. That was definitely true. 

 Over the next month, Janie never brought up that day and stopped flirting with me completely. There is that saying 'you don't know what you've got until it's gone' and that was definitely true in this case. I missed Janie's teasing sexual innuendo, I missed her gentle touches. I continually replayed that brief moment when her naked body touched me and almost nightly my bedtime routine included masturbating to that moment but with a much different ending. 

 My feelings confusing me, I went online. I did some research and eventually ended up finding a site called Literotica. I began reading lesbian stories and found myself imagining me being the protagonist in many of them. I came across an author, silkstockingslover, and after reading a few of her stories and getting turned on majorly, I came across a story called 'Bedding the Babysitter'. That story and its many sequels changed my life. 

 I imagined I was the young babysitter, Jenny, and that Megan, the seductress of the story, was Janie. I couldn't stop pleasuring myself and frantically fingered my fevered cunt until all my pent up sexual frustration exploded out of me when I reached orgasm. 

 I kept reading and reading the entire story series and wishing that was me and Janie; I realized that I was submissive through this story; I loved pleasing people in all aspects of my life including in the bedroom; I wanted Janie to dominate and make love to me as happened to Jenny by both Megan and, later, a cheerleader named Karen. 

 I came to grips that I likely was a lesbian, or at least leaning that way, as I no longer found guys attractive and I had been hit on many times while working at the coffee shop as well at school while finishing up my degree. I wanted to be with Janie, but I wasn't sure how to say so after I had rejected her so harshly. 

 I emailed silkstockingslover to thank her for the great stories, especially 'Bedding the Babysitter' and we began an online friendship. I won't get into the many emails we shared, but I told her my predicament and asked for advice. Being the kind-hearted woman she was, she gave me advice and I decided to make a move. 

 But first I received my degree and started a new job working as a secretary and thus had to quit working at the coffee place, making it more challenging to follow silkstockingslover's suggestions. 

 Determined to show Janie how I felt, I decided to make my move. 

 I asked her to meet for supper and she said sure. 

 We met at The Southside Diner and once we ordered I said, "I need to tell you something." 

 I was incredibly nervous and my heart felt like it might beat out of my chest. 

 She could tell something was up as she asked, "Are you okay?" 

 I took a deep breath and blurted, "I'm sorry about my birthday. I have regretted it ever since. I don't know why I pushed you away, as I am pretty sure I am in love with you. I wish I could turn back time and redo that event. Can we, can we have a redo?" 

 As I looked into her eyes, I saw tears forming and before I could say anything else she excused herself and hurried to the washroom. 

 I watched her walk away, my heart sinking into my stomach as I realized I had probably just fucked up our friendship. 

 I decided I needed an answer and needed to apologize for putting her in such a situation. I walked into the washroom and saw her standing in front of the mirror wiping tears from her face. I asked, trying to be a friend and not a lover to be, "Is everything okay?" 

 She turned around, smiled, walked to me and pulled me into a hug before kissing me. 

 My whole body became jelly from her touch and I knew, without a doubt, all my insecurities and questions about my sexuality were answered, as this was the best feeling I had ever felt. 

 When she broke the kiss, I started babbling. "I'm such a noodle head for not embracing my feelings for you. I just couldn't understand my own feelings and was overwhelmed and confused." 

 "I love you," she interrupted my babbling. 

 I felt like the luckiest girl in the world when I heard those words said to me. 

 

 I stammered back, in utter awe of the situation, "I-I-I love you too." 

 After another kiss, the washroom door opened and we made our way back to the table. We finished eating in silence, both our heads spinning with our new revelation. 

 Once dinner was done, I went to pay and when I returned we headed to the parking lot, each of us having brought our own cars. She said, as we stood in front of my car, "I have to go home, I only have a babysitter until nine, but we need to continue this conversation." 

 "I couldn't agree more," I nodded, wanting to feel her lips on mine again. 

 She leaned forward and kissed me. To my surprise, this time there was a very unique taste on her lips. When she broke the kiss, she smiled, "Just a slight sampling until we can be more intimate." 

 I looked at her confused, not really understanding what she was saying. 

 She smiled, "You really are an innocent lesbian virgin, aren't you?" 

 "But I'm a quick learner," I retorted. 

 "An eager beaver?" She questioned, raising her eyebrow. 

 "The eagerest," I replied, not even sure that was a word. 

 "Do you know why I always wear skirts?" She asked. 

 "To showcase your amazing legs," I answered. 

 "Well, that too, obviously," she nodded, before glancing around before moving her hand under her skirt. 

 I watched in awe as she apparently fingered herself. 

 Pulling her finger back out, she moved it to my lips. I automatically opened them, now realizing what I had tasted on her lips as she explained, "For easy access to my pussy." 

 I actually moaned on her finger from the naughty implication, the sample taste adding another piece of evidence that I was definitely a lesbian. I sucked on her finger like it was a cock until she pulled out and nodded, "Oh, I think you will be a very eager beaver." 

 My face went beet red at how eager I was to please. I wanted to kiss her again, I wanted to suck on her breasts and now I wanted to taste her sweet nectar directly from the source. 

 "Soon, Holly, very, very soon," Janie promised, before kissing me again and leaving me standing there, my panties soaked. 

 A few agonizing days later, our work schedules just not matching up, we ended up at the movies to see Lucy, although truth be told I have no idea what happened in most of the movie. 

 We went to a night showing at 9:45 so there were only a few people in the theater with us. We sat in the back and for the trailers we seemed to be playing a game of teasing chess: our hands would brush against each other getting popcorn; I would glance at her slyly, I sensed her glancing at me; we grabbed for the coke we decided to share at the same time. 

 Once the movie started though, my desire to show her my interest, to hold her hand, took control and I took the risk of putting my hand on her nylon-clad leg. 

 She whispered, "About time," and grabbed my hand and moved it to her thigh where her stocking ended. She continued, "Thigh highs make for better access, too." 

 "So I see," I whispered back, giddy with excitement, no longer watching the movie as I imagined creating my own. 

 She continued moving my hand until it reached her rather damp panties. She whispered, "She how wet you've already made me." 

 I couldn't believe I was touching her pussy through her panties. 

 She offered, "Go ahead, Holly." 

 I briefly wondered if she meant for me to drop to my knees and move between her legs. Part of me wanted to, but the thought of getting caught in such a compromising position held me back from my carnal desires. Instead, I moved my finger inside her panties and began to tease her clit. 

 "God, yes," she moaned, which excited me. I continued exploring her pussy, wishing I could see what I was doing or could see clearly the look on her face. Yet, her whispered words were all the encouragement I needed. "That's it, Holly, slide a finger inside me, please, baby." 

 I needed no more encouragement. I quickly obliged her suggestion, sliding one finger deep inside her wetness. I finger-fucked her slowly, in awe of what I was doing to the woman I loved, in a movie theatre. 

 After a couple of minutes, she moaned, "Pull down your jeans, baby, I want to do you too." 

 My pussy on fire, I reluctantly pulled my finger out of her pussy and quickly unbuttoned my jeans and awkwardly tugged them down. 

 She whispered, "You should have worn a skirt, baby." 

 "I'll never make that mistake againnnnnnn," I replied, as her hand went directly to my panty-covered pussy. 

 As her hand moved underneath my soiled panties, she asked, "Did I get your panties this wet?" 

 "Always," I moaned and twitched, as her finger made direct contact with my swollen clit. 

 As she moved her finger up and down between my pussy lips, she suggested, "Let's finger fuck each other, baby." 

 "Kkkkkkkkk," I trembled, as her finger slipped slyly inside my heated pussy. 

 I awkwardly moved my hand back between her legs and slid my finger back in and we started a lengthy journey of teasing each other as the movie played. She returned her gaze to the movie and I did the same. My eyes watched the movie, yet my brain processed nothing. All I could think about was her finger in my pussy and my finger in hers. I wanted to make her come, I wanted her to make me come, yet I replicated her pacing...which was slow...teasing...mind numbingly teasing. 

 

 The pleasure was intense, constant, but just enough to create a lustful desire for eruption. Suddenly, Janie whispered, "I need to go to the washroom." 

 Before I could respond, she was gone. I sat there for about five minutes wondering if she simply had to go pee or if I had done something wrong. Being in a new type of relationship, especially one where I still didn't completely trust my own feelings, was confusing at times. Yet, in the heat of the moment, it had felt completely natural: touching her and being touched by her. 

 My own insecurities were running rampant when Janie returned, leaned in and whispered, "Sorry, but your fingers were driving me mad, I had to go and finish myself off so I didn't scream I was coming in the middle of the theatre." 

 "Oh, God," I said, both turned on and relieved. "I thought I had done something wrong." 

 "God, no, you did everything so fucking right," she purred, tugging on my ear with her lips. 

 My body quivered, my ear being one of my erogenous triggers. 

 "I also got you a little present," she whispered, her tongue teasing my ear. 

 "What?" I asked, barely able to speak even one word. 

 "Open your hand," she ordered. 

 I mindlessly obeyed, knowing I would do anything she asked me. 

 As she tugged on my ear, I felt something wet in my hand. She whispered, "This is how wet you made me, baby." 

 After one more tug, she moved back to her chair. I was holding her soiled panties in my hand. I instantly felt a gush in my own panties and stammered, standing up as I urgently tugged up my jeans, "I-I-I have to go." 

 I scurried out and went directly to the washroom. As soon as I got in the stall, I tugged my jeans down and began frantically rubbing myself. Getting close, I pulled her wet panties out of my jean pocket and put them to my nose, wanting to smell her scent. That was all it took and my orgasm rushed out of me as I screamed, "Fuuuuuuck," not caring if anyone else was in the washroom.  

 

 

===

Once my orgasm was completed, I pulled my jeans off, took off my excessively wet panties, put on her equally wet panties, and returned to the movie. 

 Sitting back down beside her, I whispered in her ear, "God, you drive me wild." 

 She winked, "Oh, I haven't even began to drive you wild." 

 I put my panties in her hand and added, "My gift to you." 

 She took them and brought them to her nose, "Mmmmmmmmm," before she moved her mouth to the wet crotch and sucked on them. Instantly I wondered why I hadn't thought of that. She whispered, a moment later, "I'm looking forward to tasting you directly from the source next time." 

 She leaned in and we started kissing like teenagers. Our tongues exploring every crevice of the other's mouth, no longer caring if anyone saw. 

 We didn't even notice the movie end, but the lights started coming back on and we realized that the theatre was empty, which meant every person had walked right past us making out. 

 Janie quipped, "At least I wasn't buried between your legs." 

 My face went beet red at the image. Feeling sexy and a little risqué I joked, "But you should be." 

 She winked, as she grabbed my hand, "All in good time, baby." 

 We walked out together hand in hand, two lesbians in love. I didn't care if anyone gave us looks, although I didn't notice anyone judging us. 

 She dropped me off, my pussy still on fire, and she smiled sweetly, "Holly, I really enjoyed our evening." 

 "Me too," I nodded. 

 "I did mean everything I said, Holly," she smiled tenderly, "I do love you." 

 "And I love you, too," I concurred, looking into her eyes. 

 She leaned in and kissed me again. Breaking the kiss (she always broke the kiss), she finished, "I'm really looking forward to some more intimate time together with you." 

 "Me too," I nodded, feeling like a teenager again, already wondering when the next time was going to be. 

 A couple of days later, I received a text from Janie: 

 Be at my place at 7. 

 I texted back I'd be there and after work I changed into something sexier, a skirt, blouse and thigh high stockings I had purchased the day after the theatre incident. I also grabbed a box of strawberries, an idea from a porn video I'd watched a couple of weeks earlier popping into my head. 

 I got to her house ten minutes before seven and Janie opened the door before I could even knock, startling me. She greeted me, dressed in a robe, "You really are an eager beaver." 

 I countered, "You opened the door before I even knocked, so who's the eager beaver?" 

 "Touché," she shrugged, before adding with a sexy, sly smile, "fine, we are both eager to see beaver." 

 As usual, my face burned red instantly at the sexual innuendo, even though she couldn't have been more accurate. 

 Looking at the strawberries in my hand, she suggested, "Go put them in the fridge sweetheart, I was just getting ready." 

 I did as instructed and waited in the living room, again giddy with anticipation of the moment I had been fantasizing about for a while...in vivid detail the past two nights, although unsure if we were going out somewhere...I hoped not. I wanted to make love to her entire body; I wanted to taste her pussy; I wanted to be her everything. 

 Seconds seemed like minutes and minutes like hours until Janie called out, "Holly, can you come and help me with something in my bedroom." 

 The line sounded like something out of a bad porn movie, but I was hoping this was the invitation I imagined it was. I walked to her room, and after a brief pause outside the door, walked in and gasped. Sitting on the edge of the bed, in a tight blouse, black leather skirt, red thigh high stockings and black five inch heels, was Janie. 

 My heart skipped a beat as I stared at the beautiful woman I was in love with. My head flashed back to the disaster that was the first time I saw her in her bedroom like this, deciding this time the ending would be completely different...I was writing my own happy ending. 

 "Come here," Janie instructed softly, as she slightly opened her legs. 

 I walked to her, my mind in a haze of lust. 

 Reaching her, she grabbed me and pulled me in for a kiss...a kiss that lasted forever, as we again got lost in the intimacy of the kiss. Our tongues danced, our hands roamed and our breathing increased until Janie ordered, "On your knees, baby." 

 I didn't hesitate. I had read a ton of stories on Literotica and although we hadn't labelled this, Janie was undoubtedly in charge and I was the submissive. I was babysitter Jenny and she the sweet Mistress Megan, as my own 'Bedding the Babysitter' story happened live. 

 She crossed her left leg over her right and ordered, "Take off my heel, sweetheart." 

 My hand trembled slightly, as I moved and took off her heel. 

 She slowly uncrossed and re-crossed her legs, a scene directly out of 'Basic Instinct', giving me just a glimpse between her legs. 

 I watched the whole scene in slow motion as my mouth began to water at the inevitable conclusion to a long journey of self-discovery. I took off the other heel and then instinctively moved and put her nylon-clad toes in my mouth. 

 "Mmmmm," she moaned, "that feels nice." 

 I took my time, pleasuring each toe individually, wanting to make love to her entire body. I splattered the top of her foot, her ankle and back down to her sole with kisses. Once done, she uncrossed and re-crossed her legs so I could replicate the attention on her other foot. 

 Once done, I began moving up her legs, continuing the focused concentration until she ordered, "Baby, come and undress me." 

 I stood up, looking her directly in the eye as I began unbuttoning her blouse. Once it was all undone, I leaned in and began kissing her chest, above her breasts, as I slowly took the blouse off. She shivered a bit at my touch, but moaned, "Oh yes, Holly, that feels so goooooood." 

 I splattered her shoulders and arms with kisses, before taking each finger in my mouth and swirling my tongue around them like they were thin cocks. 

 She suddenly stood up and I unzipped her skirt and let it drop to the floor. Looking down, I saw she was wearing my panties. 

 "Do you like my panties, Holly?" She asked demurely. 

 "They look a lot better on you," I quipped back. 

 "They'll look a lot better on the floor, actually," she countered, before adding, "but first, why don't you get out of your clothes too?" 

 Feeling sultry and sexy, I unbuttoned my blouse and once it was off I tossed it at her. Then I pulled down my skirt and she commented, "Thigh high stockings, a very good choice." 

 "I wanted to make sure you had easy access," I smiled, as I slowly slid my panties down my legs. 

 "And the bra, too," she ordered. 

 I obeyed, now standing only in thigh high stockings. I asked, "The stockings?" 

 "Leave them on," she ordered, as she unclasped her bra and tossed it to me. 

 I don't know why, but I put the bra to my nose and smelt it. Of course, the only real scent was a faint lingering perfume. 

 "Come get your panties," she purred. 

 I went to her and slowly pulled her (my?) panties down her legs, the whole time staring at her completely shaved, slightly glistening pussy. 

 She said, "That wetness is because of you, honey." 

 "Mine is equally wet," I admitted, as she pulled me up and pushed my head to her breasts. I licked and sucked on her nipples, going back and forth giving each equal attention while cupping them in my hands. 

 "Go ahead, sweetheart, go lower," she purred. 

 Again I just kept obeying her suggestions, this time slithering my tongue between her breasts, swirling around her belly button and then reaching her pink wetness. I stared at it briefly, wanting to burn the image of her perfect pink pussy in my mind forever before I leaned forward, extended my tongue and finally got to taste Janie. The taste was completely unexplainable: sweet, yet tart, and yet the moment the taste hit me I knew I was addicted. Having read lots of lesbian stores (I highly recommend Suburban Submission by Dave933 or Soccer Mom by Couture) and having watched lots of lesbian porn (I highly suggest Hot and Mean from Brazzers), I thought I knew what I was doing...yet as I licked I immediately understood that only from real experience and not literature or videos was I ever going to know how to pleasure a woman. Instead, I explored. I licked between her pussy lips, I swirled my tongue around her clit and I awkwardly plunged my tongue in her pussy hole. Her moans implied I was giving her pleasure and when she grabbed my head and held me tight into her pussy I knew she was close. I sucked her clit between my lips while simultaneously flicking it with my tongue and soon I was rewarded with her full flood of pussy juice. It flowed out of her and into me as if she was giving me a gift, and in reality she was. 

 I continued lapping up her pussy juices until she let go of my head. She complimented, "I think you're a natural." 

 "It felt natural," I replied, as I felt her wetness all over my face which somehow turned me on even more. 

 "I think it's time to take you to heaven," she said, standing up. 

 "I'm already there, worshipping my goddess," I countered, sounding corny, I knew. 

 "You really are an eager beaver," she smirked, as she went to her dresser drawer. 

 "I've always been eager to please," I replied, which was true whether it be in the bedroom or just in life. 

 "Lie down on the bed, it's time to be rewarded for your desire to please," she said, as she pulled out a white vibrator. 

 I quickly got on the bed, realizing my knees were kind of sore, and lay down ready to be pleasured by my beautiful girlfriend. Was she my girlfriend? God, I hoped so. 

 Joining me on the bed, she turned it on and moved it to my breasts, something that had never occurred to me to do to myself in my many hours of self- pleasure. She teased me relentlessly, moving the vibrating toy around my nipples, between my breasts and then directly on my nipples. 

 It was driving me nuts, my pussy on fire and wanting that toy inside me. She asked, "Do you want me to fuck you, baby?" 

 "God, yes," I replied, thankful she could read my mind. 

 "Beg, sexy," she purred, as she flicked my nipple with her tongue. 

 "Oh, please, Janie, fuck me, fuck me now," I pleaded, never really good at dirty talk. 

 "I think we'll have to work on your dirty talk," she smiled and gave me a wink, as she moved the vibrator between my legs, which I instinctively opened wide. 

 She moved it up and down between my pussy lips, continuing to tease me relentlessly, before sliding it deep inside me. 

 "Yessssssss," I screamed and trembled, my orgasm rising in seconds. 

 "You look so hot, Holly," she whispered, as I watched her lean down and begin licking my pussy while she fucked me. 

 "I lovvvvve you," I declared, for the world to hear it was so loud, as my orgasm got closer and closer. 

 She pumped my pussy with the toy, while simultaneously sucking on my clit and in less than a minute, which made me feel like a man, I came hard. "Shiiit, I'm sorrrrrrrry." 

 She laughed as she continued the double pleasure and licked up my pussy juice. 

 The vibrator still in me, she straddled me and said, "I hope you can have multiple orgasms, because this night has just started." 

 I moaned, as she continued licking me, "I'm the energizer bunnnnnny," before I leaned up and licked her pussy again. Twenty minutes later, both of us reached second orgasms before she rolled off me, moved on top of me and kissed me...both of us tasting our own pussy juices. 

 Breaking the kiss, she declared, staring into my eyes, "I love you, Holly." 

 "I love you too, Janie," I replied back, knowing I would I do anything for this woman. 

 That night, I also met her strap-on cock and ate pussy in her shower. 

 Two months later, I moved in with her and last weekend she met my parents as I came out to them. I'm not sure my father approved at first (actually, I know he didn't), but Janie, was just Janie, and by the end of the weekend she had both my parents in love with her. 

 Today is our three month anniversary since we declared our love for each other in a bathroom and I can't imagine being with anyone else. 

 Love...it comes when you least expect it. 

 P.S.: Of course, the morning after our first night together I had breakfast in bed...literally, when I ate strawberries out of Janie's pussy...a tradition we have continued every weekend since.
