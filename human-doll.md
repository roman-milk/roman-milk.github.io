Human Doll

"What have you done to me?" Rose squeaked, in a long out-breath. Her voice sounded like a windup dolls as though a string had been pulled from her back. "What have you done to me?" she squeaked again, confirming the impression a string had been pulled. 

It wasn't her voice that worried her it was the body she had woken up with. She was a young attractive woman with a super ego to match, or at least she had been a few days ago. 

A continuous recording had played through earphones a carefully built scenario over the past few days, while she was unconscious. A cocktail of drugs had been given to keep her unconscious and to leave her mind susceptible to the voice re-building her self-image. 

Bill wasn't sure it would work as there were bound to be bugs in the system this first time it was tried. Her reaction on waking seemed to confirm some success. He picked her because she had been particularly annoying. The future of the project depended on a decision from her to continue funding. She had been unimpressed with the profitability figures despite the project being a benefit to accident victims. 

The program had been quickly modified for her with the aim of teaching her how disastrous it was to loose control of bodily functions. The drugs and equipment were designed to teach the brain to quickly re-learn to walk after brain damage. 

There was nothing wrong with her physically or mentally but she thought there was and would continue to until he set her free by reversing the program. A couple of hours should do it. 

She struggled to sit up so he naturally helped her. Sitting on the high tech bed she looked stiff and awkward as though it was difficult to control her limbs. 

"What have you don't to me?" she repeated, with a plaintive tone in the doll like voice. 

Bill wondered what she was seeing, how she was seeing herself. The program had been quickly cobbled together and there had been no time to adjust it to her personality. It had been continuous too rather than a series of short sessions. 

He had been angry from the supercilious manner in which she had dismissed the project without even knowing how important it was to patients. So it wouldn't make a profit immediately. Long term it had tremendous potential and he was going to teach her that the hard way. A couple of hours should do it then another hour undoing what had been done to her. 

"What do you think I've done to you?" he asked. 

"You bastard, I'll sue you for every penny you have for this!" she squeaked. Her face screwed up with pain, not from any physical problem, because the mental image she had was so very difficult to take. 

He was used to teasing out from patients how they felt and what they could feel of their limbs but this explosion of viciousness was unfamiliar. He looked at her seeing a self-important business woman too busy to bother with little details. She was too busy to consider minor details like helping people to lead normal lives again. 

He stood looking into her blue eyes. His big brown eyes held sympathy and understanding but she couldn't see that. She kept staring at her legs and held her arms out from her body as though they were dirty, contaminated with something nasty. 

"My body, my beautiful body, you've taken it away. I don't want this plastic dolls body, I want my human body back," she squeaked out plaintively. 

So it was confirmed, that was what she could see. The recording didn't just over-write the mind it shaped it toward accepting the damage and to give strength to overcome the disability. Accepting a prosthetic limb and helping the mind to relearn to control that limb, was the true program but this quick change was turning out rather strangely. 

"What have you done with my body? I want it back now!" she demanded, only the silly squeaky noise denied it any authority. The more forcefully she commanded compliance the more comical it became. 

He kept a straight face. "If this isn't you're body whose then?" he asked. 

"It's a doll or a manikin, one of your plastic bodies for patients. You know what you've done to me! It's hideous. Do something and quickly," she demanded, with the same outrage. 

So that was it. She had completely misread the reports on the project just as he had thought. He watched her examining both hands, the movements awkward, with fascination and a touch of horror. He had intended for her to awake thinking she had been subjected to the project but not to this extent. Her own imagination had worked with the suggestion and programming to build this bizarre scene. 

He nearly reacted with a belly laugh. The stupid bitch thought he had replaced her entire body. Impossible! She had no idea what he was doing here yet she took the decision to cut funding. His lifetimes work slashed by a short sighted accountant. 

"What is wrong with it, don't you like it?" he asked, with the intention of provoking her. Her mouth worked around words that couldn't catch up with what she wanted to say. "I thought you might like a superior body to see how vital my work is. That body will last longer than yours and won't grow old. I will help you learn to control it and I'm sure you will find it an excellent replacement," he lied. 

She looked stunned, unable to speak once more. For a moment he wondered why she wasn't crying for she looked as though she wanted to. Of course! She thought she couldn't, so won't cry. A relief, for he would have given in immediately. As it was he wanted to carry on the joke a little longer. 

"Here, let me help you down, you should get dressed," he suggested. 

He swung her legs round to the edge of the bed. She sat there a moment with a look of worry creasing her brow. 

"No, I can't, it doesn't matter," she murmured. 

"What?" he asked, sounding solicitous, as he really did have to know what she was thinking, for when he put things right. 

"It doesn't matter if it is better or longer lasting I need my body back," she squeaked, no longer sounding so sure of herself. 

"I'm not sure I still have it," he teased. The look on her face revealed such pain it was obviously more than just a tease to her. 

"Why? What have you done with it?" she moaned. The voice sounded very funny now. 

"It has been put up for sale. It was in fine working order so rich people were interested in it," he said. Lifting a tiny mobile 'info grab' to his face he spoke into it. "Where is female body 367?" He looked at the screen that displayed a shopping list. "This is the one. A rich client has purchased it for a Miss Fortune," he said. "She hasn't been in an accident. She is thirty-two so everything is probably in working order. It doesn't say what she is doing with her body so you could have that one," he said with a slight smile, meant to placate her. 

"How could you do that?" she squeaked, in an even higher octave. 

"It will pay for a few months research. After all, you, cut the budget so I have to find the funds somewhere else," he scolded her. 

"This woman has it? What does she do?" Rose asked, in a pleading tone. 

"In the entertainment industry," he began. 

"Oh! No! Miss Fortune! Entertainment industry? She might be a stripper, using my body, showing it off to strangers. Shit! She might be a whore! Please don't tell me she is out there using my body!" she pleaded. 

He looked at the little device as though consulting it, giving him time to get a grip on the laughter boiling up inside. "No. She hasn't taken delivery yet," he told her. "Here let me help you onto your feet. Take it easy you'll have to learn to walk," he said. 

She wasn't worried about being completely naked before him as it wasn't her body she was revealing just a plastic dolls. 

He stood her up holding onto her as she wobbled around on unstable legs. He was used to patients but this was different. He was suddenly aware of how attractive she was. She had large breasts over a slim waist with long tapering legs. Slim thighs and thin ankles made them seem so long, so enticing. 

She was a natural blond too. He wondered how she saw herself, whether she still had female parts or the smooth crotch of a storefront manikin. He didn't feel comfortable asking or touching her to see how she reacted. 

Rose figured it would be best to regain full control of this body in case she needed it. It was also imperative she gained his confidence and co-operation for no-one else knew how to put her back into her own body. At that thought she gave a little shudder and would have sobbed if she could. 

It would be nice to have a life sized doll like this to play with. He would soon teach her she had a vagina and how to use it. He quickly shut off the thought. He was beginning to harden and that would be dangerous. There was only so far he could go with this game and going too far would be perilous to the project. So far what had been done to her mind could be undone. 

Instead of the usual meticulous procedures in teaching someone to control their coordination he simply took a hold of her hands leading her around the laboratory. Of course she knew how to walk for it was still her body, she just thought it wasn't. For a moment he fooled himself starting to fall into the usual routine. 

They paused a moment with his arm around her slim waist. She looked into a long mirror and gasped. "It's so, so, real looking," she said. The squeaky voice was prominent, almost emphasised. "My features are very nearly the same. I have all the bits down there," she said. 

Getting used to the voice he recognised embarrassment. She may only be looking at a plastic manikin but she was inside it and it was naked. 

"Are the breasts bigger?" she asked. 

He looked at her pretending to study the manikin body knowing it was hers and that everything was very real and very feminine. He looked again, studying her breasts and waist. Was it an optical illusion from having lost weight? The drip was just meant to keep her hydrated so she would have lost some weight, yet her breasts did look bigger. 

"I'm not sure," he said, as though commenting on an experiment. "I haven't seen your previous body," he lied. 

She could tell he was lying. He must have undressed her and prepared her body for someone else. She studied the doll in the mirror and decided the breasts were bigger as well as the waist being slimmer. He wasn't showing much interest in the new enhanced body, probably from being too used to seeing them. That was a pity for she could have used it to influence him, after all it was just a doll she could control, so why not use it to capture his co-operation. 

In the mirror she took a good look at him and noticed a stirring in his trousers. Unless he kept pygmy ferrets down there he was interested so she had a chance after all. 

Leaning over the bed she pressed the thighs together feeling the lips of the doll's pussy squeezed between them. She looked over her shoulder at him. Angling her head in what she hoped was a submissive pose. She looked through long eyelashes at him. "I might be able to get used to this body. Does it work like mine?" she asked, trying to sound coy. 

"What do you mean?" he asked, only half listening for he was looking intently at her bottom. 

"It's embarrassing, I mean," she tried, but couldn't continue for it really was embarrassing. She looked away, closing her eyes, before trying again. "Am I a woman? No, I mean physically am I a woman, can I feel everything properly," she asked, in a whisper. 

He explained a few improvised pseudo technical details which she didn't understand but guessed at. It would serve the purpose if she could entice him to try it. Had he tried the body before she had occupied it? If so the doll was all the more interesting with her inside it. She hoped. 

"Could you do me a big favour? Show me. Show me I'm not just a big dolly, that I'm still a woman. Please, would you do that for me?" she pleaded. 

It sounded like a windup doll asking for a tummy rub. That gave him an idea. He would ask her to be more specific. Forcing her to ask him for intercourse would be so humiliating for her. When the whole situation was revealed to be just a game she would be too embarrassed to tell anyone. He couldn't go so far as to take her though. 

He studied her ass, seeing how hard and tight the cheeks were. They were separated to reveal a little asshole. Below that were the lips protruding rudely between slim thighs. They were glistening too. 

"You could put me back and offer this body to that woman. You said it's stronger so she could use it more than a human body, couldn't she?" Rose said, with a sense of purpose in her voice. "Try it, see if it works," she said, trying to sound neutral, as though it didn't really matter what they did to a doll's body. It wasn't real, it wasn't her, it was just a doll, she rationalised. 

She closed her eyes, hearing his shoes squeak on the clean tiled floor as he took a couple of steps closer. Even if he wasn't interested in a plastic doll he might be scientifically curious. She would try her hardest to be seductive despite this distinct disadvantage of not having a living breathing body. 

She felt his arms circle around her waist as though testing the idea it was slimmer. His hands went up to her breasts and cupped them, weighing them. Was this scientific interest or just a man taking a hold of her big tits? 

She reminded herself sharply they weren't hers they were just a plastic dolls, so it didn't matter what he did with these artificial lumps. It was a relief to remember he was the only one in this project so there wasn't a spotty apprentice touching up her real body in the laboratory next door. The thought of some stranger taking advantage of her body while it was helpless in storage somewhere, heated her up. Her breathing rate increased. 

What if that woman was a whore and she obtained the use of her body? Perhaps it was her pimp purchasing a younger body to please the punters. The woman wouldn't care what was done to a purchased body so it could be worn out by over use; too many men with too many strange fetishes. Once passed its youthful flush it might be passed on to an older more desperate whore with even less moral reticence. The dolls breathing became ragged. 

A terrible image came to mind, of colleagues finding her in a whorehouse. She might be in a private apartment where the most despicable tricks could be performed. They would find it a grand amusement abusing the office ice maiden. They wouldn't be able to resist taking her, making her perform the most disgusting and debased acts imaginable. The doll gasped a deep intake of breath. 

All those men she had snubbed, treated with disdain, could take revenge on her body for the whore wouldn't care as long as they paid. An innocent kiss at a party or too tight a squeeze on the dance floor had been denounced. Now they could have her performing like a brazen hussy, like the whore she would be. 

Friend's husbands could spank her bare bottom or dress her up in fetish wear. Single colleagues could take her out on the town dressed as a cheap whore, knowing how particular she was with her clothes. It would be a singularly fitting revenge for someone who was conservative in their dress sense, to wear a micro mini skirt and see through blouse. The doll exhaled a deep breath of outrage yet becoming more inflamed. 

Bill had one hand on a breast squeezing it and tweaking a nipple. The other hand drifted over her bottom grazing the fine down then alighted on pubic hairs with the lightest of touches. Finger tips stretched toward her lips then backed off to concentrate on inner thighs. 

She pressed her bottom against him and found his penis, liberated from his trousers moments before. On finding it she pushed her bottom against it devilishly gripping it with both cheeks. She went on tiptoe to manoeuvre herself onto it but couldn't lift high enough. In frustration she rubbed her bottom up and down its length trying to enrage his passion, needing him to just take her. 

"Do it, just do it," she moaned. 

His fingers skated over her lips avoiding delving in, avoiding her searching thrusts. He moved his fingers away when she tried to move herself onto them. "Tell me what you want," he whispered in her ear, saying it on a heavy breath of air blown into an ear. 

"Do me, please, just do me," she croaked. 

"Do you mean the doll?" he asked. 

"Yes! Fuck the doll, fuck the whore doll, please! Please fuck the whore doll, fuck it now!" Rose whined, sounding as though the string had knots in it. 

He pushed her forward gripping her hips with both hands. His hard cock rubbed between her cheeks as she was stretched over. She kept her legs straight brazenly presenting her sex to him. In her mind she used the excuse it was just a plastic dolls sex she was offering. 

He slid his cock forward toward her open wet sex hole. The head slid across her wet lips lubricating it, not that it was needed as she gaped for him as though gasping for air. She wriggled her hips then her thighs trying to entice him in as well as capture the teasing cock. 

"Please!" she implored. 

"Please, what?" he mocked. 

She didn't care. Desperation overcame reticence and even moral values. Was she controlling a doll or was it controlling her. The thought appeared then quickly fled. "Please fuck your doll, fuck the doll, drill it, cock it, please," she yelped, in gasps. 

He drove his cock in intending to bury it but she anticipated the stroke and gripped it hard as it entered her. She squeezed hard gripping it wanting to feel it all not wanting to lose it. He pulled back feeling the grip loosen then plunged in, all the way his cock penetrated her vagina stretching it filling her up with cock. He pulled back pushing on her hips. 

"More! Fuck me harder! Fuck your whore doll hard, use your fuck doll, please. Please sir, more fucking harder!" she exclaimed, in one rush of an out-breath through an open mouth. Her nostrils flexed and flared with air sucked and blown through them. She ground her teeth pushed back onto his cock when he thrust in and followed it when he pulled back. 

"Tell me what you want," he stirred her. He was still in control and marvelled at the way she let loose. It was impressive how sexed up she had become. She shook her head and rolled her eyes. In a mirror he could see the contorted expression of anger on her face and how hard she gripped her nipples. The thought that he shouldn't be doing this was lost sometime ago. 

Her legs began to tremble and she hissed through clenched teeth. "Keep still! Please don't move." 

At that moment he began to orgasm. Knowing she was orgasmic had set him off. He had to thrust forward with every muscle available in a desperate primeval need to drive deep inside her body, to reach her womb with his seed. He held her balancing on tiptoe with a slight prodding movement confirming he was as deep as possible. 

Rose collapsed into the mattress with his weight holding her down, not that she had the strength to rise. Her whole body felt complete as though it had been filled by his seed. A large smile lit her face. She was a happy contended doll.

Rose had been in shock the whole weekend; not getting up till late and then just wandering around the house in a daze unable to answer the phone not wanting to see or talk to anyone. Forcing down some toast she retched on the idea that an android couldn't eat, for it reminded her too clearly of how she had felt. 

He had apologised profusely explaining it was all in her mind and she hadn't been turned into an android at all. It had been so real! 

His project was to use android prosthetic limbs for those lost in an accident. The clever part was using drugs and hypnosis to implant into the mind acceptance of these new limbs. She had awoken in hi slab thinking he replaced her whole body with that of an androids. His program had brain washed her into accepting the idea and it felt so real. 

She tried to become angry over what he had done to her but it wasn't possible. Instead she was confused over the feelings engendered by the experience in that lab. He had taken her but she couldn't even complain about that for she had offered up her body to him. 

At first she pretended it was because she thought it was an androids body she was offering, but they both knew this was nonsense. It took the whole weekend to acknowledge being turned on while acting as an android. She had been treated like a doll and even now the thought of it was arousing. Rose wanted to cast aside all moral restrictions, to be free. Free to do anything however wickedly sexual it might be. 

After agonising thoughts she worked out it would be better to let someone be in control telling her what to do, removing all responsibilities for a short time. It would let her loose from a moral chastity belt a strict upbringing had fastened tightly around her mind and body. Something had happened, while she thought she was an android, which enhanced the sex a hundred fold. This last piece of the puzzle eluded her but she would discover what it was, without doubt. 

In the office she wondered how stupid she had been to be fooled by that man. It now seemed ludicrous to think of herself as an android so all she wanted to do was forget about it. Just put it behind her and get on with business and the rest of her life. It was never going to happen again.

"I've seen your report, Rose. I didn't think you could be affected by the emotional content of a business. No! In this case that's good. I agree with you, the project will make money once the system has been approved by the authorities. It's long term of course, but it's good to be linked to a worth while cause. You made a good decision there," Guy complimented her. 

"Thank you Guy. You've looked at the figures? The company can benefit from an association with such a worth while product but I'll have to feed it to the press to scoop the good publicity," Rose said and smiled back at him. 

"That's not what I dropped in to talk about. You've been off form this week. On past performance you deserve a break and perhaps its time to take it. I won't take no for an answer. Just do it!" he smiled. 

Why wasn't she heartened by the smile? It was too damn predatory. Was he making room for someone else? She had plenty of contacts but if out of the way for awhile he could move a protégé in. 

"Damn! I do need a break from this cut throat business and this organisations infighting," she sighed, after the door silently closed behind the boss. She would take it easy and look for a get-away vacation. There was a masked ball at Daphne's this weekend so that would be a welcome distraction. 

Rose took a long lunch shopping for an outfit to wear for the weekend. Pulling absently another from a rack she read the description without thinking about it too much. Her stomach muscles tightened. She felt sick and dizzy. Rather than put it back she determined to overcome the fear. "I'm a strong sensible woman, not some stupid air brained girl," she whispered. 

In the changing room she dare not look in the mirror. It was a tight fit but the costume was on and her breathing had returned to normal. The problem like any other could be conquered with patience and perseverance. Rose stepped out of the changing room and nearly fell. 

The heels were so high they left her feet pointing straight down. The dress had a built in corset tightened under the ribs making it difficult to breath. There wasn't much of a top to it either but that was expected from a Barbie doll outfit. If she fluffed up her hair and dyed it blonde she had the perfect look to go with the outfit. 

The mirror didn't lie. She wasn't an android but a doll. With a mask at the ball she could get away with it. Rose stood there staring at the image finding it worked as well as the time in the lab as an android. An android, or doll, either seemed to work on her subconscious. This was a start to finding out what had been triggered inside her in that damn laboratory. 

Some loud young guys walked in shouting some football slogans. They were teasing one of them about getting married. They were obviously looking for a theme for a stag night. Rose turned and tottered in the wrong direction, nearly falling. 

"Here, careful, you might hurt yourself," a young man said as he grabbed an arm. Rose recognised them as stockbrokers from the same company just a floor below her office. They didn't seem to recognise her though, which was a small comfort. 

Instead of wobbling back to the dressing room she was being led around the store and couldn't seem to get her breath to complain. 

"Look at his beauty, do you think we could bring her along as part of the fun?" the young man said to his friends. They dropped the bags to gather close about her leaving her feeling dominated; nearly swooning from all the maleness swamping her senses. 

She was about to tell the lower class boys to clear off. She wouldn't call them ruffians because they earned so much but they were certainly not of her calibre. Couldn't they see she was top floor management? Catching sight of the outfit in a mirror elicited a slight groan. 

She was dressed as a Barbie doll and a rather racy one at that. Her breasts were too big for the outfit which clung to her body, and was working its way between the cheeks of her bottom. She dare not look at what was happening between her legs. 

"We've a conference room booked with plenty of booze and entertainment. Do you think you could take us all on? Just the four of us I mean. A thousand pounds! Just say yes doll," he enthused. 

Somehow she found herself agreeing with a nod, still unable to speak. Their presence was so over whelming or was it something else, that dark side inside her? 

They had been drinking before this and the pure energy pulsed from every pore. That's how they worked in the office making deals and she had heard they played hard too. What they meant she hardly knew but couldn't refuse as she was dragged along by their enthusiasm. 

Something about being called a doll was working on her too. At least he was guiding her in the right direction, back to the dressing room. 

"A quick one before the others get stuck in, a doll?" he said. 

Again he called her a doll and fear or something else was wrenching at her stomach, her innards seemed to turn to water, leaving her weak. Without his help she slid to the floor, at last free of the punishing shoes. He didn't seem to be helping rather he was pushing her onto her knees. 

She looked up ready to tell him to leave and she would follow later. All that couldn't be said with a look so a deep breath was needed. The corset pushed against her ribs crushing the intended words. She opened her mouth wide and he slipped in. 

His cock was in her mouth! A gurgled cry of anguish was all she managed but there was little breath to shout anything. His cock hit the back of her throat and she choked. He grabbed her hair to use it for leverage and rocked back and forth in her mouth. 

She clamped it tight inadvertently gripping his cock in a tighter embrace enhancing his feeling of fucking a tight pussy. The gargling sounds of anger vibrated up his shaft adding to the experience. She could feel he was close to orgasm and started to panic. 

She pulled her head back almost freeing her mouth but he pushed forward, still gripping her hair, and again she pulled back. At least his cock was no longer down her throat but she definitely didn't want him to cum in her mouth. A mighty pull and she was free, his cock bounced in front of her face where she was tempted to bite it. 

It spurted great clots of off white sperm. It splashed into her face, mouth and nose then dribbled over the outfit. Rose sat back on her haunches in shock. The nasty cock was right there in front of her. He wiped it across her face and she went for it like a dog after a snake. 

She only managed to touch its tip with her lips a couple of times as he wiggled it around in front of her as though it were a game. She gave up trying to bite it as he was enjoying the game too much, thinking she was trying to kiss it. 

She slumped back onto her thighs, feeling used and beaten. "Here is half now the rest later. See you in the Smith conference room as soon as you get cleaned up. The guys will be waiting for you. Don't blow them as good as you did me or I'll be jealous," he warned her in mocking tones. 

She pulled the outfit off almost ripping it from her body. "Damn!" she whispered over and over. It was now absolutely clear what he meant. He thought she was a whore and this money was payment to entertain his friends. She was expected to attend their drinking session and blow them too. "Damn! Bastards!" she exclaimed. 

There was no way she could chance running into them over there even if she sneaked up to the top floor of the office building, it was too risky. They were all too high to be discreet and even if they were sober they would brag to their friends about what had happened, what she had done. 

She couldn't take the chance of being recognised by them and being talked about. She could hear the awful whispers buzzing around in her mind. "He had the whore doll blow him. That self important bitch from upstairs plays at being a whore doll." 

She wiped her face with the outfit and screwed it up angrily, throwing it in a heap on the floor. The outfit couldn't be put back after being splashed with cum so she folded it carefully and paid for it at the counter. Fortunately the young guy was oblivious of the despicable act she had performed. 

She hurried back to her car and sped home where she could cry a flood of tears. "Come on Rose you stupid bitch, don't let them get to you," she shouted out loud. Her hand went down between her legs for she couldn't resist one second more. 

Screeching to a halt in a side road she leaned back in the seat with thighs spread furiously rubbing the crotch of her panties. Impatiently scratching them to one side she found her swollen nub and plucked at it in haste, desperate to cum. 

The terrible ordeal in the cubicle where she was dressed as a lurid pink Barbie doll became an intense fantasy. She was that young mans doll ready to perform anything for him. Unable to resist anything, committed to obeying him like a good little dolly she revelled in the squalid act. 

Feeling bad and naughty, but above all engulfed in an intense sexual arousal, she frigged herself with passion. She quickly brought herself off. Slumping forward in the seat she twitched, breathing heavily from a desultory orgasm. It was some small relief but not enough. 

A knock on the side window rocked her back to reality. She looked around looking startled, wondering where she was. A man stood gaping at her. He was a decent ordinary looking man. The astonished look on his face reminded her to pull the skirt down and she ran a hand through her hair. 

He said something to her but she quickly put the car in gear and sped off not hearing a word of it. He had seen her, watched her masturbating! She should have felt dirty and sordid but was instead exhilarated and floated home with a breeze in her sails. 

The outfit was washed clean but thought it could never ever be worn to the party after what had happened. The naughty public orgasm seemed to have opened up a whole world of ideas. Rose had never had such an orgasm. It had been uncontrolled and liberating. It had been refreshing rather than satisfying. Rose determined to see what might happen if she wore it again. 

*** 

The two men sitting in the bar talking together looked incongruous. Randall was tall, sophisticated and discreetly wealthy, whereas the younger man was short, dishevelled and flamboyant. 

John was a little rough looking but carried it off with youthful good looks, enough to be attractive to women liking a rugged charm. Women soon found him superficial once past the flirtatious period of a relationship and dumped him, which suited his purpose perfectly, as he merely wanted to have fun. One woman was different, finding something in him the others hadn't. 

"Bring me the CD and you'll have the flight ticket and payment in cash," Randall told him. 

"So! What will be on that recording exactly?" John asked. 

"It's just a business meeting, nothing illegal. It'll give me an edge, that's all. Just don't get caught breaking in to the hotel conference room or you'll give away the advantage," Randall warned him. 

"I know what to do. Everything's prepared. I've borrowed my brother-in-laws van for the job. With the excuse of checking out computers in the conference room it'll be easy," John smiled, trying to reassure this lucrative client. 

Randall's story was probably true but he still intended to check the recording in case he could make more from it. The air ticket and money would provide a good vacation but a little more was always welcome. 

The mobile phone rang. "Hi. No I can't I'm in a meeting. Yes it's a bar but its still business." John said, frowning at the intrusion. 

Randall watched him wave his hands around expressively. "A girlfriend giving you trouble?" he smiled with an arched eyebrow of enquiry. 

"Yes and no," John grimaced. Tipping back the drink he added, "Thanks, I need this. She's not my girlfriend, not since a few weeks back. She's so very attractive, it's a pity," he said, round a mouthful of whiskey. 

Intrigued Randall had to ask. "What's a pity about being attractive?" Randall enquired. 

"She likes to play games, bedroom games. Not my sort of thing at all," John said, with wink. 

Looking at John he could see it might not be. He was a straight to the point sort of fellow who gulped a fine malt whiskey. "What sort of games?" Randall asked, regretting the question already. He didn't want this oaf revealing a sordid love life. 

"I guess we all have something special that turns us on. Sometimes we don't meet the right person or happen upon that certain something," John said, looking uncharacteristically thoughtful. 

"I'm intrigued, you can't stop there! What is it John, you must tell me now," Randall asked, while signalling to the waiter for another round. 

"It all started when I met Rose at a fancy dress party. She was dressed as a Barbie doll. I took one look at her and couldn't see anyone else. That's saying something for me," he chuckled with is whole body flexing in amusement. 

"I took her home, nice place. For the entire weekend I treated her like a doll. I mean she wanted me to treat her like a doll. When she persisted with the game it became annoying. She keeps calling me for a special weekend. Apparently she hasn't found anyone else to play the game with," John sighed. 

"What does she look like?" Randall asked. 

"Well, I guess, like a Barbie doll," John laughed. "Long blond hair, long legs, with large breasts. They're perched over this skinny waist so it looks as though she'll fall over with every step she takes. She has a perfect petite figure, like a perfect Barbie doll. The outfit at the party was perfect. The skirt was short and she looked like a blonde bimbo," John laughed. 

"I was mistaken though. She's some kind of highflyer in an investment company. Now she wants to play at being a dumb blond, being ordered around, told what to do, what to wear," John told him. "I haven't got time for all that crap." 

"Sounds as though you need someone to take her off your hands," Randall smiled. He was intrigued with an overactive imagination working overtime. Often busy with business this sounded like the perfect playmate, ready to play at a weekend when he had some time. 

Randall sized John up as being unscrupulous, so perhaps they could make a deal over this too. The young man was sceptical at first but when Randall offered him an introduction fee he perked up, more so after another round of drinks. 

"Rose may not be so agreeable, to being foisted onto a stranger," Randall thought out loud as though exploring a new line of thought at the same sounding John out. 

Elaborating on a game plan for a special weekend John enthusiastically agreed. He was happy to make some extra cash while at the same time getting rid of Rose. 

On the phone to Rose, John clarified the arrangements to pick her up hoping she hadn't changed her mind. 

Her voice changed to a sweet innocent tone before ringing off. "That's sweet John. Thank you so such, I'm looking forward to it," Rose knew he wasn't into the game so it was all the more considerate of him. She dare not tell anyone else about this obsession, it would be just too embarrassing. 

She pulled on a coat and hat to go shopping. As a treat she would buy him some jewellery or a watch and while out she might as well buy a lovely new dress with all the necessary accessories. 

*** 

John thought she looked ridiculous prancing around in the lacy little outfit and kept telling himself it would soon be over. He had taken her to Randall's house where all evening she was happily preparing and fetching snacks and drinks. 

As long as he spoke to her and treated her like some dumb blonde doll she seemed happy enough. John just hoped this was not all a waste of time. He had half the fee up front, the rest when she agreed to stay the weekend. 

The only consolation was taking advantage of the opulent surroundings, especially the malt whisky. Randall was obviously rich and he was regretting not screwing more money out of him. 

When the front door slammed it seemed the spell was about to be broken. "Stand still doll," he told her. Watching carefully for a reaction he noticed the hesitation knowing she was reluctant to share the game with someone else. Apart from the party they had never been out or shared this fetish with anyone. 

"Be a good doll and do as you're told," he ordered Rose firmly. "This is Randall's house, a good friend of mine. I want to show off my lovely doll to him before we go," he said. John spoke reassuringly and firmly hoping she wouldn't run away from the intrusion of a stranger. 

Rose felt fragile verging on stupid. It was clear she couldn't leave without John as the house was out of town and she had no money on her. He had made sure of that telling her it was his treat. 

Rose froze on hearing someone enter the house. Earlier she wondered how John had obtained the keys to such a wonderful country house, even wondering if they were intruders. The fetish had become such an obsession she had quickly dismissed such unpleasant thoughts to immerse herself in the role. 

The thought of someone seeing her like this was dreadful. Despite herself a trembling thrill of expectancy ran through her body. Already feeling squishy she became hot at the thought of being shown off before a stranger. Unable to move she waited staring at the lounge door. 

The ornate door handle turned so slowly it was an agony waiting to be discovered. As the door slowly swung open she looked down at the antique Persian rug trying to hide a blushing face in long blonde hair.  

===

Randall walked in with a rehearsed indifference to the young woman. "Hello John, hope you've had a nice evening. My meeting completed early and I had nowhere to go. Felt too tired to visit the club, so here I am," he explained. 

He made no comment or move that might spoil their game hoping John would keep to the plan. He plonked himself down in a large wingback chair trying to seem relaxed. 

"This is my doll, Randall. Say hello, Sir," he told Rose. 

"Good evening, Sir," she murmured, looking embarrassed, nevertheless curtsying in keeping with the role. It was easier to sink into the role, as a way of escape, rather than face the awkwardness of explanations. 

Randall noted John seemed keen to show her off like a new toy. Perhaps he was thinking of upping the price. While she had her back to him preparing a drink he took a closer look at the so called doll. 

She indeed met the specifications outlined a few days ago. The little pink dress was less revealing than most young women wore to a nightclub yet it was alluring. It enhanced the feminine shape with an effect on Randall, leaving him staring at every twist and turn of that wonderful body. 

When she bent over to mix drinks the flared light hem bounced to reveal a pair of frilly panties. When she bent over him with a silver tray he couldn't keep his eyes off the ample bosom. He was reminded of John's remark that they were natural and over such a tiny waist, he was right, it looked as though she would topple in the high heels at any moment. 

Seeing her relax in their company he thought it time to step into John's role. "Bring me some snacks doll," he ordered. 

"What would you like, sir?" she asked quietly, acting as naturally as she had when responding to John. 

The evening went quietly enough with the two men trying hard to concentrate on a conversation made difficult from not knowing each other well. John was bored with the game but carried on with the charade. Randall was excited but kept it under control. 

Rose retreated into her game beginning to enjoy having two men to serve. She didn't want to be just a maid though. She wanted to experience again the feeling of being just a doll though still unsure what that meant or how to achieve it. 

It was getting late so as arranged John made his excuses leaving her with Randall. She looked as though she was about to drop the role and complain, wanting to leave with him. "Be a good doll and look after my friend," he told her and pecked her on the forehead. 

"Do you promise to look after my doll, Randall?" he asked. He watched her looking between them, unsure, yet still saying nothing. 

"I'll do my best John. The doll can sleep upstairs in the nursery. The bed there is made up ready. I'm afraid there are rather a lot of other dolls left there from when children used it. Do you mind sharing with other dolls?" Randall asked. 

John could see her caught in a dilemma, unsure how safe this was yet liking the sound of this new game. 

"Do you have time to show doll the room, to see if she likes it?" Randall asked. 

A good idea John thought and started to wonder how much preparation had gone into this. 

Randall guided them upstairs to show Rose a nursery still decorated in a Victorian style with many original features. A group of large dolls were sat around a small table, in little chairs, having tea. 

Trooping back down stairs John knew she was sold on the idea from the look in her eyes. He lightly kissed her cheek and made his escape. 

*** 

"You should have warned me, John!" Rose complained. 

John wisely kept quiet on the drive back to town. She had stayed the night but he somehow knew Randall hadn't taken advantage of her. He let her prattle on tuning it out. 

He stopped outside her apartment and waited patiently for her to take the hint. He watched her storm off taking little steps in the high heels. In case she looked back or decided to make peace with him he drove off. 

Next day he phoned finding she had forgiven him and was even thanked for the nice treat. "I've another treat for you, a better one this time. No I'm not telling," he teased. "All right, all right, I'll tell you part of it," he said. He smiled from intending to tell her part of it all along. The smile was for the part he hadn't told her about. With the phone disconnected he laughed out loud and rubbed his hands together thinking of all the extra cash. 

In Johns' name a box was delivered containing tissue paper, clear cellophane, pink ribbons and a designer dress. It was a big flowing flouncy dress any doll would be proud to wear. 

The box was far too large for its delivery but John had explained why. There were also clear written instructions for her to follow. Rose squealed and clapped her hands together, skipping around in anticipation. She changed into the dress admiring it from all angles. 

The box was a perfect snug fit for a petite doll named Rose in a full flowing pink dress. Not liking the dark she hoped not to be in it for long. The only advantage was she could fantasise while there. The disadvantage was she couldn't play with herself and she had down a lot of that recently. 

A clever arrangement meant she could close the lid onto herself from within. She then slipped her feet into slots then her hands into similar holes at the sides. It was these that prevented her from touching herself. It hadn't occurred to her the device and game plot were too sophisticated for John. She was too excited to think it through. 

Having hefted the wooden box out of a van Randall spoke his lines with some trepidation. John almost laughed at the absurdity whereas Randall didn't want to frighten the doll. John attitude was off putting but he would be soon gone, either with her or without. 

If she didn't take fright or become angry at this twist in the game John would be away. "Oh! This is great at last the present has arrived. I have been waiting for this doll for a long time. Be careful I don't want to break her," Randall said, feeling as wooden as the box. 

The conversation seemed ludicrous no different from when they rehearsed it. Although his expectations were greater even Randall felt foolish. If there was no-one in the box he was going to look ridiculous. There were a number of paranoid ideas that had occurred to him as he waited for this weekend. If his friends set him up for a gigantic practical joke he would never be able to set foot into the golf club again. 

For the buzz it gave him all this week it was worth what ever happened. If she laughed at him and ran away with John it would have been a near adventure. What was in the damn box? They played out the scene but still she did not appear. Was this good news? Had she fallen asleep? Was she going to jump out to shout and scream when he opened the gift-wrapping? 

For a moment he feared she had suffocated while under the clear cellophane until he noticed a slight movement of her rising chest. It was a full pearl white expanse of bosom above the curls of silk, moving silently and delicately. All else was now quiet with him left alone with the sleeping beauty. He knew she was awake. 

Tensely waiting for him to make the first move she dared not stir. Hearing his murmurs of appreciation of her beauty it was now obvious that John had delivered her to a stranger. The conversation would have been comical but she wanted to believe it. She wanted to be a doll delivered to an appreciative owner. She had at least worked out that feeling like a doll left her bereft of responsibility for her actions. She could dress as a man wanted and do whatever else a man wanted her to do. 

In the box she had to lay there, helpless, dreaming it was part of her game. Pretending to give her to a stranger was exciting and dangerous. All the more exciting because it was dangerous. Wrapped and delivered as a doll she was not in a position to complain. Hearing their story had been stimulating but fear of the unknown heightened the arousal. 

With the wooden box lid removed the stranger talked to her the whole time in a calming deep voice telling the doll she was beautiful and would be looked after like a precious gift. All that she wanted to hear was being spoken for the first time. John hadn't bothered himself to play like this. 

Lying back in the inner cardboard box she willed herself into being a toy unwrapped by a new owner. She felt him pull the cellophane lid up for his voice to be more clearly heard. She felt the soft tissue paper carefully caressed from around her limp body. Still she lay still unable to respond for it was easier to be just a doll. 

"Now I must bring my doll to life, with a kiss," he whispered. "Then I will have a breathing, living doll to play with." Still doubtful, only half believing, he played out the game. This would be the opportunity to find out how committed to it she was. 

Rose lay there beginning to tremble. For just two days of naughty behaviour she could stand whatever was to happen. If she enjoyed it, even better, but it was already the start of an exciting weekend to be remembered. 

Randall kissed her lips feeling them part, subtle and soft, ready for him. 

She felt his tongue gently probe then tenderly lick around her tongue. She dare not respond yet wanting to so much. 

He sat up watching her eyes flicker open as though from a deep sleep awakening like a fairy princess. "Don't be alarmed my fairy princess doll. I have bought you to be my doll. I am your new owner and will look after you," he whispered. 

At that moment she needed him to hold her in his arms. She felt it to be a most wonderfully romantic moment. As though reading her mind he lifted her from the box and sat back on a sofa. On his lap with arms tightly embracing her they again smooched. This time she responded with, exploring him with her tongue, each taking turns for gentle caresses, exploring each other faces. 

"What do you day my princess doll?" he asked. 

She hesitated at first unsure how to respond. She was also out of breath. "Thank you, master for buying me, I'm so happy to be your dolly," she cooed breathlessly. "What is my master's pleasure," she smiled. It was easy to say for she felt it with all her heart. 

John phoned to ask how they got on. "It went fine. Don't worry I'll send the rest of the money," Randall replied knowing exactly why he phoned. At least the rogue hadn't asked what they were up to. 

He walked back to the dressing room set up for his new doll. "Does doll like the outfits?" he asked. 

"Doll loves them all, master," she beamed. 

He loved the coquettish turn of her head when she spoke. Half turned toward him yet managing to look down in submission. The dress had been removed so she stood in a basque with stockings and suspenders which he had sent to her with the dress. He loved the idea she had dressed in sexy underwear not knowing it was for him. Now she was knowingly dressing for him, whatever he wanted, she would wear it. 

There was a wide range of outfits, from expensive silks to the down right slutty. He pulled at the hangers surreptitiously watching her reactions to each one. Out of the corner of his eye a smile was observed and sharp intake of breath was heard. She had a preference after all. 

"This will be appropriate this evening. Your master wishes you to wear this doll," he told her. He was using the word doll as many times as possible to reinforce the role but felt she was doing a good job of it on herself. 

She hesitated undressing in front of this stranger but bit her lip and repeated silently she was just a doll and had to do as she was told. It didn't matter what she did her owner was responsible. 

Completely naked she tried not to be anxious but the emotion soon returned to arousal. She was in a stranger's house naked and helpless, all the more vulnerable for being his doll expected to obey him. 

A short while ago she ran a department trusted to make decisions worth millions for a prestigious investment company. This was put firmly out of mind otherwise it wouldn't be possible to be whatever this stranger wanted her to be. 

Rose had been delivered as a fantasy princess dolly and he had been her prince charming for a couple of hours. He had purchased her and therefore owned her, so she had to obey him like a good little doll. She had even overheard him telling someone he would send the rest of the money to pay for her. Her owner had said he was very happy with her and the memory of that sent a thrill through her entire body. 

She slipped the baby doll night dress over her head letting it float down upon her shoulders. It was trimmed in fluffy pink feathers, completely see-through and finished around her hips. Accepting the panties from him sent a shock like lightening through her hand as they brushed together. 

She slid the panties up her long legs feeling another thrill knowing he was admiring and appreciating every movement of her body. They too were completely see-through. 

It was important to her to keep masters interested otherwise he might not play with her or even worse might sell her to another master. She didn't want to end up in a charity shop for some filthy old man to buy. 

"Why the sad look my beautiful enchanting doll?" he asked. 

"Your silly little blond dolly doesn't want to disappoint her master. Please tell your doll what to do to please you she will do anything, simply anything. Your pretty dolly so wants to please her master sooo much. Please master," she whined. Her hips swung from side to side and a finger was stuck into the side her mouth. She affected a lisp attempting to be an adorable little air head doll. 

If the team in the office saw her they wouldn't believe it was the same person. Gone was the hard headed efficient miss perfect. No longer was there the woman who expected everyone to jump with answers to impossible questions over impossible deadlines. 

"Ooo! They are so lovely master," she whined. She slipped on a pair of slippers also trimmed with matching pink feathery trimmings. She wasn't in the least embarrassed from being dressed like a high class whore. It might have occurred to her if she had been thinking straight that John had taken money as her pimp. 

It certainly had occurred to Randall. He meant to get his moneys worth but on seeing how genuinely she behaved in the role confirmed was more than that, much more than an act. 

He watched her float around the house getting to know it. She brought him a drink as she had that first evening. Only this time he didn't have to discreetly look down a cleavage for it was all on show and what a show it was. He couldn't help but look at her large breasts. Occasionally he looked at the triangle of fine blonde hair between her legs that gleamed bright as sunshine. 

She again stood before him swinging her hips seductively with the triangle of blonde hair flashing and shining through the thin gauze of material. She wanted something and he hoped it was what he too needed. 

Rose couldn't wait any longer. "Does master a have present in his pocket for his dolly? A big hard present?" she asked, with a cute giggle. Her breathing became deep and rapid. A wet finger worked in and out of her mouth in an unconscious yet all the more seductive show. 

"Get on the floor and you can unwrap your present my naughty doll," he told her. 

She crawled over to him almost drooling over the though of being a naughty dolly being used by her master. She needed no encouragement to unzip the fly of his trousers and he needed no encouragement to be ready for her. 

She dribbled over his cock and licked the wetness over its head down, its sides to his balls. She slurped over its head but restrained the impulse to suck it into her mouth. She looked up at him through long eyelashes with an enquiring look. 

He studied every moment with absolute relish, feeling every touch of her tongue on his throbbing cock. Her small soft hands made him look bigger and harder, enhancing his pleasure almost bursting point before she had properly begun. 

He realised she was waiting for permission to take her present but unable to speak he nodded consent. He watched the small mouth open wide, the perfectly shaped lips form an O, and tensed his whole body. The feel of those soft lips wrapped around his cock was wonderful. 

A hand was toying with his balls, the other gripping the base of his penis helping to hold him back. He watched the full-some lips smother his cock. Over the head and down the shaft they engulfed him. Up came her head slowly letting go putting pressure on it and sucking hard. 

Down again slowly maybe slightly faster but he was too carried away to notice. This time she had taken a deep breath and was pushing it into her throat. Without success she raised her head for another deep pull of air. This time she managed the fat of swallowing his cock. 

Again her head bobbed over him and he was amazed to see all of his cock taken down her throat. The grip was tight the suction mighty and on this bob of her head she sucked in one sharp lungful of air after another before plunging down once more. 

"Stop!" he whispered. He tried again but failed to utter a sound. She hadn't heard him so carried away was she and he couldn't summon the will power to stop her. She looked so perfect as though made to be there on the end of his cock. He was fighting with the need to take her pussy but gave in to her succulent ministrations. 

He pushed forward into her face with the wonderful life changing feeling of spurting cum. He watched the spasms of his cock busy in her mouth, spurting strings of sperm. He no longer cared it was her face he was fucking rather than her cunt. It was an animal need to orgasm that took over. 

Feeling the telltale spasms she pushed back with both hands on his knees, just far enough that he didn't shoot down her throat. At the same time an orgasm overtook her senses. She became rock still only her mouth gently, reflexively, sucking on his cock like a teat. 

Bathing in the warm glow of a deep orgasm she recovered just enough to kneel upright and became aware of her masters load filling her mouth. The salty taste was hardly noticeable and completely blown away by a feeling of fulfilment. The orgasm left her feeling replete; satisfied with the world and everything in it, especially with her role in life. 

Randall became aware of her kneeling before him not knowing how long she had been waiting. A serene look on her face was replaced by a contented smile on seeing his eyes open. She opened her mouth to show her master his precious sperm. He nodded and she made a show of swallowing it. 

He leaned forward and pulled her up off the floor onto his lap where he cuddled her holding on tight. She rolled herself up needing to be swaddled by her master, to be completely and safely enwrapped in his arms. 

Randall watched television unable to concentrate on the screen. Occasionally he would stroke dolls hair and pet her where she sat on the floor at his feet. 

She looked up at him admiring her master, knowing this weekend would be just so wonderful it threatened to overwhelm her. Her heart beat strongly in her bosom with the thought that she had at last a master who could give her what she wanted. She was his doll ready to be played with without responsibility or recriminations, whatever she did, whatever he wanted her to do with her. 

She hoped he would want to play this game again sometime and with this in mind determined to play it out to her best ability so as not to disappoint him. If he wanted to test her resolve with something distasteful she would comply as a doll only could. She set her mind to it. She would be his compliant doll for the whole weekend. She rested contentedly at his feet looking forward to carrying out whatever her owner desired.  

===

Rose was sitting at his feet while he watched a football game on television. She was his doll for the weekend and had determined to play out the fantasy role to perfection. It satisfied an inner feeling of being controlled and he played his part as her owner so well it gave her a warm inner feeling. It gave her such a constant buzz of arousal she became willing to do anything to satisfy him. 

"Lay back on the rug, doll," Randall told her. He hadn't been able to concentrate for a single moment with a delicious female at his feet but had to play his part. He could feel the sexual tension in her vibrating out like sound waves hitting his consciousness with a message of need. 

At last he was ready to play with her. She felt the pitch of emotions rise to almost breaking point. Her owner wanted to play with his dolly and she was more than ready. 

She wore a baby-doll with a little pair of panties; both see-through. 

"Open those long dolly legs. Wider," he said firmly. This woman had been delivered to him for a weekend of play and he had paid for the privilege. At first he thought she just wanted a sexual encounter without responsibility but it seemed she was on her way into 'dollification'. She was mentally evolving into a fetish living doll and he was more than willing to help her. 

He watched her open wide revealing a neatly trimmed pussy. "Now I own you, doll, you need a name. Amy. What do you think of it?" he asked. 

"Oh! Thank you master, master's dolly is so pleased," she squealed with delight. 

"You have learnt to sit still and will learn much more to become my treasured doll," he said with a big smile on his face. Her porcelain skin with fine bone structure added to the illusion of being a perfect living doll. The make up was hardly needed on an already smooth skin. 

"Your new owner will dress Amy up and play with his new doll but there are certain changes that need to be made. Amy's hair is long and glossy but Amy's pussy needs to be shaved smooth," he teased her. 

"Oh! Amy is so sorry master, shall dolly prepare now, master?" she asked, in a little cute whispery voice. Her eyes had opened wide with anguish over failing her owner. 

"Soon enough Amy. Right now your owner wants to play with his new dolly," he said with a touch of teasing pleasure in is voice, letting her know he wasn't displeased. 

Rose squealed with delight. For a slit second she wondered how she could possibly have revealed herself fin such lewd position but the intensity of the moment dispelled any inhibitions. She was just an Amy doll obeying its mater. 

It made it so much easier to let go when being a doll, being owned by this caring man and with a dolly name. She could leave Rose's busy pressurised past life behind for awhile. The living doll was evolving into a more effective plaything. It was becoming an object without human moral codes to restrict its sexuality. 

He didn't need to say anything. He slid from the armchair onto the floor beside her. Master Randall stroked her long golden hair fanning it out like a halo. He kissed her lips gently while she lay supine. Rose wanted to react but couldn't for she had mentally transformed into a compliant doll, no longer human; she was a beautiful doll cared for by a considerate owner. 

His hands fluttered over her thighs while little gentle kisses and nips from his teeth were felt through the light baby-doll dress. Her breathing quickened and her eyelids fluttered in double time. 

Like the gossamer wings of a butterfly skimming over a summer fresh delicate flower his lips touched her thighs. Tears of joy formed in the corners of big cornflower blue eyes, blurring the room and reality. Everything she had been was wiped away for her to feel nothing but a bundle of sensations erasing everything from her mind. 

Intense sensuous charges coursed into her brain from every touch. The little delicate panties were eventually brushed aside. A soft kiss upon her silken purse opened it revealing an inner throbbing passion. Never before had she experienced such patient and intense attention but this was not thought of as her mind became nothing but a reception for incoming messages of pure white flashes of bliss. 

Rose wanted to lift her hips to thrust up her sex at her owner as an offering to a love god. Amy became still, just the ragged breathing revealing the obsession as an orgasm coursed through her being and kept on taking her over. The continuous orgasm was replacing her soul until there was nothing left but a doll full of pleasure; a pleasure doll for her owner. 

Her owner sucked strongly upon her wet lips teasing out everything with a tongue reaching and searching. A finger stroked her clitoris until her bud felt like an on button permanently set to orgasm mode. 

Randall sat back to watch his doll twitching as she came down from a sexual high. He was satisfied with the result and worked his chin from the ache from so long working upon her pussy. She lay back replete, as though in a coma, looking more like a doll than she ever had. 

"Up you get Amy, onto the sofa," he encouraged her. "Lay back with your arms likes so," he said, while arranging them to dangle beside her. She took the hint and flopped into the corner of the sofa like a rag doll without control of her body. Her mouth hung open and he made a mental note to train that part of her body more thoroughly. 

Her head lolled into a comfortable position. He smiled at her. "That's my lovely dolly," he encouraged. "Your owner has some work to do so rest there for Amy must be ready to play soon," he added. 

When he left the room a sigh left her lips, looking as though she were deflating but it was an expression of fulfilment from deep within her soul. She concentrated on being a good little dolly for her master, not moving except to wriggling her toes and fingers avoiding cramp. 

At last the yoga and meditation exercises came in useful as she cleared her mind of everything. Little tenuous thoughts flickered through the dolls little mind concerning the pretty outfits in her room and what games her owner had in mind for later. She tried hard not to think and managed to look like an inert doll propped up in the corner of the sofa. 

Randall contacted John for more information on his new doll. He avoided awkward questions but John was waiting to be paid for another job so didn't press him. 

"Thanks for taking her off my hands, I hope you'll both be happy together," John said, in closing. 

The chuckle hadn't been malicious but Randall wondered if the guy had guessed at his intentions. It didn't matter as John didn't seem to have much of a moral code. He had paid John for the delivery of the doll to his home which added to the sense of ownership he felt. 

He walked in to the lounge seeing Rose still in the position he left her in earlier. She was obviously very much into this game and felt a deep sense of responsibility for the vulnerable doll he had purchased. 

"Up you get Amy my beautiful doll," he told her and helped the stiff body off the sofa. 

Upstairs he guided her into a relaxing bath. He washed her gently but thoroughly, smoothing his large hands of soft flesh. She lay back letting him take control of her body hardly having to move as he soaped and rinsed every delicate part of her. 

After patting her dry with big warm fluffy towels he sat her on the floor. The under floor heating warmed the comfy towels under her bottom. She became even warmer when she saw what he was about to do to her. 

"Spread your legs, Amy doll," he told her. He watched her open up to him as though it was his right to have everything exposed, as though he owned it all. 

Rose would have been highly embarrassed to reveal such a private place to a man, even a boyfriend. This man was a stranger though after such attention he had made her his. This wonderful man had earned the right to own her body and soul. 

"Hold still, Amy as I know you can, like a good dolly," he whispered to her. 

The steel of the razor felt cold against warm soft flesh as it glided down from below a flat belly. Closer and closer it scraped smoothly, ever closer to her lips. She couldn't help become excited for him, from what he was doing to her. Her owner didn't rebuke his dolly so she relaxed letting it happen. After all he was in charge and she could leave it up to him what to do and what not to do. 

He gently pulled at her lips to get into every nook and cranny at her crotch. Turning over he propped her up, bottom upward, sticking up in the air in an unglamorous pose. It would be embarrassing for a woman but for a doll it was acceptable for an owner to fix her any position he cared to. 

His hand glided smoothly over her belly down to her crotch with the other between her cheeks for them to meet. One pressed at her asshole the other between her lips. Between her engorged lips he found her bud to tease it into greater arousal. Her breathing quickened. 

"Not yet doll, Amy can't cum yet," he announced. 

She didn't immediately switch off she couldn't under such powerful provocation though she knew it would be worth the wait in her owners hands. It felt as though nothing existed but her crotch and that powerful captivating stimulus. Much more of this and she would never be anything more than a bundle of sexual, nerve tingling, sensations. 

He carried her from the bathroom to the bedroom in his powerful arms to sit on the edge of the bed. Rose brought her breathing under control but the fire in her belly smouldered ready to ignite. 

From the large walk in wardrobe he brought out a cute maids uniform. It was small and fluffy with all the extras; apron, cap, collar and cuffs. 

"You can look after me tomorrow morning then we shall see what kind of dolly you are best suited to be," he told her. 

"Thank you master," she smiled. Amy looked up at him with a look of adoration, showing pure pleasure from her owner's attention. 

He led her out of the bedroom to the master bedroom. A four poster bed was sited in the middle of the room dominating it. Persian rugs over polished floor boards, a sofa against one wall, discreet lighting over oil paintings and other discreet touches emphasised its opulence. Subdued lighting added to the romantic ambience. 

"Undress me Amy," he told his doll. 

She revealed a finely toned body, naturally tanned in far away places, piece by piece as she gingerly stripped her owner of his clothes. He shook off the leather slippers to stand naked before her. She wondered how any doll could have a more attentive and caring owner. 

He pulled back the covers on the bed and summoned her. With great care he arranged her body on the bed with finger kisses to each part of her naked body as he set it as he wanted. 

"Tomorrow it's Amy's turn to look after the doll master," he said with a big smile. 

She heard a shower tapping and her owner singing with gusto rather than a tune. Rose wanted to jump up and rush to him, to shower him with kisses and soap him as he had her. She wanted to touch him everywhere and use her body as his wash cloth but couldn't move for she was just a dolly. 

He bounced into the room wearing a big smile upon his face and nothing else, smelling of freshness and the rich scent of soap. A large penis preceded him and Rose grinned in anticipation. There were no doubts her owner had a use for his doll but seeing him rampant for his doll was a thrill. 

He crept up upon her over the large soft bed like a tiger after prey. The touch of a finger tip was electric. 

"Come to life Amy doll, be my living doll to play with," he commanded. 

She was jubilant and eager to play whatever her owner wanted. He grabbed her waist and pulled her on top of him. His knees pulled up so she was sitting back on them with legs either side of his torso. 

"What's this, my doll has here," he asked with mock curiosity. He pointed between her legs smiling, with his whole face creasing and eyes lighting up with pleasure. 

"My masters pussy, to use as he wishes," she laughed. 

"If it is a pussy why is it bare and not furry?" he laughed. 

Her face reddened with embarrassment despite everything she had submitted to already. "My master shaved his Amy doll pussy," she whispered sheepishly. 

"It is master's dolly pussy, so Amy doll had better keep it safe. Right now Amy doll had better use it to satisfy her owner," he advised. He pushed her forward with both knees so she slid onto the tip of his cock. 

He held her by the hips preventing the slide forward down his shaft. She looked at him with a pleading look wanting to be filled. Slowly she slid down his hard cock feeling it fill her, pushing at the sides of her vagina, seeming to open her up. 

She watched him reach forward to rub her lips and clit with eyes wide, a look of pain on her face that was instead pure lust. She slid down his cock with her weight impaling her body on its full length. 

Her head rocked back with a moan of frustration squeezed for her throat as she tried to lift herself from him, needing to ride him only this time she couldn't physically move. 

She tried to reach down to push up his shaft but the soft bed gave way under her hands. She tried to rock back and forth on his cock but his knees prevented it. She cried out in a fit of aggravation. 

"Fuck dolly master, fuck your dolly master. Please! Make your dolly cum, fuck Amy doll hard," Rose pleaded. 

He dropped his knees flat on the bed and thrust up with his hips lifting her up then held her body while pulling down, pulling his cock up her vagina. Savagely he thrust up at her suspended body. With every long hard thrust she let out a yell of satisfaction expressed in garbled appeals for more. 

She felt him spurt into her body a gallon of hot fluid filling up a burning hole with his juices. They collapsed into the bed his arms gripping her to him. The sweat soaked bodies sticking together becoming one. 

She laid her head on his chest hearing his heart beating a retreat. There was nothing more she wanted but to be there close to him feeling his cock slide from her to stick against her thigh, glued there with their blended juices. 

They awoke briefly to kiss and murmur loving sounds to each other then fell asleep. 

*** 

Sunday morning she awoke to see her lover and owner sleeping contentedly with a beautiful smile upon his face. She slipped from his bed to another bathroom so as not to wake him. A quick shower and she dashed to the bedroom that had meant to be hers. Pulling on the clothes he had chosen for she looked in on him gladly finding him still asleep. 

The kitchen was large and unused, all gleaming chrome and clean cupboards. She managed to find something to make breakfast and found a silver tray to arrange everything on, including a jug of cream. It was easy to guess what he liked for there was so little to chose from, which was one way of keeping a kitchen tidy. 

Standing patiently beside the bed, maid doll tried not to disturb its owner. A subtle clearing of its throat seemed to do the trick. 

Randall opened his eyes to see a beautiful maid doll with breakfast, waiting to serve him. She was dressed in a black dress flared out over the hips revealing suspenders, stockings and a nice pair of red silk panties pulled tight over her pussy. 

They cupped her lips in a most seductive way so much so he licked his dry lips obviously not from the smell of coffee, for he was staring right between her legs with a big smile on his face. 

The top scooped low to reveal the push up bra struggling to hold onto her large breasts. Her long blonde hair was tied up under a white cap, the unmistakable badge of a servant. The white collar, with cuffs about her delicate wrists, set off the expensive ensemble. This was no party costume or cheap nylon fake but an elegant designer outfit made to measure. 

His maid tidied the room while he freshened up and he sat on the bed watching her bend and stretch while she explored the unfamiliar room while dusting. She dressed her owner, pleased to see how captivated he was from watching her work. 

"Is there anything Amy doll can get her master?" she purred. 

"Nothing for the moment, just keep busy maid doll," he said, dismissing her. 

In the library she continued with chores while he tapped away at a computer. 

It was his turn to be teased and she used all her feminine charms to the best of her ability. Every movement was designed to distract him while pretending to clean with a feather duster. Bending over in the tight silk panties, gripping her cute bottom while she wiggled it seductively, was more than he could withstand. 

He came up behind to grab her about the waist pushing her over the back of a padded chair. 

"Oh! Sir!" she exclaimed in mock anguish, spoiling the effect with a gleeful giggle. 

"Maid doll, your master wants you," he demanded. 

Pulling the panties to one side was a struggle but it gave him time to loosen his fly. With his cock in one hand he used the other to keep Amy doll bent over the chair. Feeling his cock enter her she sighed as though about to deflate. Rather her whole body stiffened ready to push back on him. There was no need for he was past teasing her and thrust in hard taking her in one hard shove of both legs. 

Deep inside, then almost out again, he piston fucked her fast and hard. With every in stroke she breathed out a breath of sound as he crushed Amy doll against the chair. 

"Yes! Master, fuck your doll!" she breathed out in gasps. 

Again she was triggered to an orgasm by his cum filling her up. It was not so overwhelming as before but a satisfaction needed from the culmination of over stimulation of a sexy raucous game. 

Randall sank down into the chair while Rose pulled the panties and dress into order. 

"Is Amy maid doll satisfactory master?" she asked, with a curtsy. The demure innocent music in her voice was both endearing and teasingly sexy. It sounded as though she were asking about the cleaning task rather than the manhandling of her body. 

"Maid doll is most satisfactory. However, it is about time a change to dolls costume was made. Amy dolls master wishes to test his doll in another roll," he commented. He watched the look of glee on her face then change to one of inquisitiveness. She became animated, dancing on the spot as though she were about to wet herself. 

In the bedroom, that had become her dressing room, he looked through a wardrobe. There was another maid costume, made of black rubber, but he wasn't looking for that today. A flesh coloured all in one body suit was also passed over. 

"Here we are. Change into this and Amy shall be a different doll," he smiled. 

She pulled on the small sheath of white spandex. 

"There is plenty of makeup and your hair needs teasing out too. Take your time to get it right," he said, with a glint in his eyes. The challenge was now for her to take up and see what she could make of this change of character. He left her sitting at the large dressing table looking through draws at a wide range of cosmetics. 

It gave him time to research on the internet the corporation she worked for to gain more information about her. He came to an announcement about investments into new businesses. Seeing her name as the consultant involved he stopped to read the trite marketing write-up. The company's generous investment into a humanitarian health product was made the most of, only just mentioning the product itself. 

Randall searched for the professor and then his research organisation to find what they were developing. He sat back heavily to think. Was he putting two and two together to make five? Had this body suit triggered something in her, a deep seated need? The picture of a student wearing the suit was put together with the way Rose was behaving and it left him wondering. 

===

The more he read the more he wondered how involved she had been. Had she tried it on or just seen it demonstrated? Either way it could have brought out something from her subconscious that needed expressing. He wondered if she needed to be a doll like the one propped up on the sofa last night or was the need more generalised. 

He would soon find out when she prepared herself for him and came downstairs. 

She appeared in the doorway looking nervous. This wasn't the same doll from this morning or last night. The doll was a slut. The way she sashayed across the floor toward him, swaying her hips, was enough to answer the question. This doll could be dressed to become anything he desired. 

"Well, slut doll, you have taken your time. What have you got to say to your owner," he asked. 

"Amy slut is sorry to keep master waiting," she said, through deep red lips. Her hair was teased out forming a blond cloud around her head. 

She was trying to act as a slutty air head, only just making it, so he would have to help her along. "Bend over the desk for a punishment," he demanded. 

Bent over before him she hiked up the short dress to reveal a bare ass. He slapped it a couple of times and found she was already, wet so his doll was enjoying the role as he suspected. 

"Thanks master, Amy slut doll deserved a punishment for displeasing master. May Amy ask permission, master?" she said. Her voice had changed from the little innocent squeak to a more husky sensual sound. 

He looked at her seeing a difference in stance too, as she seemed to grow into this new role. It was the first time she had initiated a conversation too. He nodded assent. 

"Amy doll must pleasure master, please," she cooed. "To make up for being a naughty slut doll," she added, while swinging her hips from side to side. She was looking at him hungrily with seduction in her eyes. 

Again he nodded wondering what she had in mind. 

She got on hands and knees to crawl under the oak desk. It was a big leather topped desk but there was little room in the knee well for a woman in a tight dress. She managed to back in and looked up at him expectantly. 

"Master can carry on working, please, master," she whined. 

He let her unzip the trousers and pull his cock out while wondering how on earth he would be able to work like this. It would be sad if he was ever to work while she sucked and licked his cock. 

Rose noisily licked its full length before sucking it into her mouth. She was unsure how a slut should behave but this was a start. She fully intended to seduce him at every opportunity. 

*** 

It was early evening and the weekend was almost over. The slut costume was interesting but he had soon given in and made her change into something more modest to cool her down. Telling her to be a certain kind of doll worked but the costume helped get her into the role. 

"Come on doll its time to put you away for a little while," he said. 

The wooden box she had been delivered in was in a spare room. Inside it was soft packaging with a cardboard box embedded. She again stepped in dressed as a nice obedient dolly in a frilly frock. He helped place her limbs, pushing in the petticoats until tucked inside like an inanimate doll. 

He slid the stiff cardboard over her legs and arms fixing her in place. Next was the cardboard lid with a cellophane insert where she looked out with vacant eyes. Last of all was the wooden lid to be screwed in place. 

It was almost a relief to be free of the intense play. A whole weekend of playing sex games was so very demanding. Something he could get use to though. He chuckled at the thought. He hadn't had a chance to teach her to deep throat either. When she was dressed as a slut it would have been the ideal time but she hadn't given him a chance to rest. 

*** 

She almost didn't want to be delivered back home. Rose knew it all had to come to an end. Even the vacation would end for the boring routine of work to begin again. That thought brought her back to being Rose. It was difficult to shake off the Amy role and so she subsided into it for a moment or two. 

It was nice to let go without responsibilities but that wasn't real life. John had introduced her to a stranger then delivered her to him for a weekend of games. He hadn't asked her if she wanted to but had guessed right, so she forgave him. 

She thought about John remembering she had tried to buy his cooperation with gifts. He was that sort of guy. He had shown her off to this man and he must have approved of her so John gave her to him. Gave? Damn! He had sold her to a stranger for a weekend of sex! 

That made him her pimp, making her into a fucking prostitute! She hoped he had charged a lot. She suddenly remembered being paid for a blow job in that party costume shop. "Oh! Shit!" she exhaled. "Have I sunk so low just to satisfy this deviant craving? I'm so hungry to play at being a doll I'm willing to prostitute myself!" 

"What's next? Is John going to deliver me to someone else? Bastard!" she exclaimed on realising the thought was exciting her even more. Without thinking both hands reached for her sex. "Fucking bastard!" she exclaimed again, on remembering her limbs were fixed in place. 

She tried to squeeze her thighs together, the only option open to her. The folds of the dress were in the way preventing any kind of help with the frustration. With a deep breath she lay back and thumped the inside of the cardboard box. The restricted movement meant it was just a light blow but then no-one could hear her in there even if she screamed. 

Her thoughts drifted back over every sex game enjoyed, with the dreadful thought that she would even pay him to experience another passionate weekend like that. There was no choice, she just had to wait and see what was to become of her. She calmed down a little with a calming yoga meditation. 

Rose wondered what it might be like to live the rest of her life being delivered to one owner after another. Having a stranger unwrap her and learning to serve a new owner would be demanding. She had subsumed her previous life effectively in just one weekend to become a living doll, so what might happen to her after a few weeks, or months? After years of being a living doll she might never be able to go back, not even remember a previous existence. 

A little gasp escaped her lips as she realised this thought wasn't frightening and didn't bring forth a determination to fight it. At last she knew how vulnerable she was, that deep inside she would accept it. 

*** 

A sound woke her. Rose was so exhausted the delivery of her box hadn't roused her. Without warning, unable to prepare herself she was being un-wrapped by a new owner. 

Rose told herself not to be silly. Even John couldn't possibly kidnap her into prostitution. He had low morals but she would be missed by those in her department and her boss. She couldn't think of anyone else for she had worked long hours and too many weekends to keep close contact with friends. 

The lid was removed flooding bright light over her. Blinking to get her sight back she managed to work out this wasn't her apartment and the dark silhouette of a man wasn't John. 

She screwed up her eyes in fright. The nightmare she had played out in her mind was becoming a reality. The man picked her up in his arms and laid her on the floor. 

She had worked out what would happen to her if she didn't fight to retain her personality. She would become a compliant sex doll, pandering to a man's fantasies, when John sold her for a weekend of debauchery. It didn't matter what kind of doll the stranger wanted her to be, deep down, she would know she was just a whore doll. 

If she didn't make a stand now she would be condemned to a lifetime as a mindless doll. The terrible thing was a powerful force inside was draining her will to fight it. 

"Come to life my Amy doll," Randall said. He watched her eyes flicker open. She had obviously been in a deep sleep, even a trance. She had been in there over night and Monday morning while he was away for some hours. It was no wonder she was so disorientated. 

He stroked her hair and face with delicate touches not wishing to startle her. 

"Your master has made arrangements for you to stay. This is Amy doll's new home now," he informed her. 

It had been easier than he first thought. A resignation email from her computer had been accepted by the corporation. A text to a few friends had elicited good luck wishes in her new career. 

As far as anyone was concerned, she was on her way to Hong Kong and a new job. The apartment lease had been relinquished and her belongings were to be crated up and delivered into storage. He would take his time sorting what should be kept or disposed of. 

"Oh master, thank you, master," Amy whispered in gratitude. Her master had saved her from becoming a whore doll, passed from stranger to stranger. She would try hard to please her owner, throwing every thing she had into becoming his perfect doll. 

"Lay still for a moment. Take deep breaths," he told her. He arranged the dress and limbs taking in her subtle doll like beauty. 

Randall now owned the doll for ever and would carefully look after it. He would mould it into a perfect human doll. Once it was able to stand he would have it dress in a more suitable outfit. There were several all in one doll suits in the wardrobe. They would help it get into the role of being a permanent living doll.  

===

Bill hadn't seen Rose for some months. At a fund raising dinner they bumped into each other. He hardly recognised her. She looked as attractive as ever, and gave him a big smile. 

"Hello, sir," she demurely said. 

"Err, hello. How are you?" he asked. She looked well and had a contended look about her. 

"I'm fine, very good in fact. I have often thought about that day we spent together," she quietly spoke. 

"I'm sorry, I really am," he began. 

"No! Don't be sorry. That moment led me to become, I mean, it made me discover something wonderful. I'm with Randal now," she told him, while nodding in the direction of her master. "I persuaded him to bring me here," she said, looking distant for a moment. 

Bill noticed she spoke with a feminine, doll like voice. He saw that she was dressed like an exquisite doll, and became worried that the programming had permanently altered her thinking. 

"I'm his special doll," she beamed at Bill. "I really am! I'm his dolly to play with, all the time. He looks after me so well. We play a delightful game at home. He really knows how to master me," she giggled. 

"I wanted to thank you for liberating me. After you pretended to make into a doll, well, it made me think deeply about what I needed in life. I've got what I want now! I just wanted to thank you so much," she gushed, and grabbed him for a warm hug. 

"Don't look like that! It isn't something you did wrong it's what I really want. I have never been so happy in my life. I wasn't suited to that job it made me mean and angry all the time. Now I am perfectly happy, really I am. Please, be happy for me, Bill," she implored him. 

He smiled and hugged her back. What could he say? She was the most beautiful woman in the room. Unlike most of them she looked radiant, and so contented, she beamed a powerful light of happiness all around her. 

"Randall is going to donate a huge amount to your fund. He is a very loving man and thinks the world of me. He's doing it out of respect of what you do, as well as a special thank you for giving me to him," she smiled. 

Randall's contribution inspired others to give larger amounts than they intended. The experimental stage shifted gear into production, and Bill accepted she was right. He had nothing to regret over that moment of madness in the laboratory. 

*** 

Reminiscing in his golden years, while recounting the story of how it all started, Bill unintentionally mentioned the episode with Rose. His grandson hadn't heard this story before, and quizzed him until the sordid story was revealed. 

They chuckled over it, but he made David promise not to tell anyone. 

"Little does anyone know this business is founded on a quick," he started to say. 

"Hey! Enough of that young man. She was a fine lady and a generous patron," the old man fired at his young grandson. 

"One day you will inherit all this," he murmured. 

"What, that old easy chair and cushions?" David quipped. 

Bill chuckled at the young man's irreverence. He was only eighteen and would soon learn that running a business brought heavy responsibilities. He just hoped the light heartedness wasn't swamped by problems and worry. 

David was sitting on the sofa thinking deeply. The business, according to his father, was growing, though not making a huge profit. He sat there thinking about dolls and androids. A new branch of the business seemed a good way to put their good works on a sound footing. 

*** 

"I know the arguments in favour of your product, so there is no need to reiterate them. I am here to see your factory for myself," Linda stated. As leader of the Moral Right party she was used to getting her own way. She had the habit of brow beat everyone into accepting her decisions. 

"You haven't given us a chance to put our case forward. You simply brought your negative opinion along with you," David sighed. He was feeling old at fifty- four. He had seen off takeover bids, world recessions, countless other problems, and now this. 

"What you are doing is wrong. It is as simple as that," Linda fiercely said, with a finger poking his chest, directly at his heart. 

It might as well have been a knife. She was an important politician, with a predetermined opinion that couldn't be turned. She wouldn't even countenance a compromise. 

"Since distributing these dolls a lot of good has been engendered, just look at the crime statistics," he implored. 

"We are not going to agree on this point. Time is pressing, so I must go," Linda said, rising from the chair. 

"Not so fast. Won't you at least listen to our arguments for continuing production," he sighed. 

Linda was annoyed. She wanted him to accept the decision, and show her out. Even if he didn't accept it, she was ready to go. She watched him handling a remote control stick. She cringed at the thought of another boring film show. She had fallen asleep during the last one, the only time not wasted while there. 

"Sit down please," David softly spoke. 

"I am ready to go," Linda repeated, and was annoyed to have automatically sat back down. It was politeness that had her reluctantly sitting, when she wanted to leave. 

"There is no point going over old ground, the decision has been made. It's final, and there is nothing you can say, or do, to change my mind," Linda firmly stated. 

"You want to close the factory. I want to keep it open. Simple as you said. Well, desperate times call for desperate measures," he sighed. "They are a good way of teaching men how to treat a real woman," he again explained, while fiddling with the control stick. 

He could see the look of boredom clearly expressed from the way she sat. She wasn't about to see reason, so he had to press on with the drastic plan. His grandfather, Bill had saved the very first project by using such a ruse. He made a business consultant think she had become a doll. 

It was his grandfather's guilty confession that gave him this idea. 

Bill's original factory was still manufacturing limbs and robotic body parts. They were used for accident and disease victims, to get them back to normal life. It was these doll's that kept it in production, as the factory wasn't self sustaining financially. If this one closed, there would be thousands of people unable to function normally, or worse. 

David owed it to the memory of Bill to keep his inventions alive and kicking! 

Linda tried to stand up, prepared to find her own way out of the building. 

"I can't stand up. What have you done?" Linda asked. Her eyebrows were wrinkled in consternation. She had only caught a little of what he said, not bothering to listen to yet another set of excuses. 

"It's not the chair, it's you. Or to be specific, it's you're brain," he stated. 

Linda shivered from the way he looked at her. "What do you mean? Have you done something to me?" she asked, in a less determined voice than usual. 

"Yes, I am afraid I have," he said, while fiddling with a controller. It was a pen like stick, with small buttons on the side. Several sections swivelled, as though the sections were being unscrewed. 

"You can't. I won't allow it," she remonstrated, while trying to stand. Now she couldn't move her arms! Linda became frightened. She knew how advanced their technology was. She wrinkled her nose, confirming she had facial control. 

"It's no good struggling. You are under the control of this," David said, holding up the pen. He couldn't look her in the eye. He looked shifty and uncomfortable. It wasn't true he was using a similar to a trick his grandfather had used, so many years ago. 

Without knocking, a young man entered the office, interrupting the boss. 

David looked relieved. "Are you sure about this, Nobel?" David asked. 

"For sure, after all, what choice is there?" Nobel said, with a shrug of his shoulders. 

"Come with me," Nobel told her. He was David's son, and had been introduced as the sales and marketing director. 

Able to stand she felt better, until marching off behind the salesman. "Excuse me, is this the way out?" she asked. The calmness of her voice was far from the way she felt. A rising panic threatened to overwhelm her. From their brief conversation, and the way she responded to commands, it was all very alarming. 

"Where are you taking me?" Linda asked. There was an unpleasant pleading tone in her voice. 

"To the warehouse, where we finish off the dolls," Nobel explained, while they traipsed along. 

"I've seen enough! I want to leave, I've got important things to do," she complained. 

"You mean like close down a plant that manufactures a sophisticated, profitable product. This product has consistently reduced sex crime over the last two years. It helps finance replacement parts for injured people, so they can lead useful lives. You want to stop it, why?" he asked. 

"Well, maybe we could talk about it," Linda suggested. She gave up trying to fight it, and continued following him. All she could do independently was talk, so she would have to reason with him. 

"It's not my decision. I could try and influence the committee in your favour," she offered. The thought of artificial body parts was bad enough, but sex dolls were completely repulsive to her. Why should poor people have the same opportunities as important wealthy people? If they couldn't pay they should accept their lot in life. 

They pushed through a door into a large workshop. The purpose built space was filled with robotic machinery. What was she supposed to make of it that could possibly influence the decision? 

"You haven't noticed your new skin texture," he stated. 

She looked at her arms, to see what he was referring too. "What have you done to me?" she gasped. It seemed a question too often repeated in the last ten minutes. 

"Don't worry, it's not permanent. It will come off with the right treatment. It's a plastic skin used for burn victims. It's very thin, yet an exact replication of a doll's skin. On top of yours, it can be lot thinner than a dolls'. It has the same look and feel, as you will find out. Your skin can breathe through it so it won't be harmful," Nobel told her. 

"Why? Why have you done this to me?" she asked, with a pronounced pleading in her voice. 

"As David explained, it's to give you some, 'up close experience'," he smiled. 

His expression wasn't comforting. Her normally adroit conversation dried up. 

"Now then, let's take a look at how these new models are shaping up," he smugly told her. 

Linda followed him across the floor weaving a way between machines. It took a moment or two to take it in, then the scene before her hit hard. 

"Oh! No! What have you done!" she shrieked. She stared in horror at herself, lots of her, all lined up. 

"They are, they're, dolls, they are me," she stuttered. 

"We set up the template from photos of you. While you 'slept', we measured you and refined the template. So what do you think?" he smiled. 

"Do you expect me to answer that? It's outrageous," she bitterly complained. An army of dolls confronted her. As chilling as it was, she couldn't look away. They were naked, so it was obvious how anatomically correct they were. It was embarrassing, as though she herself was naked. 

"If you are thinking of blackmailing me with these things, you can forget it," she fiercely stated, trying to sound defiant. Her usual confidence had been knocked about too much. She found it difficult to comprehend what was happening. 

"We have no need to do that. We've decided upon a different approach, something unique and hopefully more effective," he said. "They are correct in every detail as you can see. We took advantage to check every detail, while you were 'sleeping'. You were drugged of course," he shrugged, as though it were insignificant. 

"Go join the other dolls," he ordered. 

"No! I will not!" Linda bitterly stated. Even as she complained she marched over to join the rows of dolls. To her horror she had no option but fit into one of the rows. 

There were twenty-nine of them and she had become number thirty. She found herself among them, looking exactly like one of them. It was chilling. When they marched toward a room, she followed, even keeping in step. 

The two in front picked clothes off a hanger and began to get dressed. She undressed then copied them, until dressed as they were. In an about-face, they marched out again. 

Linda looked around at the Linda dolls, cringing from embarrassment. There was no need to look in a mirror, for she was surrounded by twenty-nine exact duplicates. 

She was wearing a frilly pink skirt, with a pink boob tube. With this plastic coating, her breasts looked bigger, and they also stood out without a bra. Being less saggy didn't mean she liked them. She wanted to scream at this terrible outrage. Instead she tried to remain calm. 

They were sure to be filming this, and it wouldn't do to be shown ranting and raving, like a lunatic. Her public expected her to be a rational moralist. The call to close this disgusting factory down was a part of her campaign to change society. 

They were producing dolls for men, and women, to play with. They were sex dolls! They had copied her image to manufacture sex dolls! They looked very accurate too. Her colouring, figure, and face, all had been perfectly copied. Damn them to hell! 

They had her wearing this stupid outfit, especially designed to be embarrassing. It was bad enough seeing so many exact images wearing the ridiculous outfit. It was far worse to be wearing it. Standing helpless among the dolls was so infuriating it was hard not to scream at him. 

"This is outrageous! You can't dress me up however you like. This skirt is indecent, it's far too short! I demand you give me back my clothes," Linda firmly stated. 

"Don't you like pink? Everything is colour co-ordinated. Lift up the skirt and you'll see," Nobel smirked. 

She lifted the skirt as ordered. "I don't need to see them, I put them on in the first place," she growled. 

"If you don't like them, I'll get you to take them off," Nobel told her, while holding up the control stick. 

"No! They are fine, just leave them on. Now you've seen them I can lower the skirt," she angrily stated. 

"Don't you ever use polite conversation? Not a 'please' or a 'thank you' has passed those lips since you arrived," he said. 

"Please, may I lower my skirt, please," she said, emphasising each 'please' with sarcasm. 

"Lower your skirt, if it makes you feel any better," he smiled. "Best get on with the preparation," he said, while lifting the controller. 

"What do you mean?" she squeaked. "My voice," she squeaked again. "What have you done to it?" she asked, in a girly, high pitched tone of voice. 

"Any higher and it would be annoying. I think we have the voice just right. It sounds sweet and adorable, or at least that's what we aimed for," Nobel told her. 

"I can't go around speaking like this. Please, put it back to how it was, please," she begged him. The plea sounded more giggly and fun than she meant it too. It was painful hearing her voice sound so pathetic. The strident tones of authority had evaporated, leaving a sweet little girly voice. 

Damn! These were sex dolls, and would be distributed with this ridiculous voice. She would become a laughing stock. Not to mention the clothing. The anatomically correct body, under the nasty outfit, meant only one thing. Men would play with these dolls, as though they were her! They could do nasty, despicable things to a life sized image of her. 

That was why this place must close. Despite what they said, it was disgusting, and denigrated women. What she couldn't understand was those foolish women disagreeing with her. The statistics might be correct, with rapes and sexual abuse way down, but this was still wrong. 

Especially so, when her face and body was going to be used! 

"Oh! No!" she yelped. Her face would be used by nasty men for their nasty ways. Speaking against the use of dolls like this wasn't going to convince anyone, for it sounded too pathetic to be taken seriously. 

"Please, sir. Can I have my proper voice back? Please," she whined. It was a pitiful sound, leaving her feeling weak and vulnerable. The bastard was enjoying it! 

"Please sir," she started to say, only to break-off the plea. Her voice was so pathetic it was difficult to continue. The words, 'please sir', sounded natural to it in a bad way. 

"Each of you speak in turn," Nobel clearly stated. 

"How may I serve you, master," the doll standing next to her asked. 

She would have jumped in surprise, if she hadn't been so completely under his control. The voice was exactly the same as hers, or, hers was now the same as it. 

"May I show you my lovely panties, master?" the next one asked. 

One by one they asked permission to show off their body, or offered to demonstrate a lewd sexual skill. Linda was furious to be subjected to such disgusting language. She would have these two men arrested for kidnapping, and as many other charges that could be thought of. 

She quietly fumed while waiting for the last of them to complete the revolting litany, of highly objectionable phrases. She could at least turn her head away from him and those repulsive objects. She was planning on turning the plant over to a party supporter, to produce useful automatons for industry. 

Whatever happened, these humiliating Linda dolls would have to be destroyed. 

"That's enough! Humiliating me is not going to work. I demand you release me. Right now," she squeaked. The statement didn't have the same authoritative ring to it. Yet it no longer mattered. Linda was beyond caring what she sounded like. 

"What do you hope to achieve from this unpleasant demonstration?" she asked. 

"This is the final test, before we release them onto the market. Body functions have already been passed," he smirked. 

She didn't want to think about what that meant. "You have to release me, so do it now," she told him. 

"Oh, I am surprised! Are you in a hurry to be released onto the market? That is encouraging. Can't wait to get out there, to serve your function!" he laughed. 

"Don't be ridiculous. You have to let me go, so do it right now, or it will be prison for you," she stated. 

"It's already gone beyond a joke," he mused. "The boss was reluctant, but I persuaded him to go along with it. Just the two of us will be held to account. I'm banking on you not wanting the truth to get out, once I've finished with you," he said. 

He looked worried, which heartened her. She was about to push him further when a different thought occurred. He was worried about his plans for her. Not just this demonstration. 

"What do you mean?" she asked. 

"This batch of dolls will be released onto the market. If they become popular, more will be manufactured. We have plenty of blanks, waiting to be moulded to your features and build. We will keep you out of the way, while these are sold. It will make it difficult for you to be taken seriously after that," he stated. 

Linda looked even more worried, as it seemed they had a viable plan. "How will you stop me from blocking the distribution?" she asked. Linda was tense, with a nasty premonition about his answer. 

"You will be controlled, like you are now. You'll be kept out of the way for as long as it takes. The best way to hide is in full view, right out in the open, for all to see," he said. It was a good plan, though now he wondered if they could actually carry it through. 

"I'll shout and scream, until you are both hounded into oblivion," Linda ranted. Her voice was rising to a scream, until it suddenly cut off. For a moment it seemed she had run out of words of condemnation; which would have been a first. She took a few deep breaths, to regain some calm. 

It was no good. She couldn't speak! The damn maniac had taken control of that too!

"A demonstration model is always sent out when a new version is released. You will be that demo model. You will be on display, around the country. Don't worry. I'll be with you, looking after your bodily functions. I'll make sure you're fed and watered, as it were," Nobel said. 

"A douche and enema will keep you clean. You will need loosening up, as the stores like to make full use of a demo model. Their regular customers get a preview of the new models skills," he explained. 

Linda remembered the litany of disgusting skills the dolls recited, and mentally shuddered. The mental reaction was all she could manage now she was completely under his control. 

"Everyone will think you are in hiding somewhere, away from the humiliation of having a sex doll modelled after you. This is why we asked for the meeting today. You were due to go on a long break, while the government is between sessions. There will be awkward questions, but I'm sure we can manage them. After all, you have a lot of enemies who would be pleased to see the back of you," he stated. 

He was obviously trying to convince himself it would work. The more she thought about it, the more viable the plan seemed. Shit! These men were mad! They couldn't get away with such a disgusting scheme. Someone would miss her. Her secretary would expect her to arrive at the mountain retreat hired for the break. 

She was intending to plan the next campaign. It had been her intention to contact supporters of the Moral Right Party, to rouse them for the coming elections. Surely she would be missed, and a search to find her would be made.

Mildred, Linda's long suffering secretary, was fuming. The infuriating woman had her waiting around in the wilderness, without a word about the delay. Where in hell was she? The next day she decided to relax and began to hope Jane never turned up. It was typical of the harridan not to keep her informed of a change in plans. 

Mildred phoned around the most important of the supporters, cancelling the meetings. Some of them seemed relieved to avoid her presence, and the inevitable haranguing to do more, and work harder on the campaign. No-one dared ask what she was up to, which was the only good thing about working for the damn woman. 

At last relaxing by the pool, she toasted Linda with a forbidden martini. It tasted so much better because her boss was planning on campaigning against alcohol.

Linda awoke feeling muzzy headed. The sedative was wearing off. That stupid man was looming over her. He was talking, though it was difficult to concentrate on what he was saying. Linda stood up and straightened the little skirt and top. Looking down it became obvious she had arisen from a packing case. Damn! What in hell were they up to? 

"What are you?" Nobel asked. 

"I'm a Linda doll, sir. Ready to serve you, sir," she said, with the put on girly cute tone. She inwardly cringed at the sound of her voice. It had always been so strident and demanding; calculated to get what she wanted. 

"Impressive, very impressive. This is the best model yet. I can see why you came over to handle this personally," Heath chuckled. 

"Don't worry, if there's any trouble I'll handle it," Nobel reassured him. 

"I'm not worried at all. If there's a demonstration from those loony right wingers, it will give my store some free publicity," Heath laughed. 

"That's a good way to think about it. It's why I picked your store to be the first," Nobel said. He was more worried than it showed. It could all go badly wrong, if a big enough protest was made. 

"Linda. Follow me," Nobel clearly stated. The three of them walked out of the storeroom into the store. 

Following the horrible men, Linda scanned the place with her eyes, unable to move much without orders. Oh! Hell! He had taken her to a sex shop! She had thought it was all a bluff. This didn't look like a threat to gain her co- operation. 

"Step up there and make pose number four," Nobel ordered. 

Smartly climbing onto a small platform, she became aware it was the store display window! Dressed in the brief pink outfit was embarrassing. Displayed in a storefront window for all to see was horrendous. 

Without the slightest self control she stood up straight, pushing out a fine pair of breasts. After a moment or two she turned around and bent over to show off the frilly pink panties. She turned her head to look over her shoulder with a big smile plastered across her face. Still early in the day there was no one around to see the lewd display. 

The dire set of poses was repeated, keeping her moving and free of cramp. Considerate of the bastard, she thought. The thin material only just covered her private parts. It wasn't this bothering her. It was the demeaning position she was in that almost crippled her thoughts. 

It was imperative she kept hold of her mind, otherwise she might go mad. Desperately she tried to think of an advantage to be gained over these despicable men. Publicity would gain support and motivate supporters. Their businesses would be crippled by litigation. The compensation for this horrendous experience would add to her wealth, and money meant power. 

Looking over her shoulder a smile of satisfaction was displayed. It was meant to be enticing, while showing off her panties, with a big welcoming smile. The come hither look was meant to attract customers, though so far, there were only store owners hurrying past. 

Linda continued with the routine, straightening up and bending over, desperately telling herself, it would all work out well in the end. 

Later in the morning a crowd gathered around the lewd display. She glared at them with her eyes, though continuing to smile and look enticing as ordered. She just hoped her supporters would soon hear of this terrible situation. 

Special customers with invitations to view the new model were arriving. The added incentive of wine and snacks was on the invitations. They hardly touched the complimentary buffet, for the new model was so entrancing. 

"I can't believe you are getting away with this," Joe commented. 

So far so good, Nobel thought. He had his mental fingers crossed, knowing it could all go badly wrong. 

"Follow me," he told Linda. 

At last she was allowed out of that damn window display. Having to smile while walking among a group of strangers was nothing new to her, for the campaign trail demanded it. All she had to do was forget how deplorably vulgar the clothing was. 

"Use the speech program six," Nobel commanded. 

"Hi sir, I'm Linda and want to be your sexy little slut. You will find I am worth every cent, when you buy me and take me home," she cooed, with a cute tinkling voice. The ridiculous tone of voice was forgotten, when compared with the demeaning words. 

"So what do you do, Linda?" Joe asked. 

Linda hesitated, wondering what to do next. If only she could put these men in their place with the usual high handed riposte. 

"I will do anything you like, sir. I'm a super sex doll with a real vagina, and all the naughty bits to go with it," she cooed seductively. This almost pushed her over the edge of sanity. Instead she held onto the deep burning anger. 

"What about your ass," Joe asked. The group of men surrounding her raucously laughed. 

"My bottom is ready to take your cock, sir. It will be a tight fit, but I am sure I can accommodate you, sir," she pleasantly answered, as though simply telling him the time of day. 

Nobel figured it was time to ramp up the doll's reactions. 

"It can be tedious having a horny woman around all day. When you feel like it a simple twist of the controller is all it takes to bring her to a state of arousal. There, you now have a sexed up slut, all ready for you," Nobel demonstrated. He made sure she saw his manipulation of the device. 

"Oh! Yes! Sir, my asshole is ready for you! Unless you would prefer something else," she breathed heavily. Linda became breathless and hot. She pressed up to the man, rubbing her breasts against him. Without direction she was trying to seduce him, having become so aroused. 

The sexual excitement was impossible to resist. Her mind and body was out of control. A sexed up body was influencing her mind. All thoughts were directed toward gaining satisfaction. A small voice inside her head was shouting for release. The rejection was going unheard, by a dominating need for a very different kind of release. She needed a man to satisfy an overwhelming craving for cock. 

"Please, sir, please," she murmured. 

"What do you want," Joe asked, with an amused look plastered across his face. 

They were in a private room at the back of the store. It was decorated like an unconvincing dungeon, mainly with a range of products for sale; which was its main purpose. 

"May I suggest you try out her mouth? I'm sure Linda would love to accommodate you all. Nobel suggested. "You are a suck slut Linda, addicted to sperm," he added. 

There was no going back now, so why not go all the way. 

He was interested to see how well she handled the task. The controller he used didn't really work on her mind, she just thought it did. Certain ideas had been implanted through suggestion, letting her think she was controlled like a doll. It was hypnosis heightened with a mixture of drugs. That didn't mean she could accomplish a blow job with any finesse. 

"May I, please, sir! Your suck slut would just love to feel all your delicious cum filling her belly, sir," Linda gushed and begged. Before Joe could answer she was on her knees, pulling at his zip. 

She licked his cock as though it were a delicious treat. With one swift movement she sucked his cock down her throat. The others were taken aback. Joe was an extrovert, with a big cock, and beamed with pleasure. 

She bobbed her head in a steady motion, up and down the length of his proud member. 

Linda switched off moments before sinking to her knees. She would never practice such a despicable sexual act, not even in a long term relationship. Leaving the Linda doll to carry on was her only escape from the horrendous situation. 

Joe hardly showed a reaction when he cum. He spurted down her throat, while his cock was buried deep inside. He could feel her tightly gripping his cock. The image of having that important woman Jane, sucking him was so much more exciting, he hadn't lasted long. She was sucking every last drop from him, while working his balls with one hand, and his cock with the other. 

As promised she was a serious cum slut. 

"I'm going to have to sit down after that! This doll is really something, Heath," he sighed. 

The others were more reticent, so Heath offered them a more private room. Linda eagerly took the first of them by the hand, leading him off with a look full of pleasurable expectation. Report_Story
