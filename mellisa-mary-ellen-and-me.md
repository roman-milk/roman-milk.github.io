 ****** Mellisa, Mary Ellen and Me Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Up front I'll say that I'm no Adonis. I'm not movie star handsome, I don't have an especially great body and truth be told I'm not much more than average in any of the hundreds of things that women look for in a man. God only knows why Mellisa decided to chase after me. 

 I started working part time for the XYZ Corporation when I was a seventeen- year-old high school student. I continued working there when I started college and at nineteen when a full time position opened up I applied for it and got it. It was a hard life for me trying to handle a fulltime job and a full load of sixteen credit hours at school. I had zero social life, but it didn't matter to me because I had a goal. I was determined to get a degree and get a good paying white-collar job. I was not going to end up like my father who spent his life working the blast furnaces at the Ford Rouge Plant and who came home every day worn out and beat down. To dad it was a great job. It was union, paid well and had great benefits, but it was back breaking labor and it just wasn't what I wanted for myself. I fully intended to make that early start at XYZ, coupled with my degree, lead me into middle and upper management. 

 I didn't know it at the time, but the Gods were looking down at me and smiling upon me with favor. I'd caught the eye of Jason Banks, president and CEO of XYZ, and he was pointing me out to others as "the kind of employee that this company needs in order to grow." I didn't find out about this until much later, but he kept an eye on me during my first year at college and used various contacts of his to keep him informed of my progress and my grades. When I was mid way through my sophomore year and my GPA was holding at 3.79 in spite of the fact I was working 40 to 45 hours a week at XYZ I was called down to the Personnel Office. The personnel manager told me that my hours were being cut from 40 hours a week to 24. Before I could register disappointment at the news he went on to say, "We are doing this so you can spend more time concentrating on your studies. There are some in this company that believe that a young man with your determination can go places in the company." He pushed some papers across his desk at me. "This is an employment contract. By signing it you agree to work for the company for a minimum of three years following your graduation. In return, the company will pick up the cost of your education." 

 It was a no brainer. I was living at home with my parents and had almost zip for living expenses. My wages had all gone for tuition and books and to keep my clunker of a car running. By signing the contract the money from the 24 hours worked would become spending money and as I reached for a pen to sign I was already thinking of what I could spend it on. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Signing that contract had some far-reaching consequences that had nothing to do with the educational aspects. In all large companies there exists a certain class of people who are determined to climb the corporate ladder by any means necessary. They back stabbed, curried favor, took credit for the work of others and kissed a ton of ass. Ronald Sheets was one of those people. Ron had a leg up on the competition by virtue of marrying the bosses' daughter, but Ron was still always on the look out for ways to make points. Somehow he found out about his father in law's interest in me and decided that a good way to curry favor with dad would be to 'discover' me himself. One day he showed up on the shop floor during my shift and stopped to talk to me. 

 "How's it going Ryan?" 

 "Pretty good Mr. Sheets." 

 "Keeping the old grade point up?" 

 "Hacking away at it sir." 

 "You know Ryan, I can relate to where you are right now, I've done it myself, and I can tell you from experience that all work, all study, and no play can be a drag. I'm having a party at my house this weekend and I want you to come. Hell, I'll do better than that - make it a command appearance - be there Ryan. I'll have my secretary bring you a map on how to get there. Totally casual, you can come any way you want except naked. See you then" and he walked away. 

 Ron was known throughout the company as a back stabbing, ass kissing butt fuck and under normal conditions I would avoid him like the plague - not wanting to get tarred with the same brush - but circumstances were not normal. Ron collected classic cars and he had several that I wanted to see. I figured I'd drop by, check out the cars and then beat feet. 

 I showed up at the party about an hour after it was scheduled to start and the first person I saw was Ron's sixteen-year-old daughter Mellisa. We'd never met, but I knew who she was. Her picture was in the paper often enough. Occasionally on the society page, but more often than not following some run in with the authorities. Driving under the influence, running naked through the fountain at City Park, smoking a joint out behind the high school or something of that nature. She was a spoiled rotten, headstrong and willful girl and her reputation preceded her everywhere she went. You would never think it to look at her. She had the face of an Angel. She looked like innocence personified, but you knew from her reputation that her appearance lied. 

 I walked into the party and Mellisa saw me and came over to me and said, "Who are you and what are you doing here?" 

 "My name is Ryan and I'm here because your father invited me." 

 "You don't belong here; you should leave." 

 For some reason that struck me as funny and I laughed at her and said, "Go play with your dollies little girl" and I walked away from her and went looking for her father. I didn't know it at the time, but the "little girl" part had stung Mellisa and that just wasn't something that she was not at all used to. 

 I was in the garage area practically drooling over a perfectly restored Candy Apple Red 1934 Ford 3 Window Coupe when Mellisa came up behind me. 

 "Hey you!" and I turned to face her. She pulled her top up and exposed her bra less 36D tits and said, "This look like a little girl to you?" 

 Ordinarily I would have stopped drooling over the Coupe and started drooling over Mellisa, but for some reason she had pissed me off with her "You don't belong here" comment. I looked from the left one to the right one and then I said, "Yep, you're about ready for a training bra. Go talk to your mom and she can probably help you pick out one" and I walked away and left her standing there. 

 I was getting ready to leave when Ron caught me and said, "Ryan, I have some one I want you to meet." He steered me to a tall, imposing man and said, "Ryan, this is Mr. Banks." Mr. Banks extended his hand and I shook it as Ron said, "Ryan is going to be one of our up and comers dad." Banks looked from me to Ron and I saw that Ron didn't fool the old man a bit. Over the left shoulder of Mr. Banks I saw Mellisa watching us and probably wondering what the guy "who didn't belong here" was doing with her father and grandfather. Shortly after that I left the party. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next time I saw Mellisa it was at the company picnic. She never approached me, but she was never far away and every time I looked her way she was looking at me. Next was the company Christmas party, but that time she was a little more forward. I avoided her as much as I could, but halfway through the party she came up to me as I was talking to her father and said, "Come on Ryan, this is our dance" and she pulled me out onto the dance floor. 

 "I don't recall committing to a dance with you." 

 "I can't help it if you are stupid." 

 "I'm stupid?" 

 "You must be if you think I'm a little girl. Look around Ryan. I may only be seventeen, but I put half the women here to shame." 

 "You are only sixteen." 

 "No I'm not. I turned seventeen the 9th of last month." 

 "Okay, so you are a couple of months older, you are still a little girl." 

 I hadn't noticed, but we were under the mistletoe and Mellisa stopped dancing, took my head in both hands and gave me a kiss that made my underwear start to smolder. 

 "Tell me that was a little girl kiss asshole" and she stomped off leaving me standing there. 

 I heard some one behind me say, "She doesn't handle rejection well." I turned and saw Mellisa's mother standing there. 

 "What is it with you two?" she asked. 

 "Nothing that I know of." 

 "Nonsense. She is a little wild so I've gotten used to keeping an eye on her. I noticed sparks at the party at our house and at the company picnic she followed your every move. She hasn't taken her eyes off you since you walked in the door and you are trying to tell me that there isn't anything going on?" 

 "Oh there might be something going on, but it isn't what you think." 

 "Oh no? Well then, come and dance with me and tell me all about it." 

 Mellisa's mother, Mary Ellen, was drop dead gorgeous and quite possibly the sexiest woman I'd ever seen in my life and dancing with her was a nightmare. Trying to talk with her while trying to keep my hard on from poking into her leg was a very difficult thing to do and what made it really bad was the bemused smile on Mary Ellen's face that told me that she knew. I explained to her what had happened at the party (omitting the tit show) and Mary Ellen burst out laughing. 

 "You actually called her a little girl and told her to go play with her dolls?" 

 "I'm afraid I did." 

 "No wonder she is after you. You better watch out. She has to prove you wrong now and she will hound you until she does it. Ooh. Look where we are" and she looked up. I followed her glance and saw that we were under the mistletoe again. 

 "Don't look now, but she is watching" and she kissed me. It was a scorcher and when she broke it she said, "That was to thank you for the compliment" and she glanced down at my leg and giggled. "Walk me back to my table young man and remember, watch out for Mellisa." 

 The party wound down and as I was leaving Mellisa came up to me and handed me an envelope. 

 "What's this?" 

 "A Christmas present." 

 I opened it and found a Polaroid of a naked Mellisa wearing a skimpy bikini and a pair of high heels. Luckily I was turned so that she couldn't see the effect that the picture had on me. 

 "Some little girl huh?" she said. 

 I handed the picture back to her and said, "I can't keep this. They have laws against kiddie porn." 

 The look on her face as I walked away was priceless. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Why was I acting that way toward her when she so obviously lit my fire? It had nothing to do with my being pissed over our first encounter and everything to do with my survival. She was wild and unpredictable, had a penchant for getting her picture in the papers - usually for something scandalous - and she was only seventeen. The last thing I needed at that point in my life was to go down in flames with her. If I did what I really wanted to do and things went bad the consequences to me could run anywhere from being fired to going to jail. I had no intention of losing either my best shot at what could be considered a free education or my freedom over a "wild child." 

 The following year brought me in contact with Mellisa a lot more than I would have liked. Shortly after the start of the New Year Mr. Banks passed away and Ron succeeded him as president and CEO of the company. By the time that happened I had come to understand that it had been Mr. Banks who had for some strange reason taken an interest in me and who had arranged my "employment contract". Now he was gone and Ron didn't have to suck up to him and I had to wonder if my circumstances might suddenly change. As the months went by and nothing happened I began to relax a little. 

 Then Mellisa had another run in with the law that made the papers and Ron decided that it was time that she learned to be a little more responsible. When school let out for the summer he made her go to work at the plant and that put her in almost daily contact with me. She dogged me and hovered around me to the point where everyone in the department was getting a good laugh out of it; everyone except me of course. I was even more acutely aware of the potential for disaster and I worked hard at avoiding her, but she worked just as hard at seeing that I couldn't. Just how hard she was working at it became apparent at the company picnic. 

 I was eating a hot dog and watching some guys pitch horse shoes when Mellisa came up to me. She didn't say hi, just tugged at my arm and said, "You need to hurry, they are almost ready to start." 

 "Start what?" 

 "The Three Legged Race." 

 "I didn't sign up for the race." 

 "I know, your partner did it for you." 

 "Don't tell me, let me guess. You?" 

 She smiled at me, "Yep." 

 "Looks like you won't be in the race then." 

 "No? I already told my dad that you and I were going to win. He will be so disappointed. He does so like to see me succeed. I have no idea how he will react when I tell him that you blew me off." 

 Daddy had to be happy with a third place finish, but that wasn't bad when you consider that there were thirty-one couples in the race. Ron came up and gave her a hug and congratulated her and she said, "We'll do better in the Wheel Barrow Race, won't we Ryan?" 

 As Ron walked away I asked, "Do you have any other surprises for me?" 

 "Well, after the barrow race there is the balloon race and after that there is the Wrestle." 

 "The Wrestle? What is that?" 

 "You'll see Ryan, come on, they are lining up for the next race" and she grabbed my hand and pulled me along behind her. 

 We won the barrow race, but we didn't even come close in the Balloon Race, but then I guess Mellisa never intended to try and win. In the Balloon Race a water-filled balloon is placed between two partners, chest to chest, and without using your arms or hands you have to race from the start to the finish without breaking the balloon or letting it hit the ground. The race started and it became immediately apparent to me what Mellisa was up to. What she intended to do was give me a hard time. The race started and we had gone maybe five feet when suddenly Mellisa stepped back and allowed the balloon to begin to fall. Quickly she moved back in and caught the balloon between our stomachs and this put her tits above the balloon and as she pressed forward to trap the balloon her tits pressed into my chest. She had a wicked grin on her face and she said, "I'm not wearing a bra Ryan. Can you feel my nipples touching you?" 

 I probably didn't, but I imagined that I did and I got an instant woodie. We were fifty feet from the finish line and there was no way I was going to be able to go that distance with her tits rubbing my chest so I did the only thing possible - I stepped forward and pushed. The balloon broke and I found out that I'd only made things worse. The water from the balloon soaked Mellisa's shirt and it had the same as if she had been in a "wet T-shirt" contest. 

 "Way to go slick. Why not just pull off my shirt and let everybody look at my tits?" 

 I pulled off my shirt and gave it to her, "Here, cover up. I've got a sweatshirt in my car I can put on." 

 "But if I put it on you won't be able to look at my "little girl" tits." 

 "Jesus Mellisa, you just indicated that you didn't want people looking at them." 

 "People no, you yes." 

 "Why are you messing with me Mellisa?" 

 "Because I can Ryan, simply because I can. Come on, its time for the Wrestle." 

 "Where and what is the Wrestle?" 

 "It's on the other side of the pavilion and you'll see when we get there." 

 I followed her and when we got to the area behind the pavilion there was nothing there. "What's going on Mellisa?" 

 "The Wrestle baby" and she stepped to me, put her arms around me and before I figured out what was happening she had me on the ground. 

 "First fall goes to me" and she laughed as she rolled so she was sitting on me. She leaned forward and put both hands on my shoulders and pressed down. "I got the first pin too" and she lowered her head and kissed me. "None of the other contestants showed so I guess I be the winner. I got the first fall, the first pin, and now I'm going for some riding time" and she reached for my zipper. 

 I exploded up off the ground and dumped Mellisa on her ass. "Jesus Christ, are you fucking nuts? It is broad daylight and your parents, to say nothing of half the company, are on the other side of the fucking building and you are underage. Are you deliberately trying to get me fired or thrown into jail?" 

 I turned and hurried away from her and left the picnic before she could cause me any more grief. 

 Monday when I showed up for work I found my shirt neatly folded and sitting on my desk with a note pinned to it saying that it had been washed and pressed. Mellisa didn't come back to work that summer and I found out later that her mother had taken her to Europe for a month. The next time I saw Mellisa was at the company's annual Christmas party. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 My date for the party came down with the flu and had to cancel out on me so I attended the party alone. I was no sooner in the door when Mellisa saw me and headed my way. She was a vision and I felt my cock stir at the sight of her. She was also trouble and I began looking for a place to go that would keep her away from me. I spotted three guys I knew sitting at a table for four and I started to head their way when Mellisa got to me and took my arm. 

 "How does it feel to be trapped Ryan?" 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "My parents asked me why I didn't have a date for this party and I told them that I did and that he was going to meet me here. I gambled that you would come alone and when you came in the I said, "Oh, here he is now." You can walk away from me if you want Ryan, but then I'll have to tearfully run back to mommy and daddy and tell them how cruel you were to me. Would you like that Ryan? Would you like for my daddy to be really, really pissed at you?" 

 I stood there too flabbergasted to speak and she giggled and said, "I thought not. Come along sweetie, we are sitting at the head table" and she took my arm and pulled me along behind her. 

 I knew everyone at the table so no introductions were necessary and the dinner part of the party passed by with nothing more than general conversation. Following dinner there were a few rah-rah type speeches made and then the band set up and started playing. Mellisa grabbed my hand, "Come on sweetie, let's dance." 

 Out on the dance floor I said, "Sweetie? What's up with that?" 

 "Just staking my claim sweetie." 

 "You might have some trouble selling that to Sally." 

 "And just who is Sally?" 

 "My girlfriend." 

 "You mean your ex-girlfriend." 

 "No I don't." 

 "Sure you do. I already told my dad that we are going steady and he thinks we make a lovely couple." 

 "Why are you doing this to me Mellisa?" 

 "I already answered that at the picnic Ryan, because I can." 

 "That still doesn't give me a good answer. If I accept that you are doing it just because you can, it still doesn't tell me why you want to." 

 "I'll answer that for you before the night is over, but for now, let's just dance." 

 She moved in close to me and then suddenly pulled back in faked shock surprise and said in an equally faked Southern accent, "Well I do declare Ryan sweetie, it seems that not all of you thinks of me as a little girl" and then she moved back in close and ground herself into my erection. She kept me on the floor until the band took a break and then we went back to our table were we sat and engaged in more general conversation. Mellisa excused herself to go to the ladies room and the band came back while she was gone. Mary Ellen said, "You haven't danced with me yet Ryan. Let's get out there and see if we can make your girl friend jealous." Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Mellisa, Mary Ellen and Me Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© As we danced Mary Ellen gave me a bemused smile and said, "And just how long have you been dating the 'little girl' Ryan?" 

 "Since I walked in the door tonight." 

 "Not your choice I take it?" 

 "Nope. I was informed that I was her date and that it might upset daddy if I were to break her poor little heart." 

 "That's true enough. She is the apple of his eye and she does have him wrapped around her little finger. I warned you last Christmas to look out for her. Well, she's back at the table and looking daggers at us so I guess we should head on back, but not before we tweak her nose a bit. Get me under the mistletoe Ryan." 

 I did and she gave me a kiss every bit as steamy as the one she had given me last Christmas and then we went back to the table. Mellisa hauled me right back out onto the dance floor. 

 "It's a good thing that daddy didn't see that kiss. He really gets jealous where mom is concerned." 

 "Hey, she kissed me, I only returned it." 

 "Well it pissed me off. You're my date and you haven't taken me under the mistletoe yet." 

 "I am not your date." 

 "Of course you are. Just go ask my dad." 

 "Jesus Mellisa, why won't you just let me be?" 

 "Because you pissed me off Ryan. You called me a little girl, told me to go and play with my dolls and I going to keep after you until you take it back." 

 "Okay. I take it back; you are not a little girl." 

 "Oh no Ryan, words like that don't mean shit. You have to say it and then prove to me that you mean it." 

 "How am I supposed to do that?" 

 "I'm glad you asked. Come on outside for some fresh air and I'll tell you." 

 Once outside I said, "Okay Mellisa, just what do I have to do?" 

 "Simple enough Ryan. You can either fuck me or eat my pussy.' 

 "Get serious Mellisa." 

 "I am serious Ryan. I want you to prove to me that you don't think of me as a little girl and that's the way you are going to have to do it." 

 "Come on Mellisa, I give up, I surrender, you win. You are not a little girl and we both know it. Let's get back to the party." 

 "No Ryan. I'm going to be all over you like white on rice until you either eat me or fuck me. I'll use my father as a club and the only way you will be able to get away is to quit your job and all that will do is get you away from my father. I'll still find other ways to haunt you. Come on Ryan, your back seat or mine." 

 "Sorry Mellisa, but you're jailbait and I like my freedom too much." 

 "Bullshit Ryan, I was eighteen last month and I'm totally legal." 

 "Okay then, truth time Mellisa. I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole. With your reputation and the way you run around God only knows who you have been with, what they might have given you, and what you might be carrying. I do know that I do not want to chance catching any of it." 

 Mellisa looked at me and I saw a sadness cross her face. 

 "That was cold!" 

 "Why? What did you expect that your outrageous behavior would make people think? Little Miss Wild Child, always running around and getting in trouble, always sticking out your tongue at authority. Did you really expect that it would be ignored?" 

 She was silent for the better part of a minute and then she said, "I'm a virgin Ryan." 

 "Oh come on. Surely you don't expect me to believe that? Not with your reputation." 

 "It's true Ryan. The only way to prove it to you is for you to do it to me, but it is true." 

 "Come on Mellisa. Even if it is true, why me? Why not save it for some one who counts?" 

 "Because you are different. My dad ignores me, calls me his little princess and lets me do what ever I want. Mom says I'm going through a phase and that I'll get over it and so she lets me do what I want. Everyone else falls all over themselves to do what I want them to do or they do what they think I'll like. No one ever says no to me. I've gotten used to that being the way of things. Then here you come along, insult me, ignore me, and in general grab my interest. I started chasing you to rub your nose in the fact that I was not a little girl and the more I pushed you, the more you ignored me. Add to that the fact that I decided a long time ago to get rid of my virginity when I turned eighteen and here we are - the proverbial two birds with one stone - I get rid of my virginity and you admit I'm not a little girl." 

 "Right. And then your dad cans me when he figures it out." 

 "How can he do that? Figure it out I mean?" 

 "You said it yourself. You are his little princess. You think he doesn't keep an eye on you? You think he didn't see us leave? When we aren't back in a reasonable time you think he won't wonder why? You think you won't be under a microscope when you go back in while he looks for the least little thing that will tell him what we were doing out here? Hell Mellisa, he's just as likely to fire me because he's suspicious as for any other reason." 

 "I don't hear you arguing against it, just against doing it here and now. Well then, we will just have to do it tomorrow. Pick me up at six and we will go out on a date and sometime before you take me home it will happen, okay?" 

 I was not used to such matter of fact behavior from the females I knew, but Mellisa did give me a hard on anytime she came within fifty feet of me and so I shrugged and said, "Okay Mellisa, if you are sure that is what you want we might as well give it a try." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next night put an end to my relationship with Sally. I took Mellisa out for burgers and then to a movie and before the night was over we did get it done. Not a big believer in back seat sex I had stopped on the way to pick Mellisa up and rented a motel room. Pulling into the motel parking lot after the movie Mellisa's eyes got big and she said, "You are going to do it, you really are going to do it. I just knew that you would find another excuse to put me off, but you aren't are you? You're really are going to do it." 

 "Well, to be absolutely honest I guessed you would be the one to call it off when I called your bluff." 

 "Bluff? Oh no sweetie, no bluff. Come on, let's get to the room." 

 Mellisa was indeed a virgin and we left the proof of that on the motel sheets. Mellisa surprised me by showing that she had a considerate side to her. Before we left the room she pulled the sheets off the bed and put them in the bathtub to soak, "Maybe it will keep the stain from setting." Mellisa might have been experiencing sex for the first time, but she was determined to experience as much as she could. We did everything but anal and almost all of it three times. Her first blow job wasn't all that great, but by the third one she was getting the hang of it. She didn't have an orgasm the first time we made love, but she did have one the first time I ate her pussy and she did have one the second time we made love. Her favorite positions were doggie or her on top. But what really set her off was oral sex. The more I ate her pussy the more she wanted me too and the fact that I did it when she had my cum in her drove her absolutely wild. 

 The ride home was silent. Mellisa looked out the passenger side window the entire ride home and I couldn't help but wonder what she was thinking. I pulled up in front of her house, but she made no move to get out. Finally I asked her if there was something wrong. She turned to me and I noticed that there was a tear in her eye. 

 "You know that you never even kissed me? All the things we did tonight and you never kissed me, not once." 

 "As I recall you were too busy dragging me out of the car and into the motel room to waste time on the preliminaries." 

 "Still, you could have found time in there somewhere to kiss me. It just doesn't seem right that a girl loses her virginity and doesn't get kissed." 

 I slid over next to her, took her in my arms and kissed her. It got a little steamy and I was at the point of suggesting we move to the back seat when Mellisa broke the kiss. 

 "I've got to get going. Same time tomorrow?" 

 "I thought that this was just a one time thing to put the "little girl" matter to rest." 

 "Oh no Ryan. I told daddy we were going steady. Besides, we haven't done anal yet. Don't be late" and she got out of the car and headed up the walk to the house. 

 To be continued... Report_Story #1 

 

 ****** Mellisa, Mary Ellen and Me Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© If I had passed on picking up Mellisa the next night at seven my life over the next year would have been a whole lot less stressful, but I picked her up on time and headed for the motel. 

 "What? I don't rate a date of any kind? Just going to haul me to the motel like some kind of round heeled slut?" 

 "Isn't that what you are? You sure have been acting like one." 

 "Still, it isn't very gentlemanly of you to acknowledge the fact." 

 It was a repeat of the first night except that this time Mellisa wanted to try anal. I took my time and used plenty of KY Jelly and then I eased myself into her tight ass. She had her head buried in a pillow and I saw her hands clutching the bed sheets tightly, but she never made a sound the whole time I stroked into her pooper. When it was over she asked me if I had liked it and I told her that any way I could get off was enjoyable. 

 "Well I didn't like it and I hope that you can do without it in the future because I don't want to do it again." 

 "Your choice sweetie. It is your body and you get to decide what to do with it." 

 "Everything else we did last night I loved. Go wash off your cock so we can fuck and then you can eat my pussy." 

 It turned out that her favorite thing was for me to eat her pussy after I had cum in her. We screwed four times that night and she had me eat her pussy after every time. I started thinking that the only reason we fucked was so she could have me eat her. When I took her home and she said, "Same time tomorrow?" I told her no. 

 "I have a couple of school projects that I have to turn in as soon as Christmas break is over and I need to spend some time working on them." 

 "So when will I see you again?" 

 "How about Friday?" 

 "Friday? But that's four days away. It isn't fair Ryan. You got me started and it is up to you to see that I get what I need." 

 "Sorry Mellisa, but my plans for Christmas break didn't factor in what has happened with you. Plus I have Sally to think about." 

 "Your ex-girlfriend?" 

 "That's the problem Mellisa, she doesn't know that yet and I'm not asshole enough to let her find out by some other means. I have to break it off in person." 

 "You sure about that? Because I'm not sharing you with anyone else Ryan. I want all you have and I don't intend to leave you with enough energy to take care of anyone else." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Thus began what proved to be the most turbulent year of my life. Between work, school and Mellisa all my time was pretty much eaten up. What with my class load and my job I was only able to see Mellisa twice during the week and then on Saturday and Sunday. Mellisa didn't want to go to a movie, didn't want to go dancing, didn't want to do anything but fuck and it wasn't long before the constant renting of motel rooms was straining my budget. Mellisa and I tried the back seat a couple of times but we both agreed that it was way too uncomfortable and constraining. I sat down and ran some numbers and found that I could rent an efficiency apartment for half of what I was paying for motel rooms so I went out and found one close to school. 

 My big mistake was to give Mellisa a key. It got to where I would come home from class and find her naked on my bed and waiting for me. My grades began to suffer because I was spending more time in Mellisa than in a book. Finally I had to take the key away from her and tell her I would only see her on Monday and Thursday and weekends. She got pissed at me and I didn't see her for two weeks. Then one Thursday I came home from class and found her sitting on the steps to my apartment. 

 "What brings you here?" 

 "Don't be an ass Ryan. You know damned well why I'm here. Can we go inside or do you want me to go after your cock right here in public." 

 "Grapevine told me that you had a new guy." 

 "What did you expect? You tossed my ass out and I was pissed so I dated another guy." 

 "So why are you here instead of with him?" 

 "He's a jerk. Besides, he won't eat pussy." 

 "So I'm just a fuck toy for you?" 

 "Works for me. Come on Ryan, let's go inside and play." 

 She wanted to be eaten first and I was surprised to find out that she was very wet and I commented on it. 

 "What do you expect? You get me used to damned near every day and then you cut me off. All I've thought about for two weeks is getting laid and that made me horny and horny makes me wet." 

 "I thought you were getting it on with the other guy." 

 "He wanted to and I would have, but he told me he wouldn't eat me and I told him that was the price of admission and he didn't want to pay it. So it's up to you sweetie, eat me baby, give me what I love." 

 We got back on our Monday, Thursday, weekend schedule, but I noticed a slight change in Mellisa. It seemed like the more she got, the more she wanted. She was always horny and as a consequence she was always sopping wet when we got together. I suppose that if I'd had more free time I might have figured it out, but a full class load, my job, time spent doing homework and class assignments and time spent with Mellisa didn't leave me with a whole lot of time to sit around and speculate. 

 I found out the truth the day I was blackmailed. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was a Saturday and I arrived at Mellisa's house to pick her up for a date. Mary Ellen invited me in and told me that Mellisa wasn't there. 

 "She went to the mall and she just called and said she was running about an hour late." 

 "Okay, I guess I'll come back in an hour." 

 "No Ryan, I want you to stay. In fact I'm glad she's running late because it gives me a chance to find out about something I've been curious about." 

 "What's that?" 

 "Oral sex." 

 "Excuse me?" 

 "Oral sex. You know Ryan, sucking cock and eating pussy." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "Sure you do Ryan. Mellisa was talking to one of her girlfriends on the phone the other day. She didn't know that I was home and the conversation got a little raunchy. I didn't know you had such a kinky side Ryan. The part that grabbed my attention was where she told her friend how much she got off when you eat her pussy." 

 She stood up and started undressing and as she stripped she said, "I'm forty years old Ryan and do you know that I've never had my pussy eaten? Not once. My husband thinks that oral sex is perverted and disgusting, but I've always wanted to try it. I've never wanted it bad enough to risk my marriage by going out and picking up guys until I found one who would eat me, but I don't have to go looking now, do I? You are right here." 

 "I don't think that this is a good idea Mrs. Sheets. Maybe I'd just better leave." 

 "Nonsense Ryan, this is a great idea. I finally get what I want and you avoid a whole mess of possible problems." 

 "Pardon me?" 

 "Well Ryan, just imagine what might happen if my husband were to find out that not only were you screwing his little princess, but you were also doing things to her that are so perverted that he won't even do them with his own wife. Besides sugar, it shouldn't be that much of a chore for you. I've seen you looking at me and twice I've danced with you and felt your hard cock poking into me. Come on sugar, show Mary Ellen what she's been missing all these years." 

 You would think that I would jump at the chance to do something - anything - with Mary Ellen, but I was getting just a little bit tired of the women in that family beating me over the head with Ron. I was right on the edge of standing up and saying, "Sorry Mrs. Sheets, but I wouldn't feel right doing something like that with my girlfriends mom." Then I thought about the nine months to go until graduation. So close to being done - too close to blow it at that late date. 

 "How do we keep from getting caught by Ron or Mellisa?" 

 "Ron left an hour ago to go play golf and he will be gone at least four hours. We have an hour before Mellisa gets home so let's not waste any more time talking sugar." 

 I should have known that something was wrong when she lay down, spread her legs and said, "Hurry sugar, before it all leaks out," but the words flew right past me. I was so busy admiring Mary Ellen's superb body that I had my mouth on her pussy and was licking away before the "it all leaks out" registered. I started to pull my head away from Mary Ellen's pussy, but she cried out, "No sugar, keep eating me, please don't stop" and she dug her fingers in my hair and held me to her. She started pushing her muff up at me and I found the little man in the boat and went after him. She screamed and had an orgasm and I stayed after her clit until she started moaning again and then I pulled away from her. 

 "Don't stop, please sugar, don't stop." 

 I stood up and started taking off my pants and she said, "What are you doing. Oh no sugar, you can't fuck me. I've never been unfaithful to Ron." 

 "What do you call what we have just been doing?" 

 "It isn't cheating if it is something he won't do for me." 

 "Oh, so you get your jollies and I get to suffer?" 

 "If I suck your cock will that do?" 

 "That would be just fine." 

 "You will have to tell me what to do. When I said that Ron did not believe in oral sex I meant it both ways. I've never sucked a cock." 

 I had to smile at that and she asked me what was so funny. I couldn't very well tell her the truth - that mother and daughter both got their first taste of cock from me - so I said, "What's funny is that you are blackmailing me into doing something that most guys my age would give their right arm to be doing." 

 "It isn't blackmail sweetie; you wanted me, you just needed a little push. Now please go back to eating my pussy, please sugar, I really, really like it." 

 "When do I get my blow job?" 

 "Make me cum once more and then I'll do it." 

 "What did you mean when you said, Hurry, before it all leaks out?" 

 "Ron made love to me before he went to play golf." 

 "You had me go down on you after Ron had cum in you?" 

 "Of course sugar, isn't that what you like?" 

 "Why in God's name would you think I liked it?" 

 "Because that's what Mellisa was telling her friend on the phone. She said you ate her pussy after she had fucked someone else. She said you do it every time you get together. She gets laid, comes to you, you eat her out and then spend the rest of the evening fucking like bunnies." 

 "Mellisa said that?" 

 I saw it register on her face and she said, "You didn't know?" 

 "No, I didn't know." 

 "Oh dear, I think I may just have fucked it up for all of us.' 

 "I guess you just did." 

 "Does this mean you won't eat my pussy any more?" 

 I looked at the sexy woman spread out before me and I thought, "What the hell, it hasn't killed me yet and I might never have an opportunity like this again." So I said, "I'll tell you what Mary Ellen. If you can get me off and there is still enough time for me to eat you again before Mellisa gets home I will. But I want something from you first." 

 "What?" 

 "The name of the girl who Mellisa was talking to." 

 "I don't have it. I only heard her side of the conversation and I only caught the middle of it. Why do you need it?" 

 "Because Mellisa and I are about to part company and I can't very well tell her that it is because of information that I got from you." 

 "Why are you breaking it off with her. According to Mellisa you two have a great sex life. Whatever she's done hasn't bothered you until now." 

 "Before I didn't know; now I do and it bothers the hell out of me." 

 "I looked at my watch, "You had better hurry if you want me to do you again." 

 Mary Ellen was hopelessly inept at giving head. She, like Mellisa, could probably get better with time, but she wasn't getting the job done that day and I told her so. 

 "I'll give you a hand job then sugar, I will get you off." 

 "I can give myself hand jobs Mary Ellen" and I got started to get up and get my clothes. 

 "No, please sugar, no. Stay and eat my pussy, please?" 

 "I'm sorry Mary Ellen, but I need to get some relief and since I'm going to have to do it myself I'm going home to do it." 

 "No sugar, please stay" but I ignored her and started to get up. 

 "No!" she cried, "Damn it no. I'll get you off" and she pulled me down, swung over me and impaled herself on my cock. She began sliding up and down all the while moaning, "Hurry sugar, hurry up and cum. Cum for me sugar, hurry up and cum for me. Get off so you can eat me baby, please sugar, hurry." 

 I rolled her on her back and began pounding her as hard as I could. Her legs locked around me and her finger nails bit deep into my back and it only took minutes until the cum started boiling up from my balls and splashed Mary Ellen's insides. I leaned over her, breathing hard while my cock softened in her pussy and then she began pushing me away from her. 

 "Hurry sugar, hurry. Eat me baby, please eat me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was lying on her living room floor, still naked, watching me dress. "Can we do this again Ryan?" 

 "You really want to?" 

 "Oh God yes, yes I do." 

 "What about the being unfaithful to Ron part?" 

 "Fuck him. He had his chance and would never do it. I'll still fuck his brains out, but I'm going to look to you for oral sex and I'll pay for it any way I have to, okay?" 

 "I don't know Mary Ellen. My apartment won't be safe for us if Mellisa decides to hang around. I can't afford motels and I don't like back seats. Because of Ron and Mellisa it wouldn't be safe here, so how would we do it?" 

 "Maybe you can't afford motels Ryan, but I can." She giggled and then said, "Would you like being a kept man Ryan? Would it turn you on to have a forty year old woman paying so that you could have sex with her?" 

 "I suppose it would." 

 "When sugar? When can we do it?" 

 "As soon as I'm done talking to Mellisa I'll have Mondays, Thursdays and weekends free." 

 "You are really going to drop her?" 

 "Like a hot coal. In fact I'm going to leave now. When she gets home tell I was here and left. You can even tell her that I wasn't in a very good mood when I got here and let her think about that while she tries to find me." 

 As I was leaving Mary Ellen handed me a piece of paper, "That's my cell phone number. Call me Monday and I'll let you know where to meet me." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was in my apartment fixing myself dinner when the doorbell rang. I opened the door to find a pissed off Mellisa standing there. She pushed past me into the apartment and said, "Where were you? I told mom to have you wait." 

 "Didn't feel like waiting. I was there on time, you weren't, I left. I was only there to tell you to fuck off anyway so I didn't see any sense in waiting. I figured I see you sooner or later and I could tell you then." 

 "Tell me to fuck off?" 

 "Yeah sweetie, I found out about the little game you have been playing on me and I didn't like it." 

 "Game? What game?" 

 "Don't play dumb Mellisa. You know damned well what game. Getting yourself fucked by some guy and then rushing over to see me and having me eat him out of you and all the while telling me that you were so wet because you were horny for me." 

 She looked away from me and said, "Honestly Ryan, I don't know what you are talking about." 

 What the hell, if she could lie so could I. "I'm talking about the guy who swaggered up to me at the mall today and asked me how I liked being a cock sucker by proxy. When I asked him what the fuck he was talking about he said he just wondered how I liked eating you out after he fucked you. I told him he was full of shit and he said, "No way dude. Every Monday and Thursday I lay the pipe to her before she comes by your apartment." 

 "That's not true Ryan, I...." 

 I cut here off, "Just get out Mellisa" and I took her by the arm and led her to the door, opened it and pushed her outside. She turned and tried to come back in, but I blocked the door. 

 "Please Ryan, don't do this to me." 

 The last thing I heard as I slammed the door in her face was, "Damn it Ryan, I love you, please don't do this to me." 

 I almost opened the door back to ask her what she'd said. I love you? She had never uttered those words to me before, but then I thought, so what, and went back to fixing my dinner. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the next six weeks Mellisa hung around my apartment. When I pulled onto the parking lot I just turned around and left if I saw her car or saw her sitting on my steps. If I didn't see her until it was too late I just pushed past her and slammed my apartment door in her face. I couldn't avoid her at work, but I could ignore her and I did. The mantra was always the same; "Please talk to me Ryan, just talk to me. I know we can work things out Ryan, I just know we can. Please Ryan, I love you, talk to me." 

 During that same six weeks I was meeting her mother at motels. Mary Ellen got to be pretty good at giving blow jobs, but what she wanted most was for me to eat her pussy and it almost always had Ron's cum in it. Unlike her daughter Mary Ellen didn't try to trick me and she was always very up front about it. She always told me as soon as we were in the motel room if Ron had been there first. 

 "I go crazy when you eat my pussy baby, but I go absolutely starkers when you do it after Ron has fucked me. I have more and bigger orgasms and I hope to God you never stop giving them to me." 

 One night when we were in a sixty-nine her butt hole look really appealing so while I was sucking on her clit I pushed a finger in her ass and she moaned. I worked it around a little and she stopped sucking my cock and asked, "What are you doing?" 

 "Playing with your butt." 

 "That's nasty." 

 "I'm a nasty guy. Haven't you ever had anal sex?" 

 "Good lord no." 

 "Why not?" 

 "It's nasty and perverted." 

 "You said that about oral sex, but it sure didn't take you long to change your mind." 

 "No, Ron said oral sex was perverted." 

 "Well, he was wrong about that so how do you know that you aren't?" 

 "Have you done it often?" 

 "Quite a lot." 

 "Let me think about it for a while." 

 She loved it! She got to the point where she had a hard time making up her mind what she wanted to do first when we got together - get her butt fucked or her pussy eaten. I was in hog heaven. I was getting all the sex I could handle from a super sexy woman who spoiled me rotten. She even made me feel like a gigolo. My car was a ten year old clunker and one night I missed meeting her at the motel because the car broke down. When I called her and cancelled and told her why she was upset. Just how upset I found out the next time we got together. When we were through taking each other through the wringer and I was getting dressed to leave she took some keys out of her purse and tossed them to me. 

 "What's this?" 

 "The keys to your new car. I don't want you to ever miss another one of MY nights because of car trouble." 

 "New car?" 

 "Well, not brand new, that might have caused talk given your financial situation, but it is only two years old and I had it gone completely through to make sure you won't have any problems with it. It's the green one just outside parked next to mine." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 My grades were coming back up because Mary Ellen didn't take up near as much of my time as Mellisa had. After all, she did have a husband she had to keep happy. Strange as it seemed to me then, given that she was fucking my eyes out, she said that she loved Ron to death and didn't want to lose him. 

 "If he ever decides to try oral sex sugar I'd never see you again. I'd miss you, but I'd never leave home if Ron would take care of me." 

 Then came the day I had been expecting ever since my breakup with Mellisa. I had practiced my speech and I was ready. Ron asked me to stop by his office after work. After the niceties were out of the way he said, "Mellisa tells me that you broke up with her." Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Mellisa, Mary Ellen and Me Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Yes sir, I did." 

 Mind telling me why?" 

 "It was a matter of class sir, for lack of a better way of putting it." 

 "Could you explain that please?" 

 "Well sir, Mellisa and I are from two different worlds. I'm a hamburger guy and she's a steak lady. She is meant for better things and I know it. I knew that she could never get what she deserved from me. I knew that you and your wife expect better for her and so I took myself out of the picture." 

 "That's what I've always liked about you Ryan. You are a clear headed young man and you see things the way they are. You are absolutely right in your thinking, not that you aren't good enough for Mellisa, but in that her mother and I do have some rather high hopes for her. I think that getting tied down at her age could be disastrous. But your breaking up with her has presented me with a problem that I need your help to solve." 

 "Sir?" 

 "Mellisa is broken hearted Ryan. She has been an absolute mess since your breakup. She's my baby Ryan and it distresses me to see her in her current condition." 

 "I don't know what to say Mr. Sheets." 

 "I'd like you to do me a big favor Ryan. I'd like for you to get back together with Mellisa." 

 "Sir, I don't thi...' 

 "Hear me out Ryan. You were right in your initial assessment and you did what you thought was right. I want you to do it again, only differently." 

 "Sir?" 

 "Get back together Ryan. Make it work for a month or so and then do some thing that will make Mellisa break up with you. Make her want to hate you for the rest of her life. Make her want to put you completely out of her mind for good. I need you to be the bad guy for me Ryan. I need for Mellisa to get over you and focus her energies elsewhere. Can you do this for me son?" 

 Three months to graduation and I'm going to say no? Still, I wasn't na‹ve so I said, "What happens when I do this and she comes crying to you and tells you that I've been mean to her and that you should fire me? I mean we both know that she usually gets her way with you." 

 "You are doing this for me Ryan and I don't forget my friends. I'll just have to say no and be firm about it." 

 Yeah, right, I thought, but out loud I said, "Okay, but it will take some time to do it right. I'll have to make it look good, I can't just rush to her and say I was wrong and I'm back. It will be a gradual thing, but it will look right" and burn up a good part of those three months to graduation. Tuition and books were already paid for and I didn't need to sweat that, but I did need my wages for the next three months so I'd have a cushion if I had to go job hunting. 

 Ron smiled, stood up and offered me his hand. "Good man. You won't regret this Ryan. I take care of my friends." 

 To be continued... Report_Story #1 

 

 ****** Mellisa, Mary Ellen and Me Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I debated keeping my conversation with Ron a secret from Mary Ellen, but there wasn't anyway that I could keep my getting back with Mellisa from her. She would be curious as to why and I knew her well enough to know that she would stay after me until I told her so best do it up front and get it out of the way. 

 "Why in the world would you let him push you into that? You can't possibly be that hard up for a job. So he fires you, so what? You're young, you're smart, you could always find something else." 

 "Not like what I have now" and I explained the deal to her. 

 "I never knew that and I know almost all that goes on at the company. I own it. Did you know that? I own fifty-four percent of the company's stock and Ron sits as president and CEO because of me." 

 "Well, it was your father's deal and I've been walking on eggshells since he passed away. Not a day goes by when I don't think I'll be called in and told that the deal is cancelled. That's why I caved when you threatened me with Ron and that's why Mellisa always got away with what she did - she was always using daddy as a club." 

 "So what are you going to do?" 

 "Try to keep everyone happy until I graduate." 

 "What then?" 

 "I don't know, but at least I'll have options." 

 "So, you are only here with me to keep your job?" 

 "Don't be silly. I'll still be here with you ten years from now if you want, job or no job, but to keep things in perspective here, let us not forget that it was you threatening me with Ron that got us here." 

 Mary Ellen had the good grace to blush and say nothing. She just smiled and undressed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Mellisa was still loitering around and I ignored her for another two weeks and then one evening when I found her on my apartment steps I asked, "Just what is it going to take to get rid of you Mellisa?" 

 "You can't Ryan. I plan to be around for the rest of your life, either with you or just haunting you." 

 "Why Mellisa? Just what is so special about me that you can't leave me alone?" 

 "I love you Ryan. I don't know when it happened, but it did and I want to be with you." 

 "Bullshit Mellisa. If you loved me you would never have pulled that stupid, sick little game of yours on me." 

 "Haven't you ever screwed up Ryan? Haven't you ever done something that you wished to God you could undo, but couldn't? I fucked up. At the time I thought it was great. I had you and I was having the most mind-blowing orgasms and I wanted it to go on forever. Can we go inside and talk Ryan?" 

 "No Mellisa, I've got things I need to do tonight. If you want to talk you can meet me at the Student Union on Friday after my three o'clock class. I should be there about four-ten." 

 "Can't we talk in private?" 

 "No Mellisa, I don't want to be anywhere alone with you" and it gets me three more days closer to graduation. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next Thursday Mary Ellen reduced me to jelly before asking, "How's it coming with Mellisa?" 

 "I've agreed to talk with her." 

 "And then?" 

 "I'll agree to start dating her to see if we can put it back together again and I'll string it out as long as I can." 

 "You going to make love to her?" 

 "It may come to that." 

 "This is ridiculous. She's my daughter and my natural inclination is to be protective of her and knowing what you are going to do to her pisses me off. On the other hand I'm possessive of you and I don't want to share you with her. How fucked up is that?" 

 "Hey, you are the major stock holder in the company. Guarantee my job and I won't have to do any of it." 

 "You know I can't do that. Ron would be all over me wanting to know what was going on." 

 "Yeah, I know. Besides, it may not come to our having sex. The plan is to get her so pissed off that she breaks us up. Maybe it will happen before we get to the sex part." 

 "Try to make it happen sweetie, try real hard. Speaking of hard, any chance for one more time?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Mellisa was sitting at a table waiting for me when I arrived at the Student Union on Friday. I sat down, "Okay Mellisa, go ahead, it's your meeting." 

 "Please Ryan, can't we go somewhere more private?" 

 "No Mellisa. You're wasting time. You wanted to talk, so talk or I'll be going." 

 "Why are you being so hard Ryan?" 

 "After what you did to me Mellisa I don't owe you a thing. You are lucky I even agreed to let you talk to me, so talk." 

 "Ryan, I'm sorry. I'll do anything to make it up to you, but I need you Ryan. I love you and I'm miserable without you. Please Ryan, can't we get back together?" 

 "Why should we Mellisa? I don't know why you did what you did in the first place so why would I trust you not to do it again?" 

 "It was a mistake Ryan. It was accidental the first time, but it was so damned good that I had to try it again." 

 "Explain that if you can." 

 "When you took away my key I was pissed. "Fuck him" I said to my self, "I don't need his sorry ass." So I went out with several other guys and I slept with two of them. It was okay, but it was no where near as satisfying as what you and I had. The day I came back to your apartment I had just slept with one of them. When it was over I asked myself why I was fucking around with losers when what I really wanted was to be with you. I went to your apartment to talk to you, to try and put us back together the way we were. I didn't intend to sleep with you that day, honest to God Ryan, I did not intend to, but we ended up in bed. When you ate my pussy with Donny's cum still in me I had the most mind-blowing orgasm of my life and I wanted to experience it again. I didn't know if it was caused by the fact that you were licking up Donny's stuff or if it was because I was so happy to be back with you. The next time you ate me it was good and I did have a small orgasm, but not a mind blowing one so I got curious. I got laid by another guy and then came to you. You ate my pussy and it sent me to the moon. I know that it was all mental Ryan, but it was so fantastic. I wanted both Ryan, I wanted you and I wanted those spectacular orgasms, but the only way I could get them was to get laid by somebody else before coming to you. The guys didn't mean shit to me Ryan; all they did was give me what I needed so you could make me see stars with your mouth. It was wrong and I knew it, but it didn't seem to bother you and it did so much for me that I convinced myself that it would be okay because you would never find out. But then you did find out and walked away from me and I died inside. When we started out Ryan I was just fucking with you over that "little girl" shit, but somewhere along the way I fell in love with you and I can't bear not being with you." 

 "That's what you say, but do you want my take on it Mellisa? You are a spoiled brat and you have always gotten what you wanted. No one has ever said no to you until I did and it is killing you. That sort of thing is just not supposed to happen to Mellisa. No Mellisa, the way I see it is that you want us to get back together so you can end it on your terms, not mine." 

 "You are wrong Ryan. I swear to God that if I get you back dynamite won't be able to separate us." 

 "I don't know Mellisa. In the first place I'm not sure that I could ever trust you again. In the second place I'm seeing someone right now and the question is why should I drop her for you, but third and most important is that I don't ever recall telling you that I love you. The only reason we got together was because you browbeat me with your father and what he could do to me and my job. Given that, why should your telling me that you love me mean anything?" 

 "You love me Ryan. You may not have gotten around to realizing it yet, but you do. I could tell from the way you held me and the way you touched. Come on Ryan, give us a chance. Please?" 

 "I'm in a relationship that I'm comfortable with Mellisa and I just can't see risking it over you." 

 "Do you love her?" 

 "No, but I am very fond of her." 

 "Does she love you?" 

 "No, she's in love with her husband." 

 "She loves her husband, but sleeps with you?" 

 "He doesn't give her enough sex." 

 "So, any day now she could decide to go home to him or he could find out about you and come looking for you with a gun. Sounds to me like what you need is a steady, stable relationship Ryan, and I'm here to offer it to you." 

 "I don't think so Mellisa, I just don't think that it would work." 

 "Okay, how's this? I'll share. That way I'll have a foot in the door when she goes back to hubby." 

 "You are that desperate?" 

 "Yes Ryan, I am that desperate." 

 "Okay Mellisa, I'll think on it." 

 "What's to think on?" 

 "My schedule hasn't changed Mellisa. I'm still balancing work and school and I only have so much free time. The Mondays and Thursdays that you used to have are taken up by my new lady friend." 

 "Does she get away from her hubby on weekends?" 

 "Some, but not often." 

 "Okay, I'll take the weekends then and if she gets free on one of them I'll bite my tongue and step aside. All I want is a chance Ryan. Please, just give me a chance." 

 I looked at her and was quiet for a minute and then I said, "All right Mellisa, this is what I'm willing to do. We never had a relationship as such. All we had was you beating me over the head with your father. This time we do it the normal way. We date and then we see if it goes from there. I'm not doing anything next Friday. Would you like to have dinner and then take in a movie with me?" 

 "Next Friday? But that's a whole week away Ryan." 

 Yes indeed it is, I thought, and one week closer to graduation. "Maybe some other time then" I said as I started to stand up. Mellisa grabbed my arm, "Next Friday is fine Ryan." 

 "Good. I'll pick you up around seven."

 Mary Ellen was sliding up and down on my cock for the third time that night. She had been horny as hell when I got to the motel, "Hurry baby, hurry. He had me twice before I left the house." I was doing my best to stay with her when suddenly she stopped and said, "I don't feel right about this." 

 "Don't feel right about what?" 

 "Doing what I'm doing knowing that tomorrow you will be screwing over my daughter." 

 "No I won't. I'm just going to string her along until graduation and then tell her sorry, it just isn't working." 

 "That will be screwing over her." 

 "Well, she's got it coming from the way she screwed over me. Besides, you know her better than I do so you should know that all I am to her is something she can't have so she just wants it more." 

 "You're right sweetie, I do know her better than you do and I believe her when she says she loves you." 

 "Well I don't love her so it doesn't really matter." 

 "Are you sure about that?" 

 "You had better hope so. Given our current status can you imagine having me around as a son in law?" 

 Mary Ellen giggled at that. "Oh I don't know sweetie, it could have its interesting moments." 

 I rolled her over onto her back and slowly pumped into her, "And who would make out the schedule, you or Mellisa?" 

 "Circumstances would dictate sweetie, now hush up and fuck me." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Although it was obvious that Mellisa expected a little more out of it my date with her was just that, a first date. I picked her up, we had dinner and saw a movie following which I took her home. I walked her to her door, told that I'd had a good time and that I hoped she'd had a good time also and asked her if I could call her in a day or two. 

 "Don't I even get a kiss goodnight?" 

 I bent to kiss her on the cheek, but she turned her head and grabbed mine and then did her best to melt the soles of my shoes. She stepped back and said, "Call. Soon." And then she went inside the house. 

 The next four dates over the next three weeks were basically the same. By the fifth date Mellisa decided that she was through playing around and that she was tired of waiting for me to make a move. Once we were out of sight of the house she slid over next to me and her hands went to my fly. 

 "What the hell are you doing Mellisa?" 

 "Pay attention to your driving Ryan and don't worry about me." 

 Three minutes later she said, "Your apartment, a motel, or the back seat baby, don't matter to me, but I'm not letting go of it." 

 I didn't have enough money for a motel and I didn't want to get Mellisa back in the habit of coming to my apartment so the back seat is where we ended up. And once we got started we didn't stop. It was Mary Ellen every Monday and Thursday and Mellisa every Friday, Saturday and Sunday except for the few weekends that Mary Ellen was able to get loose. Mellisa was as good as her word and she did bite her lip and step aside. I could tell she wasn't happy about it, but she did do it. 

 Given Mary Ellen's feelings on the matter I didn't tell her when Mellisa and I started having sex again so it came as a surprise to me when one Monday she asked, "Are you getting ready to dump the old broad?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I can tell from the way that Mellisa is behaving that you two are making love again. She's happy and almost always in a good mood, but she's a little down in the dumps on Mondays and Thursdays. Does she know about us?" 

 "Only that I told her that I had a new lady in my life and that I saw her on Mondays and Thursdays. I thought that would discourage her, but so far it hasn't." 

 "Back to my original question, are we about to become a thing of the past?" 

 "Of course not. I'm not about to give you up for a spoiled brat." 

 "Why not? You know that I love my husband and that my relationship with you is purely sexual. And you also know I would end the relationship in a heartbeat if my husband would give me anal and oral sex. Besides Ryan, you love that little spoiled brat. Oh you probably won't admit it, but you do. I can tell from the way you look at her and from the way you act around her and I can tell from watching her that she does love you. Eventually you are going to get over what she did and realize how you really feel about her. What then?" 

 "Is this your way of trying to end it between us? Are you getting ready to tell me that you have to get out of the way so Mellisa and I can move forward?" 

 "No way Tiger. I'll still be fucking you after you and Mellisa get married if you will let me." 

 "Well I'm not going to be the one to end it and if you aren't going to it looks as if we will be getting together for a long time to come." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Graduation finally arrived and I went back to working full time at XYZ. Two months after that I was promoted to supervisor. I was still doing the balancing act between Mellisa and Mary Ellen although with school out of the way I did have a lot more free time and I found that I was spending most of it with Mellisa. We were going places and doing things and at a party one night I finally discovered what Mellisa and Mary Ellen seemed to have known all along. 

 I loved the silly bitch! 

 Every time she talked with another guy I got upset. When she danced with one I wanted to kill the asshole. The guys she talked with and danced with obviously wanted her and I wanted to scream at them, "Leave her alone damn it, she's mine!" Driving home after the party Mellisa sensed my mood and asked me what was wrong. 

 "Nothing." 

 "Something is bothering you Ryan, I can tell." 

 "Nothing is bothering me." 

 "Oh yes there is. You were fine before the party and you were okay when we got there so it must have been something that happened during the party." She sat there looking at me and I could see the gears turning in her head and then something clicked and I saw her grin. "My oh my, I do believe that you are jealous Ryan. What's the matter baby? Afraid someone else might want what you have?" 

 "No, of course not, don't be silly." 

 "Sure baby, whatever you say." 

 Our relationship changed after that and we moved closer together. One night Mellisa asked, "When are you going to dump your married girlfriend so that I can have all your time?" 

 I gave her a song and dance about how I was keeping my girlfriend because I still was unsure of how things were going to work out between Mellisa and me. 

 "Bullshit Ryan. You know that I love you and even though you haven't told me I know that you love me. Why don't you stop wasting time and admit it? I don't want to get married until I finish school, but that doesn't mean that I don't want to start making plans." 

 I hemmed and hawed and didn't commit which turned out to be a big mistake as I was to find out two days later. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had my face buried in Mary Ellen's pussy, sucking up two loads that Ron had put in her earlier that day, when there was a pounding on the door. My first thought was that Ron had gotten suspicious and had followed Mary Ellen. Then I found out that it was much, much worse than that. 

 "Open the door Ryan" Mellisa yelled, "I know that you are in there." 

 "Oh shit," said Mary Ellen, "What do we do?" 

 "Nothing. She'll stop and go away if we just sit tight." 

 "Open this door Ryan. I'm not leaving. I'll beat on this fucking door and yell until somebody calls the cops if I have to. Does your girlfriend want her name on a police report? What if some reporter hears the call and follows along? Does the married lady want her picture in the paper?" 

 I told Mary Ellen to get in the bathtub and close the shower curtain and then I answered the door. Mellisa stormed in the door, "Where is she? Since you won't tell her goodbye I'm here to force the issue." 

 "She left just before you got here." 

 "Not even a nice try doofus. I followed you here and no one has come out since you walked in that door. Besides, her purse is over there and her clothes are on the floor." 

 "It doesn't matter Mellisa. You have no business being here and causing me a problem. Things have been moving pretty nice between us, but you are on the ragged edge of fucking up and ending our relationship all over again." 

 "Bullshit Ryan. You're mine and you always will be. I'm through sharing you and I'm here to tell the tramp to get out of your life." 

 She looked around the room and then she went over to the bathtub and jerked open the shower curtain. 

 "Mother! You?!! 

 She turned to me, "You bastard! How could you?" Then she turned to Mary Ellen, "And you, how could you do this to me? You know I love him, you knew he was mine, how could you?" 

 "He wasn't yours when it started Mellisa and I didn't see any reason to give up a good thing when you started seeing each other again. Besides, he didn't think the thing with you was going anywhere so why should I have walked away?" 

 "But daddy, what about daddy?" 

 "What your father doesn't know won't hurt him or me." 

 "But why? Daddy absolutely adores you." 

 "Yes he does and I love him just as much as I always have, but there are certain things I need that your father just won't do for me." 

 "Like what?" 

 "Honestly Mellisa, don't you think you are getting a little personal?" 

 "A little personal? I find out that you are fucking the man I love and that's not personal?" 

 "Well, if you must know, your father thinks that certain forms of sex are degenerate and perverted and he won't do them." 

 "What, anal or oral?" 

 "Both." 

 "Oh my God, my boyfriend fucks my mother in her ass. Does he eat your pussy too?" 

 Marry Ellen nodded a yes. 

 "Do you go dow.... Wait a fucking minute here! You see Ryan every Monday and Thursday and I know, because you and dad are so damned noisy, that he makes love to you before he leaves for his club meetings. Is Ryan eating your pussy with daddy's cum still in you?" 

 Mary Ellen shrugged and Mellisa turned to me, "You miserable fucking hypocrite. You dumped me over it, but it is all right for you to do it with my mother? You know how much I loved it and how much it turned me on and you can't do it for me, but you can do it for her?" Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Mellisa, Mary Ellen and Me Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Well, there it was. What Ron and I had planned. I'd given Mellisa just what she needed to break it off with me. I picked up my clothes and stared dressing and Mellisa said, "What are you doing?" 

 "I'm getting dressed so I can bail out of here. Obviously I've just had two relationships crater on me and it is time for me to hit the road." 

 "You think you are just going to walk away from this?" 

 I shrugged and finished tying my shoes. 

 "Bullshit Ryan. I told you that if we ever got back together Dynamite wouldn't be able to separate us again. Sit your ass down, we three have some talking to do." 

 She turned to her mother, "Are your orgasms greater when he goes down on you after you have made love to daddy and still have his juices in you?" 

 Mary Ellen nodded a yes. 

 "How much greater?" 

 "They are stupendous." 

 "Did he finish before I beat on the door?" 

 "No, we were just starting." 

 "Get your clothes off Ryan." 

 "What?" 

 "Get naked. You can't just leave my mother hanging. But first, give me the key to your apartment." 

 "What? Why?" 

 "Because I'm not going to stay here and watch dummy. When you get done come on home and I'll be waiting for you. And sweetie? If you can do it for my mother, you can do it for me, at least until we get married and maybe even after that. It is one of the things we will have to talk about. You take your time here. I'll need some time to get myself laid, but I will be full for you when you get home. I'll talk to you later mother so we can work out a schedule so we don't intrude on each other, at least until I can help you find a way to get daddy giving you what you need." 

 She turned to me, "Oh and one more thing Ryan." 

 "What?" 

 "Tomorrow we will go shopping for my engagement ring" and then she was out the door leaving me and Mary Ellen staring at each other. Report_Story
