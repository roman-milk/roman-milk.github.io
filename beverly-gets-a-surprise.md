 ****** Beverly Gets a Surprise ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I was just carrying the last of my things into Sarah's bedroom when I heard the garage door opener start to run. I glanced at my watch and saw that it was only ten-thirty and I thought "That sure didn't take long. Only three and a half hours to wreck a marriage that had lasted twenty-three years. Actually, it had taken less than five minutes. 

 I heard the door from the garage into the utility room open and then close and then I heard her high heels clicking across the tiled kitchen floor and then across the hardwood floor to the stairs. The heels made no noise on the carpeted steps, but I could still hear her coming. 

 As she made her way to what used to be our bedroom she had to pass the open door to Sarah's room and she noticed the light on and stopped to look in. She saw me putting my socks in the top drawer of the dresser and said: 

 "What are you doing Rob?" 

 "Putting my stuff away." 

 "Putting your stuff away? Why are you putting your stuff in Sarah's dresser?" 

 "It's my dresser now Beverly. This is my room now. At least it is until I can figure out what I want to do and where I want to move to." 

 "Move to? Have you lost your mind Rob?" 

 "No Beverly; that is what you did about four hours ago." 

 I thought back to almost four hours ago when I'd come home from work to find my Bev in her 'little black dress' and her sexiest high heels. I took in her get up and asked: 

 "What's up? I don't remember anything about us going somewhere. What did I forget?" 

 "You didn't forget anything. I'm going out. Your dinner is in the microwave. Just punch in three minutes." 

 "You are going out? Dressed like that?" 

 "What's wrong with the way I'm dressed?" 

 "That's how you dress when you expect that we will end up in bed making whoopee." 

 "I just wanted to look nice." 

 "Where are you going that you want to look that nice?" 

 "I'm just going to have dinner with a friend." 

 "What friend?" 

 "You don't know him." 

 "Him? Him? What the hell is going on here Bev? Why are you going out to dinner with a 'him' looking like that?" 

 "I didn't dress sexy. I just wanted to look nice." 

 "Look nice for him? What the fuck is going on here Beverly?" 

 "It's nothing Rob. One of the guys in the office asked me to have dinner with him and he is a nice guy so I thought it might be fun." 

 "Let me get this straight. A man you work with -- a man who presumably knows that you are married -- asked you to go out with him and you said yes? And you put on one of your sexiest outfits to wear when you go out with him?" 

 "Oh for God's sake Rob; its only dinner and maybe a few drinks." 

 "No Beverly; it isn't just dinner. It is a date with another man. A date with a man who knows that you are married. A date with a man who is thinking that a married woman willing to date is going to be an easy conquest and you dressing sexy is going to make him think that he is right." 

 "Damn it Rob; you are making this sound like I'm planning on cheating on you." 

 "Why wouldn't I think that? The way you are dressed for your date leads me to believe that you are considering doing just that. The fact that you are going out with another man leads me to believe that." 

 "Are you saying that you don't trust me?" 

 "I guess that is just what I'm saying." 

 "I have never given you a reason not to trust me." 

 "You are a grown woman Beverly and I don't own you. I can not tell you what you can and can't do, but I can say that I am absolutely against it and if you do it there will be consequences." 

 "Get a grip Rob; it is just dinner with a friend." 

 "I've said my piece Beverly. It is up to you now." 

 I walked away from her and went into the den and put my briefcase on my desk. I hung my suit coat on the clothes tree and was on my way back to the kitchen when I heard the garage door start to operate. I shrugged, looked into the microwave and decided that what was in didn't look all that appetizing. I grabbed my car keys and headed out. 

 I had dinner at a Burger King and then I hit Home Depot on my way home and bought a lock set. When I got home I had to decide which room I wanted to move into. Billy was in the Navy and wouldn't be coming home until the cruise he was on was over and he could come home on leave. Sarah was married and would only be using her room when she and her husband came to visit and that only happened once or twice a year and always after plenty of notice so Sarah's room was my choice. By eight I had the lock set installed and had started moving my stuff. 

 Bev stood there watching me as I put the last of my socks in the drawer and then closed it. 

 "You are being stupid Rob. You are acting like a baby over nothing." 

 I was more that a little pissed with her so I decided to screw with her. I lied and said: 

 "Nothing? That's not the way I heard it. At least one person we know saw you with your date and called me. She said she was sorry to hear that we had broken up and I told her we hadn't and then asked her why she thought that we had. She said she saw you with another man holding hands and looking all dreamy eyed." 

 Bev didn't react with "That's a damned lie" so I went on: 

 "You should have at least touched up your lipstick before coming home and letting me see you. Now if you don't mind it is late and I need to get to bed." 

 I closed the door in her face, tripped the lock and went to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I couldn't believe that he closed the door in my face. That was so not Rob. The man did not have a rude bone in his body so why had he done it? I may have badly misjudged things. 

 My Rob was not acting at all the way he was supposed to. He never fought me over what I did or wanted to do. That was one of the reasons I selected him to be my husband. God knows that I had plenty of other applicants for the position and quite frankly many of them were much better equipped than Rob, but I could tell that I wouldn't be able to control them after we got married. 

 Rob, while not overly well endowed, had enough to do an adequate job in the bedroom and he did have an added plus in that he did seem to really like eating my pussy. Another benefit was that he didn't get all bent out of shape when I wouldn't let him cum in my mouth. I swallowed for most of the rest of the guys I let bed me, but that was mostly because they were insistent on it and if they had any size to them I gave in so they would come back. I didn't dislike the taste of cum -- in fact I really liked the taste -- but it was a matter of control, By being able to refuse I was left with the feeling of being in charge and that was important to me. 

 The same thing went for my ass. Most of my lovers liked my ass and I enjoyed them playing there, but Rob never pushed when I told him no and I like that about him. It told me that I could be the one in charge and that Rob would go along with it. 

 I wasn't surprised when Rob asked me to marry him and I had pretty much already decided to lead him into doing just that when he did it on his own. I didn't say yes right away -- the control thing again -- and I planned on making him sweat a little before giving him the good news, but then Billy Neubert and Harry Short fucked that up for me. I was upstairs in a bedroom at a frat house with them and Billy was deep in my pussy while Harry was banging my ass when Harry said (as if I weren't even there): 

 "We need another cock for her so we can make her airtight" and Billy said (again -- as if I weren't even there) "Lets get a bunch of guys together and gangbang her tomorrow." 

 "Hell of an idea. Who can we get?" 

 "I know Sam wants a piece of her and I'll bet Frank, Joe, Larry and Stan would want in on it." 

 "Go ahead and set it up." 

 I should have protested, but they wouldn't have listened. Between them they had twenty-one inches of cock that they knew I couldn't say no to so they were sure that I would go along with whatever they wanted. At that particular moment, given all the orgasms I was having, I probably would have agreed except for one thing. Rob! 

 Word seemed to get around about girls who pulled trains in frat houses and the last thing I needed was for Rob to find out about me and the extra boyfriends that he knew nothing about. I had to keep Billy and Harry from going out and asking a bunch of guys to gang fuck me. It also convinced me that I'd better lock Rob in sooner rather than later. 

 Three hours later when neither Harry nor Billy could answer the call any more I thanked them for a marvelous evening (and Oh God was it!) and then told them I wouldn't be seeing them any more. They did not take it well, but so what! I called Rob as soon as I left the frat house and told him that yes, I would marry him. 

 After accepting Rob's proposal I was a good girl. Well, as good as I was capable of being. I only did a half a dozen guys, but I was very selective and only did the deed with the ones I knew would keep their mouths shut. I mean I was single and a girl needs to have her fun before she settles down right? However I doubted that Rob would see it that way. 

 I fully expected that the stripper at my bachelorette party was the last guy, except for Rob, that I would ever screw because I really did plan to honor my vows once I said "I do" and became Rob's wife. However, being the girl I was I did backslide a few times, but by and large I was a good girl. They were mostly one night stands when Rob was out of town on business although one was a pretty hot affair that lasted almost a year and I was pretty sure that Sarah was the product of it. Not that I ever let Gary know about it of course. 

 Just remembering Gary made my pussy tingle. A guy with eleven inches can do that to a girl. It happened at Rob's company Christmas party. Rob didn't pay much attention to his drinking and managed to get himself blotto and pass out. I'd had a few more than I should have and it made me loose and I was having fun dancing with Rob's co-workers and even let a few of them get a good feel of me when they got me under the mistletoe and kissed me. Gary, Rob's boss, was one of them. He managed to get me under the mistletoe three times and the third time he slipped me some tongue and I gave him some back. 

 By the end of the party I was hot enough to pull the train I'd never pulled at the frat house, but by then Rob was out of it so I was resigned to going home with the female version of blue balls. Gary volunteered to help me get Rob out to the car and after we had laid Rob on the back seat Gary pulled me into his arms and we kissed. We kissed passionately for several minutes before Gary said: 

 "It is a crying shame that a hot sexy woman like you has to go home from a fun party with no chance of finishing the night properly." 

 "Properly?" 

 "This is a night when you should have hot passionate love made to you. Obviously Rob won't be able." 

 "You're right. I guess I'll just have to go without." 

 "Not necessarily." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "I'd be willing to volunteer." 

 I had been drinking, but not enough to cheat on Rob, especially with his boss, so I laughingly said: 

 "Sorry, but I only cheat on Rob with guys who have ten inches or better." 

 I expected him to say something like "I guess that leaves me out" or maybe "Damn it! Just my bad luck!" but instead he unzipped and pulled out his cock. Soft it was huge. "Will this do?" he asked as I watched it grow. 

 "You said at least ten and I have eleven when it is hard." 

 I was still watching it grow when he pushed me back on the front seat and pulled my panties off me. He did me right there on the front seat while Rob was passed out on the back. I came twice before he did and when he was done he pulled me up and said: 

 "I've got to have me some more of this. Rob will be okay where he is" and he took me by the hand and led me back into the hotel where the party had been held, got a room and fucked me three more times before I left and drove Rob home. 

 For the next year Gary sent Rob out of town frequently. There were others he could have sent, but he needed Rob gone so he could fuck me. I don't know how long it would have gone on if he hadn't been promoted and moved to corporate headquarters in Los Angeles. I was three months pregnant at the time, but wasn't showing so I never got to have the "Is it mine?" conversation with him. 

 I liked Rob a lot when I married him. It wasn't love, just a very strong like and again the only reason I married him was because I could control him. I quickly learned that I'd made the right choice. I could get whatever I wanted from Rob. He always gave in to me. 

 Over time the 'strong like' turned into love and we were happy together. True, I was a bit of a slut when he was out of town, but that didn't have any affect on the love I had for him. What I did on the side was for fun, not love. 

 As I climbed into bed I wondered if there was maybe some other way I should have gone about having my evening with Sean. I was so used to Rob giving in to me that I acted without thinking things through. What was really stupid about it was that nothing happened. Nothing was going to happen. At least not that night. It was an exploratory type thing to see if maybe I wanted to play with him. 

 Sheila from Accounting was telling the girls what a great time she'd had with him. "He is hung like a horse" is what she said and that of course piqued my interest. I hadn't played with a big one for several years and I was more than ready for some fun with someone who had some size to him so I flirted with Sean off and on and then the personal assistant's job opened up and I put on a full court press until he asked me to have dinner with him. 

 All it was supposed to be was me sounding him out and deciding whether or not he could be discrete. Curse the bad luck that I was seen holding hands with him although I sincerely doubt that I was looking at him 'dreamy eyed.' Not touching up my lipstick was a major mistake, but I only kissed Sean once when he walked me to my car so I didn't expect that my make up would be all that smudged. But it was a hell of a kiss and it had me up on the toes of my high heels. I was probably going to have to cancel my long lunch date with him; at least until I got things squared away with Rob and getting him past his snit fit. 

 As I fell asleep my last thought was that dinner with Sean hadn't been worth the crap I was getting from my husband. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was dressed for work and was fixing breakfast when I came into the kitchen. The coffee was made and I poured myself a cup and added cream and sugar. 

 "Don't make any for me. I'll catch a bite at the diner near work." 

 "You are being silly Rob; there is no need for you to go to a diner and spend money when we already have breakfast here." 

 "At the diner I won't have to sit on the other side of the table and look at you. Don't bother on figuring on me for dinner either. The less of you I see the better I'm going to like it." 

 "Damn it Rob; you aren't being fair. All it was was dinner with a friend." 

 "Then you can have dinner with him again tonight since I won't be here." 

 "God damn it Rob; be reasonable. It was only a dinner date with a co-worker." 

 "The trouble Beverly is that I have been too damned reasonable for too damned long." 

 I left the house and headed for the diner. I got to work forty minutes later and since I was a half hour early I got on the Net and started looking for apartments close to work. I found several in my price range and I made a list. I'd start checking them out on my lunch hours. My goal was to be out of the house in two weeks. 

 Bev could have the house. I never wanted the damned thing to begin with. It had too much yard, was in what I considered the wrong neighborhood and was more than I could really afford. It was just one more thing that I had given in to Bev on. I loved the stupid cunt and wanted her to be happy so she usually got what she wanted. She could have the stupid fucking Lexus that she 'just had to have' and all the other shit she had talked me into getting. She could have it all as long as I got what I wanted -- OUT! 

 AT lunch time I hit the bank and cleaned out the savings account and took half of the checking account. I cashed in the nine certificates of deposit that were in the safe deposit box. I knew we would end up fighting over the funds and that she would probably get half, but I decided that I'd rather have the money and have her fight me for it than for her to have it and it being me fighting for it. 

 Back at work I got on the phone and called the credit card companies. I found out that it would be simpler to cancel the cards outright and have new ones issued in my name only than to have our current ones changed to my name only. It meant being without cards for a couple of days while waiting for the new ones to arrive, but I could live with that. 

 Just before I left work that day I stopped by the boss's office and told him I was going to be going through a divorce and that he could expect that I'd be taking some time off of work to see attorneys, go to court and the like. He was understanding and only asked that I give him as much advance notice as I could as to when I'd be off. 

 I left work and hit the Outback Steak House for dinner and then stopped at Bud's Bar for a beer or two. Brandy set the PBR down in front of me and asked: 

 "Why the glum look Rob?" 

 Brandy and I went way back. We had gone to school together and I was very good friends with her and her husband Sam and I got to be the shoulder she cried on when she lost Sam to cancer. As I sipped my PBR I told her the story or at least as much of it as I was willing to share. 

 "Any chance the two of you can work it out?" 

 "I very much doubt it." 

 "So I might get my chance after all?" 

 "I beg your pardon?" 

 "Oh come on Rob; you have to know I had a crush on you all through school. It killed me when you never looked my way because you were so gaga over Beverly." 

 "Really? I guess you are right. I never noticed." 

 "Well keep me in mind if and when you cut loose from Bev." 

 Another customer called for her and she moved down the bar to take care of him. As she walked away I was smiling for the first time since Bev walked out the door to go to her dinner date. What Brandy had said was a big shot in the arm for me. Face it. What happened with Bev was a downer as far as my feelings of self worth were concerned. To have a beautiful woman tell me that she is interested in me was a hell of a pick up for the ego. The only problem was that Brandy had said "When you get loose from Bev" and I didn't see it happening for a while. I had decided against going for a divorce. Why waste the money on legal fees and court costs. I'd just walk away and move into an apartment or condo. Would Brandy still be interested in me under those circumstances? 

 I had one more beer and then headed on home or as it should now be called - - the place where I was currently staying. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Beverly was sitting there waiting for me when I got there. 

 "Are you over your snit yet?" 

 "It isn't a snit Beverly. It is me deciding that I don't want anything to do with you." 

 "You are making a mountain out of a mole hill Rob." 

 "I don't think so Beverly. I'm looking at it as taking a bulldozer and cutting the mountain down to ground level." 

 She looked at me as if she didn't understand what I was saying, which she probably didn't, and then she said: 

 "I tried to use my Visa today and it was declined so I gave them my Discover card and it was declined also. I called and they told me the cards had been cancelled." 

 "Yep. It is one of the things to do when you separate." 

 "Separate? For God's sake Rob, it was only a dinner!" 

 "So you say, but I don't believe I and you are wasting my time and yours by continuing to say it. Now if you will excuse me I brought some contracts home that I have to review" and I walked away from her and into the den.  

 

 ****** Beverly Gets a Surprise ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I was sitting at the desk going over the Snelling contract and making notes on some things that needed to be changed or clarified when Beverly came into the room. 

 "We have to have a serious talk Rob. Things are getting way out of hand here." 

 I put the contract down and turned to face her. 

 "You want a serious conversation Beverly? Well just sit your ass down and we will have one. I'll start it by saying that you are a lying, cheating slut and I have always known it. I knew it when I married you. Did you think that I didn't know what you were doing when we were dating? I damned sure did, but I put it down as you spreading your wild oats while you were still single. I thought, or maybe hoped, that you would get it out of your system and settle down and be a faithful wife, but we both know that wasn't the case don't we? 

 "You have no idea how many of my friends and even some people that I didn't know very well tried to talk me out of marrying you, but I was in love and I thought you loved me enough to honor your vows once we were married. Again, we both know how that worked out. You are probably not aware of it, but you have a certain aura about you when you have been fucked. I always knew when you cheated on me because I could see it on you. I put up with it because you never did it except when I was out of town. When I was home you were affectionate and loving so I convinced myself that you did love me, but were some kind of a nymphomaniac and needed more than I could give you. I figured that I could live with it as long as you loved me. 

 "Then along came Gary. Oh yes Beverly; I knew all about Gary. I don't know how it started, but I knew it was happening. Did you know that Gary liked to brag about the women he was fucking? Well he did and it eventually got back to me and for the first time I began to doubt that you loved me. As your affair with him went on and on I decided that you were going to leave me for him so I didn't call you on it. The commissions I made on the trips he sent me on to get me out of the way so he could fuck you went into an account at another bank and they were going to be my slush fund when you left me. Confronting you over Gary would have ended those trips and I needed those commissions. 

 "I was surprised when Gary left and you didn't go with him. Did you know that he was a victim of a hit and run? He was walking down the street and a car jumped the curb and hit him and then drove away. He lost both legs and is confined to a wheelchair. I think it happened about the time I went out to LA to visit my sister. 

 "It wasn't until after Gary was gone that I found out about his large cock. One of the guys in the office wondered out loud if Gary was still able to use his large cock now that he was stuck in a wheelchair. It was then that I decided that maybe you were one of those size queens I'd heard about. I decided that you probably loved his dick and not him and I relaxed. You were still loving and affectionate and life fell back into the familiar pattern of you only fucking when I was out of town. 

 "And just so you know, since Sarah was conceived during your affair with Gary I had a DNA test done and just for giggled and grins I had one done on Billy too. I'm sure that you will be surprised to know that both of them are mine. 

 "I've lived with it all these years Beverly because I have loved you since the day we met and I thought you loved me. Right now you are asking yourself "If that is the way it has been and he has known all along why is he so bent out of shape now?" The reason is simple Beverly. Before you thought you were being discrete and making sure that I never found out. Kind of like living a separate life when I wasn't around, but this time was a flat out, in your face "I'm going out with another man." The total disrespect you showed me in doing that showed me what you really thought of me. You never loved me. I was just someone to fill up your time between lovers; a clueless twit that you felt safe having around. 

 "You didn't even try to hide what you did the other night. You could have dressed down and told me that you were having dinner with some of the girls from work, but you didn't do that. Oh no! You dressed your sexiest and let me know that it was a man you were going to be with. Then when I let you know how I felt about it did you reconsider? Hell no. Basically what you did was say: 

 "Fuck you Rob; I'm going!" 

 "I hope you enjoyed your date Beverly because I would hate to think you didn't considering what it cost you. You pissed your marriage away Beverly. The clueless safe husband that you used to have is now history. Okay Beverly. You wanted to have a serious talk so go ahead. What do you want to talk about?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. Rob wasn't supposed to know any of those things. I'd been so careful to hide things so he would never find out. I could see now that dinner with Sean was a huge mistake. I'd taken Rob for granted for so long that I didn't think things through. What the hell was I to do now? 

 Regardless of what Rob thought I did love him and I didn't want to lose him, but unless I could convince him of that he was gone. Given how much he seemed to know I knew that the truth was my only chance. If I could make him see that it wasn't lack of love for him that had me doing what I did I might have a chance. After all, he did stay with me even knowing what he knew. I took a deep breath and then said: 

 "You are absolutely wrong Rob. I do love you and I do respect you and I'm sorry that it has gotten to where you don't think I do. I know it is my own fault that you are thinking that, but nothing is farther from the truth. Yes, I have done all the things you mentioned, but none of it was done because I didn't love you. I only did it when you were out of town and not just because I thought that it was easier to hide things from you, but because when you were home you were all that I wanted. 

 "You are right in both of your assumptions. I am somewhat of a nymphomaniac and I am a size queen. Gary was never a threat to you. All he had going for him was eleven inches and you would have to be a woman to understand the attraction to that large of a cock. None of the men I spent time with were anything more to me than human dildos. It was sex they gave me. 

 "Your trips are always a week long. When you are home do we ever go two nights without making love? No we didn't and it was because I couldn't go that long without it. There wasn't anyway I could go a full week without it. Think about it Rob. Almost thirty years together and we are still making love three, four and five times a week. Ask our married friends how their sex lives are and I'll bet once or twice every two weeks is the best they do. So yes, I am some kind of nympho. 

 "Sean was a mistake. I could have -- should have -- handled it better." 

 Even though I had already decided that the truth would be my best shot I did have to tell Rob a small lie. 

 "I did not leave the house planning on having sex with Sean. He is the VP of Sales and he is looking for a personal assistant. I want the job and I let him know it. He asked me to have dinner with him so we could talk about it in a social setting instead of in the office where we would be constantly interrupted. I dressed my best to show him a side of me that he's never seen in the office. I felt that necessary since part of the job as his assistant would be to attend meetings and social functions with him when he called on clients and I wanted him to know that he wouldn't have to be ashamed of being seen with me. 

 "Was I trying to entice him? No lies here Rob; I was. I wanted that job. Would we have ended up in bed if I had gotten it? Very likely. He is reputed to be very large, but I wouldn't fuck him to get the job. After I had the job and had settled into it it very likely would have happened. To be perfectly honest about it even if I didn't get the job sooner or later if probably would have happened. After all, I am a girl who likes size and I would have eventually wanted to see what he had, but again, no way would I go to bed with him just to get the job. 

 "Honest to God Rob, it was only dinner and it was never meant to be anything but dinner. I do love you and disrespecting you was the farthest thing on my mind." 

 "So did you get the job?" 

 "I doubt it. He did hint that my being accommodating would go a long way toward helping him make a decision in my favor. I let him know that I wouldn't do anything inappropriate just to get the job." 

 "But you also let him know that somewhere down the line he might get lucky?" 

 "I may have hinted at it." 

 "So you are going to fuck him eventually." 

 "Of course not. I can't now." 

 "What makes you say that?" 

 "The fact that you know what you know. I don't know if I can hang on to you or not, but I have to try and that means I'm going to have to change." 

 "Bullshit Beverly! You have already said it yourself. You are a nymphomaniac and a size queen. Even if we stayed together sooner or later the opportunity to try out his big cock would be there and you would convince yourself that since I've known what you have been doing for years once more wouldn't hurt. Besides, you would convince yourself that you could hide it since I still take trips for the company. You would do it on my first or second day gone figuring that the aura I told you about would have faded by the time I got home." 

 "No I wouldn't Rob. I'll do whatever I have to do to keep you even to the point of quitting my job if I have to. I'll change Rob. I swear to God I will change." 

 "Twenty-three years of marriage, four years of college and the last two years of high school add up to twenty-nine years of being a cock hungry slut and you want me to believe that you can instantly change? No way Beverly; no fucking way!" 

 "I can do it Rob. Give me a chance. I know I can do it." 

 I looked at her and wondered if she could. I loved her; always had and probably always would. I'd lived with what she was for the entire time I'd known her so could I take the chance? 

 "I don't know Beverly. I'm going to have to think on it." 

 "Just give me a chance Rob. That's all I'm asking, just give me a chance." 

 "I'll think on it, but for now I need to get back to reviewing this contract" and I turned back to the desk. She sat there and quietly watched me for a few minutes and then she got up and left the room. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I did think about it over the next couple of days and it always came back to the fact that I loved Beverly and I always would. Could she change? Could a leopard change its spots? I knew that if I gave in Beverly would cheat again. It was in her makeup -- it was part of who she was. She might try; she might try hard, but there was no doubt in my mind that down the road the Sean guy with the reputed large horn was going to get a taste of Beverly. She would try to hide it, but I'd know. I always knew. I'd known it for over twenty-nine years and I'd lived with it just so I could have Beverly. I'd only blown my stack because I'd seen what she had done as a slap in the face; a "Fuck you Rob. I don't care if you like it or not I'm going to do it." 

 After a couple of days of rolling it over in my mind I made a decision. Maybe not the best one, but one I could live with. The question was could Beverly live with it? She was used to my being accommodating to her every wish and whim and I do admit to being a bit of a wimp where she was concerned. I loved her so much and wanted her to be happy so I gave in almost anytime she wanted something. After so many years could she accept that it wasn't going to be that way anymore if I stayed? 

 When I got home from work Friday I found Beverly dressed basically the same as she had been dressed on the night of her 'date' with Sean. I was a bit sarcastic when I said: 

 "Another date with Sean?" 

 "No Rob; not this time. You said that this is the way I usually dress when I expect us to end up in bed making love. I'm dressed this way because I want to go out and celebrate my new job and then come home and show you how much I want you." 

 I had decided to come home and lay down the new ground rules of how things were going to be if I stayed, but her news changed that. I didn't want to ruin her happy mood so I said: 

 "Give me a minute to change and I'll be right with you." 

 We had dinner at Antonio's and I let her monopolize the conversation. She had talked to Sarah that afternoon and she brought me up to date on what was going on with my daughter and she told me all about what she would be doing in her new job. We left the restaurant and went to the Black Mushroom for drinks and dancing. There was more general conversation when we sat and drank between dances, but neither of us touched on our current situation. 

 On the drive home she happily told me what she planned to do with the increase in her paycheck that the new job would bring. Things didn't get tense until we got home. Obviously she wanted me to join her in the bedroom and just as obviously she was on pins and needles to see what I was going to do. She was hoping that I wouldn't say "Goodnight" and head for Sarah's bedroom. She was surprised when I told her to have a seat on the couch while I paid a visit to the bathroom. When I came into the living room she was sitting there looking apprehensive. I sat down opposite her and said: 

 "Over the last few days I've spent a lot of time thinking on our situation and on where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do." 

 Her face fell as she braced herself for bad news. 

 "It hasn't been easy coming to a decision because regardless of which way I go there are too many things over which I have no control so I have decided that I'm going to stay with you." 

 Her face brightened at that and I went on. 

 "But there are going to be some major changes to the way that things have been. I am no longer going to be a doormat for you. The days of me letting you have your way just so I could see you happy are gone. There are some things that I've always wanted to do but didn't because you didn't want to and again I didn't push because I wanted you to be happy and also -- to be brutally honest -- because of all the fucking around you did I wasn't all that secure and I was afraid that if I pushed you might leave me for one of your lovers. Now that I've found that I'm strong enough to walk away from you that is no longer a worry. 

 "You do have some say in the matter, but I'll tell you up front that a "no" from you will have me heading suitcase in hand for the door. It shouldn't be any big thing for you since I'm willing to bet all that I have that you have done it for your lovers. From now on when you suck my cock you will let me cum in your mouth if I want to and you will swallow. Understand?" 

 She nodded a yes and I said, "The other thing is that you are going to let me tap that ass you have kept me away from since we first started having sex. These things are non-negotiable. As I said, you do have a choice in the matter. You can say no and that you don't want things to go that way and you already know what the consequences will be if you refuse. So, the choice is yours. What's it going to be?" 

 She sat there looking at me and I wondered what was going on in her head and then she smiled and said: 

 "We don't have any KY, but there is Crisco in the pantry. I'm going up to the bedroom. Do you want me to leave the heels on or take them off?" 

 The Crisco was a little messy and I made a mental note to get some KY. Maybe a gallon to start. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The one thing we never discussed was her penchant for extracurricular sexual activities. I was a realist. She either would or she wouldn't, but if she did and it wasn't an "In your face" occurrence and she hid it from me (or tried to) I probably wouldn't say anything. What the hell, she'd done it for the entire time we had been together and I'd known and lived with it. 

 Sometimes what you are willing to do for love sucks. Report_Story
