 ****** Me and Patti Anne ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Once upon a time in the land of OOH Blah Dee there lived an aircraft mechanic who worked for an airline. One day the mechanic met and fell in love with a beautiful stewardess and he pursued her. Eventually the beautiful stewardess succumbed to the aircraft mechanic's charm and they were married and lived happily ever after. The story of my life? Not!! 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I'd been working for North Central Airlines for just a little over three years when I met Patti Anne Manis. One look at her smiling face and I fell ass over tea kettle in love with her. I asked her for a date and she said yes and we set it up for her next day off which was two days away. 

 For the next two days I was walking on clouds in anticipation. I showed up at her door only to find a note taped to it. 

 "Bob -- I was called in to cover a DTW to ORD overnight. Sorry. Call you when I get back." 

 I had worked at the airline and had known stews long enough that I should have been prepared for it, but I wasn't. Patti was only four months out of training so she was on what was called 'reserve.' What that meant was that she didn't have enough seniority to bid for regular trips -- called blocks -- so she was basically a substitute and would cover for anyone who called in sick, went on vacation or couldn't cover their own block for some reason. 

 The next evening she called me to let me know that she was back and we made a date for my next days off which were three days away. Again I found a note taped to her door telling me that she had been called in. We made four dates before we were able to connect. The night was magical for me. We talked over dinner and danced a lot and I was absolutely lost in her deep blue eyes. 

 Given her reserve status and the fact that I worked the afternoon shift with rotating days off made it hard for us to connect. For those who don't understand rotating days off they way they work is one week you have Mon/Tues off and the following week your days off are Tues/Wed and then Wed/Thurs, Thurs/Fri and so on. 

 Anyway, with my day off schedule and Patti's reserve status we were only able to date eight times over the next five months. With each date I fell deeper and deeper in love with her. Then we hit a spell where we were able to see each other two or three times a week for a couple of months and Patti seemed to feel towards me what I felt for her. 

 We had been making out since our sixth date and while I wanted more I sensed that Patti didn't so not wanting to scare her off I had pretty much behaved myself. One night in the middle of the two and three times a week period I was fixing dinner for Patti and myself in my apartment. I was at the sink rinsing the pasta for the Linguini Alfredo I was making when Patti came up behind me and put her arms around me. I turned around to kiss her and found her standing there stark naked. Before I could say a word she put a finger to my lips, whispered "Shush" and then led me to the bedroom. 

 Patti was not a virgin, but then neither was I. She helped me undress and then knelt in front of me and captured my cock with her mouth. She worked on it for a couple of minutes and then stood up and got on the bed. She spread her legs wide, smiled up at me and said: 

 "Come on baby; I've been wanting this for months now." 

 I got on the bed and surprised her by going down on her instead of just climbing on. I worked on her for several minutes until she grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled me up while saying: 

 "Fuck me damn it; fuck me!" 

 She was wet and I had no trouble in getting in. She wrapped her arms and legs around me and hung on while I did my best to get her off before I got myself off. It was close but I managed and then I rolled over and had her on top as I slowly went limp. When she got off me she asked: 

 "Why did we wait so long?" 

 "I was just stupid I guess." 

 "We have to make up for lost time" she said as she moved down and took me in her mouth. We never did get back to the Linguini. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 From that night on Patti and I made love every time we got together. Six more months went by and I asked Patti to marry me and she said no. She said she loved flying for a living and wasn't ready to give it up just yet. 

 "Maybe" she said, "After I've gotten some seniority and have held a block of my own for a while I'll be ready to settle down." 

 I was bummed, but at least she had left the door open for later. 

 A year went by with the two of us getting together every time we were off at the same time. I asked her to move in with me and she said no. She said that the off the wall hours when they called her for trips would keep me from getting rest. It was reasonable so I accepted it. Another year went by and because of resignations and retirements Patti moved up the seniority list until she was finally able to bid and hold a block of her own. 

 It was the beginning of the end for Patti and me. 

 The block she had overnighted in Chicago and at first there was no change in our relationship, but gradually I began to see less and less of her on our shared days off. Then one day she asked me to meet her at the Landing Strip Lounge which was a bar close to the airport. 

 She was already there sitting in a booth when I got there. I leaned in to kiss her and she turned her head away. 

 "What's wrong" I asked as I sat down next to her. 

 "This is hard Bob and I'm really sorry, but I can't see you any more. I've met someone, fallen madly in love with him and I'm going to marry him." 

 I did the only thing I could think of under the circumstances. Without a word to her I got up and walked out of the bar. It would be six years before I saw her again. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Six months later I was sitting in the employee cafeteria in the main terminal building when Alice Dean sat down at the table with me. Alice had been one of Patti's two roommates. She asked me how I was doing and I told her I was getting along okay. She asked if I was seeing anyone and I told her that I didn't have anything going; that I dated some but wasn't seeing anyone on a steady basis. 

 "It was a shame what Patti did to you and Marsha (Patti's other roommate) and I wanted to tell you, but we could never work up the courage to do it." 

 "Tell me what?" 

 "That Patti was just using you until she could get what she really wanted." 

 "Using me? What did she really want?" 

 "To marry a captain or a first officer about to become a captain. She said that was where the money was. That they made more than a lowly mechanic ever would." 

 "A lowly mechanic?" 

 "She was talking money Bob. A mechanic doesn't make near what a captain does. She did care for you and more than once she said that she would marry you in a heartbeat if you could give her the life she wanted." 

 "Gee Alice, that sure is good to know." 

 "Just don't let it sour you on stews Bob. We all aren't like Pat." 

 "We?" 

 "Not me Bob; I'm more than happy with Allen, but Marsha would say yes in a New York minute if you were to give her a call and Barbra Brick has said more than once that she wished she could find a guy like you. I'm having a party Friday night. How about you coming over?" 

 I went to Alice's party and I had a good time. I did ask Marsha for a date, she said yes and we did have a good time, but after a half dozen dates we realized that although we liked each other there was no real spark between us. 

 Next I dated Barbra Brick. She gave it up on the second date and we saw each other for a little over a year. She let me know, when she sensed me getting serious, that she wasn't the marrying kind. 

 "If I was Bobby I'd snap you up in a second, but the sad fact is that I'm pretty much a slut. I like cock, but I like different cocks. I've already stayed with you longer than I have with any other guy, but I'm starting to crave something different. The man I marry would have to be a very understanding guy who would put up with my straying as long as he knew that I would always come back to him. You and I both know that you aren't that guy and it's a crying shame because in all other respects you are the kind of guy I want." 

 "So how long have I got?" 

 "A couple of weeks, a month or maybe two. I haven't met him yet, but he is out there." 

 I actually made it three and a half more before she told me that she had found my replacement. I wished her well and moved on with my life. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next girl I hooked up with was also a stew low on the seniority pole. I went through the same kind of relationship with Carol that I'd had with Patti before Patti finally got a block of her own and one night when I showed up for a date with Carol and found the note on the door I said "Fuck this shit! No more stews!" 

 Working afternoons and getting off shift at eleven-thirty didn't leave much of an evening to do anything with so I had gotten in the habit of stopping at The Landing Strip after work with a couple of the guys I worked with. 

 There were three girls working there at the time. Karen was the barmaid and Cookie and Tina were the waitresses. All three were hard on generators and all were constantly being hit on, but I never did see anyone get anywhere with any one of them. I got along well with all three and on slow nights Cookie or Tina would sit and talk to me. 

 One night about a week after I had found the note on Carol's door I was sitting at the strip and I guess I must have looked a little out of sorts because Tina sat down with me and said: 

 "Why so glum chum?" 

 I don't know why I did it, but I told her about my lousy luck at having a love life. She laughed and said: 

 "You should have talked to me sooner. I would have warned you to stay away from stewardesses." 

 "Why would you have done that?" 

 "Because I used to be one sweetie. Four years for Ozark. The job was supposed to be fun and exciting and maybe it was if you years and years of seniority, but if you were on the low end of the totem pole you couldn't have a life for shit. Even if you built up enough seniority to bid and hold your own trip section someone with higher seniority could bump you off of it if they decided that they wanted it." 

 "That doesn't sound like it makes sense. If they had the seniority why didn't they bid for it in the first place?" 

 "Flight crews bid on a different schedule and sometimes stews follow certain captains or first officers. Say I bid the Memphis to Dallas run on the first of September and got it and on the fifteenth Captain X or First Officer Y bid that block and Sue Smith had a thing going with one of them. If she had seniority she could bump me off the block and I'd end up going back into the reserve pool until the next stew bid cycle. I finally got tired of it and quit. You need to find a girl with a steady job and steady days off." 

 "How do I do that working afternoons three to eleven-thirty? Not many places to find girls in the mornings and by the time I get off work at night all the girls have gone home." 

 "What am I? Chopped liver?" 

 "You? Why would I hit on you? I've seen you turning down guy's right and left ever since I started coming in here. I don't believe that there has been a night I've been in here that some guy hasn't tried to hook up with you." 

 "And all of them have a snoot full and half are married and are out looking to cheat and the other half are single and are looking for one night stands. Neither of which I am interested in. I will not allow myself to go out with some clown who flirts with me and tries to cop a feel whenever he can. Face it Bobby; very few of the men who come in here are the type I'd be interested in." 

 "That brings up the question that given what you've just said why would you consider me?" 

 "You have been coming in here now for almost three years and not once in that time have you made a lewd or suggestive remark; you have never been anything other than nice and polite and even though I have seen you looking at me appreciatively you have never stepped over the line." She laughed and then said, "Plus, you tip better than average." 

 "Aha!" I said, "You want me for my money." 

 "Don't be silly. You are an aircraft mechanic. You make good money, but a Daddy Warbucks you ain't." 

 "You got me there. I might not be in the bucks, but I'm not stupid. You just opened a door I'd be a fool not to walk through. Would you like to go out with me on your next day off?" 

 "That would be this coming Sunday." 

 "Rats!" 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "My days off this week are Friday and Saturday. I won't have a Sunday off until the weekend after the one coming up." 

 "That's right; I'd forgotten that you blue duck guys have rotating days off." 

 "Blue duck guys?" 

 "That's the tail emblem on your planes right? A blue duck in a circle?" 

 "I've never heard us called blue duck guys before." 

 "Yes." 

 "Yes what?" 

 "I'd love to go out with you Sunday after next." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 It was on our third date that Tina set me straight. 

 "I want a steady boyfriend Bob, but at this point in my life I'm not interested in getting married. I became a stewardess because I have a bad case of wanderlust and I'm always wanting to go places and do things and flying all over met that need. I don't fly anymore, but I still have that urge. 

 "I don't know if you have noticed or not, but I occasionally disappear for a month or so. I'm a damned good cocktail waitress so Joe always holds my job open for me. Plain and simple Bob I am not a settle down and be a wife and mommy kind of girl. Can you handle a friends with benefits relationship with a girl like that?" 

 "Friends with benefits? What benefits?" 

 "That comes when you take me home tonight." 

 If I had any doubts that I might not be a friend's with benefits kind of guy the night with Tina cured me of that. The woman flat out loved sex! We undressed each other and then she went down on me. I returned the favor and then she pulled me up and told me: 

 "Do me hard bobby; do me hard." 

 I got us both off and she swung around into a sixty-nine and when she had me up she had me do her doggie. I got us both off again and then she went down on me again. It took her a while to get me serviceable and when she did she said: 

 "Anal this time Bobby; fuck my butt." 

 She rode me hard that night and put me up wet. No way was I not going to be her FWB from that night on. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Tina and I settled into our FWB relationship and for the next three years we kept steady company. It wasn't always easy with her days off being Sunday and Monday and me only having Sat/Sun, Sun/Mon and Mon/Tues every four weeks, but I did pick her up when she got off work two or three nights a week. 

 I got tired of renting an apartment and getting nothing but a collection of rent receipts so I went looking and found a nice three bedroom house with an attached three car garage and became a home owner. I asked Tina to move in with me, but she said no. 

 "I like my independence Bobby. What we have is perfect for me and I don't want to change any part of it." 

 Every six or seven months or so Tina would disappear for anywhere from two weeks to a month and when she got back she would tell me all about where she had gone. I kept telling her that we could go on trips together since as an airline employee I had pass privileges, but she always told me that she needed her alone time and her trips gave her that. 

 And then, almost three years to the day when we first got together, Tina came back from a month in Tempe, Arizona and told me that we couldn't see each other any more. 

 "I met a guy Bobby and I swear to God sparks flew when we looked at each other. I'm moving there to be with him. I know its sudden Bobby, but I'll do my best to ease the pain." 

 She gave her two weeks notice and then spent the two weeks trying to fuck me to death. And then she was gone. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 For a couple of weeks I just worked and went home. I just couldn't work up any interest in going out and looking for female companionship. I still stopped at the Strip for a few brews with the guys and Gloria, the girl who took Cookie's place when she got married and quit, and who knew of my relationship with Tina let me know, subtly, that she wouldn't mind being Tina's replacement. Gloria was a very sexy looking lady and I was considering taking a shot when out of the blue my life took a sudden turn. 

 Three guys I worked with and I closed the Strip, stopped at the Town and Country for a bite to eat and headed on home. When I got there I found a car parked in my driveway. It was a top of the line Lexus SUV and it was parked in the middle of the drive. I couldn't get around it to get in the garage so I parked in the street. As I was walking up the driveway the car door opened and Patti Anne stepped out. 

 I stopped and looked at her and wondered what she was doing in my driveway at four in the morning. She walked up to me, threw her arms around me and kissed me. She stepped back and said: 

 "Surprised?" 

 "And then some" I said.'' 

 "Invite me in for a cup of coffee or a drink and some conversation?" 

 I was half tempted to say "Fuck no!" but she still looked as good to me as ever and I was curious so I told her to come on in. I offered her coffee or a beer and she chose coffee so I put a pot on and while we waited for it to brew I asked her what brought her to my driveway. 

 "I wanted to stop by and see if I could correct a huge mistake." 

 "A huge mistake? And what would that be?" 

 "My leaving you for the ass wipe that I married." 

 "Ass wipe? You said you met someone and fell madly in love with him. You fell in love with and married an ass wipe?" 

 She took a deep breath and then said, "I didn't actually tell you the truth there. I wasn't madly in love with him. I liked him; I liked him a lot, but I didn't love him like I loved you. The thing was that he was a high seniority captain making almost a hundred thousand a year. I grew up poor and getting by on hand me down's from my two older sisters and I wanted the good life. To be blunt about it I wanted the life you could never give me on a mechanic's pay. Jim was hot for me and tried like hell to get me so even though I loved you and only liked him I let my greed lead me away from you." 

 "And you are back here why?" 

 "Because I've never forgotten you. When I divorced Jim and came home I found out that you weren't married and after several months of trying to work up the courage I finally managed to get myself over here." 

 "So just what is it you are after Patti Anne? Forgiveness for shitting on me?" 

 "Frankly I was hoping for more than forgiveness. I want a chance to get you back." 

 "Why? I'm still a lowly mechanic making lowly mechanic's wages and I don't see that ever changing." 

 "I found out that living the good life with an asshole didn't even come close to what we had before I let greed get in the way. All I'm asking for is a chance Bob, just a chance." 

 Call me stupid, call me and idiot, call me a sucker, but I had been hopelessly in love with Patti Anne and I'd never forgotten her or completely gotten over her. Every place I went I'd been there a time or two with Patti and when I went there I would remember having been there with her. 

 I gave her the chance she asked for. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We didn't just jump back in bed, but dated as we worked at reconnecting. On our third date Patti told me: 

 "I didn't tell you earlier because I didn't want to scare you into not giving me a chance, but I come with baggage. I have two children. Roberta and Rachel. They are twins and yes, before you even have a chance to think about it Roberta is named after you." 

 "Your husband stood still for that?" 

 "He didn't know. I never told him about you. He thinks I picked out the name because I liked it." 

 "Why would you want to name one of your children after me?" Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Me and Patti Anne ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I know it will sound stupid after the way I left you, but I wanted to have something of yours with me and your name was all I could come up with." 

 "You have never said, but how did this captain you didn't love but really liked become an ass wipe?" 

 "He played around on his overnights and brought me a case of gonorrhea. We worked through it and he swore that he would never cheat again and nine months later he brought me home another STD and that's when I called it quits." 

 Two weeks later I met Roberta and Rachel. They were identical twins and I could barely tell them apart. They were cute little girls and fairly well behaved for three year olds. I took an immediate liking to them and they seemed to like me. 

 Patti Anne and I reconnected and our seventh date ended up in my bedroom. I remembered all of her buttons and managed to push them and she remembered mine. After that night our dates on my nights off always ended up in that bedroom. We rarely got together when I got off work at eleven-thirty because Patti couldn't find a babysitter that could stay that late. 

 At the sixth month mark the inevitable happened and I asked Patti to marry me and she said yes and we set a date. 

 In her divorce Patti had gotten primary custody of the girls and her husband got ample visitation rights. He did care for the girls so he did take them often even though he had to fly in from Minneapolis to do it. He got them for one weekend a month, every other holiday and for three weeks during the summer although Patti let him have them whenever he wanted them. 

 "You know how flight schedules used to be for me" she explained, "and he has the same limitations so a set schedule to take the girls isn't possible." 

 He would fly in, take the girls for three or four days and then he wouldn't see them again for maybe a month. Patti somehow managed to get him to take them for two weeks so we could honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas. We had a glorious time and hated to head back home. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 We settled in and began our life as a married couple. It was great! I loved waking up with Patti next to me and as with most newly weds we made love like a couple of very horny rabbits. She would be waiting and ready for me when I got home from work and three or four times a week we would wake up in the morning and go at it again. 

 Things went along smoothly and then the twins were old enough to start school. With them gone Patti looked for a job that would allow her to be at home when the girls got home from school. She found one and the next five years slid by. 

 North Central was a union shop and one of the things that the union had worked into its contract was overtime rules. The way it worked was that a list was made up in order of seniority and when overtime came up it was offered to the first man on the list if he accepted it or turned it down he was charged with the hours and the next time that overtime came up it was offered to the next man on the list and then so on until the last name on the list worked overtime and then you went back to the top of the list and started over. This kept the overtime equal between everyone. 

 Overtime wasn't a regular thing and the airline tried to avoid it since it was time and a half for the first four hours and double time for anything over four. While it was avoided if possible there were times when they had no choice. One day I got a call at home. I was on my first day off and I was next up on the overtime list. One of our Convair 580s was on the ground at Traverse City and needed an engine change. Traverse City was not a maintenance station so a crew was being sent from Detroit. I took the overtime, packed a quick bag, left a note on the kitchen table for Patti and headed for the airport. I'd be gone overnight and would get back on the 3:15 flight the next afternoon. 

 The truck with the engine and the engine and propeller slings had already gone and would be there by the time I and the other two mechanics got there. I took my camera with me so I could take some pictures to show my dad. He was a bit of an aviation buff and I thought he might like to see how an engine change went. 

 It was a problem free engine change and we were done with it by eleven that night and the three of us checked into a motel. At six the next morning I got a call from the station manager (I was senior so I was the acting lead). The Convair had been scheduled to fly to Minneapolis, but a change had been made and it was going to go to Detroit Metro instead. If we got to the airport by seven-thirty we could fly home on it instead of waiting for the afternoon flight. I called the other guys and they opted for the quick trip home and at seven thirty-five we were in the air. 

 Patti would be at work and the kids would be in school so I would have a quiet morning when I got to the house. It was about eleven in the morning when I got home and I was surprised to Patti's car in the driveway and a rental car parked behind it. I walked into the house and didn't see Patti so I walked toward the kitchen and as I walked through the kitchen door I looked out the kitchen window and saw Patti and her ex out on the patio. They had their arms around each other and were locked in a passionate kiss. 

 I saw Jim paw one of Patti's tits through her blouse and when he did it she laughed, unbuttoned her blouse, unfastened her bra and let her tits fall free. Her ex bent his head and took the left tit in his mouth as he pushed his hand down inside of her skirts waistband and went for her pussy. Patti spread her legs to give him access and he took his mouth off of her tit and said something. Patti smiled and shook her head yes and then she headed for the door to the kitchen with her ex right behind her. 

 I'm not stupid and I knew what was going to happen so I quickly ran to Roberta's bedroom which was right across the hall from our bedroom. I left the door open just a crack so I could see across the hall and into the bedroom. I still had my camera with me and I checked the flash to make sure that it still had enough juice left in the batteries. 

 The two of them walked into the room hand in hand and then they slowly undressed each other. I was surprised when I saw the size of his cock. It was two or three inches longer than mine and I had always thought that at seven and a quarter inches I was fairly respectable. I had no idea that Patti didn't think I was enough. Once they were both naked there was another passionate kiss and then Patti knelt in front of him, leaned forward and took him in her mouth. As her lips closed around him he said: 

 "Oh God baby, you have no idea how much I look forward to this every time I come back to town. She kept sucking his cock and after a couple of minutes his hips flexed and Patti's head stopped moving and Jim hoarsely said: 

 "Swallow it baby, swallow it all" and as near as I could tell she did. There was enough light that I didn't think I needed the flash so I took a couple of shots of Patti on her knees with Jim's cock in her mouth. 

 He pulled her to her feet and told her how great she was and he was sorry he only got to see her when he came to get the kids or bring them back. Patty giggled and told him that she missed his cock as much as he missed her mouth. 

 "I love Bobby, but I still miss your big cock and wish I could have it more often. I wish you could move here." 

 "I don't think I can sell that one to my wife. Why don't you try and talk Bob into transferring to the maintenance base in Minneapolis? There are always jobs opening that he could bid. Get him to bid the next Lead Mechanic opening in Minneapolis." 

 "I can try, but I think he likes it too much here." 

 While they were talking she was fondling his dick and pretty soon he was erect again. She lay back on the bed, spread her legs wide and told him to hurry up and fuck her. He moved over her, pushed his dick in her, her hands grabbed his ass and pulled him to her and then they fucked. He fucked her hard and after about five minutes she had an orgasm and soon after he got his nuts off. He pulled out and the lay there catching their breath and then Patti moved down and took his cock in her mouth and went to work to get him up again. 

 I watched and took a couple of shots as he fucked her for the second time. They both came again and rested for a bit. He asked her if they had time for one more and she looked at the bedside clock and said: 

 "Bob won't be here for another five or six hours and I don't have to pick the girls up at my mom's until four. That give you enough time?" 

 "I have a flight to catch at three so I only have time for one more. Can I have your ass this time?" 

 "No you can't and you know it. Only Bob gets my ass." 

 "You used to let me have your ass all the time." 

 "That was back when I was yours. I'm Bob's now." 

 It was too good of an opening and I couldn't let it go by so camera clicking I walked out of Roberta's bedroom and into our bedroom as I said: 

 "Go ahead and give him your ass Patti because you damned sure aren't mine any more. I'm going to leave now and I want you gone when I get back." 

 I turned and headed for the front door. I heard Jim say "I've got to get that fucking camera" and then the sound of him running after me. I stepped around the corner into the kitchen and as soon as I heard him near the corner I stepped out and hit him in the middle of his face with all two hundred pounds of me behind the punch. Blood exploded from his nose and he went down like a heart shot deer. Patti came running up. 

 "Oh my God Bobby, what did you do?" 

 "Stopped the asshole from getting my camera. I know I told you to be gone when I got back, but I think you owe it to me to at least clean up the blood before you go." 

 I turned to leave and then as an after thought I turned back and kicked Jim in the nuts as hard as I could. 

 "You had no call to do that Bobby. He was already down." 

 "Just thank God my momma raised me right Patti Anne. She raised me to never raise my hand against a woman, but I got to tell you that right now I'm having a damned hard time trying to follow her teachings. I'll be back in the morning. Be gone!" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had to decide what to do. Go to a motel or go stay with my folks. Mom and Dad thought highly of Patti and I didn't really feel up to telling them why I wanted to spend the night so I decided on a motel. I pulled into the first one I came to and checked in for a night. There was a Meyer's just across the street so I went over and got myself some soft drinks, snacks and a couple of magazines to read and then went back to my room. 

 At six I headed over to the Town and Country for a bite to eat and then since it wasn't far to the Landing Strip I headed over there to have a beer or two. There wasn't anyone there that I knew except for Karen behind the bar and the two cocktail waitresses Gloria and Marsha. Gloria had gotten married about eight months after Patti and I tied the knot and Marsha hadn't started until just a month or so ago. 

 As I drank my beer and watched Marsha walk around I considered trying to get something going since I no longer considered myself a married man, but then decided that even though I considered myself not married I actually still was and going after Marsha would make me no better that Patti and her ex. I would be taking steps to get a divorce and once I had it I would give Marsha a try. I finished my third beer and then headed back to the motel where -- surprisingly -- I had a good nights sleep. 

 The first thing I noticed when I walked into the house the next morning was that the blood that had been on the floor where I had dropped Patti's ex was gone. Then I heard a noise from the kitchen. When I got there Patti was sitting at the kitchen table having a cup of coffee. 

 "I didn't see your car" I said, "And I expected you to be gone." 

 "I parked a block over so you wouldn't see it and drive on by and I'm still here because we need to talk." 

 "Talk about what? What I walked in on yesterday was pretty self-explanatory." 

 "That's what we need to talk about. Yesterday wasn't what you thought it was." 

 "Oh? It was just my imagination that you were on our bed fucking your ex- husband?" 

 "Of course not, but that is all I was doing. I was fucking him, not making love." 

 "And that distinction is supposed to mean something?" 

 "Yes. I love you Bob and I always have. Even when I married Jim you were always in my thoughts. I couldn't stay away Bob. When Jim and I divorced you were where I came. The last six years have been the happiest of my life. I love you and you know it. Yes, what I did with Jim was wrong, but it has been going on for five years and it hasn't hurt us." 

 "Five years? Am I that bad in bed?" 

 "You are marvelous in bed Bobby. You ring my chimes every time we make love. What I did with Jim was not because of anything you did or didn't do. To put it as simply as I can what Jim has is size. He is bigger than you and he fills me up like you can't. Jim isn't better Bobby; he is just different and I like the different feeling I get when he does me. I never realized how much I missed that feeling until he started flying in to pick up the girls. Every time I saw him I thought about it and every time I saw him he tried to get me to go to bed with him. I finally gave in. Other than the physical he means nothing to me Bobby." 

 "So now that you have told me that what are you expecting? That I'll say that it is okay for you to keep doing him when he comes to town? That I'll accept that it is just physical and you don't love him and will always be mine? I'm supposed to say have fun sweetie and it is okay as long as you always come back to me?" 

 "Of course not Bob. Now that you know it has to stop. What I'm hoping for is that you will accept my explanation, forgive me, and let me show and prove to you just how much I love you and want to grow old with you." 

 "I'm sorry to have to say that you are out of luck Patti. I'm just not made that way. I'm old fashioned I guess. My wife is supposed to be mine and no one else's. I seem to remember that there was even a part of our marriage vows that addressed the issue. Something about "hold only unto him" and as I recall you did say yes to that. Then there is the other thing." 

 "The other thing? What other thing?" 

 "How the fuck could I stay with a stupid cunt that plays Russian roulette with my life." 

 "Russian roulette? What does that mean?" 

 Remember the story you told me about why you divorced old ass wipe? You told me that you divorced him because he kept bringing venereal diseases home to you or was that a lie?" 

 "No, it was the truth." 

 "And yet here you are happily fucking the ass wipe and opening yourself up for more disease which you would then pass on to me. No thanks Patti; don't want none of that. That reminds me. One of the things on my 'to do' list needs to be getting myself tested to find out if you have already given me a gift." 

 "That's not a worry Bob. He swore to me that he had stopped playing around." 

 "He did did he? This is the same guy who promised you that he wouldn't ever cheat on you again and then nine months later gave you another disease? And you believed him this time? You ain't too bright Patti. I believe that I'll still get myself tested." 

 "Give me a chance Bobby. I love you and you know I do. Please give me a chance to make it up to you. I'll never do it again. I promise I'll never do it again." 

 "I gave you a chance when you first came back here Patti and look how that turned out. Sorry Patti, but one time was once too many." 

 I left the kitchen and headed for the bedroom to change my clothes and I was standing naked at the dresser getting a clean pair of briefs when Patti walked into the room naked except for high heels. She struck a pose and said: 

 "Are you sure that you don't want this anymore?" 

 There is just something about a sexy naked woman in 'come fuck me' heels that gets to me so I immediately went stiff. 

 "I thought so" Patti said as she walked over and went to her knees in front of me. Her hot mouth surrounded my cock and she went to work. I let her blow me for about two minutes and then I pulled her up and pushed her to the bed. She fell back on it, spread her legs wide and smiled up at me as she waited. 

 Our normal way of making love was for Patti to start sucking me and then I'd go down on her for a while before sliding my cock into her, but this time I just moved between her legs and speared into her. I fucked her as hard as I could until I got my rocks off and along the way she did have a climax. Once I'd cum I pulled out and moved up so that my cock was at her mouth and she opened it and took me in. 

 It took her a bit to get me hard again and when she did I told her to get up on her hands and knees. She did it and I moved behind her and put my cock against her asshole. 

 "Aren't you going to use some KY and get me ready?" 

 "I heard you tell ass wipe that your ass was mine and I want it now" I said as I pushed hard. 

 She gave a cry of pain as I drove myself into her, but I ignored it and started fucking her. He whimpered for a bit and then she started pushing back at me and moaning. I'd just cum in her cunt so it took me almost ten minutes to reach the point where I was ready to blow. I grabbed her hair and pulled her head back as I said: 

 "Here it comes slut!" 

 I drove hard into her and erupted. When my cock went soft I pulled out and then did something that I had never done before. I still had her hair in my hand and I pulled her head around. As she opened her mouth to say "Ouch" I shoved my shit and cum covered cock into her mouth and said: 

 "Suck it clean slut!" and I held her head on me until she did it. When I was satisfied I let her hair go and she pulled back, jumped off the bed and ran for the bathroom and I smiled as I heard her tossing her cookies. I was dressed when she came back into the room. 

 "God damn it Bob; why did you do that? That was disgusting." 

 "That's the way you treat whores Patti and cheating wives are whores as far as I am concerned. Now would you please pack your shit and get out of my house?" 

 "But we just made love." 

 "That wasn't love Patti; that was just me getting a piece of ass since I don't know how long it will be until I can hook up with a woman again. Now please get out." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It took seven months for the divorce to become final and for seven months I got two or three phone calls a week from Patti asking me to stop the divorce and take her back. I do have to admit that a time or two I remembered her standing there in the bedroom in her 'come fuck me' heels and I almost weakened and gave in, but I didn't. 

 I did take a shot at Marsha and kept taking them for maybe a month before she gave in. It was another month and a half before I scored and then we went at it hot and heavy for two months before she told me that it was over. 

 "My fiancé will be home from Spain next week. You were my final fling -- my last wild oats -- before I get married, settle down and start having babies." 

 At the same time she cut me loose she stopped working at the Strip and I found out later that she had given two weeks notice. In a way I was glad that I hadn't known that. Being with her and knowing that I would be history in two weeks would have sucked big time. 

 Three days after Marsha dropped me I came into the Strip with three guys from work and we took a table back in the corner as far from the juke box as possible so we could talk without shouting. I had my back to the dance floor when a familiar voice behind me asked: 

 "What are you having guys?" 

 I turned and saw Tina standing there. She looked at me and winked and I said: 

 "I'll have a PBR and an order of FWB." 

 She smiled at me and said, "You got it." Report_Story
