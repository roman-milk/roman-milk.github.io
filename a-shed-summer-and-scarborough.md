A Shed, Summer, and Scarborough
===============================

OK, here's my offering for the Summer Loving contest. It's a love story primarily but, because the principal character's mother is involved in an incestuous liaison with her son, it's an incest piece too. 

 Some of the terms I use are colloquial, but where I've included local expressions I've also put in a brief explanation for those unfamiliar with the terms. 

 I intended some of the dialogue to come over with a regional inflection - - Yorkshire, England -- but I have, however, kept it to a minimum; not only would it make the piece less attractive to read, it's bloody tiring to write too! 

 As ever, feedback is appreciated. 

 Any errors that remain I apologise for. 

 I hope you enjoy mu efforts. GA -- Ely, Cambridgeshire -- 18th August 2012. 

 Prologue 

 The picture, a black and white photograph, faded almost sepia after over four decades, shows three figures on the sands at Scarborough. We're smiling broadly in a busy seafront scene, with the Lord Nelson hotel behind us. I'm in the middle, trousers belted around a shirt that billows behind me in the brisk breeze like a spinnaker. Despite the wind it's a warm day, and the sleeves of the shirt are rolled up around my forearms, while my mother and Carolyn both wear light summer dresses. My mother, Marjorie is grinning at my profile while I stare out of the picture, looking right into the camera lens. On the other side of me is Carolyn, dressed in blue I recall, while my mother wore a summery canary yellow. 

 The photo brings back memories of that summer, memories that I haven't let slip away, but which, like the picture, are faded by years. 

 That summer saw huge occurrences in my life. I lost my virginity, and had a number of sexual adventures that I sometimes can't quite believe happened. But they did come about, and that photo whisks me right back in time, to the Lord Nelson Hotel in Scarborough, and the weeks leading up to the visit. 

 

 One 

 Carolyn sunbathed in the garden oblivious to my presence while I watched, my face pressed against the rough, untreated wood, with an eye to the hole I'd enlarged with a penknife. The woman, voluptuous and ripe, lay on the deckchair, her body covered by a daring bikini while I sweated within the confines of the shed. I wanted to touch myself but had been too afraid of discovery. It would be bad enough to be caught there as it was, my lecherous transgression obvious, but to be found there with my trousers around my ankles, erect cock in my hand ... Well, it wouldn't be too good. 

 I watched for a full hour as Carolyn first basted the front of her body, my eyes fixed on her big tits -- which I wished weren't covered, I'd love to see her jugs all bare -- before she rolled over and did the same to her back. Finally she hefted herself up on extended arms, her breasts hanging beneath her as she swivelled her body and sat on the edge of the striped, canvas seat. 

 Facing me she reached for her cigarettes which lay on the grass next to the deckchair. She lit up and smoked for a few seconds, giving me one last, lingering look at her body before she rose to her feet, picked up the towel and her cigarettes, and walked back up the garden path towards the house. 

 It wasn't a big garden, but a tall hedge masked the shed from view from the house. The path to the shed led alongside the brickwork of a neighbouring fence, past a postage stamp of lawn, and down another five yards or so to where my father, before he'd buggered off, had laid a flagstone patio. In the tightly packed and densely populated terraced street. The garden, due to the high hedge and shed, afforded valuable privacy in an area where people lived, almost literally, packed in on top of one another. Although our house was different since there were only three of us living there -- my mother, her friend Carolyn, the object of my lecherous eye at that present moment, and of course, me. 

 With Carolyn out of sight I yanked down my trousers and tugged at my stiff penis. I masturbated and fantasised over my mother's best friend, imagining the woman in all manner of lewd poses, her lovely tits exposed as she breathlessly exhorted me to fuck her. 

 The spunk squirted from me as I gasped and moaned, eyes closed while those images streamed past me in my mind's eye. I wished so fervently that I could wank my cock over Carolyn's breasts while she knelt and offered their creamy- skinned substance as a target. Finally, spent, which I knew would be only a temporary condition such was my ardour and yearning for Carolyn's voluptuous curves, I'd be ready to fire again soon, I watched my jizm slide heavy and thick down the wall before hiking up my trousers and stuffing my leaking cock back inside. 

 **** 

 The following day dawned early, as it does in late June in this part of the world. The sky, bright blue with not a puff of cloud anywhere to be seen, promised another glorious day of sunshine; perfect for watching Carolyn down in the garden. 

 I ate breakfast and pretended to go to work, leaving the house by the front door but immediately turning back to scuttle along the ginnel, a dark arch of a tunnel that ran the length of the houses, front to back. Every house had a ginnel, shared with the neighbouring terrace, to give access to the back without the need to trail dirty work boots over clean floors and carpets, especially necessary during coal deliveries. After a brief pause I sucked in a deep breath and, chancing it, if Mum or Carolyn chanced to look out of one of the back windows I'd be caught, I hurried along the path down to the shed. 

 Once inside, with the door at my back, breathing heavily in response to the heady excitement at what might lie ahead and the risk I'd taken walking boldly along the garden path in broad daylight, I eased the satchel off my shoulder and settled down to wait. In the bag, an old canvas backpack, a remnant from the war, I'd packed the usual packet of cheese sandwiches, a bottle of pop and a book, which I started to read after making myself comfortable in the old, worn-out armchair that had been left forgotten in the shed after dad had left us. 

 The morning dragged by and, although cool at first, as the day wore on the shed began to warm. I waited, reading the book and lifting my watch on the end of its chain out of my pocket every few minutes. Every so often I pressed my eye to the hole in the shed wall to see if Carolyn had decided to make the trip along the path. 

 I waited, and then waited some more. 

 I waited even longer, until eventually the sandwich had been eaten and the fizzy drink was gone. By mid afternoon I'd even finished the book, and I cursed my idiocy, the insanity of what I'd done. Why had I come here? I questioned my judgement in skiving off work, with the subsequent loss of a day's wage to hide in the shed for a brief look at a woman I could never possibly have. 

 What had I been thinking? 

 I peered out of the spyhole to see ... nothing, just the patio and hedge, no sign of Carolyn, who, I decided, must be away out on some errand or other. 

 It was time to leave this fool's task, and so I gathered up the rubbish, put it all in the satchel along with the book, and opened the shed door. 

 Of course, she was walking towards me. Sod's Law. 

 Seeing me emerge from the shed, Carolyn gave a yelp. She clutched the towel to her chest and blinked several times as her mouth opened and closed. Then, when she realised who'd appeared so suddenly and unexpected from the shed, with puzzlement in her voice, she said, "Eric? What the hell ...?" 

 I had no excuse, what possible reason could I concoct for my presence when I should have been at work in the railway yard. Being just as shocked as Carolyn I blinked, stuttering, "Oh! I ... uh ... I was ..." I looked behind me at the shed door but no inspiration came from the dumb planks. Flustered and blushing I looked down at the toecaps of my outsized boots, saying no more. 

 Carolyn stared at me and her eyes slit with suspicion. "What are you doing here, Eric? It's the middle of the afternoon, why aren't you at work?" 

 "I just fancied an afternoon off," I lied. "It's a nice day and I didn't want to be down at the yards." 

 "So you thought you'd hide in a smelly old shed instead?" 

 It did sound stupid, skiving work because of the weather, but choosing to hide out in the shed when it was such a glorious summer day outdoors. 

 "Well," I blustered. "I didn't know if ... if you were in and you'd tell mum and she'd ..." I shrugged. "Well, you know what she's like." I hoped reference to my mother's intractable nature and propensity towards stern lectures about my work ethic and the laziness of youth in general might work on Carolyn. 

 Carolyn sighed and smiled. "I know," she said, rolling her eyes and giving me a lop-sided, wry grin. "You'd think she was seventy five, not forty five." She looked at me kindly. "Go on then. I won't say anything to her." 

 Relief at getting away with it rushed over me like a cold wave. "Thanks, Carolyn," I sighed. 

 "I'm just out to get some sun on my skin," Carolyn continued. She gestured with the towel. "It was such a terrible winter ... I hope you don't mind me down here in nowt but me bikini. It's a bit of a small one; I wouldn't dare wear it at the seaside, but down here where there's nobody to see ..." 

 I blushed, feeling my face grow hot at the direct reference to Carolyn's swimwear. "Oh, no," I began, stammering on. "I don't mind at all. You ... uh ... you look ..." 

 "... Like a fat, old woman?" Carolyn finished for me. 

 Fat? God no. Voluptuous and fuckable, curved and rounded in all the right places. "Fat?" I said. "You're not fat, Carolyn. I'd say ... I'd ... I mean you're ... I think you're beautiful," I croaked. Desire for Carolyn surged through me and, reckless with lust I stumbled on uncaring. "I'd give anything to have a girlfriend like you." 

 Carolyn threw me an odd look, probably thinking I'd gone crazy. She dropped the towel and lit a cigarette. Drawing at it she eyed me, looking me up and down from my boots to my eyes. "But I'm so old, Eric. Could you be seen out with a forty-two year old? What would people say? I know it's 1964 and not 1904, but ..." 

 She was taking me seriously. I'd stammered out a clumsy admission to fancying her, and she hadn't actually laughed in my face. 

 I blurted, "I wouldn't care. I'd be happy to take you out. Anywhere, I'll take you anywhere. Where would you like to go? When? Tomorrow night? Friday night?" 

 "Oh, Eric ... darling, I'm only teasing, I 'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't wear this in front of you if it's going to get you all ... frisky. I'm old enough to be your mother. I'm your mother's best friend!" 

 I stared at Carolyn for a moment before, feeling like a prize idiot, fleeing up the path towards the house. 

 How could I face Carolyn again after that ignominious cock-up? 

 Two 

 "Scarborough," my mother had announced four days later on the Friday evening. "I reckon we should take a run down to Scarborough tomorrow." 

 "What a good idea," Carolyn had chirruped, "a day out at the seaside!" 

 "You too, Eric," my mother had said, probably because as an employee of the railway I'd get us there for no fare. 

 I avoided both of their expectant faces, especially Carolyn's after my humiliation down at the shed. I'd avoided the woman all week, leaving for work early and contriving to be in her presence only when my mother was around. 

 I rose and carried my dinner plate to the sink. "Oh, uh ... I dunno ..." 

 "Oh, come on, Eric," Carolyn had responded. "Treat your mum and me to a day at the seaside. It'll be fun. We could have an ice-cream, ride on a donkey, take a refreshing paddle in the water ..." 

 My mother, warming now that her friend had concurred, caught Carolyn's infectious enthusiasm, adding, "Ooh, that sounds lovely. We could take a picnic ... Oh, come on, Eric, don't be so mardy." She turned to Carolyn and muttered, sotto voce, "Just like his bloody father. Miserable awld bugger never did want to have any fun. Not until he decided to bugger off with—" 

 And to avoid an evening of discourse on my errant father's faults -- of which there were myriad according to mum -- I interjected with, "All right. Let's go to Scarborough. I'll get my almanac and check the times, but I'm sure there's a special out of York just after eight." 

 People were forever asking me the times of trains, and even though I had nothing to do with that side of the operation, since I laboured down at the sidings, the insignia on the breast of my donkey-jacket identified me as a railway employee, and that was enough cause for me to be asked all manner of obscure questions. The book I carried in the inside pocket of my jacket confirmed a summer special, an addition to the timetable in anticipation of increased demand in the warmer months, was indeed due out of York early the following day. 

 In the morning I sat on the train opposite my mother and Carolyn as the wheels' slowed, their clickety-clack winding down when the train eased into the curves in the track and followed the route dictated by the River Derwent a few miles before the North Yorkshire market town of Malton. 

 "I'll not be a moment," my mother said, rising. 

 A crater of awkwardness yawed before me in my mother's absence, and I ignored Carolyn, preferring to watch the river running alongside the train like a faithful dog. 

 Nevertheless I could feel the heat of her stare burning into me. "What's up, Eric?" the woman asked. "You've been off with me since the other day." 

 Embarrassed, I just stared out of the window as the cottages at Crambeck slid past, kids hanging off the gate, waving. 

 "I'm sorry," Carolyn persisted. "I didn't mean to upset you." She sighed and fidgeted with the brim of the sunhat she held in her lap. 

 I shrugged, blushing, and said, "No, it's all right. I'm sorry. I got carried away the other day." With a shy grin, I added, "It must have been the sun." 

 Carolyn smiled and then pouted. "Oh, so you don't think I'm beautiful after all? It was just the bloody sun?" She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms, smiling at me through the soft frame of her blonde hair to show me, clearly, she'd been joking. She leaned forward, her breasts rolling in the bodice of her light summer dress. Clasping the hat to her thighs, Carolyn continued. "I really am sorry, Eric. It was a bad thing to do. You're so young and I forget you're only twenty; what, with your dad gone and you working, somehow you seem older to me that you really are." She looked out towards the fields as the train pulled into Malton station. Quietly, as the diesels rumbled and passengers left the train while more got on, Carolyn mumbled something I only half caught, something about her bikini and it being inappropriate wearing it in front of a young man such as myself. 

 Doors slammed shut along the length of the carriages before the engines growled hugely, roaring and belching black smoke that billowed down from the station roof . I leaned towards Carolyn and, in an urgent mutter, told her I thought she looked beautiful in the bikini, about how her age meant nothing to me and that I meant what I'd said. With heat reddening my face I finished with, "I'd love it if you'd come out with me, Carolyn." 

 Carolyn blushed, a soft, sweeping suffusion of pink from her deep décolletage, which crept along her throat and bloomed in her cheeks. 

 She looked at me while the pedestrian overbridge and crossing lights clanged past, and the train, with the Derwent on our left, clattered and swayed towards Seamer and the coast beyond. 

 "Eric," Carolyn began. She paused and I could see the conflict in her face. "Eric, I ... I don't know what to say. There's so much about me you don't know. Things aren't like they seem." I asked her what she meant. She paused for a moment and then grimaced, saying, "It's complicated, Eric ..." 

 And then my mother's return cut off any further explanation as to what made the situation so difficult. "That toilet's a disgrace," my mother said, sniffing. 

 I spent the rest of the journey contemplating the complexity Carolyn had alluded to. It would be a minor scandal certainly -- a mature woman, whose reputation was already sullied from a string of unsuitable men being seen in the company of a man half her age would stir up a cold wind of gossip up and down the ginnels. Pursed lips and sideways glances, sudden silences and scandalised, gleeful outrage would rustle through our compressed neighbourhood of terraced houses and closed minds. 

 The floozy and that lad of Marjorie's. He's only twenty ... 

 Tthe mucky cow, she's never kept a fella in her life, but now she's gettin' on she's set her cap at 'im, a young lad who can make her feel better about herself now she en't got long left of her looks. 

 Aye, dirty scrubber ... It's Marjorie I feel sorry for, though, poor love. She took that woman in and gave 'er a roof ... How long ago now? Two, three years? Aye, it's a bloody disgrace ... runnin' after that lad ... 

 Yes, I could see it all, but that didn't stop me wanting her, and I couldn't help but think that there was more to it. What had she said just before Mum came back? Complicated? Difficult, yes I'd agree with difficult, but I didn't see the complicated bit. 

 We left the train and walked down to the seafront, with me lugging the picnic hamper as I dodged and weaved through the crowded esplanade. There were people everywhere, all drawn to the coast by the promise of warm days. I saw men in shirtsleeves and ladies in bright summer frocks, happy and chattering, faces tilted skyward like pale sunflowers. A woman, a nanny judging by her smart two- piece suit that hinted at a uniform, strolled by, smiling at me while her charge, in a wheeled buggy the size of a basket under a hot-air balloon, scowled with Churchillian disapproval from under a huge awning. 

 We ate the picnic on the sands next to the little harbour and its fishing boats. Gulls wheeled and squabbled overhead, or stood with beady-eyed purpose, waiting for an opportunity to snatch a sandwich from the unwary. I watched surreptitiously while Carolyn, with the hem of her dress tucked up under her legs and the sun hat on her head, ate a sandwich, which she held with dainty elegance between a forefinger and thumb while her eyes regarded the lighthouse and the sun-speckled pewter of the North Sea beyond. 

 At the end of the picnic, replete, Carolyn lit a cigarette and suggested a drink in the bar of Lord Nelson hotel behind us. 

 "I don't think I'll bother," my mother replied. She pulled a face and looked at the tall facade of the pub. "But you two go, don't let me spoil it." She pointed along Foreshore Road. "I'll pop along and get a stick of rock to take back." 

 Mum went off to buy her sugary treat while I led Carolyn into the bar. We were in luck and grabbed a table just vacated. Carolyn sat at the table to stake our claim while I went up to the bar. 

 At last, time alone so I could put my questions to Carolyn as she sipped port and lemon. 

 "Oh, Eric," the woman sighed after lighting up a cigarette. "It's complicated, I told you." She looked away, picking a stray flake of tobacco from the corner of her mouth with a little finger. She smoked and then looked me in the eye. "And why do you keep going on, anyway? You know what it'd be like ... The gossip, the snide comments ..." 

 Blushing I sipped at the pint and thought about what I wanted to say. "I like you, Carolyn. I like you a lot. I don't care about people saying stuff about us. I just want to take you out, have a good time ..." I gestured around the pub with a sweep of an arm. "Like this. Talking to you while we have a drink. Nobody minds us in here." 

 The woman drew on the cigarette and contemplated in silence for a few long seconds. She nodded, slowly. "Yeah, it's nice. This is lovely. I appreciate that you ... find me attractive, Eric; I do, I really do. And I'm flattered." Carolyn grinned and rolled her eyes. "A young fella like you -- good-looking, working, steady ..." She nodded again. "If it were just us, Eric ..." Carolyn's voice dropped and she slid closer to me along the bench seat. I could feel the heat of her body and smell her scent she was so close. 'If there was nobody else to think about ... well ... I reckon I'd give you a go."  

 

 

===

The room closed in around me then. I felt emotion swell in my chest as I stared at her. Those lips ... 

 Before I could think about what I was doing, I leaned closer to her and pressed my mouth to hers. For a moment Carolyn sat there, our lips compressed, and then, to my delight and surprise, she opened her mouth and slid her tongue past my teeth. 

 My cock swelled instantly, suddenly huge and stiff in my suit trousers. Desire made me reckless, the heat of it charging through my veins as I cupped one big breast in my hand. 

 "Not here," Carolyn gasped, twisting away from my fingers. "Not in front of everyone." 

 "Where?" I asked, my heart pounding. "Where can we go so I can kiss you and touch you?" 

 "Eric ..." her eyes bore into mine. "Bloody hell, Eric, we can't ..." 

 "Don't you want to?" 

 She paused, eyes around the pub again. Satisfied nobody had any interest in us as we huddled close together in our nook like chicks in a nest, Carolyn replied, "Yes, I do want to. I shouldn't, but I do. I want you to kiss me and touch me and ... and ..." 

 She let me kiss her again, this time I slid a hand up her leg. Emboldened by the kiss and the fact that she didn't stop my expeditionary fingers, I let my hand slide along the smooth skin of Carolyn's thigh. 

 "Carolyn," I gasped when she opened her legs for me. "God, I want to ... to ..." 

 "... Fuck me?" she finished for me. The woman shifted position, reaching for me to use my body as a shield from any eyes that glanced our way. "Is that what you want to do, Eric?" 

 Lust flared hot inside me while my brain struggled to keep pace with events. My fingers found the heat between Carolyn's legs, further exploration barred by the citadel of her underwear stretched tight across her pudendum. That word, that nasty word, from Carolyn's lips, enflamed me. 

 "Yes," I croaked. "I want to do that." 

 "What else, Eric?" Carolyn crushed the cigarette into the ashtray. She shifted her backside on the seat and pushed her hips forward to press her heat against my hand. "What else would you do to me, if you could?" She jerked her head, eyes rolling to indicate the ceiling. "If we had a room upstairs, right now, what would you do? What would you like me to do?" Her hand rubbed the bulge in my trousers. I felt a slide of goo trickle from my penis as she went on. "Would you show me your cock? Would you like it if I licked it and wanked it for you?" 

 "Bloody hell, Carolyn," I groaned. 

 "We could do that," Carolyn murmured, her eyes on my face as our clothing rustled. "Get a room here sometime soon, during the summer. We could come down here and make love upstairs. We could walk on the sands and drink beer in the bar and go upstairs and I could lick your cock ... I'd show you my tits, Eric. You could touch them and suck my nipples ..." 

 "Yes ... Yes please ..." 

 Carolyn kissed me again as she gently withdrew my hand from between her legs. She adjusted her clothing and picked up her drink. 

 "Think about it. See if you can think up a way for us to be alone together. Anyway, whatever you do, shift over and try to calm down," Carolyn nodded at my lap, "and make that hard-on go down, here comes your mam." 

 **** 

 She met me in the shed the following afternoon. 

 "I'm just off to see Davey," I'd called to my mother. "He needs a hand fixing his motorbike." I left the house and then ducked back down the ginnel. 

 Carolyn had walked down the path a few minutes later. 

 "Your mum's just up in the kitchen," Carolyn said as she closed the shed door behind her. "I told her I was just going for some sun." Carolyn fanned a hand in front of her face. "Bloody hell, it's warm in here." 

 I couldn't reply, being too busy staring at her in that bikini. Sitting in the old arm chair I took in her figure, the full breasts heavy in the cups of the bikini top, her wide hips and taut thighs. 

 Carolyn smiled down at me, posing, hands on hips, head tilted, amused smile twitching the corner of her mouth. "Getting a good look?" she asked. 

 I nodded, my voice a croak when i replied, "Yeah ... Oh yeah ..." 

 Carolyn reached for the clasp between her shoulder blades. 

 "Then look at these," she murmured. 

 I half rose from the chair. My fingers dug into the fabric of the arms as I hung suspended, half in and half out, my arse hovering over the cushion. Carolyn's big breasts swung as she dropped the bikini top onto the towel she'd left on a table. 

 My eyes bulged and I could feel my jaw hanging slack. 

 Carolyn lifted her breasts in her palms, the flesh spilling over her fingers. 

 "Come on," she whispered. "Come and touch them. I know you're dying to feel." 

 I went to her and lifted her breasts in my hands. Carolyn sighed and let her head loll back. 

 "Carolyn," I moaned. "Bloody hell ..." 

 "Show me your cock," the woman said as she stepped back. I heard the urgency in her tone and unbuttoned my flies. "Come on," she gasped. Come on ..." Then, when I hauled my tumescence into view, she moaned and moved towards me, reaching for me as our bodies closed together. 

 We kissed, Carolyn's hand massaging the length of me with slow strokes of her fist. 

 "You mucky bugger," she said. "Skulking down here in the shed. Is this where you go to wank off?" 

 "I've watched you out there," I moaned. "While you lay on the deck-chair in that bikini. I watched you for ages and pulled myself off when you'd gone." 

 Carolyn stopped stroking my erection and looked into my face. "You naughty boy. Fancy spying on me ..." She began to stroke my penis again. "You should have come out into the garden and showed me. I might have sucked it." She kissed my mouth again, her tongue sliding over mine. "Would you like that, Eric? Me sucking your cock outdoors? Imagine it, you all bare, me on my knees licking you ..." 

 "Carolyn," I moaned, my voice curdled with lust. "I ..." 

 She squatted in front of me, her face close to the head of my cock as she stroked me faster and faster. 

 "Sucking your cock, Eric," she said and slurped at the dome. "Sucking your big cock." 

 The squirt of my ejaculate arced over her shoulder, which caught the woman by surprise and caused her to cry out. Another spurt landed across one cheek while a third rained down against her throat. 

 "Sorry," I sobbed. "I ..." 

 "Just come for me," Carolyn purred, her fist still jerking at me. "Show me all that spunk ..." 

 I groaned and sighed, my fingers pushing through the woman's fair hair as I tried to force her mouth around my spitting penis. 

 Carolyn took my cock into her mouth. She slurped and sucked at it, squeezing it close to my balls, down at its root as she coaxed my climax to its finale. 

 "There," she said, wiping a hand across her mouth. "That's got that out of the way. How do you feel now, Eric?" 

 Carolyn rose to her feet and I stared at her, ecstatic at what we'd done, what she'd done to me. Now, desperate for her, I gasped, "Can I fuck you? I have to fuck you. Please, Carolyn ..." 

 A cloud crossed the woman's face. She looked into my eyes, hers full of sorrow. 

 "Oh, Eric," she sighed as my jizm slid down one breast. "I shouldn't have done that." She shook her head. "I don't know why I did it. It's madness. We shouldn't have kissed in the pub; I should never have led you on ..." 

 "Carolyn," I said, annoyed and frustrated at this capricious blowing of hot and cold. "What is it? Why are you doing this? I thought ... since Scarborough yesterday ... I mean ... aren't we going to be together?" I gestured to my semen sliding over her skin. "What we just did ... Please, Carolyn, tell me what I have to do ... What's wrong?" 

 She turned from me and picked up the towel. Carolyn dabbed at her chest and wiped her face, removing the traces of my outpouring from her body. 

 "I told you," she said quietly. "It's complicated." 

 I wanted to take her and shake her, force her to explain. Moving to her, an awkward step given my legs were hobbled by my trousers around my shins, I reached for the woman's shoulders, intent on holding her and looking into her eyes while I questioned her. 

 Just as I opened my mouth to speak, I heard my mother's voice calling, "Caro? Carolyn, darling, where are you?" 

 Three 

 We hadn't been caught, but what I'd heard, the conversation that ensued between my mother and Carolyn, after my lover had quickly fastened her bikini top and wiped the cum off her skin and stepped out of the shed, had stunned me. 

 I heard Carolyn's attempt to shut my mother up. She knew I could hear every word that passed between them. As my mother spoke, the horrible realisation of why the situation was so complicated for Carolyn revealed its sordid head. 

 That evening, while I lay on my bed thinking about what I'd heard, Carolyn knocked on my bedroom door. 

 "Eric," she whispered. "Eric, can I come in?" When I didn't answer, she knocked again. "Eric," Carolyn hissed. "I'm coming in anyway. I have to talk to you." 

 "Go away," I snapped when the knob turned and Carolyn came in. "I ... I ..." 

 I saw guilt and fear on her face. "Please, Eric. Let me explain." 

 I rolled over on my bed to face her. "Explain? Explain how? What could you say that could make me understand ..." I waved a hand at her and turned to face the wall again. "Just fuck off," I spat. 

 The bed creaked under her as Carolyn weight settled against the mattress. "You think this is easy for me?" she hissed. "I didn't mean for any of it. I didn't intend ..." The woman sighed, the bed springs creaking as she moved, her hip nudging the small of my back as she shifted further onto the narrow bed. "But you kept on at me, if you recall, Eric. You're the one who spied on me, who told me I was beautiful and who kissed me in the pub yesterday. You wouldn't have been any the wiser if you'd just left me alone, but no, you had to lure me to the shed earlier." 

 The accusations smarted, their sting making me turn to face her. 

 "You wanted to come down to the bloody shed. You even told me to use Davey as an excuse. You ... you ..." 

 Carolyn sighed as she eyed the bedroom door. "I know," she responded quietly, her expression nervous, as though she expected my mother to catch us at any moment. "I'm sorry." 

 "My mum, Carolyn," I said. "You and my mother ...? Lezzas?" 

 Carolyn winced. "Not exactly," she murmured, eyes downcast. "That isn't what it's like either." 

 "It bloody sounded like it," I snapped back in retort. "When she came looking for you at the bottom of the garden, it didn't sound like it. What was it she said?" 

 Carolyn closed her eyes. She lifted her chin and turned her face from me. "Don't ... Just don't." 

 I carried on, relentless, I wanted to strike out and hurt her. "She asked why you were in the shed. Good bloody job she didn't come inside, she'd have seen me there with me keks round me ankles ... But she was too interested in you and your big tits to look inside the old shed. I nearly shit meself when she said how lovely you looked, all tanned and everything, but when she asked if she could ... if she could kiss your quim ..." 

 Carolyn sighed. "I'm sorry. I didn't know she'd follow me; I had no idea she'd get all saucy in the garden. She never has before." 

 "Oh, you just save it for indoors?" I snarled. I laughed, a short, bitter bark. "I thought you and her shared a bed because we only had two bedrooms ... I never even thought that you might be rubbing each other's twats." 

 Carolyn stiffened. "There's no need to be crude." 

 But I was in the mood, shocked and hurt myself, to hurt her. "That's what you do, isn't it? Rub each other? Do you finger my mum's twat or not? What else do you do to her, Carolyn? Do you ... do you lick it?" 

 "I kiss her and she kisses me. We need each other, Eric. We ... comfort each other. She keeps me strong and I do the same for her," the woman said quietly. 

 Jealousy put venom in my voice. "And you do mucky things together." 

 She nodded to herself, her face set and determined. "Yes," she added, defiantly, "I finger her ... and I lick her too, Eric. I lick your mother's cunt ..." Carolyn rose to her feet and I could see her face flushed with anger. "She licks me too. She makes me come and I kiss her afterwards." She sniffed back tears, her eyes red-rimmed. "And I told you it was bloody complicated," Carolyn blurted as the sobs came. "And now I don't know what to do. Not after you kissed me and after what we did in the shed ..." 

 Carolyn stumbled out of the room, leaving me with a head full of confusion and a chest swelling with guilt. 

 I lay there as the evening light dimmed. My mother knocked and asked if I was all right. 

 "Is anything wrong, Eric?" she called through the door. "You didn't come down for tea. Carolyn said you didn't feel well ..." 

 I called through the closed door that I had a gyppy tummy, felt a bit sick and that I'd probably be missing work in the morning. My mother told me to call if I needed anything and, after she said she hoped my stomach feels better in the morning, went off to bed. 

 The night and the house settled around me, leaving me alone to brood in the dark. 

 I must have dozed because when I turned on the lamp to check my watch it indicated a time just before three. 

 Sighing, I flung the sheet and blanket and heavy eiderdown off me. Still clothed, I slipped my feet into my slippers and opened my bedroom door. I moved along the landing, past my mother's bedroom door. Pausing, I imagined the two women asleep as my mind conjured images of them together. 

 I lick your mother's cunt. 

 As Carolyn's explicit description came back to me, my cock thickened. I recalled how she'd looked, in the shed, her big breasts bared as I spunked across her cheek. Her tongue had flicked over my knob before she'd sucked me, her lips smacking when my erection popped from between her lips. 

 I saw, in my head, my mother supine and boneless, legs wide as Carolyn's tongue flickered over her sex. As I watched the scene in my mind develop, my mother's eyes flicked open. She stared at me for long seconds and then held her arms out to me. 

 "Come here, Eric. Kiss mummy's mouth while Carolyn kisses my cunt ..." 

 Gasping with shock at the tricks my own mind could play on me, I staggered along the landing and, with my fingers gripping the banister rail, I descended o the ground floor. I gulped a glass of water, and then another, all the time forcing those unbidden and shocking images from my head. 

 **** 

 The knocking woke me. When I opened my eyes, with my head full of cotton wool, it took me a few seconds to realise where I was. 

 "Eric?" my mother's voice asked, concerned. "Eric ...? It's half-ten, love. Are you feeling any better?" The knocking persisted. "Eric?" 

 "I'm all right, Mum. Come in." 

 The knob turned and the door opened. My mother's head appeared. She smiled with her eyes full of concern. 

 "Would you like some breakfast, love?" she asked, kindly. "I can do you a fry up ...?" 

 My stomach responded with a growl at the suggestion of bacon and eggs, reminding me I'd missed tea the day before. Despite the revelations, as shocking as it had been overhearing my own mother's Sapphic exhortations to her lover, and as disturbed as I'd been by my nocturnal imaginings, I smiled at mum and nodded. 

 "Aye, that'd be grand, Mum, ta." 

 I ate the breakfast and avoided Carolyn's stare. As she moved about the kitchen, my mother rattled on about inconsequential nothings while Carolyn paced and smoked. 

 Finally, as I wiped bread around the last of the egg yolk and popped the morsel into my mouth, as my mother left the kitchen to collect the post that had just landed on the coir mat by the front door, Carolyn swooped in and, collecting the plate from in front of me, whispered, "What are you going to do, Eric? I need to know if you're going to say anything to Marjorie." 

 Shed, I mouthed, and held up two hands, fingers splayed to indicate ten minutes. 

 Carolyn glanced at the kitchen door and, just before my mother returned, she nodded. 

 I made an excuse about needing some fresh air and went out the front door. I did the ginnel run again and waited in the shed, my heart pounding. 

 When Carolyn came down the path a few minutes later, I held the shed door open for her. 

 "Eric," she said. "I've been so worried. I hardly slept a wink." Her fingers worried at the neck of her sun dress. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you found out like that." 

 "It's all right, Carolyn," I said, hoping to soothe the nervous woman. "It was a shock. But I think ... I reckon I can understand it." 

 "Oh ... Oh, thank, God ..." Carolyn stepped towards me. 

 I held up a hand to stop her advance. "But what about us? I mean, what about wanting to go away with me and walk along the sands and make love? What about yesterday, Carolyn? What about what happened in here yesterday afternoon?" 

 "I loved what we did," Carolyn responded. Her eyes, big and blue and wide open, stared at me. "I loved kissing you in the pub ... It's been so long since a man kissed me ..." The woman stopped when she realised what she'd said. 

 "Is it different to a woman's kiss?" I asked. "Does my mother kiss you any different?" 

 Carolyn blushed, her eyes moving across the floor before they found my face. 

 Very quietly, she answered, "Yes. It feels so bloody different." 

 Outside, summer bloomed in a burst of life, and I heard the birds, busy with concern for their fledglings, singing and calling, a chorus that proclaimed the promise of the season. With the energy of a young man surging through my veins and swelling my penis, inside the shed I went to Carolyn and kissed her. 

 A flare of heat comparable to the sun high above overwhelmed us both. Carolyn grabbed me and returned the kiss with a fervour that sent me back a pace. Her breath panted into my open mouth as our tongues slid and writhed, and Carolyn groaned when I grabbed her buttocks and squeezed. 

 I helped her lift the dress over her head before Carolyn's fingers scrabbled at the buttons on my trousers. 

 "I love you," I blurted when I saw her standing in front of me in her underwear, her chest heaving as she stared at me. 

 "Oh, you silly bugger," Carolyn breathed. "You silly, silly bugger. Don't love me, it'll end in tears." 

 But I shrugged off her words and put my arms around her, drawing her near and reaching to unclasp her bra. 

 "Shut up," I growled. "Shut up and ..." I nodded to Carolyn's underwear which, as she stared into my eyes, she slid down her thighs to finally stand there with her hands at her sides. 

 "There," she said, with a challenge in her uptilted chin. "I'm bare for you." 

 I fell on her, my hands and mouth going straight to her breasts. She held my cock in her fist as my fingers found her. 

 "Hot," I gasped. 

 "Stiff," she moaned. "Fuck me. Put it in and fuck me." 

 I lifted her bodily with my hands clasped around her waist like a dance partner. Carolyn yelped as I twirled her through the air and plonked her on the table. Then, mindless, all coherent thought gone, desperate for her, my fingers splayed her sex as she opened her legs and offered herself to me. I shuffled forward, trousers around my ankles but with my hard-on in my fist. My cock-head nudged at her, and I looked into the woman's face, anxious now. Would I do it right? Would I be able to please her? 

 I hesitated. 

 "Put it in," Carolyn moaned. "Stop fucking about and put it in." 

 "I've not done this before ..." 

 Carolyn's eyes widened. "You're a virgin?" When I nodded, my eyes closed, Carolyn leaned forward and kissed my mouth. "I'll look after you," she murmured. "Here, let me show you." 

 Her fingers closed around me. She shifted her bottom over the table and held me at her opening. Carolyn's knees folded, her legs lying against my hips as she pulled me into her. 

 I sighed and then grunted, my eyes wide and locked on Carolyn's as her body, hot and wet and tight opened to accommodate me.  

 

 

===

Carolyn chuckled from low and deep in her chest before groaning at me to fuck her. "You're a nice, big boy, Eric. Use that lovely cock and fuck me." 

 My hips jerked instinctively while my fingers found Carolyn's and I pulled her onto my cock. She smelled gorgeous when I pressed my mouth against her shoulder, licking her there before kissing her soft and vulnerable neck. Carolyn moaned and leaned back, offering her throat to me. Her breasts thrust forward with her movement, and so I sucked at each nipple, all the time fucking into her with urgent strokes. 

 She looked so beautiful with her eyes closed, her head lolling and hair swinging. I caressed those shivering breasts with one hand, marvelling at the texture of them and testing their weight. 

 "Oh, Carolyn," I groaned. "I'm ..." 

 "Yes!" she cried. "Come for me, darling. Show me how much I excite you." 

 I grunted and hissed as I bit Carolyn's neck and the lust surged through my cock. My penis pulsed and spat semen into Carolyn's body. The woman cried out and squirmed on the table top. My cock, still squirting viscous ejaculate, slipped out of her and sprayed the stuff against Carolyn's thigh before more gooey spunk spattered down onto her stomach. 

 A thick and glistening rope clung to Carolyn's pubic bush, which she then smeared into her oily vulva with her fingers as she rubbed herself. 

 "You spunked over me, you dirty bugger. You came on me." Carolyn grinned at me as I stood between her legs, my penis oozing semen. "Don't look so worried," she continued. "I love it." Then she groaned and closed her eyes. Her face fell slack while her fingers blurred. I stared at the woman's sex when I heard slick, wet noises from where Carolyn's fingers squirmed through the folds of her labia. "Oh fuck," she groaned. "Oh fucking hell ..." 

 An urgent need to taste her overwhelmed me. It was imperative, right then, at that moment, to lick Carolyn's cunt. 

 "Put a finger inside me," Carolyn hissed, her teeth set and her eyes wild as she glared at me. Lick me here," she pointed to a pink nub of flesh at the apex of her slit. "Fucking lick me there ... Hard! And finger my cunt. I'm going to come. Do it, Eric. For fuck's sake lick me and finger me." 

 I slurped and laved at her, tonguing that place as hard and as fast as I could. My fingers, tentative at first until Carolyn snarled at me to stop tickling her, probed deep, squelching obscenely and coming out of her covered with her desire. 

 When she came, Carolyn hauled me up along her writhing body, kissing me to grunt and pant into my mouth as our wet tongues danced. 

 My cock, still hard, nudged against Carolyn's thigh. I reached down and, aiming at the sodden mat of Carolyn's bush, pushed, and found her. 

 "I love you," I groaned as the table began to rock. 

 "Don't be a silly bugger," Carolyn moaned. "But fuck me. Just fuck me." She pulled my face towards hers for a lip-smacking kiss. With her hand at the back of my head, Carolyn stared into my eyes, her expression jubilant as, with eyes shining she said, "Bloody marvellous, you stayed hard after you came. Is that how much I excite you, Eric?" 

 "I never want to stop doing this with you," I replied. "It's so good, so good. You're so beautiful and doing this ... with you ..." 

 "We can do it again ... Oh fuck but we can do it again." 

 Emotion bubbled in me when I heard Carolyn's approbation. I kissed her mouth again, this time in a lovers' kiss. The woman must have sensed the change within me because she no longer urged me on with lewd exhortations, instead, as I moved towards my orgasm, she murmured endearments and stroked my hair and cheek. 

 I looked down at her body, noting mentally the sweep of her waist and the curvature of her breasts. I saw our conjunction, where her body accepted my length, watched as my cock, on the outstroke, left her body, the tip remaining inside her, creamy with our lust. 

 "Come inside me," Carolyn murmured. "Let it go inside me, darling." 

 The feet of that table scraped across the shed floor as I thrust hard and deep several times. Carolyn hung on, her fingers clasped to the table edge while I complied with her wish and came. Her body clenched around my girth, her legs twitching as she too climaxed, this time her fingers sliding over that slippery, pink bump, bringing her off. 

 I stared at her when I slid my cock out of Carolyn's body. "I don't know what to say," I mumbled. I gestured with a loose hand towards her. "I ... You ..." 

 "Don't think about it now," Carolyn said as she sat upright. She pulled a face when the residue of our coupling slid into her cupped palm when she stood with her hand between her legs. "Look at the bloody mess." Carolyn grinned at me with spunk pooled in her palm. "I'll have to have a bath now. Look at the state of me. I don't know how I'm going to get past your mother; she'll smell it on me." 

 "What are you going to say to her?" I asked at the mention of my mother. 

 Carolyn turned her pained expression to me. "I don't know, Eric. Not now. Don't ask me about it now. Don't spoil your first time." 

 Redolent of our love-making, Carolyn dressed. Then, after a soft kiss on my cheek, she left me to ponder. 

 She'd been correct about it being complicated. 

 Four 

 We took risks that summer, meeting in the shed whenever an opportunity presented itself. We were at each other, hungry and desperate; I couldn't get my fill of Carolyn and, if I wasn't with her I thought about being with her. 

 I made so many excuses to get out of the house that my mother must have thought that my friend Davy's motorbike to be a right old clunker -- it always seemed to be in need of repairs. 

 Sometimes, at night, I'd creep along the darkened landing and listen outside the room Carolyn shared with my mother. I wondered what they did with each other, imagined how two women could satisfy one another in ways that were so different to when we were together, Carolyn and I. 

 One afternoon, with my mum out of the house visiting her sister, I lay in her bed with Carolyn nude beside me. The curtains were drawn and the sunshine spilled in, tiny dust motes swirling lightly in a delicate ballet. 

 "What do you and Mum do?" I asked. 

 Carolyn turned her head and looked at me, her eyes narrowed, expression sharp. "What?" she asked as she rolled onto her side. 

 The sight of Carolyn's breasts swinging distracted me for a moment as she continued to stare at me, knuckles against her temple as her weight rested on one elbow. 

 I reached to caress her, my fingers gliding along the undercurve of the lowermost breast. She flicked my hand away with an impatient tut. "What did you say?" 

 "I wondered what you and ... What you did together. With Mum ... how is it different from me?" 

 "There's no penis for a start." Carolyn rolled onto her front and heaved herself upright. "And I don't really want to talk about that. It's a bit odd discussing her with you." 

 She reached for my cock and stroked it. I grew quickly tumescent, and Carolyn took me between her lips. I groaned and settled my head into the pillow while the woman's quick tongue worked its magic. 

 "Is this what my mum does to you?" I asked when, in an effort to prolong the pleasure and not come into Carolyn's mouth, I moved and rolled her onto her back. "Lick you ...? Like this?" 

 And I slid my tongue between Carolyn's meaty labia, splitting them apart so I could dab at her opening. Having become proficient at making the woman climax on my face, I knew where she liked to be touched, knew how she liked it. 

 "Oh fuck," Carolyn moaned. "Stop it, stop talking about her. It isn't right. Just lick me and play with me. Oh, Eric, it's so fucking good." 

 But I couldn't stop. Somehow the thought of my own mother, naked and intimate with Carolyn had captured my imagination. I brought my lover to a quick and noisy climax and then, as I eased my cock into her body, began again. 

 "Do you put things inside her?" I whispered. 

 Carolyn hissed back at me, her eyes filled with some indefinable emotion. "Don't ask about it, Eric. Stop it." 

 I pinned her to the bed with my cock, thrusting deep the way I knew she enjoyed. The woman grunted and arched her back, thrusting her breasts upwards. I sucked at her teats, pulling them between my lips, my tongue then describing wet circles around the circumference of Carolyn's areola. 

 "Is she dirty, like you? Does my mum swear and say mucky things like you do?" 

 "Oh, Jesus," Carolyn moaned. "Yes ... Yes, she's a filthy bitch too. She tells me to lick her cunt and then comes on my tongue. She kisses me and sucks her own twat off my tongue. She loves it, Eric, is that what you want to hear?" 

 From somewhere sordid, a dark pool of unspeakable depravity that, because of lust and desire and madness, polluted my mind, I said, "How about watching her fuck? Would you like to see my mother fucking a cock? Do you get all dirty thinking about watching her fucking me?" 

 "Oh, God ..." Carolyn moaned. "Oh fuck ... Oh, you dirty bastard." 

 But a long wail came from her as she came. 

 Carolyn heaved me off. She rolled onto her front and then knelt with her elbows resting on the bed and her buttocks upthrust. 

 "Fuck me," she snarled. "Get back there and fuck me, squeeze my breasts." She grunted and pushed back against me when I slid into her from behind. "More," Carolyn gasped. "Tell me more dirty things." 

 Surprised at the heat in the woman's voice, stunned by her vehement, almost violent physical reaction, as she forced her body harder against my cock, and with her fingers clawing at the bedcovers, I continued. 

 "I'd fuck my mum like this. I'd hold her tight round the waist and feel her tits. I'd make her moan as I fucked her cunt, Carolyn. She'd beg for me to fuck her. Her own son, she'd moan for me to pump her full of spunk." 

 "Fuck me," Carolyn gasped. "Pretend I'm your mother. Do it to me. Tell me how much you love fucking your mum's dirty cunt." 

 My cock pumped what felt like a pint of spunk into Carolyn. I kept on groaning and mauling at her tits as I came and came, and Carolyn too grunted and writhed, her climax breaking alongside mine. There was no love or tenderness when we fucked that time. Not like other times, on that occasion, the precursor to what came after, we were just two animals snarling and snapping in our shared moment of perversion. 

 Carolyn stared at me, her chest heaving while we both tried to reconcile the shift in our relationship. 

 "That was so ..." She gulped and shook her head. 

 "Where did it come from?" I asked, also panting for breath. 

 "I don't know, Eric, but ..." She shook her head again, as though denying what had passed between us. "Never again. We can't let it happen like that again." 

 Even though I nodded in agreement I knew, deep down, that it would pass between us again. I'd been secretly turned on by imagining my mother lounging on the bed, her legs open while she offered her sex to me. 

 "All right," I lied, "we shan't talk about that again." 

 Five 

 Suddenly, my mother became the focus for both of us. Despite her original abjuration of the subject, it came to be that Carolyn would be the one who introduced the incestuous references, with her offering some mention of Mum during our love-making. Not every time, some encounters were solely for her, often Carolyn would insist that we do it tenderly, with love and feeling, but other times, when she felt in a dirty mood she'd mention something taboo to set me off. 

 This roleplay became the catalyst for what happened during the rest of that summer. 

 One afternoon, in the shed, after a particularly filthy time, Carolyn sat in the arm chair, naked and smoking. 

 "I think we have to tell Marjorie," she said. 

 I looked at her, wondering what had brought this on. "Tell her? Tell her what?" I replied, somewhat disingenuous. 

 "About us. I can't keep it to myself anymore, Eric. I feel so guilty. I can't keep away from you, but I'm also her lover ... It isn't right that we sneak around behind her back. She doesn't deserve it." 

 I realized that I'd been feeling the same, only I couldn't face it, my main concern being what would happen afterwards. Would Mum throw Carolyn out? Would she want me to stay in the house? Despite the fact I was the main breadwinner, the only one with a full-time job whereas both Mum and Carolyn had some casual seamstress work, she might be so outraged that she might give me the boot. 

 What would happen to my relationship with Carolyn then? I loved her, had become besotted, I couldn't give her up. 

 "Do ... do you think that's a good idea?" I knew the answer even as I asked. 

 Carolyn drew on the cigarette. She nodded. "We have to tell her. I have to tell her." 

 I watched as Carolyn crushed the butt into the ashtray she'd brought down from the house. I could see her determination to put things right, no matter how tumultuous the outcome, and I could do nothing but await the result. 

 That evening, after Carolyn had washed the pots and my mother had dried them, when all had been cleared and the last of the plates was put away, mum had just settled at the table with a cup of tea in front of her. 

 I'd been reading the paper when I heard Carolyn say, "Marjorie ... Marjorie, love, there's something I have to tell you ..." 

 Later that night I heard a knock at my bedroom door. I called for them to come in, and had been surprised to see my mother's head appear. 

 "Can I talk to you?" she asked as I avoided her eyes. I nodded. "Shove over," she said, nudging my leg with the back of her hand. "Settling onto the bed, the springs creaking, she continued. "It's a bit of a to-do, eh, Eric?" 

 "I'm sorry, Mum," I mumbled, still unable to look at her face. 

 My mother sighed. "Oh, don't be sorry, Eric." She patted my knee. "I'm as much in the wrong as you. At least with you and her ..." My mother's head nodded towards my bedroom door, presumably to indicate Carolyn elsewhere in the house. "Well, it's normal for her to be attracted to a man, and that's what you are now, Eric. A man." She sucked a deep breath into her lungs and bravely, I thought, carried on. "Me and Carolyn isn't what normal, decent folk get up to," she tutted and shook her head. "If the neighbours knew ..." 

 My heart swelled with love for my mother as she spoke openly about her affair with Carolyn. 

 "It's all right, Mum," I said, my voice catching with emotion. "Carolyn told me about ... about needing to comfort each other and that. Please, you don't have to tell me owt about it. I understand." 

 My father's abandonment had affected my mother deeply. He'd left us in a house rented from the council and it had been close for my mother for a couple of years, we'd been on the verge of eviction -- a mortifying experience for a proud woman like Mum, but somehow she'd always come good. Carolyn, after a lifetime of unwise choices in men, a long-standing friend of my mother's, had come to lodge with us when yet another relationship ended badly. They'd grown close, then intimate, both needing each other at different times when their individual outlook had been bleak. 

 My leaving school and finding work on the railway eased the financial burden a great deal, but Carolyn had stayed, her affair with my mum a secret. 

 "You're a good lad, Eric." My mother patted my knee again, squeezing affectionately this time. I reddened -- if she only knew what had often passed through my mind as I drove my cock into Carolyn. 

 "What ... what are we going to do, Mum?" 

 Another sigh. "I'm not too sure yet, Eric, but ... I wondered, for now, if we couldn't ... If it might work if ...?" 

 "What, Mum, what?" I looked at her profile, wondering what she'd say. 

 "If we couldn't just share Carolyn," she replied in a quiet voice, and this time she avoided my eyes. 

 **** 

 Sharing Carolyn meant, my mother decided, that she and I would alternate between bedrooms. One night I would share her double bed with Carolyn, the next would be her turn. 

 Sex with Carolyn wasn't restricted to the bedroom for me, we still used the shed from time to time, and it had been during one of these trysts that I heard a noise outside. When I moved across to the wall and pushed an eye to the peephole, I caught the flash of my mother's dress as she moved past the hedge, the hem flicking like a deer's tail a she hurried away. 

 "She heard us," I said as I turned to face Carolyn. 

 "Oh God ..." Carolyn held her cheeks between her palms as she stared at me aghast. "Are you sure she was there? Are you sure she heard?" 

 I nodded. "She was definitely out there. I saw her." I shrugged, adding, "But I don't know for certain that she heard what we were saying." 

 "We were loud enough," Carolyn moaned as she hugged herself. "Oh, bloody hell ..." 

 "Keep calm," I said. "She might not have heard owt ..." 

 However, my mother's demeanour told me she had overheard. She wasn't in the kitchen, the usual room for congregation in our house, but after a quick search I found her, sitting quietly in the best room, the sitting room mum called it, used solely at Christmas. 

 I hesitated when I saw her just sat there, hands in her lap. She looked up to face me. 

 "Mum," I said. "I ..." 

 "It's my own fault," she murmured, shaking her head and looking through me like I wasn't there. She continued, speaking as though to herself in a subdued tone. "I shouldn't have followed you two down the path. I shouldn't have listened." Mum's eyes focussed on me then. "What you said to Carolyn ... What she said to you ... Oh, my God, Eric ..." 

 I walked further into the room, even though I wanted desperately to be anywhere other than there, looking at her, seeing the shock in her eyes. 

 "It ... it doesn't mean owt, Mum ... It's just ... it's only ..." My arms flapped at my sides. "It's just summat we do ..." 

 "Me, Eric ... You were talking as though it was me, not her ..." 

 I had no words to explain -- How could I explain? What could I say, what reason could I give to her, my mother, my own mother? Who, after all, had been the subject of our perverted word-play. How could I possibly tell her that I imagined doing to her what I did with Carolyn? 

 "I'm sorry, Mum," I breathed, close to tears. 

 Abashed and ashamed, I left the room, again taking to my bedroom for solitude. As it had those few weeks ago, on the day I'd discovered Carolyn and my mother were lovers, the night drew in while I lay on my bed in my clothes. I heard movement and muffled voices from along the landing. Then came the click of Mum's bedroom door closing, and I wondered what was going on in that room. Had they argued? Were they even on speaking terms? How had Carolyn reconciled the incestuous nature of our fucking to my mother? 

 I dreamed, and the dream had been a confusion of images -- My mother nude, fingered her sex as Carolyn stood by and watched, her own hands mauling her big breasts. Then I saw Carolyn between Mum's legs, her light coloured hair a mess as my mother held Carolyn's face against her sex and stared at me. We were in the shed as I pulled my dripping cock out of Carolyn's body and a rush of semen slid out of her and dribbled slowly along the crease of her arse. Look at the mess you've made, Mum said, pointing to the stain on the armchair. That'll never come out of there, our Eric. I'll have to clean it up. And then the dream mother moved to my lover and knelt to lick the spunk from Carolyn's opening. 

 My erection had been huge and demanding when I woke, and without being fully awake or truly aware of what I did, I opened my bedroom door and walked along the landing. Even as I entered Mum's bedroom my fingers were at my trousers. 

 "Carolyn," I sighed, massaging my hard-on with my fist as I stood by the side of the bed. "Come here," I groaned. Wake up. I want you."  

 

 

===

Of course it got a little awkward. There was some confusion, and some urgent instructions from Carolyn to the effect that I should, "Bugger off to your own room. I'll come and see you in a minute." 

 She got out of the bed, nude I noticed despite my confused state. She pushed me on the shoulder. "Out," Carolyn commanded, pointing to the door. "I'm sorry, Marjorie," I heard her say to my mother's shocked face as it hovered above the cover. "I'll go and give him a telling off." 

 Carolyn burst into my bedroom like a firework. "What the bloody hell was that all about? I managed to talk her into some kind of understanding, and then you burst in with an erection growing out of your bloody fist!" 

 Light spilled in from the bulb on the landing as I looked up at Carolyn from the end of my bed. I blinked. "I must have been dreaming," I mumbled. "It was saucy. I woke up and wanted you." 

 "I can see that," Carolyn said with a smirk, her anger cooling. She pointed to my lap where my erection jutted from the yaw of my open flies. "Would you like me to do something with it?" she asked. 

 The woman yanked my trousers down to my shins. Next she pulled them completely off and waved a finger at me to indicate I should take my shirt off. 

 "I must be insane," she muttered to herself while she knelt between my feet and lifted my cock upright. "Middle of the night and he storms in waving his cock about ..." 

 As I lay on my back, resting on my elbows, I watched Carolyn go to work on my erection with her mouth. I groaned and thrust my hips up, forcing my tumescence between her lips. 

 "That's so sexy," Carolyn," I moaned when the cock-head bulged in my lover's cheek like a lollipop. "Suck me. Go on, Carolyn." 

 "You mucky bastard," Carolyn replied when my penis plopped from her mouth. "You like it like that, eh?" She yanked at me, her fist sliding up and down the length of me. "Lazy sod, lying there while I do the work." She smirked and stared a challenge into my eyes as she opened her mouth to take me again. 

 I saw a flicker out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head to the movement and saw my mother framed in my bedroom doorway. When I opened my mouth to speak, I saw some indefinable look on my mother's face. I had a feeling then, as Carolyn, oblivious to my mother's presence sucked and gobbled at my cock, that if I spoke, or even acknowledged her presence, my mother, like a startled deer, would be gone in the blink of an eye. 

 So I watched her watching us. She stood there for a few moments longer, just looking, and then, in front of my bulging eyes, incredibly, she slowly lifted the hem of her nightgown. It came from the floor, up past her shins, revealed the pale glow of her knees as it crept higher, and eventually, as I gulped and stared, moved past her thighs. 

 My mother stopped lifting her gown, her eyes filling with fear when I groaned at the combined effect of Carolyn's tongue and sucking lips and the promise that my own mother was about to show me that taboo place between her thighs. Her feet shuffled as though to take flight, but she didn't leave, instead my mother simply paused for a moment and then, finally, lifted the gown over her pubis. 

 My cock swelled with lust as I looked at the shadowy area between my mother's legs. The light, diffused from the bulb on the landing, wasn't strong enough for me to see much detail, and about all I could make out was the pale glow of her stomach and thighs, with the dark patch of pubic hair at the centre. 

 "Do you want to make love?" Carolyn asked, still unaware of what had been going on. "Do you Eric? Would you like a nice little fuck?" 

 I couldn't respond, not knowing how my mother would react if Carolyn moved and saw her in the doorway. When I looked over to that part of the room again, I saw my mother was now sliding a finger between her legs. She looked at me with heavy-lidded eyes, her mouth slack. When I tilted my head, still not speaking a word, I questioned her with my eyes. 

 Did she want me to fuck Carolyn? Was she going to watch? 

 "Eric?" Carolyn said. "Did you hear what I said?" She shifted on the bed, rolling over so she could lean on one elbow and look into my face. "Do you want to do it, Eric?" 

 Then she must have seen the woman in the doorway, because she gasped and blurted out my mother's name. 

 "Marjorie!" Carolyn cried. "What the hell are you doing? I thought we'd sorted it all out downstairs. I thought I'd explained it's just some dirty game that Eric likes." 

 My mother stepped into my bedroom. She let the nightgown fall to cover her lewd and inappropriate exposure, and then came closer. Carolyn rose and covered her breasts with a corner of the bed cover, which seemed strange given the sexual tangle we were all caught up in. 

 "I want to watch," my mother said, her voice flat and low. She shrugged. "I was curious today, that's why I went down to the shed. I might have been jealous too." She looked at me. "Jealous of you and Carolyn. I don't know what I thought really. I was confused, and kept on thinking that you were going to take Carolyn away from me." Then my mother looked at her lover. "And I was jealous of you for taking my son. I wanted him to love me, nobody else." 

 "I do love you, Mum," I breathed. 

 "Can I watch?" my mother asked. "Please." 

 Suddenly my world slewed. This wasn't really how things were supposed to be. My face went hot and my cheeks burned with chagrin at the memory of the things I'd said to Carolyn when we'd fucked and Mum had overheard. I'd pretended my lover was my own flesh and blood, my mother, and suddenly it all seemed so wrong. 

 Just as I opened my mouth to refuse, to tell Mum to get out, to send both of them away so I could think on what I'd done, Carolyn uttered the words that changed all our lives. 

 "Stay," she whispered. The cover fell away to expose her breasts. "Watch me with Eric, Marjorie. Watch me with your son." 

 The sight of Carolyn's tits did it for me. I couldn't resist the lure of those big jugs of hers. All my embarrassment and guilt over the incestuous role-play blew away as I reached for my lover's breasts. 

 "Kiss me, Eric," Carolyn sighed. "Kiss my mouth in front of your mum. Then we can fuck. Let her watch." 

 "Please," my mother murmured when she appeared at the side of the bed. "Kiss me as well, Carolyn. Let me share you properly with my son." 

 My mouth fell open while my cock swelled hugely and I saw them kiss. To see my own mother's fingers touching Carolyn's breasts sent such a surge of emotion through me that I gasped and couldn't help but touch myself. My fist stroked along my length as the kiss grew hungrier, both women moaning and mewling as their tongues slid in a serpentine battle for dominance. 

 "Eric," my mother said, her voice thick and treacly when she saw me fisting my hard on. "Are you going to put that inside Carolyn? Is that what you use on her to make her smile?" 

 Before I could utter a word, being incapable of speech with shock at these twisting, turning events, Carolyn said, "It does more than make me smile, Marjorie. It makes me tingle. It fills my cunt and feels so bloody good." 

 "You lucky cow," my mother responded. 

 Another cold wave of shock hit me like storm waves down on Scarborough front in the winter. "You should try it then," Carolyn had said. 

 My mother chuckled. "That's a terrible thing to suggest, Carolyn," she said. "My own son?" She shook her head. "No, I couldn't do that. It's so wicked." 

 With my head swivelling like a spectator at a tennis match, I watched the exchange between the two women. I wondered what compelled my mother to appear at my bedroom door and lift her nightdress; she'd been about to masturbate while she watched me with Carolyn, I'd been sure of it, and it had only been when Carolyn moved and noticed her there that she'd covered up. Another thought in my head concerned my blonde lover. What possessed her to offer me to my mum? The game-playing was one thing, but to suggest it in reality staggered me. 

 And what if Mum hadn't refused? Would she have really let me do it? Would I actually do it myself? 

 I couldn't understand a lot of what went on, maybe it was a full moon or the fact it was the middle of the night and emotions had been fraught earlier in the day. I'd certainly been confused when I woke up from my dream, so much so that I'd stumbled into the women's bedroom demanding to see Carolyn. 

 But then Carolyn, with an indifferent moue pursing her lips at my mother's rebuttal, smiled at me and lay back on the bed. "Come to me, Eric," she sighed and held out her arms. 

 The sight of her reclining on top of the bed, all voluptuous and inviting goaded me into action. I glanced at Mum, who just stood there looking at us, and moved between my lover's thighs. 

 Carolyn's hand stroked me to full stiffness and I slid into her body. 

 "He's there," Carolyn said in a voice cracked with lust. "Your son's cock is filling me, Marjorie. Stand there and watch us fuck." 

 "You bitch," I heard my mother say. "You're saying that to get the better of me. Well, I'm his mother, he'll always love me. You're just a young man's fancy piece. He'll tire of you and throw you aside, but I'll always be his mother." 

 "Fuck me, you bastard," Carolyn hissed in my ear. To my mother, she said, "But I've got him now. He's inside me, filling me with a throbbing hard-on. When he comes he'll fill me with his seed, Marjorie. Your son's spunk in my cunt." 

 This exchange, as surreal as I found it, turned me on. The filthy words coming from Carolyn were especially arousing, and I found myself jabbing my cock into her body, gasping and groaning and mumbling her name. 

 "See!" Carolyn cried in triumph. "He's saying my name. My name, Marjorie, he doesn't want his mother, he wants a woman who can milk him of all his spunk and who can do all these dirty things with him." 

 I grunted and called out that I was about to come. 

 "Give it to me," Carolyn gasped. "Come inside me, my darling boy." 

 "No!" I heard my mother shout as the surge began. "Give it to me." 

 Carolyn laughed and pushed me off her body. I slid off her just as the semen squirted from me. A hot jet splashed against the outside of Carolyn's thigh as I came. 

 "There it is, Marjorie," Carolyn squealed. "Go and get it." 

 Before I knew it, my mum had my cock in her hand. She pumped me and held her open mouth over the dome of my cock-head as it spat its load. 

 "Mum!" I called out, my fingers scrabbling at the bed as I tried to pull away from her. "What ...?" 

 "Come into your mother's mouth, Eric," Carolyn snarled as she rolled over to watch her friend taking her own son's semen on her tongue. "Go on, Marjorie, wank it out of him, drink his spunk." 

 "God," I heard my mother mutter. "I'm damned anyway. I've touched his cock and tasted his semen." And then she closed her eyes and took my oozing cock end between her lips. 

 "No!" I gasped. "She's sucking me. I can't ... Mum ... Mum, you're sucking me." 

 "I bloody well know," my mother replied as my penis slid out of her mouth. "I know I was sucking your cock." She rose upright and pulled the nightgown up over her head. "Now I want to fuck it," she added as she then, naked, pushed at Carolyn. "Get off the bed. Let me lie down." Then, when Carolyn had rolled off the bed, my mother looked at me. I saw her lying there, legs wide to reveal the gash of her cunt, hot and wet in the nest of her pubic bush. "Do it, Eric," my mother said as she grimaced at me with clenched teeth. "Fuck me." 

 Dazed by this latest twist, I clambered between her legs. "Your mother, Eric," Carolyn muttered. I looked up to see my lover mauling her tits with one hand, while she rubbed between her legs with the other. Lust twisted her face as she stared down, her bottom lip between her teeth and her eyes half-closed and glazed over. "Just like we pretended. Fuck her. Fuck your mum and watch her face when you fill her up with your cock." 

 I shuffled on my knees until the tip of my penis touched the scarlet heat of my mother's sex. Swallowing hard, I looked at her, stared into my mother's eyes, pausing on the brink of uncertainty. 

 "I want you to do it, Eric," my mother said in a voice so quiet I barely heard. "Put it in. Do it to me. Do it to me just like you do with Carolyn. Be mine, Eric. Be my son and love me." 

 "I do love you, Mum," I gasped. 

 "Then show me, darling. Show me how much you love your mum." 

 "Fuck," Carolyn sighed when I slumped forward. "You dirty pair of fuckers," she breathed. 

 My mother's eyes went wide as I slid into her body. Her arms reached around my neck and she held me there, deep inside her body with her legs wrapped around my waist. 

 "I've got him, Carolyn," my mother groaned. "All of him. I've got his love and his lovely big cock." 

 "You're fucking your son, Marjorie," Carolyn moaned, incredulous, as though she couldn't believe her own eyes, even though she'd goaded us to it. "Eric, that's your mum's cunt." 

 And then she came, her eyes closing as she slumped to the floor, her hand still rubbing vigorously. 

 I thrust into my mother as she jerked her hips and rose up to meet me. Like Carolyn said, I looked into her face and saw her watching me. 

 "What have we done, Eric?" she sighed. "Oh, God, what have we done? My son, my own son, doing this with me ..." 

 I groaned and felt another orgasm flare so close on the comet tail of the last. 

 "Mum," I grunted. 

 The kiss, as I came, with what semen my drained balls could summon spitting into my mother's body, I found more intimate and personal than mere sexual intercourse. Kissing my mother's mouth, with our tongues sliding around like lovers, filled me with such an arterial burst of love that I collapsed on top of her as tears pricked my eyes. 

 "Don't be sorry, Mum," I gasped. "Please, don't be sorry about this." 

 "I'm not, my baby," my mother whispered. "I love you, and I love feeling you so big and hard inside me." 

 "Are we going to do it again?" I asked. 

 The woman beneath me nodded. "Oh yes," she hissed, smiling up at me before we kissed again. 

 "Let me in," Carolyn said in a small voice as she stood at the lonely edge of my tiny bed. "I want to feel loved too." 

 "You are, darling, Mum replied. "And especially if you lick me and give me a beautiful orgasm." 

 "Move," Carolyn," said as she pushed at me. 

 I got out of the way and then I knelt next to the bed, watching my mother's face while Carolyn tongued jizm from my mother's body. 

 "Kiss me, Eric," Mum said just before she climaxed on Carolyn's creamy tongue. "Kiss your mother when she comes." 

 Scarborough 

 The man regarded us out of a lugubrious face as we stood there and waited for him to speak. He looked at the two women briefly and then turned his attention to me. Despite my youth I was the man of the party, and as such, would be the one the hotel clerk would address. 

 He fixed me with a rheumy-eyed stare and said, "I'm not sure." He glanced again at my mother and Carolyn who were waiting patiently with our baggage at their feet. "It isn't really a room for three," the man added. 

 I could see he was about to shake his head and refuse to admit us, hopes of a room at the Lord Nelson hotel faded. We could pay for two rooms, just, but the stretch on our resources would curb our enjoyment on that late summer weekend. 

 Carolyn stepped forward. "Excuse me," she said as she placed a hand on the man's bony wrist. 

 Five minutes later we were shown a room at the top of the hotel, facing the seafront no less, and then I spent an energetic ten minutes huffing and puffing up and down the narrow stairs. First I collected our cases, two journeys to the top floor of the building, while Next came a heavy contraption of springs and a frame, a complicated arrangement of a folding bed borrowed from the hotel. The bed possessed all the menace of a bear trap, with its hinges and folding parts, and even the mattress proved awkward as I dragged its reluctant bulk up stairs and around difficult corners on the landing, the damned thing refusing to cooperate with me like a recalcitrant child being dragged to school. 

 Eventually, after all that effort, we were in. 

 "Charm," Carolyn smiled when I mentioned the hotel clerk's unwillingness to rent us a room for the weekend. 

 My mother laughed. "Buckets of it, Carolyn," she said. 

 I shook my head, amazed and delighted at the blonde's powers of persuasion. "I thought he wasn't going to let us have a room, for certain." 

 Carolyn smiled and sat on the double bed. She bounced up and down, testing the springs. "It'll be a bit tight for three." She looked at me with an amused smirk. "You'll have to have the put-me-up bed, Eric." 

 Eyeing the menacing arrangement lurking in a corner of the spacious room I sighed and shrugged. 

 "Would you like to sleep with me?" my mother asked -- a rhetorical question these days. Completely uninhibited now that the three of us were lovers, my mother slipped out of the dress she'd worn for the journey. "I'm just off for a bath before we go for our walk." 

 I caught a quick glimpse of her bare buttocks before she wrapped a towel around her body. "Do you want me to scrub your back, Mum?" I asked. 

 "Give me ten minutes," she replied before opening the door and walking out onto the landing. 

 "You dirty bugger," Carolyn said with a smile. "You're at her all the time." 

 "You get your share." I winked at the woman as she too undressed. 

 Carolyn stood there and flaunted her big breasts. She walked to the window and looked out across the sands and the shimmering North Sea. "As long as I do get my share, Eric," she replied. 

 I went to her and wrapped my arms around her middle. She sighed and held my forearms, squeezing them tight around her body. My cock stiffened quickly, and I considered the attractions of Carolyn's voluptuous curves, even thinking about sliding my erection into her from behind as we stood at the window. 

 Reading my mind, Carolyn murmured, "Your mum'll be waiting." 

 I gently eased Carolyn around so she faced me. We kissed, long and tender, lingering at the window with our tongues entwined while I stroked Carolyn's breasts and she squeezed the stiffness throbbing in my trousers. 

 She broke away and moved to the bed. "Quickly," Carolyn gasped as she lay back and opened her legs. "Before you go to her, kiss me some more ... Down there." 

 I settled, still fully clothed, between my lover's thighs and licked at her, and soon had the woman writhing and moaning. 

 Carolyn came. She stiffened and then let out a huge gasp. I eased myself off the bed and looked at her while she shuddered and writhed. 

 "Go," she panted. "I'll bathe afterwards. I'm going to lie here and play with myself. All this sunshine and excitement about this weekend has made me feel very fruity. Go on," Carolyn insisted with a flick of her hand towards the door. "We've got all the time in the world to be together." 

 After kicking off my shoes I took a towel and left Carolyn alone in the room. I walked along the landing and stopped outside the door to the bathroom. I knocked tentatively. 

 The door opened after I heard the bolt snick open on the other side. My mother's head appeared, her body hidden while steam billowing around her. 

 We were kissing as soon as I'd stepped inside and the bolt had slid home again. 

 "Get out of those clothes," my mother panted. I stripped quickly, leaving my clothes piled on the lino flooring. 

 The small bathroom had been big enough for my mother to kneel and suck my cock as the huge taps pumped gallons of hot water into a claw-footed bath. The bath itself took up half the room, and seemed as big as a rowing boat, easily big enough for two. 

 "Mum," I moaned when my mother fixed her eyes on mine. Her lips stretched around my girth, while the cock-head inside her mouth bulged against one cheek.  

 

 

===

She let the length of me plop from her lips. "What, darling?" she asked. "Don't you like it when I suck your cock?" 

 I still wasn't used to hearing my own mother use language like that, and every time she spoke about sucking cock or fucking or how good Carolyn's cunt tasted when she came, a thrill surged through my veins. 

 "I love it, Mum," I sighed, removing my mother's hand so I could and hold my penis and stroke my own length. "I can't believe that we're actually doing this. Me and you and Carolyn." 

 "Don't think about it, Eric," my mother said as she watched my hand move. "It happened. I'm not sure myself how it all came about, but we're here now. I don't think about it, I just want to enjoy it. I love you ... I love Carolyn, and you love both of us ..." 

 And then she took my hand away from my erection. My mother licked and massaged me until I felt the incredible surge of my orgasm curl my toes. 

 "Fuck," I moaned and then squirted my relief all over the lino. 

 Spunk jetted from the eye of my cock, raining down onto the floor while my mother's hand worked quickly, pumping me as semen slid over her wrist and hand. 

 When the spurting tapered to a dribble, my mother licked and sucked at the residue, and then grinned at me as she rose to her feet. 

 "Do you have enough energy, Eric?" She reached to turn off the taps. "Can you manage to fuck me even though you've just made such a mess?" 

 I fucked my mother as she leaned over the bath, her hands pressed against the far wall. It was hot work, sweat streaming off me from the heat of the day outside and the steam in the bathroom. Holding my mother's hips, I stabbed at her, using my hard cock as a weapon to plunge into her body time and again. 

 My mother gasped and sighed, pushing her hips back at me while I thrust hard and relentless. 

 "Yes," she panted. "That's it. That's just what I need. Love me later, Eric. Just fuck me now, my darling. Fuck me like I need to be fucked. Give me that lovely cock." 

 The doorknob rattled before someone knocked at the door. 

 "It's occupied," Mum called out as I paused mid-stroke. 

 Carolyn's voice came from outside. "It's me." 

 I slid my length from my mother's body. "Hurry up," she snapped. "Let her in and then put that thing back inside me. I need to climax soon." 

 With Carolyn inside and the door bolted, I had soon returned to my thrusting and grunting while my cock split my mother's cunt. 

 The blonde sat on the edge of the bath and, naked, watched as she fingered herself. 

 I could feel my mother's fingernails scraping my cock as she rubbed herself to a climax. 

 "I'm going to do it," she gasped before her head lolled forward and her body began to judder. 

 A cry came from Carolyn. Me too!" she shouted. "I'm fucking coming as well." 

 Anyone could have heard us groaning and calling out if they'd been walking past that door, and I'd been surprised that the hotel clerk didn't come running to investigate. Instead of being caught out by any hotel staff or guests, the two women climaxed, one clenching around my penis while the other squelched her fingers into her sodden opening. 

 We shared a bath; two of us in the tub at a time while the other soaped and rinsed the bathers. Eventually, pink and wrinkled from immersion, I left the women alone and scuttled furtively along the landing to the bedroom. 

 The women returned ten minutes later. We dressed, Carolyn in a blue dress while Mum looked gorgeous in bright, summery yellow dress, a vivid canary that complimented her tanned arms and shapely legs. 

 Carolyn, with her cleavage plunging, daring and provocative in those times, picked up her boxy camera and we all traipsed down the stairs and out into the sunshine of a Saturday afternoon. 

 On the sand, with the sea in front of us, Carolyn used her charm on a strolling gentleman who, after a good, long stare down the blonde's vertiginous cleavage, said he'd be only too happy to snap our photograph for posterity. 

 Epilogue 

 The weekend at Scarborough proved to be the beginning of a relationship between the three of us that lasted until Carolyn passed away in 1999. Mother went in 1974 following a mercifully short illness. 

 Carolyn and I lived together in the terraced house until my fortieth birthday, when, after taking up the option to buy the place from the council not long before, I sold up and we moved to Scarborough. 

 I found the photograph that triggered my reverie tucked under a tray in Carolyn's jewellery box, and then spent the afternoon wandering along the sea front in front of the Lord Nelson reliving that weekend. But now it's time for a pint of beer in the bar, where I can think about kissing Carolyn that first time, and where I can picture the scenes that played out in the bedroom at the top of the hotel, the three of us, together. And the years we had afterwards. Report_Story
