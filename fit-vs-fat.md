 (Shannon) 

 I had been told Alexis was the best personal trainer in town. My best friend Heidi had recommended her, and since I had seen the results first hand, I believed her. Heidi had dropped about 30 pounds since she'd started training with her, and had gone from having a few spare pounds to looking trim, tight, and hot. Heidi had gone from struggling to get guys to having multiple guys vying for her affections. I was envious of all the attention she was now getting, and that probably contributed to my decision to seek out a personal trainer so I could lose weight. But I wasn't doing this to get a boyfriend. I didn't have to worry about that. I was already married. 

 I had met Ben in college, at the gym ironically enough. I would never claim to be a gym freak, but I liked to keep myself fit. It was as I ran around the track that I got talking to this absolute hunk. I could tell just by looking at him that he spent a lot of time at the gym. And the gym had treated him well. His body was chiseled, and I almost drooled when I saw him with his shirt off. His face held up its end of the bargain; he was gorgeous! He had a youthful, friendly face, and a shaggy hair-do that made him seem a little wild, a little rebellious. 

 I saw a bunch of girls vying for his attention, but he brushed them off deftly. I couldn't blame him. They were the typical trashy gym rats, who use going to the gym as an excuse to dress like a skank. That wasn't my thing. I dressed in clothes a normal, healthy girl would wear. I got the impression that that wasn't his type of girl, and he was used to brushing them off. I had the feeling he was looking for a nice, regular girl. A girl like me. Plus, I knew I looked darn cute in my gym clothes, so I didn't feel too out of my league by making conversation with him. 

 Luckily for me, we hit it off! Watching the shocked looks on those gym skanks faces as me and Ben walked out together was one of the best moments of my life. As I got to know Ben, I realized he was no meathead. He was something more. He was an athlete, but he didn't let that stop him pursuing a degree. He had gotten a football scholarship, but he had torn up his knee during his sophomore year, effectively ending any hope he had of going pro. I don't think he would have gone pro even if he hadn't been hurt; it would have been a waste of his intelligence. He was smart, articulate, and a hard worker. He told me over coffee that he wanted to be a teacher. He was perfect. I was smitten right away. 

 I was nowhere near as fit as he was. It would be hard to compare to him in that sense. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a girl with curves. Unfortunately, they were not the curves most girls wished for. Sure, my waistline had increased over the past few years, but that growth did not translate to my cup size. I had been firmly in an A-cup bra since I was 15. It had always been aggravating that my boobs just stopped growing. 

 I had always been self-conscious about my breast size. I hated to admit it, but I had always been jealous of girls with big boobs. I hated the way they would parade them around, and get all the boy's attention. I hated them, but I had to admit I would do the same if I had a big rack. Now, thinking about it, that may have been the start of my issues with weight. I think there was some part of me that wanted to gain weight in hopes my boobs would get bigger, but obviously, that's not really how it works. My weight had always fluctuated, and finally in college, I felt like I had finally matured into a healthy, curvy frame that I felt suited me well. Sure, I had a few extra pounds, but I was not going to let myself be one of those skinny little bitches. I had always been told I was stunningly pretty. I would admit I had a pretty face, and I always kept my blonde hair fashionable. Plus, I was fun to be around. And also, a lot of guys like a nice, big butt. I was a real woman, and I found a guy that appreciated it. 

 My affection towards Ben grew the longer we were together. My friends didn't believe me, but we never fought. We were both too easy going to raise our voices or get mad at each other. We were a perfect match. 

 We married when we were both 25. I could tell a lot of my friends were envious that I had landed such a catch. I had overheard some conversations about how a fitness freak like him could be with a curvy girl like me. I always laughed when I heard this. Those girls that said stuff like that were all single while I was married, so they clearly didn't know what they were talking about. 

 Now, at 27, he looked as good as he did when I first met him. He was still as fit as he was during his college days. Unfortunately, the same could not be said about me. I don't know if I got complacent, or if it was just stress, but I had put on a few pounds. I wasn't fat or anything. I just had a few extra pounds. Typically, when I got stressed out, I ate. I was a stress eater. I was a manager in retail, so stress came often. 

 For awhile, I wondered if Ben was into girls with a little weight on them. I noticed that even though I had gained some weight, he was as interested in me as ever. But the more I thought about it, I realized he loved me for me, not my looks or body, which was great. But every so often, I got the impression that he wanted me to lose some weight. He would never be so blunt about it, he was too nice. He would ask if I wanted to run with him or go to the gym with him. It wasn't in a demanding way or anything like that, he was just offering. He cared about my health and well being. 

 So that's what brought me to today. I wanted to get back into my college shape for our third wedding anniversary. I had mentioned to him that I was interested in getting a personal trainer, and he volunteered to go to the trainer alongside me. He didn't need any help staying fit; he would just be there to support me. So I asked around, and came up with the name Alexis Winters. 

 Heidi had recommended her to me first, but I had heard her name from other people as well, and they all said the same thing; she was the best. 

 Alexis was a bit expensive, but I knew it would be worth it. I knew the only way I could succeed at losing weight was if I had someone motivating me, and I knew Ben would not have the time to be there as often as I would like, so I needed someone who would be there to help me as often as I needed. 

 I needed a personal trainer. 

 Now, I had also heard some rumors about Alexis Winters. Heidi had told me that I had to be tough and have a thick skin if I wanted to succeed with Alexis, and others had said much the same. From what I had been told, she was something of a harsh taskmaster. I was told that she and I would never be friends and that I wouldn't want to anyways, but she would get me to lose weight. That's good, because I wasn't looking for a friend. I was looking for someone to help me lose weight. 

 Besides, how bad could she be? 

 I had the day off, so I decided to schedule a meeting with Ms. Winters at the gym she ran to see if she would take me on as a client. 

 Alexis worked at one of those franchise gyms, called "Fitness Masters." It was nestled between a Starbucks and an Apple Store in the most upscale part of downtown, and from the look of the stylish black and white facade, fit right in. It looked as clean and new as the day it had been built. 

 Stepping through the precipice of the automatic door, I surveyed the expanse of the floor. It was the size of a warehouse, filled with an astonishing variety of gleaming, expensive looking, exercise equipment, almost every station occupied by young, attractive and obviously well off gym-rats, straining and stretching, huffing and puffing, working hard at maintaining their youthful vigor and attractiveness. 

 It was as I walked through the gym that I was reminded of the aspect of the gym I hated; the people. I could almost feel the other gym-goers staring at me with the arrogant, judgmental, eyes of youth, scoffing at me just because I had a few extra pounds and pale skin. I could feel a nervous sensation like butterflies in my stomach walking through the maze of tanned and toned gym- rats, suddenly feeling like I was an alien in unfamiliar terrain; that I didn't fit in here. 

 But I pushed those feelings aside, and reassured myself; there was only one person whose opinion I cared about, that that was Ben. I refrained from making eye contact and made my way back to where the trainer's offices were. 

 I checked in with the secretary, a pretty little thing who rudely eyed me up and down when I'd told her I was here for an appointment, and after a few minutes wait, I was told that Alexis was waiting. I walked down a hallway until I saw her name next to an open door. I walked in too introduce myself. 

 Walking through the door, I surveyed her office. It was sparsely populated, evidence that she spent little time actually in the small room, nothing on the walls, nothing on the desk other than her laptop; no pictures of family or personal items. There were a couple of cabinets and a closet, but other than that, the office was devoid of any sort of character or personality; it felt cold and impersonal. The small room was very utilitarian; every object served a specific purpose and there was nothing extraneous or frivolous. 

 I knocked tentatively, drawing the attention of the woman sitting behind the desk, lazily working on her computer. She looked up at me as I entered. 

 "Alexis?" I inquired, that feeling of butterflies returning. She stood from behind her desk, allowing me to take her in for the first time. I was immediately startled by how voluptuous she was. I know saying someone is voluptuous can sometimes imply they have a few extra pounds, and Alexis did...in a way. Unlike me, though, who had some extra pounds on my waist and stomach, all of her extra weight seemed to have gone to her tits. I couldn't help but openly gawk at them. They were absolutely massive; just huge! 

 Alexis' impressive breasts stretched the tight tank top that adorned them to the max, almost threatening to burst free from the restrictive material which struggled to contain them. 

 Like I said, all of her extra weight went to her tits, because as my gaze drifted south, taking in the rest of her curvaceous form, there was not a bit of fat to be found on her. 

 Her exposed belly showed off smooth, taught, abs and an almost impossibly trim waist, which seemed at odds with the wide, dynamic, curve of her hips. She had long, tan, firmly muscled, legs, left exposed by her tight exercise shorts. Her arms looked firm and strong, her biceps tight, her shoulders solid. She wasn't too muscular, like a lot of those female bodybuilders. She was fit but she still maintained her feminine curvature. Her body was clearly in shape, but she still maintained the softness that was attractive to men. Her body was, in a word, perfect...ideal even. 

 I tore my eyes away from my assessment to look up to her face just in time for her to greet me. I blushed slightly, all to aware that I'd lingered on her for too long. 

 "Hello," she announced impassively. No smile crossed her lips, and her dull grey eyes were cold, lifeless, and unblinking, staring penetratingly into my own, unreadable. My immediate impression was that she seemed cold and disinterested; bored even. There was no fire or light of any kind behind those eyes, which was a shame since she was absolutely beautiful. She had a gorgeous face, her smoky eyes seemed to invoke mystery, her lips plump and full, a perfect shade of pink; she had the kind of beauty that required no makeup to enhance. She wasn't a woman like me, who had to spend 30 minutes in front of a mirror each morning to make sure her makeup looked perfect. Her bronzed skin was perfectly tanned all over, adding to her allure, as she seemed to almost glow against the cold fluorescent light that illuminated her office, a stark contrast to dullness of her eyes. Her dark brunette hair was long and shined like satin as it moved animatedly, brushing her shoulders. It didn't look styled, as if she had spent hours in a salon. She didn't have to bother. She was one of those girls who was blessed with great hair. Falling in waves past her shoulders, mostly straight but with a bit of a curl, not overly styled or fussed with, just naturally perfect. 

 It was a little bit unnerving that a woman so naturally gifted with beauty would project such a cold and off putting aura, but I was told to expect that about Alexis; she's all business. 

 She turned and walked back to her desk as she motioned for me to sit down. This allowed me a quick glance at her butt, and I shook my head once I saw it. It was perfection, much like the rest of her. A perfect, firm, heart shaped ass that rode high and tight, begging to be appreciated as it rolled teasingly from side to side. Her body was unbelievable. If her training could enable me to get anywhere close to that body, then it would be well worth the money, worth the sweat, worth the tears, worth ANYTHING. Her body was proof positive of how good she was at her job; she was a walking testament to her own dedication and expertise. 

 "Hi!" I said brightly, hoping to make a good impression. 

 "How can I help you, Mrs. Hallaway?" Alexis asked, her smooth voice blasé, her lids heavy with disinterest. Frankly, I was a bit offended. 

 "Well, I am hoping to trim a little fat and get down to my college weight for my anniversary." I explained. She lazily looked me up and down, quickly assessing my figure through my bulky clothing. 

 "Okay, so about 30-40 pounds then?" she asked. 

 "Well, I don't know if I need to lose that much..." I started, slightly perturbed; just how much did she think I weighed? 

 "Mrs. Hallaway, I know what I am doing. If you want your husband to be impressed, you need to get nice and trim. Losing about 40 pounds will do the trick," Alexis replied with that same impassive monotone, uninterested in arguing with me. 

 "Well, I'm only about 15 or 20 pounds above my college weight. That's my goal," I replied firmly, the corners of my lips turning down a little. Alexis paused for a second, as if debating whether she wanted to say something, but she let it pass. 

 "Okay. Well, I run a few different types of training. The type I would recommend would be for us to meet four times a week, two hours per session. I will run you through a strenuous program that will work every part of your body, and like you said, 'trim the fat'. I will also put you on a strict diet and suggest things you can do on your own time to help lose weight. I have some paperwork here that lays out the types of things I will be doing," she droned on, sliding some papers across the table, "Look them over and if you make a decision to work with me, call the number here on the bottom and we can set it up. I will warn you, though, that I am in high demand, so if you want to do this, it would be best if you made your decision quickly." 

 I took the papers and quickly shuffled through them; I would have to read them in detail with Ben later, as he was the expert on this kind of thing. Thinking about Ben reminded me of an important stipulation I'd left out. 

 "Also, my husband will be accompanying me to our sessions...as support. He doesn't really need the help, but he wants to be there for me," I stated firmly. Alexis held my gaze with those cold eyes of hers, as she considered this. It seemed like she was debating whether it was worth her trouble, as she mulled it over. 

 "Okay," she finally concluded, "I must warn you that I will charge double if I am dealing with two people, though" Alexis warned. I had worked extra shifts to get some spending money for this endeavor, so that is where the money was coming from for this. I had enough to meet her rates. 

 "Okay, thank you," I replied, relived, and could sense our meeting was over, "I'll get back to you soon." 

 I stood, and she just looked at me as I awkwardly waited for a response that would never coming. I turned and walked out of the office, papers in hand. 

 As I got in my car, I was a little thrown off by my meeting with Alexis. Her cold disinterest was unnerving and off putting. She was unreadable and it seemed like talking with me bored her immensely; like it was a burden to interact with people at all. I had heard she was not easy to get along with, but she was good at her job, and looking at her body, that was evidence enough to convince me that she knew what she was doing. If I could look half as good as her, Ben would positively ravish me! 

 This provoked a rather unsettling thought, in hind sight; did I want my husband in such close quarters with a woman as voluptuous and sexy as Alexis? Would it be a good idea to have my husband exercising in the vicinity of woman with such huge attention grabbing boobs, a perfect, irresistible, ass, and a gorgeous, captivating, face, wearing such tight workout clothes? 

 I absolutely trusted him, really I did, but still, as a woman, I was hesitant to allow my husband to spend time with a woman as gorgeous as Alexis. 

 But I would be there too, and Ben was too good of a man to have a wandering eye. And besides, if her cold disinterest had been off putting to me, it was sure to unnerve Ben. Ben liked fun, peppy women, like me. By comparison, Alexis seemed like sort of a downer. 

 But still, part of me just wanted to call the whole thing off and find a different trainer, but I had already kinda put all my eggs in one basket in going with Alexis, and if I wanted to be in shape in time for our anniversary, I would have to start training immediately. 

 ********** 

 After dinner, I had Ben look through the papers Alexis had given me. He had put on his reading glasses to flip through the papers, his brow furrowing in concentration as he skimmed through the documents. I always thought he looked cute in his glasses. As he read the papers, I reached around his broad shoulders and rubbed his chest as I kissed the back of his head. 

 "What do you think?" I inquired, looking over his shoulder and nuzzling the back of his neck. 

 "She seems like she knows what she's talking about it," Ben grunted, flipping to the next page, his eyes darting quickly across the page, soaking up the information. 

 "You know, I was thinking, you don't have to come help me at the gym. I can do this myself..." I ventured, still a little hesitant to have him around the sexy personal trainer. 

 "I made a promise to you that I'd be there. You don't have to be nervous having me around," he reassured me with a laugh, adding, "You have nothing to be embarrassed about." 

 "I know..." I pouted, slightly irked by his comment about me being embarrassed; embarrassed about what? "It's not that, it's just this is something I want to do myself. Besides, it costs double for the both of us." 

 "I tell you what," he started, "You can do this on your own, but I will try to show up every so often to help out." 

 "I guess..." I agreed hesitantly, still not crazy about this compromise, but he was too sweet to let me do this alone; he wanted to support me in any way he could, whether I wanted it or not. He stood and got behind me. 

 "What's wrong?" he inquired, kissing my neck. Ben was a sensitive man, and sensed my reservation. He could always read me like a book. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© "Nothing!" I giggled as his lips brushed against my sensitive neck. Ben knew just where to kiss, applying gentle pressure to the ticklish little spot at the nap of my neck; a spot only he knew about, having discovered it after hours of necking in our youth. He knew just how to get me going; all the right places to kiss, the right parts to caress. I could feel that familiar slow heat begin to radiate through my flushed body as he pressed himself firmly against me. I could feel his hard dick rubbing insistently against the generous curve of my ass. One good thing about him was that it wasn't just his muscles that were big. I thoroughly enjoyed sex with Ben, and it would be hard not to, with that 10-inch dick he had that was now throbbing hot and hard against me. 

 "I've been thinking about you all day," he whispered, nipping playfully at my ear. 

 "I can tell," I cooed seductively, invitingly, sliding my hand down over the straining bulge in his pants. With that, he spun me around and with a manly grunt reached around my waist, and lifted me over his shoulder. I laughed loudly as he carried me towards the bedroom. I loved when he took control like this. I loved those flashes of wildness that occasionally escaped his normally calm exterior. I loved that wild, masculine part of him that was ready to take me to our bed and claim me as his woman once again. 

 ********** 

 "Huge boobs!" Ben screamed out. 

 "No, you idiot! Let me finish!" I said with a laugh, continuing to draw. 

 Among our friends, the first Friday of every month was game night. This was all Ben's idea, since he loved to play games. He was an overgrown kid at heart. We would switch who hosted the parties and what games we played. 

 This week, it was us and two other couples. My friend Heidi and her boyfriend Will were hosting the party this week. Also, Ben's friend John, and his wife, Jessica were here. The game was Pictionary. I was drawing a car, and I accidentally drew the wheels a bit too big, making them look like boobs. I drew the rest of the chassis. 

 "Car!" Ben called out. I pointed at him, telling him he got it correct. I added a plus sign to the drawing and drew a musical note. I saw Ben's cute face scrunch up in concentration, and then I saw the light switch flip on. 

 "Cartoon?" he said. 

 "Booya!" I exclaimed, with a laugh, "I think we won this one." 

 Usually, we didn't win during these get-togethers, but finally, we won this one. I high-fived Ben on my way to taking my place beside him on the couch. I heard the couch strain under my weight, and hoped no one else did. I knew it was nothing, that it would do the same with anyone that sat on it. But still. 

 After game night, we settled down with a few drinks and just chilled out. Heidi went to grab more drinks as we sat and started to chat. 

 Will had been dating Heidi for about six months. Heidi was a coffee barista, and she met Will when he came in to get a latte. He was a good guy, and he fit right in during game night, but we hadn't quite become great friends yet. Not as good of friends as Ben and John. John had moved to the area about a year ago, and he worked at the same school as Ben. John and Ben were fast friends. His wife Jessica was very pregnant, almost fit to burst. She was a gorgeous woman, and even being pregnant with twins she still looked great...I couldn't help but be a little jealous of her pretty face and sumptuous cleavage. She was a doctor, and apparently a really good one at that. I got along with her fine, but it always felt like she was putting up a façade. She was friendly enough, but to me, it seemed like an act. She often couldn't make it due to her busy schedule, but she did her best to attend. 

 "So, Shannon, when do you start with Alexis?" Heidi inquired, re-entering the room with a tray of drinks, which she set down on the coffee table. 

 "Monday," I said. 

 "Who's Alexis?" John asked, interest piqued. 

 "She's a personal trainer," Heidi answered for me, "She whipped me back into shape, and she's gonna do the same with Shannon here." 

 I quietly admired the new Heidi. She used to be a bit of a pushover, but since she lost weight, she was a whole new woman. She was fit, assertive, and confident. She seemed to have the room in the palm of her hand wherever she went. 

 "Are you talking about Alexis Winters?" Jessica suddenly interjected. 

 "Yeah. You know her?" I questioned, shocked to find how prescient Alexis name was. Since hearing about her, it suddenly seemed like everyone knew her. 

 "Yeah, she's a friend of mine. I like her," Jessica said with a sly smile, flashing those perfect teeth of hers, "I'll probably see her after I pop these babies out. Need to lose the baby weight for my man," she laughed, tugging on John's arm, drawing him in for a playful kiss, which quickly grew wet and sloppy as they lingered on it, making it awkward for everyone in the room. Their lips parted, and Jessica again laughed, "He's gonna want me back in action as soon as possible." 

 "I got a strange vibe from her," I ventured, hoping to gauge Heidi and Jessica's experiences with Alexis against my own. 

 "Oh, don't get me wrong, she's a complete bitch," Jessica chuckled lightly, "But I can admire fellow strong willed women. She's tough. I hope you can keep up with her." 

 "Me too," I replied, still uneasy. 

 ********** 

 The days passed quickly, and I soon found myself back at the gym, ready for my first session with Alexis. 

 As I waited for Alexis, I warmed up and stretched. This was my first day of training, and I was nervous about what she had in store for me. I had put on my exercise clothes, some tight, black stretch pants and a gray tank top, something that would allow me to work-out in comfort. I was bent over, touching my toes, when I heard the approaching footsteps. 

 "I can see where all your weight goes," Alexis quipped as she walked around me, calmly studying my form with those cold, calculating eyes of hers. 

 I stood up straight and looked at Alexis with a frown, more than a little offended; what was her problem? 

 I almost gasped when I laid eyes on her, a little shocked by what she was wearing. Her top was nothing more than a sports-bra that, while not overly skimpy, couldn't help but show off her incredible bust. Her impressive valley of cleavage was bared for the world to see. Her flat belly was left unclothed, her muscles evident while maintaining her feminine softness. She wore a small, tight, pair of spandex exercise shorts, which only just went below her ass- cheeks. The shorts had a strip of material on each side that had green, white, and blue stripes. Her long, firm legs led down to her cute pink and white sneakers. She was taller than me, imposingly so, so I had to look up to meet her eyes. 

 "Excuse me?" I asked. 

 "I said I saw where all your weight goes," Alexis repeated in that same, flat, matter-of-fact monotone. 

 "What do you mean by that?" I protested, my anger rising. 

 "I mean that you have a big ass," Alexis said bluntly, holding my gaze with those unblinking eyes, unwilling, or maybe just unable, to back down. 

 "How can you just say that to someone?" I spit at her, taken aback, my anger reaching a slow boil. 

 "That is why we are here, is it not?" she questioned, expression blank and looking little bored. 

 "Well, it's just, you shouldn't say..." I stammered, struggling to think of an appropriate argument. Her statement had an infallible logic to it, but her bluntness wasn't just off putting and insulting...it was downright mean. 

 She cut me off with a wave of her hand, "Okay, fine, whatever." 

 Alexis turned, leaving me hanging with my mouth open, full of impotent anger with nowhere to direct it, as Alexis seemed uninterested in continuing our argument. 

 Alexis sauntered over toward the scale which was set against the wall, "Alright, first things first, let us get you on the scale to find your base weight." 

 Alexis directed me towards the scale, and I stomped forward, determined to make her acknowledge my indignation, but she continued to ignore me. I had heard she was a bitch, and I was experiencing that first hand. I walked to the wall and stepped on the scale. She adjusted the scale before speaking, as I glowered at her. 

 "Okay, you are 5' 5", and you weigh 145 lbs. The average weight for a woman your height is about 135, but I think if we shoot for you losing 20 lbs, that will get you nice and trim for your hubby," Alexis droned in her bored monotone, barely engaging me in a discussion about my own body. Who did she think she was to dictate to me when I was the one paying her! 

 "I'm just shooting to lose about 10, 15 lbs, so let's just get there and then we'll see," I replied, hoping that Alexis would catch on to the venom dripping from my voice and start to shape up; instead she just rolled her eyes. 

 "Fine, what do I know? I am just a professional trainer with three years of College, a Bachelors in physiology, and five years experience...what could I possibly know about what is best for your body that you obviously do not know," Alexis retorted sarcastically. 

 It was my turn to roll my eyes as I stepped off the scale, but I held my tongue. I was already committed to at least this lesson and I wanted my money's worth. Alexis didn't know it, but she was on thin ice with me already, but if she thought that she was going to drive me away before we even started our first session and keep the money I'd already paid up front, she had underestimated my resolve. I was no quitter; not now, not ever! 

 "So, what first?" I challenged, meeting those unnerving, staring eyes of hers. As she looked down at me, I could tell already that she didn't like me; well the feeling was mutual, bitch. But, if I lost the weight, I didn't care what she thought of me or what I thought of her. This was just another hurdle between me and my goal of reaching my ideal weight, and I intended to succeed. 

 "Treadmill," she stated simply, indicating toward the row of stationary treadmills with a smooth jerk of her neck. 

 I followed her to the treadmill and I stepped onto it. She adjusted the settings and turned it on. I began to jog at a nice steady place and Alexis excused herself, mumbling something about paperwork and checking up on me in a few minutes. I was frankly glad to see her leave, if only for awhile. I zoned out, as I normally do when I work out, focusing on just running and breathing rather than the passage of time. I was in the zone until Alexis's voice interrupted. 

 "Wow! Look at all that jiggle!" she called out flatly to me. I shot her a scowling death stare, and she just gave me a look that dared me to fight back. I grit my teeth. I would not let myself be dragged down to her level. 

 Alexis pressed a button on the controls in front of me and the pace of the treadmill sped up, "You're body is used to this pace; if you want to lose weight in the time allotted, you're going to have to push yourself; dig deep and work hard...if you're able to, that is," she mocked skeptically. I could only grunt in retort, concentrating on keeping up with the increased pace. I could feel sweat begging to bead on my forehead, and was embarrassed to feel the increased impact of my feet reverberate in my thighs, confirming Alexis' earlier observation. This bitch was doing this on purpose, to prove some insane point to me...to test my resolve. 

 Alexis observed me with casual interest now. It seemed like she found either my determination amusing, or the way my body moved. Yeah, real fucking hilarious, whore. 

 "I can see why you want to lose weight. This cannot be a tantalizing sight to the opposite sex. I would be worried about losing my man if I was in your position as well," Alexis remarked coolly, egging me on. I ran harder, as she added, "I have my work cut out for me." 

 Things didn't improve when I moved on to the exercise bike. Between the running and the pedaling, I was already soaked with sweat; this was a lot more intense than my regular workout, and my stamina was waning; but I refused to give Alexis the satisfaction and ask for a break. She eyes the growing stain on my back and the beads dripping down my forehead critically; my breathing was becoming ragged, and I wheezed audibly now. 

 "Out of breath already?" Alexis feigned concern, testing me. Still no reaction from me. 

 "Just imagine you are riding to a bakery or the candy store," Alexis mocked, "I'm sure you know where they are." 

 "THAT'S ENOUGH!" I screeched, finally fed up, "I've had enough of this bullshit! I don't need to hear this! You're supposed to be encouraging me, you horrible bitch!" 

 She looked at me, and I would dare to say she might have been a little impressed, as I saw the dimpled corner of her full lips lift slightly in a satisfied smirk. 

 "Okay, times up for today. I will see you tomorrow," she replied calmly, turning her back to me and walking away. I looked up at the clock on the wall and realized that our first session had indeed already passed; I had just made it. 

 I went to the locker room and quickly changed, not wanting to run into Alexis, I decided to forgo a shower and have one when I got home instead. My hair was a sweaty, matted, mess, and my body was sticky with sweat. My legs throbbed with a dull ache as I walked to my car. Despite this, I felt good; energized. Despite Alexis terrible attitude and horrible remarks, or maybe because of them, I felt like I had accomplished something. 

 I had endured. 

 ********** 

 I was fuming about her as I drove home. My suspicions had been confirmed. I now understood what Heidi and Jessica had said; Alexis was one grade-A bitch. She was demanding. She was mean. Her snotty little comments were cruel and unnecessary. 

 "I don't know if I can keep doing this," I fumed to Ben as we ate dinner that night. 

 "I think you're over-exaggerating," Ben said cautiously. He didn't like to contradict me, especially when I was passionate about something. Ben wasn't great with conflict, and chose to avoid it. Sometimes it was sweet, and other times it was frustrating. 

 "No, you weren't there. She's evil. She said some awful things to me," I pouted, justifying my dislike of her. 

 "Well, how do you feel?" Ben asked. 

 "Angry. Isn't that clear?" I retorted sarcastically. 

 "No, I mean physically, how do you feel?" Ben asked calmly. 

 "I am pretty sore, I guess. It was a good workout," I begrudgingly admitted. It was frustrating to admit that Alexis had been a harsh, but effective, taskmaster. The workout had worn me out. I was sore, but a good sore. She really pissed me off, but that did motivate me to work harder. Maybe that was her method? Maybe she was simply doing it to motivate me. 

 "Maybe you should stick with it, and if you still feel the same way, then move on. Don't let one tough day get you down," Ben encouraged, as he picked up the dishes and began clearing the table. He put his hand under my chin and brought his lips to mine. 

 I looked up at him. I was so in love with him. I would do anything for him. I could stick it out, for him. I could lose this weight. I could put up with that bitch. 

 ********** 

 "Come on, fat ass! Get going!" Alexis barked. I shot daggers at her with my eyes. 

 We were running laps on the track, and she did not look the least bit winded as she ran. She ran backwards as she barked insults at me. No one batted an eye as she called me 'Fat-Ass' or 'Thunder-Thighs.' They just kept running; but I could see the smirks on their smug faces as they passed...hear the whispered laughs. I just shook my head and picked up the pace. 

 Alexis had missed her calling as a drill instructor. That is what this felt like. Boot camp. And she was the remorseless hard ass in charge, "Keep up Cupcake...if you can!" 

 We later moved on to the weights, and as I was curling a dumbbell, Alexis again felt the need to chime in with some more 'encouragement.' 

 "Just imagine you are lifting an ice cream cone to your mouth. Come on, it is pretty obvious you gorge yourself regularly with sugary treats," Alexis teased. The less I reacted to her, the more she'd provoke me. It was like some terrible game to her. 

 I even started to feel her influence when she wasn't around. Whenever I would think about cheating on my diet, her voice and the countless insults that would spew forth from that sewage pipe she called a mouth if she knew convinced me otherwise. I was eating the foods she wanted me to eat in order to lose weight. That was why it was infuriating when I got on the scale, with Alexis by my side, and discovered I had not lost a pound. 

 "Are you fucking serious?" Alexis exclaimed, "Are you even trying? Are you even taking this seriously?" 

 "Yeah, I am. I am doing everything you said," I replied meekly. She looked absolutely furious with me, and I could offer no defense; the scale didn't lie. 

 

 This gave her the excuse to ride me twice as hard as normal. I had to run at twice the speed, for twice the distance on the treadmill. And she was twice as mean. 

 "Look at you...wheezing! I want you to run so hard you puke. Come on! I run faster and farther than this every day! What you're doing here is a fucking breeze! Anybody who is even slightly in shape could do this without breaking a sweat. God, you are pathetic. COME...ON!" she yelled at me, terrorizing me with her words. 

 I ran literally as hard as I could. And true to her word, she didn't let up until I had to run to the bathroom to puke. It was then that she finally called it a day. 

 I was feeling pretty rough for the rest of the day; nauseous and weak in the knees. I knew I wanted to lose weight, but, more importantly, I would show this bitch how dedicated I was. I vowed to myself, that by the end of this, I would be even more fit and attractive than she was. 

 And I had to begrudgingly admit; that was really saying something. 

 ********** 

 (Alexis) 

 I dislike just about everyone. And I enjoy that fact about myself. I do not have many friends; only acquaintances. And, honestly, I do not really care about any of them. If I did not have to deal with anyone on a regular basis, I would be perfectly fine. I mainly kept what little 'friends' I had to keep up appearances, as with many other things in my life. And again, I like this aspect of myself. Why? It's quite simple: I am a narcissistic sociopath. 

 As long as I could remember, I felt different. While the other children I grew up with made friends quickly, I felt no such compulsion. I did not understand the concept of companionship. I was perfectly happy to play by myself. I will admit there was some lashing out on my part. I was a terror to be around even at a young age. I was a bully, and I was mean. I dominated those around me; child or adult. Can you blame me? I was smarter than them all. 

 My inability to connect with people, including family, worried my parents so much they took me to seek counseling. We finished these sessions, but the therapist did not tell me the conclusion he had drawn, answering only to my parents. It would be years before I discovered his diagnosis of my true nature. All I knew was after these counseling sessions, my parents kept a wary eye on me; constantly trying to talk with me and get in my head. This was futile on their part though, as I quickly learned how to tell people what they wanted to hear. I was immutable and indecipherable, able to manipulate them as easily as a puppeteer pulls strings on a marionette. 

 I learned to make people dance for me. 

 To this end, I learned to be more closely guarded in my feelings. I stopped lashing out and began to internalize my feelings. My parents seemed happier with this perceived 'progress', which gave me more freedom. 

 Nothing restricted my movements. No one held me back. I freely pursued my desires at the expense of those around me. Emotional attachment was a weakness I did not possess. Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© I realized something was off about me after my first few years of school. I felt no connection or common bond with anyone. I did not understand how these other children functioned. How they interacted with one another; so I learned how to behave through imitation of others. 

 It was not until middle school that I finally learned the truth about myself. I was looking through a psychology book when I came across the term 'sociopath.' As I read through the symptoms, I realized it read as a description of myself. Aggressiveness. Lack of empathy or attachment to others. Shallow emotions. Lack of guilt. Superficial charm. A need for stimulation. Manipulative. An incapacity for love. It all fit. Reading this was the first time I felt what may be categorized as 'relief.' I knew what I was now. I knew what secret my parents and my therapist had been hiding from me. I was a sociopath. And nothing could have me...happier, if you want it in terms you can easily relate too. 

 But the narcissism; the grandiose sense of self; that would come later...along with the promiscuous sexual behavior. 

 I did not let my parents know what I now knew. I kept on pretending that all was well; that I was one of the 'normal' people; and nobody knew any better. 

 I would say that my lack of understanding of other people's feelings defined the person I became. I would spend a lot of time observing people, studying them, learning what made them tick. I became a student of human behavior and learned better how to control those around me and how to mimic that behavior when necessary; teaching myself to cry on demand was the hardest, but most effective means of manipulation. Thus, I was able to blend into the background in my formative years until something changed, something that forced me from the background and onto everyone's radar; I grew breasts. 

 This is where the narcissism came in. Over the summer going into my senior year of high-school, I went from a pair of humble B-Cups to a set of whopping, bulging, firm, DD's. I would admit I was already a good-looking girl; though experience taught me I was in fact beautiful; but along with my developing breasts, I filled out in all the right places, developing a dramatic and pleasing curvature. I matured over the summer looks-wise, and I went from a pretty, yet unassuming, wallflower to a voluptuous knockout. And people took notice. 

 I had never been the center of attention before. It put me on my heels, but I was intelligent enough to use what I had gathered watching people to fit in. I learned more in the first few weeks of school that year than I had in the previous five years of people-watching, and definitely more than I ever learned in any class or book. 

 I quickly learned what a blessing my breasts were; sorry, my 'tits.' I learned what leering boys liked to call them; tits, boobs, mammaries, melons, hooters, and other assorted, low brow, colloquialisms. I learned that boys would fall over themselves because of them, eager to please me for something as little as a clear view down my blouse. I learned how useful they were in intimidating other girls; that there was a natural hierarchy attached to my physical development. I learned that my 'tits', and my new curves and perceived physical attractiveness in general gave me new power over others. 

 At first I did not know what to do with this newfound power. To most girls, sprouting tits was a means to 'getting laid.' To me, they were a tool. A tool to learn more about these people around me; how to provoke them and control them. Eventually, I learned how to wield them like a master. My wardrobe evolved from full-coverage shirts to tight, low cut, blouses. I learned how to flaunt my tits; how to garner attention. And the boys certainly noticed. And not just the boys, the men as well; namely the male teachers. It was funny how teachers who had graded me so tough before suddenly treated me so much better; not that I needed the help. My grades were impeccable, which frustrated and intimidated my teachers. I was smarter than them and did not recognize them as authority figures, and before I became attractive to them, they would seek to put me 'in my place.' Now they sought to gain my favor. 

 The puppets danced. 

 For awhile, I did not care about getting laid. I just did not understand why people did it. I knew you were supposed to only make love with those you have a perceived emotional attachment too, or 'love' as you would call it, and for a person like me, it is impossible to truly 'love' anyone but myself. I had trouble understanding people, let alone loving them. 

 I did not care about any of the boys who were titillated by my impressive figure. What I did care about was the fact that they reacted to me. Before, people treated me just like any other person. But once I developed tits, people were eager to be around me. Seeing people react to my body, or my looks, was thrilling in a way I could not describe. Inspiring reactions in other people was an addiction to me. I had never understood emotions, so making people react emotionally allowed me to experience them vicariously through them. 

 The puppets danced for my amusement. 

 This was my addiction. Making people feel something, making people react to my presence. I did not understand emotions, so provoking an emotional response in others was exhilarating. This addiction thrilled me in a way I did not understand for awhile, until I realized what it was doing. It was arousing me. It turned me on in a way I could barely understand. I chased this feeling for a long time. 

 I mastered flirting. Just testing out how far I could push boys, how wild I could drive them with naughty words or secret glimpses of my body. It was addicting! But it was not just the boys that were affected. The girls noticed as well. While the boys fell over themselves due to my hot bod, the girls hung in the background, fuming in jealousy. 

 Girls hated me. 

 Girls hated my body. Girls hated that I drove the boys wild. And this just engaged me. On one occasion, I flirted with a girl's boyfriend right in front of her. She was visibly furious, beet red and raging, but powerless; a frustrated and impotent ball of conflicting emotions! I knew I had the boy wrapped around my finger, that I could have left with him, but I left it at that. 

 I had to leave, and get some privacy immediately. I was so horny I could scream. I rubbed myself to my first orgasm in the bathroom. A nice, wet, screaming, squirting orgasm. That orgasm was the greatest thing I ever felt. I did not know I could feel things like that. I openly admit that I am emotionless, but an orgasm like that was about as strong of an emotion as you can get. I now understood why people had sex. I saw the appeal. 

 Let us just say, it did not take long for me to lose my virginity after that point. I had so many boys wrapped around my finger that I had my pick of the litter. I was a very busy girl that year. 

 I gladly received the best of what the male student body had to offer. Seeing all these guys driven nuts by little ole me was incredible. Admittedly, most of the guys I screwed were pretty forgettable. I kept pushing the limits as far as sex went. I was getting bored with the male student body, so it was inevitable that I would move on to the faculty. That was where the good stuff was. 

 Driving my teachers to distraction, teasing them with my hot body, teasing them till they had no choice but to fuck me, that was the good stuff. What made it sweeter was when they were married. Married men, driven to cheating on their loves with a slutty student, just drove me wild in a way I never had felt. Let us be clear, I did not care about any of the men I fucked. What drove me wild was the emotion I inspired. What turned me on was, by a few minor actions on my part, causing so much conflict and emotion in men. I loved the fact that I impacted their lives so significantly in such a short amount of time. I loved the fact that they so lusted for me that they would throw away their vows of marriage, and that I could not care less. 

 All the guys in the school wanted me, but the girls, the girls were a different story altogether. The girls hated me. They despised me. They seethed in jealously. They called me a slut. A skank. A whore. But they were powerless before me. They talked behind my back, but none of them said a word to my face. If one was brave enough to confront me, I would stand to my full height, and thrust my imposing chest out, and they would meekly retreat, intimidated and cowed, knowing that they did not compare. 

 I loved it. 

 The more the girls hated me, the more it turned me on. 

 I had left a wide swath of destruction in my wake by the time I graduated high school. I had affected so many lives, a mostly negative impact, by my own actions. Those people in that school would not be the same, because of me. That kind of power was... intoxicating. 

 I had originally decided to forgo college. I knew all that I needed to know. I was able to blend into society seamlessly, few suspecting my true nature. My ticket to affecting people was my hot body, so I became obsessed with maintaining it. I became a gym rat, and this eventually led me to pursue a career as a physical trainer; three years of College was a breeze. 

 My body was amazing, and I was just as effective at affecting people as I had been in high school. This is when the narcissism came in. I recognized how hot I was. I recognized how amazing my body was. It pleased me that I was hotter than just about every woman I came across. I was perfect. 

 My addiction to sex; no, rougher, dirtier...my addiction to fucking had not lessened. I loved to fuck like any good slut would. I would tease just about any man I would come across, but access to my tight little pussy was saved for the best. I no longer fucked just anyone. I never fucked bad boys. They were far too easy. No, my pussy was saved for the good guys. The guys who should know better than to fuck a slut like me. Ideally, a married guy. 

 Like I said, I disliked most people, and this Shannon woman was no different. She was a fat, sad little cow. 

 This was my usual clientele. I hated dealing with these people, and I only kept this job to make money, maintain my lifestyle, and meet men. I had gotten a fair amount of money from my many fuck-buddies, so I maintained a comfortable lifestyle, but not comfortable enough. 

 I wanted more. 

 Every time I looked at Shannon, I considered my ideal fantasy. I dreamed an occasion where I could meet some woman and just break her down; just ruin her life. So many of the women I dealt with were so comfortable with their place in life. The women I dealt with were rarely obese, just simply overweight. They did not need to see me, but they wanted to shave off a few pounds if they had the dedication and willpower. I was just simply a tool to them, a person who would allow them to achieve something, and who would play a small role in an otherwise happy and satisfying life. 

 But I was the puppeteer, not the puppet. 

 Just the thought of taking over that person's life, for no good reason, breaking her down, humiliating her, and maybe, just maybe, fucking her man. That was the dream. The thought of me, ruining the life of a woman I barely know, emotionally destroying her, was intoxicating. 

 Shannon had potential to fulfill my fantasy. She was friendly and seemingly happy with her life. But, I had not met her man. I had had candidates in the past, but their men left a lot to be desired. I could be patient. I would just treat her like shit and make her hate me, you know, my normal modus operandi. Amusingly enough, a lot of women responded to that form of motivation. I loved to make fun of other women, and my insults motivated them to lose weight. I have observed that less attractive women, such as Shannon, seek the validation of the more attractive women. They want to be acknowledged and feel included. Validation is the carrot I use to encourage obedience; one compliment for every fifty insults. My approval is the carrot I dangle before these sad sacks of crap. Shannon is no different, though she will have to work harder than most to get it. 

 Meanwhile, I waited patiently for her husband to join us. I would not get my hopes up. I needed to meet Shannon's husband before I finalized any future plans. 

 ********** 

 (Ben) 

 I had heard horror stories from Shannon said about her trainer, and I figured it was time to meet her myself. I figured this woman probably wasn't as bad as Shannon made her out to be. She tended to over dramatize things like this. 

 I didn't really need any extra training myself. I kept myself in shape, a habit that stemmed from back in my football days. The main reason I played football was because of the exercise, and I stuck with it because it was good stress relief, I guess. 

 I never quite fit in with the other guys on the team. They were in it for different reasons than I was; unrealistic pipe dreams of making it and going pro. That was why when I got hurt, I viewed as a blessing in disguise. I was a good football player... a very good football player. I had no logical reason to stop playing football, since I was told repeatedly that I was being scouted as a favorite to graduate to the pro's. The money was there, but I didn't have the love for the game that other guys had; I just didn't have any passion for football. It wasn't important to me. I had fun playing it, but I never intended to pursue it as a career; but there was all this expectation being put on me, and my old man had big hopes for me, so I just went along with things while looking for a way out...then, thankfully, fate intervened in the form of a bad hit. I tore a ligament in my knee and ended up in the hospital. Dream over, and no one except me was hurt. 

 It was when I was rehabbing my knee that I met Shannon. She was so unlike the girls I typically met as the star QB of the football team. The girls I tended to meet could best be described shallow, phony, and to be honest, a bit trashy. Shannon was none of those things. 

 Shannon was, in a word, genuine. Everything she said and did seemed like it came from the heart. Everything she did was for the right reasons. As I got to know her, I felt no shame telling her things and letting her in. I told Shannon things that I would be too embarrassed to tell anyone else. Shannon is the only person alive that knows the truth about why I let go of my 'promising future' in football; no one else. She didn't judge me, she didn't pity me, she didn't try to change my mind. She just listened. It was then that when I realized that I loved this girl. It wasn't long before we were married. 

 I couldn't have been happier in life. I had a beautiful wife, a nice house, and a great job...a wholly satisfying job; I loved to teach. I was in good shape. I had great friends. I couldn't ask for anything else. 

 Shannon's mind worked a bit differently than mine. She was the type of person who would never be complacent. I knew she had some body-image issues, and I tried to calm her down whenever she nitpicked about her body. I didn't care that that she had some extra padding. It wouldn't matter if she was 400 lbs, I would still love her. I thought she looked perfect as is. I didn't need a woman to be a fitness model. I loved how she looked, and I loved making love with her. But she would not be happy unless she shed some weight. 

 I would of course be there to encourage her...all the way! She knew it didn't matter to me, but I knew it mattered to her, and I wanted to be supportive. I was happy to see her so focused on this. I told her that I would be there to help her out, but she convinced me that I didn't have to show up regularly. I did at least want to make an appearance and check out this trainer for myself; see if she lived up to Shannon's hype, and straighten her out if necessary. 

 I drove straight to the gym from work. I didn't subscribe to any kind of gym, opting to use the weight room at the school instead; one of the perks of the job. I generally woke up early for a morning run, then worked out in the weight room before class started. I would do this regularly, three times a week, with weekends off, and it had kept me in great shape. It had been awhile since I had actually been to a real gym, and I was a little excited about the prospect of really pushing myself again. I quickly changed in the locker room and went searching for my wife. 

 I made my way through the gym. I was greeted by some friendly female faces, and I just nodded politely as I walked; I was used to it. Women regularly hit on me when I was at the gym, for some reason. I always politely declined, of course, but couldn't help but be a bit flattered...it just felt good to be hit on, you know? I walked around for a few minutes before I found Shannon, in a private work out area. 

 I watched quietly through the observation window as Shannon exerted herself on the chest fly. I noticed her face screwed up with effort, and I smiled proudly; she just looked so cute. I just watched for a minute as she strained against the machine, working hard. I could see a woman with her back to me, next to Shannon, talking to her. This must be her trainer. This must be Alexis. 

 The entrance into the room they were in was around the corner, so I had to walk around. I entered the room with Shannon facing away from me. As I stepped inside, the trainer appeared to stop talking and turned to face me. 

 For the first time, I put a face to the name. And I had to admit, she had a face that was hard to forget; she was stunningly beautiful. She had a gorgeous face, with almond shaped eyes, soft lips, and a golden tan. She had dark brunette hair, tied in a pony-tail, which swung animatedly behind her as she turned. She looked me over, as if appraising me, before stepping away from Shannon and walking towards me; her eyes were a steely grey, and betrayed a calculating intelligence at work behind them. I couldn't help but take a quick glance at her body as she approached. Her body belied her profession, as she was incredibly fit. Her legs looked long and tautly muscled. And her arms were muscular without being masculine. She had a flat belly, with just a hint of abs. I generally wasn't the type of guy to linger, but I couldn't help but take notice of her incredibly large bust. They were, like, abnormally large for a woman with such an otherwise fit frame. Despite the fact she was wearing a sports bra, her bulging breasts still jiggled as she walked, and an immodest amount of cleavage was left exposed. I never considered myself a 'breast man', but even I had to admit those suckers she was strutting around with were spectacular. As she stepped up to me, her face lit up with a bright smile...a dazzling smile, to tell the truth. 

 "Can I help you?" she inquired cheerfully; her voice sweet and melodious. 

 "Hi, I'm Ben, Shannon's husband. I thought I could accompany her today." I answered with a smile, offering my hand. 

 "Oh, I've heard so much about you. I'm Alexis," she introduced herself, taking hold of my hand with an impressively firm grip, "But you can call me Lexy...all my friends do." she winked. 

 "Ah...well, I'll call you Alexis for now, till we get to know each other a bit better," I coughed awkwardly, thinking calling her a nickname immediately upon meeting her seemed a bit too forward and unprofessional...intimate. She smiled warmly and stifled a good humored laugh at my expense. 

 "Now, Shannon mentioned that you would be charging double for when I attend. I'm assuming that's still the case?" I asked. Alexis reached over and put her hand on my arm with an awkward amount of familiarity for someone I'd just met. 

 "Of course not. She must have misunderstood me. There won't be any extra charge," Alexis said with a giggle, "You're just supporting your wife...the only extra cost is your gym membership. Didn't she tell you?" Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© "Oh-uh...sorry. That's great," I blinked, slightly embarrassed; had Shannon gotten it mixed up? I felt like an ass. 

 "Now, I can't help but notice that you seem pretty good shape already," she complimented me, her soft hand lingering on my arm, tracing down my bicep and giving it a firm squeeze, testing it's hardness. I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable; the impression Shannon had given me was that she was a cold fish, but she seemed more like a playful puppy dog. I had come in ready to raise heck, but her casual flirtiness was throwing me off my game. 

 "Well, I'm mainly here for moral support," I laughed, and moved back slightly, her hand releasing its grip and falling away as she joined me. 

 "Well, hopefully, I can still give you a good workout," Alexis said with a playful wink, "Do try to keep up." 

 "Uh, yeah," I replied with another awkward laugh, and looked toward Shannon. 

 "Well, I guess I won't hold you up from your sweetie," Alexis said...there was a strange flatness to her tone when she said this that hadn't been there in the rest of our conversation. 

 Alexis turned and led me over to Shannon, who was still exerting herself. I couldn't help but notice Alexis' bouncing butt as she walked. The shorts she was wearing were practically painted on. I had to admit exercise had done wonders for her because she had a spectacular bubble butt. 

 We reached Shannon, and the machine pulled her arms back as she noticed me. 

 "Hey, baby," Shannon greeted me with a bright smile, but her voice cracked slightly, betraying her weariness. She wiped her brow with a towel and gave me a quick peck. She was soaked with sweat, the back of her shirt was soaked through as I hugged her and kissed her forehead. 

 "How's it going?" I asked. 

 "Oh, it's going well. You know, I'm feeling the burn," she said with a strained laugh. 

 "Alright guys, we have to keep this going while her blood is pumping," Alexis interrupted, "Don't want that heart rate to drop and have to start all over." 

 "Okay, well, what's next?" I asked. 

 "Well, I was thinking we could move on to a nice jog, keep your heart rate up and build some much needed stamina." Alexis suggested. 

 "Uh, yeah, sounds good," I nodded in agreement. We followed Alexis upstairs to the elevated track that surrounded the parameter of the gym. Within minutes, we were on the track, jogging at a brisk pace. 

 My favorite method of exercise, by far, was running. I loved to run. I was able to be alone with my thoughts. I never thought more clearly than when I was running. My best ideas always came to me when I was running. I made the decision to propose to Shannon while running. I had to admit, I was a pretty good runner; I had stamina and endurance. I could run for over an hour without breaking a sweat. I'd even participated in some marathons and placed pretty good for a hobby runner. Shannon wasn't at that point yet, so I hung back to run alongside her. I could tell Alexis was slowing down her pace as well, staying a few feet in front of us. 

 "You...don't have to slow down, Ben," Shannon exhaled, sucking in another mouthful of air. 

 "What are you talking about?" I questioned, keeping pace with my wife. 

 "Oh...c'mon, you're a...runner. You can go...faster than this," Shannon rasped, struggling to keep her breath while talking. 

 "I'm fine," I responded. Truthfully, I was hardly testing myself, but I didn't want to discourage her; I was here to support her after all. 

 "Ben, I...don't like to talk when I'm running. If you're...hanging back for a great...conversation, you'll be...disappointed," she tried to laugh, but it came out as a cough instead. 

 "Like I said, I'm fine," I reassured her. 

 "Ben...you're distracting...me. I can't...focus on this and be next to...you at the same time," Shannon wheezed openly now, her face red from the effort of talking, running, and breathing. 

 "Why, do I smell bad?" I joked. She laughed in a sort of sickly sputter. 

 "No...It's just, you...drive me so incredibly...wild being so close," she quipped sarcastically, "It's...your man...musk." 

 "Ha ha ha...ok fine, I get the picture," I leaned down, kissed her cheek, and picked up the pace. I was soon running at my normal pace, which matched the speed that Alexis was running at. We ran side-by-side without a word for about half a lap before she began to talk. 

 "You're a runner, aren't you?" Alexis stated rather than inquired. I looked over at her. Like myself, she had only a light sheen of sweat. She smiled at me as I glanced at her. 

 "Yeah, actually. I run every day," I answered. 

 "Where at?" she probed gently. 

 "Well, I run through the park, through the neighborhood near my house." I told her. "I wake up at five and go running before I have to get ready for work, just before the sun breaks. Helps get me going." 

 "Oh my God, I do the same thing! When I tell people I do that, and they look at me like I'm crazy. It's nice to meet someone who is as dedicated to running as much as I do," Alexis said, effortlessly maintaining her focus as she ran, adding, "We should be running buddies." 

 "Oh, I don't know if that's a good idea," I laughed uncomfortably; was she coming onto me or something? What was with this familiarity? "You're a trainer. I probably can't keep up with you." 

 "I don't know, you're in pretty damn good shape yourself. I am pretty good at being able to tell when someone can keep up with me, and I think you have the potential," Alexis complimented me. 

 "Well, I'll think about it," I told her, non-committal. We slowed up to a stop as we finished the distance Alexis wanted us to run, and we waited patiently for Shannon to finish. 

 "So, Shannon is doing well?" I questioned, curious of Alexis' assessment. 

 "Well, sometimes, it takes awhile to break some people's bad habits. She is still getting there, and if she is dedicated enough, the pounds should start melting off...but she can't seem to realize that this isn't just about losing weight," Alexis explained, holding my gaze with those serious grey eyes, "It's about creating a foundation of good health; stamina, endurance, and diet so that the weight stays off. She's desperate to lose weight and I think she's frustrated that it's not happening yet," I nodded as Shannon approached; Alexis seemed to know her stuff, and was fair in her assessment. 

 "Well, I think we can call it a day. Shannon, I'll see you here tomorrow. Ben, let me know when you are planning to show up. I can individually cater a good workout for the both of you," Alexis said, clapping her hands together with authority. 

 "Okay, that sounds great," I replied. Shannon coughed and gave her a red-faced scowl. 

 "Great. I'll see you guys soon," Alexis waved casually, walking away, her hips swaying with a confident swagger. I put my arm around Shannon's shoulders as we walked the opposite direction. 

 "Well, she seems nice," I told her, giving her should a reassuring squeeze. She looked into my eyes pleadingly. 

 "Please tell me you don't buy that bullshit. Today was the only time I've ever seen her smile, let alone be friendly, and she only started doing that once you showed up!" Shannon spat exasperated, face beet red and hair a tangled, sweaty mess. 

 "Of course not, sweetie," I told her, pulling her in for another kiss. At this revelation, she smiled. Like I said, I liked genuine people, and I could easily tell that Alexis was not being genuine with me. I was a teacher, and I could tell when people would turn on the charm when they wanted something. Alexis was totally giving me that vibe. As if she didn't think Shannon didn't tell me what she put her through. I could see right through Alexis. Besides, it wasn't like I thought my wife was crazy. I knew she wasn't making up stories. 

 "I'll tell you what, if having me around makes her treat you better, I'll try to be here more often, if that's okay with you," I offered. She smiled and nodded. 

 "That might be for the best," Shannon said, "I want to lose the weight fast, but I don't know how much more of her I can take. Maybe having you around will make her nicer."

 (Alexis) 

 Holy Fuck! I did not expect that fat, saggy bitch to have a husband like that. To be perfectly frank, he was the hottest guy I had ever seen. He pushed all my buttons. He was hot. He was buff. And he seemed so innocent and sweet. My pussy moistened and my nipples tightened at the sight of him. I suppose you could say I was smitten with him; at least, in as much as I felt an immediate, overwhelming, physical attraction to him. I was smitten... and confused. How could Shannon be attached to a man like that? It made no logical sense to me...they were obviously so incompatible as mates. What could a perfect physical specimen like him possibly see in a waste of genetic material like her? 

 The more I thought about it, the more I felt what could be akin to anger. The thought of them together deeply offended me...it went against the nature of the world, against millions of years of evolution; it was a shameful waste! How dare she trick him into saddling himself with a fat mess of a girl like her? Unfamiliar sensations overwhelmed my usual cool and collected demeanor. I felt my body tense and my jaw clench, as an unfamiliar heat emanated from my chest and caused my face to flush; was this hate? Before Ben had walked into the picture, I had felt my usual indifference towards Shannon; she was just another pitiful specimen wasting my time with her delusions of becoming attractive by losing a few pounds; but now I felt something. 

 I hated her. 

 Initially, I was caught off guard by Ben, and I could tell that he saw through me when I turned on the charm. It did not matter; if he saw me as being superficial, it would cause him to lower his guard, make him complacent. The more secure he was in his belief that he was in control, the easier it would be to manipulate him. He would fall, just like every other man. I have found that men will fuck just about anything. If a hottie like me throws herself at you, their attitude does not matter. All that matters is if they are hot. I was an evil bitch, and I would freely, even proudly, admit that. But I had no problem getting laid. None at all. 

 I have often heard the quote that men can be more openly evil, more physically evil, while women are more emotionally evil. I completely agree with this hypothesis. Men fight each other. Men start wars. But women...they can tear apart a person's soul. Women have the power to bring others down to their knees, man or woman. And I intended to do that with this supposedly happy couple. I would reveal Shannon to be the miserable, whimpering, sad sack of shit I knew her to be. I would put Shannon on her knees, crying, while I put her man on his knees, eating my sweet pussy. 

 I could feel it in my bones. This was it; this was it...my ultimate fantasy. I had dreamed of completely emotionally eviscerating a woman, and Shannon fit the bill. She barely knew me, yet I would have a deeper impact on her life than anyone. I knew I could do it. I knew I could destroy her...completely. 

 All men loved beautiful women. All of them. Some would act more 'progressive' and date ugly girls, saying it was their 'great personality' that mattered most, but in the end, they would stick with a hottie if they could, no matter what her personality was. 

 Some men liked to act like looks did not matter. And Ben was a prime example of that. He had tricked himself into not being with a woman on his level, but I would teach him the error of his ways. I would teach him what really matters in a woman. I would teach him what a mistake it was to marry a fraud of a woman like Shannon; a sad, stupid, fatty with no tits. I would show him he needs a fit woman like me in his life. 

 I knew I would have to maintain this act for awhile. I would maintain this façade I had created. If I did not, he would defend his wife and get her away from me. I would play the friendly, flirty, superficial girl to him, while still being an evil bitch to her. It did not matter if he saw through it...that would make him confident that he could handle me; complacent in his own seduction, so self assured that he was smarter than me and had seen through my disguise. All that really mattered was that he would get more glimpses of my hot body. As I had learned, the fact that I had big tits would allow me to get away with a lot of things most women could not. Even if Ben did not explicitly know it, he would want to think the best of me. I had big tits. I was beautiful; I could not be evil. 

 I would be friendly long enough to get close to him, all the while showing off my hot body to him. Once I worked my way in close, I would start to let my true self emerge. And he would respond. I know he would. Good guys like him love bad girls. It just takes some time for them to realize it. Once I let my true self emerge, I had no doubt he would be desperate to get in my pants. 

 I could tell that Ben liked to think that it did not matter what weight Shannon was, he would still love her; he wanted to believe that he was a good man, incapable of judging others based solely on their physical appearance. I did not quite believe it. I would say if she were to gain about ten or so pounds, max, Ben would begin to find her unattractive, and his eye would begin to wander. I planned to test that theory. 

 I had a little ace up my sleeve. I only brought it out for special occasions. A bottle of pills. I would tell Shannon they were proven diet pills, but they were not. They were, in fact, weight-gain pills, designed to build mass in pro- athletes. Not so good for a woman trying to lose weight. She would be baffled as, despite her diet and exercising, she would put more and more weight, her gut expanding, her rolls of disgusting flab becoming more pronounced, her already huge ass fatter...a living nightmare; a prisoner in her own body. And with the abuse I was about to lump on her, very soon, she would not need those pills to pack on the pounds; she would be doing that to herself, a slave to her own lack of self control, placating her low self-esteem with comfort food; I could just tell she was a stress eater. And despite her husband's promise to the contrary, he would not be satisfied with a flabby blob for a wife. 

 Shannon had come to me to lose a few pounds, but she was going to lose a lot more than that. 

 ********** 

 (Shannon) 

 "Move your ass you fucking tub of lard!" Alexis barked as I ran on the treadmill. The speed was a little higher than I was used to, and I was having a little trouble getting caught up. Ever since Ben had shown up for that session a few days ago, Alexis' abuse had escalated. Ben was nearing the end of the school year, so he had gotten extremely busy, and had been unable to get back to the gym with me since that first session. 

 I don't know why I was putting myself through this abuse, I really don't. Everyone I knew said she was tough, that she was a bitch, but she was good; but this was a fucking nightmare! I just hoped that this was all part of her plan. That maybe there was a method to her madness. That maybe she actually did like and respect me, and she was putting me through this boot camp in order to motivate me. That had to be it. They wouldn't let her work with people if she was as rotten to the core as she seemed to be. Maybe at the end of all this, when I slimmed down, she would shake my hand and say good job. That had to be the case, because I wouldn't have to put up with the nasty things she spouted otherwise. 

 Her words had taken a darker turn since she had met my husband. Before, her words had mainly been just deprecating to me, calling me sad, fat, and pathetic. But since she met Ben, she had gone a different direction. Sure, she still called me fat, sad, and pathetic, but she added to her repertoire of insults. 

 When I was jogging, Alexis would openly muse, "God, it is a wonder you landed a man with all that nasty fat, lardo!" 

 When I was on the Stairmaster, Alexis would taunt, "Do you think that husband of yours will hang around a girl who cannot go up a few stairs without huffing and puffing, Stay-Puft?" 

 When I was on the exercise bike, Alexis would spit, "You already wearing out? If you do not push yourself, that man of yours is not sticking around! Who would want to hang around a downright obese piece of shit like you, you...fatty...fat...FAT!?" 

 When I told her Ben wasn't showing up because he had work to take care of, "Work? Yeah, right. He is not staying late at work. He is not missing all of these sessions because of work. I bet he is shacked up in a hotel somewhere getting some pussy while you're wasting my time here. And if he is not, he should be. He deserves it." 

 That last one pissed me off. It was literally the first thing I told her that session, and she came after me immediately with that. I had to say something. 

 "You, know, I don't have to put up with this. You're crossing the line..." I started. She stepped up to me and got in my face, almost confrontationally. 

 "Well, then prove me wrong, bitch. Make yourself attractive for him so he will not have to stray," she came back at me with. I just gritted my teeth and walked past her. 

 So, yeah, you can see what I was putting up with. Sometimes, I just wanted to hit her. But I told myself to use this as motivation, and it would be that much sweeter when I was trim and better looking than she could dream of. 

 We reached the end of one of our sessions when she met with me to discuss my diet. 

 "Since your current diet does not seem to be working, and you insist you are not cheating on it, then I guess it is time to move on to something new," Alexis said, handing over a piece of paper before continuing, "This diet is more severe than your current one, but that seems to be the only way. Plus, take these," she explained, handing over a bottle of pills, "Take one of these with each meal. These should hopefully help you shed the pounds." 

 I tried this new diet, and I felt like I was barely eating. The food I was eating was bland and tasteless, and the pill seemed to not be having an effect. I almost cried when I looked at the scale and saw that I had put on a pound. I had put so much hard work, had eaten barely anything, and had put up with so much emotional abuse, and for nothing. It wasn't working. I had to wonder if I was wasting my time. Ben didn't care if I had a few extra pounds. But, no, I had to push through this. I just knew that once I got over that hill and started losing weight, the pounds would fall right off. 

 I rededicated myself to working out, and I was strict about my diet. After a week or so, there was still no progress. On one of my days off from training, one of my co-workers took me out for lunch. It was a nice day, and the restaurant we went to had tables outside. I was absolutely starving, and for the first time, I cheated on my diet. I got a nice, juicy burger, and I was practically drooling when the waitress dropped it off. I had just taken my first bite when I heard from over my shoulder, someone mutter, "Fucking figures." 

 I looked up to see Alexis, also on her day off, walk by. I dropped the burger to the plate. 

 "What's up?" my friend asked. 

 "That was my trainer. She's gonna kill me." I said. I sent the burger away. I cheated on my diet, and I couldn't even enjoy it. 

 Just like I thought, as soon as she saw me, Alexis absolutely lit into me during our next session. 

 "You are pretty bold to show your face here, after I caught you cheating on your diet, pound cake? Why should I waste my time? As soon as we are done, you just go out and pig out on cake and burgers. I do not care what you are paying me if you are just going to waste time that I could be spending on someone that actually cares about their body!" Report_Story #5 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© "I took one bite then stopped. It was the first time I ever cheated on the diet, but you probably won't believe me anyway," I said. 

 "You are damn right I do not believe you! It is no wonder you are packing on the pounds after all of this. I don't know why I'm bothering. You are lucky I am a nice and forgiving person," Alexis said. I had to stop myself from laughing at that. 

 I started lifting some weights, nothing too heavy, but enough for me to feel it. But Alexis's sour mood kept her talking. 

 "I do not know why you are trying to build up muscle when you have not lost a single pound of fat yet," she criticized. 

 We moved on the leg press, and as I struggled to lift a large amount of weight, it was if she had reached her breaking point. 

 "You know what, I think you should go home. I do not want to see you anymore today. Do not come back here without your husband. I want you to show him the pathetic effort you have been putting on," Alexis said, storming out, throwing over her shoulder, "Maybe you're too weak to do this on your own...maybe you need to be reminded why you want a hot body like mine in the first place." 

 My eyes started to well up with tears, as the horrible woman I'd paid to help me abandoned me in frustration. 

 Maybe she was right. 

 ********* 

 (Alexis) 

 I practically had to lock myself in my office and rub myself off. These past few weeks had been going great. I had taken a new tact with my insults, insinuating that she was not enough of a woman to hold on to a man like Ben. I was quickly breaking this bitch down, tearing apart her fragile self-image and destroying her already low self-esteem, and it started to show. She was an emotional mess after a few sessions, so it was no surprise that I had found her cheating on her diet and chowing down on a big, fat burger, like a hungry dog with a chunk of raw meat. 

 I was in a great mood the instant I saw this. It excited me to mock her. It thrilled me to point out her inadequacy. It turned me on every time I did. I am surprised she didn't notice my hard nipples, or the growing stain on my tight workout shorts...I'd have to do something about that. But seeing this bitch so broken down that she lost all compulsion to lose weight, seeing the damage I had done, drove me wild. She was an emotional mess, thanks to me. As a trainer, you would think I would be mad that my client was pigging out on fatty foods. But I was not. I was happy. Make yourself tubbier for your man, bitch. Keep chowing down on big, fat burgers, and very soon, I will be chowing down on her husband's big, fat cock. 

 ********* 

 (Shannon) 

 I hadn't told Ben about cheating on my diet. It was a moment of weakness, and I didn't want him to know about it. I didn't want him to...think less of me. I told him that Alexis really wanted him at the session, and he was able to carve out some time to do so. I left a message with Alexis letting her know we were coming the next day. 

 Ben and I drove in together, and I was a bit nervous about seeing Alexis again. I had never seen her as angry as she was the last time I saw her. I had let Ben in on the fact that she was really mad, but he didn't know why. I told him I just assumed it was her general attitude. Either way, I told him it might be a good idea if he could make it as often as possible. Luckily, school was finishing up, so he would have more time to attend. 

 I was cautiously optimistic as we entered the gym. I knew with Ben by my side that Alexis would be on her best behavior. We got changed and met up, walking to the area where I typically worked with Alexis. I spied her in there through the windows, and as we entered, she turned to greet us. 

 The first thing I noticed was her outfit. Typically, she wore clothes that were typical of most female trainers, something slim and tight, which highlighted her body. But this outfit was near obscene. Her tight, purple top was seemed like merely a thin strip of material which covered her breasts and nothing else. The straps of her top cut into her shoulders seemed overworked with the strain of supporting her heavy breasts. She also wore a tight pair of stretchy, black booty shorts, which just barely went below her ass. The only other things she wore were a pair of sneakers and a bright smile. 

 "Hey, guys welcome back," Alexis said. "Ben, so nice to see you back here again." 

 "Good to be back," Ben said, going with the flow, surprised to find her so friendly, as I was. 

 "Well, I think we should start off with some stretching," Alexis suggested. Me and Ben both nodded in agreement, though I was wary of this. 

 For the next few minutes, Alexis led us through a series of stretches. As she did this, she stood in front of Ben. She spoke to him and not to me, as if he was the only one in the room and I was just an insignificant fly on the wall. I didn't care; the less I had to deal with her the better. The only time it was an issue was when she told us to bend over at our waists, leaving our upper- halves perpendicular to our lower halves. This put Ben's face within a foot or so from Alexis' perfect, round, ass. 

 I was frozen to the spot, not knowing what to say. Ben didn't seem to behave any differently, and we moved on to touching our toes before he could. He didn't notice anything when she bent at her waist facing him, exposing that frustratingly deep valley of cleavage to him. He didn't admire her strong, smooth, sexy back when she stretched out in front of him. Finally, she clapped her hands and turned around. 

 "Okay, I thought we could do some lifting today. Follow me," Alexis punctuated her statement with a small, sharp, clap. She led us over to a pair of weight benches. I laid down on one while Ben got into position on the other. Alexis loaded up the weights on each of our bars; putting more weight on mine then she typically did. She loaded up Ben's bar quite a bit as well. 

 "Alexis, I think this is a bit too much," I protested, more than a little reticent about trying to lift the imposing amount of weight. 

 "Oh, c'mon, Shan, why not show off the progress you made in front of your hubby...make him proud!" she chirped, with a sickeningly sweet smile, throwing in, "If you can." 

 It worried me when she smiled; on the surface, her pretty face seemed to light up with delight, but to me she looked like a shark, all cold logic and cruel intent. To me, it looked like she was planning something. She next walked over to Ben's station, while I hesitantly gripped the weight bar. It was as I inhaled and lifted the bar from its perch that I heard Alexis speak. 

 "Okay, Ben, it's time to show me what you're made of," she cooed seductively. I had the bar in my hands, arms stretched straight, balancing the weight precariously above me, I turned my head to look over at Ben. Alexis was now straddling my husband's face, spotting him. I watched as he lifted the bar, his muscles straining with the weight, veins popping impressively. 

 "That's okay, you got it," Alexis encouraged Ben with a honey-like sweetness that I had never heard from her. He lowered the bar with measured control until it was touching his chest. She hovered her hands under it just in case he needed help. As she did this, her crotch lowered until it was within a few inches of his face. This sight caused my arms to quiver as I lost my focus and slowly drop the bar until it was precariously balanced on my chest. 

 "Uh, help!" I croaked weakly, struggling to keep the bar from crushing my rib cage, lacking the leverage or strength to force it back up. But neither of them heard me. Ben was straining to heft the heavy amount of weight he was holding, and Alexis was right there, cooing encouragements at him, coaxing him to exert himself beyond his usual means. She was right there, waiting to see if he needed any help, and once it became clear he didn't need any and he would be able to lift the bar back into place, she took the opportunity to admire his bulging biceps, rubbing them gently with her hands as he the bar back into place. 

 "Very impressive, Ben," Alexis complimented Ben admiringly, her voice dripping with uncharacteristic honey. 

 "Uh, help!" I wheezed again, struggling with the weight I was desperately trying to support, which was now sitting painfully on my upper chest, just above my breasts, my arms shaking as I tried to keep it from crushing my rib cage. Alexis lazily sauntered over and with an arrogant ease, put her hands under my bar and effortlessly lifted it back into place. 

 "I was kinda struggling there, Alexis," I scolded her, angry at being ignored, "I told you it was too much, and you just left me there!" 

 "Sorry, I was in another world. I assumed you could handle it; you're a big girl after all," Alexis replied flatly, her eyes betraying that familiar cold, gray, disinterest. 

 I rolled my eyes. She removed some of the weights on mine, and both me and Ben spent the next few minutes lifting, working up a good sweat. I was more than a little annoyed that Alexis was still focusing more on Ben than me. 

 The rest of the session went relatively painlessly. We did some endurance work on the exercise bike, some yoga, leg presses, and we did some running, with Alexis and Ben both running far ahead of me again, leaving me behind. 

 The next day was a day off from our training, and I was happy to get away from Alexis and this training for a bit. I was happy to see Ben didn't seem receptive to Alexis' obvious come-ons and attempts to flaunt her body before him. He again knew that Alexis' attitude was complete bullshit, but he was willing to go along with it to help me lose weight. He was willing to protect me from her abuse. 

 I had the best husband in the world. 

 *********** 

 (Alexis) 

 God, I wanted Shannon's husband bad. He seemed like such a good guy. He had a gorgeous body. He had a cute smile. He was perfect. 

 Perfect for me. 

 I couldn't wait to corrupt him. I couldn't wait to turn that smile into a sneer as he pounded me. I couldn't wait to turn this good guy into my personal bad boy. 

 I had used my displeasure with Shannon to convince her to bring Ben back to me. Once I knew he was coming, I adjusted my plans. I had an excuse now to wear my sluttiest work out outfit. I paraded my body's best assets before his eyes. My flat belly. My big titties. My long legs. I bounced around like a preppy gym rat around him; but like a good husband, he pretended not to notice. I practically sat on his face under the guise of spotting him, but he acted like nothing was amiss. I would be shocked if he had not smelled my juices as I did so. But since he was so distracted, I was able to easily take a glimpse at the sizable bulge straining his shorts; taunting me. 

 I was thoroughly displeased, though, that by the end of the session that he had not at least given some indication that he had noticed my hot body, that tempting bulge failing to stir despite my best efforts. 

 Then I realized the reason for that. He had to be on his best behavior around 'the wife'. Plus, he was probably hesitant of me because he figured that I was being not quite so genuine; but this only made him more desirable...not just a hunk, but an intelligent, strong willed, and perceptive man. A muscular stud with a big cock is a dime a dozen, but the fact that Ben could see through my charade, that he was going to be a challenge to break and bend to my will, was only further proof that we were perfectly compatible mates. But I would have to get him alone. 

 I needed to get him away from his wife. That way, he would not have his wife around clouding his judgment or distracting him from what he should be focusing on...namely, me. She had filled his head with a negative perception of me. Without her being around, he could appreciate me for what I was. And maybe once he got to know me, he would start to doubt his original, biased, judgment. Maybe he would start to think that I was what I presented myself as being. Maybe I was a preppy, harmlessly flirty and fun, personal trainer. And once he thought that, maybe he would start to think his wife was telling stories. Maybe he would start to think his wife was the crazy one. 

 There was nothing quite like thinking your spouse was crazy to drive you into the arms of another woman. 

 ********* 

 (Ben) 

 The sun was beginning to slowly break over the horizon as I enjoyed my morning run. My thoughts drifted to Shannon and her issues with Alexis. I had told her that she didn't have to put herself through this. I didn't care if she lost weight. And Alexis' abuse had started to affect Shannon outside of their sessions in the gym. Shannon was not as happy and care-free as she used to before this whole thing had started. 

 It infuriated me that Alexis could be that evil and abusive to my wife without repercussions. What infuriated more was that she turned it off when I was around. She chose to yell at and humiliate my wife, but I had no solid proof of her abuse; no evidence to support Shannon's claims and complain to the gym's management, and Shannon refused to lodge a complaint of her own, choosing instead to absorb her abuse in the hopes that it would pay off. I wish I could see her at it, simply so I could fight back at her and defend my wife, but she had been nothing but friendly to me. There was no question to me that my wife was telling the truth. My wife was too stubborn to just quit, so I had to be a good husband and go along with this charade...for her sake. 

 I was so engrossed in my own turbulent thoughts that I didn't notice the familiar voice calling out to me. It was as I turned a corner in the park that I practically ran into her. I staggered back as I realized Alexis was right in front of me. 

 "Whoa, Ben. Sorry, didn't mean to startle you," she said apologetically, smiling warmly. 

 "Oh no, sorry, it was my fault; I was in a zone there," I replied, wary of her. What was she doing here? 

 "I know how that goes," she chirped brightly, flashing those perfect white teeth charmingly, "So, how's your run going?" 

 "Not too bad. Same old, same old." I replied awkwardly, "Yours?" I asked back, making awkward small talk, still trying to find my balance in this conversation. It felt almost surreal to see her outside the gym; it seemed like her natural habitat, so clean and clinical; a place for building perfect people. Out here in nature, it only seemed to call attention to her almost unnatural beauty, particularly in the warm morning light. 

 "As good as always," she answered in that honey sweet voice of hers. There was a lull in our conversation, as we stared at each other, until she broke it, "So, I have to ask, how much of what goes on in our sessions does Shannon tell you?" 

 "Um, well, I..." I started. I didn't trust her, but I'm too honest a guy to outright lie to someone. 

 "Don't worry, you can be honest. I can take it," she said with a sly smile. 

 "Well, she says you are pretty tough on her," I said, studying her reaction. I didn't want to make things worse on Shannon, but this might have been my chance to expose Alexis. 

 "Is that all?" she laughed dismissively, "Like I said, you can be totally honest with me. It won't change anything," 

 I paused and considered this, and thought, 'What the hell? May was well go for broke.' 

 "Honestly, she says you're a complete bitch. She says you're a drill instructor to her...or worse," I accused, bluntly as I could. Her reaction was to smile and laughed. 

 "I can be pretty demanding, I'm big enough to admit that. But do you want to know why?" she asked, still giggling softly. 

 "Uh, sure." I replied, caught off guard by her flippant reaction to my accusation. 

 "I'm tough on the people that need it. I'm not tough on you, because clearly, you don't need any 'tough love' to motivate you. If I could speak candidly with you, your wife is the type of person that is self-sabotaging. She will say one thing and do another; for example, 'I want to lose weight', but then she doesn't follow her diet. You want to know why I was pissed at her a couple days ago? I caught her cheating on her diet. She was scarfing down on a big, fat burger. She needs someone to kick her ass into shape. If I show too much compassion or sympathy, she will take advantage of it, and play towards my good nature whenever things get tough to her. Someone has to treat her this way, because if not, she will end up weighing 400 pounds." Alexis said. 

 "I don't think that's true at all. She's only a few pounds overweight. She's not a compulsive eater or anything like that," I countered defensively, a little angry that she'd accuse Shannon of loafing and cheating on her diet, when I knew the kind of abuse she was absorbing from Alexis. I knew my wife...didn't I? 

 "You saw how tough my workouts are, and you know what? She's actually gained weight!" Alexis argued, her voice softening, looking for sympathy. 

 "Doesn't that just prove that what you are doing isn't working?" I accused, feeling a little ashamed when I saw a pained twinge as her pouty lips fell in a disappointed frown. I may have actually hurt her feelings. 

 "Fair enough. I have been doing this for years, and my methods have always been proven correct. The harder I ride people, the more they respond. The more weight they lose, the healthier they feel, and the closer they get to achieving their ideal body image. All those girls thank me afterward for riding them. I am starting to think that maybe there is no helping her. If she doesn't have the dedication to lose weight and stay fit, there is nothing I can do," Alexis said. 

 "She has the dedication. Maybe if she had some positive reinforcement, she could do better," I replied, "Just encourage her; I know it'll make a difference...please." 

 "Okay. I am agreeable. I tell you what. I will be nice to your wife. I will be positive, and let's just see how that goes. If it works, and she starts to lose weight, I'll give you a full refund, and an apology," Alexis offered. I was happily surprised by this offer. 

 "And if it doesn't?" I asked, warily, unsure of what other edge of this sword was going to be. 

 "If I am right, all I want is for you to be my running buddy," she said with a playful giggle, that irresistible smile coming back. 

 "What?" I blinked, stunned. 

 "You see, I'm not that bad. All I want is a running buddy. What's so bad about that?" she mused. There was something sly about the way she said this, playful but...with some hidden intent. I tried to think of what the worst that could happen was, but decided that I had faith in Shannon, even though I didn't fully trust Alexis. 

 "Okay...sure," I reluctantly agreed. 

 "Great!" Alexis grabbed my hand in both of hers, her soft skin clutching mine warmly, shaking it to seal the agreement, "I can't wait!" 

 I was a little put off by her confidence that Shannon would fail, especially considering that she stood to lose not only her dignity, but a substantial amount of cash. What was she up to? What was she trying to pull here? There was no way Shannon was going to put on weight...it was impossible! What was Alexis' game? 

 "So, which one is the real you? This, or the one you show my wife?" I asked bluntly, looking for a straight answer. 

 "You'll have to find out." she teased. Another awkward silence surrounded us. 

 "Well, I'd better get going." I said. 

 "Okay, I'll see you tomorrow," Alexis started, "By the way, bring your swimsuit." 

 "Oh, I can't make it tomorrow; I have to finalize my curriculum for next year. But after that, I should be there for the rest of them," I said, feeling a little more comfortable conversing with Alexis, despite myself. Maybe she was growing on me after all? 

 "Oh, well, then we'll push back swimming till then. I'll test out your theory tomorrow then," Alexis replied, betraying a little disappointment. 

 "Okay, sounds good," I called over my shoulder, running toward home. Report_Story #6 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© ********* 

 (Shannon) 

 I was feeling pretty down the next morning. When I was in the bathroom getting ready in the morning, I weighed myself and was horrified to discover I was three pounds heavier than I was when I started seeing Alexis. I stared at the digital readout, unbelieving...how could this be? All that sweat, all that pain, both physical and emotion, and not only was it for nothing, I was actually getting further from my goal. Ben walked into the bathroom to shave, as he usually did while I finished up, and saw me on the scale. I quickly stepped off as he approached, not wanting him to see my shame, and faked a smile, "L-lost two pounds! Just 13 more to go..." I lied, cutting him off before he could ask. Ben hugged me reassuringly and told me I would get there, and how proud he was. 

 I felt sick as he kissed me on my forehead. I had never lied to Ben before, but I couldn't let him know I'd put on weight. Not when he had Alexis to compare me too. The fact that he was proud of me was the worst part though, because the reality was that I was failing him. I had to work harder...I had to succeed now; I had no other choice. 

 As sick as it was, Alexis was now my only hope. 

 But I dreaded going in to meet with Alexis; I dreaded going in without Ben by my side, to keep her on her best behavior and distract her from torturing me, particularly knowing that I'd be up there on that damned scale again, subject to her judgments and harsh criticisms. But, strangely enough, when I hot there, Alexis was uncharacteristically pleasant. 

 I don't know what got in to her, but she was friendlier than I had ever seen her. It was easily the most pleasant experience I had ever had with her. She was pleasant and encouraging and downright positive to me. I felt like if the rest of the training went this well, I could handle this easily. 

 ********** 

 (Ben) 

 I was happy to hear that Alexis had lived up to her word. Shannon seemed elated that she was getting positive reinforcement, and she seemed excited about the future of her training. So, for the first time, I was looking forward to one of these training sessions. I felt like, maybe, just maybe, I had misjudged Alexis. She had a method that usually worked, and it didn't work for Shannon, and she was willing to adjust her methods. I could now start to feel a modicum respect for her. She was good at her job. She had some unusual methods, but I could see how that would work for some people. But Shannon was unique. Shannon was...not most women. 

 I had changed into my swim trunks and was waiting by the pool at the gym. Shannon emerged from the Women's change room in a cute one-piece swimsuit; bright yellow with a large sunflower print on the left side. She was self- conscious about wearing her bikini in front of other people besides me, especially Alexis, so she opted for her one-piece. It didn't matter to me. She looked cute in whatever she wore. 

 "I hate swimming," Shannon complained with a pout. She had never been too good in the water. 

 "Yeah, I've never been crazy about it either," I comforted her. This was something of a lie, as I actually had no strong feelings against swimming, but I didn't want her to feel alone in this. 

 "Yeah, but you're a good swimmer," Shannon said. 

 "I'm okay. You're not a bad swimmer either," I replied coolly. 

 "Not as good as you," she repeated with a smile. 

 "Okay guys, you ready to swim?" Alexis called out from behind us. Shannon and I turned and looked for her, and I will admit that she would be impossible to overlook. 

 Alexis wasn't wearing a normal athletic swimsuit, one that was practical for swimming laps; no, she was wearing a beach bikini. A bikini not built for practicality, but one built to show off her body. It was a cool grey number that matched her eyes. The bottom was skimpy and clingy, but it covered enough of her as not to violate the laws of decency. The top's purpose was more to cover her (barely) as opposed to providing any support for her large breasts. It consisted of two triangular patches stretched tightly across her breasts, molding to them while still showing them off, as the sides of each breasts were still visible. The patches were tied together by thin strings. The only other thing she wore was a bright smile. 

 "Hey guys, you ready to go?" Alexis asked cheerfully. We were both still too flabbergasted by her outfit to reply immediately, so we just nodded awkwardly in unison, eyes wide and mouths embarrassingly agape. 

 "Okay, I think we can do laps for awhile. That'll get the blood pumping," Alexis suggested, thankfully not calling attention to our shocked and awed reaction to her arrival. 

 Alexis led us into the pool area, and we stood in a line across the edge of it. Alexis was the first to dive, cutting the water with the grace of a natural swimmer. I was shocked to see how good of a swimmer she was; most swimmers are slim and didn't possess the more than generous bust that she had to create resistance, but Alexis glided through the water as if she were born there, pulled along by strong arms and pushed by strong legs. We watched her finish her first lap and as she approached us, she stood in the water and looked up at us. 

 "Come on, guys. Let's go," Alexis cooed invitingly, that sly smile crossing her lips. I couldn't help but glance at her glistening chest. The bikini top molded to her chest, and her breasts quivered hypnotically as she spoke. I shook my head and dove into the water, Shannon followed behind me. 

 I was a pretty good swimmer, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did running. Swimming, quite frankly, kicked my ass. It was an acquired taste, and I never acquired it. But Alexis did, because she swam circles around both me and Shannon. She was so smooth in the water, and her body glided through the water with graceful ease. Shannon was struggling, but I couldn't blame her. As anyone who has swam knows, it is a lot harder than you think. Trying to swim full speed will take everything out of you if you are not good at it. So it was no surprise that as we finished up, Shannon rushed to the bathroom to puke. I wasn't feeling much better, but Alexis was feeling fine. She was in excellent shape, and could handle just about anything, it seemed. 

 "I'm disappointed, Ben. I thought you would be better at this," Alexis said. 

 "I've never been much of a swimmer," I told her, still catching my breath. 

 "Well, it's something I can teach you," Alexis offered in that honeyed voice of hers, her full lips spreading in a hungry smile. 

 "Yeah, maybe." I said, standing up straight, "Oh, thanks for taking it easy on her. I appreciate it," I really meant it too; Shannon had been in a much better mood lately, which made my life easier. 

 "Oh, no problem. I'd do anything to satisfy my customers," she said, "We'll find out if your theory was effective in a week or so. If by the end of the week, she has lost some weight, than I will change my ways. If not, then, I guess I'll have been proven right, and have a new running buddy," she winked at me with a playful confidence that unnerved me. I was confident that Shannon could do it, but Alexis seemed even more confident that she couldn't, and this made me worry. 

 "Well, we'll see," I responded coolly, betraying nothing. 

 Our conversation was cut thankfully short as Shannon returned from the bathroom. She still looked pale and sickly to me, her eyes slightly glassy, and her stomach a little bloated. 

 "Feeling better?" I asked, concerned. 

 "A little," Shannon replied weakly, her glassy eyes looking for sympathy. 

 "I know this was tough for you guys, so I figured we could use the sauna for a bit, try to relax and sweat away our problems," Alexis offered. 

 "Sounds good," I answered eagerly. Truth was that I had pushed myself a little too far, and could feel the acid burning in my sore muscles; a steam bath would feel great right about now. Shannon nodded her head weakly, her relief obvious. I put my arm around her shoulders and hugged her close, helping her along on wobbly legs, still weak from the swim, back to the changing area. 

 Within a few minutes, I had slipped out of my trunks and wrapped a towel around myself. I walked to the sauna, and as I reached it, Shannon emerged nearby, with a towel wrapped around herself. We entered the empty sauna together and found some seats as we acclimated to the heat. 

 "So, it seems like Alexis has finally come around," I offered, trying to comfort Shannon, who still looked pretty rough. 

 "I hope so. If she can focus on the exercise as opposed to yelling at me, then this might go better," Shannon sighed as she sank back against the wall, eyes closed as she unwound. I nodded in agreement. 

 I had really appreciated a sauna before, but it felt really good to sit down and relax, and like Alexis said, sweat out our worries. Things were going great, and then the door opened. 

 ********* 

 (Shannon) 

 I agreed with Ben that things were going better. Alexis had shown that she was able to be friendly without Ben being present to keep her in line. I felt like if things could continue this way, I should lose that weight quickly. I felt like, finally, things were starting to go my way. I was ready to relax in the sauna, ready to forget the issues that had plagued me these last few weeks. Then the door opened. 

 I wish I had been able to move on from the mindset I had in my younger days. The mindset I had before I married Ben; but when that door opened, I reverted back to high school Shannon. The gawky, insecure, jealous teenage girl who envied the pretty, popular, girls with the big boobs. 

 We both looked up as the door opened, and in walked Alexis, wearing only a towel, tied around that ridiculous chest of hers. 

 "Hey, guys," she cooed nonchalantly, casually sauntering towards us and taking a seat next to Ben, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. 

 What gave me issue wasn't simply her proximity to Ben, though I did think it bold of her to sit right next to him when the sauna was completely empty. What gave me issue was the way she paraded those big tits of hers around in front of us. What gave me issue was the fact the towel she was wearing was tied so low and tight on her bulbous chest, just above her nipples, so low I could swear I saw a hint of rosy pink areola, crushing her fat tits together to create a cavernous cleavage to display proudly to the both of us, almost daring Ben to stare into that deep, inviting pit in front of me, his wife! 

 Ben had had multiple opportunities previously to admire at Alexis's body, and like a good husband, he had not even turned his head, instead keeping his eyes on me. That's why I loved him, because he didn't care about such shallow things as big boobs and firm butts. He had never been that kind of guy. 

 "Oh, this feels great...don't you feel better now Shannon?" Alexis groaned sensuously, leaning back, thrusting out her ridiculous chest even further, taxing the towel's ability to keep her modest, her flesh creeping over the edge, as she ran her fingers through her silky mane of dark hair. She looked like a walking beer commercial. 

 "Oh, uh, yeah," I croaked, looking back at her. I glanced at my husband, just as I saw him take a glance at Alexis's juicy cleavage. I jerked my eyes straight forward in shock, facing away from both of them. I couldn't believe it. My husband, the man who had never shown interest in any other woman, who had never shown any indication that a girl's cup size mattered to him, had just checked out my personal trainer's massive rack. 

 My husband couldn't be one of those guys, could he? Was it possible that, deep down, my husband secretly wanted a woman with giant breasts? Was my bra size a source of disappointment for him? If he had the choice, would he rather have a woman with a massive set of dense, firm, tits like Alexis'? 

 Maybe I was reading too much into things. He had tried to get us to work things out; to smooth things over between Alexis and me...though he did seem to defend her quite a bit whenever I complained. I had assumed it was because he was playing Devil's Advocate, since he wasn't there to see how horrible she was to me, but now...was he being sympathetic to her simply because of her tremendous rack? Did he gloss over her obvious character defects just because she has a big set of tits? Was Ben secretly that shallow? 

 I steeled myself and turned around, to find her chatting with Ben. He seemed like he was maintaining eye contact, but I couldn't help but glance at the view she was providing, and wonder if his eyes were darting down to steal a glimpse, as his head was turned away from me. 

 Alexis breasts glistened with a thin sheen of sweat, beads of which rolled down the expanse of her chest, down the hilly slopes of her burgeoning breasts, and into that dark, inviting, valley of cleavage. I had to admit it was an appetizing sight for any man, as even I couldn't help but stare openly. Maybe my eyes had played tricks on me. I watched my husband during this conversation, not hearing their words. My husband must have said something funny, because Alexis turned her head and laughed, pushing her hair coyly behind her ear. I watched as my husband took advantage, once again stealing another glance at her big, bulbous breasts as they shuddered with the convulsions of her melodious laughter. 

 I could not believe it. My husband was enamored with Alexis's big breasts, like some horny teenager! Was it just a coincidence that he began to make it here on a regular basis once she started wearing skimpier clothing? Did my husband have a little crush on this horrid bitch? He knew how much of a bitch she was to me, I had told him as much, and he had even agreed with me! But, noooo, because she had big tits, that didn't matter! Since she had big tits, she could do whatever she wanted. She could get by in life being a total bitch, but that's okay as long as she paraded her big boobs around in tight clothes for men like Ben to ogle. That's bullshit! Things never changed. There was an unfair double standard; girls with big boobs could get away with so much more than us regular women. 

 I stewed in anger for the rest of our steam bath. I'm sure they noticed it, but I didn't care; I wanted them to. I wanted Ben to feel ashamed, and Alexis to feel uncomfortable, as she apparently had no shame. 

 I was still pissed at the whole situation when I went into the locker room to take a shower. I was the only one in there, so I just stood there and let the water run over my head as I pondered today's events. I didn't get to think too long, as I heard another shower turn on across the room. I started washing all the sweat off when I happened to glance at the other person in the shower. I normally kept my eyes to myself, and I only meant it as a quick glance, but when I saw who it was, I couldn't help but stare. 

 It was Alexis that stood there in the shower with me, and she was in the buff. I had never even seen her in the locker room before, but there she was, scrubbing herself down, bare ass naked beside me. I could only see her from the side, which didn't allow me to see any of the goods, not that I necessarily wanted to. Then she turned to face me as she scrubbed down her front. 

 And there they were, right there. My personal trainer's giant breasts. Even though I hated her, even though I hated the fact that she had humongous boobs, I couldn't help but admit her tits were stupendous. Fucking works of art. I wish I could say they were saggy, they weren't; they were incredibly firm, unbelievably all-natural, and infuriatingly perky. I wished I could say they were abnormal in some way, but they weren't. There was not a blemish on them, and the nipples were the ideal size. The areola's looked round and smooth, a healthy rosy shade of pink, and there was not a single tan line. Those suckers sat firmly on her chest, jaw-droppingly gigantic and infuriatingly perfect. They were in sharp contrast to her devoid of fat, flat belly, and this led my eyes downward. 

 I couldn't help but glance at her pussy. Like the rest of her, it looked perfect. It looked nice and cute and clean, with a trim line of hair above it. I had to pull my eyes away, and as I looked up, I realized she was looking back at me, with that knowing, self satisfied, grin of hers. 

 Surprisingly, she didn't say a word. She just looked at me as she washed herself. It was like she was putting on a private, dirty, little show for me, as she soaped up her hands, developing a good amount of lather, and ran hand hands over her dense tits, roughly kneading and caressing her fleshy orbs, rolling the firm flesh around her chest, as she held my stare with those cold, grey, passionless eyes of hers. I just stared at her dumbly, mouth slightly agape, as her hands drifted down, lathering up her stomach next, and slowly making their way to her tight twat. It was almost as if she was playing with herself in front of me...mocking me as she reveled in my humiliation, but I was powerless to look away, so enamored I was with her perfect, hypnotic, body. 

 Although she had been relatively friendly these last few days, the look on her face was one of sheer arrogance. It was as if she was saying, 'You wish you could have a body like this, don't you, you fat pig?' And she was not wrong. 

 I looked down at myself. A saggy belly with a little bit of a pooch. Tits, that compared to hers, just seemed meager, sad, and underdeveloped...almost non- existent. I looked back over at her and she had turned around. I now had a full-on view of her ass, and damn if it wasn't perfect too. Heart-shaped, perfectly firm, with two round, full cheeks. Something that any man would love to grab a hold of. She looked back at me, lathering up her hands and kneading her firm cheeks, as I fumed with jealousy...and envy. 

 She was perfect. Fucking perfect. I had to admit, I wanted a body like hers. I wanted that perfect ass. I wanted those huge tits. And I wasn't gonna get those by eating salads and rice cakes. I needed to get some fat on me to get tits like those. Losing weight wasn't the answer. My husband said my weight didn't matter to him, but it was becoming clear that huge tits did matter to him, so if I put on some weight, my tits would have to grow some. Right? I knew this line of thought had gotten me in trouble in the past, but like I said, losing weight wouldn't make my tits grow. 

 I imagined myself in her place, with me having her body. I imagined having her jutting breasts on my chest. I imagined me having her flat belly. I imagined me having her perfect ass. I would look so hot that way. As hot as her. If I had that body, I would show it off...and if she had mine, I would torment her as well. 

 But my own body tore through the fantasy, and as I looked down at my saggy body, my heart dropped. For the first time, I realized I could never have that body. I would only have this. This fat, disgusting, nasty belly. I looked at her perfect form again. She was blessed in a way I never could be, and no amount of hard work or diet was going to change that. 

 If I could trade places with her, I would in a heartbeat. She worked hard to stay in shape, but she didn't even have to. Even if she had a few extra pounds, it would only be the difference between being a hard body like her and being voluptuous and curvy like a porn star. She would always have a better body than me. No matter how much work I did, I would never be as voluptuous as her. Even if I lost all the weight I wanted, I would simply be flat and curveless. I would never have the curves that she did. I would never be as hot as Alexis. 

 That was how my diet came to an end. I could never be as good looking as Alexis, so what was the point of this training? I could never be the hottie on my husband's arm. I could never give him the curves he desired. I would just be the dumpy, overweight wife of a fit stud. I was tired of not eating. I was tired of even trying. I just didn't care anymore. Report_Story #7 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© That was why I snuck out after I got home, went out and pigged out on a nice, juicy burger. I'm sorry, but I needed to cheat on this diet. I needed real food. I don't know if it was comfort food, or stress eating, or whatever, but I felt so much better after eating it. 

 I couldn't get over the fact that Ben had checked out Alexis. Was he attracted to her? Part of me realized that if the three of us were in a room, they would be the two viewed as a couple. They were, in many ways, a perfect couple. They were both fitness freaks. They were both beautiful. It was infuriating. I obviously couldn't just confront him about it. But, I could remove the temptation. I knew he would never cheat or anything like that, but I knew it was a good idea to just remove the temptation of Alexis from our lives and be done with her for good. 

 We were in bed when I dropped the news on him. 

 "Honey, I think I would like it I could just go alone to the training sessions," I told him. 

 "Well, first you don't want me there, then you do, and now you don't. What gives?" he asked, not angry, just concerned and confused. 

 "Well, it's just, she's been better behaved, and I think at this point, I can handle her," I replied, making up an excuse to cover my real fears. 

 "Okay, I guess. If you need me to go again, just let me know," Ben said. 

 "I will," I told him, kissing him goodnight. 

 I don't know why I kept going to the training sessions. Maybe I was a masochist, I don't know. I just didn't want Ben to think I was a quitter. So I put in my time, and even though Alexis had been on her best behavior, my heart just wasn't in it any more. 

 I dreaded Alexis weighing me again, as my weight had no doubt gone up, as I indulged myself regularly after every session now. 

 ********** 

 (Alexis) 

 Success! Our swimming session had gotten better than I had ever hoped it would. I had given both members of the happy couple some good looks at my hot body, and they both reacted exactly as I predicted. 

 Ben had admired my bikini, while Shannon fumed in jealousy. But that was just the appetizer. I looked like a total slut wearing just that towel in the sauna. With my body, it's hard not to look like a skank in whatever you wear. Ben certainly noticed. I noticed him repeatedly sneak some peeks at my juicy cleavage. How could you blame him? Any man would have done the same. And I knew Shannon had seen her husband gawking at me. I noticed how angry she was. How jealous she was...and even better, how envious she was. It exuded from her. Tension filled the room, but Ben was too distracted to notice; but I felt it. That tension, that pure hatred she was radiating as she glowered in my direction was intoxicating. I could feel my juices dripping onto the bench. 

 But that was nothing compared to when I went into the showers. I knew she would be in there, and I just knew I could drive one last nail in her floundering self-image by showcasing my perfect form in front of her. I didn't say anything when I looked at her staring at me. I don't think she knew that she was doing it. I looked at her, and she looked at me. She stood there, flabby belly, pathetic tits, hairy bush, sour expression. I stood triumphant, flat belly, huge tits, trimmed cunt, satisfied expression. I was her superior in every way. I knew it, and she knew it. 

 The jealousy was pulsing out of her...it was intoxicating. So much so I could barely keep from simply masturbating in front of her; but I had to touch myself, knead and roll my big tits for her benefit, and just graze my convulsing, leaking, pussy, and sink my fingers into my firm ass. And all she could do was watch, mesmerized, as I played with my flawless body in front of her. She fucking hated me, but she was rendered powerless by her envy, her naked hunger for my body. I could tell from those sad, unblinking, eyes of hers that she wished our roles were reversed, and that she was the evil slut tormenting me...but that would never happen, and she knew it. No matter how hard she wished, how hard she worked, how much she dieted, she could never surpass me; her fate was to be my subordinate...my victim. 

 She hated that I was perfect. She hated that her husband had begun to notice. If this didn't drive her to eating, I don't know what would. 

 ********** 

 (Ben) 

 I don't know why, but Shannon seemed really down lately. I tried talking to her, but she said she was fine, and when if pressed, she would respond in anger. From what I knew, things were starting to turn around with her training. I figured I could just let it pass and she would return to normal. 

 We were sharing the bathroom, and I watched as she stepped on the scale. I was curious as to the results, not only for my wife's sake, but my wager with Alexis. I peered over Shannon's shoulder as the scale settled on her weight. 150 lbs. She was now five pounds heavier than her starting weight. Shannon said nothing. I leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. 

 "You'll get there babe. Don't worry," I whispered in her ear, trying to comfort her. She didn't say anything. She just continued on her routine. Today was the last day of my wager, and Alexis would be weighing her later on today. I knew right then I had already lost the bet. 

 I was running the next day, the usual route. I was not surprised to see Alexis jogging in my direction. She ran up to me as I slowed down. I noticed the small smile on her face. 

 "Don't look too satisfied," I said flatly, a little resentful. 

 "I told you," she started, "Some people need a firm hand. My methods have been tried and true. I've never been wrong." 

 "Well, the most important thing is that she has gained weight, weight she needs to lose," I shot back, refusing to admit that Alexis had been right after all; the carrot didn't work, so now it was back to the stick. 

 "Agreed. It's probably for the best that she doesn't want you showing up. Because this nice, friendly bullshit isn't working for me. She needs a firm hand and she's about to get it," Alexis said with a devious smile. 

 "Be tough, but be fair, that's all I ask," I pleaded, feeling a little guilty for having interfered at all; now I would be complacent in my wife's torment, unable to intervene...I would be as responsible for Shannon's torment as Alexis was. 

 "Of course," she said. "Now, if I do remember correctly, I think I've earned myself a running buddy." 

 "I suppose so," I sighed, relenting. 

 "Well, follow me. I hope you can keep up," she laughed playfully, turning and beginning to run. I quickly ran up to her and jogged alongside her. 

 "You need to keep an eye on your wife. There is no way she would be putting on this weight unless she was cheating on her diet. Keep an eye out on her. She might be compulsive," Alexis warned. 

 "What? What do you mean, compulsive?" I asked, raising a concerned eyebrow. 

 "She might be a compulsive eater. When things get stressful, uncomfortable, she eats to console herself. Eating is a comfort to her. It's like running, to us. We're both runners, so we know how it is. When we get stressed out, or when to let off some steam, we run. We exercise. She eats," Alexis said plainly, not breaking stride. 

 "I don't think that's the case. I've never seen her compulsively," I laughed in response. Sure Shannon had put one some weight, but she was dedicated to her training regimen...she'd never cheat on her diet. There had to be something else at work...her metabolism or something. Shannon would never let me down like that. 

 "Ben, I know what I'm doing. I've seen it before. Compulsive eaters are good at hiding it, because even as they are helpless to fight their compulsion, they know enough to be ashamed of it. She probably goes out, when you're not around or asleep," Alexis said. 

 "I'm not so sure..." I replied. 

 "Like I said, just keep an eye out," Alexis restated, firmly. I had to wonder, was Alexis right? Shannon wasn't a compulsive eater, was she? She was only a few pounds overweight. That couldn't be the case, could it? She had been busting her butt working out, but she still gained weight. The only possible reason was that she was eating. Sneaking around, behind my back, and eating, as if it was a shameful secret. Fact is, I had been noticing some strange behavior in Shannon lately; missing time from when she'd leave for her session with Alexis and arrive home, and occasionally I'd wake up in the middle of the night and she'd be gone or just getting back into bed. I had assumed she was just going to the bathroom, but this had been happening more recently than it had before. 

 As lost myself in thought, Alexis had gotten a few feet ahead of me. I couldn't help but admire her. She moved with a fluid grace about her, as if she was meant to be in motion at all times. She was a more natural runner than myself, I had to admit. Probably a better athlete. I am a pretty good runner, but even I had trouble keeping up with her pace. It wasn't until we began to wind down that I was able to catch up with her. I soon realized we had stopped in front of a house. 

 Her house. 

 "Nice place," I said. The house was large; two stories tall, and wide and sprawling, with an expansive backyard. It was more than enough to house multiple people, but as far as I knew, she was single. 

 "Thanks," Alexis said. 

 "Just you in there?" I asked. 

 "Yes. Strangely enough, guys get intimidated by me," she said with a laugh. That did not come as a surprise to me. She definitely seemed like a tough cookie. She definitely had a tough exterior. I had trouble imagining her letting a man get close. 

 "Well, don't worry, I'm not scared of you," I said with a smile. 

 "I know," she said coyly. After a pause, she added, "Honestly, if I didn't work, I probably wouldn't leave. I have everything I need here. I have all the gym equipment I need in the basement. I have a pool in the backyard. A nice big fence, so nobody can see what I get up to. If you thought the bikini I wore at the gym was scandalous, you should see the one I wear here," she said with a laugh. 

 I didn't know what to say to that. My mind flashed to what I had seen at the gym. Her body in that bikini. The way her boobs jutted out against her towel in the sauna. Her silky smooth cleavage as she sat next to me. I shook my head, clearing these dangerous images from my head. 

 "Everything I need in the privacy of my own home. Except a man, I suppose..." Alexis pondered out loud...suggestively. 

 "Well, uh, I'm sure it will happen sometime," I replied awkwardly, a little stunned by her brash flirtations, and even more by how stupid I had been to give her the opening, "I'd, uh, better get going." 

 "Okay, I'll see you tomorrow morning...partner," she said with a flirtatious wink, turning and walking back to her house. I stood there for a few seconds before I began to jog back home. 

 Today was one of Shannon's days off from training, but she did work, so she would be kept busy most of the day. I ran some errands and kept myself busy most of the day. 

 It was I was walking downtown and window shopping for an anniversary gift that I saw her...Shannon. She was in a restaurant, chowing down on a dish of pasta. A heavy pasta, smothered in a creamy looking sauce and covered in cheese, and pieces of sausage scattered throughout. I watched her scarfing this down in shock; she was taking big mouthfuls and barely chewing, eager to get to the next bite, as she shoveled the fattening, carbohydrate loaded, food into her face. She looked happier than I'd seen her in a long time, sitting there stuffing her face in secret. Alexis was right. Shannon was cheating on her diet. My wife was a compulsive eater, and worse...a liar. 

 I had to admit this made me upset. She had been complaining about not losing weight, and had been going off on Alexis time after time, but it seemed to me that the problem was Shannon after all. She had lied to me...had been lying to me all along. She said she had been sticking to her diet. She let me comfort her in weak moments. She let me feel bad for her...had let me blame myself for not defending her against Alexis, for making that stupid bet. And it was all a lie. 

 I stewed in anger the rest of the night. It only increased when Shannon came home and complained some more about dreading seeing Alexis. I had to admit I was a bit short with her. I started to think Alexis was right. Shannon needed a good kick in the ass if she wanted to lose weight. I loved her and I wanted her to happy, but she was just sabotaging herself and then blaming Alexis, who was just trying to do her job. Shannon needed to figure out what she wanted, and stop blaming her problems on others if she wanted to succeed. 

 The next morning, I was running alongside Alexis. I had gotten to know her a little better now, and was more comfortable around her. At first, I had thought that she was a wolf in sheep's clothing; there was something...predatory and unnerving about her. From what I had first heard about her from Shannon made me unfairly biased against her for the first little awhile. I thought she was just a bitchy, hard-ass, and an unrepentant cock tease. When I had first met her, I could sense she was putting up a façade of friendliness and charm, but now I was beginning to doubt my initial impression of her; she had been putting on a facade, but now I had begun to suspect that it was her bitchy, hard-as-nails, demeanor that was the facade...a way of motivating the unmotivated. I could respect that. In my experience, Alexis had been generally friendly, and she was clearly good at her job and extremely knowledgeable. After everything, I now realized that I liked Alexis. I liked her, and I respected her. She was not a bad person. 

 We stopped outside her house again, which was becoming something of a habit, as we began to cool down. As she wiped the sweat off her brow, I again couldn't help but notice how stunningly beautiful she was in the warm dawn sun. She was extremely pretty, and her body was incredibly voluptuous. Again, I am by no means a breast man, but it would be impossible for any virile male who would claim manhood to not be drawn to the steady rise and fall of her expansive chest as she breathed heavily. I wondered at what she had said before, about how she intimidated men, wondering as to her meaning. 

 "So..." Alexis started. "I think you should show up at our session today. To be honest, I think these sessions are coming to an end. I'm going to say my piece today, and I think both of you need to hear it. I think I've gotten to the bottom of the issues Shannon has, and, if I'm right, and these sessions come to an end, I want you to know that I am very willing to carry out more one-on-one sessions with you personally...maybe even outside of the gym. You know, we can continue these runs. I can show some of my own set-up here. I can think it would be extremely...beneficial." 

 I paused to take this in, before I replied, carefully considering my answer. 

 Shannon's betrayal hurt, but I still loved my wife...seeing Alexis on the sly, even in a professional capacity would cut Shannon even deeper, given how much she abhorred her trainer. The thing was, part of me did want to hurt her...she had not just lied to me, but lied to herself, and if she had been lying about something as small as sneaking out for food, what other lies had she been spoon feeding me over the years? 

 Beyond that, since I'd started working with Alexis, I felt good. Great, even. It felt good to push myself again, to test my limits, like I had back when I played football. I had never thought about how much I missed the thrill of exertion; not so much the conflict of competition, but the satisfaction of striving against the limits of your endurance. I worked out on my own, but Alexis challenged me. Alexis...brought out the best in me. And I wasn't sure I wanted to lose that. 

 It was that old chestnut about the rock and the hard place...and I wasn't willing to commit to either right now. 

 "Um, well, I guess I'll wait till I hear you out later, then I'll make any choices for the future then," I finally replied, non-committal. 

 Alexis' lips spread in what was becoming a familiar, confident, sly smile, "I look forward to it," was her ominous reply. 

 ********** 

 (Alexis) 

 How many more hints do I have to give to this guy that I want to fuck him? Jeeze. He was sweet, but a little dense. 

 I knew I had won him over, at least partially, to my side. I had turned on the charm, shown off my body, framed his wife, and he still resisted. His wife was getting fatter, yet he stayed loyal. The frustration and anticipation was maddening! 

 I could barely control myself after our last talk, and had to masturbate furiously almost immediately after I'd closed the door behind me; I had been so close! I had seen the hesitation in his eyes when I gave him the open invitation to keep our little trysts going even after I put the final nail in Shannon's coffin. A loyal, devout, husband wouldn't have hesitated to tell me to fuck off, but Ben did; I could see it in his eyes, that twinge of fear when I told him that I was cutting his wife off. He was afraid of losing me. He was so close, and just needed that final push. He had to want me, to need me. He had to desire me so fully that he would give no thought to any vows of commitment and loyalty that, to now, had held him back. 

 I had never had this much trouble bedding a man; but that just made it better. It would be so much sweeter when he was mine and mine alone. 

 But what to do now? Part of me thought the only way I could get him was to just throw him down and fuck him till he couldn't run from the pleasure. But that was so inelegant. Making him mine before he entered my sweet pussy would be so much sweeter. But how to do that? He was stubborn, clearly. He was clinging to his wife even though she had shown she was a physical and emotional mess. Any logical man would have jumped ship long ago. But not him. He was too naïve to know better. He was to naïve to realize any red-blooded man would have sought better pussy elsewhere. 

 I was swimming in my backyard pool, deep in thought. I went around and around in my head, trying to devise a plan. Ben is not even thinking about cheating; that is not even on his radar, but he was responding to me, engaging with me, becoming interested in me. He may have taken a few hurried glances at my body, he ran with me, he confided in me, but that was it. Those were the only signal he's given me, despite the numerous I've given him. 

 As I dried off and prepared to head to the gym, I reviewed my plan; a solution that would force Ben confront the truth. And once Ben confronted the truth, if he was the logical, intelligent, man I thought he was, he would have little choice but to ditch the wife and shack up with a slut like me. 

 The thought made my nipples hard. 

 ********** 

 (Shannon) 

 Even I had to admit, by this point I was pigging out on food; but, of course, none of the weight went to my chest. It all went to my belly...and my ass. My diet went off the rails, and I was becoming pear shaped and bottom heavy; even worse off than when I had started! 

 I was angry at how I had wasted these last few weeks. I was angry that I had put myself through all this crap to lose weight. I hated that I had fallen back into this mindset of compulsive eating. I knew it was ridiculous, but I couldn't stop myself. I wanted to lose weight, but I wanted to be voluptuous as well; a dangerous catch-22 that led to a vicious circle of frustration and depression, and my only comfort was food. I didn't know what to do. 

 It felt like I was in a daze as I walked into the gym that morning. Today felt different. It was one of those moments where you feel like some momentous, life changing event was hanging threateningly overhead. 

 I sat down on a weight bench and waited for Alexis to appear. I looked around the gym, waiting, taking in the surroundings. I was stunned when Ben entered instead. Report_Story #8 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© "What are you doing here?" I asked, confused and a little flabbergasted; I had specifically made sure he wouldn't be here today to witness my humiliation. It was going to be bad enough with Alexis' cruel judgmentality, much less watching Ben's disappointment...why was he here? 

 "Um, Alexis asked me to be here," Ben replied. 

 "What? When did she talk to you?" I hissed sharply, a little harsher than I had meant too; what was going on here? Were they talking behind my back? For how long? What was Alexis up to? 

 Before Ben could answer me, Alexis finally entered the room, interrupting us. The first thing I noticed was her outfit. Her outfits had returned to be doing more traditional over this past week, so it was a surprise to see today's outfit was the skimpiest one she had worn in any of our previous sessions; the brief, stretchy, purple top and the barely-there booty shorts. 

 Alexis walked up to us, and had a look on her face that I was used to. 

 She looked pissed off. 

 ********* 

 (Ben) 

 I had never seen Alexis look as angry as I did at this second. As she stood in front of us, I suddenly struck with worry as to what was about to happen. 

 "Okay, guys..." Alexis started, slowly, deliberately, "Let's get to work." 

 I was shocked by this. I had expected venom, not a normal workout. But what soon followed was no normal workout. 

 We started off with basic exercises. Alexis lead us, silently, through our warm-up stretching routine, speaking only to direct us as to which position to take next. We then did some push-ups. We watched as Alexis started doing them at a furious pace, her firm body bouncing up and down, her butt flexing tautly, as she powered through them. 

 We tried to keep up, but it was pointless. Shannon fell off the pace quickly. I kept up with Alexis for awhile before I got worn out. Shannon was completely worn out by the end, I was a little out of breath, but Alexis seemed just as relaxed as ever, except for the perpetual scowl on her face. 

 The tension in the air was heavy and foreboding, but Alexis still said nothing, as we continued. 

 Alexis next directed us to do crunches. She again set the pace, and we played catch-up. 

 As I tried to keep up, my eyes drifted to her. I watched her taut belly flex as she went up and down, her impressive abdominals on clear display. Shannon struggled to keep up, but for every crunch she did, Alexis did three. I realized I was distracted by watching Alexis, so I kept my eyes forward as I did my own crunches. 

 "Okay, Shannon, I want us to try something different," Alexis finally spoke, her usually melodious voice flat and serious; cold even. Shannon and I exchanged looks as Alexis led us through the gym. We entered a back room where stood something I had never seen in this gym before. A boxing ring. 

 "B-Boxing?" Shannon sputtered nervously. 

 "I figured I could show you a few moves," Alexis said in the same chilly monotone from earlier, stepping into the ring. 

 "Uh, okay," Shannon replied, unsure of what to do. She looked at me for support, but I had nothing to offer her; I had no idea what Alexis game was, but I had agreed to let this play out. I could step in at any time, if I felt it was getting to be too much for Shannon to take. 

 I waited outside the room as Alexis and Shannon put on gloves and helmets. Well, Shannon put on a helmet, but Alexis didn't. I thought that was strange. 

 "Okay, just watch how I punch," Alexis said, with stone-faced seriousness. She extended her firm strong arm with a sharp, clean, snap, as she punched the air. Shannon tried to copy her motion, but her movements where awkward and hesitant; I knew for a fact that she'd never been in a fight in her life, and had no idea how to throw a punch. After a few minutes, they progressed to the point where Shannon was punching at Alexis's gloves. I'm sure that part of her enjoyed punching at Alexis, and could see the hint of a smile on her upturned lips. This went on for a bit before Alexis spoke. 

 "Good...good. Wanna have a quick sparring match?" Alexis offered abruptly with a sweet smile, finally cracking that stone-face with a bit of the warmth I'd become accustomed too. This sudden change of demeanor actually started Shannon, taking her by surprise. 

 "Uh, I'm not sure," Shannon replied cautiously. 

 "C'mon. I'll be gentle," Alexis promised, turning to me, "You wanna see this, right Ben? I know how much you guys love chick fights, right?" 

 I just smiled lightly, unsure where this was going, my only response being a barely perceivable nod. My hands tightened on the ropes. What was she up to? 

 "Okay, I guess," Shannon relented, her voice lacking confidence in her agreement. Alexis guided her into the proper stance before took her own stance. 

 

 "Let's go, count of three, ok?" Alexis said, putting her hands up to guard her face, Shannon following suit, "1...2...3!" 

 Shannon gingerly moved around, unsure what to do, while Alexis danced deftly around her, light on her feet. She had finally the opportunity for a little revenge for all the crap Alexis gave her, and she took it! 

 Too bad all the anger that Alexis had inspired only led to a single, off-center punch that Alexis easily dodged, laughing, "Oh, you can do better that that! Give it another go; C'mon!" 

 Shannon grit her teeth and grunted, throwing another couple of punches her way, but Alexis again easily danced around them. 

 Alexis looked right at home in the ring. She was simply exceptional at whatever she did. She moved around smoothly, with no wasted motion; the only exception being the hypnotic jiggling of her chest and the enticing bouncing of her butt. I force myself to look away and tried to keep my eye on Shannon, who was growing increasingly frustrated, swinging wildly and finding only air, as Alexis danced and mocked her, dodging and weaving around her sloppy, beyond amateurish, attempts to punish her. 

 Then Alexis looked at me; our eyes met for a brief moment, and her plush lips spread in that familiar, sly, smile. At that moment, I saw the veneer drop. I saw her drop the act. I stepped towards the ring, trying to stop the fight, when, quick as a flash, Alexis lunged forward, drilling my wife with a mean right hook. The punch hit her helmet, so it simply dazed her. 

 "C'mon, Shannon, come at me! Give me your best shot!" Alexis said loudly, "Stop trying to hit me and HIT ME! C'mon, I'll even give you a free shot. Right here," she added, knocking on her firm abs with her gloved hand. I glanced at her abs, and they looked like liquid steel as they flexed under her smooth skin. Fully formed, but still having a certain softness. 

 I watched as Shannon steadied herself, inhaling deeply and exhaling as she steeled herself, reaching down deep, and finally lunged forward and shot a punch directly at Alexis's stomach with a bitter, angry cry. I watched as the blow land, and I saw my wife shoot back immediately, grabbing her wrist in pain. 

 "Shit!" Shannon called out, flicking her wrist, her face screwed up, trying to ease the pain. 

 Alexis started to laugh at this, as if it was the funniest thing she'd ever seen, quipping, "Don't hurt yourself now; that's supposed to be my job!" 

 I could see Shannon's blood begin to boil. She again lunged forward, swinging wildly at Alexis mocking face, determined to shut her up. 

 Alexis batted Shannon's punch away dismissively, and in one smooth motion, caught my wife in the jaw, which made a sickening crack, rattling her teeth. She fell onto her butt and I leapt onto the ring apron. 

 "Face it, Shannon, you'll never be as good as me," Alexis mocked, dancing around, her breasts bouncing tauntingly. Even as I couldn't keep my eyes off of Alexis' bouncing boobs, neither could Shannon, and I knew the complex she had about her body; this was cruel and petty humiliation. 

 "What was that?" I said, angry. This was getting out of hand. 

 "What? We're just sparring," Alexis scoffed with a playful pout, dismissing my objection. 

 "That wasn't a gentle jab," I said, helping Shannon up. "We should move on to something else now, don't you think? You've proven your point." 

 "No, it's okay. Let's keep going," Shannon spat angrily with a newfound resolve, shooting me an angry glare. I stepped back as Shannon rose unsteadily, still disoriented from the head rattling punch, and resumed her fighting stance. Alexis said. 

 "Shannon...you don't have to do this," I warned, concerned for my wife's well being. What was she thinking? What was she trying to prove...she was playing right into Alexis' hand, and it was obvious that she was no match for the more obviously skilled and physically able trainer. 

 "I'll be okay," she repeated, more firmly this time. With a new head of steam she charged at Alexis and put everything into a single punch, but her enraged scream telegraphed her intent and Alexis was more than prepared for her. 

 Alexis was able to pin her arm around Shannon's and torque her it around her back with a violent jerk. She roughly pushed her to the corner face first. I was frozen in place. Alexis looked back at me as she held my wife down. 

 "Face it, Shannon, you will never be as good as me," Alexis repeated, reinforcing her earlier statement, as Shannon struggled futilely against her. 

 "What are you doing?" Shannon whined, scared, "Stop!" 

 "Is this an impressive performance, Ben? Are you filled with pride?" Alexis teased, looking over her shoulder at me, and giving her tight rear a little wiggle. 

 I couldn't find words. Alexis threw Shannon to the mat dismissively and stood towering over her. Shannon leaned up on her elbows, looking up at Alexis, who taunted cruelly, "I'm taking it easy on you, Shan. If you can't handle this, how are you ever gonna get a body like mine?" 

 "Hey!" I said, finally stepping into the ring. This had gone far enough, "That's enough! Leave her alone!" 

 Alexis held out her arm stopping me, then she spun around, so her ass was practically in my wife's prone, pained, face. 

 "You'll never get an ass like this at this rate, fatty," Alexis said, kneeling a bit, pushing her ass closer to my wife's face, giving it a mocking wiggle, forcing Shannon to recoil in disgust at the sight of her perfect, round, glutes. "It's okay, take a whiff. It's the closest you'll ever get to an ass this good." 

 "What are you doing?" Shannon protested. I ran over to her defense, and as I did, Alexis stepped back and shook her head in disappointment. 

 "You can wish and pray and dream you looked like me all you want, but we all know it ain't gonna happen," Alexis teased, mean spirited and cruel, "It's impossible for a tub of fat like you to ever look as hot as me." 

 "What the hell is this?" I said in shock, "You're supposed to be helping her, you bitch!" 

 I don't know why I let this happen. Why I was frozen in place. Why didn't I leap to my wife's aid immediately. I pulled my wife to her feet and led her out of the ring. Alexis followed. 

 "Ben," Alexis said, starting to circle us, unlacing her gloves, "I think I have come to the heart of the matter. I think I know why Shannon is putting on weight. I think it is a problem that both of you share, and admitting the truth will make things so much easier." 

 Alexis paused, waiting until she had our full attention before she continued with her theorizing, "The problem is awareness of who you are, Shannon. I think it's time to be open and honest about what you are. Shannon; you are fat!" Alexis said emphatically, with all seriousness. 

 "Excuse me?" Shannon blurted out, astonished by Alexis' blunt boldness. 

 "Hey!" I said. 

 "It's the truth, and that's the problem. Neither of you are willing to come to terms with the fact the Shannon is fat. And that is the problem. Ben, you have let your wife think it is okay to be as heavy as she is. And it's not. It's really not," Alexis impressed upon us passionately, a disgusted sneer on her face as she looked up and down Shannon's form. 

 "She's not fat!" I interjected, exasperated, "Who just says that!?! What kind of trainer are you! That's just recklessly irresponsible!" 

 Alexis brushed off my outburst and looked me straight in the eye, "Your wife is an obese woman in a fat woman's body. Some women are meant to be fat, and this one is a prime example. She is living a lie. She's tried to be skinny, but it doesn't take. I am the best personal trainer in the state, which is why you came to me, highly recommended, mind you, in the first place, and I could do nothing with her," Alexis said. I was stunned into silence. I looked at Shannon, and she was equally stunned. 

 "Your wife has no motivation to change, as long as you keep telling her it's okay to be fat. She needs to know there are severe repercussions if she doesn't lose the weight, but you keep enabling her, telling her it doesn't matter, that you'll still find her attractive and love her no matter how she looks, so she has no motivation to actually lose the weight. It's just a sympathy game for her to play the embattled victim to the 'cruel' woman trying desperate to help her," Alexis paused and took my hand in hers, squeezing it emphatically, "Ben, if there is any part of you that wants her to lose weight, for her health and self esteem, you need to let her know that you don't want to be married to a fat woman." 

 "I'm not fat, you cunt!" Shannon shot back, incredulous. 

 "Yes...yes you are! Ben might not be ready to admit it...yet, but I know it. You are a fat, nasty, disgusting tub of lard. I don't know how you scored Ben. He could obviously have done so much better," Alexis bluntly. This was a nightmare! It had to stop. 

 "Love is about a hell of a lot more than weight! I thought there was some good in you, but I was clearly wrong," I said, ready to take Shannon by the hand and lead her away from this crazed woman. 

 "Yeah, you were wrong. You wanted to meet the real me? Well, here you go darling! No more of that fake-nice bullshit. This is the real me, right here. I am not a good person, but Ben, I do want some good in me. I want a nice big, fat piece of good in me," Alexis said, holding my gaze with her serious grey eyes. 

 "W-What are you saying?" I sputtered, shell-shocked; this couldn't be happening. 

 "As I said before, you need to show that wife of yours the penalties of being an overweight, emotional mess," Alexis said plainly, "She needs to know that if she keeps putting on weight, you will leave her. She needs to know that if she doesn't get her shit together, you will begin to seek better pussy elsewhere." 

 "What!?! Of course not! I would never..." I started, but Alexis promptly interrupted. 

 "Yes, you would. But you're not ready to admit that, yet, are you? But Shannon knows, deep down, that it's the truth, and she is terrified of that. She is terrified that you will leave her. She's seen the signs, just like I have. She knows that you've already begun to check out other women," Alexis said. 

 "That's bullshit! I've never checked out anyone else," I scoffed, "This is just ridiculous and baseless slander!" 

 "Now, I know you're lying, as does she, because we've both seen you do it. Haven't we Shannon?" Alexis said, looking at my wife. Shannon looked up at both of us, tears in her eyes. 

 "We all know the truth, Ben. I saw it, and Shannon saw it," Alexis repeated, as I looked back and forth between them. 

 "Saw what?" I said angrily. 

 "We all know that you've been checking me out, Ben," Alexis said. 

 "That's not true," I replied, stepping back, dumbfounded. 

 "There's no need to lie, Ben. You can be completely honest with me. Even though I have made your wife's life hell, that didn't stop you from checking out my body. That didn't stop you from checking out my tits," Alexis said, taking a step towards me, glancing down at her chest, trying to guide my eyes to them. 

 Alexis squared her shoulders, causing them to thrust out tantalizingly, insistently, in my direction, demanding my attention, and I couldn't help but glance at her breasts on display, but for only a split second, before I met her eyes. I was stunned into silence. I couldn't speak. 

 "You're not ready to admit it yet, Ben, but you want me," Alexis said softly, walking her fingers up my chest flirtatiously. I jumped back, as if burned. Alexis turned to look at Shannon. 

 "Did you know me and your husband have been running together? Every morning, for the last few weeks. Me and him, alone. Did he not tell you that? Hmm. Wonder why?" Alexis said smugly, her plump, full, lips spreading in a devious smile. 

 "Shannon, it's not what it sounds like..." I tried to explain, seeing the hurt in her eyes; it hurt me worse than a punch to the gut. 

 "But you have been running with her?" Shannon asked, tears beginning to stream down her cheeks. 

 "Yes, but it was nothing more than that. I was just trying to feel her out. Make sure she was sane, for you. I was clearly wrong," I said, turning back to Alexis accusingly. 

 "Hey, now. You were singing a different tune before. You kept complimenting me. Telling me what a great athlete I am. Shannon, I had him convinced by the end that I was right. That you needed a kick in the ass to lose weight. But he didn't tell you that, did you? Hmm... whole lot of secrets he's keeping. Makes you wonder what else he's hiding," Alexis hinted, her normally cold eyes alight with hateful glee as she tore into my marriage like a rabid dog into a wounded rabbit. I looked at Shannon, and she looked back at me. Hurt. Accusatory. 

 "I'll leave you two to sort this out. I think you two have a lot to talk about," Alexis said to both of us. Then she turned to me. She walked towards me and I stumbled back, retreating, trying to avoid her. I hit the wall behind me and she stopped within inches of me as she blocked my view of Shannon. Before I could even think of moving, she reached forward with one hand and roughly, firmly, grabbed my penis. My, unbeknownst to me, erect, rock hard, penis. 

 "Once you smarten up and ditch the wifey, you know where to find me," she whispered seductively, licking her plush, pink, lips. Her hand massaged the length of my dick. This distracted me, so I wasn't able to defend myself when she leaned forward and softly pressed her lips to mine. I did not return the kiss, by any means, but I could feel the raw, aggressive, passion in her lips. She pulled away and stepped out of the room before I could react. As soon as the door shut, I met Shannon's gaze. 

 "How could you?" she asked, sobbing, tears flowing freely. Her emotions were obviously twisted up; some confused mixture of regret, anger, and self-pity. 

 "I'm not cheating on you, I swear to God! I would never do that to you. Especially with her. She's evil...you know this!" I pleaded with my crying, hurt, wife. 

 "Why didn't you tell me that you were spending time with her? Why did you lie?" she accused, her voice a barely understandable whining screech. 

 "I didn't lie. I didn't tell you because I didn't think it needed telling, because it was nothing. She sought me out, I didn't seek her. I didn't want to make things more difficult for you, so I didn't pick a fight," I said. 

 "But you did check her out. I saw it," she sobbed, "We all saw it!" 

 "If I did, it wasn't on purpose. I did it without thinking," I said, making excuses I know I had no excuse for. She was correct, of course, I had checked out Alexis. It was a reflex, and uncontrollable urge, but I had done it, unable to control my own impulses. 

 "Do you think she's attractive?" Shannon asked, arms crossed, hugging her sagging belly in comfort, rocking back and forth. 

 "No. She's beautiful, yes, but after seeing the real her, no thanks," I firmly, hopefully convincingly. 

 "Did she kiss you? Just now?" she asked. I couldn't find any words, "Did she?" 

 "She kissed me, I didn't kiss her," I said, hoping she would believe me. Report_Story #9 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© "Do you look at other women? Aside from Alexis?" she continued her inquisition. 

 "No, of course not. I love you. Only you," I pleaded, taking a step towards her, only to see her recoil. 

 Shannon paused for a long time before she asked, "Do you think I'm fat?" 

 "No, not at all. Like I've said all along, it doesn't matter how much you weigh. It doesn't matter to me, so it shouldn't matter to you," I said. I was struck by the irony of it all...I was saying exactly the things Alexis had accused me of earlier; excusing Shannon's weight. That horrid bitch had a way of twisting your words against you, mixing up lies and the truth like a martini. 

 "See, right there, that's pretty much an admission that you think I'm fat. It doesn't matter how much I weigh? That pretty much tells me all I need to know. You didn't say that I'm thin. You didn't say that I'm perfect as is, you just said you don't care that I'm fat!" Shannon babbled incoherently, her eyes wild. 

 "Shannon, I never asked you to lose weight. You did this to yourself. Don't put words in my mouth," I raised my voice, getting a little angry. 

 "So, it's my fault I'm fat, that's what you're saying?" Shannon asked. 

 "No, it's not what I'm saying!" I said loudly. She stood up and grabbed her stuff, "You're twisting things all out of proportion! You're only hearing what you want to hear!" 

 "You said it didn't my weight didn't matter, but it obviously does! I did this for you, but you lied to me! You wanted me to lose weight!" Shannon cried, hysterical, "Liar! Big fat Liar!" 

 Things were becoming heated, and I was getting angry, frustrated, Shannon had me backed up against a wall. She wasn't listening to a thing I said, twisting my words to paint herself as the victim. I was getting desperate...and would regret what I said next. 

 "You're one to talk...I know, Shannon. I know you've been cheating on your diet," I snapped. Shannon's eyes went wide, and she opened her mouth, about to speak, but shut it, "I saw you, eating that big, cheese covered, sausage filled pasta...not even two days ago." 

 Shannon didn't say anything, but I could see her hand ball up into a tight fist, and begin to shake. She just stared at me. I continued. 

 "You spent all this time demonizing Alexis, and God knows she deserves it, but it's not like you tried! You chose this, not me, and then you didn't even do what needed to be done; you just whined and complained and looked for sympathy where you knew you'd find it...all the while blaming Alexis. She may be a bitch; she may have been specifically targeting you, but you didn't listen to her either. She may be an evil bitch, but this here, how you look, the weight you've gained, that...is...not...her...fault! Or mine. It's yours." 

 Shannon and I stared at each other. I felt a knot in my stomach; a sinking, sickly, feeling. I had gone too far, and I could see it in Shannon's eyes; that mixture of hurt...and anger. Betrayal. 

 "Well, maybe you shouldn't come home tonight," Shannon said coldly, wiping her eyes, her tears dried, "Cause I can see how much you didn't enjoy that kiss!" Shannon spat, stalking briskly past me. I looked down and realized I was still rock hard from Alexis' earlier tender ministrations. 

 What do I do? I came in here in a good mood, but now my marriage was going down faster than the Hindenburg; a giant flaming wreck! And all because of Alexis. 

 I felt bad for not believing Shannon before. I now knew the truth; Alexis was evil incarnate. She was a scheming, deceitful, cunning and cruel little bitch! This wasn't part of some grand scheme to help Shannon lose weight...she didn't care about my wife's health and self-esteem. This was her trying to break up our marriage for her sick pleasure. 

 If there was one thing I knew for sure about Alexis, it was that I would never see her again. 

 ********** 

 I stayed at a buddy's house for a few days while things cooled down between Shannon and I. I tried to call her every day, I stopped by the house, but she was never there when I showed up. 

 I changed up my running path so there was no chance I would run into Alexis. Obviously, neither me nor Shannon were still attending that gym. So, I made due like I normally did, running and working out a the school. 

 I was running more than usual. Harder. I vented my frustrations by running myself into exhaustion, day and night. I ran like the devil was chasing me, but I didn't even notice. My mind was someplace else. I had nothing else going on during the days, so it gave me time to think things over. 

 I hated Alexis. I hated the nasty things she had said and done. I hated her arrogance, and how recklessly malevolent, how deeply evil she was. But I had to grudgingly admit that she might have raised a good point. 

 I might have been giving Shannon mixed signals. I had to ask myself the obvious question: Do I think my wife is fat? 'No, I don't', I told myself, 'She is not fat.' Sure, she is a few pounds overweight; I know she has struggled to keep her weight down over the years. Nature dealt her some bad cards. She wanted to be skinny, but it seemed like her genetics wouldn't allow it. It seemed like her genetics were telling her she should be heavy. It seemed like she was meant to be fat. 

 I shook my head, clearing those thoughts. Damn! I was beginning to think like Alexis, despite myself...those were her words, not mine. My mind was then drawn to her; my wife's evil personal trainer. 

 I had made a mistake. I had thought she was just trying to be tough for motivational purposes, but that obviously wasn't the case. She seemed to be evil for the sake of evil; seemed to revel in it, enjoy it...get off on it, tearing into our marriage, turning husband against wife. Breaking Shannon's spirit, telling her that she was fat and that I couldn't find her attractive. How could anyone say the things she did, just for kicks? It was just so.... mean. Most people might think these things, but never say them. She didn't care. She didn't have that filter. She was that bold. That ballsy. That evil. 

 It was a shame because, I had to admit, it was impossible not to; Alexis was stunningly gorgeous. No one could ever call her fat. She was fit, strong, but still unmistakably, undeniably, feminine. It seemed like all of her extra weight went to her giant breasts. As much as I hated her, I had to admit her body was fabulous. Those big, attention getting, breasts, and her firm, muscular butt, her classically beautiful face...she was like a renaissance sculpture come to life; the female version of the Vitruvian Man...the perfect physical specimen. It was a shame she was rotten to the core, in dark, dangerous, contrast her beautiful exterior. 

 I felt like there was a lead weight in my belly. I wanted this tension to be over. I wanted my wife back. I wanted the love of my life back. I wanted my routine back. I wanted to sleep in my bed, in my house...I wanted things back to normal. I'd had enough excitement. 

 About two weeks passed until I got word from Shannon. She called me and told me she wanted me to come home so we could talk...work things out. I was ecstatic as I got in my car and I nearly broke the speed limit. 

 I wondered why she had waited so long to get in contact with me. We've had fights before, but she rarely stays mad for more than a day or so. She had to know I would never cheat. She had to know what Alexis said was bullshit. Part of me wondered if maybe she had a surprise cooked up for me. Part of me considered the fact, that maybe she had used what Alexis had said as motivation. Maybe she busted her butt and had trimmed the weight, to prove me...I mean, Alexis...wrong. Maybe she waited so long because she wanted to debut the all-new her. I couldn't wait to see her. 

 I pulled into my driveway, and I walked quickly to the door, filled with anxious anticipation. As I climbed the steps onto the patio, the door opened. There was my pretty wife, standing silhouetted and backlit in the doorway, with a light smile. I stepped up to her and hugged. God, I missed her. But as I stepped back and got a good look at her, I had a thought that I had never had before. My wife looked, kind of... chunky. I had hoped that she would use what had happened as motivation, but that was not the case. It looked she had easily put on another ten, fifteen pounds. But I couldn't let her know this bothered me. I mean, it didn't bother me. I pulled her in for a kiss, and she returned it. I could feel the wetness from her tears against my cheeks, as we embraced. 

 "I missed you so much," I whispered to her. 

 "I missed you too," she whispered back. 

 We had an emotional heart to heart over the next few hours, putting all our cards on the table. We vowed to be completely honest about everything. I knew what she wanted to hear when she asked if I thought she was fat. I didn't tell her that her weight didn't matter. I told her, sure, she wasn't the skinniest girl around, but that did not bother me one iota. I loved her for who she was. I told her I thought she was beautiful, and she didn't have to do anything to fix herself. I loved her as is. 

 She said she trusted me. She knew that I would never cheat on her. She knew I loved her. 

 We came to an agreement that what had happened wasn't because of either one of us. It was because of Alexis. She was our agreed upon scapegoat...and we were happy for it. 

 We both cried quite a bit that night. I knew our re-strengthened bond would require one more thing before we were truly back together. We needed to go to bed together. We needed to make love. In our more playful moments, I would lift her over my shoulder and carry her to the bedroom. I felt this moment called for a callback to happier times, so as we finished dinner, I hefted her over my shoulder, with considerable effort. She must have been up to 175-180lbs now...it had taken all my strength to get her over my shoulder, and it was a good thing she couldn't see the pained expression face as I stomped slowly, heavily, up the stairs to our bed room. I could feel a thin sheen of sweat break out on my brow as I struggled against gravity, weighed down by my heavy set wife...but I refused to let on how tough this was; to give Shannon any reason to think that she was too heavy for me to sweep her off her feet...too fat for romance. She giggled and laughed, but I couldn't tell her I strained a muscle in my back lifting her, the pain throbbing insistently. 

 I dropped her onto the bed, and I quickly crawled on top of her, my mouth meeting hers. Our arms fought with each other as we tried to remove each other's clothes. Very quickly, we were both naked in front of each other. As she passed a condom to me, I looked her over. I hated to say it, but I had never seen her with this much extra weight. She had always had some extra pounds around the edges, which was fine, but now, she had much more than that. Her stomach was more rotund than usual, and what had been a bulge had become a gut, and her thighs thick and jiggly. But that shouldn't matter, right? She was still the woman I loved inside, not matter what she looked like...that was what was important. 

 I crawled on top of her, kissing my way up her chest, before circling my tongue across her nipples. I reached to squeeze them with my hands, but it felt like I had trouble getting a good hold of them, as if they weren't big enough to hold. I had never really had that issue before. I made my way up and met her lips with mine. As I kissed my wife, I placed my protected dick against her vagina. At this point, Shannon was not ready for kids, which was fine. I could wait. 

 I began to pump my dick inside of her, slowly. I always felt like Shannon was very delicate. She was my wife. My soul-mate. I couldn't treat her roughly. I didn't want to. So, as always, I took it easy on her. I pumped slowly, but surely, driving myself into her. 

 I looked at my wife's pretty face, scrunched up in pleasure. Her eyes were closed, and she was biting her lower lip. I kissed her neck as we thrust together. She was moaning in my ear. She rarely talked as we made love. I could always tell when she was close as her moans would grow into high pitched squeals. One thing about her was that she could orgasm pretty easily, so it didn't take long for me to get her off. I could usually outlast her. And tonight was no exception. I felt her vagina tighten around me as she moaned in pleasure as she came. I was still thrusting as she came down from her plateau. 

 "Oh, baby. You wore me out." she groaned, her breathing labored, covered in sweat, her eyes heavy lidded and tired, her stamina spent. I could tell she was done for the evening. 

 "C'mon baby, finish up," She said with a smile. That was the extent of her talking during sex. 

 I drove into her, and as I neared my climax, I thrust harder. Shannon whimpered, her face screwed up in pain. 

 "Ben, slow down...you're hurting me," she whined, "You know I can't take you that deep." 

 I backed off, slowing my thrusts, pulling back, not penetrating as deep. This was typical for our sex life, and it usually didn't bother me...I was hardly of average size, and Shannon was so delicate, I was usually content to take things slow...but tonight, I really needed it. I was frustrated, hungry for sex, for release...I had lost control. 

 I groaned loudly as I finally managed to achieve orgasm, and filled the condom with my seed. I fell off of her, temporarily sated. I caught my breath as my dick lilted a bit, but remained erect, throbbing slightly. I never told her, but there were sometimes I wished we could keep going, but she was usually too tired for it. I don't want to come across as some incredible lover with insane stamina, but I had a healthy appetite for sex, and, to be honest, Shannon didn't. It wasn't a big deal. She kept me satisfied as best she could. 

 Tonight was one of those nights. I disposed of the condom as Shannon curled up, exhausted and spent. I cleaned up a bit, and by the time I got back to bed, she was asleep. I lay down next to her and tried to fall asleep, but my mind was racing. I looked at her under the sheets, and part of me was disappointed in her. 

 She had gone on and on about trying to lose weight; she was desperate to do so, but after motivation of all kinds; positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, support and spite; she had gained weight...a lot of weight. I realized there was no form of motivation that would get through to her. If what Alexis had said didn't spur her on, nothing would. Alexis was, to a point, right. The reason she wasn't losing weight because I told her she was okay as is. She was complacent, happy with her marriage, happy with herself. And I should have been too, right? 

 Her weight didn't matter to me. It shouldn't, at least. But there was a limit. Of course I would like a woman who was in shape. Not for any hollow reason like looks, but for health reasons. I wanted to be with a healthy woman. I was a healthy guy, and I wanted someone who could keep up with me; that's not asking much...there's nothing wrong with wanting my wife to be healthy, to live a long life at my side...physical attractiveness had nothing to do with it; I wasn't that shallow. But I could very easily see Shannon had gotten carried away in my absence; indulged herself in every excess. She had issues with food, and genetics were not in her favor. Her mother was a big woman, and suffered from heart problems, having suffered a minor heart attack last year. It didn't bother me before; Shannon had never been as heavy as her mother; but now, it made me worry. 

 Would I be okay with an overweight wife; an unhealthy wife? I mean, I put in the time, working out, not just for my own benefit, but for Shannon's sake...I wanted to spend a long, healthy, life with her. I wanted to be there for her and for our children in the future. 

 It irritated me a bit that Shannon hadn't returned the favor. I was disappointed in her lack of dedication in that regard. She talked the talk, but she did not walk the walk. Say what you will about Alexis, she clearly had the drive to stay fit and healthy. 

 Would it be okay, in ten years, if Shannon, this girl I loved, this woman I married, was obese, and at risk of cardiac arrest? Her mother was, and if things kept going this way, she would too. I saw no reason why I would not stay fit. But if she did not put in the effort, her weight would get away from her. 

 At this point, I could not ask her to lose some weight. That's bad form for a man anyway, and with recent events, that was a no go. I would have to accept the inevitable. I would have to admit the truth. Once again, Alexis was right. 

 My wife is fat. 

 ********** 

 (Shannon) 

 Things were going great since Ben had come back to me...time seemed to stop when he was gone, but now things where back to normal, and everything seemed to be moving so fast. Our anniversary was coming fast, and it irked me that I wouldn't meet my goal of losing weight...in fact, I would probably have to spend our anniversary almost 40lbs over my original weight. This was a huge personal failure for me. Whenever I looked in the mirror, my reflection stared back with shame. This was not how I wanted to be, and Ben deserved much better. 

 

 Despite what had been said during...the incident...Ben had been right. I had overreacted; he had been nothing but supportive, but I had overreacted to his words...and I had cheated on my diet. I had let Alexis get to me. Let my lack of success affect my self-esteem, and had eaten to comfort myself. This had to stop. 

 As much as I hated Alexis, I had used her awful words to motivate me; no more self pity! I had started at a new gym, and it was going pretty well. My goal was getting close to my original starting weight, before I had met Alexis. I knew that my husband had been happy with me at that weight, and he didn't care if I was fat or thin. I figured I could recover from the damage Alexis had done, then move on and resume my normal, happy, life. 

 Everything would be fine...things were going to turn around for me, I just knew it! 

 ********** 

 (Ben) 

 Things had been good for awhile. Things returned to our typical daily routine, and that should have made me happy. But it didn't. I was relieved to hear when Shannon told me that she was going back to the gym, but as time went on, I didn't notice much of a change. She still looked kinda...fat. 

 Why did I keep thinking about all of the crap that Alexis brought up? I had admitted to myself that Shannon was fat. I didn't want to think like this, but now that I had, I couldn't stop doing so. 

 Her weight had never bothered me before, but now, I couldn't stop noticing it. Every time I saw her eating something unhealthy, it bugged me. She had stopped trying to lose weight, and it shouldn't bug me that she was putting on weight, but it did. I just wanted to go back to the time when I wanted to have sex with her. I just couldn't find the drive to get really turned on by her anymore. I wanted her to lose weight so I could let myself be attracted to her again. I had trouble getting it up around Shannon lately, and had started making excuses...I was tired, I wasn't in the mood. The truth was that I desperately needed to fuck, but I couldn't bring myself to fuck my wife. 

 I was horny and frustrated, and I was taking it out on her. I'm sure she noticed something was up. I tried to be the man I was before, but I just couldn't. Did that make me a bad person? Did it make me a bad husband to say I wish my wife was skinnier? Did it make me a bad husband to say I wish my wife could maintain a healthy weight? Did it make me a bad husband to wish that my wife was fit? 

 Fit like Alexis? 

 I don't know why I kept thinking about Alexis; she was an evil, manipulative bitch. She was rotten to the core. In many ways, all ways, she was the opposite of my wife. Report_Story #10 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© Shannon was blonde, short, pretty, nice but overweight. Alexis was a brunette, tall, gorgeous, evil, but in incredible shape. Shannon had a beautiful soul, while Alexis hid her corrupt core with superficial beauty. 

 Despite her obvious maliciousness, there were some things I did begrudgingly admire about her. She was dedicated to physical fitness and personal health. She was undeniably beautiful. But she was nasty. She had said horrible, hateful, things. She was awful to Shannon, and she had shown herself to be capable of deception by how seemingly friendly she was to me. It was incredible how well she hid the true her. But most worrying was the fact that she had made advances towards me and had done so brazenly. 

 Alexis had kissed me. And she had literally had me by the balls; in front of my wife! But what made it more worrying was that I had reacted, becoming erect and hard...painfully so. 

 Why? 

 Why had my dick reacted so uncontrollably to her touch? She had been berating my wife, insinuating that I should be cheating on Shannon, insinuating that I was attracted to her, whispering like the Devil in my ear, tempting me, and all of that made me rock hard? 

 Why? 

 Maybe it was just a spontaneous erection? I still got those, as did most men...but I knew that wasn't the answer. I hated to say it, but it was the only logical answer, if I was to be honest with myself. The truth is...I was attracted to Alexis. 

 I didn't want to do anything with her, of course. It was just, yes, she was a very attractive woman. Not just attractive, but incredibly gorgeous. But she was so nasty. So mean. But the thing was, I had met plenty of attractive girls without my dick responding like that. Sure, Alexis was among the top tier of attractive women I had ever seen, but that wasn't the only reason I responded. It couldn't be. But what was it about Alexis that made me respond? Was it her body? 

 I had to admit, her body was out of this world. She was in amazing shape, but she still maintained her attractiveness. Her sexiness. Her ass was firm round, and muscular. And her boobs were insane! I honestly don't know how she was able to do all the things she was able to do athletically when she was so...top heavy. How could she be so slim and in shape while maintaining those massive globes? I swear 90 percent of her body fat was packed in her bra. 

 Okay, her body was amazing; possibly the best body I had ever seen on a woman. But was it just that that made me erect? Maybe it was her confidence. Confidence was definitely a very attractive feature in a woman, at least to me. When I first met Shannon, she seemed confident, so sure of herself, but as the years went on that confidence seemed to fade. I watched over the years as some of her issues came to the surface; lack of confidence, jealousy, anxiety...body-image issues. Yes, Shannon had a lot of issues that stemmed from a lack of confidence and self assuredness. 

 But Alexis, on the other hand, she was confident to the point of being arrogant, smug...haughty. Her body was amazing. She was spectacularly fit. She had unwavering belief in her own superiority, and there was very little argument to be made against that. Nature had blessed her in many ways, and she was not afraid to let anyone else know that. She showed off her body every chance she could. She wore skimpy gym outfits, picked to highlight her robust features. She picked clothes made of tight, stretchy material, calling attention to see her jiggling assets. And she had gone out of her way to openly flaunt herself for my benefit; giving me teasing peeks and glimpses. I didn't realize it at first, but looking back, I could now see all times she had shown off her body in front of me. She had positioned her crotch directly over my face. She had exposed her cleavage to me on countless occasions. I can see now what she was doing. I could see she was openly hitting on me. 

 She was a bold, confident woman. She would have to be to hit on a married man without hesitation in front of his wife. 

 Was that it? 

 Was it her brazen arrogance at hitting on me that turned me on? That combined with her incredible looks and insanely perfect, sculptural, body might have done the trick. Sure, it stoked my ego to be hit on by a beautiful woman. It felt... good, you know? 

 For the first time, I realized that during the whole sordid affair, my wife had not said a thing. She had been torn apart by Alexis' vicious insults, and was left in a crying mess while Alexis came on to me. Shannon stood there, powerless, and I wasn't there to comfort her; I was paying attention to Alexis. I was more concerned with her than my crying wife. Having a personal trainer with the body of a porn star arrogantly hitting on me in front of my emotionally deflated, crying mess of a wife gave me an erection? What kind of man was I? What kind of husband was I? 

 These were the questions that had plagued me for weeks. Why did I respond the way I did? Was there some dark part of me that would respond to an evil, twisted woman like Alexis? 

 I always considered myself a good guy. But the way I had behaved during this whole thing was not how a good guy would. I should have cursed out Alexis, and saved my wife from the psychological damage Alexis wrought. Instead, I just let it happen. 

 Why? 

 Was there some part of me that agreed with Alexis? Was there some part of me that wanted her to say those things to my wife? Was there some part of me that enjoyed seeing my wife getting kicked in the ass by this confident, arrogant, hateful woman? Was there some part of me that enjoyed seeing my wife be berated? A normal man would have taken his wife and left with some dignity. Instead, I got an erection and forgot all about her. Once again, I had to ask myself. What kind of man was I? 

 I thought I was a good man. I was a teacher. I tried to shape the future; to be a positive influence on young people's lives. I tried to inspire young people to better themselves, to reach their full potential. I tried to be friendly to everyone. I tried to be a good friend. A good son. A good husband. And I had failed. 

 Was there a dark side of me emerging? I always felt bad when I lied, so I rarely ever did. I never stole. I never cheated. Was it possible I had just suppressed this dark aspect of my character for years, and it took an evil influence like Alexis to bring it out? I didn't want to be evil. I wanted to be a good guy. A good husband. I had to stay away from that evil influence. 

 I had to stay away from Alexis. 

 I was internally conflicted about all of the events of the last few weeks. I summed it up in my head. My wife had been harassed and humiliated by the woman who was supposed to help her lose weight. In doing so, my wife had put on weight. And that is not what I was thinking about. I was thinking about the trainer. The woman who made my life hell. I was terrible. 

 As you can see, I was going through a bit of an existential crisis. So I did what I always did when I needed some time to think; I worked out. I had access to the school, so I was able to get into the weight room whenever I needed. And, as always, I ran. I didn't run along my normal path. Alexis knew my path, and she was no doubt seeking me out. I doubt she had forgotten about me. 

 I mixed up where I ran. Sometimes, I would run through downtown. Sometimes, at the school. Today, I was running through the woods. It had a running path, but it didn't seem too populated, especially early in the morning. 

 I still ran first thing in the morning. The cool morning air heightened my senses. It was nice this week, because Shannon was working mornings too. I felt extremely guilty about everything that had happened in the past few weeks, so I made sure to be as good of a husband as possible. I made her breakfast and was the best husband I could possibly be. Plus, today was our anniversary, so I had to be nice. 

 Shannon was excited for the fancy dinner we had planned for later that night, and she told me she was hoping to get out from work early to enjoy dinner with her loving husband. I smiled and kissed her as she got into the car and I started on my run shortly after, my shoulders feeling stiff and heavy with guilt. 

 I was running hard; harder than usual. I had a lot on my mind. I was not used to this path, so I didn't know what to expect. If I had been used to this path, I would have kept an eye out for branches. But I was too in the zone to notice things like that. That's why, when I was making a turn, I didn't notice that large stick on the ground. And of course, I stepped on it. 

 I was running so hard that I completely wiped out. I felt my knee twist as I fell over the stick, and I felt a very familiar tear. A tear I had felt once before, on the football field, when I blew out my knee. My knee was never quite the same after that; it had taken years of physical therapy to get it back to normal, but the danger of tearing it again if I over exerted myself was always present. I slammed onto the ground, scraping up my right arm and leg. None of the scrapes bothered me. My attention went to my knee. 

 I knew immediately that I had blown out my knee. I tried stretching it out but the pain was too much. I slammed my hand against the ground in a combination of pain and anger, and I regretted it immediately. A jolt of pain shot through my arm. No injury from that bonehead move, just a bit of pain. I moved to a sitting position and I rubbed my knee, trying somehow to rub the pain away. But I knew it was pointless. The pain wasn't going away any time soon. 

 Of course I didn't bring my cell phone. I didn't carry anything when I ran except my keys, wanting to avoid any distraction. I was now regretting this decision. I tried to stand but that wasn't happening either. I felt like an idiot just sitting there, but I had no choice. I had to wait for someone to chance by to help me out. 

 I was sitting there for a good 45 minutes. I could be using this opportunity to get better acquainted with nature, appreciating my surroundings, trying to stay calm, but I was too angry for getting hurt. I just sat there, leaning against a tree on the side of the trail. Finally, in the distance, I could hear the footsteps of a runner. I didn't just want to call out. I didn't want them to think I was some crazy person, and scare my potential savior off. I figured they would have to pass me, so I waited patiently. 

 I could hear the footsteps getting closer. I looked down the trail, waiting for whoever it was to make the turn; their approach bringing them closer and closer. Finally, the person made the turn, and I had to laugh out loud in exasperation as I saw who was running towards me; the irony not lost on me. 

 'Of course,' I thought with bitter bemusement, 'Who else could it be?' 

 Alexis jogged around the corner, looked down at me, first surprised, then amused, as she quickly sized up my predicament, and she smiled predatorily, flashing her perfect white teeth, looking at me like a spider caught in her web. 

 "Well, well, well... What are the odds?" Alexis laughed, jogging to a stop in front of me, hands on her hips, towering over me haughty and superior. 

 I looked her over. Even though it was early, it was hot, and she had worked up a good sweat from her run. Her outfit was not as skimpy as some of the others she had worn, but on her it was still indecently sexy. She was wearing a top that was a glorified sports bra, and her small, stretchy shorts had a strip of material on each side that had green, white, and blue stripes. It left her flat belly and long legs exposed. She glided up to me smoothly. 

 "What happened? Are you alright?" she asked with mock concern, leaning over me, her breasts falling forward, crushed together by her arms, creating a tantalizing, teasing, valley of cleavage. Does she do stuff like this on purpose, or was it just impossible for her not to show off? 

 "Just keep walking. I don't want to deal with you right now." I snapped, turning my head to avoid getting lost in her deep cleavage, waving her off dismissively, "You've caused me enough trouble, you bitch." 

 "Oh, c'mon Ben; we can at least be cordial. Don't worry, I come in peace," Alexis said, hunkering down next to me, ignoring my insult...maybe even enjoying it, "Now, what's wrong?" 

 I paused as I decided what to do. It might be hours before someone else came along. Despite my fear of this woman, I might have to accept her help. With a deep breath, I began to speak. 

 "I blew out me knee," I told her, finally consenting to her help. 

 "Blew it out? How do you know for sure?" she asked, looking at my injured knee. 

 "Because I've done it before," I said, wincing in pain. 

 "Well, let me help you up," Alexis suggested. 

 I gave her a suspicious look, as if to tell her no funny business. She smiled again, dismissively, and leaned down. I put my arm over her shoulder, and with a bit of a struggle on my part, I tried to stand. She more then held up her end of the bargain; the strength she had gained with her constant exercise was well utilized as she helped get me to my feet without much of a struggle on her part. 

 I was a little off balance as I regained verticality, but she was there to keep me from falling, supporting my greater weight with great strength. I tried to put a little weight on my leg. It hurt, a lot, but if I absolutely had to, I could walk on it. The problem was, my knee felt so rickety, there was no doubt that if I tried to walk, I would fall over, and undoubtedly do more harm than good to myself. I had definitely torn it up bad. I needed someone with me, to keep me from falling. At this point, I needed Alexis. 

 "Well, I can take you back to my place and get you sorted out," Alexis suggested, eying me up hungrily. 

 "Noooo, no, no, no," I objected firmly, shaking my head, "We are not going to your place. We're going to mine," I stated. 

 "Mine's closer," Alexis countered. I looked at her, communicating that my mind was made up, "But, okay, you're place works for me too." 

 We began to gingerly walk together, moving slowly but surely towards the safety of my home, where I could call an ambulance. 

 "This isn't your normal route," I said to her, probingly, "Why are you here? How can you be here?" 

 "Well, I've been mixing it up," Alexis said with a knowing smile. She knew that I knew her true goal; she had been trying different routes, till she ran into me. 

 "How's Shannon doing?" she asked with only mild interest, a certain cold disinterest in her voice as she made small talk. She was despicable. 

 "You're a nasty piece of work, you know that? The things you said to her, the things you did...you could have broken up my marriage!" I spat angrily at her, gritting my teeth as I felt another electric jolt of pain run up my leg. Angry at what she had said. Angry at the internal conflict she had caused. Angry at the way she made me feel, as I relied on her, leaned on her...touched her. 

 "Did it work?" Alexis asked. 

 "Did what work?" I replied, confused, still angry. 

 "What I said. Did all the nasty things I say motivate her to lose weight and shove it in my face? Did she prove me wrong and make herself attractive to you?" Alexis said plainly. 

 I didn't say anything, trying to figure out the best way to respond. 

 "I guess that's my answer." she said with a mocking laugh, "You know, I learned in this job very early on that you can't win them all. You can't get through to some people. Some people are meant to be fit. Some are meant to be fat." 

 "Fuck you!" I snarled. I rarely cursed, but this woman deserved it. 

 "I really piss you off, don't I? Keep it up. God, you don't know what that does to me," she cooed, almost moaning in pleasure. I grit my teeth, stopping myself from saying anything more. 

 "Some women, like me, are meant to be fit and pretty. Other women, like your wife, are meant to weigh 400 pounds and scarf down donuts all day. You just need to realize that, and then this will all sort out naturally," Alexis said calmly, assuredly, with the greatest confidence. I again said nothing, having no argument worth voicing. Somehow, someway, this bitch could read me like a book; like she could see all my anxieties and fears, and intuited now to prey on them. 

 "Or maybe, you have realized it. You have come to terms with the fact that your wife is a fat ass!" Alexis chirped with self satisfaction. 

 "It doesn't matter," I growled angrily. 

 "What doesn't matter?" she asked naively, pouting, teasing me. 

 "It doesn't matter... that... it doesn't matter that my wife... it doesn't matter that my wife is fat!" I yelled at her. She bit her plump bottom lip, as if stifling pleasure. 

 "Oh, it does Ben, it really does," Alexis started. "Imagine your life in ten years. Will you really be happy fucking your fat wife? Will you be happy with the fat kids she will give you? What a waste it would be, all this fine, hard work put to waste with a fatty!" she said, admiring at my fit body openly. I felt vulnerable...naked, as she eyed me up like a hunk of prime rib. 

 "I love her. It doesn't matter that she is fat. I still love her!" I protested, repeating my argument, not so much for her benefit, but for my own, trying to reinforce my resolve. 

 "But for how much longer?" Alexis said, still guiding me down the path, "Look, if she has so little dedication to something as simple as losing weight, how much dedication can she possibly have to your marriage? Clearly not much. If she gave a shit about you, she would keep herself in-shape for her man. How arrogant can she be that her personality alone will keep you happy? You have done such fine work for her, why can't she do the same for you? That, to me, is the sign of a bad wife. I know these things. I've been right so far. Your wife is fat, like I said, and you've admitted it, after much denial. You're marriage is a fraud. She can't have the dedication to maintain a happy marriage, if she doesn't have the dedication to maintain her body for you to enjoy. Deep down, you know that too. So, why live a lie? So why not get out now, before you are in too deep, which, having seen Shannon naked, I imagine isn't more than a few inches for a girl like her. You need to get in real deep with another woman. A better woman." 

 "You're evil," I said, shaking my head incredulously, "How can you say these things? What's wrong with you?" 

 "You've always been the good guy, haven't you Ben?" she asked, ignoring me, continuing with her tirade unobstructed, "Always been a good man. A good friend. A good husband. Don't you want to bad, Ben? Don't you think you've earned it? Don't you think you deserve the chance to be selfish; to do something for you? You've put up with fat ass for so long, no one would blame you. Just look at me, Ben. Doesn't my body want to make you do nasty, dirty, filthy things?" 

 I couldn't help but gaze into her massive cleavage, the masses of her breasts rubbing together tantalizingly, temptingly, as we walked, rising and falling with her breath. I swallowed deeply. 

 "Don't you want to get at least one good feel of what I have to offer? Just once?" she offered. I stopped walking and leaned against a tree, pulling away from her in disgust. 

 "I don't have to listen to any of this," I started. We were near the edge of the forest, more likely to run into someone else, someone saner, "Just...just fuck off, Alexis. I'll get home myself." 

 "Ben, listen, don't be so stubborn," Alexis teased, pursing her plump lips in a playful pout. 

 "No. I will not just walk with you and listen to this crap!" I said defiantly...desperately. 

 "Ben, its 6:30 in the morning. I'll tell you what. You let me say my piece, and once I'm done, if you still feel the same way, I'll let you go on your own way and you'll never see me again. Just walk with me for a bit. Please?" Alexis reasoned, more calm, cool, and collected than I was. Report_Story #11 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© I thought it over for a bit. It was a tempting offer. I wanted this woman out of my life, and she was giving me a way to do that. I just had to grit my teeth and hear her out. What was the worst that could happen? They were just words. She couldn't make me do anything I didn't want to. 

 Finally, I held my arm out and she slid under it, bracing me. We resumed walking. 

 "So, I want to fuck you," Alexis said simply, matter-of-factly. I nearly choked on my own tongue as she said this. She giggled at my reaction, "And not just one of those, regular, lame, lay on my back and let you do your thing fucks that Shannon probably gives you. I want to fuck the shit out of you. I have wanted to since I first saw you." 

 "I'm honored," I said sarcastically. 

 "You should be," Alexis said. She gauged my reaction before continuing, "Have you actually thought about it? Have you actually thought about fucking me? About how good it would be?" 

 Alexis let this sink in for a bit. I hadn't actually thought about it. I hadn't thought about her in the act of sex. I hadn't thought about her fucking. Now I couldn't think about anything else. Images flashed through my head. Alexis, naked. Alexis covered with sweat. Flashes of her body. I gulped. 

 "You've seen me work out. You've seen my body in action. You know what a pure athlete I am. Imagine how good I am in the bedroom. Imagine how I can use this body to give you pleasure," Alexis said, whispering in my ear as we shuffled along. 

 Alexis was an incredible athlete. She moved with a liquid grace. No wasted motion. Everything she did was smooth. Graceful. Her hips rolled like a well oiled machine as she moved. Her body was so smooth. So firm, yet so soft in all the right places. Putting all this together in my imagination, I was had little doubt in my mind that she was a tigress in bed. 

 We were leaving the forest trail and walking down the smooth, flat, pavement of the sidewalk now, which was easier than the rough, uneven terrain of the trail. My pain was relieved slightly and there were no cars around to offer distraction, so I had choice but to pay attention to Alexis. 

 "You're a real piece of work, you know that?" I said, marveling at the depths of her depravity. I had meant it as an insult, but when the words left my mouth, I was surprised at how it sounded almost like admiration. 

 "You don't know the half of it, babe." she quipped gleefully, "You've seen my dedication in the gym. How committed I am to making my body perfect. I run, lift weights, do yoga, swim. Do you want to know why that is? Once I turned 18 and discovered sex, it became my addiction. I love it. And I love being good at it. All the work I do is to make my sex life better. To feed my addiction." 

 I said nothing, silently letting her continue her tirade unabated. 

 "Just look at yourself. I completely fucking owned your wife in every way. I made her life hell, and despite that, you still want to get in my pants," Alexis said smugly. 

 "I don't want to get in your pants!" I spat, exasperated by her insistence that I wanted to fuck her. 

 "Sure, you don't," she rolled her eyes, visibly annoyed with my resistance, "Ben, you just need to let go. Shannon doesn't deserve you. I mean, you could spend the rest of your life sticking that dick of yours in that fat tub of lard, but think of what you could have. Imagine if you just let go of whatever misplaced, ridiculous, loyalty you have to that pathetic piece of shit. Imagine the fun you could be having. You wouldn't be resting your hand on my shoulder," Alexis said, coming to a stop. She pulled away to expose her back half to my field of vision, "You would be palming my hot ass," she said, giving her ass a little swat. I couldn't help but admire the firm jiggle of her ass cheek. She spun around, pointing her massive breasts at me. 

 "Or maybe, you would be using these suckers to hold yourself up," she suggested, thrusting her firm breasts at me insistently, "Imagine, having free reign to molest these bad boys whenever you want," she cooed, lifting her head back to further point those suckers at me. Her nipples were clearly hard under her top, pushing out against the thin fabric. She cupped them and gave them a firm squeeze before continuing to lead me on. We were approaching the edge of downtown. 

 "Imagine; if you just let go of that loyalty, that outdated dedication to the misplaced ideal of the monogamous relationship, you could just throw me against a tree and just fuck the shit out of me...use me, abuse me, control me the way a man should." 

 Alexis paused, licking her full, pouting, lips invitingly, stalking closer. I could feel her body radiating heat as she got dangerously close, her hand hovering, tauntingly, over my crotch, flaunting her seductive power over me. 

 "You want to shut me up, then why don't you just do it; stuff something big and thick in my mouth to shut me up, if you're man enough," she stopped, stepping back again, "Or, whatever, go back to your wife. You could squeeze your wife's fat, saggy, butt; it's so big that it'd impossible to miss. You could probably reach it from here. And, she doesn't have much in the way of breasts either. The closest thing she has is belly fat. And I'm sure that isn't nearly as fun to squeeze as these are," she taunted, indicating her massive breasts again, "And I'm not gonna even mention her cunt. I saw it in the shower. She has one big, nasty, hairy, probably smelly, cunt. Mine's not. My cunt is nice and clean and pretty. I can show you if you want. And I would hazard a guess that that nasty thing of hers isn't exactly snug anymore. She seems the type to not care about that kind of thing. But I am," she said, before again leaning and whispering in my ear, as she took my arm and draped it around her should again, "I'm as tight as a drum." 

 Those words sent a shiver through my spine, as she hefted me up again, and we continued onward. This woman was so nasty. I looked at her and she smiled arrogantly, as if she knew, in all confidence, that she had me hooked. I had to admit, she was drop dead sexy. Every bit of her was perfect. She was gorgeous. Her boobs were huge, her ass was perfect. Her body was fit as a fiddle. 

 Most men would kill to be desired by such a sexy creature. But that's all she was; sexy. Under the superficial surface of her impossible attractiveness, she was pure evil, and that should override all other concerns; who could love such a woman? How could you have a relationship with someone like that? 

 Sure, she had an ass that was made to be touched and fondled. Sure, she had giant breasts, built for squeezing...sucking. Sure, her mouth and lips were perfect for sucking dick. Sure, she had a snug, tight pussy. And sure, she could probably fuck like a minx; she could probably ride a dick like a madwoman. And she would be nasty too. She probably had a filthy mouth when she was having sex. And her boobs probably bounced all over the place, unless I kept a firm grip on them. And she would probably use her muscular ass to flex around my big cock, tightening her pussy as she ground into my pelvis. And she would be covered in sweat. She looked so sexy when she was covered in sweat. And since she was in such great shape, she could probably go for hours. Hours of sweaty, intense sex. 

 I shook my head, freeing myself from the trap of the fantasy I'd lost myself in. How did she keep insinuating herself into my head like that? Why couldn't I stop thinking about her...fantasizing about her? 

 "It's just sex. Sex isn't everything," I told her. 

 "Spoken like someone who has never had good sex before. Trust me, as someone who is an expert in good sex; great sex, really; if you put two people together who want to have good sex, they will go at it until they run out of energy. Imagine, two people, in tip-top shape, who both want nasty sex. Imagine what would happen if two people like that met each other," Alexis teased, holding my gaze with those cold, hypnotic, grey eyes of hers. 

 We reached the street corner, and we waited for the light to change and allow us to cross. Cars would lazily pass by every so often, as people began to get their days started. As we stood, Alexis turned us towards a glass storefront. 

 "Look at us," she mused, looking at our reflection in the glass, "We look so good together. A perfect match. A fit, gorgeous couple. I bet that's what most of these people driving by think. They think me and you are a happy couple. It'd be hard not to. We are two gorgeous, sexy people. And we've got our hands all over each other. People have to think we're fucking each other. It'd be a waste if we weren't doing it." 

 I gulped again. Her fit body pressed against me. I had to admit, we did look too intimate together to not be considered a couple. And yes, I had to agree, with declining resistance, we were perfectly matched. 

 "People see you and your wife together and they think you're her trainer," Alexis said as she began to lead me across the street, "When they saw all three of all us together, they thought we were the cute trainer couple trying to train the hopelessly fat woman." 

 As we walked down the street, I again marveled at her depravity. 

 "How can you do this? How can you just trample over the sanctity of marriage like this? I love my wife!" I said, insistently, desperately, trying to convince myself as much as her. Trying to strengthen my resolve. 

 "The sanctity of marriage?" she laughed mockingly, as if I'd said something completely ridiculous; and from her perspective, from her deviant worldview, I supposed I had, "You still believe in that stuff? Listen, I'm all for getting married and being with someone, but I also believe that when someone doesn't hold up their end of the bargain, a person should feel free to jump ship. And she is not holding up her end of the bargain. What about the sanctity of a normal woman's waistline? I'm sure she was skinnier when you were dating, but once she suckered you in, she let her waistline explode! What a deceptive bitch. She can't even keep herself attractive for you. I can't believe a woman could be that undedicated to a hunk like you, that selfish and self-important." 

 Part of me unhappily admitted she had a point. I maintained my physique. But she had not. I had met her in a gym for God's sake. I figured she would keep herself healthy. I had to admit I had been a bit disappointed to find out that she only occasionally worked out. But I liked her. She was so pretty, and fun to be around. Or, at least she was. Lately, she had been a mess. She wasn't as much fun to be around. She said she wanted to lose weight, but she cheated on her diet. She complained about Alexis, but she didn't listen to her either. I had to admit Shannon's weight problems were her own fault. 

 "I'm the kind of woman you deserve. A fit, dedicated woman, who knows how to please you. A woman who can keep up with you, not wheeze and whine like Shannon probably does. A woman who will never turn you down. Who can do things that you wouldn't believe," Alexis hissed in my ear. 

 I loved Shannon, and I know she loved me. But I had seen a glimpse of her that I did not like. An insecure, undedicated, overweight mess. Maybe I had been deceived. Maybe she had been putting up a front for years, and it was finally beginning to crack. But the worst was how she had lied to me. She misled me about why her diet was failing. She said it was Alexis's fault. But I knew it was hers. The only one who had been totally honest here was Alexis. 

 That didn't mean that I was just gonna jump into Alexis's pants. I loved Shannon, but we had things we needed to work out. And the main problem being, she needed to work out. I wasn't a shallow man by any means, but I would prefer it if my wife was not putting on weight. I would prefer her to be slim. Slim and fit, like Alexis. We had to get to the bottom of her issues if we wanted our marriage to work. 

 We reached another street corner, and as we waited, I braced myself against a light post. This freed her up to stand in front of me again. 

 "Do you like my body, Ben?" Alexis asked, coyly. I looked at her, as if saying, 'Really?' I tried to be civil as I answered: 

 "You are very fit, Alexis," I said. This made her smile cutely. We were still waiting for the light to change. 

 "Oh, yeah? You like my muscles?" Alexis probed inquisitively. Even though she was very fit, she was not overly muscular. She had smooth, firm muscles, not bulging, gross muscles. I raised an eyebrow. She raised her arm up and flexed. 

 "C'mon, Ben, feel my bicep. You know you want to," She teased. She rotated her wrist around, as if posing. The light changed behind her. 

 "We should get going," I said, pointing at the light, relieved to have found a way out of this game she was playing. 

 "Not until you feel. C'mon, it's just my bicep. It's not that bad," she teased. Impatient to keep moving, I reached forward and wrapped my hand around her bicep. 

 I don't know why, but this sent a shiver through me that I had never experienced. Her muscle was much firmer than I anticipated. She was clearly very strong. I gave her bicep a few squeezes, enjoying its taut firmness. By the time I pulled away, the light had already changed. I realized my dick was hardening up, and there was no way I could hide it without her knowing what I was up to. 

 We finally crossed the street, and as we reached the next block, more people emerged on the sidewalk. She kept quiet until we reached the next block. I repeated my previous motion, leaning against a light pole. I figured since there were some people around, Alexis wouldn't try anything funny. That was a mistake. She took the opportunity to stand in front of me and press herself against me. There was no doubt that she felt my throbbing hardness between her butt cheeks. I was taken aback, but there was nothing I could do. I couldn't just walk away. She grabbed both of my arms by the wrists before I could stop her. I was caught off balance, and as she looked back at me deviously, in order to balance me, she brought both of my hands to her flat belly. 

 "It's okay to feel. I know you want to," she whispered. I was in shock. I didn't know how I ended up in this situation, feeling the fit, flat, belly of this woman I despised. But my palms were now pressed against her stomach. Her smooth, sexy stomach. I figured the damage was already done, so I couldn't help but rub my hands against her, gently but firmly caressing her taut abdominals. 

 "My belly feels good, doesn't it?" she whispered. My hands traveled up and down the full expanse of her flat belly. I traced my fingers around her waistband. 

 "Feel my abs, Ben," she whispered. As if I had no control of my own extremities, my fingers traced upwards, up her smooth, muscular stomach. The muscles in her stomach were not overwhelming enough to be gross. They were subtle, smooth, and sexy. 

 "It feels sexy, doesn't it?" she added. I circled my finger around her belly button, causing her to groan. I teased it for a second before dipping inside. I let my fingers rise further upward, across her abs, getting closer to her top. As my fingers nearly reached the fabric of her top, I looked up and realized people were watching us. 

 I pulled my hands away, as if burnt. What the hell had just happened? She brought my hands to her fit stomach, and I just went brain dead. What the hell was I doing? Feeling up her hot, sexy abs in public, surrounded by people. I was a married man! I had never really been with a super-fit girl like her, so feeling a woman's muscular stomach was a new experience. And I had to admit, I wasn't prepared for how incredible it would feel. Her stomach was so sexy! And hearing her moan in pleasure by my hands drove me wild. 

 She looked back at me, her usually cold eyes radiating with unfamiliar heat and emotion. She was clearly turned on. As thanks for the slight pleasure I gave her, she flexed her ass against my dick. My throbbing, hard, dick. The light then changed, and she got under my arm and assisted me across the street. 

 Once we got across the street, the people around us began to dissipate, and we were soon alone again. She used this opportunity to again speak her mind. 

 "I could tell how much you enjoyed that," Alexis teased, "I have to wonder where your hands would be if there had been no one else around. You might have gotten your hands under here," she flirted, lightly snapping her stretchy top. 

 She had a good point. If there was no one around, nothing could have stopped me. I would have slipped my hands into her top. I would have squeezed her large breasts, kneading and rolling them around her chest, over and over. I would have tweaked her nipples, making her moan. I would have lost all control. 

 And I would have enjoyed it. 

 "How about, at this next corner, just imagine we're a couple. Do what you would do if I was your woman. Take advantage of me, like a real man would," Alexis offered. This sounded really fucking good, and the light touching I had given her body had felt amazing. But, I just couldn't. I was married. 

 We made it to the next stoplight. There were group of people around us, but Alexis still looked at me expectantly, tapping her foot against the pavement impatiently, waiting for something. 

 "What?" I asked sheepishly, trying to avoid her stern gaze. 

 "Do it!" she hissed commandingly. 

 I hesitated. There were people right here. Plus, I had a wife! 

 With impatient anger, she grabbed my wrist off of her shoulder. I couldn't stop as she slowly brought my open palm down across her ripe ass-cheek. She dragged my palm across her cheek, from top to bottom. The firm flesh felt so good against my open hand, and my fingers squeezed lightly, pushing against her spandex covered flesh. 

 I was in a daze as she brought my hand upward, grazing across her belly once more, heading straight for her chest. Within seconds, my hand would be filled with her huge breasts. I couldn't stop her as she pressed my open palm into her breasts. Their softness felt so good! I couldn't help but give them a firm squeeze. She looked smugly back at me as I squeezed over and over again. They were amazing! I could feel her nipples in my palm. My other hand joined in on the fun, cupping and squeezing her bulging breasts. My throbbing dick ended up between her ass-cheeks again. Primal, primitive, instinct took over, and started to hump against her ass as I filled my hands with her giant tits. She moaned from deep in her throat as I molested her desirable body. My hands reached the hem of her top, ready to get my hands on her bare breasts, when someone cleared their throat next to us. 

 I realized that everyone around us was watching us almost get it on right here on a street corner. What the hell was I thinking? 

 "Sorry," Alexis said, smiling, unembarrassed, "We got a little carried away...but, really, can you blame us?" she quipped with a wink. We crossed the street before anything else could happen. 

 We started to enter the edge of my neighborhood. And more than anything I was feeling at the moment, I felt terror. Pure terror. 

 This woman terrified me in a way I had never felt. I loved my wife. Sure, she was fat, but she was so sweet, and pretty. Alexis was different. A dark, evil aura emanated from her. Looking at her made dark, nasty thoughts rise to the surface. She was gorgeous, and sexy, and voluptuous. She had a bad attitude, and she was proud of it. She was capable of spewing pure venom. But she was so hot, and her tits were so huge! She was unlike anyone I had ever met. 

 I always hung around good girls. But after being exposed to the temptations Alexis offered, part of me realized that there was some part of me that didn't want a good girl. There was a part of me that appreciated what bad girls had to offer. Part of me that went brain dead around a seductive girl like her. My inexperience with girls like this was coming back to haunt me. Only if I experienced what a girl like her could do could I understand them. Report_Story #12 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© But I had no intention of testing that theory. I needed to get away from her as soon as possible, for the sake of my marriage. I had shown myself to be incapable of fighting her off when she offered even the slightest temptation. Public exposure was no deterrent; I didn't care. I just lost myself in her, powerless. 

 I just needed to turn her away as soon as we got to my house. I could not let her in my house. That would spell doom for my marriage. 

 Luckily, we were getting close to my house. We were on the outskirts of my neighborhood. I saw some people I recognized, and they gave me a concerned look as I limped by. These bystanders kept Alexis's behavior in check, but just barely, as she kept her hand firmly on my ass as she supported my weight and helped me limp along. 

 By the time we escaped the view of any nosey passersby and gossip hounds, we were within view of my house. I guided her towards my house, and slowly but surely, we made our way there. We shambled up my front walkway and up the stairs to my patio. I leaned up against the house and she stepped away. 

 "So, I appreciate you helping me out," I said, trying to avoid any further discussion, any more of her tempting tirade, her indefensible argument. 

 "Do you need me to stick around?" she asked. 

 "No, I'll hang out here till Shannon gets home," I told her, eager to get her away. 

 "Well, do you need me to help you inside?" she asked, clearly hopeful to break the barrier and invade my home; my last sanctuary. 

 "No, I should be able to handle it," I replied. 

 "You suuuure?" she purred, boldly stepping forward. 

 "Yes, I'm sure," I said nervously, fumbling for my keys. She didn't move as she stood in front of me, and her watchful, calculating, stare made me nervous, nervous enough to cause my hands to shake, nervous enough to make me drop my keys. I started to bend over and realized I couldn't. 

 Alexis saw my predicament, and she was eager to help out. She simply spun around, put her ass against my crotch, and bent over at the waist, looking to grab the keys. My dick had just begun to finally go down, but now, it began to quickly reverse course. Once again, my mind went dead. Her ass felt so good against me. I put my hands on her hips to support myself as I leaned awkwardly into her. 

 An image flashed into my head. Me holding onto her bare hips as I drove into her, drove my dick inside of her. Us roughly fucking, in my bed. I shook this image from my head, and it was only then that I realized she had stepped away. I looked forward, and the front door was open. Alexis was standing inside my home, one hand on her hip and the other against the door. 

 I had let her in, and I knew deep down there was no getting her out. 

 "C'mon, Ben. Let me help you inside," Alexis said smugly. 

 I knew what would happen if I didn't get her out of my house. I knew it. I just looked at her. God, she was so sexy. She was ridiculously good looking, and somehow, someway, she just had me by the balls, figuratively and literally. If I let my dick make the decision, I would hop inside in an instant and join her. But I couldn't. I was married. Sure, she was the sexiest woman I had ever seen, but I couldn't cross that line. If I was single, I would have joined her, despite the fact she was pure evil. That wasn't what was stopping me. Honestly, at this point, her evilness wasn't what was stopping me. The only thing stopping me was the vows I made to my wife. 

 "I can't," I pleaded with her, a slight tremble in my voice. I felt like I was going to cry. What was wrong with me? What kind of man was I? She could see the conflict I was going through. 

 "It's okay, Ben. No one would blame you for doing this," Alexis cooed, curling her finger, coaxing me forward, inviting me to join her in my own house. She knew where this was going, too. She knew this was heading to our inevitable copulation. 

 "I'm married. I'm a good guy," I said, not moving, futilely trying to stand my ground. 

 "Here's the thing, Ben; you're not a good guy. A good guy wouldn't check out the woman that humiliated his wife. A good guy wouldn't feel her up in public. A good guy wouldn't have ended up letting me get this close. Face it, Ben, you're an asshole. You're a guy that would dump his fat wife for better pussy. You're the type of guy that demands his wife be fit. You're the guy who would dump his wife because she gained ten pounds, much less forty," Alexis said, stepping close to me. 

 "No, I'm not," I said, trying to hold on to the last shred of my dignity. I had always tried to be a good guy. I always listened to my parents. I treated everyone politely. I did good in school. I stayed away from the bad crowd. I became a teacher. All of these things were things a fine, upstanding, man would do. 

 "Ben, you've acted like the man people wanted you to be, and what has it gotten you? Can you really say you're happy? Now it's time to be the man you know you know you are. You've been running from it for years. Be a man. Do what a real man would do. A real man would dump his lard ass of a wife. A real man would shack up with the hottest bitch he can find. You know this is the truth. You're a bad boy, Ben. And the good thing is, I'm a really bad girl. That's why we're perfect for each other." Alexis said, stepping up to me and planting a soft, meaningful, kiss on my lips. 

 I couldn't move. Couldn't react. I heard a noise and looked to my right. My neighbor had just stepped outside, and she saw the kiss. In that moment, the damage was done. There was no doubt that Shannon would eventually hear about this from her. But did it matter? Would she find out anyway? I looked straight into Alexis' eyes. 

 Was I a bad guy? Her lips felt so soft, and her face looked so pretty. She was so much better looking than my wife. So fit, so naughty...she just oozed sex appeal. I had never gone after a girl based purely on sexual appeal. I thought it was the type of thing a bad guy would do. But I felt this connection with her. She knew me so well. She consumed my thoughts. I couldn't go back to Shannon after seeing this side of life. Alexis was in shape. Alexis was sexy. Alexis was exciting. Alexis was bad, and I loved that about her. The damage was done. Shannon would find out the truth from our neighbor. There was no turning back. 

 I jumped forward, my lips meeting hers, forcing us inside. Her tongue immediately forced its way into my mouth, dueling with mine, mashing into mine. Her soft lips met mine, and the sensation drove me wild. She tasted so good! 

 I didn't feel any pain as I hobbled into her arms. She helped support me as we moved inside. I heard the lock click after she slammed the door shut; I was trapped with her now...there would be no escape. 

 As I furiously made out with my wife's hot bodied personal trainer, she led me through the house, as if she knew where she was going; her slut instinct leading her to a place to lay down with me. We were nearing the bedroom. Me and Shannon's martial bed. I couldn't let her in there, could I? Wait, I was already making out with her. Wasn't that where this was all going? 

 I couldn't describe my feelings; it was all a confused bundle of contradictory emotions. I couldn't put them into words. It definitely wasn't love. I loved things about her, but I certainly didn't love her. Part of me hated this bitch. A big part of me. She had torn my life apart. She tore my marriage apart. She had humiliated and emotionally abused my wife. She was emotionally blackmailing me, manipulating me, controlling me. I wanted her to feel the pain she made me feel. I spun her and slammed her into the wall. She groaned, not in pain, but in pleasure. Her kisses were more forceful, as if to say, 'You want it rough, you'll get it rough.' 

 She bit at my lips, digging in with her teeth, almost breaking the skin, matching the pain I had caused her. But this didn't stop me. I kept making out with her. Yes, I fucking hated this woman. She was without a doubt the most evil person I had ever met. But she had huge tits! She had a nice round ass, built for sex. She was in perfect shape. She was built to fuck. I hated her, but her incredible sex appeal drove me insane. I couldn't stop the inevitable. She had me by the balls. 

 She forced me into the bedroom, still attached to me at the lips. She spun me around and threw me down onto the bed. She tossed her hair back and looked down at me, like a wild tigress. 

 "I knew you were a sick fuck...just...like...me," Alexis said, punctuating each work with a kiss along my neck, "You're gonna fuck me. What a good husband you are...cheating on your fat wife with me. Cheating on her with me simply because I'm fit and gorgeous and have huge tits. You really hate fat women, don't you?" 

 

 "No, it's just..." I stammered, sitting up. 

 "Don't lie to me!" Alexis yelled, her eyes wild, "Tell me the truth!" 

 "I...I just..." I stuttered. She saw my apprehension. 

 Pushing me back down, she straddled me, pinning me helplessly to the bed and started to play with the bottom of her top, teasing me with the possibility of seeing the contents of her bra, finally. She lifted it partially, letting the bottom of her boobs appear, quivering, threatening to fall from her bra, teasing me. I looked her in the eyes. 

 "I hate fat women!" I cried, caving in to her, desperate with need, "Fine, you happy now!? I hate fat women, especially one's with no tits." 

 "You tried to act like one of those good, progressive guys that act like looks don't matter; but they do, don't they?" Alexis asked, demandingly. 

 "Yes," I exhaled heavily, my cock throbbing painfully, desperate for attention. 

 "Not only do they matter, you're the type of guy where looks are the only things that matter; right? You don't really care about personality. The only thing you want in a woman is a hottie with big boobs and a perfect ass; not to mention perfectly fit, not a pound of fat. What a shallow asshole you really are! Only assholes like you don't care what kind of person a woman is. You know what I am. You know how evil I am, but you still want me, you sick fuck. Don't you?" Alexis ranted, grinding her sopping crotch against mine, "Don't you!?!" 

 "Yes, I want you," I said, desperately. I was rock hard and throbbing, harder than I had ever been. Shannon had never made me feel this way. 

 "Why do you want me?" Alexis demanded. 

 "Because you're so freaking hot!" I whimpered helplessly; why was she torturing me? Why didn't she just fuck me already!?! 

 "Do you like my body?" she asked. 

 "Yes, you're body is amazing!" I admitted. 

 "You think I'm sexy?" she chirped cutely. 

 "Yes, you are so sexy," I told her, desperate for her. 

 "Sexier than your fat wife?" she asked slyly. 

 "Yes! You are so much hotter than my fat wife!" I moaned. Alexis increased her insistent pace of her grinding against my throbbing, steel hard, dick. 

 "This is your marital bed. This a bed meant for love and soul-mates and all that bullshit. I will tell you one thing: What's about to happen here will have nothing to do with love," Alexis said, dismounting and sliding back like some kind of sexy serpent, her chest briefly brushing against my crotch, making me groan out in hunger. She got on her knees at the end of the bed, between my knees. She reached up and grabbed the hem of my shorts. 

 "No, this has nothing to do with love," she started as she began to pull down my shorts, "This is about two sexy, well-built people doing what comes natura- HOLY SHIT!" she exclaimed as my dick sprang forth from my shorts, nearly slapping her chin. I humbly admit that I was larger than most, at a thick 10 inches. It had never been used to its full potential...until now. A thick, viscous, droplet of pre-cum formed on the tip. 

 "You see, Ben, we're a perfect match. Huge dick, huge tits. We're meant to be together," she mumbled, eyeing my dripping my cock as she removed my shorts from me and tossed them away dismissively. I groaned as she brushed my injured knee, "Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Good news, though, I am fully capable of putting you through physical therapy for that injured knee of yours. Don't worry, I'll take really good care of you." 

 She ran her hands up my legs, towards my pride and joy. 

 "You should be proud, Ben. This is the biggest cock I have ever seen, by far, and I have seen plenty of cocks in my day..." she added with admiration, emphasizing her slut-hood, further showing why I totally shouldn't be doing this. Then her fingers wrapped around the base of my cock. 

 She kept one hand on the base to steady my towering shaft as she used the other to stroke the entire length of my cock. 

 "Shannon never knew what to do with this, did she?" Alexis asked, moving closer to the tip, never taking her eyes off the shining droplet of pre-cum, watching it with great interest. 

 "No," I said, delirious with pleasure. 

 "No...she's far too fat to be good at sex," Alexis giggled, before she became serious again, "It doesn't matter, this dick belongs to me now anyway." 

 With that, she opened her mouth and slowly moved towards the tip. I watched in rapt anticipation as she got closer and closer, but she never quite got there. The tip of my dick never broke the barrier of her open mouth. I then watched as her warm mouth surrounded the tip of my cock, but never touched it. Just teasing it, feeling her warm breath. 

 "Oh, c'mon!" I yelled, desperate for her to start sucking. She continued stroking my cock, and the thick drop of pre-cum fell from it onto her tongue. I watched as this happened, and I watched as her eyes lidded over, as she moaned deeply, like a cat with catnip, savoring the taste of my sex. Finally, her warm wet mouth made contact with my cock as she clamped down on it and began to suck. Hard! 

 "Holy shit!" I moaned. I watched as her cheeks hollowed as she inhaled my large dick, burying it in her tight throat. I fell back onto the bed. She went up and down on my dick with no struggle. She was a true expert. A real slut. She removed my spit covered dick from her mouth to speak her mind. 

 "I bet your wife is out somewhere, filling her gullet with who knows what. I hope she gets bigger and fatter and nastier, making herself gross to her husband, so gross that he has to fill my throat with his giant cock." 

 *********** 

 (Shannon) 

 I knew I shouldn't have more than one, but these donuts my co-manager brought in were really good. 

 *********** 

 (Ben) 

 Alexis's mouth felt amazing. It was as if she was milking my cock with her throat. I might hate her, but this woman could suck a dick! Her soft lips pressed against the base of my dick as she buried my entire length in her throat with little effort. 

 "Holy shit, Alexis..." I moaned out. My balls were boiling. The end was near. I looked down, and her eyes were looking right back at me. 

 "Lexy, I'm getting close," I groaned. I could see her smile at my newfound familiarity with her, calling her by the cute nickname she'd insisted I use when we first met. She pulled back so only the tip was in her mouth. She played with the sensitive spot under the tip with her tongue. 

 "Fuck, Lexy...oh, FUCK! Here it comes!" I screamed. 

 Alexis did not budge. She kept the tip in her warm mouth as my cock began to spew hot cum; I could feel my balls clenching as I shot stream after stream of cum into her oral cavity; it was almost painful. I could feel her stirring my cum around her mouth with her tongue as she savored the taste, her eyes rolling back in pleasure as she unleashed a deep, rumbling moan of satisfaction. 

 Alexis finally released my dick and it fell out of her mouth just as the finally stream dribbled out onto her tongue, finally spent. It was as if she knew exactly how hard I would cum. 

 Alexis stood up proudly, leaned her head back, and deftly swallowed my load. 

 "Aaaaaaaaah, my secret to success," Alexis moaned, as if intoxicated on my jizz, "I think that is why Shannon kept putting on weight. You didn't give her enough warm protein injections. I can't blame you. But I'm the type of girl that gets plenty, and it shows," Alexis posed, flexing her lean biceps for my benefit, chest thrust out, stomach clenched, showing off her perfect body once more. 

 "Well, I think it's time to take these stuffy clothes off, don't you think?" Alexis said, teasing the hem of her top again. I simply nodded, wide eyed in anticipation, "But just so you know, if you want to see the goods, you have to return the favor I just gave you." 

 "Fine, whatever, just...please," I begged. Alexis smiled smugly; she knew she had me. 

 "Good, because I really want you to lick my sweaty ass crack," she said as she moved to take her top off. 

 "W-what? I thought you meant..." I stuttered. 

 I had gone down on women before; a few girls before I met Shannon, and occasionally on Shannon. Truth be told, she wasn't really into it that much...thought it was dirty and embarrassing, but she'd consent on occasion because she knew I loved it...I loved to make a woman feel good. It filled me with pride to know that I could give as good as I got...made me feel like a man to be able to make a woman scream and beg for more with my practiced tongue; but ass play? I'd never even entertained the thought before, and now Alexis seemed to expect it...this was all moving so fast; I could barely keep up. 

 "My pussy? You can do that too, but I really want your tongue on my ass," Alexis said plainly...commandingly, "Is that a problem?" 

 I thought for a second. That was gross, wasn't it? But it didn't matter...I would do anything to see her hot body in the buff at that moment. Anything. 

 "No. No problem." I said. 

 "Good," she chirped happily. 

 I watched as Alexis grabbed the bottom of her top and pulled it upward. Her big tits were dragged up by the tight fabric until they became too heavy to support, and bounced out with a meaty slap against her chest; and there they were, in all their naked glory; her humongous, incredible, jutting titties. And they were unbelievable. Holy shit...I don't know how she got those suckers packed into her tight top, but they appeared bigger than I imagined they would be. They rode high and firm on her chest, hard nipples pointing outward, erect with excitement and anticipation. Her tanned flesh was even and smooth, a healthy looking golden brown, making her look even sexier. She tossed her top aside and ran her fingers along the hem of her shorts. With a quick yank, she tugged them down her legs and stepped out of them. She stood up straight, revealing her incredible form, finally exposed to my critical eye. 

 Her pussy was beautiful. It looked like the ideal type of vagina, with only a thin strip of hair, neat, clean, and well groomed. I definitely preferred this as opposed to hairy pussies. Being nude made her legs look longer and sexier. Her gorgeous face, which led to her jutting breasts, which led down to her flat, sexy belly, which led down to her nice pretty pussy, which led to her long, sexy legs. She spun around, and showed off her perfect, heart-shaped ass to me; two firm, perfectly round, cheeks. This woman had it all. 

 She jumped onto the bed and lay down next to me, her tits bouncing around her chest heavily. As she did this, I tossed off my shirt. She reached over and rubbed her hand across my abs, purring in approval. She rolled onto her back and hooked her legs under her elbows, exposing her pussy and ass to me. 

 "Go on," Alexis commanded insistently, "I had a nice, long run this morning. I built up quite a sweat. I've really needed this," she added. 

 I stared at Alexis's ass crack, the part she was demanding me to lick. Since it was a hot one today, she was still covered in sweat, including her ass. I had never been into ass-stuff, but I had promised her that I would, and for all the wrong I'd done today, I was still an honest man, and would never break a promise made. Report_Story #13 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© "Hurry the fuck up! Don't make me sit on your fucking face!" Alexis hissed threateningly. I rolled and moved to within inches of her ass. 

 'At least it looked clean,' I thought to myself. 

 I opened my mouth, and extended my tongue. She looked down at me with patient interest, to see if I had the nerve to go through with it. I figured it was best to just get it over with, so I jumped forward, burying my tongue in her ass-crack, at the part where her ass meets her back. I gave the entire length of ass crack, including her tight asshole, a long, juicy lick, finally meeting her approving stare as I reached the top. 

 "There you go, baby. Savor it. Take it all in," Alexis purred, running her fingers through my hair, like I was her new pet. I had been terrified of my tongue touching her asshole, but I knew that was what she wanted. And honestly, it wasn't that bad. The naughtiness of doing it was kinda thrilling; I felt a rush of endorphins filling me with anxious excitement. I repeated this motion, again and again, replacing the sweat on her ass with my saliva. Soon her ass was soaked with it, and the juices dripping from her soaked vagina. 

 "C'mon, baby, really dig in there," Alexis begged, playing with her tits now, throwing her head back in ecstasy, as she mashed her big boobs together and enjoyed my subservient ministrations to her sopping ass crack. I moved my tongue till it hovered over her asshole. I hardened my tongue and stabbed it at her. 

 "HOLY SHIT!" she screamed in pleasure. I stabbed my tongue into her, trying to breach the defenses of the puckered ring of her anus. Alexis was a hard-body, and on top of that, she was extremely high-strung, so you can imagine how tight this bitch's asshole was. 

 After minutes of effort, my tongue breached her defenses and finally made it past her unyielding asshole. Her clenching asshole was painful around my tongue, but this wasn't about my pleasure. 

 "Oh yeah, keep doing it," Alexis pleaded. I continued stabbing at her asshole with my tongue, occasionally pausing to rim her. I did not hate this as much as I thought I would; actually I was starting to enjoy it, and I could see myself doing this in the future. I was slowly teasing and rimming her when she pleaded: 

 "Put your mouth on my cunt, Ben...please!" 

 I brought my mouth away from her surprisingly tasty ass to the warm confines of her soaked cunt. She was leaking copious amounts of vaginal juice, the aroma thick and heady, intoxicating, so as my tongue met her hole, my mouth filled with her juices. I dug deep into her, causing her to scratch my head roughly. 

 "Oh, you fucking asshole! Keep tonguing my cunt. Keep doing it. Show much how hotter I am than your wife by sucking my cunt instead of hers!" Alexis cried out, manic and shrill, as she ground her sopping pussy into my face. 

 I tongued her juicy cunt, and started to nibble at her hard clit. 

 "SHIT!" she screamed, eyes shut tight, face screwed up in ecstasy. 

 I alternated between her cunt and her clit, and as my cheeks hollowed out, trying to suck in juices from deep within her cunt, I felt her strong legs wrap roughly around my head. Her back arched upward, and as I felt her powerful thighs nearly crush my skull, I was suddenly engulfed in a warm spray of liquid from her cunt. I was caught off guard by this, and if I didn't swallow, I would have surely drowned. What a way to go that would have been! 

 After several swallows of her juices, whatever was left inside her trickled out. Her crushing thighs finally relented, and I gasped for air as I looked up at her. I looked up past her mountainous peaks as she wiped the sweat from her brow. 

 "I probably should have told you I was a squirter," Alexis giggled. She spread her legs and motioned for me to come forward. I crawled forward, and as I traveled up her body, I pushed my tongue against her. I started at her clit, and let my tongue travel upward, up to her belly button. She groaned as I tongued it for a few moments. My tongue traveled across her firm abs, tracing her chiseled musculature. Her tits eclipsed my vision, so my tongue traveled up against her soft, massive breast, trailing up to her rubbery nipple. 

 I let my mouth surround her nipple, taking her entire perfectly round areola into my mouth. It felt so good...so right. My cheeks hollowed as I began to suck on her tasty left nipple. She looked down at me as she let me do my thing on her tits. My hands traveled up her stomach, feeling her firm abs, before following the same trail my tongue did, going from her abs to her juicy tits. I let them overfill my hands, and the sensation of her flesh pouring through my fingers felt amazing. And when I squeezed them, the feeling was indescribable. I could tell she liked it, because I felt her nipple get even harder in my mouth. That's why I kept doing it. I couldn't get enough of her incredible breasts, and I couldn't stop my hands from squeezing over and over again. I licked all over her breast, till it was covered in my saliva, and then I let my tongue trial over to her other breast and repeated my actions. 

 I spent a long time on her breast, losing myself in my worship of their perfection, pleasuring her, before she reached down and cupped my chin. 

 "Up here baby," she cooed. 

 I moved upward, keeping my tongue on her flesh, from her chest, to her neck, to her jaw, across her soft lips, and into her open mouth. We proceeded to make out again. She showed no apprehension at tasting her pussy or ass on my tongue. She had no fear. She would do anything. She was a true whore. 

 My dick was throbbing again. I had never had a marathon sex-session before, but this was shaping up to be one. Shannon was usually one-and-done, but Alexis, she was in such good shape, I bet she could go all day...and possibly long into the night. 

 My dick was pressing against the outside of her soaked cunt. She reached down and grabbed it in her firm hand, and she pointed right at the entrance to her vagina. I pulled away from her sucking mouth. 

 "Should I put on a condom or something?" I asked sincerely. 

 She laughed. 

 "Of course not, baby. I'm not your wife. I don't want anything in the way of that fat cock and my sweet pussy," Alexis said soothingly, stroking my face tenderly. 

 Reassured, I began to push, but her vagina was tight; unyielding. I dug in to really push away at her, and then a shooting pain shot up my leg. 

 "Ow, dammit!" I yelled out, reaching down to clutch at my knee. I tried rubbing the pain away, but as I did so, Alexis rolled us both over and she landed on top, pinning me to the bed, now in control of the situation. 

 "Don't worry baby. I'll make you forget all about the pain. Let me do all the work," she purred, putting both of her hands on my chest, squeezing my bulging muscles. 

 As she molested my chest, I reached up to return the favor, cupping her bouncing breasts as she lifted herself, aiming her tight little pussy at my proudly erect cock, and started to sit on it. I watched as a bead of cum that was on the tip of my dick was forced inside her, slowly but surely. 

 "Holy shit, Lexy!" I grunted, marveling at her tightness. It felt like I was forcing my 10-inch cock through a pinhole. 

 "You like that shit! It's not like it is with your fat wife! She ain't tight like this, is she?" Alexis asked, continuing to lower herself. She was working up a sweat, as my cock fitting inside her tight cunt was no easy task. 

 "No, she's not this fucking tight!" I cried, almost crying in the pleasure of feeling her warm, wet, vagina around my throbbing meat. 

 "Tell me how loose she is!" Alexis begged, scrunched up in concentration, trying to find a way to fit my dick inside her. I had never felt a cunt this tight. 

 "I barely feel her! My dick just slips right in," I told her honestly. I found I could make no more excuses for Shannon; no longer cared to preserve her feelings...all loyalties to my wife vanished into the tightly clasping cavern of Alexis perfect cunt. 

 "Uh, oh fuck! That's got to be pretty loose for a fat cock like yours to slide in so easily," Alexis moaned. I could feel a fresh batch of her juices soaking my dick, her body desperate to have my cock inside her. My cock was somehow three quarters of the way into her. She was struggling to get the rest of it in, so she reached to my shoulders, dug in with her nails, and flexed her hips as hard as she could. That did the trick. 

 "Holy shit!" I screamed. 

 "Oh, fuck, that's fucking big!" Alexis cried, in a mix of pain and pleasure, as my cock was finally buried to the root in the tightly gripping vise of her pussy. Her firm ass was now resting on my big balls. 

 The pleasure of her snug, gorgeous pussy on my dick was incredible. All I could imagine was that bead of cum that was on the tip of my cock now deep inside her, in her womb, mixing with her eggs. The thought made me shiver. 

 "I've fucked a lot of cocks in my day, I mean a lot, and I have never had a cock this fucking big inside me," Alexis moaned out in abject admiration. She fell forward onto my chest, squashing her breasts on my chest as her mouth met mine again. I felt her cunt massaging, tightening against me, accommodating her pussy around my cock. She pulled her soft mouth away from me and brought her mouth to my ear. 

 "I gotta get used to this fat thing," she whispered, soaking my cock in her oozing juices, her cunt muscles getting used to me, before she brought her lips back to mine. This is where we stayed for what felt like a lifetime, her cunt massaging my cock as she mashed her tongue against mine, her soft boobs ballooned against my chest, her diamond hard nipples flicking against my own. I reached my hands down her sexy, sweaty back. I finally grabbed two handfuls of her ripe, 10 out of 10, ass. The ass that she had been flaunting in front of me for weeks. The ass that she loved to cover in tight stretchy material. The ass that bounced and jiggled when she walked. The ass that she made me eat minutes earlier. I squeezed her ass, again and again, and as she raised her ass from my hips, I held on tight, knowing some nasty sex was imminent. 

 She was struggling to lift herself, as my swollen dick filled her to the brim to the point that my dick was almost stuck inside her. She went in small bounces, and eventually, my dick started to slide in and out, thanks to her copious juices. Her bounces went from small, inch or two bounces, to bounces traveling half my length, but eventually, she was able to bounce from the balls to the tip. She pushed herself up, putting her hands back onto my chest, flexing her hips, using her amazing body to fuck me into submission. 

 "Shannon never fucked you like this, did she?" Alexis asked, working up a sweat. 

 "No, she never fucked me like this. She couldn't," I replied. 

 "She's too fat to ride you like this. She would be out of breath in a minute. And she'd probably crush you with her fat ass!" Alexis laughed disparagingly. 

 "She never fucked me. I had to do my thing on top of her," I told her honestly. Looking back on my so called 'sex life' with my fat fucking wife, I realized that I'd never truly fucked anyone before, never felt such excitement and satisfaction. I'd just gone through the motions, doing what I thought needed to be done, but never truly enjoying it myself. Giving and never getting in return. Until now. 

 "Poor baby...she made you do all the work. Don't worry. I like to be in control of my fuck sessions. You don't have to ruffle a hair on your pretty little head. Just let me do the work, let me make the decisions about how we'll fuck, just do what I tell you to, and if you can keep up, we'll have a very happy future together," Alexis said, fucking me in my marital bed, proclaiming a future together. She wanted this to be a future thing. She wanted us to be together. She proclaimed that if I could fuck her good enough, we would be together, because that's all that mattered to her. Fucking. And it was starting to seem like, that was all that mattered to me as well. 

 Once my cock had dug out enough room in her vagina, she was able to start bouncing at a serious pace. The feeling of her tight cunt milking me for all my cum was incredible. The feeling of her ass thumping against my hips was indescribable. This was real fucking. This was real sex. This is what I had been missing out on in my years of marriage. I had never had real sex, but now I was, and it might be impossible for me to just give this up. There was no way I could go back to what I had had before. 

 I watched her belly flexing as she fucked me, and I realized this was her secret to a perfect body. This was how she stayed in shape. Hours and hours of intense fucking gave her the body she had today, and the stamina to endure it. And for her to have such a perfect body, she must have done enough fucking to make a hooker blush. Alexis must be a real whore. 

 This revelation didn't slow me down; knowing the woman on top of me had probably had a lot of men's dicks inside of her. Alexis was definitely a bad girl. For some reason, this turned me on. This drove me wild, knowing I was fucking this whore instead of my sweet, virtuous wife. A good guy wouldn't feel this way. Only a bad guy would. I now knew the truth. 

 I was a bad guy. 

 I grabbed her hips and fucked her back, making the fuck harder, bucking my hips roughly into hers, really beating that pussy up. I was feeling no pain, only pleasure. 

 "Oh God, I'm getting close baby," Alexis moaned out, rubbing her clit as we fucked. 

 "Me too," I grunted. 

 "This dick belongs to me now, not your fat wife. Tell me! Tell me that dick is mine! Tell me how fat your wife is. TELL ME!!!" Alexis commanded, screaming at the top of her lungs, sweat pouring from her brow, a thin, glistening sheen on her massive breasts. 

 "This dick is yours! You've earned it! It belongs to you now! My wife lost all claim to it. My dick doesn't belong to her anymore. She got fat, and bloated, and obese, and she lost all right to get fucked by me anymore. You stole it from her. My cock is yours!" I cried out, feeling that climax was fast approaching. 

 "OHHHH FUCK BEN! FUCK ME! MAKE ME YOUR WOMAN! I'M CUMMING! KEEP FUCKING ME! OHHH YES! YES! YES!" Alexis screamed maniacally. Her cunt was clamping down on my cock as she came, and that drove me over the edge. 

 "FUCK, LEXY! FUCK, I FUCKING LOVE YOU!" I screamed as my dick started to pump what felt like gallons of warm semen into Alexis no doubt fertile pussy. We were cumming together, like perfectly matched lovers. In the middle of our mutual orgasms, I felt a flood of liquid shoot out of her, evidence of so hard she was cumming. My torso was covered with our combined juices as Alexis flooded my marital bed with a torrent of her sweet pussy juice. 

 She fell on top of me as our genitals quivered against each other as our orgasms finished. We lay in silence as we caught our breath from the most intense workout either of us had ever gone through. Alexis lay her head on my chest, listening to the steady pound of my fast beating heart. I put my hand on her head, running it through her hair. To an onlooker, we looked the part of a happy couple. After a few minutes, she turned her head and rested her chin on my chest. 

 "You love me, huh?" she said cutely, "That's pretty big thing to say after one bout of crazy, intense, nasty sex. But, I need to know that you are up for anything if you want to be my boyfriend. I've had lots of fuck buddy's, very few boyfriends. So I need to know you are man enough to fuck my ass. I need to know you can handle it. Cause, if you can, me and you are in it for the long haul." 

 "The question is, can you handle my big cock up your ass?" I replied, this time I was the one with the sly, knowing, grin, "You had so much trouble getting it in your little cunt, I have serious doubts you could get it up your tight little ass. So I have to ask, can you handle it?" I asked. 

 Alexis looked down at me in joy, clearly loving seeing this side of me. 

 "Can you? Bitch!" I challenged. 

 Alexis smiled evilly and lifted her cunt off my cock. My once again throbbing cock. This woman knew how to get me going. She grabbed my freshly emerged cock, still soaking with our combined juices, and pointed it directly at her asshole. Her cunt was still dripping a combo of her juices and my sperm. She had never looked sexier, and the effect on my half hard cock was immediate, as it swelled back to throbbing erectness. 

 I felt my cock-head rest against her asshole. I pushed upward, and she pushed down. I had a lot of trouble getting my tongue inside her ass, so I had serious doubts that she could get my giant dick inside her. I looked up at her and shook my head. 

 "I don't think you can do it," I said, taunting her. 

 Alexis looked down at me, as if I was challenging her. And the look that she gave me said, "Challenge accepted."

 (Shannon) 

 As I left work, my mind was on my husband. I was looking forward to tonight, as we usually had fun on our anniversary, but something seemed...off. 

 Ben had been acting strangely, ever since the whole thing with Alexis. I don't know why. I mean, he said all the right things, but he didn't seem right. It couldn't have been my weight. I'm happy to report that, with some hard work and dedication, I had managed to lose almost all the weight I had gained during my time with Alexis over the last month. After all those awful things she said to me, I had used it as motivation to join a different gym, work on my own, and shave those extra pounds off. I never expected to be a skinny girl like Alexis, but I figured if I got down to the weight I started it, and hovered there, I would be fine. Ben had always been happy with me the way I was, so I figured, why mess with a good thing. I allowed myself some cheats, but I always planned to exercise really hard to make up for it. 

 But Ben had been distant. I hoped it wasn't because of what Alexis had said. Every time I thought about her, my blood boiled, and I felt a deep pit in my stomach...and I had to eat something; and that made me even angrier. I hated that she still had that much power over me. I considered myself an easygoing kind of girl, but that bitch made my blood boil. I had to stay away from that gym, because I just knew that if I saw her again, I would kick her ass. 

 I had taken off early, hoping to surprise Ben so we could spend most of our anniversary together. As soon as I got inside, I could sense something was off. The first thing that hit me was the smell. It was a smell that could only be one thing: Sex. I was smelling the scents of sex. I got worried immediately. 

 Then I heard the sounds. The sounds of our bed, bouncing up and down, the headboard slamming against the wall. I gulped deeply as I reached the open bedroom door. I almost fell down as I saw the horror that lie waiting for me. 

 On my bed, my marital bed, I saw my husband, naked covered in sweat, as a woman furiously rode his cock. Up and down, she bounced on his cock, burying it in... her ass! 

 This bitch had my husband's 10-inch cock completely buried in her asshole! That was sick! But judging by their loud grunts and groans, they loved it. Then the woman tossed her head back, and I saw who she was, and when I did, I fell against the wall, slowly sliding down it as the strength left my legs. 

 It was Alexis. Alexis Winters, my cunt of a personal trainer, was fucking my husband...in my bed! She was furiously riding my husband's dick in her ass! How could he? He saw what she did. He saw who she was, but he still fucked her. How? 

 Alexis looked right at me, acknowledging my existence. As she did, Ben called out. 

 "Fuck! Your ass feels amazing! I didn't think you could do it!" Ben moaned in obvious pleasure. 

 "I told you baby," she said, looking at me, her cold eyes glaring into my soul, holding my gaze, forcing me to watch, unable to turn away, "Baby listen, we have a special guest." Report_Story #14 

 

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© Ben looked up, and he slowed down when he saw me, but he didn't stop. Alexis addressed me. 

 "I told you this would happen, Shannon. I told you that if you didn't lose weight, your husband would get some better pussy elsewhere. And lucky for him and me, he chose mine," Alexis cackled maliciously. 

 "H-how could you?" I pleaded with Ben, tears burning my cheeks. 

 "Look at me, Shan," Alexis started, "Can you blame him?" 

 "But you're a bitch. You're a cunt!" I screamed at Alexis. I looked at her body. Her huge breasts. Her perfect ass. Her slim frame. 

 I hated her...envied her. 

 "All true, but the thing I'm not...is fat. And baby, that's all your husband cares about. He might as well get a tattoo on his chest that says 'no fat chicks', because he ain't going back," Alexis said, looking over her shoulder at Ben for confirmation, "Isn't that right, babe?" 

 "Whatever you say, honey!" Ben moaned out. 

 "Tell her the truth, Ben, tell her why you're leaving her for good," Alexis purred, thrusting with greater enthusiasm in time with Ben's pounding thrusts. 

 "Shannon," Ben spoke to me, his voice level and serious, addressing me for the first time as Alexis continued to fuck him, "Alexis was right. She was always right. You're fat! Always have been and now I know that you always will be!" 

 I burst into tears. 

 "I did my best!" I sobbed pathetically, "You always said you were happy." 

 "I wasn't. But I am now," Ben said plainly, focusing on pounding Alexis perfect ass rather than me. 

 "But...she's evil!" I pleaded, hoping to break him out of Alexis spell somehow. Hoping to appeal to the good man I knew him to be. 

 It proved futile. 

 "Good. Because so am I," Ben quipped happily, like an angel fallen from grace. He was always such a good man; I know there was good in him. Alexis had done this to him. Alexis had corrupted him. 

 "You fucking bitch! You did this to him!" I said accusingly. 

 Alexis smiled evilly, flashing her perfect white teeth in that predatory smile of hers. I felt a chill run down my spine. 

 "You want to know how far gone he is now, Shannon. I have to make a confession, Shan. Those pills I gave you? They were weight gain pills. I wanted you to get fatter. I humiliated you. Made fun of you. All of that, so you would get fatter. Once I saw your man, I knew I had to have him. I did everything I could to make you even more unattractive; to bring your true self to the surface. I showed my body to you, showing you how ugly you truly are by comparison to my perfect beauty. I knew it would drive you to depression. I knew it would make you eat. I wanted you to get so fat your man had no choice but to stray. I wanted to make you so fat your husband realized her hated fat women. I wanted to make so fat your husband would find a fit woman to fuck. A fit woman like me. I did all this, I made your life hell, simply so that I could fuck your husband. Isn't that hot Ben?" Alexis asked Ben, seeking affirmation, while holding my gaze with those hypnotic, cold grey eyes of hers. 

 What? She had made me gain weight? She wanted to get me fat? Fucking Bitch! 

 "Holy fuck!" Ben screamed, grabbing her hips and fucking her ass harder, the rhythmic slapping of his hips against her round ass becoming louder and more insistent. That turned him on! That's sick! That would never have turned the Ben I know on. That Ben was gone, replaced by this cursing, rutting, fucking animal I see here. 

 I knew my husband was lost, thanks to Alexis. I was near catatonic as I watched the man I loved and this woman I hated fuck the shit out of each other. I watched as they got close to their climaxes, and I watched my husband's balls flex as he shot his seed deep into her hot ass. I watched as this bitch squirted her juices all over my man's abs. I watched them collapse together, lying peacefully on my bed, enjoying the post-coital glow, cuddling together...like a couple. 

 I watched Alexis lift her head and look at me. 

 "Don't worry, Shan. I'll take good care of him for you. He's in good hands...now," Alexis purred, mocking me...taunting me, as she caressed Ben's broad chest possessively. 

 "F-fuck you!" I whimpered, near defeated. 

 "Go get fat somewhere else, bitch! Leave your man with me. Go! Now...I'm done with you," Alexis ordered, waving her hand, shooing me way. 

 I had to fight back. I had to. Even if I couldn't get Ben back, I couldn't just meekly walk out on my own life! I couldn't let this lie without some kind of repercussions. 

 I got up ran, ran towards that bitch, and used the training she gave and gave one knockout swing, giving everything I had. Unfortunately, she swiveled her body like a snake, dodging the blow. She grabbed my wrist and violently torqued my arm behind me, nearly breaking it as she applied painful pressure. She pinned my arm behind me with the same hold she had used during our ill advised sparring match, pinning me to the bed, rendering me motionless...helpless. This bitch had kicked my ass while my husband's dick was up hers. 

 "I was ready to call it a day, bitch! But I think I have one more in me, do you baby?" she asked Ben. He nodded. She lifted her ass off his still hard cock and sat her cunt right on it. 

 "I want you to watch, bitch. I think this one will be something special. You're about to witness a conception, you fat fuck!" Alexis hissed in my ear. Ben looked up at her in surprise. 

 "I never wanted kids, Ben. Never saw the need. Never wanted to mess with my figure." Alexis started. "But I just realized, with the amount of fucking we're gonna be doing, it's bound to happen. Do you want that Ben? Do you want to have the children that were meant for Shannon deep in my belly instead? Are you imagining my fit, firm, stomach thrust out, taut with children? Do you want that? Cause now I do. And knowing that I'll have the children that Shannon always wanted makes me want it all the more." 

 "YES! FUCK YES I WANT YOU TO HAVE MY BABIES!" Ben moaned loudly. 

 "You'd rather have perfect children with me than having fat kids with your fat wife?" Alexis asked. 

 "YES!" Ben screamed. 

 "It's probably for the best Shan. I don't think you're heart could handle pregnancy. And even if you could, I give it 15 years tops, before that overworked heart of yours gives out. So can you blame him for choosing a sure lifetime with me and his children? Can you blame him for not wanting to follow you around when you're riding a scooter, weighing 400 pounds, buying donuts for you and your fat children, waiting for you to be out of the picture so he can start getting some real pussy?" Alexis said. 

 "FUCK ME! PLEASE!" Ben groaned. 

 With one hand on my wrist and another on my husband's chest, she began to fuck herself on Ben's cock. My head was pinned to the bed as I watched my man reach up and squeeze this bitch's giant titties. I watched them both work up a sweat. And the scent of their fucking was overpowering. It was a smell that buried itself in my brain. 

 "Oh, I love it!" Alexis moaned in my ear. 

 Ben thrust into Alexis with insistent need, a loud, rhythmic, slapping of pelvis against ass once again filling the air, as I was held prostate by my hateful tormentor, as she enjoyed the orgasmic sensation of my husband's enormous rod plowing deep into her no doubt fertile womb. I tried futilely to struggle free, but could get no leverage, and Alexis would easily subdue me with an expert application of pressure, causing me intense pain. 

 The physical pain paled in comparison to the psychological trauma of being forced to join in with my husband's extra-marital activities, made worse by Alexis joyful groans and moans, her plump, perfect, lips placed against my ear. 

 Try as I might, there was no escape; Alexis refused to let me even close my eyes, try to ignore what was happening behind me; she kept my attention firmly on herself and Ben by forcing my participation, reminding me how powerless I was to stop her, as she violated the sanctity of my home and my marriage. 

 "Admit it Shannon...you wanted this to happen, deep down. The minute you saw me, you knew that I would take Ben from you. You didn't even try to stop me. You just kept coming back and absorbing more and more abuse like the fat, grease soaked, sponge you are," she whispered seductively in my ear, blowing gently, "And then you brought me Ben...and you kept bringing him to me, offering him up like a lamb to slaughter, because you knew that I was the one he belonged with. You wanted to see two perfect physical specimens like us fuck. You wanted us to procreate and do our duty to the perpetuation of the species, because you knew your fat, defective, body would only provide Ben with inferior genetics. Admit it...admit it to me, and most of all yourself." 

 It wasn't enough for her that she had won; that she was fucking my husband, in my bed, in my house, with me her helpless prisoner, powerless to stop her...she wanted me to enjoy it. She wanted me to be as aroused as she was, to get off on it, to fully submit to her, to admit that she was right. That I wasn't good enough for Ben. That I didn't deserve him. That I had tricked him into wasting his life on me. That she had a right to tear apart my life and make me feel worthless, and that it was just; a righting of a terrible wrong. 

 "Admit that you're fat." Alexis said into my ear, her hard nipple scraping my back, torquing my arm back farther. 

 "What?" I groaned in pain. 

 "Admit that you're fat! Admit that you're gonna quit fighting for this marriage like you quit your diet! Admit you're gonna run out of her and go get a nice greasy, extra large pizza!" Alexis said, laughing at me while she fucked Ben. She torqued my arm farther, near its breaking point. 

 "AAH, I admit it! I'm fat, okay!? I'm fat! I'm quitting on my marriage! I'm gonna go get a pizza! An extra large pizza! Just please, let me go!" I begged. Alexis bounced harder. 

 "It feels so good!" Ben cried, cumming at my admission. Alexis bounced roughly on my husband's cock as I was forced to watch. I could see his balls tighten up, poised to cum. 

 "Cum in me. Do it!" Alexis begged desperately, pleading with Ben to inject his hot jizz directly into her womb. 

 "Ben, don't!" I begged. 

 "Oh, FUCK YES!" Ben screamed. 

 "Call her fat, then I'll let you cum!" Alexis moaned. 

 "MY WIFE IS FAT! SHE'S SO FAT! FUCK YES!" Ben screamed, shooting his boiling torrent of cum into the no-doubt tight pussy of my personal trainer. 

 "OH, SHAN, YOUR HUSBAND FUCKS SO GOOD!" Alexis screamed, her body quivering as she creamed on my husband's dick. Her grip on my loosened and I fell to the floor with a thud. I grabbed my arm in pain. This was my chance. I had to escape this nightmare. I looked up at Alexis, just in time to see her spit on my face. 

 "Get out of my sight! You disgust me! I hope I don't catch you're fat from touching you!" Alexis said, wiping off the hand that held me down. 

 I had no choice. Alexis had defeated me. I tried to fight her, but she had kicked my ass. I felt anger, hatred, and shamefully... hunger. I hated that I was starving. I hated that Alexis was right. I sprinted from the room, tears falling from my eyes. The last thing I saw as I left the room was her evil, victorious smile. 

 ********** 

 (8 Months later) 

 I was still haunted by what had happened. I still remembered all the details. I remember getting a hotel room for a few days after catching my husband fucking that bitch Alexis. I remember when I finally worked up the nerve to go back home. No one was there. Ben was gone, as was his stuff. The only remnants of his presence were the cum stained sheets on my marital bed and the lingering reek of sex permeating the air. 

 I couldn't tell anyone the details of what happened. All I said was that Ben and I were no longer together. Heidi tried to cheer me up, but it didn't work. We still had game night, but I could not let myself enjoy them. I was still dwelling on Ben. All I could think about was that while we were playing board games, he was with Alexis, playing more adult games. 

 I never told Heidi what happened, but I felt like she knew, somehow. She would give me these looks, these smug little smirks, as if she was looking down on me; as if she viewed me as less of a woman. I never confronted her about it. I just isolated myself, from everyone I cared about. I felt like everyone knew the truth. 

 That I was too fat to hold onto a man. 

 I was a stress eater, I knew that now, there was no denying it, so you can imagine the eating I was doing now. I stopped weighing myself. Every time I thought about losing weight, I thought of Alexis, and when I thought of Alexis; thought of her perfect body, her round ass, her big tits, that I could never have; I felt that deep pit in my stomach...and I had to fill it. 

 In the eight months that had gone by, I had probably put on close to 100 pounds. But I didn't care. I was spiraling down, away from society, sinking deeper and deeper into isolation and depression. 

 Then came the DVD's. 

 I don't know when the DVD's started showing up. In the mail, I received unmarked DVD's in a manila envelope. I still remember the first one I got. I put it in the DVD player, and when I saw what was on it, I nearly choked on my own tongue. 

 I saw a swimming pool. A huge swimming pool. And standing next to it was Alexis. That fucking bitch. I vowed that if I saw her again, I would kick her ass...I would find a way to kick her ass, no matter what it took. Then I saw what she was wearing. 

 Alexis was wearing a hot pink, barely there, string bikini. It was absolutely obscene. I had heard of the term 'micro-bikini', but this took the cake as the skimpiest bikini I had ever seen. 

 There were three teensy tiny patches, one on each nipple, and one on her pussy. Each patch just barely covered what they were trying to cover. These patches were connected by tiny strings. This bikini exposed every part of Alexis, except her nipples and her cunt. Every part of her jutting breasts, except for her nipples, was exposed. Her pussy was barely covered. The rest of her body was glistening with sweat. I hated to admit, she looked amazing. 

 She was just standing there, basking in the sun, when from behind her, Ben emerged, in just his swim trunks and a knee brace. He walked up behind her grabbed her chin in one hand and her hip in the other. He pulled her into a soft kiss as he leaned over her shoulder. His hands moved to her giant breasts, giving them a firm squeeze, her flesh oozing out through his fingers. He moved to her neck, kissing, sucking, and nuzzling her in the same way he used to do to me, causing her to moan. 

 I watch this foreplay session go on for a few minutes before they finally parted, stood side by side, and dived into the pool. I was able to see the rear of Alexis as she dived in. I saw that the back of her bikini was a t-back, exposing nearly every bit of her ass. The string of her top was the only other visible material. 

 I watched as these two perfect specimens swam for a long time, going back and forth. When they were done and they stepped out of the pool, they looked at each other with lust in their eyes. 

 They picture jarringly jumped to a new image. They were on a bed, nude. Alexis was on her stomach, with her ass raised upward. Ben was driving into her, his huge dick buried in her asshole. He drove into her, furiously, with that haunting, rhythm, slap of hips against ass the only sound aside from their filthy, deviant, sex-talk. 

 This went on and on until I saw Ben drive all the way into her. I watched as Alexis' ass tighten as he plowed into her. He held himself inside her for over a minute as they both moaned loudly. After a couple minutes of this, I watched my now ex-husband lean up and slowly remove his cock from her asshole. I finally saw the tip emerge, and I was able to see the many strands of cum connecting his cock and her gaping asshole. Then the video ended. 

 I received another disc the next week. This one had them both working out in what must be Alexis's home gym. I saw them running, lifting weights. I watched her treat him so familiarly, the way a professional trainer wouldn't. They were so intimate as they worked out. Alexis showed off her body in front of him, and he followed her like a dog. This workout went for awhile, then it cut to a scene in the bedroom. 

 In this one, Ben was on top of Alexis, driving his dick into her pussy. I wondered how she was taping this stuff, and then I realized she must have her house rigged up with cameras. The vain bitch must love watching this stuff. I got a good look at her bedroom, and I realized there were mirrors all over. Mirrors so they could see themselves as they fucked. Mirrors so that Alexis could watch herself as she rode my ex-husbands cock, and admire her own body in narcissistic indulgence. The cameras must be behind the mirrors, and the one that was recording this sex session must be in the ceiling. 

 I watched Ben's ass as he pleasured Alexis with his dick. I watched as they exhausted themselves, as they were soaked with sex-sweat. I watched Alexis reach around him to palm his ass. I watched as he drove into her, and held in that position. I watched Alexis squeeze his ass, holding him in place, making sure his load ended up inside her. 

 The next DVD had them doing yoga, stretching in their workout clothes. It was an unusually calm, slow paced workout, at least comparing from what I had seen from them before. But one thing I noticed was, for the first time, Alexis was wearing makeup. Nothing too crazy. Some light eye shadow. Creamy, glossy lips. Without makeup, she was incredibly gorgeous. With makeup, she was just unbelievably stunning. She probably wanted to look good for her man. Show him he made the right choice. But part of it was probably to torture me. Showing me that she didn't have to wear makeup to steal my man. And she wanted to look her best for me, for these nasty DVD's she would send me. These 'workout tapes.' Their workout went on for a few minutes, and then the video jumped again to the bedroom, to a jarringly different scene. On screen, Ben was viciously fucking Alexis doggy style, fucking her like a beast, an animal, slapping her ass while driving himself into her. And when he came inside her, he roared like a lion. 

 The next DVD showed Alexis in her home gym, training another woman. I was confused by this till I realized this woman was a familiar face. Jessica, the wife of Ben's friend. A woman who I was friends with. 

 "You look so good, Jess. That baby weight just melted off of you. It's amazing what a little dedication will do," Alexis complimented her. Last time I saw her, she was very pregnant with twins. She had the kids a few days later. 

 "Well, that's thanks to you, Lexy," Jessica said, treating her as a friend. She had to know what this bitch did to me. 

 "Don't sell yourself short. I've known women with just a bit of a pooch who couldn't even get that off," Alexis said, glancing at the camera. 

 "Oh, thanks babe," Jessica said, stepping off the machine she was on, and giving Alexis a kiss on the cheek. This allowed me to look at her body. She had weighed more than I did with the kids in her belly, but now, he belly was nice and flat, flatter than it ever was, and her breasts looked huge. She looked this good after such a short time, while I ballooned. Not many women could compete with Alexis looks wise, but she could. 

 "I have to get going. I'll see you at game night," Jessica said cheerfully. What? They were still having game night, only I wasn't invited? Alexis had replaced me in my group of friends? It couldn't be? But after a little digging, I found out it was. Apparently, I was being too much of a 'dreary little bitch' to keep going, plus Alexis and Ben together were a lot more fun than me and Ben. They liked that bitch more than they liked me.

 ****** Fit vs. Fat ****** byTheTalkMan© But who could blame them? There had always been an undercurrent of...tolerance within their little clique; like I didn't belong. They were all so attractive, beautiful, popular, and successful...but what was I without Ben? A fat, depressing, wreck. Alexis, meanwhile, belonged. She was a perfect fit; hell she probably took over. That was just how things worked; the most attractive woman with the biggest tits was the head of the pack; the Alpha female...and despite my self-denials, I knew that I had always been the Omega...the runt. The Freak. And they were glad to be rid of me. 

 Week after week, these discs arrived. I don't know why I tortured myself by watching these, but I did. I watched every single one. These workout videos/sex tapes kept coming, and I kept watching. I eventually had a shelf full of them. DVD's full of the man I love fucking another woman. I must be a masochist to hold onto them, but I couldn't help myself. 

 These eight months had passed this way, being tortured by thoughts of my ex with a hotter woman. And then I got a package in the mail. I took the box from the delivery man. It was a thin box and it felt cool to the touch, as if it had been removed from a fridge. As I opened, I realized what was inside of it. A cake. A big, sugary, delicious looking cake, with two candles, one pink and one blue. And on the inside of the box was another DVD. I now knew where this cake came from. 

 I cut myself a thick slice of cake as I went to watch the DVD. I wanted some sign that the good guy I loved was still there. But for the first time, the video wasn't a workout tape. I simply saw Alexis, sitting in a chair, in her micro-bikini. I could only see her head and upper torso framed on screen; her breasts prominently featured. Somehow, they looked bigger, fuller, more pronounced than usual. I had spent a great deal of time examining Alexis perfect tits, and probably knew them almost as well as she...or Ben...did. 

 For the first time in these videos, she spoke directly to me. 

 "Shannon, I hope you have been enjoying the tapes as much as I have making them. Hopefully, they have provided you the proper motivation to lose that weight, but we both it hasn't. Don't worry, these tapes will keep coming. Ben is happier than I have ever seen him, just to let you know. I am talking to you because I realize now why you are fat. I think the issue is Ben. Ben has a tendency to make people women fat. With women like you, you fill your gut with snacks, getting tubby and nasty. With women like me, he makes them fat in a different way." 

 Alexis stood, and revealed her belly; her formally flat belly, that was now heavily bulging in pregnancy, bulging with children. The sight of her heavily pregnant belly while still wearing her bikini was obscene. 

 "This is how Ben makes women like me fat. Listen, I should talk to you, pick up some of your eating habit. Cause I'm eating for three now. HAHAHA! Bye Shannon," Alexis laughed mockingly, for a final time, blowing a kiss at the camera. 

 Alexis was pregnant, heavily pregnant with twins! How had I not noticed this? Maybe she had deliberately hid this from me. Maybe they just taped a lot of material early on, when she was not showing. And now, she was ready to reveal the truth. If they sent that many tapes from early on, judging by the volume of material they sent, it seemed like all must do was work out and fuck. I wondered how much more material they had. But that didn't matter. What mattered was that this bitch was pregnant. I had hoped to be the mother of all of Ben's children, but that position had been stolen from me by my bitch of a trainer. 

 I thought the video was over. But it was not. There was a jarring cut to the bedroom, and there again was the happy couple, participating in their nastiest sex scene yet. Alexis, heavily pregnant, completely nude, riding Ben's cock up her ass like a bucking bronco. Just vicious, nasty stuff. Ben's hands roamed her pregnant belly, and then traveled to her gigantic, swollen breasts. He squeezed them roughly, and his hands became soaked, not only with sweat, but from the life-giving milk leaking from her overfilled tits. Alexis sneered at her lover, letting him know that her pregnancy was not going to stop her from giving him the rough sex he now needed. She collapsed onto him, and they both tensed up and screamed hoarsely, their orgasms almost painfully good. Alexis climbed off of him, and got on all fours, displaying her tight asshole to the camera, leaking Ben's cum. 

 "You think she'll like that?" Ben asked. What? Was he talking about me? Did he know he was being filmed? 

 "It'll be her favorite." Alexis said with a laugh. She reached back into her ass crack and scooped the cum off the finger. "She'll like this too." she added, causing both to laugh. "She's such a fat ass we could feed her this cum, straight from my ass, and she'll still eat it and beg for more! She's that desperate to have you back she'll take what she can get! Next time she gets a big box of glazed donuts, we'll all know where that glaze came from!" Alexis said, bursting with laughter. Ben joined in, laughing alongside the mother of his children. 

 I looked down at the cake on my plate suspiciously, at the smooth white frosting. No... it couldn't be. Ben wouldn't actually do that. Plus, the cake was very good. I took another bite, and a bit of it fell onto my shirt. 

 As I cleaned off the frosting on my top, I looked at myself. Wearing sweatpants, and an old t-shirt. I was now grossly overweight, and the house was a mess. I didn't realize how good I had it. Why did my old issues have to crop up? I now knew the truth. I knew that no matter how good a guy was, he could be swayed by a woman with huge tits. I was desperate to grow breasts, and despite all of the weight I gained, none of it went to my chest. I was still flat. I knew better than that, but the damage was done. I should've just got implants, but it would have been a waste. 

 Now, just, look at me. I was disgusting, but I couldn't stop myself from eating. I had not had a man look at me with desire since Ben left me. And I had done it to myself. I looked damn good before, especially in comparison to now. But right now, I was just a mess. I looked awful. A giant cake that I would no doubt polish off in a couple days was next to me. My daily wardrobe consisted of sweatpants and ratty old shirts, stretched to the max by my fat belly. Right now, there was no chance I was going to get a man interested in me. 

 That was why I hated Alexis. It wasn't that she was a grade-A cunt. No, the reason I hated her was that I was jealous. I wished I could be her. Badly. I wished I could be a tenth of what she was. She was everything I wanted to be. And her, this pinnacle of sexiness, this gorgeous woman, had stolen my life. She had stolen all of my dreams. I wanted to live the rest of my life with Ben, being the sexy piece of ass on his arm. But Alexis, she had taken that from me. She looked better than I ever could, and she was with the man I loved. She was the piece of ass on his arm. She was the one that he showed off. She was the one that made woman fume with jealousy. She was everything I wish she was. This woman I hated had the life I always wanted. 

 I hated that she was so much sexier than I was. I hated that while that bitch got off by stuffing her pussy with my husband's fat cock, the only way I ever got pleasure these days was by stuffing my pussy with my fat fingers. I hated that I sometimes wished I had taken her up on her offer to take a whiff of her perfect ass, simply to get a sniff of perfection. I hated that I had the DVD's neatly aligned in chronological order on my shelf. I hated that I had watched each one more than once. I hated that I forced myself to watch my husband in action, seeing what I could have had, seeing what I wish I had, and seeing what I had lost. I hated what I had become, but I hated the thought of changing even more. I hated that I was fat, and I hated that I always would be. 

 Why did I have to sabotage myself and my marriage, just to lose a few pounds? I hadn't lost any weight, but I had lost something so much more important. 

 *********** 

 (Alexis) 

 I loved where I was at in life. And I loved what I had turned Ben into. As much I had changed Ben for the worse, in some ways, he had changed me for the better. I was happy! I felt, for the first time, the feeling of contentment; real emotion, instead of that intellectual numbness I had grown so used to all my life. It wasn't that I couldn't feel emotion before; it's just that I had no reason to. I was bored out of my skull; I was too smart, and everything was too easy, so I become disinterested, I shut myself down. Since I began plaguing Shannon, since I had targeted Ben, I finally faced a challenge worthy of my attention; a trial that truly engaged me, and it had brought out all the repressed, pent up, emotion I had hidden away inside me. I was a changed woman, a happy woman, a loving woman...well, for the most part. 

 There was no doubt that I was still an evil bitch. Before Ben, I had never cared about the men I fucked. It was always more for my pleasure than for theirs, but with Ben, I cared for him deeply. I don't know if I loved him, I was definitely smitten, but what I did love was how he made me feel when he fucked me. He made me cum like I never had before. That was enough for me to accept his proposal when he put a rock on my finger. 

 I had never felt the desire to have kids, either, but when Ben put twins in my belly almost immediately after shacking up with me, I was more excited than I anticipated. I loved the idea of getting pregnant by another woman's husband, and that was the appeal for letting myself get knocked up. But as I felt life growing in my belly, I realized how badly I wanted to be a Mommy. I realized I wanted to be good mother. I realized how much I cared for these kids growing inside. 

 I realized I loved them. 

 But while some things change, some don't. As I was riding Ben in our bed, me still in my favorite pink bikini, and as his hands wandered my pregnant belly and my swollen with milk, newly minted EE breasts, I wasn't watching him. I wasn't looking at my husband. I was looking at myself in the mirror. I posed for the cameras, licking my lips. If there was one thing that turned me on like no other, it was torturing Shannon with my sex-tapes. I knew she was watching them. I just knew it. And that was what I loved most of all. Torturing that fat pig while I fucked her soul-mate. That was my real hobby. My true addiction. 

 As I posed for the cameras, and as I looked at my body, at my even bigger tits, at my eight months pregnant belly, and my still hot ass, I could only think one thing: 

 'God, I'm so fucking sexy.'
