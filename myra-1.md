Myra

It didn't come as a surprise to me because I had been expecting it or at least something like it. 

It was a Wednesday and Myra and I were eating dinner when she said, "Don't make any plans for us this weekend. The girls from work and I are going to a spa for the weekend. One of the girls arranged for a group package. It will be a weekend of mud baths, mudpacks manicures, pedicures and the like." 

"Okay." 

"Okay? That's it? Just okay?" 

"What did you expect?" 

"I thought that you would want to talk about it." 

I looked her right in the eye and said, "You did not say "Honey, would it be all right with you if..." or "Tom would you mind if..."or Babe, the girls at work are planning on a weekend away and would you mind if..." you just told me that you were going and so I said okay." 

I put my fork down, wiped my mouth with a napkin and then stood up and headed for the door. 

"Where are you going?" 

"Down to Bud's Bar to see if there is anyone there I can shoot some pool with while I have a few beers. I may be late so don't bother waiting up." 

Actually that wasn't were I was going. I had a friend at work who had a brother who worked for an oil company and who was going on an overseas assignment. He would be gone for a year and was looking for someone to sublet his apartment while he was gone. I was going to meet Sam and go over and take a look at the place. If I liked it I would consider taking it on. Then Myra could enjoy her weekend and then find out that she was living alone when she came home. She wouldn't find someone waiting there to serve her papers or anything like that. She would just find me gone. 

I liked Mike's place and I told him that I would take it if my marriage went tits up by the weekend and it was still available. He told me that he had another guy who was interested in the place and that the guy would be there at 10 a.m. on Saturday to look the place over. He told me he would hold the place for me until 9 on Saturday. He wished me luck and then Sam and I did go to Bud's to have a few brews and shoot some pool. Around eleven-thirty I went home and Myra was in bed either sleeping or pretending to be asleep. I just got in bed, turned my back to her and went to sleep. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Why was I setting up to move? Because Myra was setting out to cheat on me (if she hadn't already) and I wasn't going to sit still for it. If I knew for sure that she hadn't yet done it I probably would have gone proactive to try and put a stop to it before it could start, but from what I knew I couldn't be anywhere close to sure and I wouldn't live my life wondering if she had and might do it again. 

How did I know what was going on? Because I had good friends. One Wednesday three weeks ago while I was at work Ralph came into my office and asked me to meet him at Barney's Tavern after work. I met him and after we had ordered and taken a pull on our Buds he asked: 

"Are you and Myra alright?" 

"That's a strange question to ask." 

"I'm not happy having to ask it, but I need to know if you and Myra are on the outs or not." 

I gave him a long questioning look before saying, "As far as I know we are okay, but I'm starting to think that for some reason you don't think so. What gives Ralph?" 

"Try not to shoot the messenger Tom, but Myra seems to be getting involved with a guy she met at the Apollo Lounge during one of her nights out with the girls she works with and I just thought you should know." 

I knew what he was talking about. Myra didn't actually have a girl's night out. What she did was stop after work with the girls she worked with for a drink or two before coming home. It was usually on a Tuesday and she was usually home by seven although in the last three weeks it was closer to nine or nine-thirty. Naturally I had to ask Ralph to clarify. I need to point out that Myra didn't know Ralph, but he knew who she was because of the dozen or so pictures I had of her around my office. The take I got from him was that he usually met his brother at the Apollo for drinks on Tuesdays and he had seen Myra come in with some of the girls she worked with. He recognized her right away from her pictures. On Tuesday four weeks ago he had been at the Apollo and saw three guys join the girls at their table. After a bit Myra had gotten up and danced with one of the guys. She danced with him several more times before she got up to leave. The guy she had danced with walked out with her. He came back in about twenty minutes later and one of the other guys at the table gave him a thumbs up with a questioning look and the guy who had walked Myra out had smiled and given a thumbs up. 

The next week the guy was already there when Myra arrived and he went right over and joined the girls at their table. He danced with Myra several times and when she got ready to leave he again walked her out only this time he didn't come back in. 

"Last night it was the same except Myra only stayed for two drinks before leaving and again the guy walked her out and never came back in. I have no idea what or if anything happened when they left, but I thought you needed to know what was going on." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The following Tuesday I was sitting with Ralph and his brother when Myra and her coworkers came in. I wasn't worried that she would recognize me because I was wearing a fake beard and a ball cap and Ralph, his brother and I were sitting in the darkest corner of the lounge. Maybe ten minutes after we got there three guys came in and Ralph pointed them out and told me that the tall one was the guy that Myra always danced with. The three put three tables together and then sat down and ordered drinks. Five minutes later Myra and her friends came in and went right to the table where the three guys were. Myra took the chair next to the tall guy and leaned over and kissed him. 

The group at the table talked for a bit and then one of the guys got up and fed some coins into the jukebox and the dancing started. Myra only danced with the tall guy while the other two took turns dancing with Myra's four coworkers. After about a half hour dancing and a couple or three drinks the dancing turned into what could only be called 'dirty dancing' and at times Myra and the tall guy were so close together that I couldn't have pushed a sheet of paper between them and the tall guys hand were all over her body. She would have slapped my face if I had tried to do that with her in public. At one point he was grinding his cock into her leg and she was and she was pushing back at him. 

When the music stopped they went back to the table and Myra said something to her girlfriends and then she picked up her purse and she and the tall guy left the lounge. Once they were out the door I got up to follow and Ralph said: 

"Be cool Tom. Don't do anything stupid and get your ass tossed in jail." 

"Not to worry bud. I'm not the violent type. I'm just going to observe. At least for now." 

I walked out of the building just in time to see Myra get into a car with the tall guy. They immediately slid together and started necking. I moved to a spot where I wouldn't be noticed and watched the pair. They were going at it hot and heavy and not paying any attention to what was going on around them and I was able to get close enough to hear the sounds. I heard "something better than this" from the guy and from Myra "I want it too, but..." and then a car pulled into the lot and I had to duck down so the car lights wouldn't expose me and so I missed some of the conversation. When I could get back up I heard "This weekend we..." and I had to duck down again, but I'd heard and seen enough. When the people in the car that had just pulled in went into the lounge I made my way to my car and went home. I was in bed when Myra got home and when she came into the bedroom I pretended to be asleep. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning I was in the breakroom at work sipping coffee and looking through an apartment rental guide when Sam sat down with me, saw the guide and asked me why I was looking at apartments. I told him and he told me about his brother. 

Thursday at work I spent what free time I had making a list of things to do and a list of what to take with me if I moved out. If? Yes, if. If Myra went through with her weekend I was gone. If she got cold feet and cancelled her little outing I'd sit down with her and have a 'come to Jesus' meeting with her. I'd let her know what I knew and we would take it from there. If she didn't go our marriage might - just might - stand a chance. It would be up to her. 

Thursday over dinner Myra dumped it on me that she would be leaving for her weekend right from work on Friday and I didn't say a word. When we finished up eating I got up and went into the living room and turned on the TV. About an hour later Myra came into the room naked except for high heels and said: 

"Care to give me enough to hold me until I come home Sunday evening?" 

It must have shocked her when I said, "No thanks." 

She looked at me for a moment or two and then she said, "Something is bothering you. I can tell." 

"You already know what is bothering me Myra." 

"What? This weekend thing? Why are you bothered that I'm going to spend a weekend with the girls from work?" 

"The girls Myra? If it was a weekend with the girls it probably wouldn't bother me" I said as I got up and headed for the door. 

"What? What do you mean y that?" 

"You were smart enough to graduate from college with a degree Myra so you should be smart enough to figure it out." 

"Where are you going?" 

"Out!" 

"Get back here Tom. You can't say what you just said and walk away. Get back here and talk to me." 

I didn't answer her; I just left the house, got in my car and drove down to Bud's Bar. I drank some beer and shot some pool with a few guys I knew and around eleven I went home. There was a note taped to the door that said, "Wake me when you get home. We need to talk!" Need was underlined. 

I went into the house, kicked off my shoes, set the alarm on my watch to wake me up at six and then I sacked out on the couch. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

He alarm woke me at six and I got up, put on my shoes and left the house. I would look kind of scruffy when I got to work because I was wearing yesterday's clothes that I'd slept in, but I was high enough up in the food chain that I doubted that anyone would say anything about it. 

I stopped for breakfast at a Village Inn and over coffee, pancakes and bacon I planned out my weekend. If Myra was at the house when I got home we would have our 'come to Jesus' meeting and if she wasn't Sam's brother would get a call from me and I would be out of the house and gone when Myra got home from 'her weekend with the girls'. 

When I got to work I told Donna, my secretary, that I didn't want any phone calls from Myra put through to me, "And if she wants to leave a message take it, but toss it into the waste basket." 

"Trouble in Paradise?" 

"Of the worst kind." 

I caught a slight smile starting on her face. Donna had flirted with me since the day she was assigned to me, but I knew that it was just 'office fun' since she had a fiancée that she was gaa gaa over. 

The day was fairly busy and I spent the morning putting out fires and trying to calm down upset clients. Just before two there was a commotion in the outer office and I heard Donna yell, "You can't go in there." The door to my office opened and Myra came storming in with Donna right behind her. 

"I'm sorry boss. I told her you weren't here and that she couldn't go into your office. You want me to call security?" 

"No; I'll take care of it." 

Donna left and I looked Myra right in the eye and asked, "What the fuck do you want Myra?" 

She didn't back off like I expected, but came right back at me. 

"What do I want? I want to know what the fuck is wrong with you. First was that shit from last night and then you wouldn't return my calls this morning. I want to know why you didn't wake me up when you got home last night and don't give me any of that "I didn't want to disturb you" garbage. I left a note telling you to wake me up and I want to know why you didn't do it. You knew I wanted to talk to you so I want to know why you got up and left the house before we could talk. That's what the hell I want!" 

"You know damned well why I didn't want to talk to you Myra. I didn't want to do or say anything that might ruin your weekend with THE GIRLS!" 

"Is that what this is all about? You are in a pissy mood because I'm going to spend a weekend with the girls I work with?" 

"No Myra; I am not in a pissy mood over the weekend over your weekend with THE GIRLS! I'm in a pissy mood over the weekend you have planned with the asshole you spent Tuesday night making out with in the Apollo parking lot. 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Give it up Myra. The fact that I just told you that I knew what you were doing Tuesday should be enough to tell you that you have been busted. A good friend of mine came to me and told me how you have been behaving on your Tuesday nights. I couldn't bring myself to believe him so I was there Tuesday night and I watched the show you put on with your boyfriend at the table and on the dance floor. When you left the bar with him I followed you out. I saw you get in the car with him and I saw what the two of you did. The two of you were so into it that you didn't even notice me when I moved up next to the car and watched and listened to what was going on." 

"You misunderstood what was going on Tom." 

"I didn't misunderstand shit Myra. I was right there and I saw and heard everything. And since we are having it out you might as well hear that when you get home from your weekend with THE GIRLS you will find that I have moved out. Now, if you don't mind, I have work to do and you being here is interfering with my doing it." 

"Oh no Tom; we still have t..." 

"Get the hell out of here Myra." 

"I'm not leave..." 

I hit the intercom button and told Donna to get security to remove Myra from my office and then I got up and walked out. I took the stairwell up to the fourth floor and then paced back and forth in the hallway until enough time had passed for Myra to have been escorted out of the building. When I got back to my office Donna told me that I might not want to hurry home after work. 

"She was pissed boss. She might be waiting for you with a frying pan meaning to decorate your head with it." 

The rest of the day passed by without incident and when I got off work, since I had nothing to hurry home to, I hit the bar just down the street from work. I stayed for two beers and then I headed on home to start packing. I was going to be pretty busy for the next couple of days. I wanted to get everything out of the house and into storage except for what I would need at Mike's apartment. I'd need to call him first thing in the morning and tell him I was going to take it. I'd need to get a motel or hotel room for the two weeks until he left for his overseas assignment. I'd need to stop at the bank and take care of the business of separating funds. I'd worry about getting an attorney sometime next week. The important thing for me was to be gone when Myra got home from her weekend. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got home I was surprised to find my driveway and the street in front of my house full of parked cars. I had to park on the street two houses away. When I walked in the front door I heard a lot of conversation coming from the living room and when I got to the room I saw nine women sitting there. I recognized some of them from Myra's company Christmas party. All conversation stopped and nine sets of eyes swung toward me. Not having the slightest idea of what was going on I just said "Good evening ladies" and headed for the staircase to the upstairs. 

Myra, who apparently had been in the kitchen when I came in, came into the room just as I had put my first foot on the steps and said: 

"Wait a minute Tom; we need to talk to you in here." 

If it had just been Myra I would have ignored her and gone on up, but the "We need" grabbed my curiosity so I turned and went into the living room. Myra said, "I'm sure you remember Alice and she has something to say to you." 

I looked over at Alice and she said, "My husband belongs to the Fraternal Order of Eagles and they have dances once a month. Usually they have drawings for prizes at the dances and two weeks ago my husband won a weekend for two at the Belmont Plaza Spa. He didn't want to go so he told me to find someone to go with me. My problem was who could I ask without upsetting the ones I didn't ask so I called the spa and talked them into giving me a group rate and then I asked all the girls in the office if they wanted to go. The nine of us here and Myra said they wanted to go and we were all set to leave from work tonight when Myra told us of your problem. We are all here to see if we can fix it. According to Myra you believe she is sneaking off to meet some guy and we are all here to tell you that isn't true." 

I glanced around the room at the group and then said, "I think it is commendable that you have all rallied around Myra in her hour of need, but it is a misguided attempt on your part. I saw Myra misbehaving with my own eyes and I overheard her making plans to meet with a guy this weekend. She might have been going to go to the spa with you, but she wasn't going to be doing any of the rest of you would be doing. She would be spending her time hanging horns on me with the ass wipe who picked her up at the lounge." 

"That isn't true" Beverly March said. "We all knew what she was going to do to George. Myra told us before she ever did her first dance with him what she planned on doing to him." 

"What she was going to do to him?" 

"George is one of those dickheads who thinks he is God's gift to women. He is always hitting on the girls who come into the lounge. Myra thought it would be a kick to string him along and get him to buy drinks for us. She set him up. She led him along and when we planned our weekend she told him about it and led him to believe he could meet her there and they could have a wild weekend together. We all knew about it because Myra kept us clued in. A couple of us even hinted to him that Myra would hook up with him if he tried hard enough. We told him that she was ready to cheat on you because she found out you were cheating on her so she wanted to get even." 

"You expect me to believe this song and dance? I heard her arrange to meet him." 

"Yes Tom" Myra said, "You did hear me arrange to meet him, but did you hear where?" 

"No. I just heard you say you would meet him this weekend." 

Myra walked over toward me and handed me an envelope. "Read this" she said. I opened the envelope, took out a page and read it. It was a letter of confirmation listing all the names of the ten women in the room. I shrugged and said: 

"So what? This just says that you are going to be there, but I already knew that. You will be there and he will meet you there." 

"No he won't. The Belmont is in Riverton and Riverton is 163 miles from Addisville. Call the Red Roof Inn in Addisville and see if George Thomas has checked in yet. He should already be there anxiously awaiting my arrival. It will be a long wait because I won't show up. I would have been in Riverton by now with the rest of the girls if you would have just talked with me earlier. My friends gave up their weekend so they could help me." 

"Riverton is only an hour's drive so you can still have your weekend." 

"They don't want to go without me and I can't go leaving you here to think what you are thinking." 

"That's easy enough to take care of" I said and went into the kitchen and picked up the phone. I got directory assistance, got the phone number for the Red Roof Inn in Addisville and called. They confirmed that my' Uncle George' had arrived and checked in. Then I got directory assistance again and called the Belmont and asked if Mrs. Myra Walsh had arrived yet and was told that that she and her party hadn't yet arrived. Satisfied that I was getting the true story I went back to the living room and told them that Thomas was in Addisville.  

===

"So you girls need to get on the road if you want to get there in time to get enough sleep before tomorrow." 

"I still think I need to stay home and mend some fences" Myra said. 

"No you don't. I made a lot of plans as to what I was going to do while you were off with Mr. Thomas and I'm going to need time to undo them all so I wouldn't be around much anyway" I said. 

But you could bet money on the fact that Myra and I were going to have a long talk when she got home. I was not at all pleased with what she had been doing while leading Mr. George Thomas on. 

"Are you sure you won't mind" Myra asked and I told her to leave and enjoy herself. 

Once the women were gone I sat down with a stiff drink of Mr. Jack Daniels best and thought about the situation. The question was did I really believe the story that was laid on me by the women? It could all be true of course, but it could have just as likely been planned that Myra would actually gone to Addisville instead of Riverton, but could she actually get nine other women to back her? To me it did not seem likely. Granted that Myra had worked with most of the nine for almost ten years, but in all that time I'd never seen her get close enough to any one of them to get them to lie for her let alone nine of them. I polished off my Jack and went to bed. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning I called Mike and let him know that I wouldn't be taking his place after all. That done I went over to the IHOP for some breakfast. As I ate I wondered what to do with the rest of my weekend. I don't know where it came from, but I suddenly felt the need to have words with Mr. George Thomas. In my mind he was the kind of asshole who would shrug off Myra's not showing and decide that since he was already there and had already paid for a room he would stay and see if he could hook up with some woman. I called the Red Roof in and verified that 'my Uncle George' was still checked in. I finished my breakfast and pointed my car toward Addisville. 

As I drove I imagined my little face to face with 'Uncle George'. With any kind of luck I might be able to catch him alone with no witnesses around and I was smiling at the thought when I pulled into the parking lot of the Red Roof Inn. My smile disappeared before I could even get out of the car. There was a Bob Evans restaurant next to the Red Roof and I glanced that way as I reached for the door handle. The glance was just in time to see Myra come out of the restaurant with Thomas. Right behind her was Beverly March arm in arm with a man who was not her husband. I took my hand off the door handle, got out my cell, activated the camera and started taking pictures of the four of them as they headed back toward the Red Roof. 

I sat there for a minute or two and debated on what to do. I decided against a confrontation. Too public and while I fancied my chances against Thomas I couldn't be sure that Beverly's guy wouldn't jump in to help his buddy. No; I'd just go on home and start my scorched earth policy. I called Mike to see if his place was still available and he told me that it wasn't. I'd just have to settle for a motel until I could find something. I stopped at a U-Haul place on the way home and got a bunch of boxes to pack stuff in and when I got home I packed up to leave. It took four trips, but I had everything I wanted out of the house and in storage by nine that evening. Everything except the computer and printer. 

At nine-thirty I called Marv March and told him the story and asked if he would like a copy of the pictures I'd taken. I was not surprised at all when he said yes. I downloaded the photos from the phone into the computer and then emailed all nine to him. Then I got out the address book and called the husbands of the four of the nine that I had numbers for. I told them the story of what had happened and then told them that I hadn't seen their wives with Myra, but if their wives were willing to lie for Myra I wouldn't be at all surprised if she had something to hide that she might need Myra's help to cover up some day. 

The last thing I did before going to bed was to go online to my bank. Besides our joint checking and savings accounts I had a personal account that I used solely for business. All of my expense account checks went into it and all of my business expenses came out of it. I took all but a hundred dollars out of the checking and savings and moved it into my business account. I'd no doubt that I would have to give half of it back when I got the divorce going, but I felt good knowing that until that happened things were going to be really tight for Myra. 

Lastly I got on the phone and cancelled all of our joint credit cards. That left me with an American Express that I used for business and was in my name only. Myra had a Visa that was in her name only, but it only had a twenty-three hundred dollar limit and Myra was always pretty close to that limit. Satisfied with what I had done I went to bed and slept soundly. 

In the morning I took a last look around to see if there was anything that I missed. Then I printed out the pictures I'd taken in Addisville and spread them out on the kitchen table. I took my wedding ring off and placed it in the center of the table, took the computer and printer out and put them in the car. I took one last look around and then walked out the front door for the last time. By two I was checked into a motel and then I turned off my cell and went to a movie. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I called into work on Monday and told them I needed a day off for some personal business. I was at the bank when it opened and I verified that all of my internet transactions had gone through and then had my name removed from the joint account. Around four I turned my cell back on and surprise surprise I had a dozen missed messages and voice mails from Myra. I deleted them all and then turned the cell off again. That evening I hit a country/western bar I liked and there were several unattached ladies there and I drank and danced until eleven and then I headed for the motel for a good night's rest before going into work the next morning. 

I was not surprised when I got to work to find Myra sitting in her car waiting for me. I could have avoided her by driving around the block and going into the building through the loading dock, but I knew that I was going to have to have it out with her sooner or later so I decided to just get it over with. I pulled into my assigned parking space and in the side view mirror I saw Myra get out of her car and hurry toward me trying to get to me when I got out of the car, but before she had a chance to open her mouth I said: 

"I don't have any time for your bullshit right now Myra. Be at Carl's Lounge tonight at six and I'll give you fifteen minutes to tell me your lies." 

I walked away from her and she followed me into the building calling out "Wait Tom; wait a minute." I walked by the desk in the lobby and told Harry, the security guard, that Myra was to be denied access to the building and if she gave him any shit to call the cops on her. She was trying to get by Harry as I got onto the elevator and the door closed. I didn't know if Harry did call the cops on her, but deep down inside me I hoped that he did. 

When I got to my office Donna asked, "Where were you yesterday? That wife of yours apparently didn't believe me the half dozen times she called and I told her that you had taken the day off. She showed up here twice trying to get into your office to see if you were here. I had to call security to get her to leave." 

"She is apparently pissed that I'm so pissed off at her cheating on me that I moved out on her." 

"Temporary spat or you're done?" 

We are done." 

"When you are ready to date again let me know." 

"Why? I thought you and Gary were solid." 

"We are, but I know three or four girls who happen to think that you are pretty neat." 

"I'll keep that in mind, but I'm afraid that's going to be pretty far down the road. I won't do anything while I'm still married to her and I haven't even talked to a lawyer yet." 

"Just let me know when you are ready." 

I told her I would and then I got busy doing what they paid me to do. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I got to Carl's early so I could have a drink or three to fortify me for the meeting with Myra. I couldn't imagine what she had to say to me since I had the photos showing that she had lied to me, but I needed to shut her down. I couldn't have her constantly calling me at work or showing up there to cause a disturbance. 

At five to six I saw Myra come in, spot me and head for my booth. I sat there thinking "I'll bet the first words out of her mouth will be "It wasn't what you are thinking Tom" and I wasn't too far off. She sat down across from me and took a pull on the drink I'd ordered for her when I had ordered my last one and then said: 

"You are overreacting Tom. What you saw isn't what you think it was." 

"I said I'd give you fifteen minutes Myra. You can fill those minutes with lies, half-truths or facts. I don't care which, but I'm up and out of here in fifteen minutes and you are on the clock." 

"When we left the house I rode with Bev. We got to talking about the situation and she told me that she was of what Thomas might do the next time he saw me stop with the girls. We decided that it would be best if we drove to Addisville and just told Thomas that you had caught on to what was happening and confronted me over it. Then I'd tell him that I was sorry, but I couldn't risk my marriage by having any more to do with him. Bev called her brother who lives just outside Addisville and asked him to meet us at Bob Evans. She wanted him there if Thomas decided to get nasty or violent. When we got there I called George's room and asked him to meet me at the restaurant. When he showed up I told him that you had found out about us and told me that if I went through with things not to bother coming home. I told him I had decided that I couldn't lose my marriage over a fling. He took it surprisingly well and then Bev and I drove over to Riverton and joined the rest of the girls." 

"You really expect me to buy that cock and bull story?" 

"Why not? It's all true and I can prove it." 

"And just how in hell can you do that?" 

"First off you can call Bev's husband and he can verify that the man in the pictures with Bev is her big brother. Secondly" she said as she handed me her phone, "I know you Tom and I knew that even though you told me to go and have fun at the spa there would always be just a kernel of doubt in your mind. When we got to the spa I gave Bev my phone and I had her take pictures of me doing just what I told you I would be doing." 

I looked at her phone and damned if they didn't back up her story. While I had her phone I looked in the directory and found she had Bev's cell and home phone numbers. I called the home phone and Marv answered. After I identified myself I said: 

"I just talked to my wife and I guess I shit in my mess kit when I sent you those pictures." 

"No harm done. As soon as I saw them I knew that it was her brother. When she got home she told me what had gone on. You and Myra going to be okay?" 

"Yeah; I think so. We will have some talking to do, but I think we are good." 

I disconnected and handed Myra's phone back to her. 

"Are we okay" Myra asked. 

"Yes, but we are going to have a long talk once I get moved back in. I am not the least bit happy about the things you did with Thomas even if you were doing it just to string him along." 

"I realize that it was wrong and I swear to God I will never do it again. Will you come home with me now? We can worry about getting your stuff moved back in later. Right now I just need to get you home so I can show you how much you mean to me." 

I smiled at her and said, "Lead the way." Report_Story
