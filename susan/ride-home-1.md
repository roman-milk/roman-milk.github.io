A moment of madness 

Hearing the front door close quietly behind Jim, Susan sighed heavily. Jim had been her boyfriend for nine years and they had been living together in this same flat for four. He had sneaked off to the club avoiding an argument, the same one they had hashed over for the last six months. Where was the relationship going? She would ask and he would just shrug his shoulders not wanting the discussion, not wanting to understand her needs. 

It was so pathetic. She would have understood if it had been a proper man's club but they went to play with toy cars on a huge electric track in a converted basement. It typified his escapist attitude; not wanting to grow up. They were both thirty-four and she felt time was slipping by without achieving anything. 

It was Friday evening and she had a week off to look forward to but didn't think she could face it with him. She fancied Egypt but not alone and he wouldn't miss a so called important race competition. It was so pathetic she didn't dare tell friends in the office why they weren't going somewhere exciting. 

The phone rang startling her from the reverie that threatened to turn to something approaching depression. "Hi! Yes June. Oh, the usual, nothing exciting. No I don't feel like it. I'm past clubbing. Well, OK. I'll be there in twenty minutes." Susan sighed for the umpteenth time. June was out tonight and Susan was going to fix her hair. 

*** 

"Just call me Cinderella." Susan said as she walked into her friend's house. June was twenty-four, ten years younger, and still looking for Mr Wright only she had a habit of finding Mr Wrong. Plain for all too see but her. "Come on then let's get you fixed up." 

"What's wrong with you Susan? You're an attractive woman but you've let yourself go. Here try this on." June bullied her as she did everyone. Susan was attractive with long shapely legs, small pert breasts and a slim waist. Clothes looked god on her but she hadn't bothered dressing to please for the last year. 

Susan wasn't the kind of person to give in but she just couldn't seem to gather the energy to resist. It seemed easier to just go along with her friend. Trying on a dress she looked in the mirror twirling the short hem to and fro. 

"It's too. I don't know." She didn't want to say it was too young for her. "It's too short. I don't like to show off so much cleavage either." At June's look she added. "I'm tempted though." With a glass of wine in one hand and June's encouragement she finally gave in. 

"Go take a shower. I'll dig out a new set of underwear and fix you up." Brushed and flicked and straightened Susan's long black hair gleamed, seeming once more to be alive. June appraised her friend and told her she looked good. Susan felt good too but put that down the large glasses of wine. 

*** 

Already a little tipsy from the unfamiliar early drink Susan walked into the club arm in arm with her friend. They all seemed so young. At least she wouldn't meet anyone she knew. It had only been a couple of hours and she was bored already. Sitting there watching everyone have a good time had worn her patience rather thin. 

'Hmmm. He's nice.' Susan thought. A young man was standing right in front of her with his tight bum wiggling to the music. 'Nice broad shoulders and long legs.' Before her thoughts could meander a couple of girls caught hold of him to flirt outrageously, fluttering false eyelashes at him. If she had nails she would have sharpened them on the table as a warning, 'hands off!' 

"I'm booked for this one, sorry girls." He said. "Come on darling it's our song." 

Awoken from her thoughts by a strong hand lifting her from the stool she let out a startled gasp, buried by the heavy sound of what was meant to be music. Looking close he winked a devilish grin at her and deftly turned toward the dance floor dragging her with him. 

Reaching for words of protest she managed only some incoherent sounds lost under the loud music. It had happened so quickly; from sitting admiring his bum to being whisked onto the dance floor; she was completely out of her depth. 

As soon as they reached into the crowd of manic waving limbs the tune slowed and softened. "Sorry about that." He said into her ear. "Thanks for helping me avoid those two. They're nice girls but a bit too much at times." 

While recovering from the deep voice breathing tickling sensations into an ear he wrapped an arm around her waist. Holding a hand outright he led her around the dance floor in a dizzying chase. Susan wasn't even sure what step it was but managed to follow his lead. When the music slowed again he wrapped both arms around her and they stood still with just a gentle sway of their hips. 

"What's your name?" he asked. 

"Susan," she managed to reply, with her breath just returning after their gallop around the dance floor. 

"Mine's Barry. You're a good dancer." He said. 

"I don't think I know what I'm doing, just following," she joked but meant it. 

"You can get into trouble that way." He teased, giving her a saucy wink. 

The dance ended and with the same intense whirl he landed her back at the small table next to June. Still holding her hand he lifted it to his lips. With another wink, this time hinting at a shared secret, he turned and disappeared into the crowd. 

"So how did you meet him?" June asked. The few words dripped green with accusations. 

"Oh! Barry?" Susan laughed intent on teasing. 

"You're a married woman. Behave yourself. Pass him on to me you bitch." 

"I'm not married. I'm not sure what I am." Her voice trailed off on hitting a sore point. "Look, thanks for the nice evening but I've got to go. I'm not used to all this fun. You know what Jim is like." Susan shouted over the noise. She couldn't hear the reply but the look and nodding head meant 'Oh Yeah? Leaving for home are we?' 

Susan laughed again not believing June could possibly believe she had a chance with that handsome young man. He only looked nineteen. Nice thought though! 

Outside it was pouring with rain, no cats or dogs, but plenty of stair rods. Hoping from foot to foot she wished she had gone to the restroom before leaving. Craning forward looking down the street she realised it was such an awful night it would be impossible to see a taxi unless it pulled right up in front of the club. At that moment a car swung into the curb from across the street and she dived in to the passenger seat. 

"I thought it was you! Where can I take you?" Barry asked. 

The young man took Susan by surprise once again. Lost for words for a moment she recovered enough to tell him the address. Looking around she realised this wasn't a taxi. With the windscreen wipers barely coping at full speed this was not a night to demand to be dropped off somewhere nearby; it would have to be right to the door to avoid a soaking. 

"It's nice of you to give me a lift," she said. Not expecting him to accept she added, "The least I can do is offer a coffee." 

He was already out of the car and opening hers as soon as the words left her lips. Running to the front door they careened through it together. Shaking off the rain like terriers she laughed with his infectious throaty chuckle. 

"Wait in there I'll make a cup of coffee," her voice sounded more confident now she was on home ground. 

"White no sugar," he said as she disappeared into the kitchen. 

With the kettle on she dashed to the bathroom. Such a relief! With the kettle blowing off steam she dashed back to switch it off. Jim just wouldn't replace the damn thing which had been broken a month so it wouldn't automatically switch off. 

In the lounge he sat back on the leather sofa looking relaxed and at home. She looked at the time knowing Mr Clockwork, Jim, would be back soon. She was perfectly safe and in any case, she could handle this young man with a few well chosen words if necessary. 

She had perfected the right tone to go with the word 'No!' It had been a long time since anyone had given her the opportunity to practice it though. Even with Jim it had been awhile. She cleared her mind of that sad thought. 

Bending to pull a small table from its nest she was conscious of his attention and became careful, a little nervous blushed wiped her face. 'What the hell!' she thought. It wasn't often she had someone's attention and it was in her own home too. She glanced at the clock again. 

"I think I deserve a kiss to go with that coffee, to sweeten it up," he laughed while patting the sofa. 

She groaned inwardly not wanting to make Jim that jealous. She couldn't help laughing with him though. It was partly the wine but he did have an infectious laugh and that cheeky grin meant he was teasing her, daring her. There was a certain charm about him that seemed irresistible. 

Sitting as far away as possible on the large sofa was meant to tell him she meant to resist that boyish charm. 

"If I guess the colour of your panties in one go, I get a kiss." He teased her. 

They were June's straight from a new pack so even she had to think about it. Standing before him her face flushed red with embarrassment. With both hands pulling at the hem for protection she smiled at the audacious remark trying to recover her composure. 

She knew the dress wasn't that short and at her age knew how to bend without revealing the panties. He was too old to play such a silly game but it did bring back memories of her youth with the boys at school. 

With a laugh she said, "You're on! Only one chance though. If you guess correctly you win a kiss," She laughed. 

"You're wearing a pink thong with little white hearts." He announced. "I claim my prize." 

This young man had again caught off guard leaving her in a state of breathless embarrassment. He patted the leather beside him but she just stood there. The challenge as well as the mischievous look was getting to her. She relented and sat close. "One kiss, that's all," she admonished him, wondering if the stern statement was for him or her. 

He wrapped his arms around her and brought his lips to hers. As soon as her bottom hit the leather she realised the back of the dress w tucked into the panties. She opened her mouth to complain, to utter the magic word, 'No!', only to find he took advantage. Not a youthful smacker but a prolonged teasing tender probing. 

"Let me up for air. Phew!" He moved in again giving her no chance to protest. This wasn't just a kiss it was raw passion. His fingers stroked her ears, his teeth bit her lips, his tongue roamed her mouth, and his lips caressed her neck. The sensations were everywhere at once, impossible to resist. 

She didn't even feel the front of the dress being opened, not even aware of his lips leaving her ears with the sensations still ringing her bells. It had been so long her auto switch had failed leaving her squishy. 

With a tongue licking her cleavage she began to muster the presence of mind to say no. When he nibbled on a nipple the word stuck in her throat emerging as a pathetic moan. She closed her eyes feeling too guilty to watch this young man eating her breasts; enjoying the thrilling sensations to much to resist. 

Se became aware of a tingling sensation on her thigh and closed her eyes tighter. It wasn't his fingers as they were massaging her breasts and pinching the swollen nipples. 

She opened her eyes in disbelief to see his tongue probing and explored her. She cried out the word in anguish, only to miss spelt it. "Yes! Oh Yes!" He had pressed against the right button. As she began to cum he sucked everything into his mouth to nibble upon her labia. 

She was kept hovering in flight wanting to land only an up draught of hot pleasure kept her soaring higher. She didn't hear her own voice crying out, "Let me cum. Please!" 

It was more than a probing exploring tongue now it was a hard cock filling her up. Manoeuvred onto his lap facing him she felt a hard large penis between her thighs. He held her by the hips thrusting in with her own weight bearing down ramming it up higher, higher and deeper. 

The feeling of fullness brought on a deep orgasm. Her legs clenched and unclenched in uncontrollable spasms. She held on to him as though trying to become one with him. He too held on tight squashing her face against his chest. Almost suffocating she gasped air. 

She kissed his chest, more like sucking it, holding him tight as they collapsed upon the sofa. His weight pressed her into the leather where she felt so much a part of him she was lost entirely, no longer an entity merely a part of him. 

She felt him shrivel inside and gripped him with muscles she hadn't realised were there not wanting it to leave her, not wanting to lose the special feeling of fullness. 

What had he done to her? She knew what they had done and didn't regret it but what had he done to her? How had she become so completely carried away? Gradually she became aware of the little mewling whimpering sounds she was making. 

"There, there, little pet," he said indulgently while stroking her hair. 

A small part of her mind felt it to be wrong but her body just wouldn't give up. The assault upon her senses had been so overwhelming she was reduced to this mindless lump of quivering flesh. 

"You're all mine. I want you to be mine. All mine. Every part of you is mine," he whispered in her ear. 

Watching her purr like a kitten he wondered at how her lust for him had inspired such passion in return. At that moment he wanted to hold her forever. He didn't think about love he thought about lust and what he wanted to do to her. It was a surprise to be so pleased that she had come with such abandon; it made him feel strong. 

The phone rang bringing her round to some sense of where she was. 

"It's for you I expect," he said casually. 

Reaching over for the phone she croaked the number into it. 

"It's me. I'm at my mothers," Jim stated intending a neutral tone. "I'm staying the night. I guess you'll be in a better mood tomorrow." 

"OK." She could hear the slight intake of breath from his surprise she hadn't told him to come home. 

She felt movement between her legs and a gentle probing. 'Bastard!' she thought. 

"What?" Jim asked. 

She must have spoken out load after all. "The wine, it's Italian, Bastion or something." She felt a hand gather a breast for a gentle weighing then a nipple squeezed. "Oh!" 

"You all right?" Jim asked. 

"Yes." She gasped, "Its cramp. I'm stretched awkwardly over the sofa," she moaned feeling Barry's fingers exploring her body. 

"I hope you haven't spilt wine on it," he grumbled. 

"No not wine." 

"What then?" 

'Just some young mans sperm that's all,' she felt like saying. "I'll have to go the cramps getting to me." 

"Just relax and let go," he told her. 

"Yes. OK. Relax and let go," she repeated. Barry pinched a nipple. "Oh!" 

"Rub it harder then," Jim told her. 

"Yes, rub it harder," she gasped. The young man behind her did. 

"I've got to come. I mean I've got to go," she pleaded and dropped the phone on its cradle. "Oh! Yes!" she repeated in a soft moan. The orgasm was less intense this time but just as enjoyable as it eased through her body. The sensations caressed her skin in waves of a gentle insistency. 

Sliding off the sofa she crawled away from him. "Just don't touch me. Let me recover this time." Susan pleaded. 

"Come here," he commanded and she crawled back to him. "That's a good slut. You enjoyed that didn't you?" 

She didn't want to say it, to admit it, but the words left her throat anyway. "Yes! It was lovely." He stroked her face and neck and rubbed her ears. She kissed his hand biting it, licking it, nuzzling it. 

Helping her up from the floor he held her a moment. 

"The coffee's cold, make another," he commanded in a deep strong voice. He sent her on her way with a smack to her bare bottom as the loose panties were falling about her knees. She retreated to the kitchen pulling them up as she went. 

She was finding the teasing lilt to his voice so very attractive and the deep commanding tone did something more devastating to her. She hurried off to obey, partly to escape him before he worked her up again. In the kitchen she pulled the dress together trying to pull out the creases while worrying what she was going to tell June. She remained feeling squishy, unable to shake it off, all the while hurrying to get back to him. 

It was embarrassing returning to the lounge not knowing what to say. She handed him a cup and the feel of his hand was electric. This was the excitement that had been missing from her life for far too long. No amount of wistful browsing through Sunday supplements full of exotic travel would do from now on. 

This was here and now. She was having wonderful elicit sex on the new lounge sofa. Jim didn't want to use the sofa and, she mused, he didn't want to use her either. She screwed up her face at the thought of being used. 

She meant to sit close to him on the precious sofa but he guided her by the hips to the floor at his feet. She sat with her back to him between his legs. He hadn't even taken off his trousers. He had casually unzipped and taken her. He massaged her head, her face, down her shoulders to her breasts. Gently, ever so gently his hands glided over the hot pliant skin inside the dress. 

When her nipples reacted he breathed in her ear. "You're such a slut. You're ready for it again. Tell me. Say it." 

Thankful he couldn't see the embarrassment on her face as she closed her eyes giving in to the crazy moment. "I'm a dreadful slut. I want you. I want it. I want you to fuck me." It felt liberating to say these naughty words, so much so she had become willing and able yet again. It was true, she wanted him and there was an edge of desperation to the need. 

He guided her head into his lap and his cock into her gaping mouth already gasping for air. She sucked and licked him and sucked the shrunken member into her mouth willing it to grow. Her capitulation was complete. He stroked the long black hair telling her she was beautiful that she was a great fuck. 

The thought of being used by this young man returned but she didn't care. Susan abandoned propriety and good sense thinking she was using him too. She continued sucking his cock with enthusiasm at last feeling it grow. 

On the floor on hands and knees she felt his hardness nudging, rubbing her clit. 'Oh! Hell! I need this so bad!' She thought, 'What am I doing?' A complete stranger had come into her home and had cum into her. She had given in so completely she was kneeling on their new carpet letting him tease her, desperately waiting for him to enter her. 

This time it was less frantic from the start. A gentle thrust took her. Without even time to recover from the last assault she was back there soaring on a high yet this time so much more aware of what was happening. 

It was naughty and exciting and raunchy and she wanted it. Susan wanted him to take her. She wanted to be his. She wanted him to do it to her and wanted it now. "Faster!" She panted. She felt every movement, the grip upon her hips, the pounding of their thighs, the hardness inside. "I'm coming!" They exhaled through clenched teeth. 

Lying back on the floor in a heap with their limbs entangled, she regained some composure, enough to open her eyes. He was looking at her with a sly smile upon his face. 

"You are my gorgeous slut," he declared. 

Instead of complaining over such an awful expression it sent a thrilling shiver down her spine. This young stranger had called her a slut and that was how he had treated her and how she had behaved. She didn't care. It was what she wanted for the moment. To be this handsome young mans slut and it felt so good. She was his sexy slut. That's how she felt and couldn't help revelling in it. 

"Bugger tomorrow let this night never end." Susan whispered. Report_Story
