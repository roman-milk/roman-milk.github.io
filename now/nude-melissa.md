Writer's note: 

All characters are over 18 years of age -- blah blah blah, etc. 

This is my entry into the Literotica Nude Day Contest 2013. It's an incest piece -- which is pretty obvious given the story category I submitted it to - - that begins with Melissa, Eammon, Julia and Ben heading off for a holiday in a caravan by the sea on the south coast of England. 

Ben, Melissa's boyfriend, much to her overbearing father's chagrin, accompanies the family. Julia, Eammon's wife, Melissa's mother, takes a shine to the young man ... and it goes on from there. 

It's a long piece at just over 40k words because I found had to draw out the seduction scenes in an attempt to at least preserve some degree of believability. That was my intent, to make it at least a little bit credible since, "Hi, Dad. Wow, that's a big cock, let's fuck. Hey, Mum, Dad's got a hard-on, it'd be a shame to waste it", just doesn't seem plausible to me ... Well, maybe on the Fens in the east of England that'd work, but... 

Anyway, I digress. 

I apologise for any errors that (almost certainly) remain in the text. I hope typos and gaping plot-holes don't detract too much from any enjoyment you may glean from my humble offering. I had a plan for the submission, but it went off at a tangent during the writing process as these things tend to do. 

As usual I'd appreciate feedback. This is significantly longer than anything I've submitted to Lit before and, since I usually write in the first person I'd also be interested to know how that went down. 

Feedback can be by public comment below, a PM to me directly or by email. If you want a response from me, email is best. 

Right, that's it. I'll shut up and leave it. I hope you enjoy the following. 

GA -- Calp, Spain -- 26th June 2013. 

Prologue 

Eammon 

Eammon Morgan's fingers tightened on the steering wheel when he flicked a glance at the rear view mirror and his eyes brushed over the young man sitting in the back seat. It wasn't that he disliked Ben, nobody could say he'd been impolite or hostile in his dealings with him, what he felt was the natural concern any father had for his daughter -- his darling Melissa. His princess. It didn't matter that the girl was all grown up. To Eammon, she was precious, and he intended to protect her from the world, from pain and heartbreak, as long as he had breath in his body. 

"Everything all right back there?" he called, and then threw a look over his shoulder to check on the gap between his daughter and her recently acquired boyfriend. 

Melissa's eyes rolled with theatrical exaggeration. She heaved an exasperated sigh and replied with, "Will you stop going on. How many times do you have to ask?" 

"It's all fine Mister Morgan," Ben interjected, flashing a white-toothed grin, the smile bright in his tanned face. 

"We should be there in half-an-hour," Eammon said, the light tone belying the inner turmoil he felt at the younger man's presence. He turned his attention back to the road, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling with suspicion at what could be going on behind him, only vaguely aware, as usual, of his wife in the seat beside him. 

Julia 

Julia Morgan stared out of the window with a blank expression papered over her face. She sat there unthinking, her mind simply drifting, bored with her husband, bored with her marriage, sick of her life and numbed at the prospect of yet another holiday, camping. 

And why-oh-why did he insist on Melissa coming too? He was a bully and bloody control-freak, that's why. A man so afraid to let his daughter go, a man too wrapped up in his work to notice that his wife was on the verge of a breakdown. 

Her husband was a selfish pig. Why couldn't he just listen to her? What was wrong with something different, something ... exciting? Julia fancied a safari holiday in Kenya, that's all. It wasn't like back-packing through Central America. It didn't even have to be that adventurous, she didn't need to see elephants and giraffe in the wild, Julia would be happy with a trip to Benidorm, anything but the same old thing: a week in a caravan by the sea. 

From the corner of her eye Julia saw Eammon swivel in his seat. She heard him speak to the couple in the back seat and listened to Ben's reply. 

At the thought of Ben Julia squirmed in her own seat, a flare of desire catching her by surprise. Now he was something special: tall, fit and good- looking, all tightly packed muscle -- nothing too overdone, just nicely proportioned and toned. 

Julia smiled at her reflection in the window a few inches from her face, glazed and vacant eyes focussing after gazing at the interminable motorway scene for what seemed an age. The holiday might not be too hideous for a change. At least this time there was the prospect of getting an eyeball full of a gorgeous young hunk in a pair of swimming shorts. 

Melissa 

She was determined that things would change. It was time to break out, to show her father that she was now a young woman, no longer a little girl. Melissa would always be his princess but she needed some space. 

It had been so difficult asking her father if Ben could join them on the holiday. She knew he'd come up with all kinds of reasons for not allowing Ben to join in, that he would bluster and make noises about it being family time, how he didn't spend enough time with Melissa and her mother, although he would blame work, as usual for that. 

There would be words about inconvenience and sleeping arrangements, she could just picture her father's mournful expression as he tried to guilt her about having just met Ben and was it wise to have him with them for such a condensed period. But, to her immense surprise Eammon had acquiesced when, in an uncharacteristic show of determination, Melissa had laid down her ultimatum: Either Ben comes with us or I'm staying at home. 

Her father had buckled, preferring the man's presence to leaving his precious daughter alone for ten days. There was no way Eammon was going to have her out of sight for that period. Alone with the new boyfriend on the scene? Not a chance. 

Melissa slid a look towards Ben, winking when she caught his eye. You okay? she mouthed, rolling her eyes towards the front of the car. 

Ben, following a quick check of the rear view mirror to make sure the old man had his eyes on the road, nodded, his lips forming the words, I want to lick your pussy. 

Melissa blinked and blew out her cheeks, a tingle of lust between her legs at the thought of Ben's tongue sliding over her clit. The girl allowed herself a quick reverie of the risky sex she'd enjoyed. She thought about how she'd been stood, her arms braced against the wall while Ben lifted her skirt and eased his cock into her from behind. The chance that her father could have walked in on them at any time had given Melissa such a thrill that she'd been forced to stifle her cries of pleasure by biting the web of one hand, her orgasm so intense that her clenching pussy had milked Ben's cock within a few strokes. 

She was looking forward to more of the same during the holiday: hot sex with Ben, the riskier the better. This newly discovered penchant for taking chances, especially risks fraught with the danger of her father catching her at it had the girl wondering which of her parents, if either, she took after. Somehow she couldn't see her uptight, domineering father being into it, and her mother - - so brittle and aloof these days (when had that happened?) -- would probably rather die than admit to the sex act even existing. 

Melissa knew that it hadn't always been that way between her mum and dad. She could remember her mother being pretty and vivacious. Melissa's opinion was that her mother still looked good; a bit plumper than the girl remembered. But on her mum it looked good, even Ben had dropped a comment about Julia's voluptuous curves. Melissa had feigned disgust when her boyfriend had made a quip about seeing Julia in a bikini, punching his arm and throwing back a pithy retort when, in actual fact, the thought of Ben ogling her mother had turned Melissa on. 

It might not be such a bad holiday after all. The only problems were her father's overbearing attitude, and his indifference towards his wife was deplorable, but, for herself, Melissa also hoped that having Ben with her on the holiday would finally make her father see that she had her own life to lead. Her mother could deal with her own shit. 

Ben 

He wanted to touch her, craved her lovely pudding-sized tits in his hands while he leaned in and sucked her nipples. The frustration was almost too much, made him crazy with desire, and Melissa's old man's constant observation was getting to him too. Not that he could blame Eammon, Ben could understand the bloke's attitude towards him. After all, Melissa was the man's daughter; she was gorgeous and desirable, a walking fantasy, and it couldn't be easy knowing that some randy squaddie had designs. Ben was sure that if he ever had a daughter, years in the future, that he'd be as suspicious and protective as Melissa's dad. 

But Ben was young and full of it and especially horny after six months in the Afghan with the Royal Artillery. Melissa had answered an ad in a magazine for forces pen-pals, and her letter had found him after four months in-country. 

Their correspondence had taken a predictable course: a couple of letters each way, tentative at first, with both of them shy at the strangeness of it before their confidence grew and they exchanged email addresses for quicker communication. 

The messages to-and-fro became ever more flirty until, as time went on and they grew, through words and photographs, to like each other more and more, the scenarios they conjured between them growing hotter and sexual, they arranged a meeting upon Ben's safe return. 

It went on from there. 

To Ben, even after the privations of six months away -- less several days R&R - - the girl was incredible. He'd been captivated by her at first sight, finding her even more attractive and sexy than any of the pictures he'd seen, and some of the images Melissa had sent were pretty close to the bone. She was slim, pretty, her hair reminiscent of Jennifer Aniston in one of those old episodes of Friends. Melissa's eyes, pale green, reminded him of a cat's, and he loved the way she stared at him when things were growing heated between. The girl's nose would crinkle as she offered her sly smirk, her eyes narrowing to slits while she did something to provoke him; something like cup her bare boobs and tease her own nipples, or sit in one of the deep armchairs in her parents' living room and flash her plump vulva while her father's back was turned. 

Ben saw that Melissa got her looks from her mother, and he wouldn't have minded giving Julia one -- if he wasn't already involved with her daughter, and, of course, if Julia wasn't already married to Melissa's father. The old bird had something about her that got him going: eyes the same green as Melissa's; the same shape with a slight slant. She had a nice set of knockers on her too, big and round with a lovely bum acting in counter-balance. Ben got a sense that Julia, like him, under different circumstances, might be interested in a taste of the forbidden. He'd caught a look from her once or twice. Seen something shift behind her eyes, noticed an odd look on her face. 

He looked out of the window at a plane coming in, low on its approach to Gatwick Airport as the car's tyres hummed along the surface of the M23 motorway. He pictured Julia -- again -- in a swimming costume, hopeful that she might even be brave enough for a bikini. He nodded internally, amused as he wondered briefly about the boys from the Battery who, at that moment, were scattered about the country, some away on the beaches in Greece, Spain, even Thailand, and what adventures they were having. 

Ben was happy enough; this could turn out to be a nice little holiday: a hot girl to fuck and a sexy older woman to look at as well. 

He looked up and caught Eammon Morgan's beady stare. Ben grinned and winked. "All right, Mister Morgan?" he asked, knowing that by playing the good guy would wind Melissa's father up all the more. 

The man said nothing, just grunted, and Ben settled down to a daydream that featured his girlfriend and her mother. 

Part One 

1 

On the first morning Julia woke up early. She boiled the kettle for her morning coffee and was sitting in one of the folding chairs, smoking an illicit cigarette, when Ben surprised her. 

Shirtless, Julia was quick to notice, the young man, at a low trot, obviously having been out for a run in shorts and training shoes, jogged along the track leading into the campsite from the dune behind her. 

After Ben had appeared so suddenly around the corner of the caravan, in the seconds before he noticed her, Julia took the opportunity to ogle the ridged outline of the man's abdomen, the plates of his muscled chest, those lovely arms and the long muscles of his thighs. 

When the young man saw Julia sitting there his face split into a smile, a cheeky grin that sent a pulse of desire through the woman. 

"Hello, Mrs Morgan," Ben began, making no effort to cover his torso. He was well aware of the effect he had on Julia, could see the hungry gleam in her eyes, and he thought it might be fun to give the old bird a bit of a thrill. Just tease her a little. "I didn't know you were a smoker." 

Julia grimaced and, Ben noticed, threw a contemptuous glance towards the caravan. He assumed the look was meant for her husband, he'd noticed there didn't seem to be much communication between Melissa's parents. No touches or smiles, not much talking either now he came to think of it. A small voice spoke to Ben, a quiet word of warning from inside about being very careful with Julia. Teasing her with his physical appeal, flirting with her ... it could get out of hand if the woman got the wrong idea. Not that it bothered him too much, but it was early days with Melissa and he wanted to have some fun with her before his leave was up. 

"Eammon disapproves." Julia took a drag and blew a viper's breath of thin blue smoke towards the blue morning sky. She rolled her eyes and added in a monotone, as though reading items from a very tedious list, "And I know it's bad for me, and I know it's anti-social and I'm a social pariah ... But I enjoy a cigarette with my morning coffee. I don't give a stuff what anyone says, I'm not hurting anyone but myself, so bugger the world." 

Ben eyed the woman with new respect. 

"Good for you, Mrs Morgan," he said, nodding. "I'm not a smoker myself, but like you said," he cast a look around the quiet site, no sign of life in any of the vans, "you're not hurting anyone." 

Julia sipped from the cup before looking up at the tanned Adonis, offering, "Would you like a coffee, Ben -- before everyone else wakes up?" It was an innocent invitation but what she meant really was Please stay and let me look at your lovely body. 

A glut of sexual arousal, thick and heavy, settled in the pit of Julia's stomach. Ben really was a spectacular animal. So bloody gorgeous. 

Disappointing Julia, Ben replied, "No thanks, Mrs Morgan. I'd better get a shower before I cool down too much. Don't want to get a cold." 

The croaked sentence was out there between them before Julia realised what she'd said. 

"If you want anyone to wash your back..." 

The woman's eyes widened when her own voce came back to her, wishing she could snatch back the words, thick, heavy bubbles from a throat swollen suddenly with desire. 

Her fingers came up to her mouth. 

"I'm sorry, Ben," she mumbled, horrified that she'd blurted such impropriety. But if she was so appalled, how come there was that insistent lub-lub between her legs? 

In the few seconds before Ben replied, in the way those moments do, Julia's fantasy stretched out in front of her, a soft-focus image of her and Ben under a shower spray; not the tiny cubicle in the mobile home, but in some anonymous suite in a luxury hotel somewhere exotic: Barbados or Cuba. 

Julia was soaping the man's broad back, savouring the springy texture of his abdomen when her arms encircled his body, her fingers moving lower to find the iron-hard length of his cock while his buttocks, taut and tiny, pressed against her. 

She imagined Ben turning, his dark hair wet, rivulets of water pouring over his face while he grinned at her, one hand lifting her leg and, while she sat in the chair outside the caravan, Julia swallowed the real-life gasp that threatened to burst out of her when her fantasy body opened to accept the relentless invasion of Ben's erection. 

In her mind they fucked with neither finesse nor regard for the other's needs. Their coupling, almost vicious in its clutching, gasping intensity, was more a desperate effort by Julia to achieve a long-awaited climax, a drive for pleasure that she hadn't experienced for so long. 

Real-life came rushing back when Ben spoke. 

"Don't be sorry, Mrs Morgan ... If it wasn't for Mel, and Mister Morgan I don't think I'd mind you doing that too much." 

Those words and the breath upon which they were delivered sent a shiver along Julia's spine; she felt as though Ben's fingers had brushed her bare skin with a touch like a sigh. She felt her insides melt with warmth, the pulse blooming to a full-blown throb. 

Strong emotions, the reawakening of a deep yearning for physical fulfilment, overwhelmed Julia. She stared at the man standing in front of her, and with her mind empty to thoughts of her husband and daughter, carried away with the desire to be touched by Ben's fingers, to feel his tongue sliding into her mouth, to taste him and savour the feeling of having him deep inside her, she mumbled, "Oh God, Ben, do you mean you want me to do that? Would you like me to wash your back ... under the shower? Both of us together?" 

Knowing it was a stupid thing to do and with total disregard to that little voice telling him he was playing with fire, Ben still replied with, "I wouldn't mind that at all, Mrs Morgan." He let his eyes move over Julia's body, his tongue moving over his lips as he appreciated the swellings in the woman's tee- shirt. Ben paused, allowing his meaning to filter past Julia's surprised face and into her brain. When the flicker of understanding reached the woman's eyes he added, "As long as I get to wash your back, too." He hoped his expression conveyed the message that he would happily soap Julia's lush body all over, especially those big titties. 

Julia blinked and allowed the cigarette to drop from her fingers. She looked down at the smouldering butt and, without really registering what she was doing, in an automatic action born out of habit, crushed it beneath the sole of her flip-flop. The chair creaked, its aluminium frame protesting as Julia rose to her feet. 

"Are you playing with me?" the woman murmured, face questioning as she tilted her head to one side and looked into Ben's eyes. 

"A little," Ben admitted, swallowing in guilty response to Julia's percipient question. He nodded and threw a furtive look at the caravan. "I mean, there's Melissa and Mister Morgan..." He grimaced when he saw Julia wince at the reminder of the realities, immediately regretting starting the game. 

"Oh, Ben--" 

But the young man didn't find out what Julia intended to say next, not since the caravan door opened and Eammon's foot plonked onto the two-tier metal frame that served as steps below the door. 

"Have you been smoking?" Eammon greeted Julia, his lip curling after he sniffed the air and eyed the flattened dog-end. He shifted his attention to Ben, eyes narrowing as he took in the man's bare torso and a flicker of jealousy soured in his guts. 

While Eammon's mind dealt with the repugnant possibility that his daughter found the tanned oaf attractive, he missed the moment his wife took a step backwards with a decidedly guilty look on her face.  

===

"You know what, Eammon," Julia began, frustration and resentment bubbling inside her when she recovered from her husband's abrupt arrival. "Stop being such a supercilious wanker. I'm forty-three for God's sake. If I want a cigarette, I'll bloody well have one. It isn't as though you care about me, is it? It's just that you can't control me. That's the fucking truth of it." 

And, with her cheeks burning with bitterness and the beginnings of embarrassment at her outburst in front of Ben, ire burning inside her, Julia pushed past her gape-mouthed spouse and stomped into the caravan. 

"I'll be off for a shower," Ben said, nudging his head towards the brick building at the edge of the camp that housed the ablutions. He supressed a smirk when, through the sheeted aluminium wall of the mobile home, came the sounds of Julia thumping around inside the mobile home. "See you later, Mister Morgan," he added, turning his back to walk away towards his tent, the little domed bivouac being a condition Eammon had set down for Ben's inclusion on the trip. 

I'm not having a single man in his twenties in the van with you a step away. 

Eammon had been adamant on the point, which Melissa, during the battle of words and wills between father and daughter, had to concede was reasonable enough. Losing one battle didn't necessarily mean the war was over. 

He can eat with us but there'll be no sleeping or showering. I don't want him poncing around with a towel around his waist. Not in my caravan. 

Ben stuck his head into the tent and grabbed a towel and his wash kit, his mind full of Julia Morgan as he walked away, leaving the woman's husband staring at his back. 

2 

Appreciation for his girlfriend's figure swelled Ben's cock when, with him behind Melissa as they approached the crest of the dune between the camp site and beach, he ogled the slim lines of her bare back and rounded buttocks. The girl had appeared at the flap of his tent and suggested a walk along the beach, her grin and the sparkle in her eyes conveying her intent: Melissa wanted mischief. 

"Shit," Ben had muttered when he encountered her after crawling headfirst out of his tent. Melissa stood there wearing faded denim shorts and bikini top, the ragged hem of the Daisy Dukes high on her thighs. "You look fucking gorgeous." 

Melissa had smirked and nodded. "I thought my dad was going to keel over when he saw me." 

"He's just trying to protect you from randy blokes," had been Ben's reply, his gaze roaming over Melissa's torso. He stared at the soft midriff, the rack of her ribcage and her breasts, high and tight and presented like gifts in the hot pink bikini bra. 

Melissa, giving her habitual eye roll, something she did often in response to any mention of her father's irritating concerns for her, responded with a contemptuous, "Whatever," and, with a jerk of her head towards the rear of the camp, added, "Let's go to the beach." She nodded at the cotton bag by her feet, one of the kind that supermarkets sell as a 'bag for life'. "Grab the bag, Ben. It's got a couple of beach towels and a bottle of water in it." 

When Ben suggested he would just pull on a tee-shirt Melissa scoffed and told her boyfriend to come as he was, and so Ben shrugged and picked up the bag, he didn't mind either way. 

Melissa slipped on her sunglasses and led the way across the caravan park. In the few seconds it took the couple to climb to the top of the dune, took in the gentle curves of his girlfriend's body. 

Melissa looked great from behind, and Ben was forced to supress the urge to grab her around her narrow waist and pull her down into the sand. He gulped down the impulse with a heavy swallow, resisting the lure of the girl's rolling hips and denim-clad arse. He even found the knobbed ridge of the girl's spine arousing. 

When they arrived at the apex of the ridge they came to an abrupt halt, Ben muttering a curse at the sight of the packed beach, bodies everywhere with barely any sand visible. 

Melissa surveyed right and left, one hand to her forehead in a salute, shielding her eyes, despite the sunglasses she wore, from the sun. The crowds on the beach didn't bother her at all; she just wanted to get away from her parents. Ben had told her about the morning's altercation and Melissa was sick of her dad's bad mood, his ever watchful eye and her mother's sulking. 

With a squeeze of Ben's hand, Melissa said, "Let's explore along the track. We might find somewhere we can be alone." She pressed her body close to his and whispered, "I'm really fucking horny, Ben." 

Ben looked at her, taking in the swellings of her breasts, the long legs and training shoes. He licked his lips and gave the entire length of girl an appreciative scan. 

"Somewhere I can get you out of those shorts?" he suggested with a leer. "I wouldn't mind giving your pussy a good licking, Mel." He leaned in and murmured into Melissa's ear, "And then I'll fuck you rigid. All that time in the Afghan, looking at those pictures of you ... I lost count of the number of times I pulled my cock thinking about your sweet cunt." 

Goosebumps rose on Melissa's arms at the revelation. She wasn't averse to a bit of the dirty talk, and Ben's profanity had aroused her passion even more. 

"I want to watch you wank," she breathed. "Out here somewhere. There has to be somewhere we can go to get away from my mum and dad." The sweep of Melissa's arm encompassed the beach. "And all of these people," she added before focussing her attention on Ben. "I want us to be together, both of us naked." She smiled into his face. "Wouldn't it be fantastic to be nude? I'd love to do it outside on a day like this. It'd be great to feel the sun warming me while I sit on your big cock." 

The prospect of stripping out of her shorts and exposing herself to the sun's kiss thrilled Melissa. She found the idea of al-fresco sex so daring, such a turn-on that she shivered despite the warmth of the afternoon. 

"That idea really gets me going. I'm so hot down there, Ben," Melissa murmured, tilting her face up for her boyfriend's kiss. She gave the front of Ben's shorts a rub with the palm of one hand while their tongues danced. 

Ben's groan broke the kiss and they parted, both of them breathing hard, lust ignited. 

Melissa gasped, "I want your hard cock, Ben." She blushed and tilted her face away, embarrassed to utter the word in front of Ben for the first time. "I want your big, hard cock in my little cunt." To mask her embarrassment Melissa grabbed Ben's hand. "Come on," she mumbled, turning her face from Ben's leer as she tugged him down the slope towards the beach. "Let's find somewhere ... Quick." 

With excitement coursing through him in hope of making the girl moan with his tongue, anticipating the taste of her and how she would feel clenching around his cock, Ben allowed himself to be dragged away. 

For a few hundred yards they hurried along a rough track between the beach and the dune, their course parallel to the shore. There were people in the water and sunbathers of varying shades of colour -- blue-white to mahogany - - sprawled on towels and beach mats like survivors of some maritime disaster. Families with fractious children squatted with territorial determination and eyed their close neighbours with suspicion, ready to protest at the slightest threat to their borders. The young lovers ignored them all, too intent in their search for a clandestine spot to take in any detail of the crowd. 

Melissa halted and nudged Ben with an elbow. 

"How about we take a look up there?" 

Ben followed a line indicated by the girl's pointing finger. He cast a disdainful look at the melee on the shore before nodding, replying with, "It's got to be better than this." 

They set off towards the break in the dune, and when the cacophony receded immediately, the bank of sand and scrub acting as a baffle between them and the beach, Melissa grinned. 

"This is more like it," she said, and then hurried after Ben who had moved quickly ahead. 

The couple hurried along the rough path, the straggly vegetation on either side giving rise to denser, lush greenery, bushes with a firmer grip on the soil. Soon enough they came across a smaller track, an almost invisible tributary to the main path which led deeper into the undergrowth. 

When it seemed they were completely alone, having not encountered another soul after breaking away from the beach, Ben paused and kissed Melissa, the bag dropping from his fingers. 

"What do you think?" Melissa whispered, her breath quickening, her ardour flaring between her thighs. She moaned when Ben grinned and nodded, his hand gliding over the skin of her waist. Melissa pressed her body into Ben, rotating her hips as she ground her pubis against his muscled thigh. 

It was Ben's turn to groan. 

"Mel..." He grimaced and sighed, eyes rolling when Melissa tugged at his shorts and her fingers curled around his erection. "I want to fuck you, Mel. God, I want to stick it into you and fuck." 

Melissa's grin widened as she jacked her fist along the length of hard cock. 

"I want you to fuck me with this," she breathed, her thumb smearing gooey pre- cum over the blunt head. "Out here, both of us naked. I want to get on my knees and suck your cock." 

The enforced abstinence of an operational tour in Afghanistan meant that having a gorgeous, sexy and willing young woman was something of a novelty to Ben, an enhancement to the pleasure he already experienced since that girl was also tugging his cock. Ben was moaning and sighing and gasping. He felt the tingle of an oncoming orgasm and knew he was about to let loose with a deluge of semen. 

"Not here," Ben managed to croak. "It's too public." He grabbed Melissa's hand and forced her to release his member. "Anyone could walk past and catch us." 

Laughing at her boyfriend's guttural grunt, Melissa's fingers snatched at him. 

"That's even more fun. Getting caught. I'd love to have someone watch me fucking. I wouldn't care." She looked around at their secluded enclave. "Don't be such a wuss. I thought you were a big, brave soldier? Come on, nobody's going to just walk in here and catch us. They all head for the beach." 

Ben gulped when Melissa's hand began working at him again. He let it go, capitulating to the overwhelming sensations, allowing himself to be convinced by Melissa's assurances that it was unlikely they'd be disturbed. Besides, the idea of some voyeur spying on them while they fucked was a horny thought, one which caused arousal to surge through him. Ben looked down to see his girth caught in Melissa's fist, the size of her hand, her small and finely boned fingers making his dick appear huge. 

The rush began and Ben's toes curled inside his training shoes while spurt after spurt of semen squirted out of him to plop in a heavy rain into the sand at his feet. 

"Oh! Melissa yelped. "Look at what I've done." Her hand continued to work. "Come for me, Ben. That's making me so hot. Seeing it coming out like that. Is It good? Does it feel good?" 

Ben could only respond with a grunt and a nod. 

"I've never done it outside before, Ben," Melissa blurted, excitement evident in her squeak. "It feels so lovely out here. I feel so ... free." 

In the heat of his climax Ben gasped and moaned and pulled Melissa close by hooking an arm around her waist. He kissed the girl, groaning into her open mouth as her hand slowed and she milked the last dribble from his cock. Then, after pulling herself free of the tight grip around her body, Melissa shrugged out of her shorts and reached to the nape of her neck to tug at the knot of the bikini top. 

"Nude, outdoors," Melissa said after unclasping the strap that ran around her back. She flashed a grin at the man staring at her. "It's gorgeous to be naked outside." The girl's eyes shone with desire when she slipped her sunglasses up into her hair and smiled at her boyfriend. "You, too, Ben. Get naked with me." 

The sight of his girlfriend standing there with her hands on her hips, head tilted, the challenge evident in her stare and the jut of her jaw, had Ben nude in seconds. A simple matter of, as it had been for Melissa, of yanking down his shorts and stepping out of them. 

The man's cock waggled, a heavy jib that remained semi-erect when he reached into the bag and hauled forth a bright beach towel. 

The towel snapped open with a flick of Ben's wrists. 

"Lie down," he growled, indicating the makeshift bed with a flourish. "Open your legs. Let me see your pussy." 

Melissa felt her insides melt, her tummy flipping with a greasy mix of shame and delicious anticipation as she lay back and allowed her legs to fall apart. She felt so vulnerable and exposed, her cheeks burning with the knowledge that Ben could see all of her. 

"This is so humiliating," Melissa murmured. But her actions belied her words as she hauled herself up onto her elbows. She craned her neck to examine the front of her body, excitement bubbling at her opening when she lifted her feet from the ground and spread her thighs wider. "You can see all of me, can't you, Ben?" 

The man stared at Melissa's core for a few seconds before he lifted his heavy- lidded stare to her eyes. His fist worked along his length. "Open yourself," Ben croaked, his voice hoarse. "With your fingers. Open your cunt and show me." 

A pang of desire twisted and rolled in the girl's stomach. This was the most daring she'd ever been in her life. She couldn't quite believe it of herself but, nevertheless, there she was, reclining on a beach towel while a gorgeous man fisted his own length and stared at her. Ben's glazed eyes, his face slack, almost idiotic, spurred her to move her hand between her thighs and use her fingers to splay the folds of her labia. 

Melissa moaned when, at an almost incomprehensible grunted instruction from Ben, she slid the tip of a forefinger into her opening. She collapsed back onto the towel and rubbed the moistened fingertip over the nub of her clit, moaning and gasping at the burst of pleasure. 

"Rub it," Ben groaned, his fist working faster in response to the sight of his girlfriend's twisted expression. "You're fucking beautiful, Mel." 

He took it all in: Melissa gnawing her bottom lip as she moaned in delight. He watched her stomach tense with effort, her breasts heaving while she gasped and sighed, fingers describing quick, urgent circles in the mush of her vulva. 

When Ben felt the beginnings of his second surge he released his dick. It wouldn't do to come again, not so soon, and not before he'd given Melissa what she wanted. He stepped onto the towel and, after gazing at the girl for a few seconds, just soaking up the image of her, knelt between her legs. 

"Ben..." Melissa breathed when the man eased her hand away from her body and his face moved to her sex. 

The girl's climax rolled in fast, a tidal wash brought on by a combination of being naked outdoors and her lover's tongue lapping at her clit. The relentless pressure of Ben's licking took Melissa to a gasping orgasm. She clawed at the towel, bunching the heavy cotton in her fingers while babbling an incomprehensible flood of words. She came up onto her elbows again, eyes slits, the cords in her neck as defined as knife blades as she hissed with appreciation and craned to watch the man working at her sex. 

"Put it in," Melissa grunted, finally regaining the ability to speak, her face twisted into a grimace. "Fuck me, Ben. Hard ... Fuck me hard. Pound my pussy." 

He was inside her in an instant, fucking into Melissa with robust strokes, the backs of the girl's knees hooked around his forearms. 

Ben, holding himself above Melissa on straight arms, her pubis at his mercy, stared down at the girl, drilling deep into her body, the head of his cock probing at her. 

"I'm going to split you in two," Ben snarled, lust flaring inside him. If she wanted it hard and fast he would give it to her that way, he had months of it stored up and now there was the opportunity to let her have it. "You want fucking hard, do you? You want your pussy drilling?" 

"As hard as you want." Melissa's hips moved and she thrust up to meet Ben's downward stroke. 

Their bodies slapped together, both of them working hard at each other, both intent on proving a point. 

Ben's eyes rolled in their orbits before he glared down at the girl. 

"Move your arse. Fuck that pussy onto my cock." 

"Fuck my pussy, Ben. Drill my cunt. Come on. Get me there. Ride the fucking arse off me," Melissa spat back immediately, her breasts trembling with the vehemence thrust of her hips back-and-forth. 

They rutted with barely constrained violence for a minute or two, only stopping when Melissa squealed out her desire to change position. When Ben withdrew, as he rocked back on his haunches and swallowed great gulps of air, Melissa rolled onto her side and hauled herself up onto all fours. She presented her rear to Ben, her hips rocking from side-to-side. 

"From behind. Do it to me that way." 

He was back at her a second or two later, the cock-head nudging into Melissa's body. 

The girl gasped, turning her head to face Ben, squinting back at him over one shoulder. 

"That's good," she breathed, her voice curdled with lust. "I'm going to get there, Ben. Like this; I'll come his way." 

Melissa felt so tiny, her slim body writhing as Ben encircled her waist with one arm and leaned over her back. He cupped one breast in his palm, savouring the texture of firm, plaint flesh while her insides clenched around his girth. 

He listened to the girl babble, a disjointed litany, the words spilling out of her. 

"Naked ... Outside ... Fucking outdoors ... Oh, fuck, that's a lovely cock. I love it. I love it all. The sun ... Nude..." 

"Mel," Ben grunted. "I'm going to..." He gasped and hissed, leaning away from Melissa, his back bending, fingers digging into the girl's hips. 

"Me too," Melissa moaned, her buttocks slapping against Ben's abdomen. She pressed her palms into the towel, the ground beneath allowing her to thrust back onto the length of living gristle that touched some place deep inside her body. 

Melissa reached back with one hand to finger her clit, rubbing herself to a climax. 

They came simultaneously, Ben groaning, his eyes squeezed tight while the semen squirted out of him in bursts, his jizm flooding Melissa. 

The girl fell forward, unable to support herself on a single arm. She grunted and moaned as her fingers worked at her clitoris and viscous ooze slid from her opening, her climax rolling on and on. 

Ben grabbed himself and tugged, his eyes fixed on Melissa as she writhed and squirmed on the towel, his jaw slack with amazement. 

With their attention focussed purely on their own pleasure, naturally intent on their individual thoughts, emotions and responses, neither Ben nor Melissa noticed the man hidden in the undergrowth. Even in the aftermath, as their ardour cooled, they failed to see or hear him crawl away, both unaware that their intense coupling had been witnessed. 

Eammon Morgan, his chest heaving with emotion, thoughts tumbling inside his head, scrambled away from the scene. It wasn't until he was sure he was far enough away to remain unheard that he finally allowed himself to suck in great draughts of air, deep sobs wracking his chest while he struggled to come to terms with what he'd witnessed. What was worse for Eammon, even more disturbing than seeing his daughter with ... with ... him, was the reaction from his own body. He was stiff, his cock iron hard with desire for his daughter. 

3 

With Melissa and Ben away on their walk, and with Eammon disappearing soon after the couple had left, Julia Morgan decided to make the most of her unexpected time alone. The caravan, spacious as it was being at the upper end of the scale, wasn't exactly conducive to what she called her "quiet time". She was a moaner, very vocal when it came to fucking and the label of quiet time wasn't exactly correct. With an ironic grin Julia considered whether "alone time" might be more appropriate. After all, she'd been left to her own devices for so long Julia had given up on Eammon. She'd considered starting an affair but, as yet, hadn't had the nerve. But Ben's arrival on the scene had caused her to reconsider.  

===

Not that she meant to seduce her daughter's boyfriend, not that, but the way he'd looked at her -- not to mention the things they'd said that morning -- had given Julia a kick in the backside. She needed to do something, and soon. 

She settled herself on the bed with a glass of wine on the nightstand and the vibrator next to her. Julia let her thoughts wander and she drifted away, thoughts of Ben and what might have been if Eammon hadn't blundered out of the caravan and interrupted. 

A picture of the young man sprang to mind and Julia compared him to her husband, the man whose libido seemed to have taken a steep downward curve in the last few months. The thought came to her that Eammon might be embroiled in an affair of his own, but was surprised to find that she didn't give a shit either way. 

Naked, Julia spread her legs and stroked her thighs, savouring the sensations of her fingers on the silky flesh at the top of her legs. She squeezed her breasts together and called to mind another image of Ben as she'd seen him after his run. 

"Squeeze my tits," Julia sighed, and suddenly, in her fantasy, Ben was handling her boobs, his fingers massaging them, fingers tweaking her nipples. "Suck them," she breathed, one hand snaking down along her body towards her sex. "Oh, Ben, lick me. Lick me there, baby. Lick my pussy." 

The urgent desire surged through Julia with a speed that had her gasping and writhing, her fingers moving over her clit, the young, good-looking man fixed in her head. Her first orgasm hit her with such a force that Julia had to pause for a few moments, chest heaving while she sucked in air, her eyes blinking with shock and surprise at the vehemence of her climax. 

Breathing heavily, almost sobbing with urgency, Julia hefted herself up onto one elbow and reached for the vibrator. Then, with the faux penis buzzing angrily, the pitch of the vibrations rising and falling depending on whether Julia had just the tip at her opening or the whole length of the thing stuffed inside her body, she fucked herself with the dildo, crying out and moaning at the delight her quiet time brought her. 

It was a frenzied attack on her own pussy, with all the frustrations of previous weeks and months boiling inside her. Julia writhed and squirmed and grunted, desperate for another climax as she imagined Ben's cock in place of the vibrator. 

"Fuck," Julia snarled, her eyes squeezed tight, teeth bared in a snarl of agonised lust. "Fuck that pussy. Fuck it. Get me there. Fuck me with that big cock." 

The sensations rose within her, a rising tide whose wave swelled as Julia took herself closer and closer. Just as the wave began to crest, in the moments before her senses were flooded with the overwhelming power of her orgasm, with a blurt of sheer delight bubbling behind her teeth Julia opened her eyes and saw, with a cold water slap of shock, her husband standing in the doorway to the bedroom. 

"Eammon!" Julia sat bolt upright, eyes and mouth wide with surprise at the unexpected presence. 

The man stared at his wife for a few seconds, his eyes flicking between her legs to the vibrator, its latex-sheath moulded to resemble a ridged and veiny erection, hanging out of her opening. The dildo mocked him like an obscene tongue, with two-thirds of the thing still buried inside Julia, the remaining portion glistening with her arousal. 

The impressions hit him at once: Julia's labia, the neat lips clinging to the sides of the vibrator; her soft, rounded tummy; heavy breasts rolling when she moved; the stunned expression on her face and, of course, the woman's facial resemblance to her daughter. 

Eammon winced at the vivid recollection of Melissa's nudity, struggling to push the obscene desire his daughter's nakedness engendered. It was wrong to lust after her, so wrong. The girl was his daughter. For Christ's sake, Melissa was his own flesh and blood! The very thought was morally reprehensible, a sin of the most outrageous kind. 

But as he looked at his wife, a mature, fleshier woman of voluptuous curves where Melissa was less rounded, her breasts not as full as her mother's, Eammon saw the strong likeness between the two. His cock thickened and grew; a sudden imperative that he couldn't ignore. 

"Eammon?" Julia murmured when, after witnessing the brief internal struggle, the signs of which flickered across the man's face, she recognised a twist of lust in his features. "Oh my God ... Eammon?" 

Julia swallowed and shifted her rump on the bed. Could this be? Did he want her? Is that what she read in his expression? 

Already aroused by her masturbatory fantasies, Julia leaned back against the headboard and opened her legs. The dildo slid out of her and lay there, nestled between her thighs as she opened her arms in invitation to her husband. 

"Julia," Eammon gasped. He took a single awkward step towards the bed while, in his head, he fought against a barrage of images of Melissa. 

"Are you coming to bed?" Julia whispered and, with her libido aflame, a furnace burning between her legs, lewd images of Ben still fresh in her head, the woman invited her husband into her. "Come on, Eammon. It's been so long. Come here and make love." 

Eammon kicked off his flip-flops and shrugged out of his shorts. He was moving towards the supine woman as he yanked his shirt over his head. 

Julia saw Eammon's erection and let out a yelp of glee. He was big and hard, his dick stiff, all thick and angry with desire. The vibrator was consigned to the floor beside the bed and Julia opened her legs wider. 

But, when she felt her husband slip inside, it was a picture of Ben's cock that Julia kept in mind. 

4 

On the fourth night of the holiday they went to a pub for dinner. The place was just beyond the main entrance to the camp site, convenient since it meant that Eammon didn't have to concern himself with drink driving laws. They walked in and, as usual, Eammon took charge, guiding his wife and daughter towards a table while Ben came along behind. 

"What's the matter with you two?" Melissa asked when the four of them had settled at the table and a girl had taken their drinks order. 

Julia, whose attention had been focussed entirely on Ben's proximity, the lovely boy sitting next to her with his leg, a lovely lean thigh within touching distance, startled. She flicked a guilty look at her daughter, cheeks reddening. 

"Nothing," she replied, her eyes sliding away from Melissa's appraisal before casting a venomous look towards her husband. Following their coupling Eammon had returned to his previous state of apparent indifference towards his wife, and despite her head being filled with Ben while her husband filled her body, Julia was miffed. 

Eammon's sneering response snatched his daughter's attention away from her mother. 

"Why should there be anything the matter?" he said, teeth clenched. 

Eammon threw a pointed look at Ben and then stared at Melissa, his belligerence palpable. 

Melissa rolled her eyes. "Sorry," she said, the single word managing to convey her exasperation while she wondered what the hell that look was about. 

Her parents would drive her to distraction. She could happily kill them both. Then the frustration at her father's controlling ways spilled over. Just what was wrong with him now? Why was he acting like such an arse around Ben? So far, a far as she could tell, Ben had behaved impeccably around her dad. 

"Bloody hell, Dad, I was only asking. You've been a pain since day one. And you," Melissa turned to her mother, "you're just as bad." The girl shrugged. "Not as miserable as him," she tossed her head at her father, "but you've been so fucking long-faced for months. I'm sick of the pair of you." 

The silent animosity that mushroomed around the group lingered like a fart, hanging around even when the waitress returned with a tray of drinks. 

"Really," Melissa continued when the girl moved away with a promise to come back for the food order in a few minutes. "I'm right pissed off with it all." She rounded on her father, her face flushed with unspent fury. "You ... I'm sick of you trying to control me like I'm a little girl." Like an impatient thoroughbred Melissa tossed her head. "I'm eighteen, Dad. I've got a boyfriend." Melissa's hand moved over the table to clasp Ben's fingers. She flashed a smile at the young man, apologising with her eye and, emboldened by her boyfriend's presence, taking strength from his solidity, continued with, "This is the last time I'm coming away with you two. Next time I go on holiday, I'm going with Ben." 

Three pairs of eyes turned towards Julia when, from the flank, attacking her husband while he was still reeling from his daughter's outburst, she snarled, "She's right, Eammon. You've turned into a complete arsehole." Julia slid an opportune glance at Ben. "Sorry, Ben," she added. "You must think we're all complete maniacs." She regarded her husband again, expression baleful. "But I've about had it with you, Eammon. You've ignored me for ... for months." Her mouth opened and closed, tears welling as Julia struggled with her emotions. "Melissa's right. You're a demanding, controlling pig. You've been near me once!" The woman held up a hand with one index finger raised. She waved the finger close to her husband's slack face. "Just once ... In months! And now you're just acting like a twat again. Same old Eammon." 

"I think you're both overreacting..." Eammon managed, casting cast an anxious look around the pub. 

That response, the gall of the man, enraged Julia and, with a snort of derision and a vehement shake of her head she rose to her feet. 

"Fuck you, Eammon," the woman sobbed. She stared at her husband for several long seconds, her chin shivering. Julia's mouth opened and closed a few times before, overcome with feelings so complex and devastating she knocked her chair backwards and fled. 

"Isn't anyone going to go after her?" Ben asked when Eammon and Melissa just sat there. 

Eammon shrugged and avoided Ben's eye, fiddling with the cutlery laid out in front of him. 

"Don't look at me," Melissa snapped. "It's his fault." The girl thrust her chin at her father. 

Ben sighed and stood up. "I'll go then, shall I?" 

It wasn't his business but he couldn't let Julia just run away like that. She was obviously upset and probably needed someone to unload on. He looked at Eammon, disgust twisting his mouth as he decided he didn't want to be around the man any more. 

"You coming?" he offered to Melissa. 

The girl shook her head and said, "Nope. I can't be arsed." 

Ben hesitated for a fraction of a second before he gave a deep sigh and walked out of the pub. 

He found Julia on the dune behind the campsite, smoking as she stared out at the dark wallow of the water. 

"Oh, Ben, I'm so sorry," Julia blurted when the young man plonked himself beside her. She cuffed at her eyes. "You must be appalled at all that." 

"Don't worry about me Mrs Morgan. I just came to see if you're all right. Families, eh?" 

They sat side-by-side for a few minutes, with Julia smoking her mind drifting with the romance of the setting, nicotine and the soft susurration of waves breathing out in the darkness soothing her frayed nerves. 

There she was, with her fantasy lover, the tide sighing while a pale sickle of moon hung above. Ben was right next to her, the young man she'd yearned for over the last few days. 

Her body reacted to his presence: nipples and clitoris throbbing, breasts aching for his touch. She felt herself warming between her legs, knew she was moistening, her sex oiling in preparation for loving. 

Julia sighed at the futility. Ben was Melissa's boyfriend and Julia herself was married to Eammon. The young man in her head was nothing but a fantasy for her, a pleasurable interlude, a distraction and a temporary escape from a marriage gone stale. 

She flicked the half-smoked cigarette onto the sand. "Will you walk with me, Ben? Along the beach?" 

Ben nodded and, without a word stood up. He looked down, surprised when Julia's hand grasped his as they walked along the strip of deserted sand. 

"Am I attractive, Ben?" Julia asked, halting and turning to face the young man. "Honestly, be truthful. Am I?" 

Ben felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. His breathing quickened and he experienced a stirring of interest down below. This was dangerous territory. He sensed the woman's desire but also recognised her sadness. He was immediately reminded of the conversation they'd had on the first morning of the holiday. Ben knew he should just mutter some platitude and make an excuse to leave. Julia was obviously distraught, vulnerable after her husband's lack of attention and his callous attitude. Hadn't she accused him of only being near her once in months? 

He was surprised to hear the deep rumble of his own voice, a thick, treacly glut of lust in his tone when he replied with, "I think you're very attractive, Mrs Morgan." Ben's cock swelled against the confines of his cargo pants when he chanced to look down into the deep, vertiginous crease of Julia's cleavage. "You're really sexy," he added. 

"I think you're sexy, too," Julia breathed, hope and yearning rising in her voice. She moved square on to the good-looking young man, her face tilted as, suddenly reckless with the flare of her body's hunger, she offered herself to him. "I ... I've been thinking about you," the woman stuttered, blinking. "I've been thinking about you a lot. I've been dreaming about..." Julia's tone fell to a whisper, "...kissing you." 

"Mrs Morgan," Ben muttered, the last of his restraint slipping away, lost in that seductive crevice between Julia's breasts. Then guilt stabbed at him. "But what about Mel? I ... I'd like to kiss you, too, Mrs Morgan ... But what about Melissa? What about your husband?" 

The woman's face twisted at the mention of Eammon, and despite a twinge at the thought of Melissa, Julia's overwhelming emotion was anger. "Don't mention him, Ben." Julia winced and held up a hand, palm outwards. "And can't you just forget about Melissa for a few minutes? Can't we both just forget about both of them? I'm so fucking lonely, Ben. I know I shouldn't feel like this about you, but I do. I'm lonely and longing to be kissed." She pressed her body against Ben's torso. "I'm dying for than a kiss, too, Ben..." 

It was too much for the young man. The certainty that Julia, ripe and voluptuous would open her legs for him guided his actions from that point on. As pretty and as lovely as Melissa was, he'd only known her for a couple of weeks. She'd been a great pen-pal, a real emotional crutch during the months away, but she wasn't the love of his life and he wasn't going to turn down the opportunity to ride the arse off a sexy bitch like Julia Morgan. 

He took Julia to the secluded spot he'd found with Melissa, part of him already boasting to the boys back at the barracks. A mother and daughter? They'd never believe him, the boys would laugh and accuse him of being full of shit. 

They were at each other as soon as Ben dragged Julia into the enclave. Julia found herself encircled by a pair of strong arms, Ben's tongue invading her mouth, his erection pressed against her body. She returned the kiss, panting into Ben's mouth in her eagerness. 

They broke apart, both breathless as they eyed each other like combatants in some hand-to-hand duel. Ben moved close and slid the bootlace straps of Julia's dress over her shoulders. 

The woman blinked and gathered the bodice at her bosom. 

"Let it go," Ben said, his voice rumbling low and dangerous. 

Suddenly unsure, the insecurity nothing to do with any thoughts for her husband or daughter, more to do with concern for her body image, Julia held the loose front of her dress against her breasts. "Are you sure you want to see me, Ben?" 

The young man's stare burned into Julia's face for a moment. He grinned and nodded, eyes sliding to the tops of Julia's breasts, visible and trembling, pale blancmanges in the moonlight. 

"I want to see you, Mrs Morgan," he murmured. "Look!" Ben unzipped his flies and reached in to haul forth his erection. "See how fucking hot you get me?" Ben waggled his cock at Julia. "I want to see your tits, Mrs Morgan. I want to see all of you." 

"Good God," Julia sighed. She stared at the brutal length of Ben's cock and imagined it filling her. 

"Come on," Ben coaxed, "let it go. Show me your boobs." 

And when the young man cranked his fist up and down that gorgeous example of manhood, Julia, with her heart hammering in her chest like the bass drum in a martial band, closed her eyes and let the dress fall to the sand. 

She stood there, immobile, holding her breath and with her eyes closed as she waited for a reaction from Ben. 

The whisper came to her like the sigh of the ocean in the distance. 

"Beautiful, Mrs Morgan. You're fucking lovely." 

Julia opened her eyes and experienced a surge of confidence when she saw Ben's slack-jawed longing. He was stroking his cock and looking at her, totally enraptured. 

"Do you have to call me Mrs Morgan? My name's Julia, Ben." 

Ben's fist paused mid-stroke. He tilted his head and pouted with a quizzical expression. "Do you want me to call you Julia?" 

Emboldened by her newly rejuvenated self-assurance, Julia stepped forward. She reached for Ben's hard-on, the feel of it, so bloody stiff yet paradoxically pliant thrilling her. 

"You know, Ben," she breathed as she squeezed the living gristle, "having you call me Mrs Morgan is pretty sexy. It makes me feel ... naughty." 

Julia closed her eyes and moaned before she then looked down at the thing in her hand. She held Ben's dick like a tennis racquet, her fingers curled around him close to the root with the length of him laid along her forearm. 

Her hand moved slowly, a caress that brought forth a low groan from Ben. 

"When you call me Mrs Morgan it puts me in mind of me being a teacher, as though I'm doing something very wicked." Julia leaned in and ran her tongue over Ben's lips before she pushed it into his mouth. 

They kissed, Ben moaning, his hands coming up to feel Julia's breasts while the woman continued to massage his cock. 

"Can I fuck you, Mrs Morgan?" Ben grunted when the kiss broke. 

Julia lunged and sucked another kiss from Ben's mouth. She sprang back, eyes glittering. "You can do anything you want, Ben. Anything at all." 

When Ben peeled his tee-shirt over his head Julia uttered a tiny cry of delight. God, he was so bloody gorgeous, a clichéd Adonis bathed in the moon's benevolent smile. Melissa and Eammon were forgotten, all that existed for Julia at that second was the supreme example of the male animal in front of her. The life that had preceded that moment, as well as whatever the future had in store, meant nothing, for her. It was all in the now. 

"Take off that bra," Ben instructed as he unbuttoned his cargo pants. He nodded at Julia, eyes between her legs. "And the knickers," he added. "Nude, we've both got to be naked. Skin on skin..." 

"Oh fuck. Oh, Jesus," Julia groaned. Skin on skin? Didn't that sound divine? 

"Mrs Morgan..." Ben grinned, his stare directed at the decorative triangle of Julia's pubic bush. It was on his tongue to compare the daughter to the mother, to make some glib comment about Melissa's complete depilation but, in a moment of wisdom, he thought better of it. 

Seeing the line of Ben's hot-eyed appraisal, her face warming with embarrassment regardless of her ardour, Julia fought the urge to cover herself. 

"Do you like it?" she murmured, unsure. 

"I fucking love it," Ben replied as he moved close to the woman and cupped his palm over her vulva. He gasped when he felt the contrast between the precisely coiffed thatch and the smooth and very slippery folds of Julia's labia. "You're very sexy, Mrs Morgan."  

===

Julia gripped Ben's wrist, desperate for his touch. She held him tight against her body and muttered for him to slide a finger inside. 

"Ben..." the woman gasped when his finger slid over her clitoris. "Fuck ... Oh fucking hell, Ben. Yes." 

They kissed again, their passion surging as Ben tickled Julia's clit and then pushed a single digit into her opening. Julia's fingers worked at Ben's erection, a snail-trail of pre-cum smearing over her wrist. 

Ben hefted one breast and ducked in to take a dark and elongated nipple between his lips, sucking at the woman's flesh before he swapped that teat for its twin. 

Julia's free hand moved over Ben's body, the unfamiliar sensation of youthful muscle beneath her touch thrilling her so that a fresh wave of desire washed over her senses. She wanted him inside her -- now! She didn't care if he was in her mouth or her pussy; she simply craved the man and needed his beautiful cock inside her somewhere ... Anywhere. 

Ben felt the same urgency, but for him it was a near overwhelming desperation for release. He saw himself pounding at Julia, his cock driving into her body as he sought his climax. He had no time for finesse or gentle love-making, Ben was blind to all that. For him it was pure, animal lust, an instinctive and visceral urge. 

"Naked," Ben babbled. "You're nude and I fucking love it." The words grated out of him, a harsh exhalation of desperation through gritted teeth. 

Ben's fingers curled inside Julia and the woman gasped. 

She let go of his cock, both her hands going to his shoulders for support. 

"Do that again," Julia managed to mumble. "Rub me inside like that, again." 

Ben, not feeling the woman's teeth as they sunk into the flesh between his shoulder and neck, braced his wrist and fucked into Julia for several stiff- fingered strokes. He then curled his digits again, the tips rubbing at a rough place inside her, the spongy wetness squelching and farting around him as he probed. 

"If..." Julia gasped, her head lolling forward. "If you keep doing that ... Oh, fuck." Julia's nails dug into Ben's skin on his shoulders. The woman winced and chewed her lower lip, her eyes glazing. "If you keep doing that," she mumbled, "I'll come." 

"Yeah?" Ben responded. "Are you going to come, Mrs Morgan? Are you really going to com on my fingers?" 

A loose nod and a moan confirmed how close the woman was to orgasm. 

"Then get there, Mrs Morgan," Ben urged, his expression wild-eyed, slightly crazed with desire. "Come on..." He licked the woman's cheek, one arm around her torso holding her upright while he massaged that place inside her. "Cum for me, Mrs Morgan. Let me see you do it." Ben began to babble again, almost incoherent with lust as nonsense poured out of him. "Big tis wobbling," he panted. "Naked ... You're fucking gorgeous. Fuck, look at you ... just look at you fucking my fingers." 

The breath exploded from Julia when she came, and Ben, for all his strength, could hardly hold her upright as she grunted and writhed, her nails scoring deep rents in his chest. As softly as he could, while her climax continued to boil, Ben lowered the thrashing woman to the sand. 

He was between her legs, the knob of his cock-head nudging her opening when Julia's eyes focussed on his face. 

"Fuck me," she moaned and lifted her feet from the ground, knees folding. "Do it to me, Ben." 

They did it twice, the first time hot and frenzied, with Ben pulling out at the moment of orgasm, his seed pouring onto Julia's belly in a thick and heavy rain before, after twenty minutes of tender endearments and long kisses, they made love. 

Julia knew, as they walked back to the campsite together, her pussy seeping another man's semen into her underwear, that things between her and Eammon would never be the same. There was a rift now, a rent in their marriage that, as far as she could see, was irreparable. She was surprised at how calm she felt, the realisation dawning that her marriage had probably died some time ago, but she had just refused to accept it. 

What was bad was the guilt at what she'd done to her daughter. The taint of betrayal was already curdling inside her, and for that she was sorry, so very sorry. 

"I'm going to leave," Julia said as the couple paused at the crest of the dune. She threw a look at the caravan, wondering if Eammon and Melissa were waiting inside. "I'm going home, back to the house. I won't be able to hide what we've done, Ben. They'll know that we ... that we..." 

It hit Ben like a shock of cold water being thrown over him: he'd fucked Melissa's mother and his first inclination was to run and hide, to get away and avoid any tears and tantrums. 

In later years, married and with a family of his own, Ben would look back and feel the shame of his actions, but at the time he'd looked down at Julia Morgan and nodded, too concerned for himself to worry about the impact of his actions on Melissa or her father. "I think I'd better get out of here too," he said. 

And then they set off down the track that led into the site, both of them hoping for an easy getaway. 

5 

When Julia stormed out of the pub, with Ben following, father and daughter had remained at the table, both of them tense, stiff and unspeaking, a wall of unspoken emotion between them. 

The young waitress arrived and, sensing almost palpable disharmony, placed two pints of lager, a gin and tonic and a white wine down without bothering to ask which drink was Melissa's. 

"What happened over there?" the waitress whispered to the woman behind the bar, flicking her head towards a stony-faced Eammon and the pouty Melissa. 

The barmaid shrugged. 

"The woman ran off. Looked upset about something. Young bloke, the good-looking one with the fit bod went after her." She winked and smirked. "Mebbe there's a tangled web of illicit sex and deceit," she added. 

The girl chuckled and rolled her eyes. 

"You read too many dirty books." She chanced a look over her shoulder. "Shall I leave off with asking if they want to order food? They don't look too happy." 

The barmaid nodded. 

"Yep. I don't think either of them two has much of an appetite." She gave her indifferent shrug again. "They'll yell if they do want to eat. I'd leave 'em if I were you." Then, already putting the minor altercation out of her mind, she smiled at a couple who walked into the pub and strolled up to the bar. "Evening, folks. Are you dining or is it just a drink ... Janine here will show you a table and take your order..." 

Unaware of their fleeting celebrity status among the staff, Eammon and Melissa stayed rooted to their seats. 

Eammon picked up one of the pints and drained half in three quick swallows. 

"Bloody great holiday," he muttered, wiping the back of his hand across wet lips. 

Melissa lifted the gin and drained the glass. "It's your fault," she replied, her voice clipped. "You don't care about Mum, you can't let me just get on with my life." 

Stung by his daughter's accusations, Eammon blinked. He looked at Melissa, the injustice of her comments a bubble of pain in his chest. His mouth opened as a sharp rebuke rose out of him -- How dare she speak to him like that? 

And then, when he stared into the girl's face, her features spoiled by her own anger and frustrations, Eammon saw her as she'd been when he'd watched her with Ben. 

A hot wave of shame wafted over him: he'd spied on his daughter, hidden in the shrubbery all sneaky and clandestine and watched as she'd shared an intimate, a very intimate, private moment. 

What kind of man behaved that way? Regardless of his feelings he should accept the fact that Melissa was a woman now. She was an adult and had every right to have a boyfriend and to ... to want to sleep with him, no matter how difficult or unpalatable as that might be for a father to accept. 

"Oh, Mel," Eammon sighed, his head lolling with defeat, chin on chest. "I'm sorry," he mumbled. 

Seeing her father so contrite leached the ire from the girl. Her shoulders slumped as the tension drained out of her, the fight and animosity evaporating. 

"You're such an idiot," Melissa said, the tenderness in her tone showing she didn't mean it as an insult, more an expression of exasperation. 

Eammon nodded. 

"I can be," he said, lifting the glass. He swallowed the remaining half pint and continued with, "I know I can be overbearing and authoritative. But that's the job, Mel. I've got to be tough for work." 

Melissa rolled her eyes and batted her father's reasoning aside. 

"You're not a police inspector at home, Dad. I know they say a policeman is never off duty, but you could just relax when you're not at work?" She leaned across the table and touched her father's hand. 

The physical contact, no matter how innocent the gesture was meant, sent a thrill of arousal through Eammon. A vision of Melissa all nude and lovely, smiling that lop-sided grin as she'd flaunted herself at the soldier, knowing she was desirable, flitted across Eammon's inner screen. His cock stiffened. 

"I love you, Mel," Eammon said, the words coming out thick and gargled. 

Melissa blinked at the weird look that had suddenly crossed her father's face. She shrank back away from him, puzzled at his tone. 

She picked up the wine glass and took a sip, eyes heavy with suspicion as she regarded her father. 

"Uh ... I love you, too, Dad," the girl replied, uncertain. 

Had she really heard that tone in her father's voice? It had sounded like he fancied her. Surely not? It was a mistake. Her dad was just choked up with reaction to all the upset, just like she was. He'd not meant it like it sounded. He loved her, yes, but not like that. 

"I love you too, but you've got to stop trying to run my life." Melissa glugged more wine and felt the pleasant buzz of the gin she'd already downed. Her confidence surged. "I'm all grown up. I'm a woman. Dad, you've got to let me get on with it," she said, her tone soft. 

Eammon sighed as though he carried an almost intolerable burden. 

"I'll try, Mel," he said. "Really, I'll try." 

"Do you think we should try and find them?" Melissa asked. 

Her father pointed at the beer and wine. 

"In a few minutes. Let's not waste these, eh?" 

Fifteen minutes later, after checking the caravan and finding it empty, Eammon and Melissa searched further afield. Neither of them considered the beach, reasoning that Ben and Julia would be in one of the other pubs dotted along the road. Julia had been angry and upset, Ben would have caught up with her in no time and probably have steered he to another pub. 

Eammon and Melissa tried three more pubs, taking a drink in each before deciding, both feeling the effects of alcohol, to check the caravan again. 

"That's funny," Eammon said, slipping on the S. "Ben's tent's gone." 

It took three attempts to get the key into the lock, with Eammon squinting one- eyed, concentrating hard. Too much booze too quick on an empty stomach. 

The note was propped up on the kitchen counter. 

"How could she do it?" Melissa sobbed, stunned by her own mother's duplicity. "And him ...? How could he do it to me? With my mother!" 

Eammon couldn't help himself. Melissa's body was pressed against his front, his arms were around her. His instinct was to hold her and comfort her, soothe her like a father should. But his head fizzed with ale and his responses were all messed up. The combination of beer, carnal yearning for his own daughter and the girl's distress somehow grew muddled. His thinking blurred, the line of morality distorted, and in a moment of weakness, unable to resist, Eammon allowed his hands to slide under the hem of Melissa's tee-shirt. 

The skin of her back felt incredible, smooth under his palms as his hands slid higher, fingers reaching the strap of Melissa's bra. He pulled the girl closer, his nose in her hair, breathing in the scent of her, the embrace tightening as his cock swelled. 

Lust boiled inside Eammon, it was all too much. She was so pretty, so bloody gorgeous. Melissa smelt so good and she was so warm pressed to him. 

Eammon groaned, a long, low moan of visceral longing as, without truly knowing what he was doing he unclasped his daughter's bra and, stepping back, hauled its cups and the front of the girl's tee-shirt upwards. 

"Melissa," Eammon sighed, his eyes fastened on his daughter's breasts. "You're so lovely..." 

Part Two 

1 

Melissa, her responses slowed by alcohol, eventually realised she was standing there with the front of her tee-shirt yanked up, her breasts somehow bared. Then, stunned by alcohol and surprise, the shock at what her mother and Ben had done still rocking her, it came to Melissa: her father had done this. He was the one who'd undone her bra and pulled her tee-shirt up. 

A dim recollection of his expression and the husky timbre of is voice, so laden with sexual desire, came back to her, penetrating her fogged mind. The way he'd looked at her in the pub...? 

At the time she'd shrugged it off, dismissed it, but now she couldn't deny it, he was there in front of her, eyes all glazed, his face almost idiotic. Her father was almost salivating with whatever deep, base desire he had curdling inside him. 

The girl pulled back, wrenched herself free of the man's grip, her tee-shirt tearing. 

"What the fuck...?" Melissa spat, sobering quickly in the adrenalin rush. "Dad ... Jesus, Dad, what are you doing? Have you gone in-fucking-sane?" The girl pawed at her bra, struggling to cover herself. 

"I saw you," Eammon blurted. "Out there, with him." His arm flapped in the vague direction of the dune. "I saw you with him." The man sucked in a breath, blinking at Melissa as the girl took a step backwards. "You were so lovely, Mel," he whined. "So bloody gorgeous. I couldn't help it, darling. I watched you, with him and I wanted it to be me. You're such a pretty girl, Mel, so precious. I..." 

Eammon swallowed quickly several times, his throat working as he struggled to get the words out. He had to make Melissa understand. He loved her; he wanted her. 

"...I love you, Mel," he finished with a gasp, rendered incapable of further speech by the whirl of desires inside him. 

"Dad... No, don't, don't say that. Don't look at me that way." Melissa's mouth moved, her jaw opening and closing, her eyes wide with incredulity as, stunned, she struggled to make sense of all that had happened -- was still happening. 

Her father took a pace towards her, his hand reaching out. He wore a maniacal grin, a rictus of stretched skin around clenched teeth that reminded Melissa on some distant yet oddly lucid level of a Hollywood zombie hungry for brains. 

"Fuck off, Dad!" she yelped. "Leave me alone. Are you fucking mental?" 

A few moments later, after being brought to his senses by Melissa's frightened, outraged cry and the slap she'd cracked against his cheek, his head still fuzzy with booze through the ringing in his ears, Eammon found himself outside the cubicle that was Melissa's bedroom in the caravan. 

"Mel," he mumbled, his forehead resting against the door panel. "Please, baby, let me in. I'm sorry. I ... I need to talk to you ... Mel?" 

It would be a simple thing, forcing the lock, but Eammon knew that he'd frightened his daughter enough without resorting to breaking the flimsy latch and barging in on her. He might be pissed but he had enough sense left to realise that. 

Eammon felt the beginnings of a headache and stumbled along the short corridor to the kitchen. He poured a glass of water and drank. 

What the hell had he been thinking? What a stupid, insane thing to say. How could he have just stood there and babbled all that crap? 

Eammon groaned, his toes actually curling inside his shoes with mortification at the recollection of unclasping his daughter's bra and hauling up her tee- shirt. 

What must she be going through now? What must she think of him? 

Eammon went back to Melissa's door. 

Her voice came from the far side of the door panel at her father's knock. 

"Go away, Dad. Please, just fuck off." 

Eammon heard her distress and acceded to Melissa's request with a heavy reluctance pulling in his guts. 

What choice did he have? 

The man went to the kitchenette and filled the kettle with water. There would be no sleep for him that night, nor Mellissa either he assumed. Eammon made the coffee and, after discovering a packet of his wife's cigarettes in the drawer when he scrabbled about for a teaspoon, staggered outside, the caravan door clattering against the side panel as he stumbled out into the night air. 

Melissa found him there the next morning, slumped forward with his elbows on his knees, forehead in the palms of his hands, cold coffee in a cup on the grass at his feet amid the cigarette butts. 

2 

When her father's face swivelled towards her, Melissa saw his tortured expression -- the anguish etched into parenthesis at the corners of his mouth. She realised with a jolt just how troubled her father was; Melissa thought she understood her father's pain: after all, her mother had just walked out following her infidelity and he'd made a clumsy pass at his own daughter. It was obvious he hadn't slept. Her father looked dog rough, emotionally battered and bruised. 

Despite her shock and subsequent anger over Eammon's behaviour, regardless of her own heartache at Ben's betrayal and abrupt, cowardly departure, Melissa experienced a sudden breathlessness and what felt like a huge balloon swelling in her chest. 

She felt so sorry for her father and, for all his faults -- the way he tried to rule her life, his apparent lack of care for her mother -- Melissa was caught in the strong current of feelings for him. He'd been great as she grew up, a really good dad, and things might have gotten a little bent out of shape in the last year or so but there were enough good times in her memories that Melissa could find it in her heart to forgive him the aberration of the night before. The drunk with lust-crazed eyes wasn't her Dad, that bloke was boozed up and reeling from his wife's infidelity. It wouldn't happen again, Melissa was certain. 

They could put this right, Melissa knew they could. Besides, with her mother having done a runner Melissa needed her father. 

"Dad," the girl murmured. "Why don't you come inside? We've got things to talk about." 

"Y-you're still talking to me?" Eammon croaked. His throat felt raw, unused to cigarettes and Eammon grimaced at the taste in his mouth. "After what I? ... Mel," he hesitated, unable to bring himself to speak of the way he'd ripped his daughter's tee-shirt and exposed her breasts. 

Eammon asked himself the question, again, the one that had been running around in his head all night: What the hell had he been thinking? 

He sucked a deep breath in through is nostrils, vaguely registering the early start to what promised, weather-wise at least, to be a glorious day. 

"I'm sorry about what I did, Mel. I was in a crazy place. You know, with your mum and everything." 

The feelings of sympathy and love for her father swelled in Melissa's chest again, rocks of anger and a need to punish her mother and Ben lurking below the surface. 

"I ... I think I understand, Dad," the girl stuttered. "What Mum did..." She shook her head and sighed. "Why don't you come inside and I'll make some tea and toast. We can try to talk about it. We can try to make some sense out of it all, Dad." 

Tears prickled Eammon's eyes. He blinked up at the lovely young woman standing framed in the doorway to the caravan. 

"Do you forgive me, Mel?" he rasped, not quite believing the strength and maturity of his daughter. 

The girl nodded. 

"I think so." 

She turned quickly and called from inside the caravan. 

"Tea and toast, Dad! Then we can talk." 

Following brisk activity at the kitchen counter, father and daughter sat at the round table set in one corner of the room, Eammon seated on the curved, moulded plastic bench, with Melissa on one of the spindle-legged chairs, the bulk of the caravan behind her.  

===

"Why did you try to kiss me last night, Dad?" Melissa asked after several bites of toast and a slurp of near scalding tea. 

The direct question came at him like a blow, and Eammon winced at the brutal honesty. He knew then what it felt like for the criminals -- alleged criminals that is -- he'd interviewed over the years. His mind spun as he tried to come up with any plausible answer other than the truth. He couldn't tell Melissa the bald actuality of the matter -- How could he? How could he tell the girl, his own flesh and blood, that he'd lusted after her body, had masturbated while thinking about her, and had even pictured Melissa's nudity while he'd fucked her mother? 

"Come on, Dad," Melissa whispered, adding, "don't try to con me. Didn't you say last night that you'd seen me with Ben? What was it you said? Something about watching me with him and wishing it was you? You didn't really mean that, did you, Dad?" 

Eammon sucked air in through his nose so hard that the flesh around his nostrils squeezed shut. He boggled at his daughter as she regarded him from beneath sculpted eyebrows, the pale blue irises steady and enquiring. 

How could he have forgotten that detail, the blurted, drunken admission? He was the DI, a Detective Inspector of police -- how could a man of his experience be so wrong-footed by an eighteen-year-old girl? 

Eventually, Eammon sighed and, slumped with defeat, head bowed he mumbled at the table-top: "I love you, Mel." The man shrugged, resigned to his fate. He didn't care anymore. "I can't explain why I felt what I did. I saw you and I wanted you ... Like a man wants a woman." 

His head snapped up, eyes imploring, he needed the girl to understand. He wasn't a bad man, he was just confused. 

Eammon swallowed, throat suddenly dry with fear at Melissa's reaction if he continued. 

But he had to carry on. Eammon needed to unload. He had to get it all out in the open. 

"I was jealous of Ben," Eammon said, faltering at first. Then, his voice rising, he continued. "I'm not ready to let you go, Mel," he blurted, the words bubbling out of him. "You're my daughter. It's my job to protect you. I love you and wanted to keep you close, to watch over you. I followed you along the track. It was so busy on the beach I knew you'd never notice me. Then I saw you walk off down that trail and I lagged behind a bit. I lost you for a little while but then heard something -- I think it was you, giggling. 

"I knew what I was going to see before I got there. There was this weird feeling; I knew I was doing wrong but I couldn't stop myself. It was a strange sort of ... thrill, I suppose. There was something going on just out of my sight, something that drew me to it. It excited me ... you know, aroused me. 

"But when I saw it ... saw you ... Oh God, Mel, you were so lovely. Seeing you naked... 

"Even though you're my daughter and I knew I shouldn't have been looking, I stayed. I stayed and watched you with him. 

"I wanted to be him. Me, your dad, I wanted to do those things with you." 

Melissa stared at her father for a long time, unblinking, not speaking. Immobile. 

She'd asked and he'd told her, let it all pour out. She'd chipped away at the dam of her father's reticence and been swept up in the flood after breaking through. 

Her reaction surprised her. Okay, she was shocked, sure, gobsmacked by the admission. She considered being outraged for a few moments, but discarded the idea since the simple truth of it was that she didn't feel outraged. 

Melissa finally blinked when her brain registered, after a frantic analysis, after considering just what it was her father had said, the overriding sentiment she felt. As potentially devastating such information could be, Melissa felt enormous respect for her father. It must have been so difficult to admit it to her? It must have been hard enough to admit it to himself, but he'd also found the guts to confront it and bring it out into the open. He'd done it; he'd been honest and told the truth. 

And, inside it all, lying there at the centre was the pearl of her father's love. 

He loved her and somehow that sentiment had altered, developed into sexual feelings. It might be shocking but Melissa could just about get her head around it. 

She looked into her father's face and saw again the anguish. He was waiting, she realised, waiting for a response from her, and Melissa could see the concern behind his eyes. Her father was just sitting there, certain that she was about to unload all over him. 

His face was almost comical when Melissa reached across the table for her father's hand. His jaw fell and he gawped at her when the girl murmured, "It's okay, Dad. I love you too. Don't let it eat at you. I get it; I understand that you got a little out of control. I don't hate you, Dad; I do get it, sort of. You don't have to feel bad." 

3 

They decided, after much conversation and a gallon of tea, to remain at the campsite. 

"We both need to get our heads straight, Dad. We've had some big shocks in the last ... what is it? twelve hours or so...?" 

Eammon, exhausted by the turmoil, nodded. The girl was right, they could do with some time to breathe, to adjust, and He could deal with Julia some other time. 

It had been Melissa who broached the subject of her mother, asking her father if he would take her back. 

Eammon had pondered and then announced that he had enough going on in his head without thinking about that subject, that to confront his wife over her actions would be too much to face. He also reasoned that Julia herself might benefit from some time apart. 

"Besides," Eammon had said, a tentative grin shaping his lips, "I've paid for a week in this caravan ... The weather's great ... It'd be a crime to waste it." 

Caught on the hop by her father's dead-pan delivery, caught with a mouthful of tea, Melissa guffawed and shot forward in her seat. "Tea-spew! she coughed, eyes watering as liquid spilled out of her nose. 

Eammon laughed, a huge sound straight from the belly as, helpless with mirth he watched his daughter cough and splutter, her whole body caught in paroxysm, unable to control her own laughter. 

The laughter grew, a boil lanced by the comedy of the moment as father and daughter snorted and cuffed at eyes filled with tears of mirth. It took several minutes for them to calm, the giggles returning whenever they caught each other's eye. 

Finally, with giggles bubbling inside her, Melissa staggered across the room towards the kitchen counter. 

"You git," the girl grinned, suddenly euphoric at the way things had turned out. She dabbed her eyes with the heel of one hand before tearing a sheet from the kitchen roll. "I almost choked!" 

Eammon chuckled, grateful for the laughter and Melissa's good grace. He tilted his head and looked at the girl, expression abruptly serious. 

"Are you upset about Ben?" he asked. 

"Oh yeah," Melissa answered, sobering when she noticed her father's straight face. "But I think I'll get over him." Throwing the damp, tea-stained sheet of kitchen roll into the pedal bin, Melissa held out her arms. "Come and give me a hug, Dad." 

Eammon found himself, after a moment's hesitation, moving towards his daughter. He was staggered that she'd forgiven him, amazed at her trust and willingness to let him hold her, especially after what he'd done the previous night. 

"I'm fine," the girl mumbled into her father's chest as they embraced. "In fact I'm better than fine. In spite of what's gone on I feel like we've got a fresh start, Dad." The girl leaned back, the strong arms holding her as she looked up into the familiar face. "You don't have to stand watch over me, Dad. If you let me go I'm more inclined to come back, eh? Give me some freedom." 

Eammon got it, understood exactly what his daughter meant. He harrumphed, clearing his throat of the huge ball that had settled there. He nodded and said, his voice gruff as he felt the tears well, "A fresh start, baby. I love you. And thanks." 

They stayed that way for several more seconds, Melissa snuggling her face back against her father's chest. 

Eventually she wriggled free and walked towards her bedroom. 

"I'm going to shower and then I'm off to sunbathe," Melissa called back. "You're right about the weather." A wry grin twisted Eammon's lips and he shook his head when his daughter added, "It'd be a crime to waste it! And I'll let you do the washing up." 

Melissa showered and slipped on her bikini briefs before tying the cord of the top at the nape of her neck. She smeared on sun block and considered asking her dad to rub the stuff into her back, but put it off as a bad job. Not yet, she wouldn't put him in that position for a while, it would be best to let all the drama blow over first. 

Following some contortionist moves, her body covered by a tee-shirt and, earing the Daisy Dukes, hair in a pony-tail, sunglasses in place, she was ready. 

With the morning's pots washed and stacked on the draining board Eammon watched his daughter walk over the dune from his bedroom window. 

He saw the feminine hip-sway, her backside packed inside the denim and the length of her legs from the ragged hem down to her flip-flops. "Oh shit," he mumbled, appalled at the thoughts the girl's slim figure elicited. 

He'd thought it was over, had imagined the carnal desires for his daughter had subsided. 

It appeared he'd been wrong. 

He showered in an effort to cleanse his mind as he washed his body. His hand strayed to his cock, which stiffened immediately, already twitching to half- mast when the images of a nude Melissa, her face contorted with agonised pleasure as she knelt and took the soldier's long cock from behind, came to Eammon's mind. 

He stroked his length while imagining his daughter's breasts -- He could have just leaned in and sucked one of her nipples the night before... 

"No," he grunted, releasing his hard-on, struggling for self-control. "Stop it, you perv. Stop it, now." 

Eammon towelled dry, his erection refusing to abate, the thick jib of it waggling and waving in constant reminder. 

Exhausted from a night of no sleep, having slid in and out of a hazy level of consciousness as he'd sat in the chair outside the caravan during the dark hours, Eammon lay on his bed. But sleep refused to come, and the only subject his tortured mind could focus on was Melissa. He thrashed around on the bed, the day growing warmer while thoughts of the girl sunbathing in the clearing tormented him. 

Earlier that morning he had experienced first-hand how it felt for the interviewee during a session of questioning, and now Eammon had some clue what an addict went through when the cravings started. 

He rose from the ruined bed, the sheets a mess, evidence of the man's frustrated attempt at sleep. Eammon stood at the window for ten full minutes, his face blank, body still as the war waged inside him. Eventually, inevitably, with the after-image of Melissa in his head as he'd seen her walking over the dune, knowing exactly where she intended to sunbathe, recalling her nudity and what she'd done with Ben, he left the caravan and locked the door. 

4 

Melissa ignored the beach, preferring instead the solitude of the lovers' clearing. A pang of loss griped in her stomach when she arrived, the place held a special meaning for her. Not any more, though, Melissa resolved. Now it was just a spot she knew where she could sunbathe in relative privacy, a place where she could let the sun caress her skin while she dozed away the time. 

The girl unfurled the rolled-up beach towel with a deft flick and, after checking the sun's track and the direction of her shadow, undressed down to her bikini. She lay there for a few minutes, eyelids suddenly heavy and she began to doze. It had been a fitful night of little sleep, and what time she had spent asleep had been filled with bizarre, disturbing dreams, dreams that startled her awake and left her blinking in the dark. Then there had been the scene with her father, a draining time that, although had cleared the air between father and daughter, had sucked what little energy she had remaining. 

Melissa slept until the alarm she'd set on her phone sounded and snapped her back to consciousness. After a brief adjustment to the position of the towel, aligning it with her shadow, she settled down again, this time on her front. 

She dozed again until the alarm trilled. Time to turn. Melissa lined up with the sun once more but, just as she was about to settle onto the towel a thought came to her. She examined her surroundings, a thrill of daring making her shiver. 

"Fuck it," the girl muttered to herself. "Why not?" 

Reaching for the knot at the nape of her neck, Melissa tugged the string and exposed her breasts to the sun's warming gaze. She lifted her rump and slipped the bikini bottoms over her hips and along her legs. 

Out of the bag came the sunscreen, which she then drizzled onto her boobs, nipples rising with expectation when she massaged the gloop into her skin. She rubbed a palm smeared with the stuff over the vulnerable place her pubic bush would cover if she hadn't waxed it smooth, a sudden burst of sexual arousal coursing through her when she touched herself. 

Melissa, sitting upright with her thighs apart, allowed her finger to slide lower. She gasped when the tip slid over her clitoris and the heat burst between her legs. 

"Fuck," she mumbled, eyelids drooping, mouth falling open. "That's bloody gorgeous." 

The girl splayed her labia with the fingers of one hand, her index finger on the prepuce that hid her shy clit. Rubbing herself gently Melissa watched her finger move against her own flesh. "Yes," she breathed as tiny pulses radiated outwards from her core. "So fucking good..." 

Thoughts of Ben came to mind; she imagined him there with her, his tongue splitting her labia, lapping at her and sucking her clitty. Melissa collapsed backwards, lying on her back while her fingers worked quickly between her thighs. In her mind's eye she pictured a lover, now just some anonymous, faceless form since Ben had been consigned to the past. Melissa had no use for him -- emotionally, physically or in her fantasy. The phantom in her mind was enough, his tongue moving from her sex to trace a path upwards, flicking over her tummy and between her breasts. He paused to tease one teat, the nipple elongated and tender, with his lips and tongue before the other breast received the same attention. 

The man licked Melissa's throat and then kissed her mouth. 

She tasted herself on his tongue and fingered her sex, her opening flooded, labia slippery with the desire that sluiced out of her. 

Melissa, groaning and gasping, rolled onto her front. Her fingers scissored between her thighs, hips jerking as she rolled from side-to-side, buttocks thrust upwards. She grunted and finger-fucked herself with two stiff fingers before sliding the digits, slick with lust, from her opening and rubbed her clitoris. 

The girl moaned with a long, low gurgle that bubbled out of her -- she was close, so fucking close to coming... 

She had both hands at work by then, with one arm flung back so her forearm was draped over the cheek of her backside as she fucked herself with three fingers. The other arm was trapped beneath her body, fingers urgently sawing her tormented clitoris. 

Her climax was close, so close. Melissa could feel the orgasm simmering, visualised the pleasure like a pan full of milk on a hot stove. If she continued at that frantic pace she would just boil over, the pleasure rising rapidly to overwhelm her, exactly the same way milk, when it reached that critical temperature, heaved inside the pan and surged over the lip. 

"No," she grunted. "Not yet..." 

The girl gasped and, not a second too soon, snatched her hand away from her sex. Her fingers sucked out of her pussy and Melissa gasped, rolling onto her back, a forearm flung over her forehead. 

"Shit," she gasped while her chest heaved with effort. "Fuck ... That was so good..." 

Again she heaved herself upright, examining herself between her legs. She saw the folds of her labia dangling all loose and floppy and tacky with desire. Melissa felt hot and swollen down there, could feel her insides clenching, her pussy hungry and unfulfilled. The girl could almost hear it snarling. She flicked at the loose flesh of those lips between her legs, wincing at the exquisite agony when her finger flicked over the bean of her clit. 

Lust bubbled inside her again, and Melissa took a tentative rub at the delicate and tender nub of her clit. 

She winced and gasped, preparing to turn up the heat again. This time however she'd just let it go, allow herself to climax, there was no way she could hold it back. 

It was just as she began again that the eerie sensation came upon her. She felt the hairs on her neck rise as a prickle, like an insect crawling over her skin, rippled along the track of her spine. 

Melissa sucked in a breath, eyes widening as she froze, the hand between her thighs stilling in an instant. 

She knew with intuitive certainty that someone was there, watching. Melissa could almost feel the stare burning into her skin. Her first thought was Ben, he'd come back to beg for forgiveness and was skulking around on the periphery of the clandestine spot spying on her. 

Maybe he didn't have the balls to approach her? Perhaps he lacked the courage to confront her face-to-face? 

But what if it wasn't Ben? What if it was some stranger out there? It could be anyone. It could be a nice bloke, someone who had just bumbled into the scene. After all, Melissa reasoned quickly --part of her brain working at speed even though her body remained frozen -- a man stumbling across a pretty girl, a naked woman masturbating in the sun, would surely stop and watch. 

But what if whoever was out there wasn't nice? What if some disgusting creature came crashing out of the undergrowth intent on defiling her tender, youthful body? 

Melissa rose to a half crouch, poised like a sprinter in the blocks, ready to grab her clothes and run. 

Fight or flight... 

Another thought snuck into her head. An oily whisper, dark and clandestine - - What if it was her father out there? 

The girl slumped onto her knees, heart thumping. 

She couldn't explain it, not even to herself, later on when she analysed the actions that followed. 

For some reason -- maybe her pussy clamouring for attention; perhaps her overheated libido or even the possibility she was just a randy bitch -- Melissa closed her eyes and massaged a breast with one hand. 

The thought of it, her own father spying on her got her hot. She recognised it as madness but just didn't care. Melissa knew he'd seen her with Ben and that it had turned her dad on, and now she felt the same illicit thrill. 

With one hand mauling her tits, Melissa began to rub at her sex again. She melted onto the towel, her legs folding as she fingered herself towards a climax. 

It all came to her in a swirl of impressions: the sun warming her; her nudity; the tingle starting in her toes and which she could feel in the roof of her mouth of all places. 

Her father was out there, watching. Was he tugging his cock? 

"Oh, fuck..." the girl moaned when that image came to mind. "Wank it, Daddy," she whispered to herself. "Pull that cock for your darling daughter. Look at me. See me fingering my cunt while you watch?" 

Melissa came as she pictured her father's semen spurting out of him. She writhed and gasped and cried out in ecstasy, her body squelching and farting around fingers buried up to the knuckle while those lewd, obscene images rolled across the screen of her mind.

Eammon arrived just in time to see his daughter peel the bikini briefs over her shins. Completely transfixed by the girl's sublime loveliness, there was no way he could turn away from the sight of her, not any more. The moment for turning back and pushing carnal thoughts for Melissa had left the building.  

===

He knelt there, covered by the scrub, hidden behind a straggly clump of greenery and gave up his morality. Eammon traded his honour for a few minutes of grubbing around on his knees spying on his own flesh and blood. 

He watched, eyes bulging, his cock doing the same when the girl oiled her breasts and pudenda. 

"Dear God..." he muttered when Melissa started to rub between her legs. 

He was stroking the length of his meat, his stare stuck to the girl, unbreakable when she rolled onto her front, hips working, grinding against her fingers. Eammon was sure his daughter was about to come. She was panting and groaning -- and what a sound her groans were, so thrilling in their bestial urgency -- as she fucked herself with her fingers. 

Eammon felt the rush of his orgasm, biting back on the cry of pure ecstasy that threatened to burst of him. 

Then his daughter stopped and rolled onto her back, an arm over her brow. Eammon slowed his pumping fist. He watched her as she gasped for breath, soaking in every detail of the girl's body. He moaned when Melissa sat upright, his position in the scrub, the angle in which he was situated to his daughter giving him a near perfect view between her thighs as she studied her vulva. When she flicked her clitoris and moaned, Eammon stroked his cock, the lust surging through him again, brighter and hotter than before. 

Just as Eammon felt the gush of his ejaculate was imminent, he gulped in disbelief, a heavy stone of dread thunking into his guts. Melissa was kneeling, her expression anxious. The girl squatted there apparently poised on the brink of flight. 

Panic squeezed the man's vitals, a hand of dread that paradoxically gripped his guts and loosened his sphincter at the same time. 

If she came at him and saw him crouching, a fist around his cock, it would all be over. The noble sentiments of their earlier conversation, the bond they'd established all gone. 

Eammon swallowed heavily, damping down on the whine he could feel rising in his chest. 

Then, for some inexplicable reason Eammon couldn't fathom, Melissa rested back on her haunches, squatting with the lips of her pussy dangling in plain view. The girl lifted a hand to her breast and Eammon gawped, breathless and unbelieving as his daughter fingered those meaty flaps and, in a fluid motion, her legs liquefying, ended up on her back. 

Eammon cranked a fist along his cock. He'd never felt it so stiff, so fucking huge, and he watched his lovely girl as she writhed and moaned, his eyes never leaving her while he gnawed his bottom lip and spurted gout after gout of jizm into the sandy ground. His dick was still spitting, threads of the stuff clinging to a branch of some unknown bush as, with a primordial instinct of self-preservation driving him, he scrabbled away from the scene of the crime, Melissa's grunts and mewling masking the sound of hasty departure. 

The guilt filled him immediately. It seemed that, as the semen pumped out of him, a disproportionate volume of remorse flooded in and a heavy curtain of foreboding settled over Eammon as he scuttled back to the caravan. 

The events came back to him, a sequence of impressions that left him certain that Melissa had known he was there. Hadn't she frozen like a deer sensing unseen danger? He'd seen the look on her face and watched her rise onto the balls of her feet, one fist on the towel ready to push off and run. 

But, if she had intuited someone spying, why had she carried on masturbating? What was that all about? 

The man grew perplexed, confused by all that had happened. He unlocked the door to the van and banged the door back on its hinges, his mind filled to bursting with scenarios. He considered taking the car and going, just fleeing from everything and putting distance between himself and Melissa. 

In his bedroom, Eammon stripped out of shorts smeared with jizm. He forced himself to breathe slowly, struggling to decide what course of action to take. 

In the end he decided to front it out. He'd be cool and at as if nothing was untoward. He would volunteer nothing, only respond if questioned. And, if Melissa did start asking about how he'd spent part of the afternoon, he'd tell her a bald-faced lie; he'd say he'd been sleeping. 

He was a copper, for fuck's sake. He could lie easily enough. 

Eammon waited for his daughter to return, anticipation fluttering inside him.

Father and daughter sat at the little round table in the dining area of the caravan. Melissa watched her father as he ate, studying him, looking for clues, any indication he'd lied. 

"This is good," Eammon complimented through a mouthful of pizza. 

"I just opened the packet and stuck it in the oven," replied Melissa. "It didn't take much doing. 

Eammon nodded, jaw working. He swallowed. 

"Did you have a good sleep?" 

Melissa gave a nod of her own. 

"Yes, I didn't get much sleep last night. I had a doze when I was sunbathing, but I was knackered all the same." 

She kept an eye out for any reaction from her father at the mention of sunbathing 

No response other than a moue of empathy pursing his lips. If he was the one who'd spied he was hiding it well. 

"I know what you mean, Mel. I needed to sleep myself." 

Eammon lifted a slice and bit into it. 

Melissa began to doubt that the mystery stalker had been her father. In fact she had begun to think she'd imagined it, that there had been nobody there at all. She thought back to what she'd done, the lewd performance for what she now thought was most likely to be a figment of her imagination. 

But what about the scuffed ground? How could she deny the evidence she'd discovered when, after quickly hauling on the bikini bottoms and covering her breasts with her tee-shirt pressed to her chest, Melissa had scoured the area around her and found the ground disturbed? What about the spots of that unidentifiable something -- which could so easily be spunk -- on the sandy soil? 

Her mind began to work on the denial: an animal could have been responsible for both phenomena. Anything, a rabbit even, could have made those marks. The damp stains she wasn't so sure about, but there was probably some innocent explanation for those also -- Spray from a small mammal marking its territory? An animal that she had scared off with her grunting and groaning? 

Then the girl's mind turned to what she'd done. Her face warmed. Melissa was both appalled and embarrassed by the fact she had actually masturbated while under the impression her father was watching. 

But the thought of it, to her horror when she'd calmed down and analysed her actions, still shifted something dark and primordial inside her. That climax had been the most intense she could remember ever experiencing. She'd fingered her pussy hard and rubbed her clit raw, exhibited herself in the most obscene way, or so she'd thought, for her father. 

What had she said? Something like "Wank it, Daddy"? 

Her father's voice brought Melissa back from her mental turmoil. 

"Are you all right, Mel?" 

Her head snapped up and she saw the puzzled expression on the man's face. 

"Uh ... Yes. Sorry, Dad. I'm fine. I was away with the fairies..." 

"You look a little flushed there, baby." 

Melissa rose and pushed the chair with the back of her legs. She needed to get out from under her father's gaze. He was a policeman, he'd know if she told him any lies. And she would have to lie, there was no way she could tell the truth if he asked her any probing questions. Melissa couldn't hear herself saying: "I'm okay, Dad, just a little embarrassed because I had three fingers wedged in my cunt when I thought you were watching me wanking". 

"I'm just a bit warm, that's all," she muttered, her eyes sliding from the man's face. "I think I'll just have a shower." Melissa couldn't look her father in the eyes, certain he'd be able to read her soul if she did. "I'll have a shower and cool down." She paused at the door and risked a glance over her shoulder. "We could go to the pub, couldn't we?" 

Eammon considered the suggestion. "Yeah. Why not?" 

Melissa dropped the tee-shirt into the laundry hamper. The pub had been a good idea. A distraction. Better than sitting in with her dad; he'd be less likely to notice any agitation on her part that way. 

The girl paused with the denim cut-offs in her hand. She looked down into the canvas hamper and saw a pair of her father's shorts nestled there among the clothes he'd worn the previous night. Melissa was certain that the shorts hadn't been there earlier in the day because, having had the vague domesticated notion of putting a load of washing in the machine, she'd checked before heading out to sunbathe. Then, in her hurry to get out in the sun she'd forgotten the chore. But the shorts hadn't been there. She was certain. 

Her Daisy Dukes fell to the floor before she reached into the hamper. 

Melissa pulled out the shorts. They were stiff with ... something. Stained and crusty with whatever Eammon had spilled on them. 

But, Melissa surmised when she recognised the silvery snail-trail for what it was, her father hadn't spilled anything, what it looked like to her, and she was no detective, not like her dad, but the evidence suggested he'd been pulling his cock and come all over his clothes.

"You were there, weren't you?" 

Eammon looked up, a slice of pizza in his hand. His eyes went from Melissa's face to the evidence balled in her fist as she thrust the shorts at him like an accusation. 

"It was you. You were there..." 

"Mel ... Oh God, Mel." He was on his feet. Eammon banged his hip on the table as he moved around it. "It isn't what you think," he babbled. "I ... I..." 

Melissa's heart thumped in her chest. She could hear a roaring in her ears as an arterial burst of reckless lust flooded her and heat exploded between her legs. Light-headed and giddy, her voice seemed to come from a place that, to her, sounded very far away. It also sounded strange -- thick and glutted, the voice of a woman with a sudden, desperate and overwhelming desire for fucking. 

Her father had been there; he'd hidden and watched her masturbate. Melissa's cheeks burned at the knowledge that she'd suspected his lurking presence and then so lewdly flaunted her sexuality, had basically put on a show for him. 

Far from being disgusted with herself -- or Eammon come to that -- Melissa found the whole episode wildly erotic. It might have been the sheer thrill of the forbidden, the lure of something so dark and illicit that motivated the girl ... But she wanted to do it again. 

A part of her knew the risk, understood in some lucid section of her brain what a huge gamble her next words were going to be. As though involved in an out-of- body experience the girl saw and heard herself, witnessed the scene as a third party. 

Melissa could see her father standing by the table, his jaw slack, eyes wide as he stared at the shorts in her hand. She watched her own mouth move, lips in slow motion while the sound came to her like an old seven-inch slowed to thirty-three RPM -- Words through water or swimming through treacle. 

"You saw, didn't you, Daddy? You watched." Her father's head moved in slow- motion. Up and down, up and down. "I'm going for that shower, Dad," Melissa drawled. And then she said it: "You can watch me if you want. I know you like to watch." 

8 

It took him a few seconds to realise his daughter was naked. What had grabbed all his attention was what she held in her hand so it took a moment to realise the girl wasn't wearing a stitch of clothing. 

Melissa had found the shorts, the ones all spattered with jizm. Shit, she had him sussed. 

"It was you. You were there..." Melissa accused. 

Eammon couldn't think fast enough, had no excuse to hand. Panic gripped him and he rose to his feet. 

"Mel ... Oh God, Mel." Eammon banged his hip on the table as he moved around it and didn't register the pain. "It isn't what you think," he babbled. "I ... I..." 

But she had him bang to rights. He'd known the girl had sensed a presence in the clearing. Hadn't he seen her poised for flight? It wasn't that he didn't have form; he had committed the same crime before. Melissa had known he'd been to the clearing in the past, of course she did, he'd confessed to it. 

His daughter's nakedness registered then, but it was she said and the way she said it that caused his cock to stiffen with such sudden urgency. 

"You saw, didn't you, Daddy? You watched." And Eammon nodded without realising that he was. "I'm going for a shower ... You can watch me if you want." 

Melissa turned and walked out of the room and, when Eammon caught a glimpse of tan-lines and taut buttocks, he gulped heavily. 

It took his brain a good half-a-minute to catch up with his penis. 

What had she just said? ... Watch her if he wanted? 

Eammon took a step, a stiff-legged lurch like Frankenstein's monster before he staggered across the room. 

He moved along the corridor and found her in the little cubicle, the door open while Melissa stood under the spray, the glass screen opaque. 

Water cascaded over the girl while she showered. She was turned away from her father, oblivious to him standing there goggle-eyed at the oh-so-feminine shape of her. 

And then she turned. 

Their eyes locked. 

"Melissa," Eammon gurgled. He cleared his throat and, above the hiss of the shower, called his daughter's name again. 

"Did you enjoy watching me this afternoon, Dad? Do you like seeing me like this?" 

Eammon sucked in a lungful of air humid through his nose when his daughter cupped her little tits in both hands. 

"Mel--" he croaked. 

"It looks like it, Daddy." Melissa pointed to the front of her father's shorts. "It looks to me as though you like watching me a lot. Are you excited?" 

"Mel ... Oh, Melissa..." Eammon groaned, powerless to utter nothing but his daughter's name. 

The shower snapped off when the girl turned the tap. She stood inside the cubicle, the glass dotted with drops of water, steam dissipating quickly. 

"I knew you were there, Dad. And I did what I did this afternoon because I wanted you to see." The glass door slid open and Melissa reached for a towel. "You liked watching, didn't you?" She towelled her hair with brisk rubs before moving closer to her immobile, slack-jawed father. "You liked it so much you did it too." 

Eammon gulped and looked to where the girl's hand pressed against the ridge at the front of his shorts. 

"You watched me, Daddy," the temptress whispered. "You watched me and you touched yourself at the same time. You came all over your shorts. 

"And you thought I'd be angry with you, didn't you? 

"Because you spied on me before. 

"But you were wrong. I'm not angry. Not at all. The thing is, truly, I was so hot because it was you watching me that I came so hard. I came and came, Daddy. 

"It was so hot, Dad, doing that and thinking about you being all stiff for me made me all squirmy and wet. 

"And now ... I want to watch you do it." 

Melissa had him unzipped and unbuttoned before Eammon could fathom what was going on. He blinked in surprise when his shorts pooled around his feet. 

"Fuck," Melissa muttered when she saw the huge, arrogant jut of her father's erection. "Daddy," she murmured, "your cock's massive." 

It all rose inside the man. All of it. He remembered Melissa's display in the clearing and understood she'd known he was there. She'd masturbated with the knowledge her own father was lurking in the undergrowth. His daughter had done all of it so she could show off. 

"You bitch," Eammon mumbled, "you dirty fucking bitch." 

Enflamed by her own passions, aroused beyond her experience at the sight of her father's impressive cock, Melissa's eyes flashed fire. She spat back," You're the nasty one, Daddy. You're the one who spied on his daughter." She gave a vehement nod, adding, "You pulled that thing, didn't you? You looked at me and tugged it 'til you came." 

"Yes," Eammon hissed, the sibilant drawn out in a viper's hiss. "You're so lovely, Mel. I couldn't help it--" 

"Show me," the girl said, interrupting her father. "Let me watch you." She flicked her fingers towards the bedroom. "Now." 

Nude, her hair lank and with her body still damp, Melissa moved past her father, her hip brushing his cock as she went. 

In a fugue of amazement, without truly understanding what was about to happen, Eammon followed. He found his daughter lying on the double bed, his bed, and the girl looked up at him, reclining on the pillow as she flaunted her sex at her father. 

With her legs wide, breasts bare and pert, the girl's stomach so spare of excess flesh it was merely bisected by a single crease of latitude that bisected her navel, Melissa offered the man a hot-eyed stare. 

He stood at the foot of the bed and watched his daughter split her labia with a finger, the cerise core of her taunting him as she splayed the lips and held herself open. 

"Look at me, Dad," Melissa said, her voice cracking. "Play with yourself. Let me see you do it. Look at me while you pull your cock." 

"Jesus," Eammon grunted. "No," he whispered. "I shouldn't..." 

But, even as he uttered the words, his actions contradicted the sentiment. 

"Yes, Daddy," Melissa breathed, eyes locked on her father's fingers closing around the girth of that terrible thing. "Wank your big dick." Her finger moved over her clitoris and she winced. "Wank it, Dad. Pull that big ... Fucking ... Thing." Melissa groaned and slid down the bed, hand busy between her legs, buttocks lifting as her hips thrust upwards. 

Eammon fisted his length, tugging at the gristle and mumbled incoherent mutterings of disbelief. 

"Melissa," he grunted. "I'm going to--" 

And the stuff pumped out of him, great gouts of semen that flicked from him and rained down onto the bed. 

A stray spurt splashed against his daughter's foot and the girl yelped, jerking the limb back as though scalded. 

"Oh God, oh fuck..." Melissa groaned. "Look at that stuff! Daddy," she mewled, chewing on her bottom lip, her eyes glazing. The girl's forearm moved with brisk action as her fingers swirled over her vulva. "Cum, so much cum. Fuck ... I'm coming, too!" 

"What have we done, Melissa?" Eammon breathed when the girl ceased writhing and moaning and his own climax had cooled. He slumped onto the bed at its foot. "That was just wrong ... We ... we never should have let it happen." 

Eammon's body tensed when his daughter's body moulded against his back. Her arms were around his neck, her face nuzzled against his shoulder. 

"But it did happen, Dad," Melissa muttered. "And I want to do it again. I loved it, I really loved it, Daddy. It was so sexy. Please, can't we do it again, later?" 

Eammon sighed, a rebuttal rising. They couldn't do it again. It was wrong, just plain wrong. This was his daughter! He should exercise some self-control. 

He swivelled, the intention being to flatly refuse. But when he saw the girl's face, looked into her eyes and then glanced at the youthful beauty of her nakedness as she knelt on the bed just inches away, he knew, with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, that he wouldn't be able to refuse his daughter. 

9 

Eammon Morgan woke with a start. He sprang upright, jack-knifing at the waist and sat up in bed with the covers bunched around his middle. 

"Morning, Dad," Melissa said, her pretty face wide open and smiling. 

The man blinked and watched his daughter saunter into the bedroom. 

"How do you feel?" she asked. "A few too many last night?" 

Eammon felt the mattress dip when the girl, nude, perched on the edge of the bed. He felt heavy, leaden, senses dulled by the gallon of beer he'd poured into his face the previous night. 

The ale hadn't helped. Not a bit of it. No matter how quickly he drank Eammon couldn't obliterate the knowledge of the sin he and his daughter had committed. He'd left the pub and reeled into the campsite, his tread heavy as he blundered through the kitchen-cum-diner to the caravan's toilet cubicle. He'd pissed like the proverbial racehorse, recycling the beer before stumbling into his bedroom.  

===

He half expected to find the girl in his bed, waiting, but had been relieved to find it empty. 

Now, in the light of another day, groggy and uncoordinated, he stared blearily at Melissa as the girl pouted at him, obviously amused. 

Melissa uncrossed her legs and poked at the untidy pile of her father's clothes with a toe. 

"Look at the state of this place." 

Eammon ignored the rebuke. 

"What do you want, Mel?" But he had a feeling he knew the answer already. 

"Are you horny in the morning, Daddy?" she breathed, eyes wide with contrived innocence. "I thought you might like me to lie next to you and we could have a little play together." She nudged her father with an elbow and yanked at the sheet covering him. "You really do have a big cock, Daddy. Why don't you give it a little tug? Make it all stiff?" 

"Mel. No. Stop it." 

But the girl was already stretching her lean body alongside his and Eammon found himself shifting his bulk to accommodate her. He groaned and shook his head when his daughter's legs fell open with boneless ease. Eammon cursed and licked his dry lips when Melissa slid a finger along the crease of her sex and gasped. 

A few seconds later and they were side-by-side, each watching the other masturbate. 

"Melissa," Eammon sighed, giving it one last attempt to bring their lewd games to a halt. "No, we can't..." 

"But I want to, Dad." The girl rolled onto her side and rested her head on one fist, elbow against the bed. "In fact..." 

When his daughter's fingers closed around his girth, Eammon boggled with disbelief. It was unthinkable -- his own daughter fisting his length! His cock looked huge in her tiny hand, the length of it exaggerated as she jacked the thing with vigorous strokes. 

Melissa stared at the cock in her fist, entranced while she worked at her father. 

"Let me do it, Daddy," she murmured, "let your little girl milk this big fucking thing." 

Eammon boggled into the girl's face. 

"Jesus, Melissa. Oh shit. No, I don't believe it. Not you. You can't be doing this to me." 

"I am, Dad. I'm really doing it." Melissa shifted against the mattress and, still tugging away, leaned over her father's torso. She draped her body across his and aimed the cock-head at her breasts. "You can come on my boobs, Dad," she offered, pausing mid-stroke to paint her breasts with pre-cum as it leaked from the slit in the head of Eammon's cock. She using the thing like a stick of deodorant and rolled the big dome over her flesh. "Just let it go, Dad. When you're ready, don't hold back. Just let it go all over me." 

"My daughter? My own daughter? I'm damned..." Eammon delivered through gritted teeth, the cords in his neck stark as knife blades. 

Then, inevitably he bellowed and let fly with a long burst of semen that splashed against Melissa's throat. 

When semen splashed onto her, Melissa let out a cry of surprise, her fist working up and down while jet after jet of cum sprayed over her, its spread indiscriminate. 

By the time Eammon finished his groaning and gasping, lying there poleaxed, chest heaving, Melissa had been liberally plastered with viscous spunk. 

"I told you I wanted to do it again," the girl said, examining the web of her hand between forefinger and thumb. "You came everywhere," she laughed, wiping a gooey hand against her thigh before rolling off the bed. "I'm going to shower. Want to wash my back?" 

Minutes later a dazed Eammon padded along the corridor. He couldn't believe he was doing it but there he was just the same, reaching for the handle on the door to the shower cubicle. His daughter grinned and moved back inside the tiny stall and handed her father a bottle of body scrub a second before she turned her back to him. 

"Beautiful," Eammon muttered, when he felt his daughter's skin, slick and wet under his palms. 

He lathered the girl's back, his cock nudging the globe of one feminine buttock in the confined space. The thing thickened instantly; suddenly enormous and raring to go. 

Melissa turned when she felt a nudging in her back: "Oh, daddy ... Just look at you." 

Eammon moaned when the girl used both hands to soap his erection. 

"That's enough for now," Melissa said, manoeuvring around her father's bulk so she could exit the stall. "I'll wait for you in bed. Come to me soon." 

Eammon let the water spray over him, his mind full of contradictions as he lathered his body, legs and diminishing cock. He was torn between disgust at the appalling crime he and Melissa had committed and the nearly overwhelming desire for more of her. 

He thought again about leaving the caravan, imagined ways in which he could convince the girl to pack up and leave so they could drive home and he could make an early return to work. He thought that by immersing himself in some criminal investigation he could free his mind of his daughter, that by working and working he would stop thinking about her or obsessing over the enormity of their actions. 

The shower sluiced the suds away and Eammon left the stall. He wrapped a towel around his waist and brushed is teeth, spitting the foamy toothpaste residue into the sink, a renewed determination within him to put a stop to Melissa's seduction. 

Eammon walked to his bedroom. 

He opened the door and his mouth fell open. 

"I'm going to come, Daddy," the girl mumbled, two fingers knuckle deep inside her body, her face twisted with desire, her eyes glazed, jaw slack. 

"Oh, baby," Eammon moaned as the towel fell to the floor and his cock jerked, again, to a full-blooded hard-on. 

Melissa coughed a throaty groan and rolled her eyes, legs snapping closed around her wrist. She rolled onto her side and shuddered, the orgasm boiling inside her while her father slowly cranked his length and he stared at her, transfixed. 

Then, in a pivotal moment that would stay with him undiminished for life, Eammon watched his daughter uncurl and clamber to her knees. Melissa stepped off the bed and walked to her father, her hands going to his penis. 

"Kiss me, Daddy," she murmured, and their lips touched for the first time. 

10 

The kiss unlocked everything. 

Eammon's obstinate reticence burned away when his daughter's tongue slid into his mouth. His hands were all over her as the kiss deepened, lust for the girl a phosphorous flare inside him. 

Eammon squeezed the globes of Melissa's bottom, the pliant sponginess of those cheeks a thrill under his touch. His hands slid along her flanks gliding along the bare-skinned sweep of her hips to the narrowness of Melissa's waist. Fingers tightened over taut breasts while a single arm encircled the girl, her fist working at the solid length of her father's meat - And the kiss went on and on. 

With the barriers of convention knocked flying, Eammon broke the kiss. He pushed at Melissa's shoulder and sent her backwards onto the bed. In an instant he was there between her legs, his knees on the rough carpet, with that slit - - cerise pink and so wet -- in front of him as he held his daughter's thighs apart. 

"Oh, fuck ... Daddy!" Melissa yelped, the cry of delight bursting out of her. She lifted herself up onto her elbows and looked down along the length of her body. "You're licking me." 

Deaf to his daughter's excited squeal, all senses overwhelmed, Eammon slid his tongue between sticky labia and flicked the tip across the nub of the girl's clitoris. He sucked at her flesh, tormenting Melissa with his mouth, probing at her opening and flapping his tongue all over her down there. 

Melissa, after two full minutes of pleasure, her own father's mouth at her sex, hauled Eammon up so she could kiss him and taste herself on his lips. 

In a lust-fuelled daze, still not quite comprehending exactly what he was doing, Eammon pulled back. Their lips parted with a plop and, mindless, Eammon scrambled onto the bed, his hips between his daughter's thighs. 

And when he slid into the girl's opening, her body accepting him in one slick glide, Eammon held himself over the girl on straight arms, his eyes locked on her disbelieving stare. 

"We're fucking," Melissa gurgled, blinking. She gaped down at where her body accommodated her father's cock, stunned at the actuality of it. "Dad," she gasped, amazed. "We're fucking. You're inside me." 

"Baby," Eammon mumbled, and then groaned when Melissa's hips began to rock. "Oh, baby, I love you." 

Melissa thrust upwards, her buttocks coming off the bed, thrilled by the sensation of being filled with the man's erect cock. 

"I love you, too. I'm full of you. It feels so good. Oh, fuck ... Dad, it's really you. We're doing it. It feels so good to have you inside me." 

The girl's legs widened and her feet lifted. She offered herself to her father, her eyes fixed on that point where her flesh bulged around him. Melissa watched her labia cling to the shaft, her desire slick and glistening, shiny when her father's dick slipped from her opening during the outstroke. 

"I can't keep going," Eammon gasped. "Melissa, baby, I'm going to come again." 

Melissa reached up and, maintaining the urgent rhythm of thrusting hips, pulled her father's face towards her. "Come, Daddy," she breathed, grunting into the man's open mouth, her tongue sliding over his, kissing her father while the hot stuff pumped into her and adoration for him burst in her chest. 

11 

"Here we are. You don't have to spy on me, either." Melissa chuckled, she enjoyed teasing her father. 

Eammon pulled a face. 

"Ha-ha ... Don't be facetious, young lady; you can have a spanked bottom, you know." 

"I might like that, Daddy." The girl batted her eyelids. 

"I can't believe you've brought me here," Eammon said, casting an anxious eye around the clearing. "I don't know if it's a good idea." 

Melissa, quickly out of her clothes, posed for her father, grinning at him and making sure he took a good, long look at her nudity. 

"Come on." She lay on the outspread towel. "Take your clothes off. Get down here and let me play with you. I'll suck you and get you so hot you won't be able to stop yourself." 

Desire for his daughter surged through Eammon and he began to work on his cock. His penis thickened at Melissa's suggestion, the reluctance fading, and it was much later before the man was kneeling on the towel, the girth of him distorting Melissa's face. 

"My mother must be crazy," the girl gasped after her father's appendage plopped from between her lips. "I'd never let a man with a gorgeous cock like this get away." She rolled away and levered herself onto all fours, her rump swaying side-to-side, hips rocking as she offered herself. "Put it in, Dad. Fuck your daughter again." 

Eammon got behind Melissa and took hold of his cock. He gave it a few quick tugs, resisting the urge to wank to orgasm and spray the girl's back with semen. Instead he nudged her body with the blunt head of his penis. 

They groaned together, Eammon leaning back, thrusting deep while Melissa clenched around him. The girl gasped and grunted and muttered obscenities when she felt her father stretching her, that thing forcing deeper, stretching her and stuffing her with meat. 

Melissa's fingers clawed at the towel, her head lolling. 

"Fuck, Daddy ..." she hissed, craning her neck to look back at him, face twisted. "This is so good. We're naked outdoors and we're doing it." The girl grunted and steadied herself on straight arms when her father thrust into her with several fast pushes. Her buttocks rippled under the force of the impact and she moaned again. 

They went at it with Melissa urging her father on to greater efforts, goading him and pouring fuel onto the fire of his arousal with a torrent of potty- mouthed exhortation. 

"You shouldn't swear," Eammon said as he withdrew and flipped his daughter onto her back. "It's dirty and nasty and you sound like a slut." 

Melissa merely lifted her feet and opened her legs, exposing the gash of her sex -- scarlet and heavy-lipped, labia pouting and slippery -- to her father's eyes. 

"You like me playing the slut really, Daddy. I know you do. Besides, I'm your slut." She splayed the folds with her fingers. "Now fuck me some more. Come for me." 

Eammon growled and hooked Melissa's legs around his arms. He held her wide and pushed into her, goaded by her words. 

His daughter, now that he'd capitulated and accepted the incestuous coupling, aroused Eammon with a strength of passion he'd known to exist but which had faded to a vague recollection, the power diminished, faded from years of marriage. Eammon couldn't blame Julia, he was just as guilty of allowing the polish on their relationship to tarnish -- in fact, if anything Eammon was more to blame than his wife -- but, as he pumped into the girl, determined to fulfil her need for rough sex, all the desire and fire of lust came back to him. He was growing used to Melissa's need, her whims, and he knew that dirty talk meant hard and fast. 

There were times for tenderness, but this wasn't one of them. 

"Come for me, Daddy," Melissa repeated. She had a hand between them, her fingers busy on her clit. "Fill me up with spunk. Put a baby inside me." 

Eammon halted, his cock buried inside the girl to the hilt. He swallowed heavily and looked down into the blue eyes returning his stare. 

"We used to role-play," he began. "Your mother and I used to pretend." 

Melissa gulped and wriggled beneath her father, hefting herself onto her elbows. 

Intuiting that some revelation was forthcoming, sensing the shift in her father's mood, the girl began to rock her hips gently, watching him when she whispered, "What about? What was it about, Dad?" 

Moving in time with his daughter, his length slowly gliding out and then in, with a pause when his pubis pressed against the girl's tacky vulva for a kiss, Eammon told her. 

"We'd pretend ... When we hadn't been married very long ... That your mother - - well, she wasn't a mother then ... But we'd pretend that she was my sister." 

A long pause while the couple kissed and Eammon thrust heartily for half-a- dozen strokes. 

"Your sister?" Melissa breathed, agog when the kiss broke. 

Eammon nodded, returning to the slow glide in and out. "I can't remember who started it, but there we were pretending we were brother and sister. Your mother loved it. It turned her on so much she went nuts for it." 

The rhythm between them picked up tempo. 

"Why..." Melissa gasped, "...Why are you telling me this?" She grunted and pulled her father's face down for another kiss. 

"Because that's what she said, Mel. Just like you did." 

Unable to hold himself in check, Eammon began to ride the girl harder. Melissa reciprocated, her buttocks coming up to meet her father's downstroke. 

"That bit about coming," the man continued, his sentences delivered in short bites. "About coming inside her ... About filling her with cum ... That's what your mother said when ... when we pretended to be related ... She told me to cum inside her ... And put a baby there..." 

They were rocking and heaving against each other then, both riding toward a climax. 

The thought of her father's sperm finding her and making a baby was the single most arousing thing that Melissa could envision sexually. It was appalling to think of, her own father's semen impregnating her, but it was also wicked and depraved and oh-so-fucking-sexy! 

"Fuck ... Daddy," the girl grunted. "That's so ... It's just so ... I love it," she squealed. "Do it, Daddy. Come inside me." 

Her father's next words got her there, took Melissa over the edge and into the pit. 

"It's how we made you, baby," he gurgled, the skin of his face a tight while Eammon struggled to hold back the deluge. "We were pretending to be brother and sister when your mum got pregnant." 

And he let it go, squirting the hot stuff into his daughter while Melissa writhed and grunted beneath him. 

12 

The call came during the early evening. 

Father and daughter were naked, as was their new arrangement inside the caravan. It was a scene of easy domesticity, each comfortable in the company of the other. 

"Pizza for tea, again?" Melissa suggested after peering into the freezer compartment of the fridge. "Or shall we go over to the pub instead?" 

Eammon grinned and said the pub would be his choice, adding, "But we'd better put some clothes on." 

Then Melissa's mobile rang. The device had been largely silent during the holiday, all the girl's friends knew she was away but there had been the occasional text or quick call. 

"It's Mum," Melissa breathed, her head snapping up as she looked to her father for guidance. "What shall I do?" 

"I ... I don't know, Mel. What do you feel like doing?" Eammon's stomach slid greasily. Suddenly confronted with the reality of what he'd done, after resisting the invasive probing of what might happen in the future, preferring to focus on the here-end-now of life with Melissa in the caravan, Julia's phone call sent a frisson of fear through the man. 

He saw Melissa hesitate, sensed that conflicting thoughts tumbled in her mind and wondered what she would do. 

"We're at the caravan park," Melissa intoned after finally answering. A pause. "We're great. We don't need you ... I don't need Ben." An exasperated sigh. "Just leave us alone." Melissa ended the call. 

"Are you all right?" asked Eammon, feeling shaky at the real-life reminder himself. 

"Yep. Fine." 

And the girl grinned at him, but Eammon had no idea what would occur to his daughter now that Julia had reminded them both of her existence. 

Part Three 

1 

They met at the Costa in town. 

It was a tense moment for Julia, a meeting she'd been eagerly anticipating but also dreading in equal measure. As she stood at the counter and watched the barista at work in front of the vast array of chrome pipes, the girl working with deft, efficient movements to produce the latte, Julia felt the weight of her daughter's eyes on her back. 

It had been three weeks since her betrayal and a scrawled confession left behind in the caravan. There had been no word from either Melissa or Eammon, no contact other than a brief, frustrating phone call. A call made by Julia herself that had left her emotionally adrift. 

Then, out of the blue, Melissa had rung and suggested they meet. 

"For a coffee and a chat," the girl had said. "Tomorrow?" 

"What time?" Julia replied. "I'll be at work but will drop whatever I have to." If it meant building bridges with her daughter, Julia would have taken a whole day off. She had capable staff in the estate agent franchise she ran, time off wouldn't be an issue. 

They arranged a time and, with elephants' feet dancing in the pit of her stomach, Julia duly arrived at the Costa Coffee outlet not far from her office. 

The coffee arrived at the serving point and Julia sighed, she couldn't prevaricate forever. It was time to face her daughter. Paradoxically torn between dread at facing Melissa and her maternal desire to mend things between them, Julia swallowed down the trepidation that swelled in her throat and turned, a smile stretched across her face. 

"Hello, Melissa," she said, feeling so awkward standing in front of the girl and attempted to gauge her mood. 

Melissa nodded, saying, "Hi, Mum." She pointed at the chair opposite her place at the table. "Sit down, eh?" 

Now that the moment had arrived, regardless of all the muttered rehearsals she'd practiced all morning, Julia felt herself at a loss for words. After all, what the hell did she say to the young woman sitting opposite? 

Silence stretched between them, several elastic seconds that, as each one ticked by, only exacerbated Julia's anxiety. She chanced a quick look at Melissa and noticed that her daughter seemed remarkably unperturbed. Julia had expected hostility, slit-eyed, spitting recrimination, not this cool detachment. 

Wrong-footed by her daughter's composure, Julia heard herself blurt, "Have you heard from Ben?" She winced internally -- What an idiot thing to say. Why bring up his name?  

===

Melissa served up a shrug of indifference and pulled a face. 

"He didn't have the balls to phone me or send a text." 

Julia sipped the latte, observing Melissa over the rim of the tall glass. 

"Y-you seem quite cool about it." she stuttered. 

Melissa tilted her head to one side and smirked. 

"That's because I'm not bothered anymore." 

Julia frowned at the sly expression, puzzled by Melissa's demeanour. Surely there had to be some reaction to Ben's departure? Julia had fucked the girl's boyfriend, offered herself up to Ben and betrayed both Melissa and Eammon in one go. She suspected a trap, an ambuscade from where the girl must have a stone of some withering reproach to hurl at the woman who'd led her boyfriend to do the dirty. 

Julia shook her head, confused. 

"What do you mean?" she responded, waiting for the assault. 

"I mean, I'm not bothered about Ben." Melissa chuckled and shook her head, grimacing to indicate her disdain. She shrugged again. "I admit I was hurt and upset at first, sure. But Dad made me see just how lucky I was. After all, I hardly knew Ben, not really. I think I built up this ... expectation while we were writing to each other. And then, when I saw him..." 

The girl paused and blurted a laugh towards her mother. 

Julia heard the irony in the sound. 

"...Well, you know for yourself how hot he was, Mum," the girl added. A short pause during which Melissa threw her mother a pointed look, eyebrows arched before her next words poured out of her like treacle. "Don't you, Mother? You saw how good-looking and fit he was." Melissa leaned across the table, her eyes locked on Julia's. "And you couldn't keep your hands off his big dick." 

Heat flooded Julia's cheeks. She was both embarrassed and appalled by her daughter's crude yet oh-so-true statement. 

"Mel--" 

"Feeling guilty, Mum?" Melissa asked. She eased back into her seat after cutting short Julia's blurt of denial "You should. Not because of Ben. He's history. Forgotten." The girl gave an airy wave. "But doing that to dad...?" She clicked her tongue and shook her head, disgust in her eyes as she pouted at her mother. 

"Oh God," Julia groaned, certain that Melissa's calm appearance, the cool mask of detachment she wore was about to be ripped away to reveal the face of the beast. She flinched and stuttered, "How ... how is he? Your father, is he all right?" 

Julia noticed that sly smirk flit across her daughter's face once more. 

"He's okay, Mum. No problems at all for Dad. In fact, we're getting on so much better these days. I've seen him in a different light and ... and ... well, Mum, I actually like him now." 

Julia blinked, obviously surprised. "You've changed your tune. You couldn't stick him before." 

A laugh bubbled from Melissa's throat. "Didn't you hear me, Mum? I said I've seen him in a different light. We're getting on well. We're closer than we've ever been." 

Another pause laden with meaning stretched between the two women. It felt, to Julia, that an undercurrent of something not quite right swirled below the surface. There was more to this than a simple change of heart by Melissa, Julia intuited. And what was that knowing grin about? The odd, vulpine cast to Melissa's features, like she knew a dirty secret about her mother, was very disconcerting. 

"Really, really close," the girl added. 

Melissa sipped her coffee and thought about telling her mother everything. She could just let it all spill out, right there in the coffee shop. She wondered what her mother's reaction would be. Would Julia hold it all together in public? Would she even believe it? After all, Melissa could hardly believe it herself. 

"Well, I'm ... uhm ... I'm glad about that," Julia responded, puzzled by her own unease -- A leaden ball that had thunked into the pit of her stomach. Disquiet rippled in her guts. Something was off. Melissa seemed altered in a way that Julia couldn't fathom. 

"Would you like to come to the house?" Melissa asked, the question stunning her mother. "You can see Dad yourself. He'd love to talk to you and let you see that he's fine." 

A bare-faced lie, her father didn't know anything it. 

Julia's mouth worked up and down for a few seconds. Her daughter had said 'the house', not 'home', she noticed. 

"Oh, Mel, I don't know. It might be too soon. I wouldn't want to cause your father any upset. What I did was terrible, I feel so bad about it." 

She reached a hand across the table, continuing when fingers rested on the back of her daughter's hand, the need to purge herself of the guilt swelled inside her and the words came bubbling out. 

"I was so lonely ... So desperate. I didn't mean for it to happen with Ben." Blinking, Julia shook her head and squeezed Melissa's hand. "No," she added, blurting the word. "That's not quite true. I did mean for it to happen. I wanted to do what I did with him. But when I did it I was in a place where I wasn't thinking straight. 

"He was so gorgeous and sexy ... And your father had been ignoring me for months. Seeing Ben, seeing his lovely body and the way he flirted with me turned my head. I was ripe for an affair, Mel. I wanted him and I went for him. Oh God," Julia croaked, close to tears, her eyes red-rimmed, "I'm sorry for what I did to you, Melissa, but I couldn't help myself." 

Melissa, on a rush of empathy, she knew how it felt to be carried away by emotions so strong that, even as it was happening you knew it wasn't right, turned her hand and gave her mother's fingers a squeeze. 

"That's all right, Mum," she breathed. "Honest, it's all okay. Forget Ben and forget what happened. I didn't love him or anything." Melissa leaned in close again, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "It might only be a couple of weeks since it all happened, Mum, but I've changed ... I've changed a lot. Dad's changed, too. Things aren't the same as they were. I can understand why you did what you did, Mum." 

Julia saw honesty in her daughter's eyes; she listened to the girl's words and was amazed at how mature Melissa sounded. With a start Julia realised that her little girl had grown up and now possessed wisdom beyond her eighteen years. 

Julia's eyes welled with tears when Melissa added, "I can forgive you for what happened with Ben, Mum. It isn't important now." 

She studied her daughter's face for several beats, her heart swelling with love. Pride at how well Melissa had turned out squeezed Julia's throat. 

"Oh, Mel--" 

"The past doesn't matter anymore, Mum," Melissa interrupted. "I'm different, Dad's different..." Her fingers traced light patterns over the back of her mother's hands. "We both miss you," she whispered, wondering if her nose was growing. After all these lies it should be a foot long. "We want you to come home. Please, come home and see for yourself. I promise you, Dad's fine; he wants to see you. 

Come on, Mum, Melissa cajoled in a gentle voice. "Come to the house tonight. Please." 

Julia, after a few second's pause for thought, sniffed and nodded. Home, she could go home. Tears and a sob of relieved laughter hiccupped out of Julia. Her daughter had forgiven her and it sounded like Eammon had done the same, or was at least willing to try. She dabbed the heel of one hand at her eyes. 

"Okay," Julia blubbed. 

"That's great, Mum. Really great." 

Melissa sipped her coffee and anticipated her next move. She hadn't much of a clue what she could do next, there was no real plan, but she was sure that she could make something happen. The question was would the whole thing blow up in her face? 

2 

When Julia recovered her composure they made the arrangements: she would go to the house, her former home, the place she'd shared with her family before her stupid infatuation with Ben had forced her to seek refuge at her business partner's flat. 

She showered and thought about the aftermath of her liaison with the soldier, about the cowardly relief when they'd returned to find the caravan empty. Mortification gripped her, a visceral squeeze when she remembered the scribbled explanation, a hasty confession before fleeing the scene, heading for the train station. 

They'd travelled together as far as Clapham Junction -- Julia tormented while Ben remained largely unaffected. Ben had left the train after throwing a shrug at the anguished woman in the seat opposite. 

"Sorry about the way things turned out," he'd offered. Pathetic really. 

Julia gave no response to the lame apology other than a shrug. She didn't look at the young man when he left her alone, and the last she'd seen of Ben was a quick movement out of the corner of her eye as he walked past the carriage. Then she was on her own. Truly alone as journeyed on to Vauxhall where she caught an underground train to King's Cross for the final leg towards who knew what. 

Julia had been surprised when she heard nothing from Eammon. She had thought he'd make a fuss, ringing her mobile and demanding an explanation. He might have neglected her in recent months, but Julia knew her husband, knew he was a control freak and would have gone spare at her walking out. He might not want her but Julia was sure Eammon wouldn't allow her to just up and leave, not unless he'd been the one doing the throwing out. His ego and governing nature wouldn't allow it. 

But it appeared she'd misjudged her husband. There hadn't been a word from him. 

Finally, after four days of nothing, pressing down on the guilt that rose so savagely inside her, Julia took several deep breaths and picked up her mobile phone to call Melissa. It took four aborted attempts during which her thumb hovered over the speed-dial key that wold connect her to her daughter before Julia found the nerve to press the button. 

"We're at the caravan park," Melissa had informed her. "We're great. We don't need you ... I don't need Ben." And then, with an exasperated sigh, Melissa had ended the call. "Just leave us alone," she'd said, hanging up to leave Julia gawping at the handset. 

Then the call had come, the offer to meet and subsequent invitation. 

Julia dressed in loose-fitting chinos and wife-beater vest. She'd dropped pounds with worry over the last couple of weeks and she felt good, physically that was, emotionally she wasn't too sure. But as she checked her reflection Julia nodded with approval -- She still had the curves but appeared leaner, fitter, and, she hoped, sexier. Julia had a vague notion, optimism even, that the whole ordeal might bring some positive result, perhaps reconciliation with Eammon. Hadn't Melissa said he was looking forward to seeing her? That he missed her? That he'd changed? 

There were a few questions lurking in the dusty corners of her mind: Melissa's grin had disturbed Julia on some primordial level, caused anxiety that she didn't fully acknowledge consciously. Still, the amorphous unease was there, a weight in her guts and Julia hoped her visit would yield some explanations as she decided, focussing on more concrete matters, to leave her shoulder length hair loose. 

Proper questions sprung to mind, real issues: Was Eammon really reconciled to her walking out? Did her husband not harbour any ill-feeling at her infidelity? Was Melissa as settled as she'd appeared in Costa? Had she honestly forgiven her mother for the betrayal? Did they really, both of them, want her back? 

An unsettling thought: Was this just some elaborate scheme to lure her into a meeting where her husband and daughter could vilify her face-to-face? 

"Don't be so bloody ridiculous," Julia muttered. "How fucking paranoid is that?" 

Julia grabbed the keys to the Mini, slipped her mobile phone into her pocket and left the flat, steeling her resolve at the prospect of coming face-to-face with Eammon after three weeks of silence. 

3 

While his wife deliberated and prepared herself for the visit, Eammon, ignorant of the forces working behind the scenes, stroked his cock and watched his daughter as she undressed. 

He loved seeing her nude. 

Melissa saw her father sprawled on the bed, the huge king-size that he'd shared with her mother, the bed she now slept in. She chuckled and rolled her eyes, deliberately turning to face him, provoking a reaction. The girl posed, hands on hips. Let him see the tan lines he raved about. There you go, Dad, get a good long look at that smooth pussy. 

Eammon groaned and licked his lips, his stare lasering over his daughter's lush body. 

"Come here," he growled. 

"But I need a shower, Dad. I'm all sweaty I want to be beautiful for you tonight." She turned, knowing the sight of her buttocks would only inflame him more; she anticipated her father's response, was certain of his reply. 

He didn't disappoint, so predictable. 

"You're already beautiful." Eammon's words slid out of him, thick and hot with lust. "I could watch you walking around in the nude all day, baby. You're gorgeous. A daughter any man would be proud of." 

Melissa turned to face her father again. The sight of his cock -- thick and heavy and so fucking ready for her -- and the husky timbre of his voice made her tummy flip over. She glanced at the digital clock on the bedside table, made a quick time appreciation. 

"Am I really beautiful, Daddy?" the girl pouted, lisping and giving her father the wide-eyed innocent look she knew would get him even hotter. 

Eammon's fist cranked more urgently at his length. He swallowed and blew out a heavy sigh. 

"You're so lovely, baby. I can't get enough of you." 

"You just want to put that big thing inside me. Don't you, Daddy? You want to fuck my little pussy with your big dick." 

Melissa moved across the room. She clambered onto the bed and reached for her father's erection. 

Eammon grunted when his daughter's fingers closed around his girth. 

"Mel ... Oh, Jesus, baby that's nice," He enjoyed the breathy lisp Melissa used. It made him so fucking hot for her. 

"You're just a dog, Dad," Melissa said, dropping the breathy innocence. "You just want my body." She began to work at her father's hard-on as she kneeled above him. "But I know how that feels," she added. "Right now, I just want to see your big dick squirt cum. Let me wank it out of you." Melissa turned on the sweet-voiced innocence again. "Show me the hot stuff, Daddy." 

The girl leaned lower and kissed her father's mouth, their tongues dancing slick and wet. His hands went to her body, and Eammon moaned when he felt the silky texture of his daughter's skin under his palms. 

"I love you, Melissa," Eammon sighed. 

"And I love you, Daddy." 

She kissed her father's mouth again before, her hand continuing to stroke Eammon's erection, coaxing low moans and the occasional grunt, she lay alongside him. The girl levered herself up on one elbow and popped the swollen dome of the cock-head between her lips. She sucked at her father's flesh, her fingers massaging his penis at the root. 

"Come for me, Daddy," Melissa mumbled. She gave her father the look, her mouth distorted with cock as she blinked up at him. 

Eammon's buttocks lifted from the bed, his hips jerking in a convulsive action. The girl was simply fantastic. The way she looked, the way she moved, the way she spoke. All of it enflamed him, filled him with a lust so hot and bright he just couldn't keep his hands off her. Eammon had spoken the truth -- he just couldn't get enough of his own daughter. 

He'd tried to resist the lure, tried so hard to push the carnal thoughts from his mind. But he couldn't put the scene out of his mind, couldn't erase the images of Melissa in that clearing near the beach when she'd been naked with Ben, nude and so fucking beautiful. 

The corrosive emotion burned in his guts at the reminder of that man, but Eammon swallowed it down, choked on it as he pushed the thought of Ben from his mind. That was over and done, Ben was history, finished business. The most important thing was Melissa. And their secret. 

They had moved on. Melissa and he had agreed to leave the past behind. 

Eammon pictured Melissa again, as she'd been the day he'd first encountered her, the late morning he'd spied on her. His daughter had been so lovely, so damn beautiful nude in the open air. Watching her as she'd knelt and offered herself to that man, her body taking his dick and then witnessing their simultaneous climax, knowing that his daughter was being filled with the soldier's jizm had affected Eammon on a deep and primal level. 

He'd been jealous. Of all the emotions he'd experienced immediately after the event, jealousy was the strongest. He'd watched the young couple rutting and been overcome by the desire to be the one doing that to such a lovely girl. Eammon wanted to stick his cock into his own daughter. He wanted to be the one to make her groan and sigh and climax so noisily. Eammon wanted to let go and flood the girl's body with his seed. 

Of course there was also the guilt, especially after he'd used Julia, fucked into her while thinking of Melissa all the time they were at it. 

And then, with the unforeseen developments, Julia's infidelity and subsequent departure, the soldier running too, Eammon and his daughter had grown closer. 

Eammon writhed on the bed and stared, still not quite believing it was his hard-on in his daughter's mouth, while Melissa's lips and hand coaxed an orgasm from her father. 

The girl felt the dome swell in her mouth, heard the deep, guttural grunt and knew her dad was about to squirt viscous goo. 

"Come for me, Daddy," she repeated, her fist working briskly. She opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue as the first spurt flicked out of her father. 

Melissa took that squirt on her tongue, swirling the goo around her mouth while more of the stuff spattered across her cheek. She swallowed her father's ejaculate before yelping with delight, so joyful that she could give the man such pleasure. 

She loved her father with an intensity that shocked her whenever she thought about the sudden twist her life had taken. Memories of loving him with her body, the giving and receiving of pleasure and making him happy suffused Melissa with a deep and satisfying warmth. 

"Melissa," Eammon groaned. "Oh, baby, wow..." 

"I definitely need to shower now," the girl replied with a grin. 

Eammon smiled down at his daughter's face. He saw his own semen glistening on her cheek and pointed at the thick, silvery ropes clinging to her hair. 

"You need to wash your hair, too." 

With a sigh of feigned exasperation, Melissa shook her head. She rolled away from her father, saying, "I should have just climbed on and fucked you." 

Eammon laughed and watched his daughter's rump as she walked to the en-suite. Then, when the door closed, Eammon's head went back to the pillow. Anxiety rippled in his stomach when he thought about how life would be if anyone ever found out about the incest. He wondered about how it had all happened in the first place, considered how quickly it had all come about and worried that things might have gone too far too quickly. 

But he knew he couldn't have stopped it. 

And that things would never be the same again. 

Not that Eammon particularly wanted to go back to the way it had been: exhausted, emotionally drained by the compulsion to protect Melissa that had bordered on obsession. He didn't want a life as it had been. He liked it the way it was now, altered beyond all recognition. 

And there was the secret he shared with Melissa. That had to be protected. Nobody could ever find out about that. 

Eammon sighed, thinking back to the courting of his own daughter, their dance towards incest in which she'd done the leading. His penis twitched and thickened, as it always did when he recalled their first time, how she'd looked and tasted, the sounds she'd made and the way his daughter's pussy had opened up for him. 

"Oh, Mel..." the man mumbled, both fearful and excited at the future he envisioned for himself and his girl.  

===

An hour later, Eammon, seated in his favourite chair in front of the television, a can of lager thoughtfully supplied by his daughter, turned his head in the direction of the front door. 

"I'll get it!" Melissa called when the bell rang. 

4 

"Did you do this? Did you set this up?" 

Melissa rolled her eyes at her father's outburst. All that progress and he was back to his old self, as though the three of them under the one roof brought out the bad side to Eammon's personality. 

Melissa reached for the remote control and pointed it at the television. 

Silence until the girl said in a cool, calm voice purposely used to soothe her father, "Dad," do you trust me?" 

Eammon's mouth opened and closed. He grimaced, seemed on the point of blurting an objection but simply flapped his arms in a gesture of either defeat or exasperation instead. He slumped back into the chair he'd shot out of at Julia's appearance. 

Julia herself, taken aback by the unexpected reaction from her husband, said, "I thought you said--" 

She cast a nervous look from her husband to her daughter. 

"There are things we need to sort out," interjected Melissa, a hand by her face, palm out, eyes closed, and with her whole demeanour suggesting she was accepting no argument from either parent. "You," she snapped at Eammon, jutting her chin at the man. "Get Mum a drink. Get me one, too." 

There was a pause while Eammon digested the barked instruction. To Julia he seemed on the cusp of exploding, giving vent to a rage, but, to her astonishment, eliciting a small smirk of satisfaction from his daughter, Eammon rose from his seat. 

A terse, clipped question: "What would you like, Julia?" 

Melissa was delighted. Okay, her father might be frosty, but she would work on him. She would work on both of them. 

"Get her a gin and tonic, Dad. And, Mum, close your mouth, eh. You look silly like that." 

"What did you do to him?" Julia asked as she stared at the door leading to the kitchen, the portal through which her husband had walked on route to his errand. 

Melissa laughed. "Sit down, Mum." She gestured to the sofa with a sweep of an arm. "Let's all get used to being together, eh?" 

Following a quick double take in Melissa's direction (there was that odd smirk again) Julia settled into the seat. 

"Is everything all right, Mel?" The woman flicked an uneasy look towards the kitchen. "I thought you said he wanted to see me, that he would be pleased." 

"Just go with it, Mum. I had to say that, eh, otherwise, would you be here now?" 

Julia paused and pondered the veracity of that. 

"Well, okay, yes, I see your point. But I don't think I should stay long." Julia looked at her daughter askance. "But the way you just ordered him to get me a drink ... And he did it! Wow, Mel, you said he'd changed, but..." 

"Told you, Mum." Melissa took the seat next to her mother, relaxing against the corner and angling herself at forty-five degrees towards Julia, one leg folded with the foot under a buttock. "Just sit tight and leave it to me. I'll work on Dad." After a brief moment of silence and a long exhale now that she had her mother ensconced on the settee and her father mixing drinks, Melissa added, "This is nice, eh?" 

In the meantime, in the kitchen, gripped by anxiety, worried about the apparent conspiracy between Melissa and her mother, Eammon poured gin, chinked ice cubes into glasses, mixed in tonic water and sliced lemon. 

What the fuck was Melissa thinking? Inviting Julia to the house ... What if the girl said or did something inappropriate? She was only eighteen and capable of anything, especially with a drink inside her. 

He could see it all going tits up, the wheels falling off the wagon. He had to get back into the living room and try to deflect any awkward moments as best he could. He could get rid of Julia. It would be easy enough to send her packing. 

But Melissa, it seemed, wanted her mother there. What would she do if Eammon started with the heavy attitude? 

"Shit, shit ... SHIT!" Eammon hissed, worried at his potential future. He wondered if Peru would be a good place to hide. 

"You look good, Mum," Eammon heard Melissa say as he re-entered the living room. "Doesn't she, Dad? Doesn't Mum look gorgeous?" 

Eammon handed a glass beaded with sweat to his wife. He had to concede that Julia did look good. Her clothes, the cargo pants, bare feet in silver sandals, wife-beater vest and loose hair suited her. 

"You've lost weight," he remarked. 

Julia accepted the glass. "Thank you. Cheers." She took a hefty swig and swallowed. "I suppose it's all the worry. I haven't eaten much lately." Her face titled towards her lap. "I'm so sorry about it all. I ... I was such an idiot..." 

"You don't have to think about all that now, Mum," Melissa remarked as she smiled up at her father and winked. She took her own drink when the man offered it to her. "We're over that -- aren't we, Dad?" 

Eammon hesitated. "Well, uhm..." 

"Get another beer, Dad," Melissa instructed. "Relax. Calm down." 

To her continued astonishment at the way Eammon complied with their daughter's commands, Julia gave a tiny shake of her head. "It isn't him, is it? The aliens have taken the real Eammon Morgan away and left this shell behind instead." 

"It's him, Mum. But he's changed. Like I said in Costa, we've both changed." 

"You also said he missed me," Julia shot back. "But he wasn't very welcoming when I got here." 

Melissa leaned forward and, stretching across the gap between them, patted her mother's leg. "Are you happy with the way things are?" she asked, giving Julia's calf a squeeze before nestling into the corner of the sofa again. "Bunking in at Francine's place? Do you like the way your life's turning out?" 

Eammon reappeared as Julia sniffed and dabbed at her eyes with the back of a hand. 

"No," the woman mumbled, sniffing again. "Of course not. It's horrible ... The way we are. But I couldn't live like we were anymore." 

Eammon felt the blade of remorse slide beneath his breastbone when Julia turned a stricken face towards her him. He'd done this to her. He'd been so focussed on work and Melissa, obsessed by desire to control her and torn by jealousy at the arrival of Ben on the scene, that he'd neglected his wife. This was his fault. 

As was the incest. 

The word hit him, the full meaning and implication of what had occurred between him and his daughter slammed into him like a train. 

And what had Julia done to deserve his neglect? Nothing, she hadn't done a thing wrong. The realisation dawned that it was he who'd been instrumental in creating the rift in their marriage. He'd let things slide by spending more and more time at work, chasing a promotion to Chief Inspector. He was almost there, too, so close to furthering his career that, apart from his overblown need to protect his daughter, nothing else mattered. 

Wasn't he taking care of Julia by ensuring he achieved the maximum pension possible by jumping up a rank in the police force? 

No, Eammon had to admit, he wasn't looking after his wife at all. 

And now his wife, Julia, his lovely, neglected wife was sitting there, her mere presence an accusation. Eammon fidgeted and swigged beer. He'd been a pig, an arsehole and a wanker of Olympic proportions. 

But what could he do? What about the reaction -- a fucking whirlwind -- he'd receive from the people he knew if it ever got out that he'd slept with his daughter? 

What made it worse was it was all his doing, he was to blame. Eammon could see it all so clearly. 

After all, hadn't he been the one who'd spied on his daughter? Who was it who'd spied and lost control of his senses? And who had then succumbed to his base desires and masturbated while using a fantasy of his own daughter? 

It was he, Eammon Morgan, police inspector, husband and father who'd allowed it all to happen. 

"I'm sorry too!" Eammon blurted. "Julia ... Shit, Julia ... What have I done to us all?" 

Quick-wittedness on Melissa's part saved them from disaster. Sure that her father was about to let it all out she intervened. 

Melissa unfurled, placed the glass carefully onto the carpet and stood up. Going to her father she squatted in front of him and, with her forearms across his knees, looked up at him and said, "Dad, stop it. Don't take it all on like this. Things might have been awful back then, you might have been awful, but we're not bothered about what happened in the past. Remember? We've put all that away. What's important is now. 

"You weren't the best husband, you might not have been a great dad for the last couple of years, but it wasn't always like that. I remember you as I was growing up, and you told me how it was with you and Mum ... When you first got married. Remember that?" 

Eammon's eyes widened; he knew exactly what Melissa was referring to. 

"And Mum hasn't been blameless in it all, eh?" the girl continued. She threw a look over her shoulder and offered her mother a smile. "That thing with Ben was a mistake. But she's admitted to making it. And Mum's got a big enough heart to take responsibility. Right, Mum?" 

Julia looked startled. "Uh ... Oh, yes," she stuttered. "I told you I was sorry--" 

"You see, Dad," Melissa went on, overriding her mother, "Mum's sorry. You're sorry ... I'm sorry, too. I was a brat. I rubbed Ben in your face. I knew you were only trying to look after me, but I pushed it." 

She heard her mother mutter and saw her father's grimace at the mention of Ben. Melissa sighed and, shifting her weight onto her toes, slid her hands along her father's legs. She squeezed his thighs and couldn't supress a wry grin when Eammon tensed. 

He thinks I might give his cock a quick rub. He's bricking it with Mum here. 

"But," Melissa insisted, rising to her feet, "I thought we could all manage to start again." The girl paused. "With a few changes," she added. 

Julia gaped at her daughter, again amazed at the girl's maturity and common sense outlook when the Melissa asked, "What do you think, Mum? Would you be willing to come home?" 

"Oh ... I..." Julia's chin wobbled while a single tear slid over her cheek. She nodded quickly, unable to speak, her throat clogged up with a balloon of emotion. 

Melissa pouted with approval and tilted her head. She smiled at her mother and then, turning to her father, she leaned in and kissed his cheek. 

"Fuck her, Dad," Melissa whispered. "Do the brother and sister thing. Give it to her good. Turn her on and make her scream. Give her that big cock ... I'll suck her off you later." 

Rising up from her father's dazed countenance, Melissa announced: "This could be my cue to disappear." She threw the smile at her mother again and waggled her fingers at her gobsmacked father. "I'll leave it up to you two," she giggled.

Julia Morgan, with the cargo pants and wife-beater vest in a forgotten pile on the carpet, lay beneath her husband, thrilled by the way things had turned out. Between her legs Eammon was slurping at her pussy, his tongue doing wonderful things, her clit throbbing. 

"Isn't she a wicked girl?" Julia gasped. 

Misunderstanding Julia's meaning, thinking -- despite all the clues to the contrary -- Eammon interpreted his wife's words to mean that she was aware of the relationship he'd been enjoying with their daughter. 

He felt suddenly chilled and his stomach rolled. 

"What?" 

Julia gave a yelp. 

"Don't stop," she breathed, a hand pushing Eammon's head. "Keep licking me." 

"What do you mean 'wicked'?" Eammon insisted. 

Julia rolled her eyes. 

"For getting us together like this; for making us see the sense of putting all the ... the crap behind us." The woman moaned and purred when a much relieved Eammon lapped at her sex again. "That's it, darling. Lick it good. You always were a great face-fuck." 

The man moved along his wife's body. "Remember what else we used to do?" 

Julia felt a flip of deeper arousal when she saw her husband's expression. He looked so dangerous, so lupine, even licking his lips and staring at her with red-rimmed eyes. Just like she imagined the fabled wolf might look at Red Riding Hood. 

"Remember what?" the woman responded, a tremor in her voice. 

Eammon came back with a voice as dark as that wolf's soul. 

"When we made Melissa. And the times we played at being brother and sister." 

"God ... Eammon..." Lust flared inside Julia. Her pussy melted. "I remember that," she said, her voice curdled with illicit need. "That was so naughty. So dirty. It turned me on so much." 

Eammon leaned in and kissed his wife, but, in the seconds before their lips touched, he whispered, "Taste your cunt on my tongue, Julia. Be my sister again. Kiss your brother and taste me before I stick my dick into your cunt." 

Julia gulped and clawed at her husband's back, her legs coming up to clamp around his waist. He was inside her, filling her with that big cock she'd missed so much without realising it. The words he used and the suggestion of incest had her reeling. It was lovely, glorious to be there, beneath the man she'd loved so passionately once. 

Where had it gone wrong? How had she let it get so bad? 

But, no matter, they were together again. Eammon was inside her and she was clenching and oiling around his girth. She could hear her body squelching, obscene sounds that only served to inflame her further. 

"My brother," she grunted. "Fuck me. I'm your dirty sister. You caught me wanking and showed me how hard you got seeing me." 

Eammon joined in. He didn't know why Melissa had suggested he rekindle the role-play with his wife, but at that moment, with Julia writhing on his cock, her big tits rolling, that tight pussy clamped around him -- he didn't really care. What had Melissa said? To trust her? Well, he had little choice but to do exactly that. And, for once Eammon just let it go, let go of the reins, simply gave it up and allowed the fates to steer. 

"You're my beautiful sister," he groaned. "I couldn't help it. When I saw you naked ... When I saw you wanking..." 

The parallel between what he was saying and what happened with Melissa registered vaguely with the man: "I watched you and my cock got all hard--" 

He bit back on the first syllable of his daughter's name just before it burst out of him. 

Eammon remembered that this wasn't his daughter thrusting her pubis up to meet his urgent, downstroke. 

"--Julia," he grunted, "I pulled my cock and watched you fingering your cunt. It was so sexy I came and came." 

"That's bad," Julia snarled. She bared her teeth as she fucked upwards, desperate for all of Eammon's length. The use of the c-word, in the right setting, always got her hot. And this was the perfect fucking setting as far as she was concerned. 

Eammon, unsure if she meant bad-bad or good-bad, but suspecting the latter, continued his relentless pounding. He'd drill the bitch deep, rip her cunt apart and then pour cum inside her. 

"You're bad," he replied through gritted teeth of his own. Eammon twisted the role-play. "You're a dirty, nasty slut who seduced her father. I'm going to fuck you until you scream." 

"Father?" Julia replied. "That's even nastier than you being my brother." But she didn't miss a beat, just kept on grinding away and mauled her breasts, one after the other, with a single hand. 

Julia could only use one hand on her boobs because the other was wedged between her husband's body and her own. She fingered her clit, rubbing and rubbing at the slippery nub. 

Appalled by his brush with faux-pas, but relieved at Julia's fervent reaction, Eammon maintained the rhythmic pistoning, drilling into his wife's body as though he were trying to spear her to the sofa with his dick. 

"You like that, huh? You want me to be your Daddy?" 

"Oh fuck," Julia bellowed. "I'm there ... I'm ... Fuckingwellthere!" 

The woman climaxed, groaning and grunting, her whole body clenched until, with a huge burst of air she exhaled and juddered her release. 

"You're coming inside me," she panted, feeling the flutter against her cervix, her husband's seed squirting from his cock as it pulsed inside her. "Give me all that creamy spunk!" 

Afterwards, as they lay together, Eammon's cock still inside her body, while both of them cooled down, the man a heavy weight on top of her, Julia saw -- or at least she thought she saw, she wouldn't be certain half-an-hour later -- a shadow move in the deeper dark beyond the living room door. 

In fact, she thought later, analysing the evening's events, hadn't Melissa closed the door on her way out? Julia thought the girl had pulled the door closed -- So how come it was ajar by a good three inches by the time she and Eammon had come together? 

Without knowing it, Julia went through the same process of denial her daughter had experienced when Melissa had discovered the marks in the sandy soil. She chose to believe an alternative, her mind refusing to accept the possibility that someone had been watching. 

Because, in this case, while Julia and Eammon had grunted and snarled through their incestuous role-play, there could only be one person who could have watched their rutting, and overheard, Julia was aghast to realise. If Melissa had seen them she would have been able to hear the obscene dialogue that had passed between them. 

And Julia couldn't countenance that. No way. She couldn't accept that Melissa, their daughter, might have been there to witness that scene. 

6 

Two days later, Sunday, and Julia left the flat she'd used as a refuge. She loaded the few things she'd taken -- work clothes in the main -- into the Mini and hugged Francine, her friend and business partner, goodbye. 

"Thanks," Julia said, holding her friend's upper arms, smiling at her in gratitude. "I don't know what I would have done without you. Thank you for letting me stay these last weeks." 

"It ended well. I'm happy for you," Francine replied. "See you at work tomorrow." 

Julia climbed into the Mini and, waving a hand at Francine who stood on the pavement outside her flat, drove towards her future. 

At the house, with Eammon on duty (6am to 2pm shift), Melissa helped her mother unpack. It didn't take long and by eleven that morning Julia considered herself home. 

"It's a lovely day out there, Mum," Melissa said when mother and daughter were in the kitchen. The girl nodded towards the patio beyond the French doors. "We could sit out there, in the garden. We could do a little sunbathing and have a drink?" 

Julia was in the mood to agree. 

"That sounds divine, darling. Finally, I can relax. It's been a stressful time." She grinned at her daughter. "I'll get changed and we can sit in the garden and laze the day away." 

Twenty minutes later both women were outside. Two sun-chairs reclined beneath the shade of a huge umbrella with the diameter of a parachute. The brolly was redundant at first because Melissa and her mother preferred to bask in the sun. It would get used later, as they sipped tall drinks from sweating glasses, ice tinkling. 

At least that was the idea in Julia's head. 

"This is better than where I sunbathed at the beach," Melissa said, laid face down on a towel with her forehead resting on folded arms. It was the same towel she'd used in the clearing, the one upon which she'd experienced Ben's and her own father's loving. "A little more private," she added. 

Julia shifted position, squirming on her own towel at her daughter's reference to the beach, still uncomfortable by any mention of that holiday. 

"I used to go there with Ben," Melissa continued. She gave a brief, brittle laugh and rolled onto her side, one arm propped beneath her head, her temple resting on one clenched fist. "We found this secluded little spot. It was quiet, just off the track but not easily overlooked. Quite private but still not completely safe if you know what I mean." Melissa heaved a theatrical sigh. "I went there alone when Ben had gone but it wasn't quite the same." 0 

===

Julia clenched her teeth. She could feel the anger bubbling inside her. Why couldn't Mel just shut up? Wasn't all that in the past?" 

"Mel, please, do we have to talk about all that? I'd rather just forget." 

The girl threw back a disingenuous response: "Oh, it doesn't bother me, Mum. I'm completely over it. Honest. But," Melissa added, her tone slipping down to conspiratorial levels. "I can't help wondering ... That is, I..." 

Julia sighed, exasperated and a little embarrassed. She suspected what was coming. 

"Come on, Melissa," she snapped. "Spit it out. What were you wondering?" 

"Well, there was only one other bloke before Ben. And that wasn't so fantastic. So, I just thought, that since you fu--, I mean ... you know ... you went with him, too. Well, was he any good? Did he get you ... you know ... there?" 

Before her mother could protest at the inquiry, Melissa gabbled on. "I don't have much to compare him with," she lied. "He did it for me. He was awesome. And wasn't he gorgeous, Mum? Good-looking and fit?" Melissa rolled her eyes. "And his cock. How big was that!" 

Julia boggled at her daughter. That wasn't what she'd anticipated; Julia had expected Melissa to challenge her about the clearing, to ask if that was where Ben had taken her, but what the girl had said instead had her reeling. Her mouth opened but no words came out. 

Finally, after fifteen excruciating seconds, Julia blustered with, "I don't think it's appropriate to talk to me about that. I-I-I mean," she stammered, "we can talk about ... sex ... in ... uh ... general terms. Of course we can. But it isn't appropriate to discuss what happened with Ben. I find it embarrassing, Melissa, embarrassing in the extreme. I know you're a woman, and you're entitled to a sex life, and if I can ever offer advice on matters of the heart then, darling, I will. But please, please don't ask me about what I did with Ben and how it was between us." 

"You loved it, didn't you, Mum?" 

Julia's eyes widened when she heard the low, husky timbre of her daughter's voice. At first she was annoyed -- hadn't the girl listened to a word? But then, with the tone of Melissa's words resonating deep inside her, the memory of Ben rekindled, reminded about that hard cock and the semen showering over her before they'd made love a second time, Julia felt a pulse between her legs. 

She began to oil and experienced a sudden urge to slide her hand under the elastic waistband of her bikini briefs. 

To herself, Julia admitted that she had loved it. That young man had known how to use his equipment, and had possessed the God-given talent that made him so bloody good. 

"Really, Mel," Julia replied. She heard the rasp in her own voice and blushed, certain that Melissa understood exactly what caused it. "Please. No more talk like that." 

But the girl remained relentless. 

"He had a big one, didn't he, Mum? But not as big as Dad's." 

The word exploded from Julia: "WHAT!" Her mouth hung open before snapping closed and she added, "What did you say?" 

With that shot Melissa rose onto hands and knees. She stood up, eyes hidden behind large sunglasses. 

Offhand, indifferent: "I saw Dad naked a couple of times in the caravan." 

(and I sucked his big dick and fucked him too. I've seen Daddy's cum and felt him squirt it into my tight little pussy) 

"It was no big deal. I walked in on him when he was in the shower, that's all. An accident. He's fit for an old bloke," she causally added, and then ambled into the kitchen through the open patio doors. "Can I get you a drink, Mum?" she called, a rhetorical question, before disappearing inside. 

7 

In the kitchen, Melissa poured an extremely generous measure of gin over ice. She had a feeling her mother could use a strong one. Tonic fizzed and, after mixing herself a (much smaller) vodka and coke, the girl checked the time - - quarter to twelve. She had just over two hours to work on her mother. Maybe longer since Eammon had half-an-hour's drive from the station to home. 

So far Melissa had kept her plan loose, winging it mainly. She had a vague idea of what she wanted, an outline, preferring to use instinct as her guide rather than come up with some detailed scheme. It had come to her after her father's revelation about the incest role-play. 

Since she was embroiled in an affair -- a very, very exciting liaison -- with her father, how sexy would it be if her mother got involved too? 

Wouldn't it be perfect if they could be a family again -- a complete unit, with the three of them loving each other? 

Really loving each other. 

That was Melissa's goal. 

Watching and listening to her parents' make up sex, hearing them gasp out endearments as they pretended to be brother and sister had been so fucking hot. There'd been a scare when her dad had dropped in the father comment, but her mother hadn't paused, hadn't taken offence. In fact, to the contrary, she had gone crazy for it. 

Still, role-play and reality were worlds apart, but Melissa hoped, that by moving slowly along, just edging her mother closer and closer, that she could tip the woman over the edge. 

"Fuck," Melissa moaned, squirming like she needed to pee, her pussy itchy with yearning. 

She hurried outside, eager to keep on grooming her mother towards incest. 

When Melissa walked back across the patio, drinks in hand, her mother was sitting in one of the deck chairs, smoking. 

Before Julia could open her mouth Melissa thrust a glass towards her. 

"Here." 

"Th-thanks," Julia replied. She eyed her daughter, sunglasses pushed into her hair. 

A pause, silence between the pair as Melissa dragged her recliner across the grass. She arranged the chair in the same way she'd lined up her towel in the clearing, checking the angle of her shadow before settling onto the thin mattress. 

Julia sipped gin and spluttered. "Bloody hell, Mel! How strong is this?" 

"Just drink it, Mum. Enjoy the sunshine and have a drink. Relax." Melissa stretched, full of feline grace. "Isn't it lovely being outside in the sun?" 

To Julia it seemed like the girl hesitated, as though Melissa had something to say but was unsure about doing so. 

Then it came: "I used to sunbathe in the nude. Just off the beach. There was that quiet place, the one I told you about. It was where Ben and I did it." 

A longer silence during which Julia didn't dare comment, after all, she knew the place Melissa had spoken of. 

Melissa broke the silence. "Do you mind if I get naked now, Mum? Would it bother you if I went nude?" 

Julia slugged two huge gulps of gin. "Melissa, darling, I don't know if that's quite the done thing." 

"Oh, come on, Mum." The springs of Melissa's sunbed sproinged as she lifted herself off the mattress. "I'm your daughter. We're both girls. What does it matter?" She wedged the glass of vodka into the grass and reached for the knot at her nape. 

Julia couldn't help but compare her daughter's breasts with her own big tits. 

She did the same when the briefs came off and she saw Melissa's smooth vulva. 

"Come on, Mum," Melissa murmured, her tone low and seductive. "I'm nude." She swept her hands along her flanks as though modelling a dress. "And it feels so good. Why don't you try it?" 

Julia blurted an objection when Melissa went to her and grabbed her by the wrist. 

"No, Mel, please..." 

"But you've got a lovely figure, Mum." Melissa pushed her sunglasses onto her forehead. Julia felt the girl's eyes on her breasts. "I'm so jealous of your boobs. I bet Dad goes mad for them." 

Julia yanked her arm free. "Melissa! That's enough," she warned. "What the hell is wrong with you? You tell me you walked in on your father in the shower ... and now you want me to sunbathe nude? Honestly, tell me, what's gotten into you?" 

Melissa laughed and pirouetted away. She settled back onto the sunbed and reached for her drink. 

(Daddy's big cock would you believe?) 

"Must be the sun, Mum. Does things to me." Raising the glass in salute, Melissa added an insouciant, "Cheers," and then closed her eyes, relaxing while the sun warmed on her skin. 

Julia sat there, stunned but oddly disturbed, her libido revving. She found it difficult to relax, her eyes constantly moving towards the lithe girl who lay with such casual lack of inhibition a few feet away. 

It had been a surprise to realise that Melissa kept herself completely depilated down below. And what about the surprisingly thick, meaty labia she'd seen? The girl was really a woman, and quite a curious and adventurous one at that; judging by the things she'd said. 

Julia examined herself with a critical eye. She was in good nick, especially for a woman in her early forties. Ben had enjoyed her voluptuous figure, had raved about her boobs, and Eammon had certainly been impressed on Friday evening. The first time they'd made love -- if that was the right phrase, they'd fucked like rabbits more like -- his ardour had taken her breath away. 

Why not just throw caution to the wind? Melissa was right -- it was just two girls together -- why not see what it felt like to lie there in the nude? Excited by her audacity, Julia stood up and stripped out of the bikini. 

"Wow, Mum," Melissa murmured when the squeak of springs from Julia's sunbed caught her attention. "You've got a lovely bod. And I love that..." 

Melissa's sunglasses went up again and Julia blushed as her daughter pointed at the precise triangle of her pubic bush, newly coiffed and decorative, a tuft that crowned the apex of her slit. 

"...it's so pretty, Mum." Melissa sighed, shaking her head slowly. "I really do wish I had boobs like yours too. They're really lovely." 

Thinking that perhaps it hadn't been such a good idea to get naked, and self- conscious at the girl's frank appraisal, Julia said, "Melissa, darling, is that really the right thing to be saying to your mother?" 

But despite her disparaging vocal response and initial misgivings, Julia enjoyed her daughter's compliments. The girl was right, the sun did feel lovely; it was gorgeous to be nude outdoors. 

Her body's reaction caught her off-guard, too. There was the tingle of delicious sexual arousal between her legs. Melissa's reminder about Ben and how physically gorgeous the young man had been had started it off, but now, with her confidence boosted, self-esteem soaring, euphoric that she was now back in the fold and could enjoy her husband's hard cock, Julia felt she could just lie back in the chair, sip her gin and rub her oily pussy. 

"I mean it, Mum," Melissa responded on a sigh. "You're beautiful." She twisted on the mattress, springs objecting as Melissa bounced onto her side. "Isn't it lovely to be nude like this?" 

Julia took a sip of gin and lit a cigarette. Disturbed by Melissa's level, unblinking stare and the hot, insistent itch between her legs, she needed a slug of booze and the nicotine rush to help her calm down. The atmosphere between mother and daughter seemed different, charged with some indefinable current, almost sexual. 

She sucked smoke deep into her lungs and blew the thin blue-grey stream at the canopy above her. Julia swigged more gin and tonic and then blinked at the empty glass in her hand. 

"Here. Give me that," Melissa said, rising from the sunbed. "I'll get you another." 

"Mel, I really shouldn't. It's a hot day, I've hardly eaten..." 

She was talking to thin air, Melissa had already gone. 

Julia sighed and rested her head against the cushion beneath her. She smoked and enjoyed the beginning of the alcohol buzz. She shivered, nipples tightening, the coins of her saucer-sized areola pimpling when a puff of cool air wafted over her. 

The woman gave a little gasp, doing her utmost to ignore that zephyr, like a lover's breath on her skin. She lay there, breasts aching for Eammon's touch. She imagined his mouth on her nipples, sucking the elongated, sensitive teats between his teeth. 

Julia slipped into a hazy and self-indulgent fantasy where her husband's fingers massaged her tit-flesh, squeezing both breasts before the palm of his hand moved between her legs with a slow glide. 

Julia's clitoris began to pulse, an insistent beat between her legs; her pussy warming. 

She dozed just behind the veil of consciousness, drifting in that place between being fully awake and proper sleep. Her mind wandered, images forming in her head of Eammon and Ben. Both men were there with her -- both nude, each with a huge hard-on. 

"We're both going to fuck you, Julia," the dream Eammon whispered. 

"One in your mouth," Ben muttered, stroking his length. 

Eammon grinned at her, his fist moving slowly over his erection: "And one in your cunt." 

Out loud, cigarette smouldering in the grass after Julia dropped it, the woman moaned. 

"Boys," she mumbled. "Both of you?" 

"And then we're going to stick it to Melissa," Ben said with a wink. "We're going to cover that hot little bitch with cum." 

Julia snapped awake, confused by the dream and the reality of her daughter kneeling by her side. 

"Mum? Are you all right?" 

Julia gave an embarrassed little laugh and sat upright. 

"I'm fine, Mel. I was dozing. Dreaming." Julia took the glass from her daughter and tasted gin. She grimaced. "This is even stronger, Mel!" 

"You said something about boys and both of you ... What were you dreaming about?" 

"Did I? I ... I don't really recall, Melissa. It's ... uh ... it's vague." 

Julia saw the sly smirk on her daughter's face as Melissa asked, "Were you having a dirty dream, Mum? Were you? Were you thinking about two guys?" 

That grin, for some inexplicable reason to Julia, sent a further frisson of sexual arousal through the woman. 

"No, Mel," she objected, eyes downcast. She could feel the heat rising in her face, knew she'd be beetroot red. 

Melissa cawed and winked. 

"You were, Mum. You're scarlet! You were dreaming about two men at the same time. You filthy mare!" 

Then, the girl's amusement evaporated and she regarded her mother, expression serious, her voice dropping. 

"Have you ever done it with two blokes, Mum?" 

The dark, treacly timbre of Melissa's tone, to Julia's internal horror, heightened the arousal she was already experiencing. The pulse in her clitoris cranked up to a throb and her pussy itched -- Hungry for a long, hard and very thick cock. 

"No," she replied, waving a hand at her daughter. "Don't be so bloody ridiculous." 

"But you'd like to?" 

The truth of it was, at that moment, Julia wouldn't mind at all. Two men? Two big lovely dicks? A cock in her mouth while a man licked her cunt? How wicked. So very wanton. 

"Melissa, please ... Why do you insist on talking that way? What is it? What's gotten into you?" 

Your husband, the girl wanted to say. My father's hard-on, that's what's gotten into me. But she didn't say that at all. Melissa had an inkling her mother's libido might, just might be thrumming away, running at high revs. 

This could be the moment, the perfect time to make a move. 

But the girl balked, just short of enough nerve to pounce. 

Still, it had been a good morning. She'd managed to convince her mum to sunbathe nude. Julia had been rattled, Melissa was convinced of that. Melissa had dropped enough sexual innuendo, baldly stated that she appreciated her mother's voluptuous figure, even revealed that shocker about having seen her dad's cock -- Julia had to be reeling from all that. 

The gin would help, especially when her mother had downed the second glass. After that she'd be as squiffy as hell and, Melissa hoped, more manageable. She wanted the woman receptive to suggestion. Melissa wanted to see just how far she could push. 

"It must be the vodka" -- the weakest drink ever poured and which she'd hardly touched -- "and the sun," Melissa replied. The girl rose to her feet but, as she did, also rested one hand on her mother's abdomen, the tip of her pinky finger on that decorative pubic triangle. "You really do have a great figure, Mum," Melissa breathed, the back of her fingers brushing the flank of Julia's breast. "I really love your tits. I'm so jealous." 

Julia didn't say a word. She sat there with every muscle tensed, each sinew tightly strung, and stared at her daughter as the girl hip-swayed towards her sunbed. She gulped gin, taking a hefty swig while Melissa, without a care in the world it seemed, settled onto the lounger. The woman's head buzzed with conflicting emotions. Yearning for sexual fulfilment throbbed between her legs, her pussy almost growling with hunger. Julia craved cock, wanted her husband so much, was desperate for him between her legs, to feel his tongue, fingers and that hard length inside her. 

Without realising it Julia slipped back beneath the surface of consciousness again. She dreamed once more -- lewd imaginings where she did unspeakable things with Ben and Eammon. 

When she surfaced, snapping back to reality with a jerk that caused a disconcerting spong to sound in the springs beneath her, Julia threw a look towards Melissa, expecting to find her daughter on the lounger. 

But Melissa was nowhere to be seen. The bed was empty. 

8 

Eammon Morgan was a very worried man. He'd lost his head and, as a direct result, had also lost control. His entire life had been compromised because of what he had allowed to happen with Melissa. From the start he should have exercised more self-control. Right at the beginning, on the holiday, he should have nipped it in the bud. But he hadn't, he had just blundered on, led by his cock. He could have had some overtime at the station but had been too preoccupied by the situation at home to concentrate on work. Melissa and Julia were alone, which meant the girl could be spilling everything to her mother. 

Eammon left the station just after two in the afternoon. He drove home, convinced that, despite her apparent maturity, Melissa -- perhaps overcome by a moment of guilt -- would have confessed all to Julia. He fully expected to meet his wife spitting venom, full of acrimony at the sin he'd committed. 

By the time he arrived at home and parked the car in the double garage his stomach was cartwheeling. 

Peru was a burgeoning notion in his head when he pressed the zapper and the garage door hummed closed. Where was his passport? 

"This is what happens when I'm not in charge," Eammon muttered to himself a moment before he slid his key into the front door. 

The house was silent. An accusation? Had they both gone? 

Fear stabbed Eammon beneath the ribs. Could Julia have called the station and dropped him right in the proverbial? 

No -- Eammon shook his head. Silly idea, he reasoned. That would damage Melissa as well. Julia wouldn't do that. She would protect her daughter. 

The worry gnawed at him while myriad scenarios, all disturbing, ran through his troubled mind. 

But what if Julia was so overcome with anger that she was blinded by it? She had a temper on her. Okay, the fuse might burn slowly, but when she blew Julia's anger caused fireworks. The news that Eammon had fucked their daughter -- regardless that the girl had done a lot of the chasing -- might bring on a tantrum of Olympic proportions. Julia might go nuclear and blow up everything, laying waste to their lives ... and his career. 

"Shit, shit, shit..." Eammon mumbled. No sign of life in the house. Nobody in the living room. His study on the lower floor was empty. There were, however, signs of recent activity in the kitchen: two bottles, one gin, one vodka standing on the counter; small pools of water, wet patches that indicated ice had melted; a single glass, used, sitting in the sink. 

The patio doors were open, and when Eammon walked across the room he saw, to his huge relief, Julia stretched out on a sunbed. He did a double-take. Was she naked out there? 1 

===

Eammon took a step outside for a closer examination and boggled at the sight of his wife beneath the vast canopy of the umbrella. Julia was most definitely nude, and apparently asleep. 

He realised in an instant -- it didn't take a detective's powers of deduction to figure out this little scene -- whose influence was at work here. This was Melissa again. The girl had somehow influenced her slightly uptight mother to go nude in the garden. 

But where was his daughter? Eammon needed to talk to her. He had to find out what the girl was playing at. Her manipulation of the situation -- inviting Julia to the house and subsequent stage management of her parents' reconciliation -- had staggered Eammon. Not that he'd objected at the time, Julia looked great and the sex had been intense and very dirty, but there were questions on his mind. 

He and Julia had shared the marital bed on Friday night. Saturday had been spent together as a family and there had been no opportunity to speak to Melissa about the situation. That day had been agony to the man. He'd burned to ask his daughter what the hell she was doing but he never got the chance. He felt the situation slide out of his influence. It seemed that Julia assumed reconciliation was on the cards, and Melissa compounded that assumption by her continual prattle about how great it was to have them all together again. 

In the end, the strings holding his emotions already frayed, Eammon succumbed. Once again he let loose of the reins and allowed fate to chart his course. It went against his character to let things decide themselves, but all manner of confusion and anxieties wore him down, and in the end he thought it best to go with it. 

In actual fact, he reasoned, it might be best to have Julia close. That way he could keep an eye on her -- and Melissa -- and therefore be best positioned to act if it looked like the wheels were going to fall off the wagon. 

But where did that leave him and Melissa? Was their affair over? And, if so, could Mel keep such a huge and potentially disastrous secret? In his work, Eammon had seen how keeping something like this a secret could weigh down on people. The guilt could be corrosive, eating away until, one day, maybe a week, maybe ten years, even twenty, a person could snap and reveal all. 

The prospect of hot-footing it to Peru, probably breaking an enjoyable retirement by then, didn't fill Eammon with joy. 

No, he needed to find Melissa and get things straight. He had to regain control of the situation. 

He didn't have far to look. 

Eammon spun round at the sound of, "Hi, Daddy," behind him. 

"Mel." He flicked a glance over his shoulder. Julia slept on. Eammon then noticed his daughter was also naked. He ogled the girl's body, a sight he would never tire of. God, she was so fucking sweet. "We have to talk, baby." Another furtive look over his shoulder. "I'm going mental with all this." 

"What is there to talk about, Dad? Mum's home..." 

Melissa paused and smirked. It was the same grin that her mother couldn't interpret, the sly one that Eammon understood only too well. 

The man's cock reacted, an appendage with a will of its own. Immune to the fear and anxiety souring in Eammon's guts, that length of erectile tissue swelled and stiffened in the face of that knowing grin, that leer of corruption, an expression that told Eammon everything -- His daughter's libidinous intent. 

"...I saw you fucking her," the girl continued. "I heard what you said to each other. Oh, Daddy," Melissa breathed, rolling her eyes, "it was so fucking sexy listening to you two. I came so hard." 

Melissa squeezed her breasts and squirmed. Her eyes blazed as she gazed at her father. 

Eammon, his danger radar pinging away, checked over his shoulder for a third time. 

"Melissa, shush." He waved his hands in front of his body, fingers spread, flapping a warning at the girl to keep her voice down. To just shut up. "Your mother's right there," Eammon hissed. 

"I know, Dad. We've been out in the garden for a couple of hours." Melissa raised herself on tiptoes and peered over her father's shoulder. "But I think the gin might have made her sleepy." She dropped back onto the soles of her feet and looked her father in the eye. "So, you want to talk?" The girl turned. "Come on then, Dad." She began to walk away. "So let's talk." 

Eammon hurried after his daughter, bending at the waist slightly in deference to the iron-hard length in his trousers. 

The roll of Melissa's hips kept Eammon's eyes glued to his daughter's rump. He was torn between his desperate need to clear the air and desire for that ripe body. He could have groaned with frustration, wondering again how he had come to find himself embroiled in such a mess. He knew that there was just no way that, as long as Melissa was also willing, that he would be able to resist his daughter's charms. 

"Are you hard for me, Daddy?" asked Melissa as she led her father upstairs. 

Eammon gulped and croaked, "Yes, Mel. I'm ... I'm stiff. You're so lovely, I can't help myself." 

"Would you like me to take care of you?" The girl paused on the landing and gestured with one hand closed in a fist. "Or I could suck you?" she offered. 

Eammon swallowed heavily again, wiping the back of a hand across a brow beaded with perspiration. 

He struggled internally, somehow resisting the urge to rip his suit off and devour the blue-eyed temptress standing so unashamedly naked in front of him. 

"Mel ... What's going to happen?" he asked. Eammon nodded towards the rear of the house. "Your mum's back. We have to stop this. If she ever found out, Melissa ... Oh God, I daren't think about it. Do you realise how big this is - - what we've done? If it ever got out I'd be in so much shit." He pointed a finger at his daughter. "And you, Mel, if anyone found out we'd been..." Eammon fished for words, poised on the verge of saying "fucking" but curiously prissy -- maybe it was the suit, the reminder of his job, the rank and status -- he was reluctant to swear in front of his daughter. "If anyone found out what we've done, you'd be damaged too, darling." 

With a staggering lack of concern, at least that's how it seemed to Eammon, Melissa answered with, "We'll be careful, then. We'll just have to take care not to get caught." The girl took a step towards her father. "I don't want to stop, Dad," she breathed. 

Another step closer and Eammon could almost feel the heat coming off her. His cock throbbed. Pre-cum oozed into his underwear. 

"You can fuck me and still do Mum. I'm not jealous, Dad, if that's what you're worried about. In fact it turns me on to think about you and her together." 

Melissa took her father's hand, a useless appendage paralysed by a tempest of conflicting emotions and impressions inside the man at that moment. 

"Touch me, Daddy," whispered Melissa in that breathy wide-eyed way she used on her father. "Feel my boobs and my pussy. I'm so fucking wet, Dad. My pussy is so, so wet. I've been naked with Mum all morning. She's got a great figure..." Melissa ran her tongue over Eammon's lips. "I'm so envious of her big tits, Daddy." 

Eammon blinked and looked down to where the girl's hand caressed the bulge in his trousers. 

Melissa flicked down the zip. 

"I wanted to suck Mum's breasts." 

Eammon groaned, his head lolling when Melissa's fist caressed him. 

"I want to suck Mum's pussy, Daddy. I want to lick her clit and finger her cunt." 

Eammon broke at that. He gasped and, his fingers leaving the girl's breasts, lifted her bodily with both hands, cradling her in his arms before stampeding into her bedroom. Melissa yelped and laughed when her father dumped her on the bed, the laugh turning to a moan when he then forced her legs apart and slurped at her sex. 

"You can have us both, Dad," Eammon heard as, mindless to the enormous risk - - Julia was downstairs -- just before he moved along Melissa's body and, still dressed, even wearing his shoes, with his cock jutting from his flies, he slid into that warmth. 

The man groaned when he slid balls deep inside his daughter, cock knifing through her molten desire. 

9 

When she woke up and found herself alone outside, Julia sat up, her head woolly, groggy from the after effects of gin in the early afternoon. 

"Mel?" she called, looking around the garden in case her daughter had moved in search of a better position in which to sunbathe. Julia flung her legs over the side of the lounger. She cursed when she inadvertently kicked the half-full glass and gin seeped into the grass. 

Julia stood up and cast an eye around the garden a second time. There was no sign of Melissa. The girl had gone, taking her vodka with her I appeared. 

"Melissa!" called Julia as she walked into the kitchen. The time surprised her -- had she slept for so long? It felt like she'd merely dozed, twenty minutes at most, but the digits on the clock in the microwave oven told a different story. 

Her husband should be home. But where was he? 

"Eammon!" A pause. "Melissa! ... Mel, are you here?" 

She took a glass from the cupboard and filled it with water from the tap. Julia swallowed quickly and then refilled the glass and drank again. Refreshed, her thirst abated, Julia climbed the stairs and, just when her foot cleared the top step, her daughter appeared from the bathroom on the landing. 

"Sorry, Mum," the girl said. "I was about to jump into the shower. I heard you calling ... Are you all right?" 

"Yes, yes. I'm fine," Julia replied, self-conscious and awkward by her nudity when Melissa was covered in a towel. "I just woke up and wondered where you were. Is your father home?" 

"I think he's in your bedroom. He's not been home for long." 

Julia gave a weak smile and thanked her daughter. She walked past Melissa towards the bedroom she would once again share with her husband. 

She found Eammon stripping out of his suit. 

"You're home," Julia said, stating the obvious. An urgent call from her bladder caused Julia to miss her husband's expression completely. She didn't notice how flustered he was as she moved past him on her way to the en-suite. 

Rattled by the close call, Eammon had pumped jizm into his daughter only a minute or two earlier, the man struggled to recover his composure. He had seconds at best to regain his cool. 

"I saw you in the garden," Eammon said. His best option, he knew, was to get his wife on the back foot. To ask her questions and keep her distracted. "Nude," he added. "That isn't like you, Jules." 

Eammon heard the rattle of the toilet roll holder and imagined his wife wiping herself after peeing a long stream into the bowl. The toilet flushed. 

"It was Melissa," Julia replied, her voice coming from the en-suite over the splash of water running as she washed her hands. "I don't know what that girl's thinking of these days," Julia added, returning to the bedroom. 

Eammon hastily folded his cum-smeared suit trousers onto a hanger and stashed the offending article in his wardrobe. He could sort that out later. 

"She's been acting really weird," his wife was saying. 

"How so?" Eammon asked, buying time. He knew the answer to that question well enough. Or at least the gist of it. Melissa was off her head with her sexual desires. 

"Sort of ... dirty," Julia replied after a moment's consideration. "Sexy-dirty, I mean. She was saying things, really intimate stuff. Really sexual." 

The blade of fear pricked Eammon again. He did his best to play it cool, but it was so bloody difficult. His heart hammered in his chest while the man fought to remain calm. He'd let Julia tell it. There was no point in interrupting her. Pre-empting her could be disastrous. Eammon knew from experience during interviews that people sometimes gave out way too much information. They rattled on, often offering unasked for information before they could see the big picture. 

He kept silent and Julia filled him in. 

"She just stripped off in front of me. She cajoled me into it, too." Julia blew out a breath, her cheeks ballooning. "I don't know quite how she did it but there I was, in the buff. Then she just kept on commenting about my breasts and how she loved them ... about how she envied me." Julia blushed. "Do you know, Eammon," she continued, quietly, "she even remarked about how you must love them." 

The woman paused, deliberating over her next revelation. 

"Our daughter told me you had a big cock," added Julia eventually. "Said she'd seen you naked at the caravan." Her voice rose to a higher pitch; incredulous. "She even touched me. Oh, she made it appear like it was an accident, but she put her hand on my tummy and..." Julia laid a hand where her daughter's had rested, low down on her belly, "...her finger was on my pubes. She stroked my breast, Eammon. She caressed the side of it with the back of her fingers. Just brushed me tight there on my boob." 

Flustered yet relieved that the girl hadn't let slip anything about the incest, Eammon shook his head, his face set, as though puzzled by his daughter's behaviour. 

"I ... I don't know what to say, Julia." Eammon spread his hands. 

His wife moved towards him. 

"She's right, though," Julia murmured. "You have got a big dick." 

Eammon, only too aware he must reek of sex, knowing his cock was coated with the residue of Melissa's lust and his own outpouring, stepped back. 

"I did get a little horny." Which was the understatement of the year but Julia could hardly admit to what had really passed through her mind. "The gin I had and the sun really got to me. I had a dream, a really filthy one, Eammon." 

The man gulped as his wife moved closer. His bare rump hit the edge of the wardrobe door. 

"It's made me all gooey, honey," Julia continued. She regarded her husband, eyebrows arched, eyes sparkling. A smile twitched at the corners of her mouth, and if Julia could have seen that expression she'd recognise it as the same devious smirk Melissa sometimes wore. "Come on, Eammon," Julia insisted. She pressed her sun-oiled, perspiration-sheened body against Eammon. "How about a little fuck? Mel's in the shower. We can keep it quiet and make it quick. Just fuck me, darling. Do it to me hard and fast." 

Eammon's cock twitched with renewed interest. The man himself couldn't quite believe it. He was in his forties for fuck's sake. What business did his dick have reviving so soon? Nevertheless, as surprised as he was at the quick reload, again reckless with that urgent surge of lust, forgetting that he had just dipped his wick in his daughter, Eammon pulled his wife to him and kissed her mouth. 

They went at each other in a frenzy of gasps and whispered endearments. Eammon bundled his wife to the bed, dancing with her across the room while their lips remained locked together. He pushed Julia onto the mattress, a low growl coming from his chest, a deep rumble of yearning before he thrust her thighs wide and licked her from anus to clit. 

Julia gasped and snorted and clawed at the quilt beneath her. 

"God, darling, that feels so fucking good," groaned the woman. "I'm already hot and wet down there. Can you taste me?" she squealed. "Do I taste good?" 

"See for yourself." Eammon rose and moved in to kiss his wife. 

"Daddy," Julia moaned, returning to their role-play from Friday. 

Brother and sister was one thing, but Daddy and Daughter? Oh fuck, that was so much hotter. 

Eammon was poised above her, his length in one hand, the blunt cock-head nudging her. 

"Are you going to fuck your little girl with that thing?" Julia whispered. 

And when her husband said nothing, when he merely gazed at her, his mouth open, eyes glazed, Julia groaned and thrust her hips up to take him inside. 

"You are, Daddy," she grunted, already moving, rushing to her climax. "You are fucking me. Do it. Fuck my pussy. Fuck it like a good Daddy should." 

"Julia," Eammon grunted, the bells of deja-vu clanging. 

His wife and daughter were spookily alike. He hadn't noticed before but both women looked up at him with the same expression of surprise, their faces twisted with desire, lust burning in their eyes. They moved the same way and even used similar phrases. 

"Fuck, Julia," Eammon groaned, "that's so filthy." He winced and moaned, eyes rolling before he recovered and continued to thrust into the woman beneath him. "Am I your daddy, darling? Do you like Daddy fucking you?" 

"Yes!" Julia squealed. "I do, I fucking adore it. Fuck your girl's pussy, Daddy. Make me come. I'm so hot and wet for your cock." 

What happened next, Julia found when she was in the middle of her analysis, later, much later, was one of those moments when life can turn in an instant. When, in that period of reflection that would follow, Julia thought about why she acted as she did that Sunday afternoon, she could only ascribe it to simple, good old, human nature. After all, people did crazy things all the time, especially when caught in the throes of sexual abandon. Lust was a powerful force that had the capacity to render even presidents of influential countries to behave with reckless abandon in the very halls in which they wielded that power. And don't people start ill-advised affairs all the time? Bosses and employees, neighbours, married women and young men? 

It was when the surge of her climax had just begun that it happened. The pivotal moment arrived just as the warmth rippled from that place between her legs, suffusing outwards in waves. Right at the point Julia's insides clenched and she felt the surge down there, the rush of viscous wetness accompanied by her body squelching around her husband's girth, she opened her eyes and saw, with an immense slap of shock, Melissa standing in the doorway, fingers wedged between her thighs. 

"Come for Daddy," she heard the girl say. "Go on, fuck my Daddy's cock. Come for him." 

Julia stared into her daughter's eyes, saw the girl's face twisted with lust, her eyelids heavy while a hand stirring around her vulva. 

"Oh God!" she cried. "Mel! Shit, Melissa..." 

Julia's orgasm hit, the tide taking her out to a place beyond her senses. Her husband was fucking into her, grunting his pleasure, and her daughter was looking on. She was vaguely aware of Melissa sawing away at her own clit. Julia could see the girl was close to orgasm as her own climax boiled on and on. 

Julia heard Melissa's voice as though it came across a vast distance. 

"You're coming, Mum. Fuck, look at you cumming on Daddy's cock." 

She heard Eammon's blurt: "Melissa ... Bloody hell, girl, what--?" 

"Don't stop, Eammon," Julia mumbled, barely aware of what she was saying. 

It didn't matter. None of it. The sole focus for her at that moment was the pleasure she was experiencing. They could deal with it all later. All of the crap could be discussed. All she cared about was her orgasm. 

"Don't stop, Eammon," Julia mumbled again. "Please, don't fucking stop." Her eyes locked on her daughter's and Julia, through the mist of her joy, saw the girl's eyes clear. 

Melissa looked at her mother, completely lucid. 

"Is it that good, Mum?" 

"Yes," Julia gasped. "Yes it is. So fucking good." 

The girl, as though bidden by some signal given by her mother, crossed the room. 

She placed a hand on her father's back and Eammon gawped at her, totally gobsmacked at what was occurring. 

"Keep fucking her, Dad," Melissa, her eyes focussed on her mother. "She wants you to keep going." 

Melissa reached out a hand and stroked Julia's breasts. 

"Can I fuck Daddy, too, Mum?" she continued. "Later. Can I fuck Daddy ... And can I kiss you, now?" 

Julia didn't object when Melissa's lips touched hers. To the contrary, she opened her mouth and sucked on the girl's tongue, the climax blooming again. 

Epilogue 

One year later: The South of France 

Eammon Morgan opened the boot of the rented car and hauled out his luggage. It had been two weeks since he'd seen his wife and daughter, they having gone on ahead while Eammon had to work. 2 

===

This year he'd splurged and gone for the villa rather than a caravan on the beach; they could afford it, and this place would be so much more private. 

They needed privacy. 

When Eammon's feet crunched over the gravel, with the high gate gliding shut behind him, a woman appeared at the front door. 

"Hello, Dad," Melissa said, smiling. "Good flight?" 

"The best Ryanair could offer. Do you know how much they want for a beer on those flights? What a rip-off!" 

Melissa chortled, stepping back to allow her father to enter the cool interior. 

"This place is lovely, Dad." The girl's tone lowered to conspiratorial a level. "Completely private. Just like they said in their ad. Nobody overlooks us at all." 

"Which is handy," Eammon replied, nodding at his daughter's nakedness. "Where's my bedroom?" 

Melissa laughed at the nod. 

"I've got that room." Melissa pointed to a door after Eammon had followed his daughter's rump up a curving staircase. "Mum's is this one." She pointed to another door further along the wide, tile-floored corridor. "And you're in here." 

Eammon walked into a large room made bright and airy by virtue of walls painted a startling white and open double doors leading out to a wide balcony. Gauzy curtains billowed when a breeze wafted in through the open doors. Eammon sighed, the stresses of work and an early flight melting away. 

He placed his bags onto the floor, again tiled like the rest of the villa. 

"Each bedroom has a big bed, Dad," Melissa said, pointedly. She took a step towards her father, hands going to the buttons on his travel-creased shirt. "Good idea for sleeping arrangements, eh?" The shirt slid over Eammon's shoulders. "We can just laze around by the pool and read; we can sunbathe; we can drink red wine and get nicely squiffy." Eammon's belt buckle chinked; Melissa unzipped him. "You can sleep with me if you want, you can sleep with Mum if you want..." 

Eammon found himself feeling slightly ridiculous, standing there with his jeans and underwear pooled around his shins; a feeling that was short-lived when Melissa pressed her body to his. 

"...And Mum and I can sleep together if the mood takes us." The girl's fist cranked her father's erection. "Perfect, eh? No jealousies because you're sharing with Mum all the time." Melissa giggled, adding, "And the place is so secluded, Dad, that we can fuck outdoors, too. I think I'd like that." 

Melissa stood on tip-toe and kissed her father's mouth. She heard his moan and worked her hand faster to coax more sighs and gasps from the man. 

"Couldn't you at least let your father unpack and shower before you jumped on him, Mel?" Julia, naked and tanned, walked into the room. "You're such a cock- hungry little madam." She reached the couple and kissed Eammon on the lips. "Hello, darling, I'm so glad you're here at last. We've missed you." 

Julia glanced at her husband's stiffness in Melissa's fist. She faced her daughter, smiling as she said, "How about we leave your father alone so he can at least shower? A few more minutes won't hurt." 

Melissa nodded. "Okay," she replied with a nod and released the angry length of male gristle. 

"We'll be down by the pool, Eammon," said Julia as she squeezed Eammon's hard- on. "Both of us, both of your girls." Man and wife kissed with passion, desire flaring between Julia's legs while Melissa looked on. 

The kiss broke, leaving Eammon yearning for more. 

"Both of you," the man whispered. "Both of my beautiful girls." 

Julia stepped to her daughter's side and encircled the girl's waist with one arm. 

"You better hurry, Eammon," the mature woman murmured with a smirk. Her head swivelled towards Melissa, and the girl, knowing exactly what to do, opened her mouth for her mother's tongue. 

"You teasing pair of bitches," Eammon rumbled, almost tripping over the clothing bunched around his calves when he lurched towards the pair. 

Julia laughed and Melissa grinned at the comedy value Eammon provided. 

"You love it when we tease," Julia responded. "If you don't get in that shower," she added, "you'll be too late. We'll be enjoying each other too much to bother with you." 

"See you by the pool, Daddy," Melissa taunted before both women walked out of the room. 

Eammon stood there for several seconds, the after image of his wife and daughter, their hip-swaying gait and tanned buttocks imprinted on his brain. 

"Fucking hell," he sighed on a long exhale. And then, galvanised by the promise of the delight of both women together, eager to join them, he kicked off his shoes and scrambled out of his remaining clothes. 

There was no need for clothes -- that was part of the arrangement, the family would go nude while inside the compound. 

Eammon showered; a mere spray, soap and rinse before he raced downstairs in search of the pool. 

When he arrived, panting slightly from exertion and keen anticipation, his cock fully tumescent, Eammon found his wife laid on a sunbed, her legs wide while Melissa lapped and slurped at her mother's opening. 

Julia's face, shaded by the broad-brimmed incongruity of a large yet elegant straw hat, turned towards Eammon when he appeared. 

"Oh goody," the woman said, her voice thick with lust. "A big cock. Look, Melissa," she added. "Daddy's here ... And he's brought a gift." 

"Oh Jesus," Eammon breathed. He boggled at the two women, his girls, momentarily stunned. 

His wife was so ripe and delicious, her face slack with pleasure while his daughter -- lithe and firm -- threw a quick grin at him and then lapped at Julia's sex again. 

Eammon, unable to resist, stroked his erection. 

Julia beckoned with a lazy wave of one arm, a languid gesture that suggested they had all the time in the world. 

"Don't wank it, darling," the woman crooned. "Come here. Let me suck you while our darling daughter licks my pussy." Julia's back arched and she sighed. "Oh, Mel, darling ... That's nice. You're making your Mummy feel very good. Keep licking, me, sweetheart. That's it, suck my clitty..." 

"Suck it, Mum," Melissa said during a brief pause in her oral attentions upon her own mother. "Suck Daddy's big one. But leave some for me." She stared at her father's cock distorting her mother's face, the girth stretching Julia's lips. "Oh fuck," the girl moaned, "I'm so glad Daddy's finally here." 

Silence except for moans and gasps and the liquid slurp and juicy smacking of Julia's lips and tongue sucking and slobbering over her husband's dick. 

"I don't think I can keep this up for long," Eammon rasped through gritted teeth a few minutes later. "It's been two weeks and I can't help it." 

"Let me have a go before he spunks all over the place, Mum," squealed Melissa. "Don't be such a greedy cow." 

Julia's head jerked back and her husband's cock sproinged from her mouth. She wiped the back of a hand across her smeared lips and said, "I want first fuck when he recovers. Is that a deal, Mel?" 

The girl looked doubtful for a moment before responding: "I get to sleep with him tonight. That way I can have it first thing in the morning." Melissa moved to a neighbouring lounger and settled into it. She opened her legs and pointed to her sex. "Lick me, Mum. Get me there while I suck Dad off. Then we've got a deal. You fuck him first." 

Eammon found himself fucking his daughter's face while the girl herself grunted and gasped around his girth. 

Julia pulled the sunhat from her head by the brim and sent it spinning, a straw Frisbee across the tiles before, proficient after a year's practice, licked and fingered her daughter closer and closer to orgasm. Silence again save, as earlier, the moans and grunts and occasional swear word as the family enjoyed each other. 

"I'm going to come," Melissa whined, her nose wrinkling as she winced with pleasure. She cranked at her father's cock, her fist moving quickly, the pre- cum that had leaked from the man squelching under her fingers. "Finger it, Mum. Right there. Yes, you know just where to get me." 

"Oh, shit," Eammon blurted. "I--" 

The hot stuff flicked out of him and spattered indiscriminately, gouts of jizm spurting from the single eye in his cock-head that rained down on Melissa, the sunbed and the tiles. 

Julia reached for her husband's cock with one hand while she finger-fucked her daughter to a noisy climax. Melissa was too far gone with pleasure, writhing and squirming, gasping her delight, to continue masturbating her father through his orgasm, so Eammon's wife took him between her lips, sucking that domed head as it spurted twice more, the jizm gushing into her mouth. 

Julia then moved to her daughter and kissed the girl, forcing cum into Melissa's mouth. The women kissed, Eammon gasping and staring at them while their tongues swirled and they shared his ejaculate. 

"Get on your hands and knees, Julia," Eammon growled. "I'm going to stay hard after seeing you two doing that. That's so fucking filthy." 

"Fuck me, darling," Julia breathed as she settled into position. The woman's hips rocked side-to-side in invitation. "I'm so wet, Eammon. Just put that thing inside me and really do it." 

Eammon moved behind his wife and grabbed her hips. He held his cock in one hand and thrust at her. 

Melissa went to her mother's head and kissed the woman again. 

"Mum," the girl muttered, eyes bright as she stared into the woman's face. "What a holiday. The three of us ... Oh, Mum, we can be naked and free. We can all love each other." Melissa paused, suddenly overcome with emotion, her chest filled with love for her parents. 

How different it was to a year ago. She had changed so much, just like her mum and dad; they were altered too. Eammon was no longer an anal retentive control freak and Julia had blossomed once she embraced the new relationship between Eammon, their daughter, and herself. 

"Yes, baby," Julia mumbled. Her eyes widened when she felt her husband's girth stretching her. "We can enjoy this holiday. The three of us," the woman added on a long groan. 

Melissa licked a dribble of semen from her mother's chin. She looked along her mother's back and saw the woman's buttocks rippling while Eammon fucked into her. 

"I love you, Daddy," the girl breathed. "I love Mum and I love being nude with both of you. 

She rose and walked to her father, squatting beside him to watch her parents fuck. 

"I love you, too, baby," Eammon grunted, and then set about giving his wife the pleasure she wanted. 

His daughter would get hers later. Report_Story
