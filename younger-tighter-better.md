 ************** 

 Diana Prentiss felt a thrill go through her as she and her husband entered the porn store. 

 Diana prided herself on the fact that she was no prude. She knew what she was doing in the bedroom, and she was happy to experiment. She was not ashamed of her sexual drive and she was open about the fact that she loved to masturbate, and watch porno, and use toys on herself. Diana was clearly a very open, honest and genuine person, a free spirit. 

 She couldn't quite be fit into a single category. Looking at her slim frame, her long, slightly curly brown hair, and her manner of dress, some might see her as more of a hippie chick. Sometimes, she would wear long, flowing dresses, or thin, almost retro blouses. Some days she would be wearing corduroy pants and some t-shirts with a band's name and logo on them. Some days, she would wear thin, flattering jeans and a simple, pretty top. You never knew what you got with her, and because of that, you would write her off as a hippie or a hipster. You would think she was the type that was a non-conformist, someone who doesn't abide by the barriers of what 'the man' tells her to do. You might imagine her stubbornly choosing a way of life simply to not go along with the masses. 

 But she wasn't so simple. She was a fiercely-intelligent, college-educated woman. She had a Masters in education, and she taught first-graders for a living. Despite her appearance, she was a total professional. She was good at her job and didn't let her free-spirit ways stand in the way of living a relatively normal life and working a good job. She was a free-spirit, she wasn't naïve. 

 Diana was also very pretty. There was a certain relatability to her beauty. She wasn't a model, but there was something about her that was eye-catching. The more you knew her, the more attractive she became. Through her positive spirit, her elegance, un-showy prettiness, her fit body, it didn't take long to find her appealing. She wasn't the type to beat you over the head with her looks, but she was no slouch. She was fit, she a cute butt and her boobs, although on the smaller side, really fit the total package and suited her. A giant, bulbous rack wouldn't fit her trim frame. Her B cups did just fine. Her husband would certainly agree. 

 Evan Prentiss was seemingly an odd match for Diana. While she was more the free-spirit, he seemed more like a straight arrow. While his wife dressed in airy, comfortable clothing, he would be in dress clothes for work at his office job. They were a practice in contrasts. And somehow, they just clicked. Diana saw something in him from the start. They met at a party in college. Diana sensed there that although he seemed so well put-together, there was an animal inside, waiting to be unleashed. He was very nice and the perfect gentleman, a boy next door, but Diana sensed he had potential in the bedroom. 

 She was right. 

 Diana pressed the normally shy Evan, pulling him out of his shell. He was extremely cute, his face very boyish, and his hair just unkempt enough to show he had a slight bit of a fun side. It took some prodding on her part, some hard work over the course of a few dates, but Diana unleashed the man inside of him. 

 Evan was typically so kind, respectful, and soft-spoken. But Diana had brought out his nasty side. She had seen his boyish face tightened with lust. She had seen his firm muscles flexing and writhing. She had heard his kind voice transformed into one of a demanding, lusty man. Out of the bedroom, he was still the kind, gentle Evan. But in the bedroom, as time went on, Diana brought him out of his shell more and more. 

 That's what led them to "Lace and Leather Adult Superstore." 

 It was the natural progression. Diana had been Evan's first real major girlfriend, and like the good young man he was, he put a ring on her finger. They had been married for a few years now. Both were 29, and things were great. They lived a comfortable life, and they were still very much in love. Their sex life was still going strong, as Diana made sure to keep evolving their bedroom antics, trying new things at every opportunity to prevent things from stagnating. Both of them enjoyed the action, and Diana was always happy to keep things fresh and interesting. Evan was very good in bed and as time went on he only got better. Diana knew that if she kept pushing, she could make him the real lustful, sexual animal she saw inside of him. That was the Evan she craved having. 

 Porn was the ticket to get there. 

 Diana had been excited to discover the porno shop in town. Despite her free- spirited nature, she had never actually been to an adult store. So as soon as she got the opportunity, she dragged the slightly anxious Evan to "Leather and Lace." 

 He was so cute when he was nervous, Diana thought. Despite their bedroom antics, outside of the bedroom, in the real world, he was still very much restrained and guarded. So, while for a girl like her, going to a porno shop was an exciting proposition, it was the last place a guy like Evan wanted to be caught in. But he was a good husband and complied, going along with his wife in her plan. Diana giggled at his nervousness. 

 She loved to make him squirm. 

 As they entered the store, both of them reacted. Diana looked around with wide eyes, while Evan blushed. Diana smiled as she saw the racks of DVDs, the sex toys hanging from the walls, and the sexy outfits hanging on the displays. It was a big store and there was a lot of content to take in. And that wasn't counting the girl behind the counter, the only other occupant in the store. 

 Diana took a look at this girl. And she was a girl, maybe 19 or so, surprisingly young to work at a shop like this. But taking a look at her made you realize she was the type of girl who would work at a porno store. She was a redhead, her hair chopped short, laying in layers on her head, barely grazing her shoulders. Her skin was pale and creamy, like porcelain. This girl was eyeing the happy couple, her eyes strikingly green as she flicked through a magazine, some violet eye shadow complimenting her look. She had a lip ring through her plump, lower lip, and each of her ears had multiple piercings. Diana guessed she had a few other piercings that couldn't be seen. The girl was wearing a tight, thin off-white cotton blouse with a colored, patterned design repeating all over it, clinging to her body and highlighting her absolutely enormous rack. 

 Diana was surprised to see a girl that young with breasts that big. They were just huge. Diana had never seen boobs this big. She contemplated if they were fake, but judging by their perkiness and full, round shape, she surmised those massive jugs were indeed very real. All natural. They were ripe, juicy melons. And judging by the thinness of her top, and the slight indentations from her nipples, this young woman was bra-less. Diana couldn't help but feel a bit inadequate, this woman ten years her junior had breasts maybe four times bigger than hers. 

 Down below, the girl had a leather skirt down to just above her knees, clinging to her thighs and full, round ass. She also wore thick, chunky black combat boots, making it clear she was one of those emo type girls. A girl like Diana was not afraid to accept the beauty of another woman, and despite some of her more extreme clothing choices, it was clear this young woman was very attractive. She wasn't crazy fit or anything like that, the girl definitely had curves, but the look worked for her. 

 The girl looked at the happy couple lazily as they entered the store. She glanced at them for a few moments before returning her attention to her magazine, not feeling the urge to help the new customers in her store. 

 "Jeez." Evan said, nervously, head slightly hunched, as if not wanting to be caught. 

 "Evan, you're not gonna get in trouble. This is a big city. No one you know is gonna catch ya." Diana said. 

 "I know, it's just... it's just weird to be here." Evan said. 

 "C'mon hon, don't be nervous. Loosen up." Diana said, reassuring her husband, rubbing his shoulders. 

 "If my folks could see me now." Evan said quietly to himself. 

 Evan came from a very conservative background. His parents were very strict in certain ways, both religiously and politically conservative. His house was filled with their political rhetoric, convincing the young man that their beliefs were correct, that they were always in the right. His folks would take him to church every Sunday, and would make sure he lived a life that fell in line with their beliefs. They didn't allow him to date for a long time, and they kinda jammed it into his head that his sexual needs were something he should be able to control. So for a long time, he felt ashamed whenever he pleasured himself, as if it were a failure, a sign of weakness in him. 

 Despite how that might sound, they were actually really good parents. They loved him and they always took good care of him, but Evan never quite felt like he belonged. He never really enjoyed and believed in the way of life they tried to fit him into. As he got older and understood the world a bit more, he realized this way of life seemed so... restrictive. He didn't want to be so bottled up and guarded. 

 Once he left home and went to college, he knew this was the time to loosen up. But, his upbringing had done a number on him, and he found it hard to be like his peers, to just let go and be stupid. He was ready to open up, but he found it hard. 

 Then he met Diana. 

 Diana was a free-spirit. She sensed something in him, and she had coaxed him along, bringing him out of his shell. She was the best thing that had happened to him. With her, he felt free. Free to be open and to express himself. To say and do things his parents would never let him say and do. Sure, he still felt a bit nervous about some racier topics, but Diana was always there to push him, force him out of his comfort zone. That's what led him to be standing in a porn shop. 

 These sights and sounds were unfamiliar to the 29 year old married man. Unlike most of his peers, he had never really gotten into porn or anything like that. Seeing all this erotic imagery, presented so brazenly, was a new experience for him. But not Diana. 

 She knew her way around the world of sex. She was far more checked in than he ever was. So as they entered and looked around, Evan stuck near her like lost puppy. 

 "C'mon hon." Diana urged. "Look around. Pick out something that YOU want. No judgment. Just look around and pick a movie out." 

 "Uh... okay." Evan said nervously, being thrown into the deep end. Evan and Diana parted, splitting up to canvas the store. 

 Evan was awash in sexual imagery. He saw racks of thin, sexy lingerie. He saw walls filled with sex related items, like lube and body oil. But what caught his eye were the racks and racks of porno DVDs. 

 There was a little of everything. He saw images of exposed, bare gigantic breasts. He saw pictures of dolled-up sluts, young and old. He saw images of excessively large penises of all shapes and sizes. He saw porn of every category. MILF. Teen. Lesbian. BDSM. Interracial. Cheating Wives. It was a festival for the senses. 

 Diana strolled through the place casually, glancing lazily at some stuff that caught her eye. She checked out the back of some DVD cases, and eyed the sex toys on the wall. Even for an opened minded girl like Diana, some of these toys looked rather... extreme. Obscenely large dildos, like, the size of an arm, hung on the walls. Some looked large but more manageable, like some of those eight or ten inchers. That was the sweet spot, Diana thought. Evan measured up at nine inches and that was more than enough for her. Any bigger would just be uncomfortable, she thought. She glanced to the side at some of those foot-long monster black rubber dongs, and she couldn't even comprehend trying to fit one of those inside of her. 

 Diana eyed some of the vibrators over the counter, when the cashier looked up at her again. 

 "Looking for anything in particular?" the girl said lazily. 

 "Oh, uh, no, just sorta browsing." Diana said amiably. She glanced across the store towards her husband, who was still browsing the shelves. "Just looking to, you know, spice things up a bit." 

 "Oh, I see." the girl said, standing up straight, pulling her elbows off the counter. "You looking for some movies?" 

 "Uh, yeah, I think so. Nothing too extreme, but something still pretty hot." Diana said. 

 "Are you looking for something romantic, or something a bit... filthy?" the girl asked. 

 "I would definitely prefer something more nasty. I don't watch porn looking for romance." Diana replied. The girl smiled. 

 "Agreed." she replied. "Well..." she began, rubbing her head in thought. "We have some good stuff here. What's your poison?" 

 "What do you mean?" Diana asked. 

 "Do you want movies with, like, a third person? Another dude or another chick." The girl offered. 

 "Oh, uh, no, I don't that's what either of us want." Diana replied. 

 "So, one on one stuff, I see. Do you want to watch, like, big tits, or... like, two chicks hooking up? Do you want to see something with, like, anal, or rough sex?" the store worker asked casually. 

 "Um, well..." Diana said, a bit taken aback at talking with a stranger about this subject matter. It almost felt like she was letting this girl into their sex life a bit. "I don't want to see, like, whips and leather, but yeah, it doesn't need to be gentle. I don't mind seeing some hot chicks getting their brains fucked out by some built dudes." 

 "Who does mind that??" The girl said agreeably with a wry smile. "Luckily, for that, there is a wide selection." 

 "Any recommendations?" I asked. 

 "Well, I would go with this brand, Lust Unlimited. They're a big brand, and they have a wide selection. But most of it is really just straight up, you know, chicks with big tits getting fucked by guys with huge dicks, which is all you really need, right?" the girl said. 

 "Right." Diana confirmed. 

 "I would take this one." the girl said, grabbing a movie off the shelf. "Big Tit Bitches Like it Rough 3. It's, like you said, nothing too extreme, but it's that good hard stuff we all like, right. I've watched it, and it's great. A good collection of scenes. It gets my personal, Jade Carlisle, seal of approval." 

 "Okay," Diana said, grabbing the DVD and scanning the cover, seeing a few, sexy porn sluts on the cover. "I'll give it a shot." 

 "You won't regret it." the young girl, Jade, said. As she said this, Evan turned the corner, a DVD in his hand. 

 "What'd you get?" Diana asked. 

 "Oh, uh..." he stammered nervously. She looked down at it. The title was 'Next Door Sluts Need it Bad 4'. On the cover were some younger sluts, bursting out of their supposedly conservative clothing. His wife looked up at him. "They are next door sluts, and it looks like they might, you know, need it bad." he justified. 

 "Okay. Looks good." Diana said warmly to her husband, approving of the porn he had picked out. Jade really took in Evan for the first time, letting her eyes scan over him. Diana was focused on Evan's nervous face, so she didn't notice the lust in the younger girl's eyes. 

 "Oh, that's a good choice." Jade spoke up. Evan turned to look at her, and Diana could sense the surprise in his eyes. Evan had probably rarely dealt with girls like her, with such a specific and unique look. A mixture of innocence, with her clingy, simple white top, and filthiness, with her leather skirt, combat boots, and many piercings. She was a sight that Evan had never seen before. So when he looked at her with wide eyes, she understood why. Diana was amused at how nervous this young woman seemed to make him. 

 "Oh... uh... thanks." he stammered. 

 "I tell you what... since you guys are such a cute couple, I'll throw in a third DVD for free. This one is called 'Illicit Encounters 5'. It's... super hot! If you like that one," she said, pointing at Evan's DVD, "...you'll LOVE this one." 

 "Oh! Cool." Diana said, walking over to the counter. 

 "So, if you guys find something you like in these... come back and tell me about it. This place has it all. I can give you exactly the thing you're looking for." Jade said as she rung up the happy couple. 

 "Okay, sounds good." Diana replied. As they paid and got everything bagged up, they turned and left. 

 "Hope to see you again!" Jade called out. As they left the store, Diana spoke up. 

 "What a sweet, nice young girl." Diana said knowingly. 

 "Jeez, Di." Evan began. "If I met that girl when I was her age... I would have been terrified of her." 

 "Hon, you were terrified of her now." Diana said, pulling him in close as he smiled. 

 ************** 

 Diana re-entered the porn store about a week later, alone this time. Within the past week, the happy couple watched all three DVDs they bought at the store. And because of what occurred during those viewings, Diana re-entered the store a bit more tentative than she had before. 

 The goal of buying this porn and bringing it into the bedroom was to spice things up. Diana liked good sex, and even though they had been married for a few years now, Evan was still a bit tentative at times. Diana sensed that he was still holding back, unsure if he should really let loose. Diana sensed there was a real, true sexual dynamo being held back, and she wanted to bring it to the surface. She had always sensed that within him, something that had been so buried by his conservative upbringing that he was terrified to bring it to the surface. She loved seeing those flashes of the animal within him. She loved being the one capable of bringing that out in him. 

 He was extremely handsome and pretty fit. He had a good job and brought in good money. He was kind, and smart, and good-hearted, but he was so reserved and guarded that many other women looked past him. He didn't let himself stand out, even though he was a total catch. But Diana looked deeper. She saw past his reserved nature. She saw what a catch he was, but he didn't. She wanted him to live up to his potential, to be unafraid of being himself. To not be tentative, both in life and in the bedroom. 

 So in that sense, the porn had begun to work. 

 They had let themselves get hot and bothered watching the nastiness contained within those DVDs. They had started with the DVD she had picked out. Contained were a few scenes of various, big-boobed sluts taking dick in whatever contrived scenarios they were directed to. It was good, but the focus was on these porn sluts' huge boobs. The men in the scenes would worship their huge tits, squeezing them, sucking them, fucking them, drowning their faces in softness. 

 Diana and Evan tried to replicate some of the things they saw in the movies, but some of the boob stuff were things Diana simply wasn't physically capable of replicating. Evan did his best, sucking at her sensitive nipples, squeezing what he could, but he couldn't fuck her tits like he saw in the movie. But the good thing was that it seemed like watching this movie really turned him on, and he was a bit more lusty in this encounter than he typically was. Diana was happy with that, not letting any self-consciousness about her smaller breasts get in the way of the pleasure Evan gave her with his sizable, nine-inch cock. 

 The next movie caused Diana a slight level of concern. It was the movie Evan picked out, the Next Door Sluts one. Diana imagined this as being a movie about innocent young women having gentle encounters with their partner. She couldn't have been farther off. It was essentially younger porn sluts in innocent clothing, acting all innocent, but clearly horny and gagging for sex. They would be all teasing and girly, but their monumental chests would be bursting from their tops, their round asses hanging out of their shorts.  

 

 

===

A lot of the scenes centered on the hot young slut next door, teasing their neighbor, or a friend's brother, or friend's father. These scenes were centered on seduction, the men being reluctant to being seduced but eventually giving in. The last scene centered on a young, blonde slut with huge, natural jugs and a full round ass, coming over to her married neighbor's house, teasing the husband when the wife wasn't around until they got down to business in his marital bed. And this was what started to make Diana nervous. 

 Obviously, Diana was aware that 'cheating' scenarios were common in porn, so it wasn't like they were offending her 'delicate sensibilities'. No, what bothered her was how much it seemed to turn Evan on. 

 Evan really picked up the pace, driving into her at a really good pace. And yes, the sex was fantastic, and they both came hard, but the subject matter that inspired this lust concerned her. Did the idea of cheating really turn him on? Was that his deep, dark secret fetish? 

 Evan sensed her concern once they settled down on the bed and the movie was over. 

 "So... you really liked that one, huh?" Diana asked. 

 "Yeah, I guess it was pretty good." Evan said with a coy smile. 

 "You seemed like you enjoyed that, uh, last scene?" Diana said. 

 "Yeah, it was hot." Evan said calmly. 

 "It seemed like you were REALLY into it." Diana said. 

 "What do you mean?" Evan asked. 

 "Well, it was just, you know... the scene was about some guy cheating on his wife with another woman. Does that kind of thing appeal to you?" Diana said. 

 "No! No, of course not." Evan began before shaking his head. "Hon... I knew this was a bad idea. I knew it." 

 "No, no, no." Diana said, putting her hand on her hubby's bare shoulder. 

 "You said no judgment." Evan replied, his puppy dog eyes meeting his wife's. 

 "Honey, I know. I know. I did. I'm really glad you enjoyed it, but you know... you definitely did respond. You have to admit that." Diana said. 

 "It was a good scene! Nothing more! You can tell when the actors are really into it, and they were. It felt, like, lusty, and genuine. Not robotic." Evan justified. Diana still looked a bit concerned. "Diana. It's not like I secretly think that cheating on my wife would be hot. Not at all! It's hot to watch, that doesn't mean I want to do it. I can watch a bank heist movie and think it looks cool but that doesn't mean I'm gonna rob a bank." 

 "I'm... I'm sorry." Diana said, shaking her head. "I know. I'm just being stupid." 

 "No, you're not." Evan said. "I love you honey, and that won't change." She smiled and nodded. 

 "I'm sorry for being so girly." Diana said. "I want you to enjoy these movies completely. I do. But... I'm a girl. I notice these things." 

 Evan gave her a kiss and pulled her in close as they fell asleep together. 

 They tried to watch the last movie the next night, the 'Illicit Encounters' movie that the porn store girl had recommended. They started to watch as they began their foreplay, and they were just getting into the moment when they realized the theme of this movie was basically cheating spouses, sneaking around, either to hotels, or with their neighbors. It had both men and women cheating. The men cheating on their wives with their secretary, or with some slut off the street, and the women cheating with their husband's hunky friend, or with some hung black guy. 

 At first, Evan started to get into it, before he realized what it was they were watching, and what Diana probably was thinking. So he slowed down and tried to fuck her like normal. Diana noticed her husband holding back like this, and this stuck with her all throughout the sex. 

 Diana wanted to head off this way of thinking quickly. She didn't want her husband to get too into the viewpoint that cheating on your wife could be hot and sexy and fun. She wanted to head this off at the pass. Sure, the sex they had watching the porn had been among their best, and she wanted to keep that going, she just didn't want any of that spousal cheating stuff. Her husband seemed to like that a bit too much. 

 Diana entered the store again, and she noticed the same girl that had helped them before, Jade. She was wearing the same thick leather boots, but this time, she was wearing what looked like a school girl skirt, a red checkered pattern. On top, she wore a black tank top, with some metal band's logo on the front. Her red hair still stood out, as did her striking eyes and jutting rack. She looked up and recognized Diana. 

 "Hi." Jade said, looking up as the married woman entered the store. 

 "Oh... uh, hi." Diana replied, unsure how friendly she should feel with the porn store girl. 

 "So... did you and hubby like the movies you bought? Did they scratch that itch?" Jade asked. 

 "Well... some of it was really good, but uh... I wasn't such a big fan of the whole... guys cheating on their wives aspect of the movies." Diana explained. 

 "Oh." Jade said. "I guess that makes sense. Don't want your hubby thinking about other women, someone younger, tighter... and better, you know?" 

 "Yeah, exactly." Diana confirmed. 

 "So, you don't want to get 'You're So Much Better than My Wife' volumes 9-12 then, right?" Jade asked with a smile. 

 "Wait, they actually make movies specifically about that now?" Diana asked. 

 "Oh, totally. And they are super hot too, but...uh, clearly, that's not your thing." Jade said. "But you're still looking for more, right?" Jade asked. 

 "Yeah... maybe something a bit more tame." Diana suggested. 

 "Gotcha." Jade said. 

 A few minutes later, Diana left the store, three new DVDs in hand. "Sensual Encounters", "Just Us Girls", and "MILFs Love Huge Cocks 7", all by Jade's recommendation. They all seemed safe. The sensual one looked like something a bit softer, the 'Just Us Girls' one was a lesbian porn, and the MILFs one was about older women, obviously. No danger there, right? 

 ************** 

 "FUCK! I can't believe an older woman can fuck me so much better than my wife can!" A guy moaned out onscreen. The action was hot on-screen, and it was as hot off the screen. 

 Neither Diana nor Evan had enjoyed the sensual porn or the lesbian one. Both had been a bit too softcore, but luckily, the MILF one picked up the slack. Watching a bunch of older, slutty, busty women getting railed was surprisingly appealing to both of them. They had gotten into a good groove, getting really hot and heavy, until the last scene. 

 All the other scenes had been about older women seducing either college guys, or a friend of the woman's son, or the son of the woman's friend, stuff like that. But the last one dealt with a married man and a MILF crossing paths in a bar. He kept trying to push her away, but she was aggressive, trying to seduce the taken man by practically throwing her hot body in his face. And of course, eventually, he gave in, and hot sex ensued. 

 The married couple in the bed had already gotten going to a good pace once this scene happened, and both were kind of lost to the pleasure. But once the scene on screen picked up, Diana couldn't help but notice Evan pick up the pace, really getting into it. He wasn't acknowledging the action on-screen. He gave no-sign that it was affecting him, other than his throbbing cock. It had never felt bigger than it had the moment that guy on-screen was having nasty, lusty, cheating sex. 

 It was clear, despite his protestations otherwise, that Evan's cock loved the idea of cheating on his spouse. It turned him on. He was a good man, a good husband who would never cheat. But, that being said, the thought of cheating greatly appealed to that dick of his. It had begun to awaken something within him. It sizzled deep inside of him, the lust, the betrayal... he loved it. 

 The sex was great. Evan had never fucked her so well, but the cost might be too high. These sizzling thoughts of cheating were filling his brain, and that was dangerous territory for a woman to be introducing her hubby to. 

 So, knowing that she might be giving up some better sex, she suggested to Evan that she didn't think the porn was a good thing to put into the bedroom. Evan was a good husband and went along with his wife. Diana hoped that would be that. 

 She could only hope that bug in his ear hadn't gotten too far. 

 ************ 

 For about a week or so, their sex returned to normal. They had fun, but it never reached the lusty highs that it did during their porn viewing. But then, about a week or so later, things began to pick-up. Evan seemed to get really into it, and the sex got as good as ever. As soon as she got home, it seemed, he was all over her. She didn't know what caused the flip to switch, but she didn't care. 

 This went on for a bit, Diana and Evan having good, regular sex. Evan was fucking her even harder, wearing her out. Diana had always controlled the pace, but now, Evan was running the show, being more demanding in bed, more manly. And Diana loved it! It was so good! Her husband had started to become the dynamic lover she always knew he could be. It was fantastic. Diana was happy. Things couldn't be better. 

 Then she discovered Evan's secret box. 

 Evan had this leather lock-box type thing he had gotten from a flea market. It was nice looking, and they got it cheap, but they didn't really know what to do with it. So they just put the box in the bottom of the closet and forgot about it. But, as Diana was putting clothes away, she noticed the box seemed... off. It looked like it had been moved slightly. It had been in one spot for so long that being in a slightly different spot was noticeable. Then, making sure Evan was not about to barge in, she bent over and opened the box. 

 Inside the deep box were neatly lined DVDs, spines facing up. And as she read the titles, her eyes widened in shock. In the box was porno. Not the porno they had bought together, though. Secret porn that Evan was hiding from her. Porn he didn't want her to see. They appeared to be a few DVDs of a series, and when she saw the title of the series, her jaw literally dropped. 

 'You're So Much Better than My Wife' 

 In the box were volumes 9-12 of this series, the exact ones Jade had mentioned off-hand to Diana. Diana examined the covers. Some of them featured husbands next to their plain wives while eyeing up a barely clothed porn slut. One had a slutty, big-titted porn star hanging off a respectable husband's arm. One had a husband hooking up with another woman with his wife around the corner. Diana read the description on the back of the case. 

 "Is marriage getting old? Is the same boring pussy not enough for you anymore? Then 'You're So Much Better than My Wife' is the answer. Watch some our best male talent live every husband's dream, cheating on his boring old wife with the hottest, sluttiest, nastiest porn stars we could find. Watch these men betray their wives for sex that is SO much better! Watch them trade in boring old married life for the nastiest, filthiest fucking imaginable. This one has it all! Big breasted sluts! Anal sex! Dirty talk! Sizzling hot cheating scenes! Boring, plain wives being humiliated as their husbands fuck much hotter women! You asked for it, you got it! All of it here on 'You're So Much Better than My Wife'!" 

 Diana was floored. Absolutely floored. Her husband was watching porn designed specifically to simulate cheating on his wife with another woman. This was officially his fantasy, no doubt about it. Despite her protests, Evan was still watching this stuff, still fantasizing about the one thing Diana feared he was. The one thing he knew she was afraid of. He had clearly lied to her about enjoying it, feeling too ashamed to mention this to his own wife. 

 Was this why their sex life had picked up? Was he fucking her harder because of these movies? He was getting home earlier than usual. Maybe he was coming home early, watching this filth, and taking out that lust on her. Maybe this was his foreplay. Maybe this was what he was thinking about when he fucked her. 

 The thought had taken a firm grip on him. Diana had accidently allowed these infectious thoughts into the bedroom, and they had taken hold in her normally shy, guarded husband. 

 Diana only hoped she hadn't unleashed a monster. 

 Diana rejoined her husband before he could notice her absence. His hottest fantasy was a guy cheating on his wife. Well, she vowed to not give him even the slightest chance of ever making this fantasy a reality. She vowed to stay by his side whenever she could, and make sure he didn't get up to any trouble. 

 He had been acting normal, and it wasn't like he was gone for hours on end, so he must have bought these on his way home from work. But the advantage she had was that he didn't know she knew about his hidden box of porn. And while she couldn't keep an eye on him 24/7, she could keep an eye on that porn collection, and see if it grew. 

 ************* 

 Evan and Diana were still having regular sex, but Diana couldn't help but notice that the sex was getting a bit rougher. Evan had become far more demanding. And judging by the material he had been watching, Diana could see why. 

 His porn collection kept growing. Diana was distressed to find that this secret library of porn had grown, nearly filling his secret box with all sorts of sick filth. At first, he simply completed the collection, now owning 'You're So Much Better than My Wife' Volumes 1-13. 

 She tried to watch them, to see the appeal, but she could only watch a little before turning it off in disgust. Diana watched it up to the point where in the scene; a busty, slutty woman was riding her best friend's husband's cock while holding his wife's face in between her ass-cheeks. The slut kept humiliating the wife, telling her she was so much better than her, and that the only thing she was good for was sucking her asshole while the slut handles her man. 

 Needless to say, she couldn't watch any more. 

 After a little bit, Evan's porn collection branched out, and it was if the titles told the story, told the story of his fetishes growing and becoming more focused. 

 "Illicit Encounters" Vol. 1-6 

 "Big Breasted Sluts Drive Men Nuts" 

 "Ass Worship" Vol. 1-4 

 "Nasty Whores Get it Rough" 

 "Backdoor Teen Sluts" Vol 1-4 

 "Emo Chicks Need Big Dicks" 

 "Fiery Redheads Need it Bad" 

 She even found a membership card to the porn store, for preferred customers. So it was clear, he had gotten over his hesitance to be at the porno shop. 

 In summation, after many visits to the porn store, his fantasies had grown. Now, judging by the movies, his ideal fantasy was to cheat on his wife with a big-breasted teen emo slut with bright red-hair. 

 Diana suddenly knew exactly who was occupying his fantasies. 

 ************ 

 The wife entered the porn store again, trying to ascertain the situation. Evan claimed he had been working late these last few days, but after finding all those movies, she began to have some doubts. 

 He couldn't... he wasn't actually cheating on her, right? She knew him. She understood him. She loved him. Could she be so wrong? 

 Part of her was afraid she would catch Evan in the act of buying more porn, but luckily, he wasn't there. But then again, neither was Jade. The counter was occupied by some swarthy looking older guy, at least for a little bit, when Jade entered the store, clearly running late. 

 "Sorry, Jeff." Jade called out. 

 "Well, it's about time." The older man growled. They chatted for a few minutes, before Jade set her stuff down behind the counter and the guy left. As he did, Jade caught sight of Diana. 

 "Hey!" she called out. Diana approached her cautiously. 

 "Um, hi." Diana said. 

 "So, things are going well, I'm guessing." Jade said with a smile. She was wearing a white blouse with a dark, big leather skirt. Her lip-ring and garish make-up caught the wife's eye again. 

 "Uh, what do you mean?" Diana asked. 

 "I heard you embraced your husband's fantasy." Jade began. "You know, the whole cheating fantasy thing? And it's, like, totally the right call, in my opinion. With that kind of thing, I think its way better to just embrace it than to try to suppress it. That'd be, like, really stupid, and anyone that would try to would be an idiot. When you do that, when you try to contain something like that, it'll just explode." 

 Diana was irritated with this young girl. What did she know? What did this little young woman know about sex and marriage? Diana didn't not need to be lectured about sex from a girl like her. 

 "Oh, uh... yeah." Diana said, playing along. 

 "And I gave him all the good stuff too." Jade said with a wide smile. "That's some good shit, right?" 

 "Uh, yeah." Diana agreed. 

 "It's kind of a new genre, but that stuff is starting to fly off the shelves." Jade added. 

 "Cool." Diana said. 

 "Oh, I told Evan, but, um, since he's bought so much, I told him he could pick out a free sex toy, under 50 bucks, of course. So, I'm guessing you're here to pick something out?" Jade asked. 

 "I, uh, I don't really need a new dildo or vibrator anything like that." Diana replied. 

 "You sure? Your man might not always be there for you, but that dildo will be." Jade said, holding my eyes. My attention was grabbed. 

 "What do you mean?" Diana asked. 

 "Oh, you know, hubby might be busy on those long days of work when you really need it, and so... you might have to get used to taking care of yourself." Jade said coolly. Diana narrowed her eyes at Jade. Was this little slut threatening her? Was she coming after her man? Was she trying to take her man from her? Jade sensed the tension coming from the married woman. 

 "One more thing." Jade asked, not breaking her chipper demeanor. "I got ahold of this movie. Your husband was really interested in it, but I had to download it and put it on this blank disk. But here, I'll let you take it. It's on the house." 

 "I don't think I'm interested." Diana said, realizing she was dealing with a conniving rival here. 

 "Trust me, Diana... you should really watch this." Jade insisted firmly. Jade smiled as Diana reluctantly took the disk and swiftly left the store. She didn't see the smile cross the younger girl's plump lips. 

 Diana gathered her thoughts. This girl was dangerous. There was something dark in her, something scheming and twisted. As soon as Evan got home, she would sit down and talk this whole thing out. Tell him he could not buy any more of that twisted porno, not go into that dirty store and not deal with that twisted slut. It was over. 

 But then there was the DVD in her hand. She was curious about the contents. When she got home and realized Evan was still at work, she didn't hesitate to pop the DVD into the player. And once the images emerged on the screen, Diana's heart dropped. 

 She was too late. 

 The first thing she saw was that it wasn't porn. It was security footage. The sights and sounds of the porno store, and judging by the date stamp, it was from a few days after Diana cut porn out of her marriage. 

 ************** 

 Evan Prentiss entered the porn store nervously. He had felt nervous entering here with his wife, and coming here on his own made him feel even more on edge. He didn't want to be seen like one of those creepy guys that hung out at porn shops. But he had to come back. He had to. 

 Diana had recommended that they cut out the porn. It wasn't working for her. And Evan tried to just forget them, to look past them. But he couldn't. He couldn't just forget. He couldn't unsee the things he had seen. 

 Despite his initial trepidation, he had loved the porn. Since he had so little experience with the stuff, seeing it for the first time was a revelation. Seeing so much sexy, bare flesh, seeing such huge tits and round, juicy asses, seeing people act so filthy... it was amazing. It sizzled off the screen, burning into his mind. He was a rapt audience.  

 

 

===

Watching such slutty, nasty girls taking it so rough, seeing them treat cocks with such loving worship, seeing them take it hard in every hole, hearing them spit such dirty talk... it was like discovering there was a whole new world out there. He couldn't get enough. 

 As the filth ratcheted up, Evan got more and more into it. This came to a peak when watching the scenes featuring men cheating on their wives, cheating with hotter, sexier, bustier and by all visual standards, better women. There was just something so sizzlingly hot about that. Just ignoring all the things that makes an actual marriage function, the meshing of two hearts, two personalities. Sure, looks played a part, but what brought two people together was whether they were kindred spirits. But to ignore all that, to trade that all in for a woman who is simply cosmetically superior, a woman who is more gorgeous, has much bigger, much better breasts, a rounder juicier ass, longer, firmer legs... being that irresponsible, being that reckless... it was a huge turn-on for the sheltered married man. 

 He had been raised to do everything right. Treat women with respect and love. But now, seeing the total opposite of this, seeing men supposedly being so callous to their wives in exchange for good pussy, it was an addicting thing to see. He couldn't get enough. 

 Evan loved his wife completely, and he would never cheat on her. But he couldn't get those sexual fantasies those porn movies had inspired out of his head. They were so hot, so raw, so sexy, he couldn't stop thinking about it. Even though his wife had asked to stop with the porno stuff, it was those images that were playing in his head when he fucked his wife. It was those images that made him lose control. It was those porn sluts that made him cum, not his wife. 

 In his sheltered world, being with someone like Diana was like being with sexual fire. She was so willing and so open to trying new things in the bedroom, she just seemed like the perfect coach for someone like Evan, to bring him along in the world of sex. But now, after watching these movies, it seemed like there was a whole new world out there. And the lessons Diana taught him were starting to seem rather tame in comparison. 

 Diana was very pretty and quite fit and slim, but she didn't compare to those women in those movies. Evan obviously knew that those porn stars were fetishized, idealized women. He still couldn't help but compare them to his wife, not only with looks, but with style and sexual charisma. Those women on screen fucked like a whirlwind, like a hurricane in the bedroom. And Diana, she fucked like a gentle breeze. 

 Evan began to wonder if he was missing out. 

 Those porn stars used their luscious bodies as weapons, weapons designed to make men explode. And they were very good at it. And Diana, she didn't have the weapons to match up. She didn't have the round butt or massive rack built to pleasure men in the visceral, raw way they were pleasured in the movies. Evan could never experience that pleasure with Diana. He could never get that pleasure in real life. Only in his fantasies. 

 This is what brought Evan back to the porn store. He couldn't stop thinking about the images he had seen. Those images were so raw and hot and sexy that they were practically addicting to the naïve husband. 

 It wasn't so bad that he wanted to indulge this new interest, right? It was something new, a shiny new toy. Diana had wanted to take the porn out of their bedroom, but it would be a lie if she claimed she didn't like what the porn had brought out in him. She had enjoyed how vigorous their lovemaking had become once the nasty imagery got in Evan's blood. So it wouldn't be the worst thing for Evan to keep a secret porn collection. Diana would get to reap the benefits, and she would be none the wiser. 

 What's the worst that could happen? 

 He kept his head down, still slightly nervous at being caught. He had to calm himself down. It wasn't like his folks would leap out from around the corner and shame him for being here. He was there for a little bit, scanning the shelves, his eyes feasting on all the exposed boobs and butts. There was so much to choose from that he couldn't decide what he wanted. He wasn't there long when someone spoke to him, catching his attention. 

 "Hi." The cheery female voice said. Evan looked up and recognized the same girl from before, the red-head that worked there. Evan was again taken aback by this young woman's outfit. She was wearing a blood-red tank top, a low-cut one, showing off the pale, creamy skin of the tops of her breasts and her deep cleavage. She wore matching-lip-stick, and Evan noticed she had her ears, lip, nose, and tongue all pierced. Typically, Evan didn't like this look, but for her, it kinda worked. It fit her goth image. Her red-hair really contrasted with her creamy skin, making it look striking. 

 Down below, she again wore those big, chunky, shiny leather combat boots. She wore a skirt with straps and metal loops adorning it. It was a jarring look, something out of a world Evan didn't know anything about. It was striking and shocking, but somehow, yet again, the look worked for her. 

 "Oh, uh, hi." Evan said nervously. 

 "You were in here a few days ago, weren't you?" she asked, pointing at him. "With your wife, right?" 

 "Uh, yeah." Evan said, nodding. 

 "Okay, I remember you guys." Jade said. "So... did you like the movies you bought?" 

 "Oh, uh, yeah, they were pretty good." Evan said. "Some of them were, anyway." he added, remembering the softer stuff Diana bought on her second trip here. He didn't really care for that stuff. 

 "Which ones did you like better?" Jade asked. 

 "Uh, I don't know..." Evan said, unsure how open he could be. 

 "Oh, c'mon. You can tell me." Jade said. "Did you like the softer stuff, or did you like the stuff that's a little more... rough?" 

 "Mmm, well, I don't know..." Evan stammered. Jade saw the apprehension in his eyes. 

 "You liked the rough stuff, didn't you?" she said, smiling wide. Evan blushed. Jade reached out and put her hand on his arm. "It's okay. I'm with you. I can't stand that weak-ass shit." 

 "Oh. Okay." Evan said. 

 "So, what did you like?" Jade asked. "Now, I think I remember what movies you guys got, and some of them got pretty gnarly. And looking at you, and knowing that you liked some of the rougher stuff, I'm guessing the rough stuff is what really got you hot under the collar. And the hottest scenes in any of those movies, in my opinion, are the scenes where the guy is cheating on his wife." 

 Jade noticed his eyes flash as she hit his tastes right on the head. Jade smiled and continued, knowing she had him on the hook. 

 "There's just something about those scenes, isn't there? A guy, so trying to be loyal, but so obviously in need of something new. Something better. And then some total slut comes up, and she just doesn't give a fuck. She just goes for it, she just goes for the man she wants, and she just drives him wild. Just puts it all out there, like a total slut." Jade purred, putting some extra oomph on the word slut. "There's just something about that. A girl being so... aggressive, so forceful, so slutty, not caring that a guy is married. Stealing another woman's man, proving that she is so much better than his stupid, boring, ugly wife. God, that stuff always makes me cum so hard!" 

 "Yeah." Evan agreed. While Evan was taken aback by how open she was, he was too distracted by her sizzling descriptions of those scenes to really react. Jade saw the heat in the married man's eyes, and she knew he was as turned on as she was. She looked up at him, nipples pointed out through her top. 

 "You know, they've got entire movies built around that kind of thing. Just think, hours and hours of men cheating on their stupid, plain wives with the hottest, sluttiest, bustiest sluts they can find." Jade said. 

 "Really?" Evan asked, surprised but relieved that this kind of thing had an audience, that he wasn't weird for enjoying it. 

 "Yeah, they are my absolute fave'." Jade said. She led him down the aisles of porn DVD's before reaching over to scoop a few up. She kept her legs straight as she did, jutting out her round butt at the married man, her skirt rising up her thighs, exposing more of her creamy pale skin. "They're called 'You're So Much Better Than my Wife'. It has it all. Young sluts, old sluts, sluts of every kind, really, fucking married men, making them admit that what they can offer is so much better than what their wives can. It's just...awesome. Here are volumes 9-12. These are the hottest ones, in my opinion." 

 "I'm not so sure." Evan replied, looking at the DVD cases she just handed him. But his eyes widened as he looked at the back, seeing such gorgeous, filthy, nasty sluts going wild on some married cock. His eyes went wide, his breath deepened, and Jade smiled. 

 She knew she just made a sale. 

 ************* 

 The image on the screen went to a video from the same camera of the store, the timestamp a couple days later. Diana kept watching, wondering where this was heading. 

 She watched Evan go into the store again. This time, he knew right where he was going. He went to the section Jade had led him to. He thumbed through the DVDs on the shelf, before grabbing a bunch of DVDs off the shelf. He went quickly to the cashier, where Jade was waiting. 

 She smiled and admired the stack of DVDs in his hands 

 "Wow, 'You're So Much Better Than my Wife' Volumes 1-8 and 13. Completing the set, huh?" Jade asked. She was wearing a pink tank top this time, which contrasted with her lacy, black skirt and black fishnets. 

 "Uh, yeah." Evan replied. 

 "That's some good shit, isn't it?" Jade asked. 

 "Yeah... I can't stop thinking about it." Evan admitted. "I can't get enough." 

 "Volume 13 is really good. It just came out. There's this one scene where this slut is making this married guy lick her asshole for, like, the whole scene. And by the end, he's talking about how he loves her butthole more than his wife. And it's, like, fucking... transcendent." Jade marveled. 

 "Oh..." Evan said, not sure what to say to that. 

 "Well, there is a lot more where this came from." Jade said, holding up the stack of DVD's. "And, if you're gonna be buying these in such heavy quantities, you really should get a membership card. You save money on everything you buy, plus, you get free shit. Overall, more filth for your buck." 

 Evan thought it over for a second. Would he really need a membership card at a porn store? Did he want a badge showing that he was a frequent customer at a porn store? What if someone found out? But then he remembered that nastiness within these movies, and how hot it got to him, and how he couldn't stop thinking about them. How watching these movies had been more sexually enjoyable than being in bed with his wife. 

 "Yeah, okay." Evan agreed, knowing he would be back again for more. 

 But the bad thing was, the slut on the other side knew he'd be back too. 

 ************** 

 Diana wasn't sure if this girl was interested in her husband, or just a really good salesman. But, either way, she had Evan on the hook. 

 He began coming to the porn store practically daily, feeding his new found hobby. And there was footage of all of it, every time he entered the store, and each time, Jade was there. 

 Every time Evan entered, she smiled. Every time he was there, she made sure to chat him up. She would talk to him about how he liked the movies, and he became more open and willing to talk. He would talk more about specific scenes, and specific actresses. And she would recommend new movies, based on what he liked. But at times, it felt like she was guiding him along. It felt like Evan was simply a pliable ball of clay, and Jade was the one molding him, shaping him into the perfect man for her. 

 First, he bought up any movies centering around cheating husbands he could get his hands on. Once he was done with that, he moved on to other aspects of the movies he liked, other things he couldn't get enough of. 

 Every time he got too far off the plot, she pulled him back. For example, Evan started talking about how he liked slim, lithe, fit girls, but Jade turned the tables on him. 

 "Are you sure?" Jade asked. "Don't you like girls with big tits?" she said, jutting her chest out to him, beginning to put on the sales pitch. "I mean, those slim girls can be nice sometimes, but there is nothing quite like a pair of huge, soft, fleshy tits! If you'd ever been with a girl with massive tits, you'd never go back to anything else. Do you have any idea what it's like to practically drown in softness?" 

 Minutes later, he was walking out of the store, a copy of "Big Breasted Sluts Drive Men Nuts" tucked neatly in a bag. 

 The next time he was in, the footage showed Jade and Evan chatting in an otherwise empty store, their conversation looking more like one between friends than a saleswoman-customer one. But the subject matter was one most friends don't openly discuss. 

 "So, I know you're starting to get into really big boobs," Jade began, leaning against a shelf casually. "And I can't blame you for that, but you would be remiss if you ignored the booty." 

 "What?" Evan asked. 

 "You can never ignore the booty, Evan." she said with a laugh. "The butt... the ass. Evan, Evan, Evan... a girl's ass can be a work of art. You really need to train yourself to appreciate them. Like, look at me." she said, turning around. "Look at my butt, Evan." 

 "Um..." he stammered, not able to stop himself from glancing down. She was wearing a tight leather skirt which molded to her full round ass. Each round, full juicy cheek jutting outward, barely contained by the leather. It was as if she wore this tight skirt with the specific purpose of showing off her rear end. She reached back and slapped one of the round cheeks lightly, causing it to jiggle, arresting his vision. 

 "You see, I love my ass. I heard all the comments in school, girls calling me fat, thinking guys wanted a rail-thin type of girl. But trust me, once I got a man into bed and they got to experience this..." she said, pressing one finger into her leather-clad ass-cheek, the supple flesh indenting lightly. "Even the proudest of guys would follow me around like a puppy dog." 

 "Uh..." he said, not knowing how to respond. 

 "In the right hands, a girl can use her ass as a weapon. A simple shake..." she said, shaking her butt lightly from side-to-side. "Can drive a man to his knees. Girl's with those thin, weak, cute little butts can't get the job done. But when a girl has an ass like mine, an ass so round... and full... and juicy... and perfect..." she said, squeezing one of her ass-cheeks in her palm through the leather. "An ass like mine could break a man. Make him fall to his knees in worship. Make him want to squeeze the cheeks... kiss them..." she said, sliding her other hand down and grabbing the other cheek. "Maybe pull the cheeks apart and lick in-between." 

 Evan's eyes were rapt as she spoke, her hands miming her words, pulling her ass-cheeks apart slightly. The tension was broken as a man walked into the store. Jade turned around and smiled at Evan knowingly. 

 Minutes later, Evan walked out the door, "Ass Worship" Volumes 1-4 in his hands. 

 Another time, Evan started to admit he kinda liked moves with MILF's in them. But Jade was quick to reply. 

 "Are you sure? I mean, I don't know, aren't younger sluts kinda better? I mean, they have way more energy, they're prettier, their skin is just so smooth and silky and unblemished. They're, like, pulsing with need! And plus, there is nothing quite like a pair of big, teenage tits! Right?" Jade said proudly, pushing out her jugs subtly. Evan couldn't help but glance down at her chest, before looking back at her smiling face. 

 He walked out of the store with "Backdoor Teen Sluts" Volumes 1-4 in his hands. 

 Another time, they were talking about tattoos. Evan was saying how he liked girls without tattoos, that he thought tattoos were a bit trashy. Jade was happy to reply. 

 "But, that's kind of the point, right? The type of girl that is super hot, super slutty, that isn't the type to be afraid of. To mark their bodies permanently, and show off that they are not the girl next door. They are something more. I mean, look at me, I have tattoos, and I'm super slutty!" 

 "What?" Evan said, a bit taken aback. 

 "Yeah, here, look." she said, turning around and pulling up the hem of her shirt, exposing her tramp stamp to the married man. It was an ornate design, tendrils of the design trailing along the upper curves of her rear-end. Sprouting from these tendrils were hearts, but each one had a dagger going through each one. "I have other ones, too, but if you want to see those, you'll have to buy me a drink, first." she lilted. 

 Evan smiled nervously. Minutes later, he walked out of the door, "Emo Chicks Need Big Dicks" in hand. 

 On this next visit, they discussed hair color. 

 "I don't know." Jade began. "I think blondes are just a dime a dozen, you know? And I think brunettes are kinda plain. But red-heads, that's where it's at. Red-heads are filthy. Trust me." Jade marveled, shaking her hair. "I tell you, Evan, you get a red-head between the sheets, and you won't go back." 

 One less copy of "Fiery Redheads Need it Bad" remained in the store by the end of the day. 

 Diana was unsure if Evan was even aware that the young redhead was manipulating him. From afar, Diana could see her attraction to him with the way she acted and how she flirted with him. But Evan might be too naïve to see her intentions. 

 Unfortunately, he was about to. 

 ************** 

 Evan was in the porno shop again, drifting in the aisles, looking for something to slake his new addiction. Deep down, he knew he was overdoing things. A married man shouldn't be buying this much porno. He shouldn't be spending this much money on such filthy things, especially when he knew he could find a lot of this stuff online for a lot less money. But, he kept coming back for more. He didn't know why, but he did. He couldn't get enough. He just kept ending up in this store. 

 Now, as he roamed the aisles, he didn't know what he wanted. He had seen so much over these past few weeks that things that would have driven him wild then now seemed like well-worn territory. He was looking for something new. Something fresh. Something hot. 

 "Undecided?" Jade asked, emerging from around the corner, startling the married man. 

 "Oh, uh, yeah, I guess." Evan replied. "Any recommendations, Jade?" 

 Jade smiled. She was wearing all-black, a black, low-cut tank top with some metal band logo on the front. She wore a frilly, all-black lace skirt, black fishnets, and her standard heavy, black, leather boots. Her black outfit and dark make-up was especially set-off by her creamy-pale skin. 

 "Is the same old stuff getting a bit old?" Jade asked. 

 "Well, yeah, it's like, I don't know, it's all still good. But I kinda want something more." Evan replied. 

 "I know exactly what you mean." Jade said. "There is only so much you can see before you need to step it up. You can only fantasize so much about before you need something... more." 

 With that Jade stepped forward and placed her hand on Evan's crotch, squeezing his swollen member. Evan jumped back, as if burned, and looked around, realizing he was alone with this younger girl. 

 "Oh, c'mon, Evan. There's no need to hide anything from me. Why do you think you keep coming back in here, day after day? It's not just for the porn. Face it, Evan, you've been coming in here for me." Jade argued. 

 "What? Of course not!" Evan replied. 

 "You have to admit the fact that I know more about you than your wife ever did. I know your secrets. The things you're afraid to tell her. You're not afraid to tell me. You've been open with me about your deepest, darkest most twisted fantasies, because you feel what I do. A connection, a burning, simmering attraction. A dark, depraved lust for a girl who is so different from your boring... stupid... ugly... wife." Jade said firmly, stepping forward again and taking his rock hard cock into her grip, squeezing it hard. "Mmm, I think baby likes what I have to say."  

 

 

===

"No... Jade... ugh..." Evan grunted, not pulling away. 

 "C'mon, Evan, you've been checking out my tits since the first time you came in here!" Jade said brightly. 

 "Jade, please..." Evan said, sweeping her hand away. 

 "I don't blame you for checking me out, Evan. Let's face it, I've got your wife beat in every way. I'm younger, I'm hotter, I've got a way better body, way bigger tits... I'm younger, tighter and better." Jade claimed. 

 "Jade, you've got the wrong idea." Evan panted out, panicking. 

 "You know, it's always you straight-laced guys that are deep down the most twisted. It's always you nice, hard-working, upstanding member of society type guys who want to get kinky as fuck in the bedroom. You marry the boring, yuppie girls who act like they know stuff but really don't know shit. And deep down, you want girls like me. You don't want a nice, boring, pretty girl. You want a nasty, slutty, whorish little tease... like me. You want a girl with tattoos, pierced nipples, and a clit ring." Jade purred. Evan's cock jumped in her hand. "Mmm, baby likes that! A normal, handsome man, works nine to five, goes home to his plain, happy wife, but he can't stop thinking about the slutty teenage redhead with the big tits and the piercings that works at the porn shop. You got tired of staring at your wife's bony ass, so you started coming in here and staring at my juicy one. You go home to a wife who dresses in white, but you can't stop thinking about the slut dressed in black. You want to resist, but you can't stop thinking about what color thong I'm wearing. You could go home to your nice, big house, your plain wife, and your boring, daily routine, or you could sneak off to the slutty goth girl's cheap apartment and spend the night getting your brain's fucked out." 

 "Jade, uh, th... this isn't right. I'm married." Evan stammered. She stepped forward, forcing Evan's back against a wall. 

 "I think this throbbing married cock says otherwise. You've never done anything wrong at all, have you?" Jade began, squeezing his cock more firmly. "You've always done what other people wanted you to do. You've always played by the rules. But you're starting to realize being bad is so much more fun. Evan, my body was built for bad things. I'm one of those dirty sluts you were warned about." With that, she slipped her hand under the hem of his slacks and his underwear, till her fingers wrapped around the warm skin of his bare, turgid weapon. "Wow! I can feel how much you want this! So big and fucking hard! This cock SO wants to do bad things. This cock so wants you to cheat on your wife. You've been dreaming about it. Fantasizing about it. And I have to. I so want to fuck a married man. Just the thought of a guy throwing out his vows just cause I'm that fucking sexy, that he wants me that bad... God, I want it! Think about it, Evan. This cock is just moments away from being buried up to the balls in a bare, wet, teen cunt! And when it's done there, it will be buried in a teenage girl's asshole, a privilege all married cocks deserve. Those big hands are gonna be squeezing my big, bare tits! This cock is about to have an eager young mouth sucking it off and swallowing every drop of cum in your balls. You're this close to feeling my tongue stud against the underside of your shaft. That married mouth is about to be filled with some hard nipples, and a teenage pussy, and a sexy, tight asshole. Why throw away all that pleasure? Why not just... indulge?" 

 Evan was wondering the very same thing. Why not just give in? He couldn't think straight as the teenage slut kept her hand in his pants, stroking his cock perfectly. Evan was always so tentative and careful and respectful with Diana. He had never been driven this wild by a woman, until now. This teenage, goth, redhead slut was turning him on more than any other woman had before. He didn't know what it was about her. Her luscious, hot body. Those mammoth, fleshy breasts. That round, juicy ass. Her gorgeous, teasing face. Her striking green eyes. Her dark sense of style, and how that combined with her natural good looks gave her a darkly sexual edge. Was it her tattoos and piercings, something so foreign to the straight-laced married man? Was it her obvious knowledge of all things sex that made her so appealing? He couldn't put his finger on what it was about her that drew him to her, but his lust for this goth teenage slut was real. He didn't realize it before, but she was the ideal, nasty slut of his fantasies. 

 He had spent the last few weeks fantasizing about this kinda thing, being ambushed by an aggressive, unrelenting slut. Just the thought of it, the thought of such irresponsibility, of such casual betrayal, it drove him nuts. How good must that sex be to betray someone you love? It would have to be amazing to make the sex worth it. He had always told himself it was just a fantasy, but now he was being presented with the reality, and it was as hot as the fantasies. He had an aggressive teenage slut with the body of a porn star targeting his married cock. He had to decide what was more important. His loyalty to his wife, or living out his sizzling hot fantasies? The needs of his heart or the needs of his cock? Was he willing to risk his entire marriage just to see the luscious naked body of a 19-year-old porn shop worker? Was he willing to throw his marriage away just to indulge his curiosity and see what kind of sexy tattoos marked this gorgeous slut's pale, creamy skin? He wanted to be loyal to his wife, but Jade and these pornos had him wondering if he was missing out on something. Did Evan want to go through life always on the straight and narrow, never taking any risks, never seeing the other side of life? Could he go through life never knowing the pleasures of a pair of giant, soft breasts? Could he live with himself not knowing just how mighty and powerful that ass of hers was? Did he really want to go through his life never spending at least one night with one, just, total and complete slut? Did he want to just subsist on married sex and never experience a lusty encounter with a sex expert? Was Diana really enough for him, or did he need more? 

 Diana had done so much for him, bringing him out of shell, seeing something in him that no one ever did. Evan loved her and was grateful for all that she had done. He owed her so much. He certainly owed her enough to not just cheat on her. He shouldn't just betray her at the first opportunity. He should be a good husband and resist, but that just seemed so difficult. Cheating sounded so good! 

 Evan looked down as the teasing slut chewed her lip. Evan glanced at her fault- line of creamy cleavage. She was sexy, no-doubt, but she was certainly the wrong choice. Diana was a successful, professional woman, a good-looking, attractive wife. Jade was a 19-year-old slut who worked in a porn store. She certainly didn't have a lot of future prospects, and any man should know better and aim higher than this trashy goth slut. Sure, she was sexy, incredibly sexy, but it was clear she was bad news. 

 The choice should be obvious, right? 

 *************** 

 Diana was nervous as the security footage ended. For a few moments, the screen was black. Diana was watching, nervous at what she was about to see. Deep down, she knew...she knew what she was about to see. 

 But when footage re-appeared on screen, and the setting had changed from the inside of the porn store to footage of a video camera perfectly positioned inside of a bedroom, even though she suspected it, Diana's heart still dropped. 

 **************** 

 Evan burst into the bedroom, the young slut wrapped around him as they furiously made out. Jade's legs were wrapped around his hips, her heels locked together as his hands held her under her knees, supporting her. Her arms were wrapped around his neck, and her tongue was down his throat. 

 Evan was surprised at how quickly he had succumbed. He had debated it for... only a second, it seemed, before he gave in, before his lips met Jade's in a fierce kiss. His attraction towards Jade, his urge to cheat, was too strong. They made out roughly in the porn shop, rolling against the walls as their hands were all over each other. Their lips only parted when Jade's co-worker entered and caught them in the act, rolling his eyes in annoyance at his slutty co-worker. Jade quickly clocked out, grabbed a few articles of slutty lingerie, stuffed them in her bag, and followed the married man out the door. 

 Jade was all over the married man as she guided him to her place, forcing Evan through unfamiliar territory on the bad side of town. They eventually reached her apartment building, and neither of them could keep their hands off the other as they entered. 

 Evan dropped the teen slut onto the bed and stepped back. The younger woman's striking green eyes stared up at him, legs spreading invitingly, exposing her creamy thighs. With only a moment's hesitance, Evan reached down and began to lift the hem of his shirt. He was soon bare-chested in front of this young slut, and she was an appreciative audience, eyeing his fit upper-half hungrily. Evan didn't pause for a second before beginning to undo his belt, not wanting to disappoint his slut. He let his slacks fall to the floor, leaving him clad only in his tight blue boxer-briefs, which clung to his engorged member. 

 "Wow." Jade marveled, seeing visual evidence of his size. "I definitely struck gold. I know I felt it before, but I didn't realize you were that big!" 

 "Uh, thanks." Evan replied. 

 "You don't have to be shy with me, Evan. I'm not your wife. I'm your whore. Your mistress. Your slut on the side. With me, you can be honest. Expose the real you. The side you can't ever let your wife see." Jade explained. Evan nodded. "Now, show me that married cock!" 

 Evan exhaled then lowered his briefs, letting them fall to the floor, showing off his throbbing married cock to a woman other than his wife for the first time ever. 

 "Whoa." Jade called out appreciatively as Evan's cock bobbed in front of her eyes. "That is the married cock of my dreams." she said before standing up. She stepped forward and took his bare cock in her smooth hand, causing him to jump slightly. "You really should have known this would happen. This is what happens when you wave a fat fucking cock in front of an innocent, impressionable 19- year-old." 

 "You are far from impressionable." Evan remarked. 

 "Ah!" she said, mock offended. "I'm just a simple, innocent teenage girl trying to make a living just innocently selling porn to an appreciative audience. But you saunter in and wave this fat fucking cock under my nose and you think I can just let that pass? Do you realize how fucking horny I am? I could practically smell that massive cock as soon as you came in. I could practically hear the cum sloshing around your sack. You were gagging to be taken, weren't you?" she asked, stroking his meat. 

 "God, yes." Evan moaned out, his attention being drawn toward his cock being pleasured. 

 "Your wife must be pretty dumb." Jade began. "Just dragging you around, trying to be all 'adventurous' and 'edgy' by going to a porn store. She didn't realize how plain she really is. She doesn't realize what a hunk you are, and that other women might want a taste. She didn't realize she was just showing you off, just begging for you to be taken from her. She didn't realize there are other women that won't show her any respect just cause you have a ring on your finger. She doesn't realize that other women won't play nice when there's good sex on the table. You realize this cock is mine now? It belongs to me. This fat dick, those heavy balls, all the cum filling it up, it's all for me now. Your wife got reckless and stupid, and now another woman owns her man's cock. If she was smart, she would just lock you up in your house and use you for her pleasure. I might have to do that... I have handcuffs in the dresser." Jade teased. 

 Evan's head fell back as the younger girl stroked him. He looked around the room. Her apartment in general looked fairly cheap, a lot of stuff looking like she got them second-hand. Her room had posters on the wall for bands, but the general décor was black. There definitely was a bit of forebodingness to this room. 

 Jade pulled him into a kiss, her soft lips meeting his. She slithered her tongue into his eager mouth, and as their tongues mashed together, he could feel her tongue stud against him. It was a new experience for the sheltered married man, to say the least. 

 She pulled him to the bed, curled into each other as they made out. Finally, Jade pushed him away, pushing the naked married man onto his back, his head at the foot of the bed. 

 "Close your eyes, baby." Jade purred, getting back on her feet. 

 The camera recording this scene was facing the foot of the bed, and in this position, Diana could only see the top of her husband's head. As Jade stood, her back faced the camera. Diana watched as the young woman let her skirt drop to the floor, exposing her thong clad ass to the camera. Each cheek was round and full, and her right ass-cheek had a tattoo of a snake's tooth, dripping with venom. She then lifted her tank top, exposing her bare back. She had a very large tattoo there as well, what appeared to be a pair of wings, adorning her entire back. And they weren't like bird's wings, or angel's wings. They looked more severe. They looked like devil wings. 

 As she lifted her top over her chest, her massive breasts plopped out, so large they were partly visible from behind her. Jade tossed the top aside and pulled her thong down, leaving her naked save for her fishnet stockings and leather boots. She was done stripping for now, so she joined Evan on the bed. She climbed over the nude married man, getting on all fours on top of him. 

 "Open up, baby, and see your destiny." Jade said as she curled her fingers around Evan's shaft again. Evan's eyes opened and looked straight up at the bare, tight pussy above him. He eyed the piercing on her clit, and the sight of something so raw drove him wild. His mouth watered as he stared at the juicy cunt hovering inches above him. Her scent hit his nose, and his body jerked in pleasure. As the girl began stroking his cock, Evan slid his hands up around her ass and pulled her down as his mouth dove up and surrounded her pussy with his open mouth. 

 "Aaaahh!" Jade moaned out, feeling the married man's tongue enter her dripping cunt. As the married man began to suck her pussy, she returned her favor, letting the married man's cock enter her hot mouth. 

 Diana watched in horror as she saw the back of the young girl's head bobbing as she sucked off her husband. And in the center of the screen, her husband was eating this young, trashy slut's pussy, his mouth really getting in there, clearly enjoying the taste of her. He never got that ferocious with his own wife, but with this little tramp, he dove right in. Diana didn't know if she could watch this slutty young girl riding her husband's face, her big, fleshy, round ass-cheeks bouncing, her asshole pointed directly at the camera. 

 Diana didn't see what her husband found so appealing. This young girl was so trashy! Sure, she had big tits and a round ass, but Diana was far more trim and fit than the curvy girl she was watching on the screen. Plus, she was adorned with all those slutty tattoos and piercings. But for some reason, her husband was loving it as he slurped the young girl's cunt. 

 Evan and Jade were lost for a few minutes, sucking at each other. Any thoughts of his wife had faded from Evan's mind as he sucked at Jade's needy cunt. It tasted so good! Evan couldn't get enough of her tasty sex juices. He was also spurred on by the young mouth inhaling his cock. 

 Jade was sucking him so well! Her lips were stretched around his meaty pole as she inhaled the married man's cock. Evan could feel her tongue-stud against his shaft, driving him wild with lust. It was so wrong, but it felt so right. She was sucking him better than Diana ever did. His wife never sucked him with such ferocity. Diana was like a beginner compared to this girl. It was amazing to him that this young 19-year-old could be so much better at sucking dick than his wife, a woman 10 years her senior. Jade bobbed deep on every suck, taking every inch of his thick weapon into her tight, wet throat. It was clear that Jade was a very experienced and talented whore. Her red hair was falling into his crotch, tickling his balls as she sucked him. 

 Diana was disgusted by these images on screen, but she couldn't look away. Those nasty DVDs her husband had been watching sprung to her mind. So many of these cheating husband porno's featured the husbands being caught fucking their slutty, busty mistresses. In those movies, the mistresses were always busty and hot and sexy and always seemingly pure evil, just dripping with malice, a trait the men seemed to find irresistible. They reveled in having the men betray their wives. It was like sport for them, almost. And when they were caught by the plain, boring wives, they would have no mercy. It wasn't enough for them to simply carry out affairs behind the wives' backs, letting the wife think all was well while the hubby secretly snuck off with his slut on the side and gave her his best. Even though, in a way, that was the more sinister outcome, these sluts had higher hopes. They wanted to steal the husbands right in front of the stupid wives. When caught, these sluts would carry on with the sex, berating and humiliating the wives, making them cry and crumble in front of them, only making the cheating sex even lustier and better. Sometimes, the sluts would force the wives to participate in the action, which usually amounted them making the wives suck their assholes while they continued fucking the married man. Sometimes, they would make the wife suck their massive breasts, sometimes they would make them rub or suck their clits. No matter what, the sluts would make the wives give pleasure to the woman who had stolen her man, in a way to fully supplant her superiority. 

 It was clear both Jade and Evan loved this porn. And Diana knew, if she had caught them in person, the scene would carry on like it did in the movies. Evan and Jade wouldn't stop. They would keep going. They would humiliate her. If Jade got the opportunity, she would no doubt make the slim wife suck her asshole. 

 Diana shivered in disgust. 

 After a few minutes, the cheating couple stopped sucking each other off. Jade lifted herself and was now putting a lot of her weight on Evan's face, smothering his face with her cunt and her round, fleshy ass. She ground herself into his face, moaning as she did so, before finally pulling herself away, Evan's mouth forced off her pussy with a smack. 

 "Alright, baby." Jade began. "You ready to officially cheat on your wife? Full- on, cock-in-another-woman's-cunt-while-your-wife-waits-at-home-like-a-dumbass cheating?" 

 Jade knee-crawled on the bed to spin around to face Evan and the camera, keeping one arm across her chest, preventing full view of her breasts. She reached down and grabbed his dick as she straddled him, pointing the married cock directly at her needy pussy. Evan's eyes were on the young slut's chest, waiting for her big boobs to be revealed. 

 "I asked you a question, babe." Jade purred, fingers digging into her own abundant breast flesh. "Are you ready to cheat? To live out your fantasy with your dream woman? You ready to break your marriage vows permanently?" she asked, preening slightly. 

 "Yes. YES! Please! I'm so ready!" Evan plead. "Please show me your breasts! I need to see them!" he begged. 

 "You want to see my tits?" Jade asked. 

 "Yes!" Evan affirmed. 

 "Are you sure? Cause these aren't the type of tits you forget about." Jade purred. "These jugs will dominate all your thoughts... your fantasies. It's too much take. There are just so big! Letting these breasts into your mind will force all thoughts of your wife out of your brain. All that silly love and loyalty to her will have to go. So, I'll ask you again, are you going to choose these 44EE tits over your boring, ugly wife?" Evan paused for a moment.  

 

 

===

"Yes." he relented. 

 "Say it like I did. Say you are choosing my tits over your boring, ugly, stupid wife." Jade ordered. 

 "I would rather have your tits than my boring, ugly, stupid wife." Evan repeated. Jade's plump lips curled into a smile, and she pulled her arm back, finally exposing her mammoth breasts to the married man. 

 Evan's eyes widened. He was in shock. Jade's breasts were just incredibly massive. Two round, smooth, creamy mounds of flesh, seemingly as big as fucking watermelons. Each pink nipple was round and smooth, and dangling from each nipple was a piercing. This vision was so raw and so sexy, Evan didn't know how to handle himself. Lust overcame him. 

 At the same instant that Jade lowered her needy pussy down over Evan's pulsing married cock, Evan lifted himself and attached his mouth onto one of the young slut's throbbing nipples. 

 "Aaaahhh!" Jade sighed with pleasure with the combination of the thick cock filling her wet pussy and the eager mouth beginning to suck her nipple. Evan's mouth formed a tight seal around the nub, sucking it, flicking his tongue over the hard nipple and the attached piercing. Jade spun her hips lightly, swirling the married cock inside of her. She wrapped her arms around the married man's head, squishing her breasts around his face, trying to smother him between her creamy breasts. Evan slid his hands up and cupped both of the fleshy jugs in his hands, digging his fingers into the mounds. 

 "Mmmmmm." Evan moaned from deep in his throat, the sensation of squeezing such massive breasts a deep-seeded pleasure he could not deny. He felt like a man, being able to squeeze tits this size. This was a pleasure he had been denied, kept away from for too long. His parents had kept him away from the pleasures of the flesh, and his wife had tried give him this type of pleasure in a very controlled manner. He had never had the chance to go out and take what he wanted, to indulge in those base, masculine needs, to experience something raw and filthy... until now. The pleasures of the flesh were in his hands, and he planned to indulge. He planned to let loose. 

 Evan slid his face against Jade's breasts, fully immersing himself in the softness. His hands were doing the same, squeezing her soft, fleshy orbs over and over again. He couldn't get enough of them, loving the sensation of the soft mounds pouring through his fingers. Evan's cock was equally indulging in this young slut's hot body, buried up to the balls in her tight, squeezing cunt. This was a new experience altogether. He was amazed again by Jade, amazed that such an obvious, blatant slut could have a cunt so much tighter than his wife's. His wife was no pure angel before she met him, but he had no doubt her history didn't compare to Jade's resume of men. And yet, Jade's cunt was so much tighter than Diana's pussy. Shouldn't it be the other way around? 

 Finally, Jade pushed him onto his back and dug her nails into his chest. He returned the favor, still squeezing at her melons. 

 "Alright baby, it's time to get the sex you would never get in married life." Jade boasted. Jade began to bounce on Evan, riding his married cock. 

 "Oh my God!" Evan moaned out. The sensation of Jade's tight cunt gripping his cock, smothering every inch with tightness and pleasure, it was a new experience. 

 "You like that?" Jade asked. "You like that fucking tight cunt around your married cock?" 

 "God yes!" he moaned out as she continued to bounce roughly on him. 

 "Better than your ugly wife's disgusting pussy?" Jade sneered. 

 "Yes! You're so much fucking tighter than her!" he admitted, gripping her tits roughly. 

 "Yes! Squeeze my fucking tits, baby! What a good fucking husband you are! You act all nice and good, but you go around and stare at all the pretty girls, gawk at their boobs, stare at their asses, and tell them how much tighter they are than your pathetic wife. Your wife loves you so much, but here you are, squeezing some nasty slut's huge boobs and saying such nasty things about her." Jade marveled. 

 "Fuck!" Evan groaned, driving up into her harder. 

 "Say it, baby. Talk like they do in the movies! Talk to me like a real, sexy fucking man cheating on his stupid, boring, ugly wife with the hottest bitch he could find!" Jade pled. 

 "Yes!" Evan moaned out. "I love it! You're so fucking sexy, Jade! Your body is insane! I love your tits!" he said, jiggling her boobs appreciatively in his hands. "I love your ass!" he said, sliding his hands down her sides, going around her body and squeezing both of her firm, round ass-cheeks firmly. "I love your tattoos. Your fucking piercings! I love it all!" 

 "You already love me, don't you Evan?" Jade asked, her huge tits bouncing in the married man's palms. "You already love me way more than you ever loved your stupid wife. Don't you? You fucking love the porn shop slut more than your plain, boring wife? Right? Admit it!" 

 "YES!" Evan groaned out, driving up into her, not sure if he really loved this young slut, but knowing for sure that saying it would drive him wild with lust. "Yes, I fucking love you, you little bitch! I love you more than I ever loved my disgusting wife! She's nothing compared to you. You, you nasty fucking slut, you're better than her in every fucking way!" 

 "Tell me! Tell me who owns this cock now! Tell me!" Jade demanded. 

 "You do!" Evan screamed out. "You own this fucking cock! It's your property! I married Diana, but my cock belongs to you! You can do whatever you want to it and I won't stop you!" 

 "FUCK!" Jade screamed out, bouncing on Evan harder. "I'm such a fucking whore! A whore for married men! God, I'm never fucking a single guy ever again! Married men need sluts like me! The only reason boring women can stay married is if their men have sluts like me to take care of them!" 

 The illicit lovers worked up a sweat as they fucked. Evan held his hands on Jade's ass, pulling her down into him as he drove up into her, squeezing the ripe, juicy cheeks firmly. And she drove that ass into him, fucking him into submission, using her ass like the weapon it was. 

 "I want to do it all, baby!" Evan groaned out. "I want to fucking do it all with you! Only you!" 

 "Oh baby, we will! We fucking will!" Jade moaned out, bouncing on the married dick. "I'll be your fucking slut! You can have me in any hole at any time! I'll do whatever you want! We'll do all the fun stuff, and we'll leave all the boring, dull shit to that fucking wife of yours. Cause that's what wives like her deserve." 

 "Yes!" Evan said, driving up into her hard, looking and acting more like an alpha male than he ever had before. "I want to make all your nasty fantasies come true!" 

 "Babe, that's a long fucking list! Fuck yes!" Jade screamed. "You are so hot! My perfect, fantasy married man. We're gonna do it all! We're gonna fuck every day behind your wife's back! You're gonna fuck my mouth, my cunt, my ass, my tits! We're gonna fuck in your marital bed whenever we get the chance! I want your sheets soaked with my sweat and cum when your wife sleeps on it! I want her to smell me every fucking night. I want to put my sweaty ass on her pillow when you fuck me! I want your wife to catch us! I want her to catch me juicing your cock for every drop of cum! When she sees the young, pierced, tattooed up slut fucking her husband better than she ever could, her heart will break, and her tears will make me cum! When she's a slobbering, blubbering mess, I'll grab her head, pull her in close, and smother her fucking ugly face with my ass!" 

 "Oh my God!" Evan grunted out, driving up into the young slut harder. 

 "Yes! Fuck yes!" Jade screamed out. "Yes! I'll grab her by her ratty hair, pull her in rough, and just scrub my sweaty ass all over her disgusting face! I'll slide my ass-crack all over her nasty face while I ride you. She'll never forget the taste and smell of my ass! I'll make her kiss my asshole, make her suck it, make her rim me, GOD YES!" Jade squealed. Evan drove up into her roughly, loving the filth she could come up with. "Pound me, Evan! Pound me! Pound my hot body with your fat cock! You like that? You like the thought of this 19-year-old slut making your wife her ass slave?" 

 "GOD! FUCK YES!" Evan grunted out, pulling Jade down hard, his lips meeting hers as they kept fucking hard, driving into each other roughly. Her breasts jiggled against Evan's fit chest. Jade turned her head to the side, her lips moving close to the married man's ear. 

 "I'm close, baby." Jade whispered. "Make me cum! Make your little whore cum!" 

 "I'm gonna cum, too!" Evan groaned out, still aiding the little slut bouncing on him. 

 "Do it inside me, babe." Jade gasped out. "Cum in me! Make me your little pregnant whore! Evan, I love you, and I want to have all your babies! So do it! Fill me with all that hot, sticky cum! Give me all the sperm in your balls! Give me all the babies that were supposed to belong to your stupid fucking wife! This cock won't truly be mine till you do! The only way this fucking fantasy can end is with you knocking me up! So do it! Do it! Give me your cum! I want it so bad!" the young slut begged. 

 "Fuck yes!" Evan screamed out. "I want it! I want you to have all my babies! I don't want my ugly wife to have any! You're so much better than her, you deserve it all!" 

 "I'm gonna cum, baby! I'm gonna cum! Make your little tattooed slut cum! Make my cunt quiver, baby! Oh my God! OH MY GOD! OH GOD! OH GOD! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! YES! YES! YES! YYYYYEEEEESSSSSSS! FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK YYYYYYYEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS!" Jade screamed at the top of her lungs as she came, her cunt locking around Evan's pulsing married shaft. 

 "UUUUHHHHH GGGOOOODDDD YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!" Evan grunted, his voice strained as his balls twisted in climax, cum firing from his sack into the tight young slut on top of him. Their bodies writhed together in pleasure as the married man came inside his new slut. 

 Diana was disgusted. Horrified, disgusted, revolted, appalled. Her life had just fallen apart in front of her eyes. Her husband had cheated on her with a scheming slut, who had designs to destroy and humiliate Diana. Evan had agreed to this sick filth, going along with it, taking pleasure in the idea of taking part in it. 

 Diana wanted to look away, but part of her couldn't help but keep watching. She knew she had to see this. She had to know how far her husband had fallen. She kept watching as her husband and the little slut's lips met in soft kisses as they came down from their highs. Something so intimate, after something so brutally sexual. It was jarring. 

 Diana was shaken from her reverie by the phone ringing. She finally pulled her eyes away from the screen and picked up the bedside phone. 

 "Um, hello?" Diana asked, her voice cracking. 

 "Uh, hi, this is Paul Shoemaker, is this Diana?" a voice asked. 

 "Uh, yes." Diana confirmed. 

 "Hi, Diana, I work with your husband. I'm calling because we've been trying to get ahold of him. I know he took a sick day, but we've been trying to call him on his cell, and he didn't reply, and we finally found someone who knew his home number, so we're wondering if he was there so we could talk?" Paul asked. 

 "Uh..." Diana began. A sick day? He took a sick day? He had left this morning like he was going to work like normal. Then, it hit her. He was with Jade. He had spent his morning with her. That would explain why Jade was so disheveled when she came in. They had been doing it again this morning. Evan clearly felt no guilt after their first encounter, and they had kept going at it again. 

 "Mrs. Prentiss?" Paul asked. 

 "Oh... he's not here." Diana said, hanging up, nearly catatonic. Her eyes were on the screen. Jade was now on all-fours, facing the camera, and Evan's face was buried between her full, round ass cheeks. Jade looked back at him and spoke up. 

 "Oh, Evan, you are so fucking good. Keep rimming my asshole. Yes! God, I love you. You are so fucking perfect. Babe, we will be fucking for a long, long time. I have so much more to teach you. To show you. You could be something special with me. And, plus, you think you've seen some real nasty porno? You should see my collection. The nastiest fucking shit you could find. All of it with men cheating on their wives. I even got some home-made stuff, true tales of men actually having the balls to cheat on their wives in the awesomest ways possible. Just wait till you see them. You'll get some good ideas." Jade boasted. Evan kept sucking her ass lovingly. 

 Diana was frozen in place. She watched her husband get behind Jade, his face rising above the edge of screen, disappearing behind it. Now, he was just another man, some guy with a slut in his bed. He put his cock in place, and pushed it into her tight ass. Diana's focus was on the slut on all fours, facing the camera. Jade grimaced slightly before her face softened into a look of pleasure. Evan began fucking her ass in earnest, and Diana couldn't stop watching. Jade's eyes were staring straight at the camera, as if she knew Diana would be watching. Diana was. She watched this trashy young slut, on all fours, her massive, creamy udders hanging below her, grazing the bed. And Jade's eyes, her fierce, striking green eyes just stared at her, smug in their superiority, smug knowing that Diana's husband was hers now. He was now for her pleasure alone, willing to play her sick games. There was malice behind that glare, a look that said that if Jade had her way, Diana would be behind the bent-over slut, worshipping her asshole with her tongue. 

 Diana hoped it would never come to that. 

 A depth of depravity she didn't know he had had been brought out of Evan, not only by Jade, but also by that sick porn Diana herself had brought into the house. Diana had started them down this slippery slope, and that had led his cock to another woman's tighter, better cunt. Diana knew she had had a good thing with Evan, and due to her lust for slightly better sex, she had lost everything. She had inadvertently sent Evan down a new path with another woman. She had blown it big time. And now her husband's cock was in the ass of another woman, giving him more pleasure than he had ever had. 

 Diana had been the one that did all the heavy lifting. She had taken him from a shy young man to a loving husband. She had done the hard work to unearth the stud underneath, and just at the point that that stud emerged, another woman had swooped in and taken the prize. At the last possible moment, that bitch Jade took over and was given all the orgasms Evan the stud was supposed to give to his wife. Diana had done the work and got none of the pleasure. Evan the stud had emerged, and someone else was reaping the benefits. 

 Sadly, this was almost the preferable option for Diana. She almost hoped that it was her work that had led to this, since the idea of that little whore doing in one night what Diana had failed to do in ten years filled her with an even greater sense of inadequacy. She was already feeling inadequate already. Jade was younger, with much larger tits, a hotter, rounder ass, and apparently, a tighter, wetter cunt. Diana suddenly felt flat, inadequate, and less of a woman than Jade. And if you find out your husband prefers a 19-year-old slut who works at a porn shop as opposed to his sweet, nice, pretty wife, inadequacy is all you can feel. 

 Diana finally turned off the DVD, not wanting to watch any more of her husband fucking another girl up the ass. And it was just in time, as minutes later, Evan walked in, wearing his work clothes. Diana was frozen, not sure what to expect. But Evan acted like normal, smiling at his wife. 

 "Hi." Diana said, unsure what to say. 

 "Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. Work was crazy." Evan said effortlessly, coming over to give his wife a peck on the lips. Diana sensed a strange taste on his lips, but Evan gave no indication that anything was off. "I'm all sweaty, I'm gonna take a shower." Evan said, walking off. 

 Diana was stunned. He was lying, she knew that, but he was so good at it. His lies sounded true. Diana's heart dropped. She had taken pride in the fact that she had brought Evan out of his shell. But now, he had gone too far, too out of his shell, beyond what Diana could give him. She had trained him too well, and now, he had stepped out on her. He was cheating on her and lying to her easily about it, things she would have never thought he was capable of. 

 It was at this point that Diana realized she didn't really know her husband at all.

Once again, I wanted to put out the call for any and all story ideas for stories in this genre, with either fresh characters or characters from my other stories. So, thanks for reading, and thanks for sticking with my stories.) Report_Story
