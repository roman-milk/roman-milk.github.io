Ada's Cuckold

"Jerry?" 

 "Yes dear?" "Would you come in here please?" 

 "Yes dear, right away." 

 I hit the stop button on the remote to stop the movie I was watching and then went upstairs to the bedroom. My wife Ada was lying on her side fondling the cock of the black man lying next to her. 

 "Roy has just finished some very energetic fucking and he is thirsty. Would you please get him something to drink?" 

 "Yes dear. What would you like Ray?" 

 "Just water would be fine." 

 "With ice?" 

 "No, that won't be necessary." 

 "Okay, one glass of water coming up" and I headed for the bathroom. 

 As I headed for the bathroom I pondered, and not for the first time, what it was that causes human beings to do the things they do. What was it that caused people to do things so far out of line with their character? Here I was, a man who considered himself a 'manly man' and I was running around saying "Yes dear" to my wife and waiting hand and foot on the smirking black asshole who was fucking her. Is this where I expected to be when Ada and I married? Hell no! So why was I smiling and doing things that went so far against my basic nature? What was the thing that caused me to be everything that I didn't want to be? Well, in my case it was greed. Pure unadulterated greed. 

 I had married Ada for her money. Ada had married extremely well when she had finished college and ten years later when her husband was killed in an auto accident Ada found herself very, very wealthy. She was a great looking lady and very sexy, but make no mistake - I'd have gone after her if she was as homely as hell and as fat as a pig. She had money and I had been dirt poor all my life and I would not have let a little thing like looks get in the way. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had graduated from college with a degree in Business Management and had gone to work, but I wasn't making the kind of money I wanted fast enough. I'd made it to college on scholarships, but it had still taken student loans to help get me through and what with living expenses and paying back those loans I never seemed to have much left. I was out looking for ways to augment my income and a friend suggested that I might be able to make a few bucks as a club fighter. I had done pretty well for myself in Golden Gloves competition and I found that I could get two, maybe three fights a week. I knew that I wasn't good enough to ever make it to the main event, but I could do all right in the three, five and seven round pre-lims. It was at one of those pre-lims that I met Ada. She was in the front row with several of her girlfriends the night I fought Ripper Washington. I found out later that she was there on a dare. Anyway, I happened to look down at her and saw her looking up at me, I winked and gave her a thumbs up and she laughed, waved and gave me a big smile. 

 Ripper was a big black dude, built like a tank, and the book on him was that he was a plodder. No fancy footwork, just walk into you and wear you down until you were too tired and then he'd nail you. The bell rang for the first round and I danced out and met Ripper in the middle of the ring and my first punch was a left jab that skipped past his guard and hit him dead on the chin. It was a lucky punch and I knew it, but it was a lucky punch that dazed him enough to cause him to drop his guard and a right cross put him down for the count (I met him six months later in a five round pre-lim and he damn near killed me). I danced around the ring with my hands in the air and I saw Ada jumping up and down cheering. An hour later when I came out of the dressing rooms I found her waiting for me (again, on a dare) and I asked her to join me for a cup of coffee. She accepted and soon we were dating and we seemed to get along good together. Then I found out she was rich and I put on a full court press. Nine months later we were married and settled down to live happily ever after. 

 Happily ever after turned out to be two years, four months and eighteen days. I came home one night to find Ada dressing to go out. 

 "We going somewhere?" 

 "Not we, just me" she said as she rolled on her nylons and clipped them to her garter belt. 

 "What's the occasion?" 

 "I need a change," she said as she slipped on a pair of black CFMs. 

 "A change from what?" 

 As she slid into a little black cocktail dress she said, "We've been married for what, almost two and a half years now?" 

 "Yeah, about that." 

 "Well I think it is time for me to sample another cock." 

 "You what?" 

 "I'm going out looking for some strange tonight. If I find something I like I'll probably bring him home with me so you will have to sleep in one of the spare bedrooms tonight." She looked over at me and said, "Close your mouth dear, before you catch flies. Don't worry dear, I'm not leaving you. I'm happy with our marriage and I'm happy with you, but I want to fuck another man tonight. Don't wait up and don't forget to sleep in one of the spare bedrooms." 

 

 She turned and walked out of the room, down the stairs and out into the attached garage and minutes later her BMW went down the drive while I stood stunned in the bedroom. 

 Even though she had told me to not wait up I was up when she came home. How the hell did she expect me to be able to sleep after the bomb she laid on me? I heard the garage door opener start to run and I looked out the window to see her BMW coming up the drive followed by another car. I was standing in the kitchen when Ada came through the connecting door from the garage. She saw me standing there and shrugged her shoulders, "It would have been better for you, ego wise, had you been in the spare bedroom just now, but if you want it this way so be it." She started for the front door and then she stopped and turned to me. 

 "Your position in this house and in this marriage is safe as long as you don't do anything stupid. When I let Dave in I will introduce you and you will smile and shake his hand and then you can come up and watch for all I care. If you can't handle this, or if you make a scene, you can pack your bags and get out and my lawyers will be in touch, understand?" 

 I just stood there, not understanding what was happening and she said with a touch of steel in her voice, "I said do you understand?" 

 I numbly shook my head yes. 

 "Good. Now either get ready to meet Dave or run along up to a spare bedroom." 

 I don't know why I tagged along behind her; I suppose it was because I didn't really believe it was happening, maybe it was some sort of joke or some kind of test or something. I was standing three feet from Ada when she opened the door and let the man in. I was surprised to see that he was black. 

 "Dave, this is my husband Jerry. Jerry, this is Dave and he will be taking your place in our bed tonight." 

 Dave gave me a goofy grin and stuck out his hand and I numbly took it and shook it. 

 "As long as you are up dear would you make us a couple of drinks and bring them up to the bedroom please? I'll have my usual and Dave drinks scotch on the rocks, Dewars if we have it. Come along Dave and I'll show you the playroom" and the two of them walked away and left me standing there. 

 I was seething. I wanted to break something. I wanted to smash Dave in the mouth. I wanted to take a belt and beat Ada's ass bloody. Those are the things I wanted to do, but what I did was make the drinks, put them on a try and carry them upstairs. Dave was sitting on the edge of the bed with his trousers down around his ankles and Ada was kneeling in front of him sucking his worthless black cock. When I walked into the room Ada took her mouth off of him long enough to say, "Set the drinks on the bedside stand and then run along dear. I'll see you in the morning." 

 I'd been dismissed and had been told to get out. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had a lot on my mind as I walked away from what was supposed to be my bedroom to one of the spare bedrooms. Chief among my thoughts was what was I going to do about my new situation. I knew the answer to that before the question was fully formed. Nothing. I would do nothing. I would do absolutely nothing except smile and bear it. Ada controlled the purse strings and she kept a very tight grip on them. I couldn't complain because Ada denied me nothing. If I wanted it, I got it. I wanted a house with grounds, a swimming pool and a tennis court so Ada went out, found it and bought it. I wanted a Corvette so Ada went out and bought me one. Country club membership? No problem. A week in Aspen? Mention it and the tickets would be on the desk in my den when I got home from work and the reservations at the lodge would be already made. I lacked for nothing. Ada showered me with jewelry, clothes, sports gear and she even saw to it that the balance in my checking account never fell below five grand. And that didn't even count my own paycheck. I actually tried to give it Ada to add to the 'household account' but she wouldn't take it. 

 "Put it in savings Jerry, or invest it. You made it, you keep it." 

 She spoiled me rotten, but she wasn't stupid. I had to sign a prenuptial agreement before we got married. If I divorced her I got nothing. If she divorced me before the marriage was ten years in existence I got a lump sum settlement of one hundred grand. After ten years I got an additional twenty grand for each year exceeding ten. No, Ada could rub my face in an awful lot and I'd still smile and take it. I didn't understand it, but I would take it. 

 The reason I didn't understand it was because Ada and I had what I considered to be a pretty damned good sex life. Every night of the week was not uncommon although the actual average was probably only five nights a week and we did it all. She liked to be eaten and I liked eating her. She gave fantastic head and loved anal sex. In addition I really did love Ada. I know that it was her money that caused me to go after her, but I was very fond of her by our wedding and it grew into love. What had gone wrong? I probably should have picked a room father away from what used to be my bedroom because all I heard for the next several hours were the yells, moans and cries that Ada used to make with me. I finally fell asleep, but it was a very fitful sleep. I woke up when I heard a car door slam and I got up and looked out the window and saw Dave's car backing out of the drive. I looked over at the clock and saw that it was four in the morning. I debated going back to my bedroom to try and talk to Ada, but then I said, "Fuck it!" and went back to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The morning brought another surprise. I don't know what I expected when I woke up, but it certainly wasn't Ada climbing into bed with me and going down on me as though the previous night hadn't happened. When she got me hard she climbed on top and slid down my pole and I felt Dave. She hadn't cleaned herself before coming to me and I wondered if it was another way of rubbing my nose in her infidelity. As if reading my mind she said, "Can you feel him Jerry? Can you feel what Dave left in me? Do you like the feeling of soaking your cock in a black man's juices? He fucked me five times Jerry, five marvelous times. But you know what Jerry? As good as he was you are still my man. You are going to be sharing me a lot from now on, but you are still my man." She rolled off me and pulled at me, "Come on Jerry, climb in the saddle and fuck me. Do me hard baby, do me hard." 

 I didn't say a word to Ada. I fucked her, finished, got out of bed and took a shower to wash the cum and sweat off me and then I did my daily twenty-five laps in the pool. That done I went into the house and put on the coffee pot and I was sitting at the table drinking coffee and reading the morning paper when Ada came into the kitchen. I ignored her and after several minutes of silence she said, "You are a grown man Jerry. It doesn't suit you to act like an upset little kid." 

 "Upset doesn't cover it Ada. I don't have anything to say right now. I'm keeping my mouth shut until you see fit to explain what game it is that you are playing." 

 "No game Jerry, I've just decided that I want to fuck other men from now on. You don't have to put up with it if you don't want to. Just pack and leave, but I meant what I said, you are still my main man if you want to be. You just have to get used to sharing me." 

 "That's it? Get used to sharing you or get out?" 

 "That's it in a nutshell Jerry." 

 Share her I did, but I never got used to it. Over the course of the next six months, on an average of twice a week Ada would tell me to sleep in a spare bedroom while she entertained in our bedroom. I never understood why, but the men she always brought home were black. The first couple of times I made sure that I was in the spare bedroom when she got home with her stud of the evening. The next morning she would crawl in bed with me and describe her evening as she slid up and down on my dick and when she had finished telling me all about it she would roll over and pull me on top of her and tell me to fuck her hard. Then I guess she decided that she wasn't rubbing my nose in her infidelities hard enough. She started telling me to wait up for her, that she wanted me to meet her lovers and from there it went to having me wait on them, bring them drinks and snacks and in one case she even sent one of them to me to ask if he could borrow one of my condoms. I half expected Ada to tell me to roll it on him, but I was spared that indignity. A dozen times I almost told Ada to kiss my ass, but then I would look out the window at the swimming pool and the tennis courts and I would think of all the material things that Ada provided and I would get my anger in check and just go on being the good cuckolded husband. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I got the glass of water and carried it back into the bedroom and as I handed it to the smirking black asshole something inside me just snapped. It was like a switch had been thrown and all of a sudden everything was different - totally different. I'd like to say that I stuffed the glass down the black asshole's throat, but I didn't. I handed it to him and he said, "Thank you" and I said, "You're welcome" and I left the room. 

 I wasn't in the spare bedroom in the morning. In fact, I wasn't even in the house. I came home at five in the afternoon to a very angry Ada. 

 "Where in the hell have you been?" 

 "Out taking care of business." 

 "What kind of business?" 

 "Well, let's just see what we have in here" and I opened my briefcase. I took out some papers and started handing them to her. "Here is the check for the last five thousand that you put in my checking account. Do you know that they got upset when I closed the account? They actually asked me if you were aware that I was doing it. Here is the title to the Corvette. I've signed off on the back of it. Maybe you can give it to last night's lover. He looks like the kind of guy who could be happy in a Vette." 

 I rummaged around in my briefcase, "Let's see what else I have in here. Oh here, these are for you" and I took out a key ring. One by one I took them off the ring and laid them down on the table as I said, "The key to the house, the keys to the Vette, this one is to my locker at the country club. The clubs you gave me for my birthday are inside of it and I'm sure that one of your lovers would like to have them. Last, but by all means least, as you have shown me over the last six months, is this." I slid my wedding ring off my finger and tossed it on the table. There was a honking from out front and I said, "My cab is here. I'll drop you a line when I find a place to stay so you will know where to send the papers." 

 I got up and headed for the door as Ada screamed at me, "Jerry, you get back here. You get back here right this minute." 

 I ignored her and then I was out the front door and gone. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was halfway through the third round when the right staggered me and I went to my knees. I was up by the seven count which, on reflection, was a very bad move on my part. I was still seeing double when he moved in on me and I never saw the punch that knocked me out. I came to in the dressing room and I thought I heard a familiar voice ask, "Will he be all right?" 

 "He should be fine. Some double vision for a while and maybe a little nausea, but no other harmful effects." 

 "Thank God. I was afraid from the way he went down that he was hurt really bad." 

 A chuckle and then, "It's the price he pays for the fun he has." 

 "When can I take him home?" 

 "I thought he lived alone?" 

 "Not anymore, not if I can help it." 

 It slowly got through to me that the voice was Ada's. What was she doing here? I'd put her out of my life six months ago. The whiff of the smelling salts being passed under my nose almost brought me up to a sitting position and I looked around the room and saw Doc Jeffers and Ada. 

 "You really ought to give this up Jerry" Doc said, "You are just a bit past your prime." 

 "Got to pay the rent Doc." 

 "Whatever. I'll be going now. No fights for two weeks and I really wish you wouldn't have any more at all." 

 As the door closed him I looked at Ada and said, "What are you doing here?" 

 "I've come to take you home." 

 "How you going to do that? You don't even know where I live." 

 "Of course I do. I sit out in front of the place every night trying to work up the courage to walk up and ring your doorbell." 

 "What? It takes more guts to ring a doorbell than to drag men in front of me and then fuck them?" 

 She looked away from me and in a timid voice said, "Yes, yes it does." 

 "Why do you want to ring my doorbell in the first place?" 

 "So I can talk to you. So I can try and get you to come back home." 

 "That whorehouse (and I put a lot of emphasis on 'whorehouse') is not my home." 

 

 "Then we'll sell it and buy another." 

 "Go away Ada. I put you out of my life. It's been six months now and I've managed to get along just fine." 

 "I haven't." 

 "You haven't what?" 

 "Managed to get along just fine. I haven't slept well since you left. I'm having trouble eating and my nerves are a mess." 

 "Sex is supposed to help all those things and you were dragging plenty of that home with you as I recall." 

 "There hasn't been a man in my life since the day you left." 

 I'm sure that my facial expression said, "Yeah, right!" 

 "I mean it Jerry. There hasn't been a man in my life since that day you walked out on me and you were the only man in my life when you were there." 

 I laughed out loud when I heard that one and she said, "No Jerry, seriously. You were the only man in my life, the others were just tools." 

 "Tools?" 

 "Yes. All they were were things I used because I was stupid." 

 "You lost me there." 

 "I got to thinking that you didn't love me and that you only married me for my money. I thought about it so much that I convinced myself that I needed to find out. So I decided to do something that would show me one way or the other. I decided that I had to do something so way out that you would have to do something about it if you loved me. If you didn't love me and were only with me for my money you would just turn your back on it and let me get away with it rather than risk a fight that would end our relationship. You were supposed to throw Dave out on his ass that first time, either that or grab your clothes and leave, but you were not supposed to let me get away with it. When you let me take Dave to our bedroom it broke my heart. When you let him fuck me and you were still there the next day I knew that you didn't love me, only my money. 

 "After Dave the others were just my way of showing you how disgusted I was with you and I even made sure that all of them were black to piss you off more. Then you left me and I found out something that I hadn't realized. I found out that it didn't matter if you didn't love me and only wanted me for my money, for what I had. I found out that I loved you and couldn't live without you. Since you walked out I've been a mess. I spend all my time following you around. I've been here for every one of your fights sitting in the back where you couldn't see me. I sit outside your apartment. I even rented an office across the street from yours and from my office window I can look down into yours and I sit there and watch you all day long. I can't live without you Jerry. I don't care if you don't really love me, I need you Jerry, I need you."  

 

 

===

I'm not totally stupid and even though it wasn't true I knew what to say, "I didn't stay through all of that shit for your money Ada. I stayed because I loved you and I hoped that whatever it was that you were doing would work it's way out of your system. I finally couldn't take it anymore. It was obvious that you didn't love me or you couldn't have done to me what you did so I did the only thing I could do and I left and I don't see any reason for me to even be talking to you now. You made your bed Ada, go lie in it and leave me alone." 

 "Please Jerry, please. We can work it out, I know we can. Please Jerry, please come home with me." 

 There was no question that I was going to let myself be persuaded, but I wanted to be a little mean and do some nose rubbing of my own. If she didn't go for it I could back off, but I wanted to see just how desperate she was to have me back. "You hurt me Ada. You have no idea what it did to me to be put through what you put me through. I can't see getting back together with you without giving you a taste of what you did to me. Who is your best girlfriend?" 

 "I suppose that it would be Linda Meyer." 

 "Is she the sexy looking redhead whose husband is the dentist?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Okay Ada, here's the deal. I want you to bring Linda into our bedroom just the way you brought all those men. Then I want you to stand there and watch me fuck Linda just like I had to stand there and watch you fuck all those black assholes. I want you to serve Linda and me snacks and drinks just like you had me do. I'm not going to fuck as many women as you did men, but I am going to do the one." 

 "I can't do that! She's happily married and has three kids." 

 "I don't give a shit Ada. You want me and I want revenge. Make it happen or get used to me not being around. Until then, just leave me alone." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That was two weeks ago and I honestly didn't expect that it would happen, but I wanted to make Ada sweat and suffer a little. I expected her to come back in a week or two and tell me that it just couldn't be done and then do some more begging and pleading. 

 Ada just called me: 

 "You can come home tonight Jerry. Linda will be here at seven, but there is a slight complication." She would only agree to do it if would agree to spend a night with her husband next week." 

 "So what's the problem?" 

 "I'm your wife Jerry. I'm trying to put us back together again. How can I do that if I'm having sex with another man?" 

 "Ada, you were a cock sucking whore for six months so just what is one more cock to you?" 

 There was silence on the other end of the line and then, "Tell me to do it Jerry. If you tell me to do it I won't be cheating on you." 

 "How can you cheat on me when we aren't even together Ada? I told you what you had to do to get me to even consider coming back to you. You make up your mind Ada and then you let me know" and I hung up on her. 

 She called me back in ten minutes, "All right Jerry, I'll fuck him, just come home tonight baby, please just come home." 

 "Look on the bright side Ada, at least you'll be fucking a white man for a change" and I burst out laughing as I hung up the phone. Report_Story
