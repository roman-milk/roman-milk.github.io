Two Teachers

"Where are you off to tonight," Adele asked her friend. 

 "Nowhere really," Silvia replied. 

 Adele looked at her friend, wondering why she was avoiding the casual question. Silvia had tried to keep out of the way, from when Adele got back to the apartment. She was in the middle of applying make-up, and had her hair in pigtails, which was unusual. She had been looking at the wall clock so often, it was clear she was on her way out somewhere. 

 Knowing her friend so well, Adel could see she was nervous. "Come on, out with it. You know I can get it out of you, so just tell me, without the protest. What have you done this time? What's up?" Adele demanded. 

 "I'm not in trouble! All right, I'll tell you, just don't shout at me. I got caught shoplifting," Silvia murmured. "Stop laughing! It's not funny!" she complained. She explained there was a silk scarf, on special offer, but she had forgotten her credit cards. It didn't help quell the laughter. 

 "I can't believe miss perfect, stole something. So what's that got to do with you going out?" Adele asked. 

 "The guy said he would cover up for me, if I went out with him," she said, putting on a sulky face. 

 "Is this security guy some old pervert?" Adele giggled. 

 "No. He's eighteen," Sylvia sighed. 

 "You're twenty-six, you can't go out with a kid," Adele laughed. 

 "I've no choice," Sylvia said, in exasperation at her friend's flippancy. 

 "Just phone him and tell him it's off. Call his bluff," Adele urged. 

 "I daren't. If I'm prosecuted, I'll lose my job!" Sylvia protested. "He said he'd get the security tape and destroy it, if I go out on a date," she huffed. "He was working at his uncle's store, for work experience. You know the one, on the corner of Elm," she said. 

 "Shit! I know from the kids at school, they always prosecute," Adele told her. 

 "Thanks! That makes me feel so much better," she said, pouting. 

 "You're a teacher, how do you get into these stupid situations?" Adele asked, knowing the answer, only too well. Her friend was an intelligent and attractive woman, yet she had little common sense. She was also a push over, so needed help, or the trouble would get worse. 

 "When he arrives, we'll knock him on the head, and bury him in the garden," Adele told her. 

 "Kill him! Over a silk scarf?" Sylvia exclaimed, in mock surprise. 

 "Who said anything about killing the damn shit? We'll bury him alive," Adele chuckled. 

 "Thanks for that input. Just go and let me get changed. I'll just have to get it over and done with, and that will be the end of it," Sylvia heavily sighed. 

 "I know you too well. You'll just let him walk all over you. I'm coming along to look after you," Adele told her. She took a firm hold of an arm, leading her to her bedroom. 

 "Are you actually going to wear that?" Adele laughed. 

 "It's from the store. That's what he wanted," Sylvia murmured. 

 "The dress is fine, if you were a teenager, but you're not. The pigtails are so you!" Adele mocked her friend. 

 "Its part of the deal," Sylvia shrugged. "He's a teenager after all," she added. Sylvia pulled on the flowery summer dress, and pulled a face at her friend. 

 "Wow! You look good. He has taste, you sure he's only eighteen?" Adele asked. 

 "Try the other one on," Sylvia said. 

 "No way! I'm going like this," Adele retorted. She hadn't changed from school yet, so it was just a tease. She was dressing older, to impress the school board, while trying for a more senior post at the school. 

 "If you're going to chaperone then you better wear it. We're the same size. Besides, we're just going to hang out with his friends, so you can't go dressed in a business suit," Sylvia stated. 

 Adele picked the dress up between finger tips, as though it might be contagious. Pulling it on, she smoothed it down her slim body, while looking in the mirror. The dress was a pastel blue, decorated with butterflies. 

 "It's cute, expensive too. I would have loved this, a few years ago," Adele commented. She liked it, so didn't complain too much. "OK! I'm not fixing my hair into pigtails, this is the limit," she added. 

 "I need a drink, you too. It'll steady your nerves," Adele suggested. 

 The guy was only eighteen, so the two of them could handle the audacious blackmailer. Adele was going to make sure there was a security tape, and force him to hand it over. They both taught at the same school, so she knew how sensitive the school board was. Sylvia was right about losing her job, if prosecuted for theft. 

 They waited for him to turn up, hoping he wouldn't have the gall to go through with it. They giggle like schoolgirls on a first date, primping each others hair, and flouncing around in the new dresses. Adele had at least put her friend in a better mood. 

 The guy didn't even bother coming to the front door, he just honked the horn. 

 "Don't forget, put him at his ease. We're just a couple of silly young girls, out on a date. I'll keep an eye on him, you just relax," Adele coached her. At the right moment, when he was off-guard, she would hit him hard. She would treat him like a student, lecturing him like a delinquent kid, to get the tape. 

 He just sat there while they got into the car. "What's she doing here?" James suspiciously asked. 

 "My name is Adele. I'm here because we thought you might like to show off two young girls," Adele countered, giving him something to think about. 

 It worked, because he pulled away, with a big grin on his face. He kept looking in the mirror at them, with a smile lighting his face. He had two beautiful women in his car, for the price of one. 

 The over confidence of the young lout, meant they had a chance of denting his ego, big time. Once he was vulnerable, she would get what she wanted. Having primed Sylvia to play good cop, she could sit back, and wait for the right moment. 

 Before Adele could ask where they were going, he pulled into a driveway, running up to a large, impressive house. 

 "We'll stop off at my parents and I'll get changed," he said. 

 Looking at each other, they exchanged shrugs. This was unexpected, so maybe it wouldn't be such an ordeal after all. They had expected the dire prospect of being shown off to his friends, by a nerdy guy, unable to get a girlfriend without blackmailing her. 

 In the light of the hallway Adele got a good look at him. He was tall and muscular, not what she expected at all. He had a nice bottom too. She looked at her friend, wondering if it was just the blackmail that influenced her, to go along with his plans. If he had been a lot older, he would have been boyfriend material. 

 It was embarrassing meeting his mother in the kitchen. Sylvia could just about get away with looking like a teenager, with her fresh faced looks. They were both slim and short, so looked younger than their twenty-six years. Adele kept her head down, trying not to reveal her face. 

 In the dining room, on their way to his room, Adele took hold of his arm. "I want to know if there really is a security tape," she hissed at him. He may be on home territory, but his mom was close by, so he wouldn't want to make a fuss. 

 "There is, for sure. My uncle is red hot on security, there are cameras everywhere. To get it back you both have to keep me happy," he smiled. 

 It was too much for Adele. "Blackmail is nasty, and that makes you a nasty shit. You'll give it to me, or I'll damn well tell your parents. You're just an obnoxious bastard, an arrogant fucking shit," Adele told him, with an angry force spilling from her. 

 "What do you think you are doing? Talking to my son like that, in my home, using such foul language?" his mother interrupted. "Well? What have you got to say for yourself, young girl," she asked. With hands on her hips, she was standing to her full height, looming over Adele, looking powerful and mean. 

 Adele shrank down into herself. This was unnatural for her, for she could stick up for herself. Not wanting to be discovered, as a mature adult, she let the woman think she was just a friend of her sons. From the woman's fierceness, and from being embarrassed, she capitulated. 

 "Sorry," she mumbled, sounding like an adolescent. 

 "I'll get my husband to take you home, and he can tell your parents. He's head of the high school board, therefore he knows how to treat young miscreants, like you," the woman lectured. 

 Adele wanted to laugh from shock. It was she who had made the whole situation worse, not Sylvia. If they found out she was a teacher, at the high school, it was she who would be fired. The woman reminded her, of a no-nonsense teacher they had in senior year. The tone of voice alone left her feeling like a naughty school girl, rather than a teacher. 

 "Please, miss, don't tell your husband. I don't want to be expelled," Adele lied, without looking at her. 

 ""Young people are so rude, I'm glad not to be teaching these days. I'm not letting my son take a young ruffian like you home. There's no telling what trouble you will cause. It's dark so you can't walk home alone, either," she added. 

 Adele had heard enough. She had to get out of there, without the woman's husband finding out. The man could fire her, and even if he didn't, her career would be in shreds. Her parents were a hundred miles away, so what would he say, if he took her to her apartment. 

 "I promise not to use bad language, in your home, or in front of James. Just punish me and get it over with," she stated. The assertive tone of voice wasn't helping, yet she couldn't hold back. 

 "Don't think I won't young girl. I bet your parents won't say a word to you. That's where the trouble starts, in the home," she continued to lecture. 

 "You're all talk," Adele murmured. 

 "My eyesight maybe bad, but I can hear perfectly well. You want to be punished, do you?" the woman said, and pulled on Adele's ear. James' mother sat heavily on a dinning room chair, forcing Adele to follow, with a painful tug on her ear. Before she could protest she was bent over the woman's knee. 

 Adele felt her dress pulled up. "Shit!" she exclaimed. 

 "That apology was nonsense, just as I thought. You just can't help yourself. Perhaps you will learn to behave your self, the hard way," she said, and slapped Adele's bottom. 

 Adele bit her lip, hating the idea of yelping like a kid. All the fears and tribulations of childhood came flooding back. She had been a trial to her mother, and had been spanked occasionally, back then. This shock brought it all back, leaving her feeling small and pathetic. She was reliving those times, feeling wretched and vulnerable. 

 A couple of slaps stung her ass. Another slap stung her upturned bottom, when the dinning room door opened. 

 "We are trying to have a meeting here, what's all the noise. What are you doing, Brenda?" her husband asked, with a tone of incredulity. 

 Adele felt another slap. She heard, as though from a distance, a strong mans powerful voice. It wasn't her father, couldn't be, for both parents were dead. 

 "You can't do that now-a-days, it's," he was about to say it was illegal, but thought better of it. Kids knew their rights too well. 

 "Obviously the kid deserves it," one of the board members encouraged. 

 A group of board members, including the principal, stood in the doorway staring at the show. They looked amused, rather than shocked. It was the head chairman of the board's wife who would be in trouble, not them. 

 Looking upside down, toward the door, Adele recognized her boss. The high school principal was standing beside James' father. Shit! They were all staring at her, or at least her panty clad ass. If they recognized her from that, there was certainly something wrong with the education system. 

 "Let her go now, Brenda. You have no right to spank someone else's child," he admonished her. 

 "The brat deserved it, obviously there is no discipline in that home," she said, trying to justifying the spontaneous action. "In my day, students knew the meaning of discipline," she added. 

 Adele had never been in such an embarrassing position before. She rolled off the woman's knees, managing to keep her back to the dangerous group. She stood up and straightened the dress. Quick thinking had often got her out of trouble, and trouble was her middle name, when younger. 

 Now she was a woman, she should know better. Bowing her head to the woman, she tried to speak. Clearing her throat, she tried again, before the silence was broken, and they regained the initiative. 

 "I'm sorry Missis Johnson. Thank you Missis Johnson for spanking me. You were right, I deserved to be spanked," she said, with as humble an expression as she could muster. Under the circumstances it came naturally. 

 "James, take this young girl upstairs. I'll take her home later," Mister Johnson ordered. "Best carry on with the meeting. I'm sure there will be no other interruptions," he said, looking at his wife. 

 Brenda felt she had been the one chastised. Of course she realized it had been inappropriate, now the anger had cleared from her mind. "I'm glad not to be teaching these days," she commented, to an empty room. 

 James grabbed Adele's arm, propelling her through the house. Once out of earshot he laughed heartily. 

 "Is your ass sore, little girl?" James asked, thinking it was a great joke. 

 "You're still a shit," she managed to stutter. Her confidence was shaken. In this boy's bedroom, she felt like a young, inexperienced girl again. He was bigger than her, which added to the feeling of weakness. 

 "You have three choices. I take you down stairs and reveal to everyone who you are," he stopped counting on his fingers, seeing the look of dread on her face. 

 

 "I send you home, leaving Sylvia, to stay the night with me. I'm sure, after that narrow escape, Sylvia will be willing to avoid a showdown with my parents," he stated. 

 Adele looked at him with an obvious expression of contempt. "Where is she? Is she alright?" Adele asked, the concern for her friend pushing those awful moments in the dining room aside. She knew how vulnerable they both were, in this house, due to his father's position. Her friend would submit to this boy's tactics too easily. 

 "She's downstairs, helping mother prepare snacks, for the school board meeting. At the mention of the meeting, he noticed her flinch. 

 He held up another finger. With dread, she anticipated the next statement. 

 "I can keep you up here, till the coast is clear, then smuggle you out without being seen. In the meantime you can entertain me," he said, with a big smile on his face. "The choice is yours," he said, in mock seriousness. 

 Adele, for once, couldn't think clearly. If he paraded her before the board members, and the principal, her career would be in ruins. She would die of shame, before they had a chance to fire her. 

 She couldn't leave Sylvia here with him. He would have her frightened and confused, ready to submit to anything. He seemed to have worked out what she was like, while at the store. 

 The three choices were terrible. She thought to play for time. "Alright, I've little choice. Keep me here out of the way," she told him. 

 "You forgot the entertainment," he joked. 

 "Do you want to play cards?" she suggested, with an irritable look. 

 "On the floor, right now," he demanded. 

 As she slumped to her knees, Adele gasped with shock, on finding how fragile she had become. The spanking and near escape, had shaken her up more than she realized. The dire prospect of being found out was still there, ready for him to use against her. She hadn't a chance to recover under this assault to her confidence. 

 "Get it over with," she said. Her voice sounded whispery, without the usual assertiveness. 

 He sat on the edge of the bed, summoning her, with a crooked finger. The humiliation of having to crawl to him was terrible. Her mind was numb, making it difficult to think of a way out of this. 

 She crawled to him, with every movement an agony of shame. Taking in a deep breath, to steady her shaking hands, she took hold of his jeans and unzipped them. As though becoming a mere automaton, Adele went through the motions, pulling his cock free. 

 She licked it, covering its head with spit. She was conscious of every movement, only it seemed someone else was carrying it out. She determined to carryout the despicable act with skill, to get it completed quickly, though no enthusiasm could possibly be summoned. 

 Swallowing the nasty thing, she felt it hit the back of her throat. He wasn't pushing or interfering at all, it was her strength of purpose that pushed her to the limits. With a great intake of breath, she pushed down on him. Feeling his cock at the back of her throat, she swallowed. 

 Her chin nudged his balls as her lips kissed the smooth skin of his crotch. Quickly lifting her head for another desperate breath, she began a steady rhythm. 

 James watched her suck on his cock. It was fascinating to see this woman at his feet, giving him a blowjob. With friends they had joked about it, though he doubted anyone of them had experienced it. This was a mature woman, an adult, and he had her on the end of his cock! 

 He saw her completely engulf his cock, and twitched as though he would cum. He felt the tightness of her throat grip him tight, which held him back. The intensity of it kept him in thrall of what she was doing, keeping him distant from feeling it. Her head began bobbing up and down his cock, in a steady movement. His breathing speeded up, his senses sharpened, and his cock twitched. He was near an orgasm, needing to spurt his sperm into her body. The feeling dominated his thoughts. 

 Feeling him on the edge, his cock twitching, swelling a fraction, she quickly pulled up its length. The little shit wasn't going to cum down her throat. She gasped air, with an open mouth, as he climaxed. 

 Strings of white, sticky fluid, shot over her face and hair. She tasted the acrid, salty cum in her mouth, with an overpowering smell in her nostrils. The young, virile man was full of the stuff. It seemed to be everywhere. She dare not touch it, as though it were poison. 

 Adele sat on her haunches, at his feet, with his cum in her nostrils and her mouth. It was slowly seeping down her face. She couldn't move, not even to wipe her face. 

 James lay back on the bed, in a state of victorious finality. He had the usual fumbles with girls his own age, but this was so much different. He dragged his body into a sitting position, looking her over. He had to have more of this. She sat at his feet looking stunned. 

 "You better stay here out of the way. You don't want my parents seeing you like that. Get cleaned up," he told her. "The bathrooms there," he pointed out. 

 Without a word, she scrambled to her feet, nearly falling. When she closed the bathroom door, he pulled his jeans up from around his ankles. He quickly gathered up some equipment and went to check himself out in the family bathroom. He didn't look any different. A bit sweaty, but that was soon remedied by splashing his face. 

 Down stairs he found Sylvia, still helping out his mother. He quietly pulled her out of the kitchen. His mother seemed absorbed in her own thoughts, ignoring them. Otherwise, she might have checked him, from dragging her away to his part of the house. 

 "Where's Adele," she whispered. 

 "She's hiding. You need to keep out of the way too," James firmly told her. 

 "Of course I do! If your father sees me I would be dismissed. It's lucky you saved Adele, or she would have been fired on the spot," Sylvia informed him. 

 He wondered what she meant, for a moment. The expression on Adele's face, when he mentioned the school board, was quickly linked to this piece of information. So that was why she gave in so easily! 

 "In here," he said, dragging her into a guest bedroom. 

 "You have three choices," he said. This time he was more confident and spoke firmly. Adele had made her choice, and now it was Sylvia's turn.  

 

 

===

"No! I can't. Adele wouldn't," she complained. 

 He wanted to tell her she already had, though that would spoil the ruse. "Go on then. They are all in there, at the meeting. I'll get Adele too," he said, rising to go. 

 She sat on the bed, nervously twiddling with her hair. 

 "No! Wait!" she pleaded. She wasn't too sure what he meant by entertaining him, though he made it sound lascivious. He sat down on the bed, close to her. His size dominated her physically, and the awful choices clouded her mind. She just didn't want to think about what he meant. 

 Sylvia would do anything to protect her friend. If she didn't co-operate, he would present Adele to his father, and he was head of the school board. He and the principal, had seen her spanked, while she pretended to be an adolescent. She figured it was all her fault. She owed Adele a big favor. 

 "I don't think I can," Sylvia murmured. 

 He kissed her neck and ears. His lips worked around to her face, tickling and flicking, against her eyes and nose. If he had grabbed her, she would have resisted. He nibbled on her lips, not actually kissing her. She could hear her breathing rate increase, feel her chest deeply heaving. 

 It was nice. He had saved them both, from certain ruin and humiliation. They were still both so very vulnerable in this house. They needed him. She owed Adele so much, for getting her into this predicament. Adel had said to keep him sweet. His kisses were so soft and sweet. He was so gentle and considerate. She opened her mouth, unsure if she was going to say something, or if it was for him to kiss her. His tongue teasingly flicked in then it was gone. He sucked on her lips, biting on them so gently, so persuasively. She couldn't help kissing him back. 

 They devoured each other, in a passionate embrace, sucking and exploring each others mouths. She had no choice, and it seemed so good. He still hadn't touched her, except to hold her tight. 

 They fell back across the bed. James noted with relief, it didn't rattle or squeal with the sound of stressed springs. 

 His lips caressed her neck, under her chin this time, on their way to her breasts. She knew what he was going, yet couldn't stop him. She felt him bite her nipples through the bra. Not wondering, or caring, when her dress had been unbuttoned. 

 He carried on moving down. A little shiver of apprehension ran through her. This was a first date, she hardly knew him. It was an exceptional situation, and anyway, she couldn't stop now. She forgot he was nearly ten years younger, and that she had been coerced into submitting to him. 

 The intention of resisting him, trying to talk him out of it, had been in her mind, but all that was forgotten. She concentrated on the wonderful sensations his lips, and caresses from finger tips were causing. Her body seemed to vibrate from the delicate touches to her skin, until she felt on fire. 

 If he had ripped her panties off, from lust, she would have kicked out, thrown him off her prone body. He didn't make it easy for her to resist. Instead, he worked all around her panties, with finger tips and a flickering tongue. Over her thighs and mons, he stroked, kissed, sucked and flicked his tongue. 

 Her breathing had progressed to rapid gasps. She didn't have to be conscious of her sex smell or anything else, to know she was ready. Her pussy sent urgent messages, direct into the pleasure centers of her brain. She wanted to squirm under him, yet still lay prone, accepting the pleasure of it, absorbing every wonderful sensation. 

 She hooked her thumbs into the panties and pushed them down, unable to reach far, with the big man, pressing her into the soft covers. She was such a little thing, there for his pleasure, ready to be taken. He took the hint and uncovered her. His hot breath fired her sex. 

 He sucked her sex lips into his mouth, and nibbled on them. She moaned from a deep feeling of longing. She wanted to be his, to give pleasure to this wonderful man. A finger slithered over her bud. A gasp escaped her throat, as though in pain, from the electric shock of his touch. 

 He continued to suck her lips, while rubbing her swollen, sensitive bud. She lifted her hips, pushing her sex into his face. "Make me yours, take me!" Sylvia fervently hissed. 

 He agonizingly, slowly, worked his way up her body, still fingering her sex, exploring it, cherishing it, as though it were a work of art. Not even the most expensive painting could give an ardent collector, so much pleasure. Her body ached for him. 

 At last she felt his rock hard cock run across her thighs. Delirious with delight, she pushed at him, maneuvering to find him, struggling beneath his hard manly body. She bit her lip, not daring to yell. His cock had pierced her. The head of his manhood had passed her inner lips. He was poised to take her, maneuvering his body to thrust in. 

 Uncontrollably she heaved her hips up at him, needing to have it all. She needed to feel all of it, inside, deeply taking her. The long slow drive into her body, felt as though it were pushing at the walls of her vagina, opening her up. He was big, strong, and was taking her, making her his. 

 Unable to hold back a second more, he thrust in. If he hadn't already had an orgasm, with her friend, he would have done before now. The exploration of her body had been a voyage of discovery. He had guessed she needed to be taken by stealth. Talk among friends, and fumbles with girlfriends, had taught him something. 

 When he found her clit, her reaction told him she was more than ready. 

 "Fuck me hard," she pleaded, on a rush of air. "Fuck me hard," she moaned, with a whispery voice. 

 He needed no encouragement. He slammed into her thrusting powerfully. His legs and hips worked in unison, pushing his cock deep into her body. A powerful orgasm held him still, while he pumped sperm into her prone body. 

 Sylvia trembled under his body, experiencing a deep orgasm. It was her first, after having small tremors before the depth of a full orgasm rocked her mind. The overwhelming sensations made her cry out despite having to keep quiet, in that house of danger. 

 Under his chest, her muffled yell of excitement went unnoticed. Her eyes rolled up in her head as it rocked from side to side as though attempting to shake off the intense waves of intense pleasure throbbing in her brain. 

 Eventually they both lapsed into a shallow sleep. Their breathing settled down from the gasps. James held her tight, loving her at that moment. Sylvia too was completely his, for he had taken her further than anyone had, more than she thought possible. 

 Their grip upon each other lessened, and they began to whisper to each other. 

 "We had better get dressed. I get you both out of here, now my parents have gone to bed," James told her. 

 With the greatest care James opened his bedroom door to find Adel screwed up in a ball on the floor. When he laid a hand on her, she sat up, startled. 

 "It's time to go," he whispered. "Sylvia is waiting," he added. 

 Adele followed him out creeping along silently, halting when the stairs creaked. The back door was furthest from his parent's room so they used that, to make their escape. James had thought to move his car earlier. Silently moving down the street they slipped into his car. 

 Adele dare not look at her friend, not wanting to reveal what she had sacrificed to save her. She blamed herself for giving into him, still unsure as why she had. Sylvia seemed on a high having escaped unscathed. 

 James dropped them outside the apartment, without a word spoken during the short drive. James watched them hurry up the path to their apartment. "Don't be late for school tomorrow, girls," he whispered. 

 On entering the apartment the two young women remained quiet, preferring to be alone with their thoughts. One of them was in confusion, over sucking a young stranger's cock. The other, was confused over how she felt, after letting a young guy make love to her.  

 

 

===

"I want a word with you, James," Adele firmly said. She didn't feel as confident as she pretended. For an agonising hour, since he had walked into her class, she pretended not to know the young man. At last the classroom was emptying for lunch. As the last of her students rushed out, he stood before her. 

 "What the hell do you think you're playing at? This is my job, you stupid boy. Just think what you are doing and take responsibility for your actions. You can't go around ruining people's lives to satisfy your. . ." Adele cut off the tirade, on realising she was about to say, 'to satisfy your lust'. 

 The word 'lust', reminded her of last night, and that she had been forced to deep-throat him. At the time any recognition of her own arousal, had been stifled. She excused the appalling behaviour as a sacrificial act, to protect her friend. She told herself that she had sucked him dry, to prevent him from taking advantage of Sylvia. 

 The smile on his face was annoying. She stared at him, yet he didn't back down. She eventually had to look away. It felt as though he were forcing her to relive that disastrous evening. 

 "Why are you here?" she asked again. She quickly put down the piece of paper, as it revealed how much her hands were trembling. 

 "As the introductory letter said, our class has been spread throughout the school," he smiled. "Though you guessed right, I had my father influence the principal. That's how I became assigned to this class, your class," James explained. He put his hand up in front of her, stopping the next statement. 

 "Father agreed for me to be here, to give him an informal report on you. You're up for promotion, and he actually wanted my opinion of you," James gleefully smiled. "I could have told him, you ran around dressed like a slut last night. You behaved so badly, you had your ass spanked, by my mother," he smirked. 

 Adele looked at the door making sure it was closed. People were passing the classroom, but no-one heard those demeaning remarks. Despite her intentions he had taken over, so she needed to regain control of the situation. After all, it was her classroom, and he was just an eighteen year old boy. 

 Being reminded of that terrible situation was difficult to recover from. "Look here, James," she began, hearing a slight tremble to her voice. "It would be better if you transferred to another class," she suggested. 

 "What about afterwards, after my mother spanked you? The spanking could be put down to a mistaken identity, or passed off as an embarrassing prank. I don't think my parents would consider a teacher, who sucked off their son, worthy of the position," he sweetly smiled at her. 

 Adele put a hand to her open mouth, as though stifling a scream. 

 "You crept into their house, pretending to be my girlfriend, swore at mother, and got her so angry she put you over her knee. You were spanked in front of my father, other school board members, and your boss, the principal. Then you ran upstairs to give me a blowjob. Not a good recommendation for promotion, or even in keeping your job here. You probably kissed your career away, when you kissed my balls," he laughed. 

 Adele hung her head in shame. It was all so terribly true. "It didn't happen like that, it didn't. You make it sound like it was my entire fault. You blackmailed Sylvia, that was why I was there," Adele said, with a voice trailing off to a whisper. 

 He was right. It looked bad, sounded bad, and could end up so very terrible, for both of them. Sylvia would be included in the trouble, if he intended to inform on her. Seeing as it all started from his blackmailing Sylvia, that was probably his intention now. 

 "I won't give in to blackmail," Adele said. She stuck out her chin, put her hands on her hips, feeling and looking defiant. 

 "Good for you. I'll go see Sylvia, see what she has to say," James smiled. 

 "No! No need," Adele urgently spoke. She brought her voice under control, for it was revealing a rising panic. Sylvia would cave in to save her. From the look on her friends face, this morning at breakfast, Sylvia was enamoured of him. She couldn't be in love with this adolescent; he was too young to be a boyfriend. 

 "I'll handle this, leave Sylvia out of it. It's got to stop, right now," she sternly stated. 

 "We covered Sylvia's theft last night, so your public spanking needs to be covered. Right now would be a good idea," he returned right back. 

 Adele breathed heavily from being reminded, yet again, of that naughty episode. "How do you mean?" she asked. 

 A nasty part of her wanted him to demand another blow job. The thought was suppressed tightly, into a dark corner of her mind. It would be so outrageous, despite last night's performance, so she could easily refuse him. It would enable her to rally her defences, through anger and outrage. Another part of her wanted to hear him say it, for it was so wicked. 

 "A token, that's all. Quickly over and dealt with. I'm out the door then," he said. 

 Adele looked crestfallen. She looked as though she had been spanked again. She looked like a naughty schoolgirl, rather than the teacher in charge of a classroom. 

 "Just, tell, me, what, you, want," she whispered, on little panted breaths. 

 "Your panties, give me your panties," he quietly said. He leaned close toward her, dominating her as she squirmed in the chair. "Just slip them off, and place them on the desk," he firmly said. 

 It sounded like an order. His low voice vibrated through her chest. The measured, reasonable tones left it sounding like a normal, reasonable assertion. It was almost a command. 

 "I," Adele started to complain but couldn't. A mixture of her usual bravado, and some idea about getting it over and done with, pushed her into action. Once she ran her hand up the skirt, there seemed to be no turning back. She wriggled out of them, and plonked them on her desk. She tried to make it look nothing more important, than returning a boy's confiscated catapult. 

 "Pick them up," he told her. 

 Adele wanted to tell him this wasn't the deal, yet she felt entirely beaten. She had gone this far, so would have to see it through. She picked them up as ordered. 

 "Hold them out to me," he said. 

 Adele flicked her eyes toward the door, seeing students walking passed in the corridor. If they or a member of staff looked in, she would be discovered. She was holding her panties out to a student, in her classroom. What would it look like? It felt as though she were offering more than her panties to him. She was offering everything that had been inside them. 

 They were still warm, slightly damp from her arousal. That was such a damning sign. Her panties were wet, and she could smell them. Her hand shook, waving them before him as though it were a flag of surrender. Found showing off her panties, to a student, would be a miserable end to her career. 

 Instead of taking them from her hand, he lent forward and sniffed them. 

 "I can smell your sex on them, you are juiced up, girl," he said. 

 The knowing smile on his face was humiliating. He was rubbing her nose in her shame. It was terribly daunting, having a student commenting how smelly her panties were. From the build up of tension, she nearly laughed. She squirmed in her chair, and suddenly stopped. Not only was the grinding movement naughty, it was a reminder she wore no panties. She was mortified to feel a wet and slippery patch on the seat. 

 He took her panties and slipped them into his pocket. The whites of her eyes were clear, as she watched the action, wide eyed with dread. 

 "During class I will ask for advice. I will be writing a report to my father. Don't forget the school board and the principle will see his version of it. So, teacher, I will expect you to behave yourself. You will be good a girl and do as you are told. Won't you?" James asked. 

 "Yes, Sir," she demurely answered. Adele couldn't help herself. She knew she had been beaten, and felt so very pathetic for it. This young guy had her exactly where he wanted. Between protecting a friend and her career she had capitulated. She desperately needed to hide the nasty sexual desires for humiliation from him. 

 He had her so firmly in check she felt he was in charge. This young adolescent was her superior, holding her fate in his hands, as well as her panties. She squirmed on the chair, squashing her sex into the hardwood seat. He loomed over her, leaving her feeling like a silly little thing, needing his supervision. 

 "Good! So long as you understand your position. Just do as you are told, and everything will be alright," James said, sounding masterful and reassuring. 

 "Yes, sir, thank you sir," Adele whispered the words. They tumbled from her mouth unbidden. 

 "You don't sound so sure. Answer me properly, speak up, girl," he demanded. 

 "Yes, Sir, thank you sir," she croaked from a dry throat. She knew he was re- enforcing the hold over her, but could do nothing to resist, what felt like a tightening noose. All her usual sassy resistance had evaporated. She was left trembling, knowing it wasn't just from fear it was also, from being aroused. 

 "What will you do, girl?" he asked. 

 "I will do as I'm told, sir. Whatever you want, sir," she said with feeling. Every time he called her girl, she had winced, as though he were stabbing her with a pin. It felt like she was a delicate butterfly, being caught and pinned down as his trophy. It was awful calling this young boy, 'sir', yet it came out so naturally. It was especially galling in her class, where she was meant to be the authority figure. 

 "Good girl," he said, cupping her chin in his palm, holding her head up, looking into her eyes. He scanned her hazel eyes, examining her inner soul. His deep blue eyes glinted proudly, from having conquered her. 

 Adele wanted to look away, yet unable to move, as though paralysed. She couldn't help breathing in his warm breath, feeling it invade her body, taking her over more deeply than ever. She had taken him into her mouth last night. Been covered in his sperm, drank some of it down into her belly. Now her stomach churned, with that familiar feeling of needing a man. 

 It was shameful to feel that way in her classroom, as though she were negating her responsibility. She couldn't help it, as this boy had worked her up so much. Even more than that, he had her helpless, unable to refuse him anything, however wrong it might be. 

 "Don't forget, you are my girl, and have to obey me. I'll deal with you later," he added. At the door he turned and smiled at her, then left. 

 Adele continued to look at the closed door. The smile had been a pleased, reassuring look, not a gloating, mean reprimand. She shivered, as though someone had walked over her grave. Taking a deep breath, she tried to calm the growing hysteria. 

 "I can get through this," she said. Her wavering voice sounded pathetic. She squirmed, pressing swollen lips against the hardwood seat. Aware of the mess under her, she pulled the skirt down, symbolically hiding her shame. It was a terrible thought, anticipating his return after lunch. Knowing she would accept whatever he put her through, she pressed hard, hurting her inflamed sex. 

 Being in so much turmoil, there was no way she could eat anything. Instead she lifted her body out of the chair, feeling it a heavy burden. With tissues she wiped away the mess. With the tissues in her hand she made her way unsteadily to the nearest restroom. 

 There was no rest there for her. Instead she washed away the mess between her legs, though there was no chance to wash away the feelings of inadequacy. She just hoped none of her pupils could smell her sex.

 James hurried towards a side gate. Looking up and down the street he discovered the car, and made his way toward it. He jumped in the passenger seat and kissed Sylvia on the cheek. 

 "Hope you haven't been waiting long. I couldn't get away," he apologised. 

 "That's OK," she replied, as they pulled away. "Lunchtime is nearly over, but we don't need long," she murmured. 

 "You don't have a class immediately, neither do I," he smiled. He put a hand on her knee pulling up the dress, just a little. 

 "It's best you don't touch me," she said. She wanted to scold him, only it sounded like a plea. That is how she felt. She told herself not to be silly, that she must tell him, this madness had to stop. 

 He hadn't lifted his hand away, or shoved it rudely up her dress, which would have given her the strength to halt his playing. He was gently tickling behind her knee. The nice little sensations were too big a distraction, while driving. 

 

 They parked up in a quiet spot, away from school. Perhaps it had been a mistake, for her resolve seemed to shrink, the further they drove away from the responsibility of school life. 

 "We need to talk," she announced. He leaned over her, full of male strength of purpose. She lifted her hands off the steering wheel, to push him away, only he was too strong. She felt feeble, so ill equipped to stop him, she let him blow in her ear, and kiss her neck. 

 When his lips covered hers she opened her mouth, letting him take her with his tongue. Responding to his wonderful kisses, was all she could do, nothing could arm her against him. She gave up the fight before it began, letting him explore her mouth. 

 His hands were so strong and powerful her thighs parted. She began to pant around his tongue, needing air, for her head was spinning. She had intended to discontinue this torrid affair. Yet here she was, letting this young man symbolically take her, with his tongue. The last thing she wanted was to ruin Adele's career. 

 Perhaps if he had threatened her, she could have put up a fight. Instead he was filling her with warm emotion and arousing her yet again. She mustn't fall in love with such a young man, yet it seemed too late. What he did to her last night was wonderful. 

 They didn't have sex, they had made love. It was a burning, searing sexual encounter. To experience so much joy with this young man was wrong. Their careers would be ruined if it were to be found out. It was naughty and wrong. The danger added to the fire in her belly. 

 She gripped his hand between her thighs even tighter, while his fingers played with her. She heard herself whimper, with every touch upon her swollen bud. It was impossible to resist. Her body needed satisfaction and her mind demanded it. 

 He was pulling her up out of the driving seat and she helped him, knowing what was to come. She scrambled up, turning around, to get onto the back seat. Her head was spinning, with a tumult of emotions overtaking her better judgement. Part of her mind was telling her this was wrong, though it was impossible to heed the thoughts. 

 He put a hand on her back pinning her over the back of the seat. Her top half drooped over it, with her legs splayed his side. She felt him move between her thighs, pulling her panties down. His tongue pressed between her lips. She wailed out, the sound was so loud in the confines of the car. 

 Never before, had sex sounds been wrung involuntarily from her throat. It was as though last nights suppressed sounds, were finally escaping. She panted a fast tempo, with every thrust of his tongue. He was exploring inside with it, while fingers played with her bud and asshole. 

 She knew he could rudely see everything between her legs, the way she was spread out, but didn't care. It was all his to play with. She was his girl, his lover. Her mind and body was his, to pleasure. She groaned and whimpered, demonstrating how much she enjoyed her lover playing with her. 

 A great gasp filled the vehicle. "I'm nearly there! Oh! Yes! I'm there," she yelled. "Hold still, please," she whimpered. 

 James held onto her, with fingers in her asshole and pussy. He continued to gently lick her lips and thighs, circling them, bringing forth little tremors from both legs. She straightened them, stiffly holding them splayed out. He stroked her bottom with a free hand, still holding his finger inside her, waiting patiently for her to finish. He kissed her cheeks, just before she slipped down onto his lap. 

 He pulled some tissues from a pocket, pushing them between her legs. He didn't want her showing off his prowess in class, with wet patch on her dress. He managed to scrunch from under her, to get out of the car. He got into the drivers seat, as she began to sit up, trying to regain some decorum. 

 "It's my turn now," he told her. She hesitated, though under his beaming smile she seemed to melt. Reluctantly she undid his zip and pulled out his cock. 

 Sylvia looked at it and couldn't help to tenderly kiss it. This big thing had given her so much pleasure last night she wanted to lovingly caress it. She rubbed it against her cheek, licking it and kissing it. Gaining confidence she took its swollen head into her mouth. 

 With a past boyfriend she had never attempted this. It seemed so strange and mischievous, to be doing such a thing, with this young guy. She was being so naughty, so willing to try anything, it left her giddy with excitement. She was behaving like a wayward adolescent, screwing a boyfriend in a car. They hadn't even made it onto the back seat. 

 When he started to drive away, she banged her head on the steering wheel. Not wanting to lift her head up, she kept low, still holding his cock in her mouth. She wanted to ask where they were going, but the only thing to do, was to carry on. She hoped he wouldn't drive into school while she had a mouthful of his cock. 

 She giggled around his manhood, saying the word cock several times. She had never been a bad girl, as she had always studied hard, becoming a boring swat. Now she revelled in the idea of being a bad girl, screwing a handsome boyfriend in his car. It was her car, but that detail didn't matter. 

 He started to pump sperm into her mouth. She was ready for it as she had felt it tighten. She had a hold of his balls, and felt them starting to tighten too. She pumped his cock with a hand, while squeezing his sack. A mad bobbing of her head knocked the steering wheel. 

 She sucked every drop from his cock and lay there with it shrinking in her mouth. She couldn't help sucking on it, lovingly caressing it between her lips and tongue. 

 "Time to go," he gently persuaded her. 

 "Mmmm." She smiled up at him. The back of her head was now between his open thighs, with his cock, just held between her lips. She looked up at him, with a big juicy smile on her face. Daringly she sucked it back into her mouth, with a challenging look on her face. 

 "I need it back now," he laughed. He had a teacher in her car, sucking on his dick, not wanting to give it back. He watched her bare her teeth, showing that she held it between them. 

 He slapped her ass, where the dress had ridden up, showing it off. She felt his hand on her bottom realising they had been driving around showing it off while she had her head buried in his lap. Any truck driver could have seen down into the car, knowing what she had been up to. 

 She let go of his cock, trying to pull herself together. She looked up, to see they were in the school parking lot. 

 "Oh! No! Did anyone see us?" she desperately asked. 

 "No so far," he casually replied. "Here, you might need these," he added, handing her a pair of panties. They were a plain white pair, undistinguishable from any other. It gave him an extra kick, to see her desperately pulling on her friends wet panties. 

 The only time he had smelt Adele's pussy, was on her panties. Now both teachers, had smelt his cock, and sucked on it. 

 "If anyone asks, just say you met me at the mall, and gave me a lift back. No need to panic," he advised, with a warm smile. "Unless you want to tell everyone what we've been up to," he laughed. 

 Had he been reading her thoughts? She still felt elated. He had cum in her mouth right here at school. The idea of being a dirty slut, giving him a blow- job in a car park, gave her a naughty thrill.

Strolling to the classroom, swinging her hips, Sylvia couldn't help smiling to herself. Perhaps she could improve her student's grades, if she promised to blow the highest achievers. Two of the girls in class would welcome their teacher, between their legs. She sat giggling in the empty classroom, feeling unusually rude and frivolous. 

 The wet panties, kept reminding her, of the naughty lunchtime escapade. She had been a dull girl at high school, missing out on all the fun. Even when she left, the two boyfriends had been dull, and she now realised, they had been useless in bed. Now she had the attention of the school hunk, with exciting, illicit sex to contemplate. It was no wonder her head was spinning. 

 *** 

 Adel heard the door open. Out of the corner of her eye, she new it was him. Her voice quavered a little, as she told the class to start their choice of essay. She watched him stride to the back of the class. He sat there, the only one with his head up, staring at her with a challenging look. 

 He beckoned her as though he owned her. She felt he did. She walked to the back of the class. It seemed to draw out, as though the classroom was growing, or was she taking miniature steps. His smile was welcoming, drawing her in. 

 She stood next to him, leaning over his shoulder. She felt his hand, immediately recognising what he was up to, already guessing this would be his intention. She kept her legs pressed together. He hadn't tried to prise them apart instead he tickled the backs of her legs, her thighs, and stroked her bar bottom. That was enough to have her feeling highly embarrassed. The thought of someone catching her, either a student or a colleague, was awful. 

 It occurred to her, that surely she should have been outraged over this abuse. Her body was being played with, by a student, and she was concerned over someone finding out, not about it happening. If anything, she was pleasurably excited. 

 "Miss Adele," he whispered heavily. 

 She brought her attention back to him, looking at the paper he was pointing at. She read what he had written, with a feeling of dread. "Open your legs, naughty girl. Or I'll spank your bare ass," it threatened. 

 The sound of her bottom being slapped would be resoundingly loud in the quietened room. The hideous prospect of being spanked, in her own classroom was appalling. She could hardly complain to anyone, when she wasn't wearing panties. It would look as though she had tempted him. 

 Still she hesitated. Glancing at him, she saw the determined look on his face, and felt her skirt lifted higher. She had gone this far, so what choice did she have, except, to continue. It felt as though they were glued, her thighs had been so firmly pressed together. 

 In anticipation she stood trembling, waiting for his hand to reach up her skirt just that bit further, to her private little garden. As expected she felt his hand glide between her thighs. For awhile he tickled and stroked her, with finger tips and the soft palm of his hand. 

 When fingertips barely grazed her lips, she had to hold back a sigh. It wasn't from a sad inevitability, it was from a pent up arousal. She, as the boys would say, was ready for it. She wanted him to take her. A tear squeezed into the corner of her eye, then made a death leap onto his shoulder. 

 Adele was ashamed of herself. She was in great need - in her classroom - wanting this boy to hurry up and finger fuck her. She knew it, and he too became aware of it, as his finger slid between her wet, open lips. Despite the shame of it, she just stood there, letting it happen. 

 As he worked on her sex, it became more difficult to concentrate on not letting anyone know what was happening. She felt a finger push into her vagina, up to his palm, which cupped her crotch. Feeling it wriggle around inside her, while she looked around at the studious pupils, was alarming and wicked. Her head was becoming numb from the sensations hitting the pleasure centres. Everything in the world was blocked out, except the feel of his fingers playing with her sex. 

 More and more she wanted to groan out loud. She wanted to grab his hand and direct it to where she needed it. In his inexperience, he had missed her bud, therefore prolonging the humiliation. She was mistaken about his inexperience, as her friend knew so well. 

 He slowly withdrew his finger, so he could fit two into her pussy. He felt her body pushing down on them. Her legs were trembling, as though they might give way. Her breathing was heavy, and he wondered if anyone had noticed. He continuously scanned the class, for signs of disquiet. Everyone seemed engrossed in their work. 

 He avoided her sensitive bud, knowing it would bring her off too quickly. He wanted to humiliate her, having learnt last night, she thrived on it. Maybe she knew already, though surely she must have guessed by now. She certainly knew he was prepared to push her, into dangerous situations, and she was obviously willing to let him. 

 When he pulled his fingers from her, he heard a squishy sound, as she was holding onto them so tightly. An audible sigh, escaped her lips, and a pupil looked round. They saw their teacher reading a piece of paper, not guessing it gave her lewd instructions, and they returned to their work. 

 If they looked closely, they would have seen his arm at an odd angle, with his hand up the back of her skirt. Adele noticed the pupil glance, through her hooded eyes. For a moment she panicked, but was soon back to feeling every movement of his delicious fingers. Her body was on a hair-trigger, waiting to be set-off in an explosive orgasm. 

 A wet finger worked around her asshole, until it relaxed the muscle, entering her dark, forbidden hole. His thumb reached out to find her nub. It was the trigger for an orgasm. Her whole body rocked, dancing to its demanding rhythm. She let out a deep breath of air, creasing in two, with his hand trapped between her thighs. 

 As everyone looked round to see what the commotion was, James stood up. His hand was caught tight between her thighs. Her asshole gripped his finger, and as he tried wriggling it free his thumb rubbed hard against her swollen bud. She looked as though she were in agony. 

 Adele couldn't move. The orgasm had her bent over, shaking violently. Everyone was looking at her, witnessing her climax. A rational part of her mind was swamped with fear, from the humiliation of being discovered. She wanted to run and hide, from the deepest shame. 

 "Take a step forward," James commanded. He shoved her enough to loosen his hand, wiping it on his jeans as he withdrew it from between her legs. "Its OK, she's got a cramp," he announced to everyone. 

 "Can you make it to your desk?" he asked. Ignoring her feeble reply, he propelled her between the desks, holding her up. The last thing he wanted was to have her discovered. He had a teacher in his hand, under his thumb, and wanted to keep her there. A moment ago he literarily had her in the palm of his hand. It was still wet with her juices to prove it. 

 "Here put you head on your arms for a moment," he said, watching her head slump onto her folded arms. 

 "Is she alright?" someone asked. 

 "Shall we call the nurse?" someone else asked. 

 "No! She'll be alright in a moment," he reassured them. At least it appeared no one guessed what had happened. 

 Adele heard the comments as though they were from far away. The orgasm was deep and hard, yet it was the fact of having it in a classroom full of her pupils, that floored her. She sat up and smiled weakly. 

 "I'm OK! Thank you for your concern," she quietly spoke. 

 "Can you drive home? I had better take you out to your car," James stated. "It's nearly the end of the lesson anyway," he announced. "Just keep quiet, and no one will bother you," he said to the class. 

 He knew everyone would go along with that. They liked the idea of not having a teacher looking over them. They were all just eighteen, thinking they didn't need an adult to watch over them. They didn't want another teacher nosing into their class. 

 James put her jacket around her shoulders, ushering out of the class, taking the quickest route to her car. Because Sylvia and James met up at lunch time, both teachers had driven in that morning. He hadn't expected to drive Adele back to the apartment though. 

 He wondered what Adele would have thought, if she smelt her friends sex juices in Sylvia's car. It was good job they had both driven in to school. He figured they were past the point of pretending, to protect each other. They were both hooked in their own peculiar ways. 

 He had recognised how frustrated Sylvia was, when he first met her in his uncle's store. When Adele turned up dressed like a young adolescent, she was bouncing with sexual energy. As his friends would have said, they were ready for it. If there was a university course on sexual recognition and gratification, he would qualify with ease. 

 His uncle had tutored him. Making him look past the clothes and body, to examine the way they walked and held themselves. Many of the women who shopped in his store were middle aged, frustrated housewives. Not that his uncle was interested in helping them out, he was interested in selling them something. Part of that strategy involved employing young athletic, men in every department. 

 It worked too. They bought more in the kitchen department when served by these attentive, attractive men. It pleased him to see they came back for more. For the older, retired woman, he employed a more sophisticated gentleman. Though, it didn't always work that way round. 

 James ushered her into the driving seat, despite her protestations. She sat during the drive home, in a quiet state, contemplating what had happened. She had shamelessly let this young man frig her in class. He had completely taken her over, made her helpless, in front of her whole class. 

 Even now, just thinking about the humiliation of it aroused her. He hadn't hooked her on the fetish of humiliation, she had always been like this, unaware of it. Looking back she began to remember small incidents, with hindsight, only now realising their significance. 

 They were trivial, compared to that orgasm before her students. At least he had the good grace to protect her. If she had been discovered, the consequences would have been horrendous. She would have died from the humiliation. She knew that was impossible, but it would have seemed a preferable outcome, compared to facing her boss and the education committee. 

 She choked back the start of a laugh, feeling it would become uncontrolled hysteria. The vehicle pulled to a halt at the apartment. Still she sat there staring into space. James gently pulled her from the car and guided her inside. She let him take control, knowing that is what he wanted all along. 

 He didn't like to see her like this. She was like a doll, being pushed into place, staying put, where he left her. "Best if you have a lie down," he suggested. 

 When she didn't move he led her into a bedroom, luckily finding hers first time. He undressed her, pulled the covers back and laid her on the bed. This was the first time he had seen her naked. She was beautiful. He kept glancing at her, while folding up her clothes, putting them away. 

 He should have covered her up, but she looked too good to hide away. She was mature, in her thirties, yet compellingly attractive. He had her mouth, and fingered her to an orgasm. He felt he had some kind of claim on her. He got undressed and climbed onto bed with her. 

 He kissed her. She opened her mouth but didn't respond much. He kissed and fondled her breasts. While kissing a breast his hands wandered down between her legs. He was familiar with her private parts, yet seeing them, seeing his hand playing with them, was far more gratifying. 

 Concentrating so hard on her body, he almost missed her speak. A whispery voice had asked him something. 

 "Is this what you want? A compliant sex doll?" she quietly asked. 

 He stopped kissing her belly button. "No! I want the feisty, mouthy Adele, to fight me," he told her. 

 She looked at him, with her eyebrows almost crossed, trying to see something in him. He had done this to her, a terrible thing, and a devastating wonderful thing too. She was used to challenging everything and everyone around her. This young man had somehow found her weakness, and used it against her. 

 Instinctively she grabbed hold of his hard cock. She pulled and he followed. She guided him up her body, much quicker than when he had made the journey down it. Opening her legs she guided his cock between her lips, shoving hard up at it with her hips. She gripped its head with her vagina muscles. She wrapped her heels around his buttocks. 

 "Come on then, show me what you've got. Fuck me hard," she told him. 

 "I need it rougher than that, come on, fuck me hard, do me," she demanded. 

 James rode her hard, thrusting into her body, deep and fast. 

 "Yes! Oh, yes, that's it, fuck me, James, fuck my brains out, you bastard," she yelped, between each deep thrust. 

 For the second time that day she had a deep, satisfying orgasm. She felt him spurting into her, filling her up with young vital sperm. She climaxed again. 

 "Oh! God! What have you done to me, James?" she cried. 

 "I've made you cum, what else do you want," he laughed. 

 "You've done more than that, you bastard!" she replied. She couldn't find the words to explain. She was only just able to fathom how low she had sunk. 'Why', was a big question she didn't want to explore. Perhaps she would have to, to get away from the terrible hold he had over her. 

 She gave in to the overwhelming feelings of wonderful gratitude and completeness. She grabbed him and snuggled up to him. It would be nice to have him cuddle her forever. She thought of letting him rest, then sucking him into action again. It was wrong and naughty. It was compelling. Report_Story
