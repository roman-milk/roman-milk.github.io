 ****** Pet Girl Detective Ch. 01 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Chapter 01 

 Angela is trapped 

 Angela felt like an idiot dressed like this. Behaving like a dumb blonde had some advantages though, and right now it seemed the only way out of this mess. She was investigating the club and that meant scrutinizing the owner, which was why she was here. 

 It had been a stroke of luck meeting the owner's son and pretending to be a college girl, by dressing in a local uniform, worked well. She didn't have to do anything she just let him talk about himself and laughed at his jokes. He was a typical bigheaded, smart ass, adolescent. Letting him invite her home seemed to be exactly what she wanted, until getting there. 

 It wasn't what she expected at all. His father and the other men had guns and were dangerous looking people. This meeting wasn't about the nightclub business; there was something more serious going on here. What would he think if he found out she was a twenty-six year old woman, pretending to be his son's school friend? Suspicion would be an understatement. 

 She would have to keep his son on her side, playing along with the game. He was only eighteen but he too knew there was no going back and fortunately he seemed eager to fool his father too. 

 She made her choice and was going to have to live with it. She told herself not to be so melodramatic, this was only for a couple of hours then she could leave, and not come back. 

 "Hello, Sir," she said, with a little girly voice. The father glanced at her with a look of distaste. He would have welcomed something the cat brought in with more affability. 

 "Well, your home then, keep out of the way this evening, I have business to attend to," he told his son. 

 For a moment she thought her luck had changed and the father was going to send her home. The casual glance he gave suited her perfectly. The last thing she wanted was for him to look at her closely. Regaining confidence she decided to try her luck. She dropped her school bag, which hid the action of rolling a radio microphone under the sofa. 

 She scrabbled on the floor picking up the spilt school books, with Alberto helping. He winked at her with a knowing smile on his face. It would have been better if he hadn't seen what she was doing, though it confirmed he was on her side. She smiled back, probably the only adult ever, to be thankful for adolescent rebellion. 

 "I'll look after this one if you like, boss," a big gruff voice spoke up behind her. 

 Angela became embarrassingly aware of the short skirt. It had been an asset, distracting anyone from looking at her too closely, only now on hands and knees, the little skirt had ridden up showing off the white panties. She could feel them plastered to her cheeks, pulling tightly between her legs, and could just imagine the rude view that man would have. 

 She miscalculated on her dress code, for the house was decorated in a very tasteful manner, and even the thugs were dressed in expensive suites. It was embarrassing to be the one bringing down the tone of the place. She had judged him and his home on the sleaziness of the club and was wrong. 

 The muscle guy picked her up off the floor with one hand, scooping up the bag with the other, dangling both in mid air. 

 Alberto's father declined to even look at her. "Alberto, go to your room and play with your little friend. Just keep out of the way," he said, in an exasperated voice. 

 Angela felt small and insignificant, being manhandled then dismissed so lightly. She was an attractive woman used to turning heads in clubs and bars. Often in an investigation she had taken on the role of distracting a man, while a colleague searched his hotel room or home. She knew how to enthral a male, though right now, she just felt small and stupid. 

 Usually she would be dressed in a sophisticated, designer dress, so being dressed like a school girl was a disadvantage. With these gangsters around she desperately needed to keep that image running. The little tartan skirt with a white blouse was the uniform for a nearby private school. She wore it shorter and her breasts filled out the top, leaving the uniform looking lascivious, so as to attract the son. 

 It wasn't her fault they had picked the wrong evening to visit the house. How did she know they were having some illicit business meeting? 

 Alberto took hold of her hand, guiding her out of the room. She felt even more like a naughty adolescent running away from parents. Running down a corridor she let out a childish sound of laughter, with relief from escaping those rough looking men. 

 The microphone would transmit to a pre-planted receiver and record everything said in the room. It looked as though it wouldn't be of interest to her investigation of the night club, but it might gain her points with the local police, and that would be useful. 

 In his room he didn't waste any time. "You can slip that uniform off and I'll get you some clothes," he said, with a big soppy grin. "Come on, we can sneak out to a club, they'll be busy all night," he cajoled her. 

 He stood there wanting her to strip off in front of him. She thought of stripping down to her underwear to give him a fright. He was an inexperienced adolescent so she felt confident handling the bigheaded lout. She looked at him wondering if she could teach him a lesson by bringing him down from that arrogant poise he carried around so seriously. 

 He was a stern young man, tough like his father, and took his guidance on how to treat women from him too. She couldn't afford to upset him or he might inform his father that she was up to something. She put her hands on her hips determined to teach him how to look after a woman rather than put him down. 

 "You can't treat me like some stray pet you've brought home," she demanded. 

 He stood up towering over her. She looked worried and he smiled at her. "You're hungry. You didn't have lunch, I guess," he said, with a grin. 

 When he left the room she looked around. Peering out the door she found he had a suite of rooms, a whole wing of the house was his. The house was bigger than she thought and such wealth didn't come from just owning a night club. Yet again she wondered what in hell she had gotten into. She stood pensively waiting for him, too nervous to sit. 

 He came back in with something behind his back. "Close your eyes," he told her, with a light teasing voice. 

 Stupidly she did, thinking he had brought in food. Various chopping and stirring noises had been followed by the ping of a microwave. The smell of food had softened her up. She became aware of the ravenous hunger sweeping over her, knocking out good judgement. Her assumption was partly right, food was in the offing. 

 The feel of something being wrapped around her neck snapped her eyes open wide. She tried to jerk away but it was too late he had a dog collar fastened around her neck. Clipped to it was a leash and he stepped back to reveal it. 

 "That was a good idea, a pet. I wasn't too sure what to do with you, but you can be my pet for awhile," he grinned. He was looking at her like she was a new victim and the game he wanted to play with her was obvious. 

 "This isn't funny Alberto. Take it off," she demanded, while pulling and scratching at it. "Get this damn thing off me," she continued. She wanted to shout at him but couldn't take the risk his father might hear. 

 "It won't come off, once the mechanism clicks in place, it has to be unlocked. It's one of the training collars the men use on a new guard dog," he explained. 

 Angela stopped fighting the damn thing to give the young guy a withering look. He stood before her looking so clever and smug she wanted to slap his face. Taking a deep breath, she tried to calm herself, not wanting him to see she had been rattled. Besides, she didn't want the father sending his men up here to sort out any trouble. 

 "Please, Alberto, you don't have to do this. It's undignified. You have me at a disadvantage, you don't need to shame me as well," she said, with as much decorum as could be gathered, under the circumstances. She felt stupid for letting a young man take advantage and was trying to hold onto her temper. 

 "Undignified?" he laughed. "I'm surprised you can use the word without choking. Look at you, the way you're dressed. My father thought I brought home a little slut. He wouldn't acknowledge you, and if his associates hadn't been here, he would have thrown you out. I shall be in trouble tomorrow," he said, with a heavy voice, while shaking his head. 

 Angela reddened from her cheeks down to her breasts in shame. Without realising it she lowered her head in response to this condemnation of her appearance. She didn't think a club owner would be so precious over the way she was dressed, though it was understandable, he was being protective of his only son. 

 "I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. We could go to a club if you like," she suggested, liking the idea of getting out of the house. 

 "First things first, let's get started so we can eat." He told her. "On your hands and knees like a good pet," he told her. 

 She put her hands on her hips with a frown creasing her face. She thought it best to put a stop to all this nonsense right now. She was a private investigator with experience of tricky situations, so, this young eighteen year old wasn't going to push her around. 

 "A joke is a joke, but as you can see I'm not laughing, young man. Thanks for the offer of a meal but unless you take this collar off I'm leaving. I'm not in the mood for silly games," she stated. 

 "If I don't, are you're going to stamp your feet, like a dumb blonde school girl?" he asked. 

 It had been silly to think he would be fooled. Her skin was unblemished, and she did have to show Id occasionally, but there were other things besides youthful looks. She had suspected he was just going along with her, especially when his father disapproved of her. She could easily fool those men down stairs, for they weren't looking at her face, but he was. 

 "I just don't want to play games! Now stand aside, I'm going home," she demanded 

 "I'll escort you to the door, and we can pick up that thing you lost under the sofa," Alberto teased. 

 "It's OK! I'll just go," she answered, with a less demanding voice. 

 "I'm sure my father would like to see you before you leave, he didn't really meet you properly, didn't get a good look at you," Alberto smiled at her. 

 "I guess I could eat something," she ventured. 

 "I want to be a good boy and do as my father said and take the little friend up to my room to play with," he teased. 

 Angela was getting annoyed again. She didn't want to be this young guys little friend. She was dressed like it, had behaved like it, she even sounded like a little dumb blonde, but she wasn't his to play with. Especially when he looked at her like that, like she was a mouse and he was ready to chase her. 

 "What do you want to do then," she asked, sounding exasperated. 

 "I just want you to play a little game with me, nothing difficult," he cajoled her. 

 "Nothing with complicated rules then," she sighed. "Something a little dumb blonde can understand?" she added. Perhaps she could tease him into playing one of her games. A game where she took control of the situation, because he was too busy looking at her breasts to think properly. 

 "Not complicated at all. You just have to do as your told pet," he said, pleasantly. 

 "Now then, be a good pet and get on your hands and knees, ready for your meal," Alberto requested. He carefully scrutinised her, knowing this was a critical point, wanting so much for her to play along. 

 He had asked so nicely and it sounded so innocent, it left her feeling churlish refusing the polite request. 

 "No!" she said, forcefully, with hands on hips trying to feel and look defiant and that this was a final answer. Her breasts were thrust out which were a powerful weapon in her arsenal. 

 Angela felt a shock at her neck, her throat tightening in a reaction to it. Hardly able to breath she fell to her knees. 

 "Onto all fours pet, come on do as you are told," he said, talking to her as though she were a cute little puppy. With the leash pulling on her neck she leant forward onto both hands. "This way," he said. 

 Still recovering from the sudden shock she crawled on all fours into the kitchen, where he pulled her. The thick plush carpet was easy on her hands and knees but when he stopped she sat up on her haunches. She opened her mouth to complain but he made a gesture that cut her off. He had his thumb on a little black box, which looked menacing the way he pointed it at her. 

 "No talking unless I say so, otherwise, its a little shock," he said. He was watching her carefully. It showed on her face, ideas rippled across it as though she were debating what to do next. 

 That was no little shock. It hurt and choked her. Maybe the dogs had thick fur to insulate them or they were tougher. Today's events, together with near exhaustion had the inevitable result, she capitulated. 

 He watched her head hang low in despondency. "You will feel better after food," he encouraged her. 

 She saw the dog bowls containing water and what she hoped was stew, not a can of dog food. With a groan of agony she bent to the one with water to lap at it for she was so very thirsty. She had to dip her mouth into the other bowl to lick the stew up. In consternation she found it impossible to stop once she started. She was so hungry she carried on lapping and slurping at the metal dog's bowl. 

 Angela whimpered with the indignity of it, on finding she had licked the bowl clean. What shred of self-respect she had been clinging to, simply dissolve away. With a sigh she lapped at the water bowl until that too was clean. 

 He patted her ass and she realised the skirt had fallen up her back revealing everything. He pulled at the skirt and she grabbed at it tugging it back into place. "Hey! Don't! At least leave me some dignity you bastard!" she shouted, and immediately regretted it. 

 The father might have heard and sent someone to investigate. He obviously wasn't used to being talked to like that and what was worse he was a spoilt brat, used to getting his own way. 

 Inevitably she felt the charge sting her neck, just as bad as last time. She choked and wanted to plea for his mercy but could only croak out a sound. She lay flat on the kitchen floor unable to fight him. 

 She felt him pull the skirt off then drag the blouse up over her head. He left her panties for a moment around her ankles, while taking a good look at her. The bra was fiddled with but eventually he had that off too. 

 He lifted her onto all fours where she managed to stay. He drew her into the bedroom on the end of the leash. Exhausted and trembling she waited there not wanting to think about what was next. He started to grease up her ass and pussy. A sob was followed by tears dropping onto the carpet beneath her head that was hanging low in shame. Expecting him to mount her she tried to relax. It was inevitable she told herself, it would happen, so just let it. 

 She felt something hard at her asshole and whimpered. She had never let a man do that to her. It just didn't seem right and she could do without the pain. Her voice croaked without being able to even say, 'No'. 

 Looking round she could see he wasn't in position so he must be preparing to bugger her with some kind of dildo. The fear of it overrode the fear of another electric shock. No longer calm, the panic took over. She protested but the words couldn't be uttered through a sore throat. 

 She kicked out missing each time until he grabbed an ankle and she lost control of it. She looked back to see an ankle had been tied to a bed leg. He held onto the other one looking for something else to keep her under control. He grabbed a school tie and wound it around the ankle and tied it to a cupboard leg. 

 Right then she was willing to scream out for the men downstairs but her throat wouldn't allow much more than a croaking whimper. Besides, she was naked with her legs spread unable to shout for help, so where would that get her? This young guy was inexperienced, so she was safer with him, or at least it was better than rousing a gang of big rough men. 

 He was determined to do it, so Angela decided it would be better to try and relax the muscles. She felt the dildo being eased against her asshole, all the while she was trying to relax, wanting to make it easier. It was infuriating having to help him perform such a disgusting act upon her poor virgin asshole. 

 She managed to loosen up her sphincter but it tightened up again on feeling the dildo enter. He let her breath deeply, seeming to know she was suffering from the indignity of it, more than the pain. 

 She felt it slowly pushing further into her body. A warm rubber ring came in contact with her asshole and she realised with great relief that was it. It wasn't as bad as she thought. The damn thing was only in a little way, but the indignity of it was just as great. 

 Alberto stood back to admire her bottom. 

 "Up you get, come on," he encouraged. She was obviously in distress, so he put an arm around her waist, pulling her up onto all fours. He guided her, to shuffle around, accompanied with little groans, until she was side on to a full length mirror. He held onto her chin to turn her head, making her look into the mirror. 

 When feeling tired she would complain she was buggered - just a local expression. Though now it was the other way round, she was tired from being buggered. It seemed to have drained all the energy from her. She couldn't be bothered but his insistent enthusiasm made her open her eyes. 

 She couldn't make out what it was at first. The dildo had hair sticking out of it. Pointing up like a pony tail, it sprouted as though growing out of her ass. It was! Fuck! He put her through all that to give her a stupid tail! 

 "Come on, wag your new tail," he encouraged. He slapped her ass which shook it from side to side. The slap hurt but she was more afraid of the shock collar, so swayed her hips. It hurt at first but she got the rhythm right and managed to wag her new tail to his satisfaction. 

 A sob escaped her throat as she watched it wagging like a cruel reminder of surrender. It should have been white not black, she quipped silently. She was a beautiful naked woman with a young man showing complete contempt for her. 

 He should be at her feet not the other way round. It made it all the worse that he now knew he could do anything he wanted with her, however degrading. It wasn't just the shock collar either. As she wagged that damnable tail her self- worth was being waved away. Angela hung her head low, knowing she was stuck here with this callous youth, completely at his mercy. 

 She had flown down to Mexico investigating a club, on the trail of a young woman who had disappeared. She didn't expect to find her for she suspected the wealthy man's daughter just wanted to get away from things for awhile. The fee and a vacation, was enough to entice her though. 

 She had walked around the town talking to people, pretending to be on vacation, then met this young guy, and thought to dupe him. This morning she had been a sensible adult, an attractive woman, a desirable woman. She had been pleased with her self for coming up with a plan to get into the club owners house. 

 This evening the innocent young guy had duped her. 

 He reduced her to a ridiculous pet on a leash. She still couldn't comprehend how effectively he had trapped her. She was his pathetic sex pet now, his little plaything. He had whispered this in her ear and she believed it. He told her she would learn to be an obedient pet, to simply obey everything he asked of her. She tried not to believe it, though something in his manner told her it was possible, even probable.  

 

 ****** Pet Girl Detective Ch. 01 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© "I'll teach my new pet to perform tricks," he whispered, in her ear. 

 He described some of the little tricks he would teach her. Silly harmless pet tricks to demonstrate her new position in life, that she was just a silly little dumb pet. She didn't want to believe this either, though of course, when she became an obedient pet, completely submissive, she would be performing any thing he wanted. 

 He described a nasty obscene trick, and she started to breath heavily. Her head drooped almost touching the floor in resignation, knowing there was nothing to stop her becoming his little sex pet, pandering to the dictates of his warped imagination.

 Forced into a Cage 

 Angela felt stupid and pathetic for getting herself into such a horrendous situation. Alberto was a young eighteen year old, so it was difficult to blame him entirely. She had dressed up as young girl, to get into the fathers home, and it worked when he assumed she was Alberto's girlfriend. 

 She made the mistake of letting her guard down with the young guy, thinking he could be manipulate like most men, with a pretty smile and a little flirting. When he forced a collar around her neck she should have fought him off, or yelled for help. Instead she kept quiet, not wanting to bring the father and his thugs upstairs. 

 On finding it was a shock collar, it was too late. He had her helpless on the floor, gasping for breath from the pain. When he cut her clothes off, she thought the obvious was going to happen, though yet again she had underestimated him. 

 The devious bastard wanted to humiliate her, and he did a good job of it. While helpless and vulnerable, he stuck a butt plug up her ass, and made her waggle her hips. On all fours, in front of a mirror she watched a tail sticking out from between her cheeks, waving back and forth. 

 In the direst humiliating moment of her life, she wagged a tail, as though she were a pet. Before she could recover from the crushing degradation, he told her plainly what was planned for her. He was going to train her to become his pet bitch. 

 She hung her head in resignation, feeling weak and beaten. She was a beautiful young woman, yet he wasn't going to take advantage of her, not yet. Not until he had broken her would he take her. 

 "Come on, pet. With me," he commanded. Gripping the leash tight he tugged her along the corridor, walking slowly so she could keep up. She would soon learn to crawl faster when he demanded it. 

 "Careful crawling down the stairs," he warned her. 

 It was difficult, but she made it without tumbling head first. She wondered where he was taking her. The last thing she wanted was to be shown off to his father and those thugs, while naked and helpless. Alberto held the controller for the collar in his hand, letting her see it as a warning not to misbehave. 

 The back stairs led to a kitchen, which they moved through to the back door. Angela didn't care about being naked outside. It was a warm night with a full moon, perfect for a romantic evening stroll, except she was crawling on the end of a leash. 

 Led into an outbuilding, she wondered what he had in mind. On the ground floor, in a wooden building away from the house, there was a better chance of escape. 

 Alberto stopped a moment to select a riding crop, then moved her along to the back of the old barn. 

 "In you go, pet," he ordered. Expecting reluctance he slapped her bare ass with the crop, and threaded the leash through the bars. He tugged at the leash, until she got the idea of crawling forward to avoid choking. 

 "No! Please don't do this to me," Angela croaked. The metal door clanged shut behind her. She turned around and grabbed onto bars, looking fiercely at him. "No! This is all wrong! You can't get away with this! Let me out," she yelled at him. 

 "You're here to stay, so make it easy on yourself, and accept it," he told her. 

 "Someone will look for me and find me, then you'll be in trouble! You're the one who'll be in a cage, so make it easy on yourself, get used to prison food," she snarled. 

 "Who's going to send someone looking for you? Your rich father?" he sarcastically retaliated. 

 Angela looked bemused for a moment, before realizing he must have heard about her enquiries around town. She had come here looking for a clients daughter, when the girl went missing. 

 Both of Angela's parents were dead, so who would come looking for her? She had been an independent investigator for the last twelve months, so there was no partner to miss her. No boyfriend for longer than she cared to consider. The one room office didn't need a cleaner, and the rent was paid directly from her bank account. The same for her apartment. 

 "Well? Who is going to be your knight in shining armor?" he smirked. 

 "Someone, you'll see!" she lamely replied. 

 They were far enough away from the main house not to be heard. It was a double edged sword. The rough thugs wouldn't hear her shouting, though no-one else would either. 

 "Just let me go. I won't say anything. You've just hurt my dignity, I can live with that. I'll put it down to experience and move on. Come on, don't let this get out of hand. Let me go before it means trouble for you. I promise not to say anything," she ranted. 

 "Keep quiet, bitch!" was all he said. Raising the controller before her had more of an effect. She sullenly looked at him, demanding freedom with ice blue eyes. He chuckled, not feeling the need to say anything more, for the situation said it all. 

 He opened a hatch in the top of the cage, and dropped in a tattered old blanket. The bar was slid back into place with a metallic clank. The click of a lock sounded solid and final. The cage was just large enough for her to turn around in. She couldn't stand, only kneel hunched over, on the wooden floor. 

 Gripping the bars so tight her knuckles were white, she glared at him. She became aware of the leathery smell of horse tackle, mixed with dust. Angela was concentrating on him, willing him to die, not noticing what he was doing. He bent over to pull at a dust sheet, not feeling the daggers in his back. 

 As the dust sheet was pulled away he stood to one side. At first thinking it was a mirror, she saw an identical cage, with a naked girl inside. Her mouth fell open on realizing there was someone in there. The girl pressed her face to the bars of the cage, looking up at Alberto. 

 Even in the dim light Angela could see it was Patty, the young girl she had come to Mexico to find. After studying the photos her father provided, she knew that face as well as her own. What a way to find her. They were both in the same trap! 

 The girl yapped pathetically, looking up at him with puppy dog eyes, pleading for attention. He put his hand through the bars to stroke her long blonde hair. She mewed and caressed his hand with her face. She lapped up a doggy treat from the palm of his hand, chomping on it greedily. 

 Looking up at him expectantly with pleading eyes, she barked excitedly, while nudging the door of the cage with her nose. 

 Angela felt her stomach churn with anguish. It was partly from sympathy for Patty, though mostly from fear for herself. She thought it was just another way to humiliate her, when he promised to train her. The girl had only been missing for four weeks, yet he had her trained as a submissive pet-girl. 

 "Not tonight my little pet. You will have to stay in your cage. Your master has a companion to keep you company," he said. 

 Patty wagged her tail, attempting to entice him. She tried to sit up to beg. There wasn't enough room, though with her head bent to one side, she looked cute. She folded her arms up letting her hands dangle in a begging pose, trying to gain his sympathy. 

 Pushing her breasts out occurred to her, though it wasn't enough. She turned around in the cage, and wiggled her ass at him, swishing the tail. Looking over her shoulder, with such an imploring look, should have gained her desire to be let out, but it didn't. 

 Angela felt sick. Would she too become that wretched in four weeks time? Was she looking at herself, a pathetic fawning pet, in a month's time? No! She was a tough investigator, he wouldn't break her so easily. 

 Alberto wandered out of the old barn, whistling happily, feeling satisfied with himself. 

 "Hey! Patty! Can you hear me?" Angela shouted. She was trying to pull the tail out of her bottom, only it wouldn't budge. 

 "Shush! Master might hear you!" Patty hissed back. 

 Angela was about to ask if she was all right, but quite evidently the girl wasn't. "Damn!" she yelped, from the pain when pulling on the tail too hard. 

 "What happened to you?" she asked. It was a start. It would be useful to find out about his methods and routine. It would help to resist the training, whatever that was, and to plan an escape. 

 " My names Trixy Bell," she said. To emphasis the name she shook her breasts, ringing little bells dangling from her nipples. "What do you mean?" Patty asked. 

 Angela was appalled at the degrading display. "How did he get you in that cage?" she asked. Feeling around the butt plug she found it had been inflated inside her. There was no way of getting it out. She arranged it out of the way to get more comfortable. 

 "Master bought it for me, it's my home," she said, with a frown of consternation. 

 "What was all the barking about," Angela tried again. It was difficult to get through to the girl, and she couldn't concentrate enough to phrase the right questions. 

 "Master usually lets me out in the evening. He takes me for a walk, and if I've been good, he mates me," Patty sighed. She looked longingly at the barn door, wondering if Master might return. 

 "He mates you!" Angela exclaimed. The words spilt angrily from her lips. The image of this young girl, on all fours in the barn ready to mate with those guard dogs, was appalling. She shook her head, shattering the horrid idea. 

 "Yes, he mates me. Sometimes in my muzzle, and sometimes in my ass. Best of all is when he mates in my cunt!" she eagerly informed Angela. She wiggled her hips, swishing the tail back and forth. 

 "Master would have mated with me, if you hadn't been here!" she petulantly said. "I haven't even been out of my cage this evening, just a quick walk this morning, and it's all your fault! You made the Master angry!" she accused Angela, with sullen looks. 

 "I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault, you shouldn't be there in the first place, neither of us should," Angela firmly told her. 

 "Where should I be then?" she asked. 

 "At home with your father," Angela suggested. 

 "This is my home, its where I belong, with my Master. He owns me, so he can do whatever he likes with me. You have a lot to learn," she added. Patty rolled up in a ball, pulling the blanket around her. It was evidently the end of a worthless conversation. 

 Angela had tried to find a way into the girl's unfamiliar world, and failed. She knew it needed to be subtle, so as not to alienate her. It was something she remembered from a magazine article. After such a horrendous experience this evening, and several late nights touring the clubs, she was too exhausted to think straight. 

 Musing over the situation, looking for a way out, she curled up and fell asleep. 

 *** 

 Next morning she was cruelly awoken by a cold spray of water. 

 "Shit! Stop that. What in hell?" Angela spluttered. Alberto was training a hose on her, washing her down like an animal. She was caged, with a tail up her ass, but she was no pet of his, or anyone else's. 

 "If you don't stop complaining you'll be muzzled," he warned. He didn't need to threaten his new pet with the shock collar this time. She glared at him, while shivering, yet kept quiet. 

 Patty turned around for him to shower her body all over. He passed her a towel, with Angela's left draped over his shoulder. 

 "What about me?" she crossly asked. 

 "Do you promise to behave yourself?" he asked. 

 "I don't have a choice," she sullenly responded. 

 "No you don't. Unless you want to make a fight of it. I'll win, be sure of that!" he laughed. 

 It was infuriating to be so helpless and dependent upon this young guys whims. She was hungry, and figured he would withhold breakfast if she defied him. 

 "Do you agree to be a good little pet?" he asked. He watched her nod in resignation, knowing it wasn't true; not yet. 

 "Well then?" 

 "Yes, master, your little pet promises to behave herself," Angela tersely spoke. 

 Clearly not meaning it wasn't enough to save her self-respect. Was this how it would be from now on? Witling away at her moral fiber, until there was nothing left, until one day she really meant it. It clearly worked on Patty, so it might just take longer for her to become his pathetic little pet-girl. 

 She watched him return with two shiny metal bowls. One was labeled 'Trixy Bell'. He shoved the other bowl through a gap, below the cage door. Looking at the mess with disdain, wasn't the answer. She was salivating, despite her attitude to it. She sniffed at it, then looked over to see Patty keenly lapping it up. 

 She dipped a hand into the bowl, ready to scoop it into her mouth. 

 "No! Good little puppies lap at their food. They do not use their paws," Alberto warned her. 

 The sight of that torture instrument in his hand was enough incentive to behave herself. She couldn't fight him and the demands of her stomach. It was a delicious smelling bowl of chili. Once started there was nothing stopping her. She noisily licked the bowl clean, only using her hands to hold the bowl still. 

 Angela looked across at Patty, for guidance on what to do next. The reflexive action shocked her. Looking away quickly before he noticed, wasn't enough to save the agony of recognizing what she had done. She now knew his training was working on her subconscious. 

 "If you want out of your cage you have to do as your told, understood?" he asked. 

 Patty was whining sweetly, not wanting to be left behind. Last night Angela learnt from Patty this might be the only opportunity to be free of the damn cage. Being scrunched up in the cage all day, if she didn't co-operate, would be terrible. Besides, it was an opportunity to find a way of escaping. 

 "Yes, master, your little pet will be good," she reluctantly agreed. 

 He dropped something into the cage. "You can work it out for yourself. Make sure you're wearing it before I get back," he demanded. 

 He led an excited Patty out of the cage on a leash, with her padding on all fours beside him. The purpose of the thing he dropped on her, became obvious. She pulled on the mittens, then realized the rest of it couldn't be adjusted, so ripped them off again. 

 Before he got back, she had managed to fumble into it. Through the bars he fastened a leash to the collar, and pulled her out of the cage. The need to stand up and stretch was overwhelming, but it was impossible. 

 The knee pads saved scratching her soft knees on the rough floor. Sturdy chains linked the knee pads to the pads on her hands, with chains linking her knees to elbows. Her ankles were bent back as they were shackled tightly to her thighs. 

 Not only couldn't she stand, or stretch, the mittens prevented her from removing the device. She was stuck on all fours, meaning it would be impossible to run away. 

 Even if she could run, a press of the remote control would have her collapsing on the ground. The devious bastard had her trapped! 

 She could see how even crawling out of the barn, was a treat for Patty. The sun had risen, announcing the usual clear sunny morning. It was still cool, so the sun felt pleasantly warming. The fresh air too, was welcoming. 

 "How do you like your new paws, pet-girl?" he asked. 

 It was impossible to answer without spitting anger at him, so she kept quiet. 

 They stopped over a board with a hole in the middle. The stink told her what it was. She felt him fiddling with the tail until it was pulled free. That was something else she would have to learn; how to get the damn thing out. She had tried last night and given up. 

 "Hurry up, or the tail goes back in," he told her. 

 It was a necessary evil, though he seemed to find it more uncomfortable than she did. Peeing and shitting wasn't something to be performed in front of anyone, but it seemed to irritate him, so she didn't mind. Out of necessity he wiped her bottom and thighs, as she couldn't reach. It would have been another humiliation, except he carried it out in a practical manor. 

 They continued a tour of the garden, presenting her with the opportunity to scrutinize her prison yard for possible escape routes. 

 He sat down on a bench in the walled garden. It was private and peaceful here. The grounds-man tended it occasionally, with an instruction not to enter the small barn. He was afraid enough for his job, to obey the boss's only son. All seemed perfect, in a world he was creating for himself. 

 Two beautiful blondes were his. One ready to obey his every whim, with the other at his feet, ready to be trained. Owning one was good, but owning two little pet-girls was an unexpected bonus. That this second one had come looking for his pet, to rescue her, was ironic. 

 He smiled at the pet, while gently stroking its long blonde hair. 

 Angela was furtively looking around, noting where the only gate was located. It would have to be used, as scaling the wall would be impossible. Even if something could be used to climb it, there was a long drop the other side,. 

 Only vaguely aware of him stroking her hair, it was nevertheless calming. Her breathing returned to normal, after the exertion of inexpertly crawling around the garden. This was another demeaning trick he had taught her. Perhaps she could fit the harness loosely enough to escape from it, ready for an opportunity to run away. 

 Feeling a hand slide under her belly, her body tensed. With a tight grip of the leash, she was going nowhere, so had to endure it. The hand slid up to a breast, and cupped it. He bounced the hanging breast in the palm of his hand, feeling its fullness and weight. He gently squeezed a nipple between his fingers. 

 Despite the horridness of this uninvited mauling of her body, her nipples responded. They became swollen, though she couldn't blame it on the cold, for the garden was warming up, as she was. How long had it been since having a boyfriend? Thinking of a sexual partner wasn't helping. 

 He let go of her breast to stroke her back. The feathery massage brought her breathing rate up. Finger tips stroked her backbone, down between her cheeks, and back again. Round her neck, and behind her ears, to start over again. Eventually she relaxed, giving in to the nice sensations. 

 This time his fingers lightly skirted her tail, to trace over her thighs. She held her breath, expecting him to lunge at her sex. Instead he circled it, teasing with finger tip touches, just missing the most tender place. 

 At last he cupped her lips, and held her sex in the palm of his hand. It was a surprise to hear the outrush of breath. Only then realizing she had been holding it, in anticipation. How could she be wet, from being molested by this boy? 

 She was both angry and bewildered. She kept perfectly still, not wanting to encourage him, yet wanting something more. 

 "This will have to be shaved," he whispered, close to her ear. 

 The warm breath tickling the soft hairs of neck and ear, exposed a weakness, when she softly moaned. 

 "I'll shave it bald, ready for my use," he calmly informed her. 

 Angela bit back a response, knowing it was the vile words, 'Yes, Sir'. Despite the heartfelt effort to hold back, a deep meaningful sigh betrayed her. 

 The efforts of men her own age to seduce her, had failed. She had been too busy building her business over the last year or so, to get involved. Yet this young boy had conquered her. 

 Underestimating him, as a mere eighteen year old, had cost her dearly. Everything had been stripped away. Clothes, dignity, and her freedom was lost. He intended to take her persona, and mold it to fit his needs. It was more than being subsumed into a possessive marriage, or a melding of two lovers. 

 At that moment she was willing to submit, even if it was crudely called mating. Even if she had to call him master. After all, he had captured her, and mastered her. She could feel basic animal instincts taking over, swamping the frail veneer of civilized behavior. She was on heat, needing to be mated, wanting to be his bitch.  

 

 ****** Pet Girl Detective Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© He patted her head. She looked over her shoulder at him, with smoldering half closed eyes. She swayed her hips, wagging her tail. He stood up with the leash dangling loosely in his hand. The look of dismay on her face told him all he needed to know. She wasn't going to be as much of a challenge as he first thought. 

 He tugged on the leash for her to reluctantly follow. This time there was no verbal protest, even though she was being led back to her cage. 

 Angela crawled into her cage without complaint. Unlike Patty, she wasn't prepared to beg him for anything. Especially not for sex. She pushed the tail out of the way, and curled her body into a ball. She had a lot to think about, though the ideas were distinctly unpleasant. 

 Damn! Him! He had me wanting it so much, I was prepared to give in to him. He's left me high and dry. Well, high anyway. She pulled a corner of the blanket between her legs, to mop her sopping pussy. It was just because she had been without a partner for too long, she firmly told herself. 

 A whispered voice interrupted her thoughts. 

 "He didn't mate with you then!" Patty stated, with a leer. 

 Angela looked up at the annoying girl. She was disgusted when the pet-girl splayed her legs, to show off her leaking pussy. 

 "I wouldn't want to mate like an animal," Angela rebuked her. 

 Angela pulled the blanket over her head, to try and block out the awful chuckling. It was a small comfort that he had rejected her after fucking his pet. She was an attractive woman. Any man would find it difficult to refuse her. 

 It was impossible to sleep and so the time dragged. Conversation with the pet- girl was impossible, with such a distorted image of the world. It only reminded her of what might be her own fate. It had to be resisted. After this morning's disgrace, escape looked like the only chance of avoiding ending up like her. 

 Angela was about to harshly interrogate the girl, without bothering to spare her feelings. The sound of voices from outside quickened her pulse. Of course, someone had to be tending the garden. It couldn't be imagined that spoilt brat getting his hands dirty. His hands had felt so soft and tender. She shuddered at the memory of what he did to her that morning. 

 On hands and knees she was tense, preparing to shout, only just holding back. If it was Alberto he would be sure to gag her, if she yelled out for help. The barn door opened admitting someone, not him. 

 Still she held back from shouting out. She trembled in anticipation. 

 "So this is what you have been up to!" Rodriguez shouted. 

 "Father, its, just, I'm just having some fun with them," Alberto lamely explained. 

 "This is not fun, it is wrong and dangerous. Think of your family name. Does it mean nothing to you. This is no way to treat a decent woman. These are such dreadful specimens of womanhood. I do not like you bringing such women into my home. They may be willing to play your filthy games, but not in my home. Get rid of them, now! You know what to do! Tidy up this mess. Be a man, just do it, get rid of them," the father shouted, and marched off. 

 Angela shrank back in the small cage, feeling fragile and vulnerable. The fierceness of his voice was enough. Such an instruction from a gangster was plain enough. Being 'got rid of', could only mean one thing. She had heard it said in old movies. Taken for a one way ride was easy enough in the jungle. 

 The time to escape was now, before it was too late! Angela shrank back against the bars of her cage, as Alberto approached. She watched him unlock the pet- girl's cage. 

 "Don't worry Trixy Bell, we're going for a ride," Alberto said, trying to calm her. 

 Even she felt worried, though evidently unsure why. 

 "Bring your blanket with you, we won't be coming back," he told her. Wrapping it around her, he tied a loose knot under her arms, making it into a wrap. She couldn't walk upright, after being cooped up in the cage, and so used to crawling. On the leash, hunched over, she nervously followed him out of the barn. 

 His words about not returning, rang alarm bells. A 'one way ride', was the only way to interpret his comment. He was going to become a man by making his first hit. Surely two helpless women didn't count! 

 In the vehicle, that would be the best moment to escape, while he was driving. Unless he had help; maybe one of the fathers thugs. 

 A false calm settled over her. She saw the remote control for the collar in his hand. Her eyes were everywhere, looking for something to use as a weapon. A place to run to. She wasn't wearing the harness. As soon as the opportunity arose, she could be up and running, running for her life. 

 The side door of a van was open, right up against the gate. There was no one else to help him, so the best time to make a move would be while he was driving. After the bright sunlight of midday the interior was pitch black. The dull metallic clunk woke her from the dream like state. 

 "Hey! No! You can't do this to me. I'm too young to die!" she yelled at the top of her voice. 

 The words were cut off from the outside world, as she was, when the door slid shut with a soft whoosh. With her eyes wide, staring starkly around the interior, she could see the small cages. She was in one. They were for the guard dogs. She had heard them barking at night, when let loose in the grounds. She was wearing one of their shock collars, used to train them. 

 She was just a bitch in a cage, being driven away to be disposed of like an unwanted animal. Patty whimpered, probably from being in an unfamiliar situation, or maybe she picked up on their dangerous situation. It got to Angela. She too started to whimper. 

 Rodriguez strode into the house. "That damn boy! I should have re-married after his mother died. He needed a good woman to look after him, and I failed him as a father," he said, sadly shaking his head. 

 "At least he isn't on drugs, like a lot of youngsters these days," Joe commented, trying to console him. "Where's he gone now, I heard the van take off at speed." Joe asked. 

 "He's getting rid of those whores. He was cavorting with them in the barn! Playing some nasty game," Rodriguez sighed. "He will have to pay them off out of his allowance. I'll not give him a cent to waste on them," he added. 

 "Come on, forget about it. We have a lot of business to settle. We've been successful keeping the gangs out of our town, but it's a continuous battle. The clubs keep everyone happy, and the profits enable us to provide a good salary for the police. That is a good practical way to fight corruption. Don't feel bad my friend. you have saved our town from a lot of trouble," Joe lectured him. 

 "OK! OK! Maybe it's a passing faze he's going through," Rodriguez said, and patted his friend on the back.

 The van pulled onto a track in the jungle, to bounce around for a few yards. The door slid open flooding the interior with light. 

 "Come on out," Alberto tersely ordered. 

 He didn't want them to pee in the van, as he would be the one to clean it out. It had been a few hours since he walked them this morning. 

 He would have to go into the bank, where they would take their time handing over all his allowance in cash. Half an hour into town, another half-hour shopping to buy them clothes. Another half hour drive out to the motel to dump them. They would be stuck in there for at least a couple of hours. They would be bursting and would pee on the floor, or worse. 

 "Damn!" In the hurry to get out of his father's way, he had forgotten to remove their tails. 

 "Come on! Get out!" he angrily commanded. 

 "No! Please, let me stay with you, please," Angela whimpered. 

 "What? Just get out, I don't want you peeing in the van," he told her. 

 "I want to," Angela gulped. She wanted to live. 

 "I'll do anything you want. I'll be your pet-girl. I'll be ever so obedient, honest. Please keep me as your little pet-girl," she whined. Taking her cue from Patty, she opened her legs, offering her sex to him. 

 Alberto looked from one to the other, wondering what was going on. They seemed to be competing with each other. 

 "I'd love to have bells on my nipples. On my shaved pussy too, if you like," she offered, while thrusting it at him. "Please, Master, keep me as your little pet-girl," she whined, and barked to show she meant it. 

 Alberto was shocked. He was building himself up to face a huge unpleasant scene, when handing over his allowance. His father thought they were whores, paid to play his games. This woman wouldn't be so easily bought off, or so he thought. 

 The fierceness on his face began to relax. The usual casual confidence hadn't fully returned, but the handsome young man was back. 

 "You want to be my pet?" he asked. 

 "Yes, Master, please! Keep me as your pet-girl, please," Angela yelped, trying to sound like an eager puppy. She yapped excitedly. A stay of execution brought on a sense of euphoria. 

 "You promise to be a good and obedient pet-girl?" he asked. 

 "Oh! Yes, Master! Whatever you want, Master. Your pet-girl will always be ready to mate with her master," she gushed. 

 He could see her sex swelling; opening up to him. She was ready to mate right now. What had happened to her was difficult to work out. What he was going to do with them, where to keep them, was a problem. 

 He lent against the hot metal side of the van, with arms folded, thinking through what to do next. The old farm, maybe there. 

 "OK! I'll look after you," he began. 

 Angela yapped with glee. Patty joined in. There was no point in shouting over the sound of their excited barking. He smiled at them, and slid the door shut. Report_Story
