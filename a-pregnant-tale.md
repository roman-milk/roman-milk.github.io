 ****** A Pregnant Tale ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© It was a typical neighborhood party, with the people clustered in pre-ordained groups, one group talking football, another gardening, soccer moms in the family room and the do-it-yourselfers in the dinning room. Since I work swing shift I had arrived a little after midnight and had a lot of catching up to do. Fortunately, I lived right next door so I did not have to worry about drinking and driving. I was fixing myself a drink in the kitchen when Lee came in to get more ice. Lee was the hostess and I had been in heat with her since the day she and her husband Brad had moved in. She knew of my interest, but we both knew it was something that was never going to happen and our relationship had settled into a good-natured semi-sexual give and take. Lee was three months pregnant and she had that healthy sexual glow that women get and to me she had never looked sexier. 

 "I can't get over it, babe. Three months pregnant and still the sexiest woman in town. You look good enough to eat." 

 Lee beamed at me, "Why thank you sir. All compliments are gratefully accepted." 

 The front doorbell rang dragging me out of a fitful sleep. I glanced at the bedside clock and wondered who could be getting me out of bed at 9a.m.on a Sunday morning. I grabbed my robe and went to the door; looking out the peephole I saw Lee standing there. I opened the door and invited her in and only then did I notice the strange way she was dressed; high heels and a raincoat, but a glance outside showed nothing but bright sunshine. 

 Lee turned to me and said, "Did you really mean it last night when you said that even though pregnant I was the sexiest woman in town?" 

 I stared at her in some confusion - why was she asking me a question like that? Regaining my wits I said, "Absolutely! All you have to do is give me a chance and I'll prove it." 

 Now, any other time that I would say something like that she would just laugh and call me a big flirt, but this time she surprised the hell out of me - she opened her raincoat, let it fall to the floor, and stood naked in front of me. 

 "Would you be willing to prove it by fucking me?" 

 Sweet Jesus, would I ever. I picked her up and carried her to my bedroom where we spent the next three hours doing our absolute best to please each other. She was a tiger in bed and every time I felt that I had given all that I had in me she would manage to get me up again. We only stopped when it was time for Brad to get home from playing golf. 

 The story Lee gave me was that once they found out she was pregnant Brad stopped having sex with her, even though the doctor told them that it would be perfectly all right until late in the pregnancy. Brad would not touch her for fear of hurting the child. Brad was willing to eat her pussy to try and give her some satisfaction, but that was all. She had been used to having sex daily and since Brad had cut her off she had been climbing walls, but no matter how much she begged and pleaded he would not fuck her. 

 A thought occurred to me; "If he eats you out tonight won't he taste me?" 

 Lee snorted, "I hope so! It will serve the asshole right." 

 The next morning Lee was at my front door as soon as Brad was on his way to work. We went straight to my bedroom, but before starting anything I had to satisfy my curiosity; "Did Brad go down on you last night?" 

 She smiled, "Yes he did. In fact, he did it ten minutes after he got home from playing golf. Everything you put in me there was still there. I told him it was a natural fluid that occurred when women were pregnant. I got a big kick out of knowing that he was licking up cum that he refused to put there. 

 For the next several months Lee and I fucked every chance we got. Monday through Friday she was at my house as soon as Brad left for work. On Saturdays she would call me if she had to leave the house to go anywhere and I would meet her. On Sunday Brad played golf and Lee and I worked on our own hole-in-ones. And she always made sure Brad ate her out when she had been with me; she told me he never figured it out. 

 Eventually though, Lee became too far along and we had to stop. She finally got around to having a little girl and I started counting the days until the doctor would give her the go ahead to resume sex, but I was to be severely disappointed. Several weeks after the baby had been born Lee came over to my house for a cup of coffee. She thanked me for being her friend and for being there for her in her hour of need. She told me that if I ever needed anything to just let her know. I told her that what I needed most was for her to get the go ahead from her doctor so we could resume our sex life. Lee gave me a strange look and said, "We can't start up again. Once the doctor says it is all right Brad will take care of my needs." 

 And so it was. Soon she and Brad were back on their everyday schedule and I was left with a longing that could not be satisfied. I stopped going to the neighborhood parties where I might see her, and in general, I did everything I could to avoid her. One morning she knocked on my door and asked me to have coffee with her. She asked me point blank why I was being a stranger. I hemmed and hawed before breaking down and telling her the truth - I just couldn't bear to be around her after what we had together, knowing it would never happen again. 

 "I thought we were friends," she said. 

 "No Lee, we were much, much more than that, and that is what I can't forget." 

 The next six months crept by. I had a series of girl friends, none of which could hold my attention for long. Occasionally I would see Lee in her backyard and I would feel a longing that was unbearable. And then one morning the doorbell rang and I opened the door to see Lee standing there. I moved aside to let her in and as I turned from closing the door I was just in time to see her dress fall to the floor. Naked, wearing only high heels, she smiled at me; "Guess what lover - I'm pregnant." Report_Story
