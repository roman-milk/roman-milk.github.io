Mickey Takes The Dare
=====================

Mickey and I got married, but we had a problem. We both worked for the same company and the company policy was that a married couple could not work together in the same department. What made things worse is that I was her supervisor and that was a definite no no. As a result we kept our marriage a secret and neither Mickey nor I wore our wedding rings. We figured we could get away with it for however long it took Mickey to get her promotion and transfer to a different department. 

 Mickey and I have pretty decent senses of humor and our situation gave us a lot to laugh about. For one thing, Mickey is a fine looking woman working in a department with about twenty guys. There were two other women in the group, but one was a grandmotherly type and the other was a married woman who was a religious fanatic. The result was that Mickey got all the male attention. She was constantly asked out on dates and occasionally she would let someone take her to lunch just to tweak my nose. Every so often I would have to go out of town for a day or two and Mickey would always make sure that she went out on a date while I was gone. When I'd call her on the phone she would tell me about how she had to fight the guy off when he brought her home and then coyly ask me: 

 "You do still want me to fight them off, don't you?" 

 We also usually stop at a local bar after work with the people from our group. We do some social drinking, shoot some pool and dance to the music on the jukebox. A few times Mickey has taken on board enough alcohol to get really loose and she has been felt up, propositioned and even dry humped on the dance floor. When she gets in that condition she loses her inhibitions and on those nights I have to keep a close eye on her. More than once I've had to step in as she was being escorted out to the parking lot. I've been able to do this without raising any questions because we ride to work under the guise of car- pooling. I simply say that I'm ready to go and we leave. We would go home and have a big laugh over whoever it was that had to go home with a case of blue balls. Mickey laughingly told me: 

 "You better stay on your toes. Relax your vigil and let one of those guys maneuver me outside and I may have to put out for him." 

 She shouldn't have said that - it got me to wondering what she would do if it happened. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 I got a partial answer the following week. We had stopped at the bar and I was shooting pool while Mickey was dancing with anyone who would ask her. I made sure that I kept her glass full and after about two hours of drinking and dancing, I saw Mel, the guy she was dancing with start to work her toward the side door. I kept my eye on them and when they reached the door I turned my back on them and watched them in the mirror behind the bar. I saw Mickey take a quick look around for me, but of course my back was to her and I watched as she and Mel went out the door. I deliberately scratched on the eight ball so I could get out of the game and then I went out the front door and then went around behind the bar and started looking for them. I saw a dome light come on and then go off and I got myself in a position where I could see what was going on with out being noticed and then settled in to watch. 

 Mel and Mickey were sitting in the front seat of our car. At first they were just talking and then Mel put his arm on the seat back behind Mickey and slowly moved closer to her. Suddenly he pulled her to him and kissed her and she pushed him away. About a minute or so later he did it again and again she pushed him away. The third time she didn't push him away, but she didn't respond either. Mel held the kiss for twenty or thirty seconds and then Mickey's arms came up and they started doing some pretty heavy necking. I stayed were I was and watched, wondering just how far she was going to let this go. I knew she was still in control of herself - her looking around for me when Mel had walked her out proved that. I decided to wait and see. Since it was our car I could always go up and say: 

 "Break it up guys, I've got to get going." 

 They necked for a good five minutes before Mel's hands went to Mickey's tits. She'll stop him now, I thought, but she didn't. I saw Mel open her blouse, push down her bra cups and let her tits fall loose. He bent and took one in his mouth while he caressed the other one and I began to wonder about my assessment of Mickey's control. After several minutes working on Mickey's tits, Mel started to ease her back against the car door. I ran around to the front of the bar, went through the front door, out the side door and headed to the car. When I got there Mel and Mickey were sitting there talking and the only sign that something had been going on was that Mickey's blouse was not buttoned properly - it was one hole off. 

 "Sorry to break this up guys, but I've got to get going." Then I got a little dig in, "You want to stay Mickey? I'm sure Mel will give you a ride home." 

 "Oh no" said my bride, "I've got to get going too. I've got a big day tomorrow and I need to get home and get to bed." 

 On the ride home Mickey said, "I wondered how far you were going to let me go." 

 

 "What do you mean?" I asked. 

 "Don't bullshit me, hubby dear. I saw you over by that van." 

 I asked, "Just how far were you going to go?" 

 Mickey gave me a wickedly evil grin, "Let me put it this way - his cock was out and my hand was on it when you ran for the front door." 

 I looked at her in disbelief; "You would have fucked him?" 

 Again the wicked grin, "We will never know, will we?" 

 Our sex that night would best be described as frenzied. I could not get enough of Mickey and every time I thought I was through I'd get an image of Mickey with Mel's cock in her hand and I'd be ready to go again. The next morning Mickey told me that if she'd have known how her playing with another mans cock was going to affect me; she'd have done it a lot sooner. 

 "It had nothing to do with you having your hand on another man's cock. It had to do with me feeding off of the energy that you got from doing what you did." 

 I did not get much work done the next day. All I could think about was what had happen the previous night. The burning question was knowing that I was watching, would she have gone all the way if I made no move to interfere? I asked myself that question so many times during the day that by that night I just had to know the answer. And, of course, there was only one way to find out. 

 It was three days before we stopped at the bar again. The evening was a repeat of the last time we were there except this time Mickey did not look around when Mel walked her out the door. Again I watched as the mating ritual played itself out, but this time when Mel pushed Mickey back I stood still and didn't move. I saw Mickey's legs come up in the air and then I watched as Mel's naked ass moved up and down between them. Ten minutes later they sat up and began arranging their clothes. I went back into the bar and waited. When they came back in Mickey came over to me: 

 "Did you enjoy the show?" 

 "No I didn't. Did you enjoy tossing your marriage away for a dipshit like Mel?" 

 "Don't give me that garbage. You could have stopped me at any time." 

 "That isn't the point here Mickey. I shouldn't have to stop you. At no time in our marriage did I ever say I wouldn't mind if you fucked another man. Keeping an eye on you when you were bombed and teasing the hell out of guys is one thing, but no way am I ever going to agree to let you fuck another guy. The other night I watched to see if you would stop it or let it go. If you stopped it then we had a marriage. If you let it happen there is no way I could ever trust you again. Tonight I watched again to see if you were going to tease the man and then stop and get out of the car. You didn't stop so I just hope Mel's fuck was worth what it cost you. Maybe he can give you a ride to his place, because you aren't leaving here with me and you can count on being locked out if you try to come home." 

 I got up and left the bar leaving Mickey standing there looking like she had just been hit by a bus. Report_Story
