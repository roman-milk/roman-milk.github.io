(Michelle) 

"Fuck!" I yelled to myself as I saw the flashing red and blue lights of the cop car now following me. I sighed to myself as I pulled over to the side of the road. It was dusk and I just wanted to get home. Everyone went over the speed limit through this area. There was nobody around here anyway, it was the outskirts of town. Probably just some asshole trying to meet his monthly quota. I rolled my eyes as I unbuttoned some buttons to better display my 32B's. I'm a good looking woman, 24 years old, short brown hair, good body. I'll just show this guy some cleavage, and he'll let me go on my way. I heard the knock and as I lowered the window, I put on my best face and turned to face the cop. I was not prepared for what I saw. I was not staring at some older, overweight man. What I saw was a woman, and not just any woman. 

There were two things very apparent on first glance. She had big tits and a bad attitude. The look on her face conveyed she was not in any mood to mess around. 

"License and registration, ma'am." She said as if she would rather be anywhere else. I handed them over. 

"I'll be back." She said as she walked back to her car. As she did, I couldn't help but take her in. Her body did not quit. She was skinny and fit, but curvy in all the right places. Her ass was heart-shaped, and just the right size to make men drool. She shook it as she walked, as if mocking me with its perfection. She spent a few minutes in her car, and as she started to walk back towards me, I was able to fully take in the rest of her. It was hard to miss her massive breasts as they jiggled in her tight fitting uniform. Her face held up its end of the bargain. Full pouty lips, and as she raised her aviators over her hat, I was able to see her piercing dark eyes. She was taller than me, too. As much as I hated to say it, she was absolutely gorgeous. Perfect tan, perfect body that looked ready to burst out of her tight uniform, and even though her hair was in a ponytail, I could tell it was shinier, longer and fuller than mine. I hated her. 

"Do you know why I pulled you over, Mrs. Decker?" She asked, leaning down to talk to me. She glanced down at my unbuttoned blouse and I noticed a twinkle in her eye. 

"I don't know, Officer." I said, playing dumb. She looked down at me as if I were in idiot. 

"Well, Michelle..." she started, as if talking to a slow child, "You were ten miles over the speed limit. You know that's illegal right?" 

"I didn't notice. I'm sorry if I did." I said, shocked at her attitude. 

"Do you think I'm lying? Do you think I enjoy pulling over dumb bitches like you?" she said angrily. 

"Excuse me!?" I raised my voice to her in anger. How dare she? 

"Since I'm clearly the only one hear with a firm grasp on reality, I'll make it clear. You were ten miles over the speed limit. Most drivers notice these things. I'm tired of people trying to play dumb with me." She said angrily. 

"I'm not lying, I didn't notice." I stuttered, flustered by this whole exchange. 

"So, you're just negligent. That's what you're saying?" She said. 

"No, it's just..." I stammered, not able to find the right words. 

"Listen up, honey." She started. "I've tried to be nice here." Nice? This is nice to her? "But, clearly, you are a negligent driver. Now that I think about it, you were closer to twenty miles over the limit. So here's the deal. You will be receiving a ticket for speeding. On top of this, I'm going to hold on to your license. I'm going to advise you to take a driver's education course. You will get your license back as soon as you can show that you understand the rules of the road." 

"Are you kidding me!? I need my license! I, I, I have a job. I know how to drive." I stammered, incensed. 

"You should have thought of that before driving like a two-year old." She said mocking me. 

"What is your problem with me?" I asked. Clearly, she had some vendetta. She stared at me darkly then responds. 

"You assume I'm some idiot that you can push around. You've had people let you do what you want your whole life. But guess what, honey? The world's a tough place. You need to know that you can't just flaunt the rules and do whatever you want. You should be thanking me. In fact, I want you to thank me. If you don't, I'm gonna have to take you down to the station." She smirked as she finished her speech. 

"How dare you! My husband is the CEO of one of the biggest companies in the city. I'll get his lawyers on you, and you'll regret having ever tried this shit on me!" I yelled at her angrily. She smiled an evil smile at this. 

"Is that right? I'm surprised a woman like you can hold down a man. I mean, look at yourself. You're clearly a bitch. And by the way, button up your shirt. You're impressing no one. Even if it was a guy cop, he still would have given you a ticket with that pathetic display. I'm guessing hubby aint too satisfied with those either." She said giggling. 

"Go fuck yourself!" I tell her. 

"Listen, honey, you need to make a choice. You can humble yourself and thank me for enforcing the law and keeping these streets safe. Or, you can go to jail and force your big bad hubby to bail you out. What do you say?" She asked. 

I had to control myself. I can't let myself go to jail. So, gritting my teeth, I turn to her and say: 

"Thank you." 

"What was that?" she said, wanting me to embarrass myself more. 

"Thank you." I said, trying to feign kindness. 

"C'mon, give me a smile when you say it, or I won't believe it." She said. I turned, give her as little of a smile as I could, and said" Thank you." 

"There you go." She said, congratulating me as if I were a child who did well. "Can I get your name and badge number?" I asked as civilly as I can muster. 

"Sure you can." She said, turning and pointing her badge and nametag above her massive breast. 

"Badge number 6991. Officer Veronica Rivera. Don't you forget it." 

********** 

I sat in my car stewing about this whole situation as I waited for the tow truck to arrive. I knew my husband was working later than usual today on a big project so I didn't want to disturb him. Once the tow truck I arrived and I gave him the address of my house, I sat in the passenger seat going over what just happened. Officer Veronica Rivera had made an enemy today. I'm pretty easy going, but this woman had it out for me for some reason, and I was not going to take it lightly. If she thought taking my license will hold up in court, she was clearly mistaken. I'm a law student, so I knew what she did was over the line. We arrived at my home and the tow truck driver dropped off my car in my driveway. I walked inside my small home still angry. I couldn't wait for my husband to get home so I could vent. I don't think I sat down for the thirty minutes I was waiting until he walked in. 

My husband James was the same age as me, 24, and I love him with all my heart. He is gorgeous, funny, and incredibly smart. I don't know how I landed such a perfect man as him. I think he loves me even more than I do him. He is quite smart, as I said. Everything I told Officer Rivera about him was true. My husband was the CEO of a self started company he created in college. It started small, but in the last year or so, it has gained massive success. The money started rolling in, so, although we've lived moderately since marrying a year and a half ago, we've been looking to upgrade to a bigger home and start a family. 

"Hey, what's up?" He asked me, sensing my anger. I immediately started laying in to this bitch cop as I explained what she did to me. My husband let me air this out, and as I finished, he pulled me into a hug as I started crying. For a split second I could've sworn I saw a look of almost disappointment, but I didn't have time to think about it as the tears started flowing as all the stress came out. 

"It's okay, Michelle. We'll get this all worked out. She was clearly in the wrong and you'll get proven right. Don't worry about it." He told me. He looked down at me then kissed me. We separated then I kissed him back hard. I needed to forget about today. I practically dragged him towards the bedroom. We ripped our clothes off as we started to get down to business. My husband has always been a great lover. His thick, nine inch dick didn't hurt matters. He was patient with me as we started to make slow, sensual love. 

Although it was great, I was still dwelling on what had happened. Being around her, and some of the things she said, made me feel inadequate. My husband didn't seem to mind my 32b breasts as he sucked and chewed on my hard nipples as he thrust into me. I wonder if he wished I had larger ones. One's like hers. My god, they had to be DD's, maybe even E's. But I know men. You could be gorgeous and sexy, but men don't want to be with a stone cold bitch. And that's what she was. With the attitude that girl has, I'd be surprised if she lets anyone in her pants. 

James's thrusts became more desperate. As we climaxed together, our worries were forgotten as we fell asleep in each other's arms.

(James) 

My wife was lying in bed as I woke up before her, as I usually do. Last night was about as angry as I'd ever seen her. That cop really got her worked up. I don't know why. I feel like she might be leaving out part of the story. I hate to stereotype, but I get the feeling this cop is some tough chick who hates prettier women. I feel bad thinking like that, but it's probably the truth. 

There wasn't much we could do about her situation since it was the weekend, so I thought I could cheer her up by doing some work house hunting. She had been looking for her dream house, and I couldn't wait to give it to her. 

She woke up in better spirits than last night. I saw a side of her that I never thought I would see. Michelle is bright, funny, and fiercely independent. I had never seen her that bullied before. I had never seen her so torn down, and it brought up a lot of feelings in me. The biggest being that we would vindicate Michelle, and I would make sure that this bitch cop would never do this again. She won't get away with this. We spent most of the day looking up houses on the internet. Michelle wasn't satisfied by any of them. She was waiting for the perfect home. I could wait as long as it took. 

********** 

(Michelle) 

When my husband asked me if I wanted him to drive me to my classes, I refused. I didn't want for him to act like my parents, dropping me off at school. I ended up calling a taxi. I was able to get a court date a few days later to contest my ticket. Once I got to court, I was ready to lay into Officer Rivera. But, it ended being a waste of time, as they pretty much just scheduled a full court date for this a week later. I was pissed about this, but the justice system isn't perfect. It was on my way home from my court date that I saw it. The perfect house, with a for-sale sign in the lawn. I told my taxi driver to stop. I got out of the car and just looked at the house. It was perfect: two stories, swimming pool, big lawn, and a big garage. I loved it. No one was home, so I took down the realtor info. I was going to get this house. All of my dreams would come true in here. 

I excitedly told my husband the news when he got home. He was happy that I was happy. He had to leave the next day on a business trip, so I told him I would check the house out and would handle it. I could not wait. 

********** 

It was two days later when I met the realtor at the house. The inside of the house was even better than the outside. I couldn't imagine selling this house. So much space here to fill up, to make it into a home. 

"Why is the owner selling?" I asked the realtor, a nice looking older woman. 

"Well, she is a single woman and she said it's too much space for one person" She said. I nodded in agreement. This house was designed for more than one person. 

"Honestly, I'm sold on this place. Where do I sign?" I asked the realtor. 

"Wow, uh, well, the owner should actually be here soon. When she does, when can start discussing details." The realtor said. Just then, the front door behind me opened. I turned and smiled at the entering home-owner. Then my jaw dropped as I realized I was staring at Veronica Rivera. She said hello to the realtor as the realtor explained that I was interesting in buying the house. Then she turned and smiled wide when she saw me. 

"Well, Mrs. Decker, it's nice to see you again." She said, holding out her hand. I could barely hide my revulsion as I had to shake hers. 

"You two know each other?" the realtor asked. 

"We've met." She said simply. "Do you mind if we talk for a few minutes?" she said to the realtor. 

"Absolutely." The realtor said, stepping outside. 

"Nice to see you again, Michelle." She said simply, walking over to the bar to get herself a drink. Despite my hatred of her, I couldn't help but noticed that she still looked amazing, even after a hard day's work. It made me hate her more. 

"Want a drink?" she asked. 

"No." I said curtly. 

"So I got notice that I'm supposed to be in court next week." She started. "I think that's a bad idea for you." 

"Why so you say that?" I ask. 

"Because if this goes to court, I may not be in the mood to sell this house to you. But if you drop it, then I might be more willing to sell." She explained. 

"Are you kidding me? What is your fucking problem?" I asked her. 

"Is that a no?" she asked, with an evil smile. I considered giving in. But, this was about respect. She treated me like garbage. I could not let her win. I would take my chances. 

"I'll see you in court." I told her, and then I stormed out of the house. 

Un-fucking-believable. That fucking bitch owned the greatest house I've ever seen. I'll fucking show her. I'll beat her in court, and then I'll get that house from her. I don't know how, but I will. 

********** 

I was walking out of my classes the next day with some friends when two police officers approached me. 

"Excuse me, ma'am, are you Michelle Decker?" one of the men asked. 

"Yes." I said cautiously. 

"Ma'am, you are under arrest for possession of narcotics." one of the cops said. 

"Are you kidding me? This has got to be a mistake?" I said, panicking. All of my friends are looking on in shock. The cops handcuffed me. I am so embarrassed. They read me my rights as they put me into a police car. I know that Veronica is behind this. 

Eight hours later, I was still sitting in a cell at the local jail. I was seething. I have never done drugs in my life. That bitch Veronica was fucking with me. Finally, an old, fat cop came up to my cell. 

"Mrs. Decker, you're free to go." He said. 

"That's it?" I said. 

"It appears as if there was some sort of paperwork mistake. We deeply apologize." He said simply. 

"I'm a law student, you know. You'll be hearing from me." I said. 

"We are deeply sorry." He said again. He led me out to a waiting cab. As I headed home, I vowed to defeat Veronica Rivera. 

********** 

The next few days were hell. I kept seeing cop cars wherever I went. It's her. I know it. I just couldn't wait for Tuesday, when justice would prevail. Unfortunately, my husband would not get back til later Tuesday night, so he would miss the trial. I called him and told him what happened. He was pissed and asked if I wanted him to come home. I said no. I'm a big girl, and plus, he's working on a very lucrative deal. I practiced the next few days what I would say and do at the trial. I was ready. Then, the unexpected happened. 

Some dirt bag druggie had kidnapped his kids at gunpoint. He was holding them hostage till he was talked into releasing them by one Officer Veronica Rivera. Then, he tried to kill himself, but she shot him in the leg, preventing him from doing so. He was then arrested. Officer Rivera was being hailed as a hero. She made the national news. I even saw some website say something along the lines of 'hot cop is a true hero'. A lot of responses, at least online, and in conversations, were about how hot she was. As much as I hated her, I respected what she did. But I realized this was bad news for my trial. 

And I was right. She showed up to the trial like a rock star in her uniform. Everyone in the court was star struck, even the judge. I pled my case, but I came across like some bitter, crazy woman. I was fighting a losing battle. The judge ruled that I had clearly broken the law, and who was he to overrule the judgment of a true hero. I lost. I had no license and I had to go to driving school. Unbelievable. As I was leaving the courthouse, embarrassed, Veronica came up behind me and whispered in my ear, "You'll never get my house, bitch." She smirked evilly as I started to cry on the stairs outside the courthouse. I sat there outside for half an hour until I heard a familiar voice. 

"Honey?" James said. I looked up and saw his caring face. I smiled from beneath my tears, stood up, and hugged him. 

"I'm guessing it didn't go well." He asked. I laughed, then responded, "I lost. I lost the case, and then she told me she would never sell the house." I looked up into his eyes. He looked angry. 

"Who is this bitch? Who does she think she is? No one treats my wife like she has." He looked around. 

"You know what, c'mon." He grabbed my hand and led me to my car. 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 

"We're going to her house. I'm gonna have a talk with her." He said angrily. My heart beat excitedly as I heard this. I had never seen him this angry. To see him this willing to defend my honor, I had never loved him more. I had never been more attracted to him. I was excited. My husband was gonna sort this bitch out once and for all. I guided him towards her place. All of a sudden, I had a thought. 

"Have you watched the news lately?" I asked. 

"No, why?" He asked. 

"Nothing. Don't worry about it." I said. Good, I didn't want him to have any sympathy for her. We soon approached her house. Her cop car was in the driveway. Some people were leaving. It looked like an open house just ended. My husband jumped out of the car and walked quickly towards the door. I tried to follow, but he told me to stay, so I stayed, standing outside the car. He went in just as the realtor opened the door. She looked confused. 

"He's with me." I yelled out to her. She looked a little relived, but not fully, so I told her, "You can go. Veronica wanted to meet with us." 

"OK." She said still unsure, but she decided to leave. I stood out there for five, ten, fifteen minutes. I was standing outside for a half hour when I thought, "What is taking him so long?" 

********** 

(James) 

I burst into the house past the realtor as I left my wife outside. I looked all over, but I could not find this bitch. I heard some movement on the floor above me so I headed upstairs. I heard some noise behind a slightly closed door. As I pushed it open, ready to give her a piece of my mind, I came to a stop as I catch sight of her. 

"The open house is over." She said, turning around. She smiled brightly as she saw me. I was stunned by the sight of her. This was not what I expected at all. She was gorgeous. She was wearing tight jeans and a tight blue tank top. I couldn't help but notice her massive tits, just bursting out of her top. I could see the outline of her nipples under it, just begging to be sucked on. Her body did not quit, and her pretty face was plastered with a gorgeous smile as she checked me out. 

"And you are?" She said coyly. 

"Uh, James." I stammered.  

===

"Hi, James, I'm Veronica." She said, holding out her hand. In a blur, I shook her hand, unconsciously wanting to touch this perfect creature. 

"Can I help you James?" she said, taking a step closer to me. I cleared my head as I remembered why I was here. 

"You've been making my wife's life a living hell for the last few weeks. I want to know why." I asked, with less venom than I intended. 

"Oh, you're married to Michelle. I have to be honest, you're not what I expected." She said. 

"You're not what I expected" I said without thinking. She smirked. 

"Listen, James. Your wife had this coming to her, and I think you know that. She was speeding, and tried to lie about it. I can't take women like that. I don't know how anyone could stand a woman like that." She said. I was becoming uncomfortable with the situation. 

"You have a vendetta against her. You won't let her have her dream house." I said. 

"Please, you think I'm gonna sell my home to a dreary little bitch like that wife of yours. No. I don't deal with losers. I'm a winner. And I think you are too." She said seductively, putting her hand on my chest. 

"Excuse me?" I said, pushing her arm away. 

"How could a man like you, clearly successful, handsome, a winner like me, be dragged down by a cow like her?" she said. 

"Fuck you!" I told her, defending my wife's honor. 

"But you know I'm right. You burst in here ready to tear me down, but then you saw me. Now you understand. You realize why your wife hates me so much. What the real issue is." She started. 

"What's that?" I asked. 

"Your wife is jealous of me. She took one look at me and realized I'm the better woman where it counts. She could not accept her inadequacy to me. She met a real woman who won't put up with her shit, and I put her in her place. And now you know that." She said. 

"That's not true." I said angrily. 

"Yes it is. Your wife got owned by a real woman, and you know that. Once you came in here and saw me, you realize how inadequate she is next to a woman like me. It can't possibly be a turn on to see your dreary little wife being taken apart in the presence of a real woman. To be constantly defeated by a better woman. You couldn't help but lose a little respect for her, right?" she asked. 

I backed away. This woman was a sociopath. She was evil. But, was there a little truth to what she was saying? Wasn't there a moment when I had a little bit of disappointment in my wife when I heard what this cop did? A loss of respect when I saw my wife so easily taken down a peg. No, no, of course not. Veronica started to nod as if she could see what I'm thinking. I back away towards the door. 

"Listen, none of this matters. I just want the house. This is my wife's dream house. You have no reason not to sell it except for your twisted agenda. If you don't agree, I'll bring my lawyers down on you, and you will regret it." I told her. 

"Oh, some fight. A backbone. I can respect that." She said. This woman was crazy. I turned to walk out. 

"Wait!" She called out. I stopped and turned to face her. "I'll let you have the house, as long as you agree that she doesn't get to live here." What! What a ridiculous offer! 

"That's ridiculous! Why would I agree to that?" I yelled out. 

"Because I think you want to crush her dream." She said. 

"What the hell are you talking about? You're crazy." I yelled at her. 

"I'm not." She said simply. "Listen, you've seen what I've done, how I've crushed her each step of the way, and yet you don't hate me. You're scared of me, but you don't hate me. I think you respect what I'm doing." She said, starting to circle me. "You've heard what I've had to say, yet you're still here. Part of you likes what I've done to her. You understand that I'm her superior. You know what I've done to her was deserved. The fact that I'm crushing her does not bother you." 

"What makes you say that?" I said angrily. She faced me, reached out, and grabbed my crotch. 

"Because you're rock hard." She said, rubbing up and down my hard nine inches. I pushed her away in shock. I backed into the partially open door, accidently closing it. 

"Don't fight it, James. I know what you're feeling. You see my body. You know you can't go back to her after glancing at perfection. How could any man get it up for a woman like her when they've met a clearly superior woman? A woman defeated and embarrassed again and again. You know that it turns you on, what I've done. You realized the first time your wife told you about me that your wife is a loser. No one knowingly shacks up with the loser after meeting the winner. You knew you loved me at that moment, didn't you? You didn't even have to see me to love me, right?" she said, stepping closer to me. 

"You're crazy." I said again, reiterating my point. 

"So here's my offer again. You move into this house, with me. With a man like you around, I won't have to sell. You move in here and crush her. And she would know how completely she has been destroyed by me when her husband decides to move in with me over her. You choose me over her. After all the bad stuff I did to her, you still choose me over her, because I'm that much better. You know how it much it would turn you on to crush her dream, betray her, and move into her dream house with her hot-bodied nemesis, leaving her with nothing? To be so completely owned by another woman, that's so hot." She said, her nipples rock hard under her top. I was speechless. 

"I treat your wife like shit, and it turns you on even more. How do you think she would feel if she came up here and caught you in bed, fucking the shit out of me? Cause that's what's gonna happen! How heartbroken would she be if she knew that the fact that I've made her life hell turns you on? That after explaining all the bad stuff I've done to your wife, it got you so hot that you couldn't control yourself and just had to stick your huge dick into my tight pussy." I swallowed deeply in response to her speech. 

"And believe me, my pussy is tight." I believed her. "No doubt much tighter than that worn out piece of shit you are married to. I'm prettier than your wife. I have sexier legs, a hotter ass, and better hair. And then there's the obvious. I've seen what your wife has to offer up here." She said as she pointed at her set of jugs "And compared to these suckers, she's got nothing." she said, clearly turned on by how this was going. "These are 44EE's! What has your wife got, B's?" she asked. I nodded without thinking. "Trust me, once you get your hands on these, there's no going back." I knew what she was saying was the truth. "So here's what's gonna happen." She said walking towards me, forcing me towards her bed. "You're gonna take off your clothes, I'll take off mine, and we'll get down to business. But it won't be easy. It'll be rough. It'll be nasty. I'll wear you out." I could tell just by looking at her that she fucks hard. "Most men can't handle me. But you can. You can keep up with me because you're as nasty as I am. You want it rougher than I do. I can tell. Once we fuck, you'll never go back to another woman, especially not a woman like her. Once we fuck, you'll realize this is where you belong. With me. Fucking me. Day after day, until everything else becomes meaningless to you, except for me. You'll divorce that bitch of a wife of yours, and marry me. You'll give me money and buy me whatever I want. You'll treat me like a princess. I am Officer Veronica Rivera. I'm 28 years old. And I am yours." She backed me up till my legs felt the bed behind my legs and I fell to a sitting position. 

"I can't do this. I love my wife." I told her. 

"You think you do. You think you know what true love is. But you don't. True love is what's going on right here, right now. With every word I say, you fall more and more in love." With every word she said, I fell more and more under her spell. Being eye level with her massive breasts probably didn't help. She pushed me back so I'm now lying on my back on the bed. She reached down and started undoing my belt buckle. Before I could stop her, she reached in and fished out my rock hard, dripping nine-inch dick. 

"Wow. Just wow. You have got a fantastic dick, James." She said with a bright smile. I can't focus as she started to jack me off with perfect strokes. I tried to reach down to push her away, but she brushed them away easily. I groaned out load as she holds me on the edge of a massive orgasm. She pulled her hands off of me as I groaned in disappointment. 

"Calm down baby. We've got a long night ahead of us. Let it simmer. It'll feel so much better once you do cum." She said, with a loving, nurturing voice. My dick calmed down as the urge to cum decreased. 

"There you go, baby. Just listen to me and let me take care of you." She said. Then, she lowered her head and immediately inhaled my hard dick all the way to the root. She gently rubbed my balls as she did this. Her blowjob felt perfect. Her tongue was working magic. I had never had a blowjob this good. And the sight of her pouty lips around my dick was almost enough to set me off. She went up and down my hard dick with her warm, wet mouth. Her eyes met mine, communicating the pleasure I was feeling. This went on for a few more minutes until the urge to cum rose again, just about to happen, then she pulled away. I tried to reach down to finish myself, but she pushed my hands away. I gave up and fell back again. 

"Take off your shirt." She ordered huskily. I immediately complied. She stood up and I was able to take in her perfect body again. 

"Moment of truth baby. You have to make your choice, right here right now. Do you want to fuck me?" she asked. I couldn't say no. 

"Yes." I said desperately. 

"You just need to tell me one thing before this body is all yours. Do you love me?" she asked. I had known her for twenty minutes, and she wanted me to declare my love for her. It was ridiculous, yet something compelled me to tell her what she wanted to hear. 

"Yes. I love you." I tell her, not sure if I believed it myself. 

"Will you do what I said? Will you divorce your wife and move in with me?" she asked. 

"Yes. YES!" I tell her, wanting to tell her whatever she needed to hear to get her to fuck me. She smirked, and then yanked her top over her head. There were her 44EE breasts, pouring out of her black lacy bra. She unbuttoned her jeans and yanked them down. As she did she turned around and exposed her thong-clad ass to my leering eyes. She leaned up and turned back around to face me. Her long shiny, curly brown hair fell poured down to her mid back as she undid her ponytail. She reached back behind her to unclip her bra. 

"This is it. Once you see these, there's no going back. You'll be with me. You'll be obsessed, never able to turn me away. Now tell me! Tell me what you want to see!" she commanded. 

"Show me your fucking tits!" I yelled out at her. She smiled then dropped the bra. There before me were the best pair of breasts I'd ever seen. They were huge, round, soft looking, and perky. There was little sag. The nipples were hard and pointed, sticking out from her perfect areolas. I was hypnotized by them as she bent over and pulled off her thong. I couldn't help but glance at her perfectly trimmed pussy, with just a small landing strip, just the way I like them. Veronica Rivera stood before me fully nude, hands on her hips. My dick was throbbing. She leaned onto the bed and crawled over me so she now straddled me, her pussy hovering over my hard dick. She reached down and grabbed my dick pointing it at her pussy. She rubbed the head up and down the outside of her pussy. 

"Tell me what I want to hear." She looked down at me, commanding me. 

"I love you." I tell her, telling her what she wanted, willing her to sit down. With that, she sank down onto my dick. She was so tight. I'd never felt one this tight. It sucked me in as she sat onto it until I was balls deep inside her tight wet pussy. Her tight pussy was massaging my dick as she sat in place. I'd never had a pussy feel this good. She looked down at me, and as I looked up into her eyes, I realized I was having sex with an evil, self-centered bitch. A hot-bodied, big-titted, evil bitch. After all the things she said and did to my wife, and the things she's done to me, I realized I had only one thing to say to her. 

"I love you." I said, fully meaning it. She smirked, as if she knew that this time, I meant it. She started bouncing on me, taking my dick all the way in an out. Her massive breasts jiggled above me. I couldn't resist. My hands reached up and cupped them, giving them a healthy squeeze. They were so soft. They poured through my hands as I squeezed and squeezed again. I couldn't get enough. She leaned down and pressed her body against mine and shoved her tongue into my mouth. My hands moved down to her perfect ass and squeezed them as our tongues wrestled against each other, fighting for dominance. She was winning that battle as her tongue felt like it was buried down my throat as we humped at each other. She broke away, leaned up and smiled. She started bouncing harder. I was in for a long night.

(Michelle) 

"Where the hell is he?" I said to myself, deciding to finally go in and see what's going on after waiting for more than thirty minutes. I looked around and saw no signs of life. Then, I hear some creaking from upstairs. Oh, god, I hope she didn't attack my husband. She's a cop, she knows how to fight. I climbed the stairs and looked for the source of the noise. I heard some noises from the room to the right. I opened the door and look in. 

There, in the middle of the bed, sat Veronica, facing away from me, nude, covered in sweat as she bounced up and down on my husband's dick, which is buried in her no-doubt tight pussy. Her hands are on his chest, and his are on hers, cupping her massive breasts, which looked absolutely massive, even from behind. As I watched her perfect ass flex, I tried to take in what I was seeing. This didn't make any sense. What I was seeing didn't add up. It was impossible. My husband would never fuck this bitch. He knows I hate her. He knows what she did to me. It's impossible. This has to be some sort of trick. Maybe she drugged him. Then I realized there was a mirror above the headboard of the bed, and Veronica was staring right at me. 

"Oh James, you are so good. Tell me again. Tell me!" She moaned. 

"I love you. I love you. I fucking love you!" He moaned again. "Your pussy is so fucking tight." 

"How about my tits?" she asked. 

"They're so big and perfect" he said, pounding her harder. She started moaning louder and louder. 

"Oh, fuck. Fuck! FUCK ME I'M CUMMING." She screamed out, bouncing as fast as possible. My husband matched her bounce for bounce. Then he groaned out, like an animal, as he held his dick deep inside her and started cumming. My husband was cumming in this bitch. I could see his balls flexing as he came. Finally, they both relaxed. Veronica sat back up and brushed her hair behind her head. 

I was seeing red. I ran towards her, ready to fight for my man. But she was quicker. She leapt off the bed towards me, grabbed my arm, and twisted it behind back. She bent my arm so far back I thought it would break. She moved me across the room, grabbed her belt and pulled her handcuffs out. She sat me down on a chair, grabbed my other arm, and cuffed me to the chair. 

"You'll have to do better than that, bitch." She said. 

"What did you do to him? Did you drug him or something?" I asked in disbelief. 

"Drug him. HA!" she laughed. "No, bitch, all that happened was that he met me. That's all it took. One glance at me, and he was gagging to fuck me." 

"You're lying." I told her. She reached her arm out to my husband, who was sitting up on the bed. He grabbed her arm and pulled her towards the bed. He threw her down onto the bed, rolled on top of her, and lowered his once-again hard dick towards her pussy. I'd never seen him recharge this fast. He stabbed his dick into her again. She wrapped her legs around him as they started to fuck again. I had never seen my husband so animalistic. These two were rutting like animals. Afresh sheen of sweat coated them as they fucked each other. My husband leaned his head down and sucked and chewed on her perfect nipples voraciously. What had she done to my husband? I had never seen him like this. Within five minutes, they both came again, together. How could he just do that? Have unprotected sex with some slut he just met, and just cum in her. We rarely have sex without a condom. 

Unfortunately, they weren't done yet. My husband had unending stamina, it seemed. Veronica bent over on all fours, facing me, as husband got behind her, and buried his hard dick in her ass. Her ass! Only real sluts let guys fuck them up the ass. It was disgusting. Yet, my husband was loving it. He started pounding her hard. Veronica looked right at me. 

"You know, uh, me and your hubby, uh, fuck yes, we made some decisions while you were waiting outside oh so patiently. Fuck me! Fuck my ass! Hubby's gonna be leaving you. He decided he'd much rather be here, living with me, being with me. He wants a divorce, sweetie. He's gonna marry me, we'll live in your dream house, and have lots of beautiful babies. While you'll be sitting in your tiny house all alone, your husband will be fucking your enemy day and night in your dream house while you wonder why. Isn't that right, honey?" she said. 

"Is it true, James?" I said, tears in my eyes. I looked up into the face of the man I love, but who I now didn't recognize. 

"Yes. I don't love you anymore, Michelle. I only love her." He said. "Oh Fuck!" He screamed 

"Oh, fuck yes!" Veronica screamed, "I'm cumming too." They came together, my husband cumming in the ass of this bitch who's ruined my life. She was an absolute cunt, a whore, a terrible person. And what does my husband do? He fucks the shit out of her and falls in love with her. My husband fell back, exhausted. Veronica was catching her breath, staring at me, showing off her perfect body in front of me. I looked over at my husband, his cock resting lazily on his leg as he passed out, worn out from fucking this whore. Veronica started putting her clothes back on. 

"Well, that was fun." She said, walking over behind me. She disconnected me from the chair, but recuffed my hands together. 

"What are you doing?" I asked, numb with anger. 

"I'm taking you down to the station. You assaulted a police officer honey." She told me. 

"You bitch, you fucking bitch. You won't get away with this!" I yelled out angrily. 

"Yeah I will. Because I'm a winner, and you're some loser who can't hold on to her man." She said. I thrashed and screamed, but she was stronger than me. I looked at my beautiful husband, passed out on the bed. 

"Don't worry. He's not going anywhere." She told me. I walked out defeated as she led me to her cruiser. 

********** 

I've been in jail for seven months. Apparently, the courts don't like it when some "crazy woman" tries to attack a hero cop out of "jealousy". They threw the book at me. That, on top of the fact that they found drugs at my home, which Veronica no doubt planted, added up to me getting an eight month sentence in jail. Just being stuck here drove me nuts. No word from my now ex-husband. No doubt he shacked up with that slut. 

Upon my release, no one wanted to talk to me. All my friends wanted nothing to do with me. I was kicked out of school. I tried to go to my house, but it was empty, with a for-sale sign in front. I had no idea where my stuff was. I had nothing. I had my driver's license, at least, but little else. I checked my bank accounts, but they were pretty much empty. I was able to get some money out and check into a cheap hotel room. I was there for two days when I received a large package from FedEx. I opened, curious to find out what was inside.  

===

There were a stack of papers inside. Newspapers, documents, pictures. I started looking through them. The first was an article detailing how my ex-husband had closed a multi-million dollar deal. This was the deal he was working on his last business trip when we were together. Next were articles detailing my arrest. They were clearly biased to favor that bitch Veronica.. If they knew the truth, they would all be on my side. Next was an article explaining how Veronica chose to leave the police department to pursue other interests. She left the force with a hero's ceremony. The next item was a Maxim magazine, with Veronica on the cover! The headline was "Sexy Cop Struts her Stuff." The bitch was actually famous! I found the article, and throughout were sexy pictures of her. I read the interview with her, conducted by another woman, and found a highlighted section. I read it. 

"Q: Are you seeing anyone?" the interviewer asked. 

"A: Actually yes. There was an incident a few days after the hostage ordeal, where this crazy woman attacked me. I stopped her obviously, and she went to jail. But her husband learned the error of his ways and hooked with a real woman." Veronica responded. 

"Q: You're dating that woman's husband?" the interviewer asked. 

"A: Well, we're engaged now. Just goes to show you, if you come after me, I get you'll back worse." Veronica replied. 

"Q: Haha. Wow. That's hot." The interviewer replied. Seriously, what woman would support what she did? I slammed the magazine shut. 

The next article I saw was a wedding announcement. There was a picture of Veronica and James, and they both looked so happy together. I threw the picture away in disgust. 

Next was a book of pictures in an album, titled "My Dream Wedding." Inside were pictures of them getting married, surrounded by friends and family, including former friends of mine, in the back yard of my dream house. Everyone looked so happy. How could they all support her after what she did? 

I tossed the book away. Under it was one last document. It was a restraining order against me from James and Veronica Decker. I tore it up and walked out. I paid for my room and was able to rent a car. I needed to get out of this place, this town. I needed a fresh start. I got in my car, and sped away, trying to put this city behind me. Suddenly, blue and red lights flash behind me. 

"Fuck!" I yelled out to myself. I pulled the car over, and just started crying. Report_Story
