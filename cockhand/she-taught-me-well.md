She Taught Me Well
==================
#1 

===

I've heard it said that if you can remember the sixties, then you weren't really there. Well, I was 18 years old in 1964 and my memory is as clear as a bell. I freely admit that I was a naïve 18 year old – I'd never had any dealing with any of the mind altering substances that were in vogue throughout those heady years – I was still a virgin at my 18th birthday, which fell in February, and as that snowy, February day dawned there seemed little chance of the situation changing. 

'Morning Bernie.' I greeted my wrinkled colleague at the beginning of another work day some 3 months after my 18th celebration. 

'Morning lad,' he replied, as was his usual salutation. Bernie carried on folding the blankets that we used for wrapping around items of furniture that we collected and delivered on our travels around the North Yorkshire countryside. 

Bernie was the driver – and I was the driver's mate – of the panel van owned by an auction house that specialised in house clearances. He was only in his mid fifties, but looked at least a decade older. His wrinkly, weathered face, wild hair and unkempt appearance giving him a slightly forlorn, trampish look, a look that was more than a little deceptive since Bernie was in fact quite fastidious in his habits of personal hygiene. 

I knew a lot about Bernie, we got on well, which was fortunate considering the hours we spent in each other's company, cloistered together as we conducted our circuitous road trip of hill and dale. Bernie told and retold rich tales of his life and his loves, of which there were legion if the stories of his conquests were to be believed. It seemed that Bernie had enjoyed a wildly misspent youth, Friday and Saturday nights in pubs, and a seemingly inexhaustible number of willing, sex mad, women and girls who Bernie 'bucked' without fail. 

His tales from the war years were equally filled with female conquests, this time with lonely, frustrated wives of soldiers, sailors and airmen who had rather foolishly gone off to war, leaving their ladies high and dry. Bernie certainly kept up his war effort, 'I kept up morale back home,' he would grin at me, woodbine dangling from his lower lip as he spoke. 

I didn't know where all of these willing nymphomaniacs had gone to since I was lacking in the very area that Bernie was master, perhaps the female portion of my generation had developed some sort of high moral order? Whatever the reason, all I knew was that I wasn't getting any! 

'Nearly done lad,' Bernie said. 'Get in the van and we'll be off.' 

I climbed up into my familiar seat, packed my bag with my snap and flask into the gap between the seats and waited while Bernie slammed the rear door closed and climbed into the driver's seat. We rumbled along the roads on our way to the job of the day, a house clearance in a town named Malton, midway between York and Scarborough. 

Bernie parked in the driveway of the large victorian dwelling, we were a little early and had to wait for the owner to arrive with the keys. We didn't have long to wait, an elegant Jaguar pulled into the drive behind us just as we'd finished our first brew of the day. 

'Fuckin' ell,' I heard Bernie mutter under his breath. 'Look at this, lad,' Bernie nodded his head towards his side window. 

I was confused at first and then saw the reason for Bernie's remark as a mature blonde woman tapped on my door. From my position in the cab of the van I could look down into the woman's abundant cleavage as she stood impatiently awaiting my response. 

'Are you coming in then?' the woman's muffled voice blurred through the glass between us. She didn't wait for any answer, just turning and striding away, unlocking the heavy door to allow Bernie and I to take stock of our workload. 

With a practised eye, Bernie estimated 3 trips to clear the house of all its contents. Leaving the house with the van choc a bloc - dropping at the yard and then returning for another load - a full days work and probably more. 

The lady, Mrs Chambers, was a little cool with us at first, but warmed as Bernie used his cheeky chappie magic on her. I had to admit, that despite his appearance, he certainly seemed to have a way with the ladies. Initially, Mrs Chambers had appeared to be an ice queen, but by mid afternoon Bernie had her giggling coquettishly as he bombarded her with his jokes laden with sexual innuendo. 

'So you selling up then, love?' Bernie asked as Mrs Chambers brought in a tray with tea and biscuits for the workers. I cringed at Bernie's ungallant use of 'love' but Mrs Chambers merely smiled sweetly at him and placed the tray on an upturned tea chest. Mrs Chambers poured and we all settled around the makeshift table, I was looking forward to this welcome brew. 

'Yes,' Mrs Chambers replied to Bernie's question, her big bosom heaving as she sighed. 'My husband passed away 4 years ago and the place is just too big for me now,' she elaborated, saddened by the memory of her lost husband. 

'Must be lonely?' the ever sensitive Bernie responded. 

I thought he'd put his big foot right in it with that little gem but no, Mrs Chambers looked at him with moist eyes and merely replied, 'Yes it is, I do miss my husband terribly at times. Bernie sipped at his tea thoughtfully, the silence growing. 'But!' Mrs Chambers brightened, 'Life goes on, as they say.' 

'Aye, life goes on,' Bernie repeated Mrs Chambers's statement and, to my surprise winked at her. I saw a flush of pink rise from the mature woman's cleavage which crept up her elegant neck, colouring her cheeks a rosy hue. 

We finished the tea and biscuits and got on with our work as Mrs chambers cleared up the tray. 

'I bet she misses the old man,' Bernie said to me as we strapped a bookcase against the inside of the van. 'Misses the old sausage, that's what she misses,' he continued lewdly. 'Did you see the size of her jugs?' he grinned at me, smoke from his cigarette rising in front of his wizened face. 'An' her pins? Fine set of legs on the bird,' he shook his head in appreciation of Mrs Chambers indisputably fine assets. 

Bernie left me to finish the strapping and I followed him back into the house a few minutes later. 'Bernie!' I called when I didn't find the old man in the upstairs room we'd been working in. 

'Aye,' came his shout from downstairs in response. 'Just been to the lav, must be the tea,' he said entering the room. I thought nothing of it at the time, but there was a toilet directly across the landing from where we were working, but Bernie's craftiness went unnoticed. 

We unloaded the material history of Mrs Chambers married life into the store, locked up and parted for the night after we'd finished our second run of the day. We would be making our final journey back to Malton the following morning to complete the clearance of the big house. What a day it was going to be for me. 

Bernie was humming away to himself merrily as we drove along the A64. 'Why so happy, Bernie?' I asked. 

'Looking forward to seeing that Mrs Chambers,' he replied, giving me his grin and a wink. 'Don't you fancy a bit of that?' Bernie didn't wait for any reply, which was just as well since I'd gone scarlet with embarrassment. 'I'd be sniffing around her if I was a young lad, I can tell you,' he continued. 'Oh yes, sniffing round that like a dog round a bitch...' He tailed off, lost in reverie after his coarse remarks. 

Of course I fancied the mature Mrs Chambers, what red blooded male wouldn't? I just didn't have the gift of the gab like old Bernie. He seemed to have the knack all right, even though he wasn't any oil painting and the thawing of Mrs Chambers the previous day had proved his unfathomable charm. 

'I tried my luck yesterday you know.' I turned my disbelieving face towards Bernie after his little revelation. 'Didn't get too far,' he added, 'Seems she likes 'em a bit younger than me.' Bernie's face remained non committal and firmly fixed to the front as he steered the van along the road eastwards. 

Before I had much time to ponder over Bernie's veiled remark we pulled into Mrs Chambers drive, her Jaguar was already parked off to one side and the front door to the house was wide open. 

'Morning boys,' Mrs Chambers greeted us cheerily, the kettle boiling away in anticipation of our arrival. The ice queen had definitely thawed. 

Bernie and I worked steadily until early afternoon, pausing only to take a quick tea break before cracking on with the job in hand. Mrs Chambers helped to pack the tea chests with her crockery and ornaments, her close proximity at times made my nostrils twitch as I caught a waft of her scent. The smell of her perfume coupled with her grace and elegance made me feel awkward in her presence, oafish and clumsy. I took surreptitious glances at her generous bosom as her blouse gaped from time to time as she bent to lower a carefully wrapped, newspaper bound packet into a tea chest. 

There came a point where Bernie was out in the van moving bits and pieces around like a jigsaw to ensure that we could fit everything in. Mrs Chambers and I were on one of our little wrapping jaunts, working close together in what had been her bedroom. 

'Your friend is quite a devil isn't he?' Mrs Chambers said to me. 

I didn't know how to respond to such a direct question. I didn't possess the confidence or self assurance and I was more than a little confused by the line the woman was taking. 

'Don't worry,' laughed Mrs Chambers mistaking my discomfort and confusion for loyalty. 'I'm not angry with him or anything. I can see that he's a bit of a charmer, a bit of a ladies man,' she continued. 'I should imagine the 2 of you have chalked up plenty of conquests between you.' I reddened noticeably at her sexual reference. 

Mrs Chambers saw my colour and paused, studying me intently. 'Oh my,' she said quietly. I do believe I've touched a bit of a nerve there.' She was teasing me, adding to my confusion, my red face bushing scarlet now. 

Mrs Cambers ceased her wrapping and moved closer to me. She was so close I could smell her scent and feel the heat from her body. It was a beautiful, warm May day, warm enough to warrant the wearing of only a t shirt with Mrs Chambers was wearing a light cotton blouse. A combination of the warmth of the day, combined with the proximity of Mrs Chambers healthy body caused me to break into a mild sweat. 

'You've never had a woman, have you?' whispered into my ear. In spite of my confusion the very atmosphere caused my cock to stiffen, the sound of Mrs Chambers refined voice, her breath on my cheek as she whispered the sudden charge of sexual tension meant that my body reacted even before my brain could properly register what was going on. 

'You're friend tried to kiss me yesterday,' her whispering voice said. 'He's a funny man, makes me laugh, but he's not what I'm searching for.' 

Her words puzzled me. Searching for? What does that mean, I thought to myself. 

Mrs Chambers kissed me on the cheek, a touch so light, like a bird's wing and then she moved away from me when Bernie's footsteps could be heard on the stairs. 

Bernie noticed my flushed face, but said nothing. Mrs Chambers looked completely innocent as she carried on wrapping. I was completely and utterly bemused by what had just occurred, it felt like a dream, I didn't know what to do or how to act. What did Mrs Chambers expect from me? Realisation that she could just be teasing me dawned, but somehow that didn't strike me as her style, as artless as I was I somehow knew that Mrs Chambers wasn't the teasing type. Well, perhaps she would tease, but only as part of the whole game, never for her own amusement. 

I closed the doors to the van when the last item from the big house was safely inside. Mrs Chambers locked the door to the now empty house. 'Thank you boys,' she said to us as we stood, Bernie expectantly. 'Here's a little something for you both,' Mrs Chambers had anticipated Bernie's expectation perfectly so it seemed. She handed us a small white envelope each. 

'Thanks very much, love,' Bernie responded with typical ungallant directness. Mrs Chambers laughed as Bernie gave her a cheeky grin and a wink. 'Anytime,' he concluded. 

The envelopes contained £5 each, a very generous tip indeed with £5 being worth a weeks wage to me in those days. In addition to the bank note, my envelope also held a small, neatly folded square of notepaper, upon which was written – I will be in the Station Hotel, York on Saturday afternoon. I would be very pleased if you could meet me for a farewell drink in the bar at 4pm – it was signed with a single initial 'G'. 

'Fuckin' ell, son,' Bernie whistled when I showed him the note. 'You're in there!' he said enviously. 

'What do I do, Bernie?' I asked, totally unsure as to how to proceed and looking to my friend for some guidance. 

'Go to the hotel on bloody Saturday,' he snorted uselessly. 

I was in turmoil; today was Thursday, more than a whole day before the rendezvous. I wasn't even sure that I'd meet the divine Mrs Chambers, one moment I was determined to make the visit and the next; I was caught up in dread anticipation as I was assailed by doubts. There was no way I could satisfy the sophisticated, mature, elegant lady. I was too raw, too green to possibly be able to hold her attention, what would we even talk about? She would be bored rigid by my mumblings and my bumbling, small town manner would wither with embarrassment under her experienced gaze. 

No - I wouldn't be keeping that appointment – definitely. 

I walked into the Railway Hotel just before 4pm on the Saturday. I was wearing my best suit, in fact it was my only suit, my hair was neat, I was freshly bathed and in addition to all this cleanliness... I was nervous as hell. 

I found the bar and saw her straight away. Mrs Chambers was sitting elegantly aloof on one of the chesterfields situated in a quiet corner of the hushed room. There were only a couple of other people in the bar, so there was no chance for me to slip away unnoticed now that my nerve was failing. 

Mrs Chambers saw me and beamed a radiant smile across the room at me. She waved at me to join her on the sumptuous leather settee. 

'What is your name, dear?' she asked as I sat next to her. 

'Simon,' I answered, my voice faltering as I croaked a reply. 

'Pleased to meet you, Simon,' Mrs Chambers said formally. I shook the proffered hand that she daintily offered. 'You must call me Gillian, or Gill if you prefer,' Mrs Chambers answered the question of the 'G' as was signed on her note to me. 

Drinks arrived unasked for, Mrs Chambers, or Gillian as she preferred, sipped at her white wine and I gingerly tested the whisky that was placed in front of me. 

'I feel it's such a man's drink,' Gillian said, referring to the golden liquid in my glass. I wasn't a great fan of spirits as it happened, but I had no wish to insult my host and sipped some more of the fiery spirit. 

'Thank you for coming,' Gillian spoke in a low voice and slid closer to me on the soft cushioned seat. 'I expect you're wondering just why I invited you,' Gillian stated the obvious. 

'Well... yes, I was wondering...' I answered, suddenly finding my voice. Perhaps the whisky was making me bold. 

Suddenly, perhaps now that she was defending her motives, Gillian seemed a little unsure of herself. The perfectly poised façade was showing signs of crumbling. 'I'm leaving soon,' Gillian explained hesitantly. 'I sail for Australia in 2 days, there's nothing here for me anymore and I thought about having a little farewell party for myself. 

'So who else is coming?' I asked in a moronic moment. 

Gillian laughed and her mood lightened abruptly, her confidence and poise returned. 'Only you're invited, darling,' she said huskily, placing a hand on my thigh. I looked at Gillian's hand on my leg, noticing the jewelled rings and painted nails that adorned her cool fingers. The sound of her voice and pressure of her hand awakened my penis and it uncurled slowly, just as it had done during at Gillian's whispered words in the old house. 'You really don't know why I asked you here... not properly, do you?' she asked. I looked into Gillian's blue eyes, 'I want to do something wild and decadent before I leave for my new life and I've decided on you.' 

I was speechless and took a big swallow of the whisky, forgetting just how strong the liquid was in my surprise. No sooner had I placed the empty glass down on the coaster, than the waiter appeared with a fresh one. 

'You've no idea how much it took me to write that note, Simon. I had to think long and hard about it, I took a big risk... I had no idea whether or not you'd show...' she said, suddenly vulnerable again, the veil of confidence slipping slightly. 

She made a decision; I could almost see her resolve hardening as she spoke. 'Come on, let's go to my suite, we can talk in private there,' Gillian downed the remnants of her wine and I was forced to throw the hot contents of the tumbler down my throat as Gillian picked up her purse and led me from the bar. 

As soon as we entered her suite Gillian was at me, all pretence of social politeness blown away. She pushed me against the inside of the door and pushed her voluptuous body against me. 'Kiss me,' she commanded, pushing her painted mouth hard against mine. I felt her tongue prising between my lips and I opened my mouth to accommodate her. 

Gillian was moaning deep in her throat as she kissed me, she was like a wild animal, her tongue invading my mouth, twisting and snaking around my own tongue in a serpentine dance as she held my face in her hands and pushed her big bosom against my chest. 

'Oh God, I do want a virgin, please tell me you're a virgin,' Gillian breathed at me when she broke the kiss. I nodded and Gillian closed her eyes and sighed at that silent confirmation. 'Thank you... thank you,' she sighed. 'You're the first reckless thing I've done in my life,' she said stepping back, holding on to my hands as she stood almost at arms length. 'I married so young,' she continued wistfully. 'So young, and I was such a faithful and dutiful wife,' the monologue continued. 'I've had one man in my life - just one - and it's now been four years since I've been held, been kissed... I saw you the other day... so young... your blushing, ...oh God, I don't know...' 

Gillian seemed desperate for me to understand and although I had a glimmering of how she must have felt at that time, it wasn't until years later that I fully understood the reasons for Gillian's actions. She was carving a new life for herself; moving across the world for a new start and in leaving the old ways behind, she'd decided to take a young lover for the night. The reasons for her decision were myriad, marrying young, the curiosity of what it would be like to be intimate with another man, add to that her sexual frustration after four years abstinence - the list went on and on. 

This night would be a journey of discovery for us both. For me the first time of knowing a woman intimately and for Gillian, it would be a journey matched in equal measure, a discovery of opening doors, with the firm closing of others as she bid her old life goodbye. 

She turned away from me then and walked into the suite. 'Come here lover,' she beckoned. I was powerless to resist - I didn't want to resist and I let the mature, infinitely more experienced woman, albeit her experience being singular, take control. I walked to her, Gillian locking her gaze with mine as she unbuttoned my trousers. My erection was sudden and all consuming, as I felt Gillian fumble with the buttons and I felt a surge of affection as I noticed her bottom lip held between her white teeth as she focussed her concentration on that obstinate sliver of metal. 

With a cry of triumph Gillian unbuttoned me and pulled my trousers down low enough that my cock sprang out, thick and terrible in it's stiffness. 'Oh my,' Gillian said in appreciation. 'My, oh my, oh my... we do have a very fine specimen here.' She touched my inflamed cock with her hand and I almost hit the ceiling at her cool touch.  

===

I groaned as I felt her fingers envelop my shaft, never before had another person handled my cock in a sexual way and it was a sublime moment for me. I had dreamt and fantasised about this day and here it was at last. I was going to lose my virginity, not only that but I was giving it to a voluptuous, mature, beautiful woman; a woman who would take her time with me, who would unwrap each act that we enjoyed together as though each one was a gift to be cherished. I would cleave to the memory of this night with Gillian, pulling the memory from it's box often over the coming years and savouring the images, the fondly remembered textures and tastes, the scents and the sounds of her before I packed the memory away once again into its velvet lined box. 

Although I didn't know at that time, she was the perfect one to show me the secrets of a woman's body, how to kiss and lick parts of her that I would never have dreamt were erogenous, how to manipulate her tender, intimate places with fingers and tongue, how to bring her pleasure and perhaps the most important lesson of the night; putting that pleasure before my own. 

'You like that, darling?' Gillian's whispered question brought me back to her. 

'Oh yes, Mrs Chambers,' I replied, gulping and nodding as she continued to fondle me. 

'Gillian, please; call me Gillian,' she reminded me. 'Mrs Chambers makes me sound so old darling,' pouted the mature blonde. I didn't really know just how old Gillian was at the time, but I've figured it out since, my lover was 49 the afternoon she wanked my prick in that suite. 

She was a fantastic 49 however, well maintained and excellently presented, and she was still magnificent when she was stood before me, stripped of her clothes, wearing just her shoes, stockings and basque. My gaze was captivated by her big, wobbling breasts as she scooped them from the cups of the basque, the areola of each as big as a saucer and her button shaped nipples were like bullets, betraying her arousal in spite of her earlier waver along the path of self confidence. 

'Fucking hell,' I muttered as Gillian revealed herself in all her ripe magnificence. She had picked the definitive moment in her life in which to abandon her propriety. The years had been kind to Gillian, her breasts were pendulous but not sagging, her waist had thickened and her belly was rounded and soft, but not yet flabby. She was on the cusp of a physical decline and I hate to sound cruel or sexist, for that is not my intent, but Gillian would not be able to maintain her abundant charms for much longer, time would perhaps be her enemy. 

Gillian smiled at my obscenity. 'I'll take that as a compliment,' she said, hands on broad hips. 

I stood, transfixed by her near nakedness, the shoes and lingerie heightening the eroticism and fuelling my desire for Gillian. My eyes were drawn to the obvious. I had never seen breasts before, other than in pictures of course, but here were a magnificent example right before my eyes. I looked at the junction of Gillian's stocking clad thighs and took in the sight of her pubic bush. Although the hair on her head was a dyed blonde, her natural colour couldn't have been dark because the hair that barely masked her vulva was a light, smoky brown. 

'Well, you've seen me, I do believe it's your turn now.' Gillian's voice brought my eyes back up to her face. 'I feel a little exposed here darling,' 

With trembling hands I pulled my trousers the remaining distance down to my ankles, kicked off my shoes and stepped free. I unbuttoned my shirt and removed my tie with fingers that felt as huge as sausages and I stood in front of Gillian blushing hotly, my penis still stiff and waggling in front of me as it jutted keenly from my lower belly. 

'Erm...' Gillian pointed at my feet. I looked down woodenly and saw my feet still covered by my black socks. Blushing even harder I pulled the socks off as Gillian giggled privately at my gaffe. 

'I'm sorry baby,' she said in a mothering tone. 'I shouldn't laugh at you; you must be petrified. I'm as nervous as hell too... Please forgive me.' 

Gillian walked towards me, breasts jiggling sexily. She kissed me again, a real, tender, lover's kiss. I was captivated as she held me and I put my arms around her body pulling her close, feeling her big, squashy melons press against my chest. 

The kiss became more passionate as our bodies met, turning from a moment of tenderness to one of urgent lust. My prick, which had been on the wane, once more grew savagely hard instantly. 

'Fuck,' I hissed through gritted teeth as Gillian once again took me in hand. She peeled my tight foreskin back to reveal the rounded dome of my cock head. She slowly manipulated me in her hand, pressing her breasts against me firmly and kissing me at the same time. 

My senses couldn't register everything that was happening to me at once. The glorious rush from my shaft began after only a few moments of Gillian's touch. My hot seed spurted from my cock, taking Gillian completely by surprise as her basque was spattered with the thick, white goo. 

'Oh!' she exclaimed as the fierce jets gushed from me. 

'I'm sorry... I'm sorry,' I sobbed. I was sobbing partly from the intensity of the release my spunking cock was giving me. I'd been anticipating this moment for what seemed like an age. I hadn't masturbated since Gillian's note and I had been aching for relief. 

'That's ok honey,' Gillian cooed. 'I suppose it only means you like me,' she said, my cum sliding down the cotton front of her white basque. She wiped the leaking eye of my prick against her stocking top as my semen was still leaking from me and then turned her back to me, showing the hooks that held the garment closed. 'Unhook me,' she instructed and I set about undoing the delicate hooks and eyes. 

Gillian was soon naked; her stained basque, stockings and suspender belt discarded. Her shoes carelessly kicked into a corner. She took me lovingly by the hand and led me from the sitting room into the bedroom. 

'You're still stiff,' Gillian pointed at my cock. 

'Yes,' I replied, puzzled. 

'Well you've come; I thought it would disappear. Young men are supposed to have stamina, but I didn't expect you to stay erect like this.' 

I shrugged my shoulders; I had often been able to have 2 orgasms on the bounce, 3 if I was aroused enough. I wasn't surprised my prick didn't want to lie down; this was my first taste of the hitherto forbidden fruit of sex. I was excited and aroused beyond comparison and I felt I would be able to piston into Gillian's lush body for hours with my erection staying solid. 

'Let me taste you.' The words stunned me for a moment. 

Gillian took hold of my shaft as she sat on the edge of the bed; she pulled me close and her blonde head ducked. I felt her warm breath on my cock and then, magically, I felt her tongue glide slickly over the huge helmet, teasing it wetly before she licked the sides of my cock from tip to balls. 

'My husband loved this,' Gillian grinned up at me, my penis gripped tightly in her fist. 

'It's fantastic Mrs Chambers,' I groaned, reverting to the formal reference. She let it pass and returned to her task in hand so to speak, sucking on me and wanking my root at the same time. 

Gillian appeared to take a lot of pleasure from the giving of it. She was making soft groaning sounds as she sucked and licked at me, sighing and breathing heavily whenever my prick was loose from between her lips. 'It's been so long,' she whispered, almost to herself as she paused in her sucking, concentrating her efforts into manipulating my thickness with her hand. 'I love it; so stiff, so thick.' Gillian kissed the tip tenderly. 'I want you inside me baby,' she said, looking upwards again and piercing me with those blue eyes. 

Gillian released my cock and pushed herself back along the bed. I stood, my thick prick waving in front of me. 'Come here,' Gillian beckoned, lying on her back and spreading her thighs, and I wasted no time as I clambered onto the spongy, soft bed and knelt between Gillian's legs. 

My lover's fingers parted the crinkly folds of her labia and exposed the pink opening of her sex to me, another revelation for my eyes to drink in. I watched as Gillian's fingers moved in lazy circles around and around and I saw what appeared to be a thick nub of flesh that was nestling beneath a little hood at the top of Gillian's vulva. She was paying a lot of attention to this nub, rubbing it with her the tips of her fingers, and actually squeezing it gently as though it was a small cock. Of course the fleshy nubbin was her clitoris, a part of a woman I am on intimate terms with now, but about whose existence I was completely ignorant of in those early days. 

'Lick me... Oh God! Please... Lick me... I can't stand it.' Gillian was panting and groaning, her face contorting as she used the fingers from her free hand inside her tunnel, frigging herself. 

I lay down, my face inches away from Gillian's body. She took hold of my face in hands that were slick with her wetness and literally pulled me against her sex. Not knowing quite what to do, I took a tentative lap at her with my tongue. I could smell the musk of her excitement and the smell and the heat of her arousal sent a surge of lust through me. It was an animal urge, a reversion to instinct. I was almost overwhelmed by the need to stab Gillian with my aching cock, to pound at her mercilessly and flood her insides with my seed. 

It was at that point that Gillian began to instruct me, about how I had to keep control of my own urges and to give the woman pleasure. She taught me that the longer I was able to hold myself back, that the more I could give her with skilful use of fingers and tongue, then the greater intensity my own release would have when I reached my own climax. 

Gillian's whispered instructions about where to lick and where to probe, accompanied by her sighs and moans of pleasure over the course of the following minutes and hours were an invaluable boost to my sexual education. I have used the lessons I learnt from the precious Gillian many times over the years, her words and guidance were priceless. 

'My clit baby, on my clit.' Gillian's thighs were clenching and quivering, her hips rising as she arched her back, lifting her buttocks clear of the bed. I had been at Gillian for what seemed an age, my jaw ached, the little flap of skin beneath my tongue was tender from rubbing against my bottom teeth and my lips were actually beginning to chafe with Gillian's constant flow of juice. 

But now I knew what was happening; Gillian had already climaxed at my oral attention, more than once, and I could feel her revving up for another. She was very vocal when she came; her choice of language had shocked me at first, the cultured, well spoken lady was replaced by a sewer mouthed slut. 

Gillian's climax hit her as I tongued her clit hard, as she'd instructed me to do at this point earlier on during our session. 'Fuck...Oh Fuck!' she cried out. 'That's so good... Oh yes, so good. I'm pissing cum... You lovely bastard.' Gillian shuddered, her eyes squeezed tight, her nipples puckered with desire as her big breasts wobbled, her orgasm surging through her quivering body. 

Still panting and with her chest and face flushed from the exertion, Gillian pushed her body underneath mine until I was lying full length on top of her. Her make up was destroyed, her hair in ruins, she looked to be the epitome of wanton sluttiness, a woman desperate for cock. I pushed myself up on extended arms and looked down at her as, with single minded determination, Gillian reached down between our bodies and guided the head of my prick to her opening. 

My moment had arrived. I paused, feeling the heat from Gillian's body and, with a simple push; I slid into her welcoming, liquid core. 

I was finally inside a woman, the feeling was sublime as I slid deeper and deeper, and her insides parted as I cleaved her with my cock. 

'Yes!' she hissed, her voice filled with the satisfaction. 'It's been so long Simon. Four years since I've had a cock. God... I've missed it more than I knew.' My lover whispered to me before she began to move her hips beneath me. 'Come on... Fuck me,' she was using the obscenity again. 'I want you hard and fast lover. Pound my cunt. Come on... Fuck me.' 

I was shocked by her choice of phrase, but was turned on by the contrasts within this creature. Demure, polished and refined in public, and a harlot when intimate. 

I did as she commanded. I pulled my thick cock almost free and then slammed back into her, our bodies slapping together. I hooked Gillian's legs high over my shoulders and continued to bang at her, altering the angle of my penetration so the friction from my pistoning cock was different with each stroke. It was a good technique; Gillian went berserk, her fists gripping the bed sheets, pulling the bed apart as we fucked. She raked her nails down my back, opening bloody welts along my body. I would carry those scars for weeks, a constant reminder, and a trophy from my night with Gillian. 

It didn't take long before Gillian was winding up for another climax. I was using one hand to maul at her breasts as I fucked her, occasionally lowering my face to her soft tit flesh and suckling her distended teats. 

'I'm going to come Simon,' she wailed loudly. 'I'm... Going... To... Fucking... COME!!' 

'Mrs Chambers, oh fuck...' I groaned as I felt Gillian's insides twitch tightly around my cock and, as my heaving lover climaxed around my prick, I pumped my seed into her body. 

Her eyes opened wide as she felt me gushing into her. 'It's so hot! I can feel you coming,' she smiled up at me from the pillow before throwing her head back and emitting a long, drawn out groan. 

Her orgasm subsided and my cock stopped spitting. I pulled out of Gillian's body and saw the shaft of my cock covered with the goo of our combined outpourings. Gillian was perspiring as she lay inelegantly on top of the ravaged bed, legs thrown wide, her pussy oozing. 

My cock was still stiff, the sight of Gillian in such a bedraggled state merely stoked the fire of my desire and I wanted more of her. 'Jesus,' she blasphemed when she saw my unflagging prick. 'Where do you get the stamina? You're insatiable.' 

I grinned at her. 'I want to fuck you more Mrs Chambers,' waving my sticky cock at her. My confidence had grown ten fold and I wanted to have my glorious lover impaled on my shaft again. 

Gillian heaved herself upright on the bed and then rolled over, resting on her elbows and knees, her big, well rounded backside high in the air. 'From behind; take me from behind.' She wriggled her hips seductively at me in invitation. 

I needed no second bidding, kneeling behind her I pushed my cock head at her vulva and split her sticky labia as my prick invaded her body once more. 'Ah!' sighed Gillian as I gripped her broad hips tightly, digging my fingers into her flesh as my stiffness probed deeply. 

There was less sensation this time, probably because Gillian's cunt was greasy with my first load of spunk, but it still felt gloriously hot and I could feel her internal muscles squeezing me as I fucked into her. 

Gillian was pushing back against my thrusting, her buttocks wobbling as we slapped together. I crouched low over her back and reached below so I could hold her heavy, swinging tits in my hands. I cupped the heavy globes in my palms, savouring their weight. The tempo of my thrusting increased as my ardour grew and I mauled and squeezed at Gillian's breasts, the soft flesh spilling out of my hands as I tried to contain them in my grasping fingers. 

'Fuck me like a bitch... Go on fuck me,' Gillian was building towards yet another climax. 'Squeeze my tits and pound my cunt,' she was swearing again. The obscenities pouring from her in such cultured tones turned me on to fever pitch and I was close to coming too. 

'You like that, don't you; you fucking slut.' I responded to Gillian's filth with some of my own, leaving her breasts and slapping her wobbling arse cheeks. 

'Yes! Yes! I fucking love it!' she cried, pushing back against me with more force now. 

I smacked Gillian's bottom several more times until it glowed pink and then I couldn't contain myself any longer. I gripped her hips tightly and pushed my cock deep, as far as I could manage into her accommodating body. My spunk poured out of me again and I sobbed with the pleasure of it as I filled my lover's already sopping cunt. 

Gillian came with less vehemence this time and slowly slid down to the bed as her climax died down, with me lying on top of her full length. 

She rolled from under me and onto her side, looking at me tenderly. We kissed gently as we both took a few moments to recover. My heart was pounding in my chest and my cock was finally wilting, shrivelling to its normal size. My prick was tender from the furious pounding I'd been giving Gillian and it was a little red and inflamed. 

'How do you feel?' Gillian asked concerned, obviously knowing she had taken my virginity. 

'Fantastic,' I replied. 'Absolutely fantastic; you are so beautiful...' My voice trailed off. No words were really adequate for what I was feeling. 

I think I was falling a little in love with the mature Mrs Chambers. She still has a hold over me; even to this day, years later and if she hadn't disappeared from my life the next day I fear that she would have become an obsession. As it was I was perhaps more upset than could have been expected by her departure, perhaps I was a little over sensitive, but my first time was certainly memorable and I do owe Mrs Chambers and enormous debt of thanks. I marvel still at the timing, all the factors involved that caused the fates to conspire together in such a way that meant that such a divine woman picked that time, picked me for her moment of madness. 

Gillian, perhaps sensing that I was a little over emotional, giggled and leapt out of bed as spry as a schoolgirl. 'Let's take a bath,' she suggested. 'I need to bathe,' she continued as she ran her middle finger along her pouting labia in an act of lewdness that caused my cock to twitch again. 

We spent a happy half an hour splashing in the steaming, scented water of the huge bath tub I took every opportunity to feel Gillian's soft, white skin, soaping her magnificent breasts, rinsing them clean and then kissing her wet skin. 

By the time we towelled dry with the thick, soft towels provided by the hotel, my cock was once again showing signs of interest at Gillian's newly scented nakedness. 'Down, boy,' she laughed when he saw my arousal. 'Let's eat; I'm famished. Then we can come back and you can fuck me again and again with that lovely, untiring prick of yours.' Gillian kissed me and gave my tender cock a gentle squeeze before she turned and left me standing docilely in the warm bathroom. 

After a romantic dinner at a nearby restaurant Gillian and I were sat on our original chesterfield in the hotel bar. My enchanting host had downed about three quarters of a bottle of white wine and was pleasantly intoxicated. She was draped across me on the sofa, uncaring whether or not we were seen and the close proximity of her had my cock uncomfortably stiff within the confines of my trousers. 

'I can feel Mr Stiffy,' Gillian grinned at me, the wine making her giggle. 'Take me upstairs and fuck me,' she continued, whispering into my ear. 

We went back up to her suite and no sooner had the door closed than Gillian was kissing me passionately. I had a feeling of déjà vu, the circumstances were a repetition of our first entry into the suite earlier that afternoon. The difference now, however was that I had grown in confidence and was returning my lover's kiss eagerly. 

I ran my hands over Gillian's voluptuous curves, cupping her breasts and squeezing her buttocks as my cock threatened to burst free from its prison.

I broke the kiss; this time I was taking control. I led Gillian to the bedroom and slowly undressed her, kissing her skin, as each glorious part of her was unveiled. Once she was nude, Gillian stood completely at ease under my scrutiny, her hands on her broad hips as she thrust her mons forward, almost arrogantly, as though challenging me. 

I took up the challenge and stripped hurriedly, once again my thick penis jutted stiffly in front of me, as though sniffing the air expectantly. 

I licked Gillian to a noisy climax; using my newfound skills that Gillian's earlier coaching had shown me. Before the tide of her orgasm had had time to recede I licked and probed at her sopping sex once more to bring her to yet another peak. I used my tongue and fingers on her hard clit, pushing them deep into her opening as I strove to satisfy my lover. 

I positioned Gillian on the bed so that she was lying on her side, with me then taking up a position behind her. I pulled her hips into me and introduced my prick to her opening from behind. Gillian gasped as I fed my iron hard cock into her, and I paused for a moment before I began to slide in and out. The graceful curve of Gillian's spine and the line of her hip captivated me as I fucked into her as we spooned. 

I kissed the back of Gillian's neck and was rewarded by her deep, throaty growl of contentment. 'Oh yes baby, that's so nice. Make love to me... Please, just love me.' 

I probed deep into Gillian's body as I took her gently and slowly. I was savouring the sensations along my shaft as I made sweet, tender love to the woman who had initiated me into this heady realm. 

I had a sudden urge to increase my thrusting when Gillian held herself up on her elbow. I could now reach under her and touch her big breasts. I mauled once again at Gillian's ample tits and I began to pump into her harder and faster, feeling the softness of her globes in my hands. 

'Fuck, Gillian... You're fucking tight on my cock,' I groaned. I had dropped the 'Mrs Chambers' by now and was getting used to calling her by her Christian name. I began to bite at the nape of Gillian's neck as my lust for her grew and I wrapped my arms around her torso so I could pull her more sharply onto my thrusting cock. 

'Yes... It's good... Pound me. Go on; fuck me. Make me come.' Gillian was becoming more and more excited as we writhed together on the big bed. She opened her legs, throwing her thigh over mine. Now she had easy access, and could reach down between her legs to manipulate her clitoris manually. I could feel her nails catching on the underside of my cock as she fingered her herself frantically. 

When her third climax began I felt Gillian's cunt contract around my cock again, and I spunked yet another load of my semen into her. I grunted like I was wounded as my pulsing cock spat jets of thick goo against Gillian's womb and I grabbed her wildly swinging tits as I poured my love into her. 

Gillian and I made love for most of that night, sleeping when the dawn's early light brushed gently at the heavily curtained window. My stamina hadn't diminished throughout the night and I came twice more during the course of our lovemaking. The final time of coming I covered Gillian's face and breasts with my diminishing volume of semen and I felt it's sticky wetness against my chest, Gillian cuddling close into me as we eventually slept. 

My stomach was sinking with despair when I stood on the station platform later on that afternoon. Gillian waved at me as the big diesel engined deltic locomotive powered its train of carriages south, taking Gillian on towards London and away from me forever. Report_Story
