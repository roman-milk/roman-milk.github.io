GA - Antigua, Guatemala. 10th May 2012. 

* 

They were in the wrong part of town at night. In a wood and tarpaper shack, a dingy confined space of a place well away from the bright lights, the security of the tourist strip, the hawkers and touts, bars, and a policeman. A low beat of perpetual reggae throbbed dimly through the fragrant miasma that clung to the low ceiling. The only lighting came from a triple series of ancient disco lights which suffused the smoky haze with alternate blushes of colour. Red Stripe and rum bottles littered the scarred and stained plank that served as a bar counter, while a scarred and stained man wearing a ratty sleeveless vest served up replacement beverages from a fridge that seen neither cloth nor disinfectant for a decade or more. 

The girl sat on a plastic chair, knees together, head bowed, hands folded in her lap as though at prayer. A sweating bottle of Red Stripe sat in a saucer- sized pool of water, almost untouched in front of her. Dutch blonde and pretty she kept her blue eyes focussed on the bottle's peeling label while her husband of two days surveyed the bar with an outward show of calm confidence he didn't feel. 

The girl's eyes flicked sideways, which had been her only physical movement for a full three minutes. Out of the corner of her mouth she muttered: 'I didn't expect this. When he said a bar, I thought he meant one on the strip. Not this ...' Her head jerked, the meaning clear: Where are we? How are we going to get out of here? ... Alive. Everything about her, her posture, her gaze locked on the bottle on the plastic picnic table, immobility -- if she just stayed still, didn't move, ignored everything around her then it would all just go away - - screamed fear. She added: 'It all seemed like a good idea at the pool. Now look at us.' 

Anxiety squeezed the man's chest. What was she complaining about? It was her idea. The guy had approached them as they lay next to the pool, secure inside the hotel complex. Gold-toothed charm, a woollen tea-cosy hat bulging with dreads, and a typically laid-back air, he'd convinced the honeymooners to come out to a local joint he knew. 

'Away from the expensive places,' he'd drawled, toning down the patois for their unaccustomed ears. 'The tourist places ...' He sucked air through his teeth and shook his head. 'Sky high prices.' The gold eye tooth glinted in the sun as he smiled. They arranged a time, and here they were after a giddying, circuitous, and disorientating jalopy ride, afraid and confused in some local shebeen. Their guide, following a brief discourse with a group of locals at the bar, explained he'd be away for a few minutes and left. 

'A couple of beers,' her husband assured her, his voice low, beneath the bass thump from the speakers. 'Then, if Linus doesn't come back we'll just ask for a lift back to the strip.' He shrugged and offered a tentative, nervous smile. 'Or maybe they'll call us a cab,' he added hopefully. 

The girl's head swivelled slowly. She regarded her husband, face pinched with concern. 'They look like Yardies,' she hissed. 

'I'm sure they're not gangsters,' the man replied. 

'They look fucking dangerous, Daniel.' His wife's terse response surprised him. She wasn't given to profanity. He wondered how badly she'd been upset by this excursion. 

Three men dressed in faded jeans and vests of various colours stood at the bar, elbows on the counter, backs to the nervous couple. Two of them held burning cigarettes that gave off a pungent, suspect odour, the smoke rising to the low ceiling, thickening the blanket of fugue overhead. The three were all youngish, mid-twenties, athletically muscular, two of whom sported the ubiquitous dreadlocks while the other wore his hair short. One of them, the close-shorn one, turned to regard the pair briefly. A conspiratorial chuckle came from the other two after some mumbled comment. The man detached himself from what was obviously his habitual position, biceps bulging, triceps tensing as he pushed his angled torso away from the bar. 

'Evening,' he grinned, eyes all over the girl's body after sauntering slide- footed and insouciant to the table. 

The woman tensed, sensing his appraisal rather than seeing. She kept her eyes on the bottle in front of her. Her husband returned a timid hello, his eyes sliding over the other man's grinning face, seeing the challenge there but powerless to react. He ignored the blatant assessment of his wife's d√©colletage. Now wasn't the time to play the knight in shining armour. 

The man loomed over the couple, dark-skinned and rangy, unsettling the pale- skinned visitors, his smile sinister despite its breadth. 'We don't get many tourists in here,' he offered ambiguously in what could be either comment or threat. 

The girl said nothing while her husband, equally silent, blinked quickly several times at this opening gambit. 'Uh ...' he began. 'It was recommended by Linus.' He used the name in the hope of a positive response. This didn't feel good at all. If he could engender some favour by dropping a familiar name all to the good. 

The man's response remained ambiguous. 'Yeah,' he said, his gaze fixed on the woman. Then, suddenly, he turned his attention to the nervous man seated. 'We don't get many white people in here at all ... ever ...' He smirked, adding: 'And we never get pretty white girls payin' us no visits.' 

'We just got married,' the husband blurted. 'Two days ago.' 

The man's smile widened. He turned to his companions at the bar, both of whom were leaning on one elbow, watching the scene unfold. 'Got a pair of honeymooners,' he called. 

The barman slopped a desultory cloth over the counter and made no comment. 

One of his customers spoke, the one in the green vest. 'Calls for a celebration,' he said, 'bottle of rum.' This last was offered to the man behind the bar, who ceased his slovenly ministrations and bent forward to lift a bottle from under the counter. 

'Oh, no, that isn't necessary,' the husband began. 'Linus should be back soon,' he suggested, more than a little hopefully. 'And we really don't drink spirits ...' 

'Just a little drink to celebrate,' Green Vest said. 'Linus said he'd be a half hour ... maybe a little more. He's on an errand for me.' He grabbed the bottle by its neck and ambled to the table. 'Just a drop,' he finished. 

The third man brought five more bottles of beer, while the barman delivered glasses, carrying his cargo one-handed on a tray. Chairs scraped through the dust on the wooden floor, bottles thunked onto the table top. Daniel suddenly found himself positioned on the periphery of the group, with his wife, as the focal point, flanked either side by the two long-haired locals, the man with short hair interposed between Daniel and the main group. 

'You're a mighty lucky man,' the short-haired one said, leering sideways at Daniel. 'That's a very pretty girl you got yourself.' He nodded appreciatively. 'Sweet,' he added. 

The woman stared at her husband, her eyes beseeching. She could feel the heat coming from the two men positioned so closely at her sides, could smell their bodies. Inwardly cursing her trembling hand she picked up the bottle which had held her attention for so long. She swigged deeply, chugging half the contents in one go. 'Cuh ... could you call a taxi,' she stammered. 'Please. I'd like to leave now. Daniel, could you ask for a phone to call a cab?' 

The man to her left spoke, the one in the green vest, the one who'd suggested the rum. 'Hey,' he said softly, shaking his head, lips pursed. 'No need to run away,' he purred, voice like silk, smile like a tiger's. 'We just wanna celebrate with you. Toast your good fortune.' His eyes slithered across the woman's chest. 'Toast your husband's luck.' He leered at the girl. 'Lucky fellah,' he said. 'What you say, Danny? You gonna take a little drink with us? Your new friends here.' 

Daniel vacillated, sensing that to refuse might invite an angry response. 'Uh,' he said, 'I don't suppose ...' He looked at his wife, willed her to understand. 'Just one drink?' he suggested, his smile tepid. 

Rum was poured and glasses chinked. 'Cheers,' Green Vest said, grinning his huge grin, obviously the leader of the group. 

The girl demurred. 'No, thank you,' she said, seething inside and silently cursing her husband. 'I don't like rum.' She tilted the beer bottle against her lips and drained it. Then, the empty bottle banging the table like a gavel, she lifted her second. 'Cheers,' she toasted through clenched teeth, her eyes flashing fire towards Daniel. 

'Rum,' the short-haired man suggested, pouring generous measures into four glasses without waiting for any motion of acceptance from Daniel. 

Watching her husband, the new Mrs Bartholomew felt humiliation and anger corrode her guts. He should have refused, she thought. He should have acted when I told him to call a cab. These men are taking the piss and he's just going along with it. She burned with indignation. I should've insisted, she reasoned. Stood my ground, made my point and fucking demanded to leave. Clara chided herself: I should have stood up and just left. This is getting stupid now. Look at him sucking up to these fuckers. She began to question her husband's courage. 

From his sidelined position on the left wing, Daniel considered the options. Clara was obviously fuming, but she didn't understand, if this went wrong it would be he who would get the kicking. Maybe worse, these boys could have knives or guns ... Who knew where this could go if he showed a lack of respect. No, he reasoned, best to ride it out. Have a few drinks, act all friendly, leave with all his teeth intact. Who cared about dignity? 

He then made the fatal error of leaving his wife alone with the men. 'Where's the toilet?' he asked. 

Clara, mouth hanging in surprise, with Bob Marley wailing about no woman no cry in the background, predators all around, watched her husband leave the bar. What was he thinking leaving her alone with ... them? 

'Are you afraid of us?' Green Vest asked. 

Clara considered the question. The blaze of anger had cooled to a leaden ball of fear in the pit of her stomach. 'A little,' she admitted, nodding, her eyes lifting to regard the man face-to-face. 

'We's just messin' with you,' Green Vest relented. 'Just a little joke.' 

Ire flared again. 'It isn't funny,' Clara returned. 

'We do it from time to time. Get Linus to trawl the hotels an' pick out some likely prospects. We gets a bottle of rum or two outta tourists, mebbe they leave some cash, fifty dollars or whatever for a cab ride back to the lights.' The man grinned at Clara. 'Linus picked you guys 'cos he thought you wuz hot stuff.' 

Through gritted teeth -- the gall of the man -- Clara said: 'I'm so fucking flattered.' 

'That husband of yours ...' Green Vest's dreadlocks swayed with the jerk of his head '... he don't seem to be paying you much respect.' Clara noticed the man's eyes fill with scorn. 'He knows you wanna leave, but he's too scared to act.' He nodded again, sucking air through his teeth, a signal of contempt. 

'You don't show much respect either,' Clara retorted, eyes flashing. She swigged her beer, staring a challenge into Green Vest's face over the bottle. 

'But I'd look after you like a man should.' 

To her immense surprise Clara experienced a pulse of interest at that ambiguous statement. Her clitoris throbbed lightly, just enough to make the blonde aware of her sexual arousal. She looked from Green Vest's face to the faces of his friends, both of whom had sat there, silent, perhaps sensing a glimmer of where this to-and-fro could lead. Could those men feel the tension brewing between the arrogant, muscular black man and herself? She looked across to the barman behind his counter. That man too had paused, standing silent and immobile. Clara caught his look, the barman wanted her too, they all wanted her. 

'Oh, God,' Clara muttered, confused by her body's reaction to the scene. 

I don't fancy any of them ... This is so sleazy, disgusting ... The thought of the four of them perving at me ... Four of them ... Four ... Her attention returned to the man in the green vest. I just bet you'd look after me. You'd protect me in this kind of situation. Physically shield me from this kind of shit. He'd look after me in other ways too. 

Clara's pulse quickened at the thought of this man making love to her. Her nipples tightened, her sex, of its own accord, began to oil. She felt the heat between her legs suffuse upwards to brush her cleavage and throat with a rosy glow. Thank God for the crap lighting, Clara thought as the blush coloured her cheeks. 

'I think you would,' the girl mumbled. 'I'm sure you'd look after me.' 

Green Vest made his move immediately. 'Honeymoon, huh?' He shifted closer. 'You should be in bed.' His gaze swept Clara's body. She felt naked, exposed and vulnerable beneath his look. Her body responded to his burning proximity, the scent of him -- earthy, virile, sexy. Clara shifted her rump against the plastic chair as her insides clenched and her nipples began to ache. She revised her earlier estimate of not finding any of the men attractive. 

Anger flared again. What was she thinking of? Damn her traitorous body. She blamed her husband for this, blamed his timidity and lack of balls. She blamed the local men, was appalled by their arrogance and surety. She hated Green Vest for his assurance, resented his proximity and the effect his virility had upon her. He was so cocky and arrogant ... but at the same time Clara found him sexy. Why couldn't her husband move like that? Why couldn't Daniel act with such cocksure conceit. 

'In bed?' Clara mocked. 'Why should I be in bed? You think a honeymoon is about sex?' 

'It's all about sex ...' 

His hand fell on her bare thigh, eased higher along her leg beneath her dress. 

Clara started, flinching and gasping at the audacity. 

And then her husband returned. 

For reasons she would never quite understand, Clara left the black man's hand on her leg, his fingers branding her skin. 

Daniel blinked, sensing some shift in the atmosphere; he just wasn't sure what it was. From the waist down his wife's body was masked by the table, Daniel couldn't see the arm snaking under Clara's dress. 

'Uhm ...' Daniel began, remaining standing while five pairs of eyes regarded him. There was something in his wife's expression he couldn't read, while the three seated men looked up at him with varying degrees of disdain. He looked across to the barman. Oddly, Daniel thought he recognised pity in the older man's look. 'I think it's time we left, Clara,' he offered, with as much dignity and force his quavering voice could muster. 

Everyone's attention turned to the woman. Long seconds were marked by the omnipresent reggae beat. 

*** Linus bounced a wheel against the high kerb. 'There ya go,' he said. 'There's the strip. Your hotel is that way.' He pointed a finger. 

Daniel looked at him. 'What about my wife?' he asked. 

Linus shrugged. 'She said she wanted to stay. I'll make sure she gets back OK ... I just dunno what time.' His finger pointed again. 'Hotel's that way.' He wanted the man gone, out of his car so he could get back to the bar. He'd returned from his errand just in time. Daniel wanted to leave but his wife ...? 

There was something going on there, and Linus was eager to see what was what. The blonde woman choosing to stay in that place? She virtually told her husband to fuck off. And judging by the grins on the boys' faces ... 

'I'll get her back in one piece,' he assured an anxious Daniel. 

A few minutes later the car slumped to a stop outside the bar, the driver's door protesting after Linus coaxed the squeaking clanking hulk back to the shack. He abandoned the heap, hurrying towards the wooden door. 

'Hey!' he called, finding the door barred. 'It's me. Let me in.' A few moments later a thunk came from inside. 

'Get in,' the barman muttered. 'Quick.' He chocked the plank into its slot, effectively locking the door once Linus had pushed past. 

'Another one!' Clara called. 'Another gorgeous man. Pull up a chair, Linus. Come and join the party.' 

Clara's eyes shone with excitement. Her dress was now bunched around her waist, Green Vest's hand was wedged between her legs, his fingers pressed against her vulva. She faced Linus, the buttons of the dress undone, her pale, long-nippled breasts exposed. Her hands ski poled two cocks, while Short Hair, standing at her shoulder, slowly stroked his own erection. 

'Give that thing to me,' Clara said, her chin jutting towards Short Hair as she angled backwards. 'Put it back in my mouth.' 

Clara squirmed her backside, opening her legs as wide as the chair allowed to offer her burning sex to Green Vests long fingers. The man teased the blonde's greasy labia, splaying the lips and dabbing a forefinger at her opening. With her mouth full of dark gristle, Clara moaned. 

'Never seen anything like it before,' the barman muttered to Linus. ' She made her husband pay for the rum and the beers and told him to leave her fifty bucks for more drinks. Now look at it. Married two days ago she said ...' 

Both men watched while Clara's pink tongue traced a long line from the short- haired man's swinging balls, along the underside of his long penis to the bulging dome crowning his erection. The blonde popped the cock-head into her mouth, her cheeks dipping into concavity as she sucked. The man groaned when Clara, releasing one erection from her grip, took hold of Short Hair's cock at the root and wanked it into her mouth. 

'Shit,' the man sighed,' his fingers twisting through Clara's hair. 'Suck my fuckin' cock ...' 

'I'll suck all of them,' Clara gasped, the mushroom-shaped cock-head dropping from her lips. 'All of them.' She eyed the barman and grinned. 'You too, old man. I'll suck yours too. You're in this as much as them. You want to fuck me too?' Lust boiled inside her. Clara was desperate to be fucked now. She'd committed herself to the act and there would be no holding back. Five black men. Five black cocks. 

She questioned her marriage -- Daniel had shown his true colours that evening, she'd suspected he was weak all along. Pressurised into marrying him by her parents' and society's expectations, she'd had her doubts, but being a dutiful daughter she'd complied. Now the wheels had come off the matrimonial carriage. What triggered this insanity, Clara briefly pondered, a need to punish her husband? Or was she punishing her parents too? As far back as she could remember she'd moulded herself to their wishes -- the schools, the clubs, the most suitable man ... 

Fuck them all. Fuck Daniel and, in an entirely different context, fuck these five men too. 

'I'm free to do whatever I want,' Clara muttered. 'I'll deal with the shit in the morning.' She reached for Short-Hair's erection again. A moment before her lips wrapped around the girth of the man's chocolate-coloured shaft, Clara grinned into Green Vest's face. 'Are you going to stick that fucking thing into me? Are you just going to tickle my pussy all night, or are you going to fuck me?' 

The man chuckled. 'Well, well, you've changed little miss whitey. How scared you wuz not long ago ... now you askin' for black. Well, I'm happy to oblige.' 

He rose quickly, the back of his knees tipping his chair backwards. He struggled with his jeans, which were rumpled around his hips, in his haste to be at the girl. She was hot. Sweet and white and begging for black cock. He'd met women like this before, usually middle-aged bitches who wanted to walk on the dark side, but this one wanted a gang-bang, which was definitely not the usual. What was the deal with her husband? Two days married and yet here she was. Still, whatever the cut, he was going into it. How could anyone turn down that sweet-faced, big-eyed offer?  

===

He moved between the girl's legs, hauling her bodily, hands around her hips, into position. 'Hold the chair steady, mon,' he growled at his long-haired friend. 'Hold it steady or she gunna fall.' He shunted the blonde's legs over his arms, the crook of her knees draped over his forearms. Crouching, he held the tip of his cock at her opening. 'I'm gunna split you in two,' he said, then thrust. 

'Ooh,' the woman gurgled. 'That's good. Nice and thick and long.' She looked up, raising her chin from her chest, awkwardly wall-eyed in that position, to goad the man further. 'Now use it, you bastard,' she sneered. 'Use that thing and fuck me.' 

Clara heard an indeterminate mutter from Linus, and then blanked out all that was happening around her, concentrating instead upon the sensation of being filled with cock. The thing inside her probed deeply, deeper than any man had ever gone before, not that she'd had many men, she wasn't a slut -- Clara would have giggled at that contradiction if she'd been able. This one stretched her too, as well as probing deep. Not uncomfortably, there was no pain, just a glorious sensation of being filled to the brim. She looked down, along the front of her body, past her pale, trembling breasts, over her stomach to the place between her legs, to her labia that clung tackily to the gristle embedded inside her. She gasped when she saw the length of him withdraw slowly, the shaft of that cock glistening with goo -- her own lust coating it. 

'Oh, fuck,' she moaned. 'Oh. My. God ...' Her head lolled backwards, blonde hair sweeping the hands of the man holding the chair. 

Short Hair moved then. He crouched and ducked his head, taking one of Clara's long nipples into his mouth. He sucked at it, elongating the pink nub with suction from his lips. The woman groaned, her hands at his temples, guiding him from one breast to the other. 

The man inside Clara growled as he increased the tempo of his thrusts. His hair swung from side to side in a wild curtain of swinging dreads. The chair legs, moulded plastic and not given to such a strenuous load buckled, dangerously close to collapse. 

'White girl and black cock,' the man grunted. 'Gunna give this bitch some of the hot stuff. Gunna give her the juice ...' 

Linus, unable to resist, stroked his exposed length. He was long and thick and ready to take a turn. 'You gonna do her too, Pop?' he asked the barman. 

'I don' think I will,' the man replied, his patois drawl thick and slow. 'He's gonna dump a load inside her.' The man's chin jutted towards the scene. 'I don' think I wanna stir that stuff with ma spoon. Mebbe's I'll just dump mine on her ninnies.' 

Linus, with no compunction about sloppy seconds, or even thirds, left the barman to his conjecture about the quality of the blonde's tits. He thought about the woman's anus. Mebbe she'll take in her ass? He then decided that that might be, quite literally, pushing it too far. Moving closer to the group arranged haphazardly around the girl, he reached out a hand to touch her pale skin. 

'Do it to her, mon,' he hissed, accent thickening with his excitement as he stared where the girl's body accommodated his friend. 'Fuck her good.' 

The man between Clara's legs grunted. His face contorted into a twist of agony. He thrust once, deep into Clara, the depth eliciting a yelp from the woman. 'That's good,' Clara called. 'Do it again ...' The man grunted a second time, grimacing, his head twisting side to side. On the second thrust he paused, his balls dangling against the perpendicular crease between Clara's buttocks. He groaned, cock pulsing at its root, squirting into Clara's body. 

'Uh,' he grunted in time with each subsequent pump. 'Uh ... Uh ... Uh ... Fuck ... Uh ...' His eyes opened and great breath sighed from his chest. 'Hoo,' he called. 'That felt so good.' The muscles in his triceps tensed as he hefted himself upright, his cock sliding out of the girl on a rush of ejaculate. 'I came in her pretty good,' he grinned, viscous gloop dribbling from Clara's gaping opening. 

The woman lifted herself from the chair. She impatiently shrugged the dress over her head, carelessly discarding it on the stained, bottle-ringed table. 'Another one,' she called to no one in particular. 'Another cock. Give me more. Who's next?' She walked to the bar and rested her forearms against the counter. 'From behind,' she insisted, her hips swinging in invitation. 'Who wants me like this?' 

After a momentary hiatus there was a scramble to see who could reach the girl first. Amused, his part done for the time being, Green Vest smirked, collapsing into a chair to watch the show. His hand reached for the rum bottle. 

'Come on, Linus,' Clara moaned to the man who'd reached her first. 'You conned me into being here, make it up to me now.' 

Linus dug his long, dark fingers into Clara's hips. He entered her, her body oozing semen. A squelching fart rasped from their conjunction and the girl giggled. 'Mix it up, Linus,' she moaned. 'Stir that porridge.' 

A few short stabs later and Linus buckled at the knees. He dug deeper into the woman, just as his friend had done, and squirted his offering into her. 

'This is no good,' Clara taunted, hands on hips, thighs glistening with the goo sliding out of her. She faced her audience. 'Two of you studs so far and I haven't come once.' Her lips formed a moue of disappointment, she shook her head. 'Not a good showing, eh, boys?' 

'I'll make you come, you hoity-toity bitch.' Everyone, including Clara, stared at the speaker as the barman sauntered to her. Clara gasped when his fingers pushed inside. First he used two stiff digits on her, finger-fucking her where she stood. Then, after bending the blonde's fist around his exposed penis he curled his fingers inside her. 

'Oh, shit, that's nice,' Clara sighed, her eyes closing as she shuffled her feet wider. 'Rub me right there. Oh yes ... That's it. You're right on the spot inside me.' 

The woman climaxed, her sobs buffeting the ramshackle walls, louder than the pervasive thump-thump from the speakers. 

'Suck my dick,' the barman growled, pushing the still convulsing blonde to her knees. 'Suck it,' he repeated, holding Clara's head in one hand, fist twisting her hair while he forced himself between her lips. 

Clara took hold of the long cock that threatened to choke her. She slobbered and drooled over it, sucking wildly. Semen dribbled out of her and pooled on the dusty wooden floorboards between her knees as she knelt amid the detritus, her head busy against the barman's groin. 

'Here it comes,' the man warned, grimacing. 

Clara crooned obscenities, euphoric at what she'd become in that dingy Caribbean bar. She smeared the man's ejaculate into her breasts when the heavy outpouring ceased. She cuffed a smear of goo across her cheek, wondering how she was going to get through the hotel lobby in such a bedraggled state. And what would her husband do when he saw her, hair matted with dried semen, her body crusted with the stuff? Would he hate her or would his eyes gleam with jealous ardour? Would he lay her down on the plush bed and stir the gloop inside her with his pale cock? 

'Fuck you, Daniel,' Clara muttered. 'I've still got two men to service. 'Come on, boys,' she said to the two remaining men. 'Come and get my hungry pussy. My cunt's thirsty for more spunk ...' 

The men advanced slowly, grinning, their cock's swinging. 

The one with short hair stood in front of Clara. He crouched slightly, easing his penis between the woman's legs while his long-haired friend pressed his body against the blonde's back. Clara gasped when, in a simultaneous assault, Short-Hair penetrated her dribbling cunt while the other man's hands circumvented her torso and grabbed at her breasts. The man behind her licked and kissed and nibbled at her neck. Clara moaned at the gentle caress of his lips, such a contrast to the rough thrusting of his friend between her legs. 

'On my hands and knees,' Clara blurted. 'I want you in my mouth,' she said to the long-haired man. 'I want to taste your spunk ...' 

The trio quickly arranged themselves, Short-Hair groaning, his eyes rolling when he fucked deep and hard into the white woman. The other man knelt in front of Clara's face, offering his dark meat to her. 

Both men erupted simultaneously, one squirting yet another viscous load into her sodden, seeping pussy, while the other, with Clara gagging, her eyes streaming, pumped an overflowing volume of gloop into her throat. 

'Oh my God ...' Clara spluttered, coughing and gasping for air. Drool and semen slid down her chin, spattering across the upper slopes of her tits, garlanding her chest. 'Whatever will my husband say?' 

Green-Vest chuckled, already coaxing a second hard-on to life. He approached the woman sprawled on the filthy floor. 'Time for another round,' he smiled.' Report_Story
