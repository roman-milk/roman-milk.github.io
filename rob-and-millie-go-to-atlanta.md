Rob and Millie Go to Atlanta

I watched her skirt tighten over her tight round ass as she bent to put some papers in the lower drawer of the file cabinet. Everything about Candace made me hard and it tore me up that I would never be able to do what I wanted which was to spend hours, days, weeks and months making love to her. She knew I wanted her and I was pretty sure that she'd had a few licentious thoughts about me, but I was cursed. A wicked spell had been cast over me and that spell prevented me from having Candace. The spell had a name - marriage. 

 As I looked at Candy's tight ass I wondered why I was so different from most of the other men that I knew; men I worked with, socialized with and played various sports with. I watched them run around on their wives and girlfriends like it was the most natural thing in the world to do. Was it natural? Were they normal and I was the oddball? 

 I had been married to Mildred for twenty-four years and not once had I been unfaithful to her. I'd had chances galore - some that I would dearly loved to have taken - but I had given my word when we stood in front of the assembled guests. I had promised that Millie would be my one and only and I had been raised in a family where you were taught that your word was your bond. For better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part, or quite simply, "Once in never out." 

 Unfortunately, as I had come to find out, Millie wasn't raised with the same set of values; or if she had been she had cast them aside. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 I met Mildred Pierce Byrns on my first day at college. My first class was English Composition 101 and I was sitting in a seat in room 114 in Seaforth Hall when I felt a hand tap me on my shoulder and I turned to see a very good looking brunette standing there. Dark hair and green eyes always got to me and she had them both along with a very trim and athletic looking body. 

 "Excuse me" she said, "but you are sitting in my seat." 

 Good looking girl or not, the tone of her voice pissed me off. I looked around the half empty, but filling classroom and said: 

 "I don't think so. It is the first day of class and the instructor isn't even here yet to make a seating chart." 

 "You don't understand" she said in a patronizing tone of voice as she pointed at a guy sitting to my left, "He is my boyfriend and the girl to your right is my best friend Annie and the girl in front of you is Gloria and we always sit together so you have to move." 

 By that time I was slightly pissed at her "I'm me and you have to do what I want" attitude so I said: 

 "This ain't high school honey; this is the real world and in the real world you don't always get what you want." I pointed at a section of the classroom that was still empty and said, "If you all have to sit together I'd suggest you get over there before it fills up." 

 "Hey dude, just get up and give her the seat" the guy said. I took a good look at him. A beefy looking guy with one of those buzz cuts favored by football players. He'd once had the initial of his high school shaved in his hair and it was filling in as he let his hair grow out. Fairly bulky, like he was the product of the weight room, and I pegged him as a guy attending on a football scholarship. I met his eyes and said: 

 "Sorry, but I'm not moving...DUDE!" 

 He tensed and I could see he planned on showing me the error of my ways. He was bigger than me, but I had lettered in wrestling and physical contact was something that I was used to so I got myself ready for what would have to be done if he pushed it. The brunette with the green eyes saw it coming and she said: 

 "No Brad, let it go." 

 He gave me a look that said, "This isn't over by a long shot" and I smiled at him. He got up and he and the three girls moved to where they could sit together and a minute or so later the instructor arrived and the class got underway. 

 I noticed that the brunette kept glancing over at me and at any other time I might have taken it as a sign that my attentions wouldn't necessarily be refused, but under the circumstances I put that thought out of my mind. The instructor did make a seating chart so the four of them were locked in place for the balance of the term and I didn't expect that I would have any more to do with them. The class met Monday and Thursday and I didn't have any of the four in any of my other classes so I basically only saw them two hours a week and I ignored them and they ignored me. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was the Thursday of the fifth week of the term and I had come out of an off campus pizzeria with a large pepperoni and was getting in my car when I heard: 

 "Hey you! Wise ass!" 

 I turned and saw Brad standing there with the brunette, who I'd learned was Millie and her girlfriend Annie. 

 "You and me got unfinished business." 

 I put my pizza on the back seat and then turned to the three of them. I looked him over and said: 

 "You got three inches and probably sixty pounds on me, but you are obviously a bonehead so I guess we are pretty evenly matched. Bring it!" 

 "What?" 

 "You want a piece of me asshole, so come and get it." 

 His face got red - I'd challenged him in front of his two females - and he rushed at me. When big guys go after littler guys they never expect a problem so when I executed a letter perfect take-down on him he was totally surprised. His head smacked down on the sidewalk and he was temporarily dazed. Being a firm believer in the old adage, "Once you get them down, keep them down" I kicked him hard in the stones, twice in the ribs and then once more in the stones. As he lay there in the fetal position, moaning and with both hands cupping his hurting genitals, I looked at the two girls and said: 

 "You both are obviously intelligent because stupid people rarely make it into college and you are both gorgeous so attracting males can't be a problem. So the question has to be why are the two of you hanging with a meat-head like him?" 

 I got on my car and drove off leaving the two girls standing there looking down at the guy on the ground. The following Monday Brad wasn't in class and I never saw him again. I heard later he was cut from the football team and he dropped out of school. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That Friday I was sitting at a table in the cafeteria when Millie, Annie and Gloria walked up and asked if they could join me. A quick glance around showed that there were plenty of empty tables available so I guessed they had a reason for wanting to sit with me and I motioned for them to sit down. They were nervously looking back and forth at each other so I took the bull by the horns and asked: 

 "And what can I do for you ladies?" 

 There were more nervous glances and then Millie said, "We wanted, no - not we, I - I wanted to apologize for my behavior on the first day of class. I was having a bad day, but that doesn't excuse my being such a bitch. But I was a bitch and you responded to it. That brought out the worst in Brad. Annie and I had no idea that Brad was going to do what he did the other day. If I had known I would have tried to stop it." 

 She looked at me expectantly and I knew what was expected of me so I said, "Apology accepted." 

 She and Annie glanced at each other and then she said, "There is one other thing. What you said about us being with such a meat-head. Brad wasn't always that way. He changed when he made all-state as a defensive tackle. The four of us" and she waved toward Annie and Gloria and I guessed that the fourth was Brad, "grew up together in the same neighborhood and Brad was always like a brother to us. I just wanted you to know that is why we were with him." 

 Gloria looked at her watch and then said, "Hey guys, we need to go or we will be late for class." The three of them got up and I sat there and watched them go and wondered what was the real reason behind their little visit. 

 I got some inkling of it when all of a sudden I started running into Annie wherever I went. I began thinking that the apology was just to clear the air and distance Annie from the 'meathead' so I would see her in a different light. Don't ask me why I had that thought because I don't honestly know. God knows it wasn't because I was a sought after guy and was used to being pursued. Far from it. I'd only had one fairly long term relationship in my young life and that one had ended badly when Sarah dropped me for the starting full-back on our high school football team. I did have the satisfaction of seeing him drop her for one of the cheerleaders, but that was small comfort. 

 I pretty much stayed away from girls after that. I planned on waiting until I got to college before getting in the dating game again. I suppose I was thinking that the girls would be a little older and more mature. They probably were, but I'd not found one yet that I cared enough about to ask out. But even though I was just a normal guy, not special in any way, there was no denying that Annie seemed to show up everywhere I went. It could have been a coincidence, but I didn't think so. When I did run into Annie some place she always said hi and then made conversation with me. She did give me several openings to ask her out, but I never did. The fact of the matter is that I had no interest in Annie. None. 

 It was the week before the Christmas break and I was again sitting at a table in the cafeteria when Millie walked up to the table, said hi and then sat down. Although I had seen her around I'd not spoken to her since the day of her apology so I was not really prepared for what she hit me with. 

 "Can I ask you a question?" I nodded a yes and she asked, "Are you gay?" 

 "Good Lord no! What the hell brought that on?" 

 "Well, no one has ever seen you with a girl and poor Annie has done everything she can think of to get your attention, but you ignore her so we wondered if you were gay. I decided to ask you straight out so that if you were I could tell Annie to stop wasting her time." 

 "Sorry to give you the bad news, but the reason Annie isn't getting anywhere with me is because I'm not interested in her." 

 "Why not? She's a great looking girl; she's smart, witty, has a great sense of humor and has a ton of personality." 

 I don't know why I said it; to this day I don't know, but I was looking Millie right in the eye when I said the seven words that changed my life. 

 "But she doesn't have flashing green eyes." 

 I saw Millie's green eyes get big as the import of what I'd just said hit her. "Oh my" she said, "Oh my God. Oh shit; how am I going to tell her? She's my best friend. Oh Jesus. What am I going to do? Why haven't you said something before now?" 

 How could I tell her that I didn't even know until she sat down across from me and I looked into her eyes. 

 Her friendship with Annie survived and Annie was her Maid of Honor at our wedding. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Fast forward twenty-four very good years and three children. Our son James had graduated from West Point and was currently serving in Iraq. Daughter Marlene was married and had just presented us with our first grandson and daughter Marion was six weeks from graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in Electrical Engineering. The children were gone and Millie was now an empty nester with a lot of time on her hands. 

 God alone knows why, but she started to feel down about herself. She was still able to light my fire and I told her so, but the fact of the matter was that she felt the only reason I was saying it was because I was her husband and I was expected to say things like that. As far as she was concerned when we went to parties the men didn't hover around her the way they used to; they didn't flirt with her any more, didn't ask her to dance as much as they used to. There were a lot of reasons for that, but not one of them was the one she thought it was. She felt that she was unattractive, that she had lost her looks and her desirability. 

 I would have bet my life that Millie had never been unfaithful to me, but she was used to receiving the attention that beautiful women take for granted and when she perceived that she wasn't getting that attention any more it bothered her. It bothered her big time. She lost confidence in herself and that caused some changes in her. The biggest being that she seemed to lose all interest in sex. This of course had a major impact on me. Even at the age of forty-seven I enjoyed making love to Millie three and four times a week, but it slipped to twice a week and then once a week. 

 I knew what the problem was and I tried to talk to her; to convince her that she was still sexy and desirable, but she wouldn't listen. I was her husband and I had to say things like that. I bought her sexy clothes and took her places she could be seen and admired and she did attract attention, but when I pointed it out she pooh-poohed it saying the people were our friends and were just being nice. Nothing I said or did seemed to get through to her. 

 When our sex life dropped to once every two weeks or so I decided that I was going to have to do something. I had a five day business trip coming up and I decided that I was going to take Millie along. We could spend the evenings going out to dinner and then drinking and dancing. There would be no friends or acquaintances there so she would not be able to discount the attention she got as just friends being nice. I had a plan; a plan that would re-kindle the fire in our love making, a plan that would give Millie her confidence back. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 We got to Atlanta Sunday night and checked into our hotel. When we got to the room I stood off to the side with a big smile on my face as I watched Millie open her suitcase to unpack it. The look on her face was priceless as she took in what was there. I had switched suitcases on her and the 'sensible' clothes she had packed had been replaced with every sexy piece of her clothing that I could fit into the bag. She turned to look at me and I smiled at her and told her that I planned on having a good time every night we were there. 

 Monday morning I kissed her goodbye and headed for my first meeting of the day. I told Millie to expect me back by five-thirty and to be ready to go out for dinner. When I got back to the room at five twenty-five Millie wasn't there, but five minutes after I got there she came rushing in. She was wearing flip- flops and a robe and she said: 

 "Sorry darling, time got away from me. Let me take a quick shower and then I'll get dressed for dinner. As she headed for the shower she dropped the robe and I saw that she had on a bikini that I had never seen before. The suit I had packed had been a one piece tank suit. Oh well, I thought, progress of sorts since she certainly looked sexy in it. I commented on the suit over dinner and Millie told me that she had bought it that afternoon. 

 "I felt so ridiculous being the only one at the pool in a one piece so I bought a two piece so I would fit in." 

 "Well sweetie, you sure looked great in it." 

 Dinner was followed by dancing and some drinks and when we got back to the room Millie, for the first time in six months, initiated the love making and she wasn't satisfied with only twice. She worked very hard to get four times out of me. 

 Tuesday I again told her I would be back by five-thirty. It was five-thirty on the dot when I walked into the room and once again Millie wasn't there. Ten minutes went by and I was starting to get just a little bit upset when I heard the key in the door and Millie rushed in and breathlessly said: 

 "Sorry baby, but it won't take me long to take a quick shower and get dressed." 

 I was a little pissed at her for not being there and ready to go at the time I told her that I would be back. Not only that, but she could have at least left me a note so I would know where she was. As I listened to the shower running I shook off my bad mood. What the hell, I'd brought her along to give her a chance to relax and enjoy herself so why was I getting upset because she was doing just that. 

 We had dinner and then moved to the hotel lounge to have a few drinks and to dance to the live music. The band was big into the music of the sixties and seventies and played a lot of slow tunes. After about an hour or so I got up to use the bathroom and when I finished my business and started back to our table I saw two guys standing there talking to Millie. For a brief second I felt myself starting to get territorial, but then I realized that what I was watching was what I had hoped for when I brought Millie along. The two guys were not "friends just being nice" but two horn-dogs trying to pick up a beautiful woman. Millie had to know that and that meant she had to realize she was still a sexy and desirable woman. I decided to give things a few moments before I went back and my presence put a damper on things. 

 I took a seat at the end of the bar, ordered a drink, and then sat and watched. After a couple of minutes the two guys sat down with Millie and waved a waitress over. Another couple of minutes went by as the two men talked to Millie and then the waitress returned with the drink order. I noticed that there were four drinks placed on the table instead of three and that told me that Millie had let them know she was not alone. That was my signal to get back. 

 As I came up to the table the two men stood up and Millie said, "Rob honey, these two gentlemen are Pete and Tony" and the two men offered me their hands and I shook with them as Millie said, "I asked them to sit down with me while we waited for you to get back." 

 "What it is" said the one named Pete, "Is that we saw her sitting here alone and we came over to ask her to dance." 

 "I told them I'd have to ask you if you minded so I had them sit with me while we waited. They bought us a drink" and then she waited to see what I was going to say. 

 I figured that she was flattered by the attention and wanted to dance with them or she wouldn't have invited them to sit. Well, it was what I wanted - for her to get her confidence back - so I said: 

 "Of course I don't mind. We came in here to enjoy ourselves and have a good time so if you want to dance, you should dance." 

 Pete stood up and offered her his hand and said, "May I?" and Millie got up and took his hand and they moved out onto the dance floor. Tony and I talked as Pete and Millie stayed out on the floor for three numbers and then the band took a break. The four of us talked until the band started again and Tony stood and asked, "My turn?" and then he and Millie headed out onto the floor. I deliberately sat with my back to the dance floor so I wouldn't make Millie self-conscious. 

 For the next hour the two men kept Millie on the floor and then I exercised my rights. The band had just started to play a nice slow tune and Pete was just starting to ask for the next dance, but I said: 

 "Sorry guys, but it is my turn now." 

 As we danced I asked Millie if she was having a good time and she moved in close and said: 

 "Yes I am baby and thank you; I needed this." 

 I pulled her closer and kissed her and the song ended and we went back to the table. I thanked the two for an enjoyable evening and then told them I had an early morning meeting and we needed to be heading up to our room. 

 "You could leave Millie with us" Pete said, "We would see to it that she gets back to your room safely when the band quits." 

 I'll just bet you would I thought as I said, "Thanks for the offer, but I don't think so. Goodnight." 

 It might have just been my imagination, but I thought I saw disappointment in Millie's eyes as I led her toward the elevators. We were no sooner in the room than Millie started dropping clothes on the floor. 

 "Hurry Rob, hurry" as she headed for the bed. "Yes indeed Rob" I thought, "Bringing Millie on this trip was a stroke of genius. Millie flat wore me out and when I fell asleep I slept like a baby.

++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next morning I woke up to Millie fondling my dick and as soon as she saw that I was awake she slid down and took my cock in her mouth and sucked on it until it was hard and then she moved over me and lowered herself down on my cock. She bounced up and down on me until I got close to cumming and then I rolled her off of me and onto her back and fucked her as hard as I could until I came. 

 As I dressed I told Millie that the days meeting would probably run late so it could be after six by the time I got back to the room. She told me she would probably go shopping and spend some time around the pool and then I kissed her and headed for my first meeting of the day. At eleven-thirty I received a message from the man I was supposed to meet with that afternoon. His computer system had crashed and things at his plant were in chaos and he had to cancel. So, when the morning meeting ended I headed for the hotel. I would be able to take Millie to lunch and then maybe we could do some sight seeing. 

 Millie wasn't in the room when I got there so I decided to see if she was by the pool. She was, but she wasn't alone. As I came down the hallway that led to the pool patio area I saw Millie lying on her stomach on a chaise lounge and Pete and Tony were with her. Tony was rubbing lotion on her back and Pete was rubbing on lotion further down. From where I was I saw that his hands were on her ass, her legs were spread wide apart and I knew that the fingers rubbing the lotion into her skin were also brushing against her pussy. And she wasn't doing anything to stop it! 

 I backed away from the door that led out onto the pool area and then headed for the hotel bar. The bar had windows that looked out onto the pool area and I took a seat at the bar where I could see Millie, Tony and Pete. I nursed my beer and watched the three of them for maybe five minutes when a voice said: 

 "She sure is something isn't she?" 

 I turned and saw Phil, the bartender, standing there. "I hadn't noticed" I said. 

 He laughed. "Right! You haven't taken your eyes off of her since you walked in here and sat down on that stool." 

 "I didn't know I was being that obvious." 

 "Hey, you ain't the only man who has been in here this week who wished it could be him out there with her." 

 "This week?" 

 "Yeah. She showed up Monday. At first I thought she was a hooker trying to attract business, but Tony says she is just a housewife having a fling." 

 "Tony?" 

 "The dark haired guy out here with her. He says she is here with her husband who spends all his days in meetings so him and Pete, that's the other guy out there, offered to keep her from being lonely during the day." 

 "And keeping her from being lonely means?" 

 "All I know is that the three of them leave here and go up to one of the hospitality suites and spend most of the afternoon there. What goes on inside I can't say." 

 "They ever leave her alone?" 

 "They haven't since they moved in on her Monday. Why you asking? Want to try your luck?" 

 "Wouldn't you?" 

 "Good point." 

 He moved away to take care of another customer and I sat there and thought about what he'd just said. Tony and Pete had moved in on Millie Monday, but Tuesday night when they joined us at our table they acted like they had never met. He said they went up to a suite and spent most of the afternoon there and Monday and Tuesday Millie had rushed into the room late and had hurriedly taken a shower. Was it to was the chlorine from the pool off or had it been to wash off something else entirely. 

 Out on the patio I saw Pete lean down and kiss Millie and I watched as she returned it. It was almost one when Tony offered her his hand and she took it and he helped her up from the lounger. Tony said something and she laughed and stood on her toes and kissed him and then the three of them headed for the door that would take them to the elevators. 

 I waved the bartender over, took out five twenties and handed them to him. "What can you tell me about Tony and Pete?" 

 He looked at the money and asked, "Why?" 

 "Because I know the woman. I do business with her husband back in Kansas City. I've always wanted a taste, but she has always acted like the faithful and loving wife. I may just be able to use what I've just seen to my advantage, but before I can do that I will need to have all my ducks lined up in a row." 

 "Well, Tony is an assistant manager here. Pete is his best buddy and he owns a real estate company. It must do pretty well because he always seems to have the time to play with Tony whenever Tony scores." 

 "You sure that Tony scores? Could he be one of those guys who brags to make people think he is more of a stud than he really is? Could maybe he and Pete be in the suite playing Monopoly or some other board game with Mildred?" 

 "Oh no; if Tony says he is nailing her you can take it to the bank. He has more pussy on the line than you can shake a stick at. Wanda, the waitress with the big tits on the restaurant side? She usually gets it on with him on the days that she works and she is pissed at him right now because he is spending all his time on this new one. Now I ask you - you going to waste time on something you ain't nailing when Wanda is ready for you?" 

 "I guess you have a point there. So I can take it as a given that if Tony and Pete have her in a room with a bed they are both doing her?" 

 "I'd bet on it." 

 "Taking turns, or both at the same time?" 

 "I don't know." 

 "Does Tony ever brag about what he does?" 

 "No, but he will tell you about it if you ask." 

 There is another hundred in it for you if you can find out for me everything you can about what Tony and Pete are doing to Mildred and how she is taking it. I especially want to know if she has any birthmarks, scars or tattoos that are normally hidden when she is dressed. Something I can say to her to prove to her that I know about Tony and Pete. I want to be ready for her the next time I run into her back home. Can you do it?" 

 "For another hundred? Damned straight I can." 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 I left the bar and headed for our room and I wondered if I would find Millie there. She wasn't so I opened my briefcase and reviewed the presentation I would be giving the next day, but I couldn't seem to concentrate on it. I was not stupid and I was not going to go into denial. There was no doubt in my mind about what Millie was doing with Tony and Pete. What I had a hard time believing was how fast it had happened. I would bet my life that Millie had never once been unfaithful to me before the trip so how had a faithful wife turned cheat in less than half a day? Faithful and loving wife when I left for my first meeting on Monday and a cheating slut by two in the afternoon. And with not one, but two men. 

 Like I said, I'm not big on denial, but I do like to be certain of things and that's why I primed Phil when I mentioned scars, birthmarks or tattoos. Millie has a strawberry shaped birthmark on her right butt cheek, a small half-moon shaped scar just below her right breast and on our fifteenth anniversary she had surprised me with a tattoo. She has always shaved her beaver and two inches to the left of her opening she had a heart-shaped tattoo with "Forever yours" inside it. If Phil mentioned any one of those three I'd have all the proof I needed to know that Millie had indeed been naked with Tony and Pete and if she was naked in a hotel room with them they sure would not have been playing gin rummy. 

 I'd told Millie I wouldn't be back until after six so I was not surprised when she didn't get back to the room until five to six. She was surprised to see me and I saw a touch of worry cross her face. 

 "I didn't expect you until after six. How long have you been here?" 

 "Maybe ten minutes." 

 "I'll hurry and get ready" she said as she turned to head for the shower. As she turned her robe gapped open just a touch; just enough for me to see that she was naked under the robe. 

 "Millie?" She looked over her shoulder at me and I said, "You are spending a lot of time at the pool." I hesitated a beat and again saw a touch of worry on her face and then I said, "Maybe we should put one in at the house." 

 I saw the worry replaced by relief and she said, "No, I don't think so. At home I have too much to do to lie around a pool. Here I don't have anything better to do while I wait for you. 

 When we got off the elevator Millie started to turn into the hotel restaurant, but I told her we weren't staying at the hotel that night. I thought I saw a trace of disappointment in her eyes and as we passed the lounge I glanced in and saw Tony and Pete sitting at a table. I wondered if Millie was getting a charge out of spending time with her lovers in front of me. And they were her lovers - I had no doubt about that. No proof, but no doubt. 

 We had dinner and hit a hot spot for drinks and dancing. We got back to the hotel around eleven and Millie suggested we stop in the lounge for a night cap. I saw her scan the room looking for Tony and Pete and I saw her lips get tight when she spotted Tony in a booth with Wanda and he had his arm around her and was kissing her. 

 Millie led me to a table and she took the chair that would let her look past me and keep an eye on Tony. We had our drink and talked and if I hadn't known what was going on I'd never have tumbled to the fact that she wasn't sitting there talking to me, but was watching her lover with another woman. We had the one drink and when I asked her if she wanted another she said: 

 "No more booze baby. I want to get up to the room. I'm horny and unless you want to do me here on the table we need to get to a bed." 

 She seemed a little surprised and was a little put out that I didn't eat her pussy like I usually did - no way was I going to eat her after Tony and Pete had fucked her - but she got over it when I fucked her to her first orgasm. She went for my cock to try and get me hard again and tried to get me to go sixty- nine, but I told her I just didn't feel like it so she shrugged and sucked me. She did get me up and we fucked one more time and as I looked down into her face I wondered if it was me she was thinking of as she moaned and cried or was it Tony and/or Pete. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Thursday I hit the bar when I got to the hotel, took a seat at the end of the bar and waited for Phil to wait on me. He set my beer down in front of me and when I put a ten down on the bar to pay for it he looked at it for a couple of seconds and then looked up at me without picking it up. I smiled, took out my wallet and gave him five twenties. He took the money and then said: 

 "What I did was comment on the woman and say that I wished I could land one like her someday and then I asked how she was and the flood gates opened. According to Tony she is a nymphomaniac in the sack. He says she does it all. She sucks cock, fucks in any position you can get her in and she even likes taking it up the butt. He says the only thing she won't do is DPs." 

 "DPs?" 

 "Yeah, you know, double penetrations. She will suck one of them while the other fucks her, but she won't let them do her cunt and ass at the same time." 

 "Did you find out anything I can use to prove to her that I know she was naked and fucking a guy other than her old man?" 

 "Oh yeah. What I did was ask if she had a kinky side. Did she have pierced nipples or a clit ring or something like that and Tony said nothing like that, but that she did have a heart shaped tattoo next to her pussy." 

 Well, there it was. Proof that my wife was a cheating slut. I thanked Phil for the information and headed for my room. For a change Millie was there, dressed and waiting for me when I got there. 

 "Where would you like to go tonight" I asked. I fully expected her to say the hotel restaurant and then the hotel lounge, but she surprised me and said: 

 "Let's see if we can find a good place in the Underground." 

 We did and as I sat across from her eating dinner my head was full of all kinds of shit. I had the anger of a man who was being cheated on, curiosity as to why she cheated and how it had happened so fast, resentment at her seeming desire to socialize with her lovers in front of me and then stir in the fact that I loved the woman and she had kept me very happy for almost a quarter of a century. Take it all and when it was thoroughly mixed pour it in a glass and hold it up to the light and see if you could read it like tea leaves and it would tell you what to do. 

 Millie noticed my silence and said, "You are quiet tonight." 

 "A lot on my mind." 

 "Like what?" 

 "The outcome of this trip." I saw a touch of worry on her face and said, "A lot has happened these last few days while I was in my meetings. Her eyes widened. "I'm not pleased with some of the things I've found out." Her face paled a little as I added, "We will have to see what happens when we get home. There is a very good chance that what happened here this week will have a large impact on my life." 

 Millie lowered her head and picked at her food the rest of the time we were there. When the meal was over I asked her what kind of mood she was in - what kind of music she'd like to dance to - she told me that she would rather just go back to the hotel and make love. As we drove back to the hotel I wondered if she had spent any part of the day with Pete and Tony and just wanted to give me used pussy one more time before we went home. 

 Once in our room we both undressed and when we got on the bed Millie took hold of my cock and as she stroked it she said: 

 "You do know that I love you, don't you?" 

 "I know that you once did." 

 "Why would you say something like that? I've always loved you Rob. I've never stopped and I never will." 

 I gave a non-committal grunt as I slid my cock into her pussy and started fucking her. She was extremely passionate that night and we fucked two more times. I can't speak for Millie, but for my part it was "fucked" and not "made love." As I rolled over and tried to fall asleep I still had no idea of what I was going to do.

 The next morning I told Millie that my morning meeting would be a short one and that I would be back to the hotel by eleven-thirty to check out and catch the hotel courtesy van to the airport. I didn't have a morning meeting. The hotel bar opened at eight and I was the first customer. Phil came over and set a beer down in front of me and I asked him: 

 "What has our girl been up to lately?" 

 "Nothing that I know of. She was by the pool for a couple of hours yesterday and both Tony and Pete talked to her, but she didn't go anywhere with them." Looking over my shoulder he said, "Speak of the devil." 

 I turned and looked and saw Millie getting ready to sit down on one of the lounge chairs. She was wearing the one piece tank suit that I had packed for her instead of the sexy bikini. She hadn't been there twenty minutes when Tony showed up. They talked for a good ten minutes during which time I saw Millie shake her head no several times. Finally Tony shrugged his shoulders, stood up and took something out of his shirt pocket and handed to Millie. She looked at it as he walked away and when he was out of sight she wadded it up and dropped it on the ground. 

 I sat there sipping beer and watching her and an hour and a half later she got up and headed for the elevators. I gave her a ten minute head start and then followed her up to the room. 

 On the way to the airport Millie asked me what I'd meant by the things I had said over dinner the evening before. I tried to make it sound like I wasn't telling the truth when I said: 

 "My presentations didn't seem to be well received and I might have lost a customer or two." 

 She was quiet for the rest of the flight home. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That was two years ago and in the end I did nothing. I never told her what I'd found out. I believed her when she said she loved me and always would. I still have no idea of how or it happened and happened so quickly, but I have accepted that I was partly responsible. I packed all the sexy clothes in her bag which told her I expected her to be sexy on the trip; that I wanted her to loosen up, and she did, only not in the way I expected. 

 The one thing the trip did accomplish was it rekindled our sex life. On any given night I can expect to find Millie waiting for me when I get home from work. She will be standing just inside the door wearing only high heels with a drink for me in one hand while the other hand fingers her pussy - getting it warmed up for me she says. 

 She had a fling and I've accepted that that is all it was and I've put it behind me. I can do that because I keep a very close eye on her now and she has done absolutely nothing that would make me even slightly suspicious that she is cheating on me now that we are back home. 

 I stare at Candy's ass and think, "I'm owed a fling" and God knows that I am tempted, but there is that evil spell that has been cast over me and the fact that I come hard-wired from the factory unable to do anything to defeat it. I watch Candy walk away and wonder again why I'm not like most of the other men I know. Report_Story
