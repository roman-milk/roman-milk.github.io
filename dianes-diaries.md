Diane's Diaries
===============

===

I was sitting at my desk at work and looking at my co-workers. There were sixteen of us the large open area. The boss didn't like cubicles; he said that they cut down on employee interaction and he thought it inhibited productivity. I was sitting there looking at the nine men and seven women – there used to be thirteen men, but that comes later in the story – and I wondered if the men were like me and the women like my wife. What secrets were there that I couldn't see? Were the men as clueless as I had been? Were the five married women cheating on their husbands? Were the two single women spreading for some other woman's husband? What brought out that curiosity? That's the story. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Diane and I met during our last year in college. We were both business majors, but somehow in a little over three years we had never had a class together. The first time I saw her was on the first day of Business Strategies. I thought she was a damned good looking lady, but then I put her out of my mind. Not that I didn't think that she would be nice to date, but I was semi spoken for. I had a more or less steady girlfriend and she met my needs just fine and yes I do mean that like it sounded. 

 Mae and I were 'fuck buddies' pure and simple. There was no undying love and devotion, just a lot of sex. We were never going to get married and we knew it. The reason we were only going 'more or less steady' is because every so often Mae would wander away to try out the cock of some other guy who had caught her eye and when she would tire of him she would come back to me until 'wanderlust' took her again. She wouldn't marry me, even though she claimed she loved me, because she wanted to be free to go after cocks if the mood took her. I wouldn't marry her, although in most respects she was perfect for me, because she would always be dropping her panties for some other guy, but we got along well together so I saw no reason to make any changes until we graduated and went our separate ways. 

 I had nothing to do with Diane except for nodding hello politely as we passed in the hall or entering or leaving the classroom. Then, about mid-term the class was split up into groups of five or six and assigned projects. Diane and I ended up in the same group. The group divided up what needed to be done to complete the project and Diane and I ended up working together. 

 We met a few times in the library or school cafeteria and then one day as we were in the library doing some research she asked me if I was doing anything on Friday night and I said I wasn't and then she asked me if I could do her a favor. 

 "What kind of a favor?" 

 "I need a date for a party I want to go to Friday night." 

 "You're kidding me!" 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "Get serious Diane. Guys should be lined up at your door begging you for dates so what is with you having to ask a guy?" 

 "I don't have a line outside my door. I had a fiancé up until two days ago and most of the guys who know me don't know that Jack and I have broken up." 

 "And you can't just go alone?" 

 "I could, but I would be projecting the wrong image." 

 "And that would be?" 

 "A woman who couldn't get on with her life and had to dog her ex and look pathetic." 

 "Tell me what I'm getting myself into if I say yes." 

 "I caught jack screwing one of my sorority sisters and I threw my ring into his face. Jack will be at the party either with that bitch Cyndi or some other skank. If I am there alone I'll have to put up with Jack's smirk and looks of pity from everyone else there. If I don't go at all the word will go out that I'm all heart-broken. I can't give that asshole the pleasure. I need a date so I can show that he is nothing to me anymore and that I'm getting on with my life with a new beau." 

 "I haven't even said yes yet and I've already been promoted from date to beau?" 

 "Please?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 During class and when we worked on our project I'd never seen Diane is anything except baggy pants and loose sweaters and sweatshirts. I knew she was a fox from the neck up, but I was not prepared for vision that came down the stairs when I picked her up at her sorority house. Tight, but not trashy. Nice cleavage, but not enough to look slutty. The skirt was short, but not too short. The heels were high, but not too high. I took in the sight and figured that this Jack guy was an idiot to have been messing with another girl when he had what was walking toward me. I gave the proper 'wolf whistle' and got a one thousand watt smile in return. I gave her my arm and we headed off. 

 As we drove to the party Diane told me not to be surprised if she hung all over me and I told her to hang all she wanted and I was thinking that if I could parlay this party into several more dates I would be seeing a lot less of Mae. 

 The party was a typical college bash. A room cleared of furniture to make a dance floor; a bowl of non-alcoholic punch that would be spiked before the party was an hour old and a beer keg in the corner. I noticed a lot of eyes on us when we walked in and I noticed one guy with a look of surprise on his face. I whispered: 

 "At your four o'clock in the blue shirt." 

 She looked up at me and smiled and whispered back, "Yep, that's asshole." 

 We when to the keg and got a beer and then we walked around. I knew a few of the people there and Diane introduced me to a dozen more. We set our beers down and moved out onto the floor. It was a slow number and Diane pulled me close, pressed her tits into my chest and licked my right ear lobe. It sent shivers down my spine and my cock twitched. She felt it and smiled at me. 

 Out of the corner of my eye I saw blue shirt watching with a scowl on his face. I kept an eye on him and noticed that he made several trips to the beer keg. I wondered if he was trying to drown his sorrows over letting Diane get away or if he was trying to build up his courage to do something. I didn't have long to wait to find out. 

 An hour after we arrived I saw him chug his beer, put the cup down and head for us. We were on the dance floor swaying to a slow tune. Diane was plastered to me and had her hands on my ass pulling me into her and blue shirt walked up, grabbed Diane's arm and said: 

 "Come on Di, we're getting out of here." 

 "Get your hands off of me asshole." 

 "Oh come on Di? You know it didn't mean nothing. Just some fooling around. Nothing was gonna happen." 

 "Bullshit! Cyndi was bragging the next day about how she took you from me and she told everybody that you told her she was better in bed than me." 

 "I told you that it didn't mean nothing. Now come on, let's go." 

 He grabbed her arm again and I slapped his hands away. "Get your hands off my girl asshole." 

 "Your girl? In only two days? Don't make me laugh. All she is is a date. She is my fiancé." 

 "Not the way I heard it. She caught you cheating on her and told you to fuck off and die. And I thank you for that. She wouldn't be my girl now if you hadn't fucked up." 

 "Bullshit! I know her. It took me a month to get the first kiss and she's your girl in only two days? Again dude, bullshit! She probably doesn't even know your full name. She picked you up for this party to rub my nose in it." 

 "I told you that I had you to thank for it. She was so pissed at you for what you did that she said yes when I asked her out and she gave it up on the first date. Told me up front that she was only doing it to get back at you and that she was going to let you know about it the next day. Funny thing though; she liked it so much that we haven't stopped." 

 "No way man. She's not that way. I know her well enough to know that even if she did do you on your first date to get back at me she's too inhibited to keep on doing it." 

 "Again dude, I've got you to thank for it. If she would have had a decent lover before maybe she wouldn't be my girl now. But again I have to thank you. You never got the job done so it was a big surprise to her when she found somebody to show her how it was really supposed to be. Hell man; once I got past the used part and started touching her where she had never been touched before she went nuts and couldn't get enough. She won't leave me alone and I'm glad because I've never had a woman as hot as she is." 

 He swung at me and I'd been waiting for it. I blocked his swing, stepped inside and drove my fist deep into his gut and he grabbed his stomach and fell to the floor. I looked down at him and then turned to Diane. 

 "You have anything you want to add honey?" 

 "No. He is pretty pathetic. He can't fuck and he can't fight. I don't know what I even saw in him in the first place. I'm well rid of him. I'm horny baby; get me out of here." 

 Once in the car she asked me why I had said all those things. "I wanted to goad him into taking a swing at me. I was having a good time and I wasn't going to keep on having a good time unless I got rid of him. He would have screwed with us all night if I would have let him." 

 "But you made me sound like an easy slut." 

 "So what? After my little speech every man in that room is going to be thinking of you. Your dance card will always be full from now on. You will have to beat the guys off with a stick. You will be able to pick and chose. Just do a better job of it next time." 

 "What next time? You just told half of the people that I know that I'm your girl." 

 She slid over next to me and put her hand on my leg. 

 "He was telling the truth you know. It did take him a month to get his first kiss and another six months before I gave him my virginity." 

 She put her hand on the hard bulge inside my trousers. "It isn't going to take my new boyfriend anywhere as near as long. My sorority house is out so do you have a place? I'm especially interested in that part about being touched where I've never been touched before." 

 "That was just talk to crank him up. I have no idea if it might be true or not." 

 "Then we just have to find out don't we." 

 I took my time undressing her and I licked and sucked on her breasts and rubbed her pussy until she moaned. I gently pushed her down on the bed and feasted on the sight of her lying there spread out and waiting. As I undressed she said: 

 "I'm really not this kind of girl. I'm not the kind to give it up this quick. I made Jack wait six months and I thought I loved him. I barely even know you, but for some reason I feel that I have to do this. Can you understand that?" 

 "No. All I know is that the sexiest woman I have ever seen is lying on a bed waiting for me and regardless of why she is doing it I am not going to waste the chance of tasting heaven." 

 I got on the bed and began licking and sucking her tits and then I slowly kissed and licked my way down her body, across her flat stomach, stopping to rim her belly button and then on to her pussy. She moaned and pushed her hips up at me and I worked my fingers into her and worked on her. Her moans were louder and her hips drove at my hands and then she stiffened and cried out as my mouth found her 'little man in the boat." She dug her fingers into my hair and pulled me tight to her as she moaned and whimpered. I kept licking and sucking until my cock couldn't stand being inactive anymore. I pulled my face out of her hot pot and moved up. My cock slid into her like a hot knife into butter and she went wild on me. She bucked and thrashed, and pushed and kept crying out and moaning until suddenly she went stiff as a board on me, cried out "OH MY GOD" and started shaking like she had chills and a high fever. One more cry, "Oh fuck! Oh sweet Jesus" and she went limp on me. 

 I didn't know if she had passed out or what, but I was seconds away from my own release so I kept fucking. Just as I was about a second from cumming her legs came up and gripped me and her arms came up and went around my neck and she moaned: 

 "Do it! Do it baby; cum in me give it to me cum in me" and I did. I felt her pussy try to grip me and hold me, but I kept pumping until I was too soft to make it go in anymore. I finally pulled out and fell to the bed next to her. 

 "Oh my God" she murmured, "I never knew." 

 There were several moments of silence and then she said, "You didn't lie baby. You touched something that has never been touched before. Jack never made that happen. How long before we can go again?" 

 "On my own? Twenty minutes to a half hour." 

 "If I help?" 

 "Maybe ten." 

 She slid down, took my cock in her mouth and had me ready in five. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When it was over and we were dressing she asked, "I never asked. Do you have anyone special? Am I going to have to fight to keep you?" 

 "No one special, but why would you want to keep me?" 

 "You just turned this poor girl inside out and you have to ask?" 

 "I'm no one special sweetie. Any man who wants to make it good for the woman as well as himself will do the same." 

 "Doesn't matter. You told everyone that I was your girl and I don't want anyone to think that you are a liar and I can't just drop you and have everyone thinking that Jack was right and that I was only with you to rub his nose in it. There is a small problem though." 

 "What?" 

 "Jack was probably doing others behind my back besides Cyndi and after hearing your little speech last night they are probably going to want to see for themselves if what you said was true. Especially the part about touching places that Jack never had. I'm going to have to fight them off right? Or am I?" 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "It won't do me a lot of good to try and fight them off if what you want is to give then a try." 

 "Not to worry sweetie. With the exception of Mae I don't have anyone else. I'm usually a one woman man." 

 "Who is Mae?" 

 I explained my relationship with Mae to her and then said, "If you are serious about saddling yourself with me I'll tell Mae that we are over." 

 "Just don't go giving her 'one to remember me by.' You are mine now." 

 "Yes dear. Whatever you say dear." 

 "Asshole!" 

 "Yes dear." 

 Four months later we graduated and five months after that we were married. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We decided to wait on kids until we were financially stable and then we set out on our careers. Diane did not like the feel of condoms so she went on birth control pills and backed them up with a diaphragm. We both did well with me rising to district manager and Diane becoming her boss's personal assistant which, as she explained to me when I kidded her about getting a degree just to become a glorified secretary, was as close as you could get to being a vice president without having the actual title. 

 The only down side to our success was that we both had to travel as part of our jobs. I was gone at least eight days a month visiting the offices in my district and Diane would be gone once or twice a month when she accompanied her boss to meetings or negotiations. 

 We were close to making the same money and had started saving for a house. On our eighth anniversary we bought ourselves a four bedroom house in a pretty good neighborhood and set a target date for starting our family. On our tenth anniversary the birth control pills and the diaphragm would go into the trash can. 

 It was one week after our ninth anniversary when it all came apart. Diane was in Pittsburg with her boss and my car started acting up and I took it into the dealer to have it looked at. Rather than rent a car I took a cab over to Diane's office. She had ridden to the airport with her boss and had left her car in the company parking lot. I used my set of keys to unlock it and then drove it home. 

 Diane and I had different tastes in music so I decided to take her music out of the CD player and put mine in. The CD unit was under the passenger's seat and I opened the back door and took a knee. I pushed the button on the player that ejected the cartridge that held the six CDs, put it on the floor and then slid my music into the slot. As I picked up Diane's CDs I saw something wedged between the driver's seat and the center console. I pulled it out and saw that it was a journal or diary of some kind. I opened it and on the flyleaf I read 

 "Number 6. May of 04 to......" 

 I had no idea that Diane kept a diary. This was volume 6 and went back six months to May. I wondered when volume 1 started. I quickly thumbed through the pages and saw that the book was half full. Six months and half full would seem to indicate that the book would hold a years worth so if the other volumes were the same size Diane must have started keeping a diary five and a half years ago, Five and a half years and I didn't know? I debated reading what was there and then said no. It was her diary and her private thoughts and it would have been an invasion of her privacy. If she wanted me to know she was keeping a diary she would have told me. 

 I went to slide it back where I found it just as a wasp flew through the open door and I swatted at it and dropped the book. It fell to the floor and landed in the open position and when I bent to pick it up the words "pulled out his cock' leaped up from the page at me. I stared at it for a second or two and then I picked it up and read the page. The entry was from the previous Sunday – the day before she flew out to Pittsburg with her boss. 

 "I was a nasty girl again. We had a barbecue today and had several people over. About two hours into the party we ran out of ice and hubby left to get some more. Ben, the only one of hubby's coworkers we associated with who had never fooled around with me, came up to me as soon as hubby was gone and asked me why I had done things with Dan, Rich and Andy, but not him. I was horny so I led him into the house and locked us in the upstairs bathroom. I lifted my top and bra and told him to suck my breasts. He squeezed, licked and sucked them while I unzipped him and pulled out his cock. I went to my knees and went to work on him with my hands, lips and tongue. He fucked my mouth until he came and then I told him I'd fuck him the next time hubby leaves town" 

 I knelt there and stared at the page. It had to be a joke! It just had to be. Diane couldn't have done that. She loved me. I know she did. There had to be a reasonable explanation for what I was holding in my hand. She liked reading porn stories on a couple of Internet sites so maybe she was trying to write one of her own to send in. It had to be something like that. It just had to be. 

 I stood up and went into the house and got a cup of coffee, sat down at the kitchen table and turned to the first page. 

 "May 2, 08. A good trip to Denver. Donny (her boss) set me up with Marcus and Alan and I came through for the company again. I fucked the both of them into exhaustion and they signed on the dotted line. That makes five closings for me this year already. I'm on track to beat last years nine. Then – "giggle, giggle" – Donny took his soppy seconds." 

 I moved ahead to August. 

 "Aug 4, 08. Hubby gone this week. Donny and four of his friends came over to keep me company. My God, I must be a nymphomaniac. I just can not get enough. I wore out the five of them. I asked Donny to bring more with him the next time." 

 "Aug 5, 08. Went to lunch with Jim Carstairs. An afternoon in room 416 got me a signed contract. I really enjoyed getting that signature. Jim has a nine inch cock – the biggest one I've ever seen. I told him he could call me any time he was in town and I'd find some way to get to him. He gave me his number and told me to call him anytime I was in Salt Lake and you can be damned sure that I will. Nine inches – MY GOD!" 

 I put the diary in my briefcase, finished my coffee and then headed for work. I had some time mid-morning and I took out Diane's book and opened it. 

 "Sept 9, 08. I was bad, really bad tonight. I had to work late (well, not really – Donny wanted a blow job before we closed the office) and I called hubby to let him know I'd be late. He said no problem since he had to work late also. I finished Donny and then thought I'd go over to hubby's office and if he was close to being done maybe we could go out for some dinner together. When I got there Hubby was already gone. Rich was still at his desk and he told me that hubby had left half an hour ago (I gave Donny a long, long, long blow job) then he stood up and took out his cock and told me it had been a month since I'd last fucked him. I walked over to hubby's desk, pushed everything to one side, took off my panties and got on the desk. Rich was fucking me hard and I was moaning and telling him to fuck me harder.

I looked over and saw Amos, the colored janitor watching. I'd never had a black cock before so I waved him over and told him to take it out. I opened my mouth and he put it in. I was a little disappointed. I'd always heard that black men had large cocks, but Amos's cock wasn't any bigger that Rich's and it didn't taste any different than a white cock. Rich came in me and then I had Amos take his place. He didn't fuck any different than a white man either. There was a puddle of cum on hubby's desk when I got up and I thought of leaving it there so hubby could look at it and wonder what it was, but decided not too. I gave Amos some tongue and made him promise that what we did would be our secret and that maybe some day we could do it again. 

 When I got home hubby was in the basement working on one of his woodworking projects and I did a quick clean up job and then hubby and I went to bed and made love. I just love giving hubby used pussy and kissing him after I've had some other man's cock in my mouth and swallowed his cum. I'm just such a bad little slut." 

 I took the book to the copier and copied all the pages. That night I put the book back where I found it, drove her car back to where I'd picked it up and parked it in the same spot. I cabbed over to the dealership and picked up my car and drove home. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 After heating up some leftovers in the microwave and eating I went looking for the other five diaries. I didn't waste any time on our bedroom or the garage because I was sure that she wouldn't hide them in any place where I spent any amount of time and I didn't think she would use the basement storage area because I did occasionally go down there to look for things. I went through the spare bedrooms and even went so far as to take the covers off of the heating vents and cold air returns, but didn't find anything. 

 You needed to bring in the eight foot ladder from the garage to get up into the attic and I hadn't been up there in years so that is where I went next. The attic is where we stored stuff that we never needed. There was blown insulation between the joists and we had put down 4x8 sections of plywood to make a floor over the insulation. It wasn't nailed down, just placed down so we could stack boxes on top of it. I went through everything and found nothing and I was getting ready to go look somewhere else when something caught my eye. The last time I had been up there all of the pieces of plywood had several boxes stacked on top of them, but now there was one piece that only had two small boxes on it. I moved the boxes and lifted the sheet of plywood and there they were. I gathered up the five books and took them down into the kitchen. 

 I leafed through the books until I found the one that said Volume 1. The flyleaf said Volume 1, April 99 to May 01. The first entry was April 4th. 

 "Dear diary. Oh shit! That is no way to start this. There is nothing "dear' about it. What this is is a confessional. I need to tell somebody, but there is no one I can tell without ruining my life. My outlet has to be these pages. Instead of writing it in this book I should be telling it to my husband and begging him for forgiveness, but I know if I told him what happened he would be out the door and on his way to being my ex-husband or possibly on his way to jail. Where to start. Stupid question Di, start at the beginning. Not at the beginning of what happened, but where what led to it began. 

 "It started when Donny called e into his office and told me that he wanted to make me his personal assistant. I told him no thanks, that I hadn't worked my butt off just to become a glorified secretary. He told me that I wouldn't be doing the work of a super secretary. He wanted some one to handle negotiations when he wasn't around; some one more familiar with the cost and control end of things to help keep him from giving the store away and blah, blah, blah. The job paid a third more than I was making so I took it. 

 "The first six weeks were okay. I flew to Detroit, Miami, Atlanta and Kansas City with him and sat in on contract talks. Twice I stepped in and saved him from making a huge error on costs and once he had to leave and fly back to handle an emergency and I ended up finishing the negotiations and getting the signed contract. I was on top of the world. Then came the trip to Philadelphia. We spent the day talking with the people from Tentron and that night Darrel, Sam and George from Tentron took us to dinner. We stopped at the hotel bar for a couple of drinks and someone, probably Donny, put something in one of my drinks. I woke up with Sam eating my pussy and Darrel and George sucking on my breasts. I was confused and didn't know what was happening and by the time I figured it out Sam was fucking me. Between Sam eating my pussy and the other two working on my breasts I was on fire and I gave into it and all three fucked me. It was one right after another and I never got a chance to come down from my orgasmic high until they were done with me. Darrel and George had me twice and Sam took me three times. The next afternoon the boys from Tentron signed the contract. 

 "It was a set up from the start. Donny explained it to me. Sam had seen me when he had visited our plant and he told Donny that for a night with me he would give us all of his business instead of what we had. Donny thought he was joking, but Sam assured Donny that he wasn't. Since Tentron's business would be worth six million a year to the company Donny said he would find some way to make it happen. The promotion to personal assistant was just to get me where I could travel with him on company business. Donny had taped the whole thing and told me that I was going to spend the night with Sam and that I had damned well better treat him right if I didn't want the tape to go public. 

 I hesitated and he said by public he meant my mom and dad and all of my other relatives, neighbors and so on. If I could have talked to hubby I know I could have convinced him that I didn't do it on purpose, but Donny didn't give me the time to call Henry. He told me that Sam was upstairs in room 412 and was expecting me in five minutes and told me that if I wasn't on my way up in three I could get my story ready for my mother. I couldn't let my mother see me with a cock in my pussy and one in my mouth. It wouldn't matter if she believed my story or not I could not, just could not let her see that tape. Donny told me not to whine about it. He said I was making great money as his PA and since I was pretty much responsible for getting all of Tentron's business I was going to get a sizeable bonus. I spent the night with Sam and in the morning Donny told me that the next night was his. Just that quick I became the company whore." 

 Apparently Diane only made entries when she cheated on me because the next entry wasn't until the middle of May 

 "May 16, 2001. The trip to Baltimore this week cemented my new relationship with Donny. He gave me to Phil from Argus Industries and I was Phil's fuck toy for two of the three nights we were there. The third night was Donny's. Between the trips and the fucking on the couch in is office Donny is getting almost as much as my hubby. I HATE IT and I promise myself that I'm just going to lay there, but once it gets started I can't seem to play dead. I always end up getting into it. I feel so guilty afterward. I do get back at Donny a little. When he comes in my mouth I always spit it out into a tissue. It isn't much as revenge goes, but at least it is something." 

 "June 7, 2001. "I've was given my wings. I was sent solo to San Diego to negotiate with Spencer Aeronautics. A day of talking, a night of fucking, another day of talking and another night of fucking and I closed a deal worth 1.4 million for the company. I hate to say it, but I am beginning to enjoy the variety. I've had short fat ones, long skinny ones, two long fat ones and two that made me want to laugh." 

 "June 15, 01. Today I did an evil thing. I am ashamed of having done it to the man I love, but at the same time it was a major, major turn on. Jared (Spritzer and Company) had me call my hubby while he was fucking me. I was actually telling my hubby that I loved him at the exact instant that that Jared came in me. I have to make it up to hubby. Maybe I can find some way to give him my ass. He has always wanted it, but I've always said no. It is only a matter of time before some one I have to fuck for the company will insist on having my ass. It is only fair that my hubby gets it first and not after somebody else has it." 

 So that's why she finally gave me a trip up the Hershey highway. She told me that it was because all of her girlfriends did it and talked about it over drinks so she decided to give it a try. The only reason I wanted to try it is because I had never done it and I was curious and wanted to see what it was like. It was okay, but nothing to whine over if I couldn't have it and I didn't think Diane liked it at all, but as I read on I discovered otherwise. 

 "Aug 12, 2001. A four day three night trip to Chicago. The fucking usual. Talk all day and fuck all night. Myron on Monday night, Al on Tuesday and of course Donny had to get his on Wednesday. I'm so sick of it, but Donny has made it clear that quitting the job will trigger everyone finding out just as a refusal would. Only good part was that Al is an ass man and he fucked my butt three times before we dressed and went to breakfast. I like it so much. I wonder why hubby hasn't wanted to do it again?" 

 Probably my unfaithful whore it was because I never knew. If you liked it so fucking much maybe, just fucking maybe, you should have let me know. You just moaned and groaned. How was I supposed to know it wasn't from pain instead of pleasure? I tossed the book aside, went and took a whiz, got a beer from the fridge and came back. I leafed through volumes 2 and 3 and it was just more of the same. I picked up volume 4 and about halfway through it I noticed a change. Diane was getting more descriptive. Volumes 1, 2, 3 and the first half of 4 were just simple "I went to __________, fucked__________, got the contract and Donny got his sloppy seconds" but in the second half of volume 4 things started to change. 

 "Nov 9. Des Moines this time. Another solo trip. My meeting was with Archie Moore from Spacik Manufacturing. When we broke for lunch Archie told me that he had talked to Donny before I got there and Donny had told him that I would "sweeten the pot." I told him that our prices were competitive, our quality control was unsurpassed and our reputation for meeting shipping dates was the best in the industry, but I could show my appreciation for a signed contract. He told me he would sign as soon as we returned from lunch. I had expected to be there two days before getting a signature if I even got a signature. 

 "Archie had a very nice cock. It was a little shorter than hubby's but it was almost twice as fat. And it did have a nice plum sized head that was very sensitive. He went nuts when I licked it. He liked to eat pussy too and he was very good at it. He did me missionary first and then we went into a sixty-nine to get him ready again. Doggie the second time and then more of the magic number. Third time I rode him cowgirl. He nailed me again the next morning when we woke up. He wanted my ass, but I wouldn't give it to him. His cock was just too damned fat and while I do so love my butt plugged I didn't want the pain that taking his huge cock would give me. I told him maybe next time. I had figured on being there two days and two nights so 'next time' turned out to be that night. He kept after me for my ass so I told him he could have it, but only if he worked on it long enough with KY and fingers to get it open enough that his fat cock wouldn't kill me or tear me. 

 It WAS FANTASTIC!!!! 

 I had never been so full and I came and came and came. He came and we washed his cock and I sucked him hard and he went right back into my ass. Four times! It was the first time that I fucked all night and never had a cock in my pussy. Mouth and ass only. For the first time I was glad that hubby didn't seem to want my ass. If he had wanted it when I got home he probably would have been able to put his fist in there." 

 "May 6. Andy told Rich about doing me on hubby's desk and Rich called me and said he wanted some too. I laughed at him and he told me I wouldn't be laughing after he told hubby about me and Andy. I met him after work and he took me to a Motel 6. He had to settle for some head and one quick fuck because I needed to get home. He told me that I had better find some time to treat him right or I'd be sorry. God! Will this never fucking end?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I wasn't going to bother reading volume 5 since I figured that it would just be more of the same. I was leafing through the pages though when something caught my eye. About ten pages into the book in big, bold underlined letters was "I'M FREE! THANK GOD I AM FREE!! 

 "Dec 4. I'm free, thank God I am free. John, Donny's father and the owner of the company called me into his office and then told me to close the door which I thought odd because he had never had a closed door meeting with anyone in the entire time I had worked there. He told me that it had been brought to his attention that I was performing unethical business practices to get business and he would not allow it to continue. He was sorry, but he couldn't have anyone like me representing the company that he had spent his life building and he was going to have to let me go. I should have been relived that I had a way to leave where Donny couldn't follow through on his threat. He couldn't hold it against me for going if his father fired me. But I got indignant. No way was I going to take the heat that his son caused to be put on me. I told John the whole story from the first time up to the last and why I'd had to do what I had done. He was shocked, but not overly surprised. He either knew his son well enough to know that it was something Donny would do or well enough to know that Donny would say: 

 "Who me? Bullshit. She's just trying to save her job by lying." 

 He called Donny into the office and before Donny could say a word John told him that he wanted everything that Donny was using against me on his desk no later than three that afternoon. Tapes, photos, originals, copies, whatever, on his desk by three. I guess from his father's tone Donny knew to keep his mouth shut and just do it. He left and then John apologized for his original attitude toward me. He told me to came back and see him at three-thirty. 

 At three-thirty he handed me three video tapes and five CDs. He told me that he was moving Donny into production and asked me if I would like to have Donny's job. I would have loved to have Donny's job, but I had to turn it down and explain why. In Donny's job I would be dealing with the same people Donny was forcing me to sleep with and they would expect more of the same treatment. If I didn't provide it I could cost the company the business that I had previously brought in. John said he saw my point and asked me what job I would like. I told him Accounts Manager and John told me to consider it done. 

 Sorry dear diary, but this is my last entry. I destroyed the material that John gave me and now I can get on with my life." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 But it wasn't her last entry. 

 "Mar 6. Damn, damn, damn and fucking God damn! John had a fatal heart attack and now Donny sits in the big chair. He called me into his office and turned his lap top to where I could see the screen and asked me if I had fond memories of it. It was me being fucked by Darrel. Donny laughed and asked me if I was really so naïve that I believed he had given his father anything but copies of what he had on me? Then he told me to lock the door and then crawl over to him and suck his cock. I am the company whore again." 

 The next forty pages were more of the "I flew, I talked, I fucked' variety with flat descriptions of who and how. The big change came in the second week of June. 

 "June 16. I hadn't made a trip in three weeks and I was restless so I told hubby I would be gone on a one night trip and I went out to the airport and sat in the hotel bar and waited for some one suitable to pick me up. It was almost forty minutes before some one I thought I could be interested in hit on me. We talked and I told him that I was in town overnight on business and he said he was in the same boat. Two drinks later he asked me if I would like to join him in his room and I said yes, took his arm and told him to lead the way. We sucked and fucked until we got tired and then we slept until morning and when we woke up we sucked and fucked until he had to leave to catch his flight home. He gave me his cell number and told me if I was ever in Kansas City to give him a call and I told him that I would. And I will. His cock was the perfect size for pounding my butt hole. 

 "I don't know what is wrong with me. I just can not seem to get enough strange cock any more. I'm getting to where I love getting fucked by men other than my hubby. I always feel guilty afterwards for what I've done to my hubby, but I can't seem to stop. I love him to death and he deserves so much better than a whore like me. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the next six months she serviced over fourteen different men as she flew around negotiating for her company. Twice she picked up strangers in the bars of the hotels she stayed in. At her company Christmas party she slipped away for a quickie with Donny and at my company Christmas party she managed to slip away four times and give Andy, Ben, Rich and Dan their Christmas gifts. 

 After that she started doing two or three others to every one customer she did. On my trips she was having men over to the house; sometimes one, sometimes two and some times lots more. Twice she did the four assholes from my office all at the same time and once she had my cousin Tom over for the night. According to the diary entry I was on my district swing and he dropped by to borrow my cutting torch. He was used to just walking into the house and when he did he caught Diane bending over the back of the couch taking Donny up her ass. She told him to bring his cock over to her mouth and then he could take Donny's place in her butt when Donny was through. According to the diary he had hesitated a moment or so before taking out his cock and stepping forward. 

 As I sat there and read that I was pissed. He was family for fucks sake. He should have called her a sorry assed whore and then called me on my cell and filled me in, but even as I had that thought I knew better. If I had walked in on a stone fox like Diane getting fucked and she had invited me to take the open hole I can honestly say that I probably would have. But, I told myself, I would have called and confessed after it was over. Or maybe that was just me being high-minded. 

 The one thing that I never understood was how she could be putting out so much and still be fucking me to death. I saw no loss of love and affection and even though I knew from her journals that she got a huge kick out of coming to me after one of her lovers it did not seem to affect her love for me one little bit. According to her diaries, which she knew I would never see, she loved me to death and did not do it to demean me by it. She did it because it turned her on so much that she was able to (her words) "Rock my hubby's world." 

 It might not have affected her love for me, but I was afraid that I couldn't say the same. 

 I took her journals with me to work the next day and copied them and then I put them back just the way I'd found them. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When Diane got home I did my best to act normal. Diane's diaries wouldn't mean shit as evidence because she could claim that they were just her fantasies put down on paper and that she never really did any of those things. If I tried to use them in court against her as part of a divorce she could even claim that they weren't even hers at all and that I had made them up.  

 

 

===

Fortunately there was a way and Diane's freewheeling sex life would make it easy. A half hour conversation and a check for three thousand dollars got the house wired for audio and video by Absolute Investigations and then all I needed to do was wait for my next trip to visit my district. 

 Diane made two trips during the wait, but I didn't get to read her diary entries. On both trips I went over to where her car was parked, but the diary wasn't there. I guess she took it on her trips with her and I had just gotten lucky that she had forgotten it the time that I found it. 

 When she was home I acted as though there was no problem and our life was fine, but I guess I wasn't as good an actor as I thought. I wasn't proud of myself and it was pretty underhanded of me, but I wanted a look at the latest entries in her diary. I dissolved two sleeping tablets in the wine she drank for dinner and after doing the dishes she took me to the bedroom and did her best to destroy me. When she fell asleep I waited half an hour and then shook her to see if she would wake up. She as totally zonked. 

 I went out to her car and searched it but the book wasn't there. I came back into the house and checked out the suitcases that she used on her trips and found nothing. Then I noticed her makeup case and that's where I found it. She had made a slit in the lining of the lid and pushed the book into it. There were nine entries since the last time I read it. All fairly descriptive, but still the "I flew, I talked and I fucked" type entries, but the last one surprised me. She described her two evenings with a guy named Barry and ended the entry with: 

 "Something is wrong. Hubby has been acting funny lately; almost as if he suspects something. Have I slipped up somehow? I've looked back and I can't think of anything I might have done to get him thinking bad thoughts. I wish I knew for sure. If he knows I'd like to end things on my terms. Tell Donny to fuck off and die and let him out me to everyone. Everyone would find out anyway if hubby knows and dumps me. Damn it! I don't want to lose him. I got into this mess to keep him from finding out and leaving me. Shit! Shit! Shit!" 

 I tucked the journal back where I'd found it and then went to bed. 

 The next morning at breakfast Diane asked me if anything was wrong and I asked her why she'd asked. She told me that she had noticed that something was bothering me. Given as many lies as she had been telling me I didn't feel the least bit sorry for lying to her. I told her that another company was trying to take over my company and that if it happened I would probably lose my job. She told me not to worry, that she made enough to carry us until I could find something else. Then she said that the important thing was that we would always have each other and that was all that counted. If she really meant that she was in for a huge let down when I lowered the boom on her. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 My travel week came up and she kissed me goodbye and told me that she would eagerly be awaiting my return. She told me that she would be so horny by the time I goy back that I might not survive the weekend. 

 It was bad. 

 Seeing her on Monday night with Donny had me wanting to kill him with my bare hands. Tuesday it was Ben from work. Wednesday it was all four of the assholes I worked with and I saw my wife with a cock in all three useable holes at the same time. She could write in her diaries all she wanted that she hated herself for doing it, but it was obvious to me that when she was doing it she was loving every second, every touch, every thrust and stroke, every kiss and every mouthful of cum she swallowed. There was on bright spot for me. Andy had his cock in her mouth and he said he was sure glad I couldn't take care of her in bed or he never would have gotten a taste and Diane bit his cock. He screamed and jerked his cock out of her mouth. She told him to get the fuck out of her house if he was going to bad mouth me. 

 "There isn't a damned thing wrong with the way he takes care of me in bed. It isn't his fault that I love to fuck and need it when he isn't around." 

 Did it turn me on? Yes it did, but stronger than the sexual turn on was the rage I felt toward Diane and all the men I watched use her. I promised myself that I would get even and my getting even would not be painless as far as they were concerned. The men anyway. I didn't think it was in me to ever physically hurt a woman; not even Diane regardless of what she did to me. But I would hurt her. She couldn't bear to lose me? She didn't know it yet, but I was already gone. 

 Diane would be on the back burner for a while. I intended to settle my debt with the four assholes I worked with before letting Diane know she was busted. Donny would get a temporary free ride. Diane was going to need a job when it was over so I had to leave him in place until Diane didn't need him anymore and then he would get his. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The problem facing me was that there wasn't any way I could go after Dan, Andy, Ben and Rich one at a time. As soon as I did the first one the others would be on alert. I was going to have to go straight at them as a group, but how to do it? I spent a good week thinking about it and no matter what I came up with I saw me going to jail as the end result. Then I got to thinking about that. What did it matter if I spent some time behind bars? Once I took care of the assholes I would have to quit my job anyway since there was no way I could ever work with them again. If I was in jail Diane would know she was the cause of it and that might make her lose sleep. 

 But it could go the other way also. Dan and Rich were married and Ben was engaged to be married and they just might keep quiet to keep their women from finding out. Andy was single, but maybe the others would put pressure on him to keep his mouth shut. I decided that I needed to just say "Fuck it!" and do it and let the chips fall wherever they fell. 

 I flew to San Diego and bought a used two door Pontiac under an assumed name and drove it home. I did some work on it to get it suited for the role it was going to play and then I went after "the gang of four." I picked Andy to approach since he was the one who seemed to think I couldn't handle Diane and would therefore be more likely to think of me as a wimp. I told him that I had a personal problem I thought he could help me with and I asked him if he would have lunch with me so I could talk with him about it. Over lunch I hemmed and hawed and finally told him that I'd long had a fantasy of watching Diane being gangbanged. I told him that I had finally gotten her to agree to do it at least once. I told him that I had seen the way he had eyed her at company parties and picnics and then I asked him if he would be interested in helping me out. I could read it on his face. 

 "You poor wimpy bastard. You talked her into doing it once? God are you clueless." 

 He said he would love a shot at Diane and then I asked him if he could find three more guys. He told me no problem, that there were three more guys at work who would jump at the chance and that the four of them talked about how hot Diane was every time they got together around the water cooler. Then he asked me if I could handle working with four guys who had just fucked my wife. "I already am you asswipe" I thought to myself as I told him that I didn't expect any problems since if it went right I would probably join in and if Diane liked it we would do it again as often as we could. He told me he would sound out the others and get back to me. 

 Next morning he told me that he had talked to Dan, Rick and Ben and that they were all for it. I told him that I wanted all four of them to go to lunch with me so we could work out the details. At lunch time I told them all to get in my car so we could talk on the way to the restaurant. I headed away from downtown and Dan asked me where I was going and I named a place just outside of town and told him I had coupons for buy one lunch and get one free. I told him the least I could do was buy them lunch for doing me the favor I had asked of them. In my rear view I saw Ben look at Rich and smirk. 

 Just outside of town I pulled into a rest area and told Andy who was sitting in the front with me to open the package on the seat next to me. He opened it and found seven sets of handcuffs. He looked at me and saw the gun I was point at him. I told him to keep two pair and hand the rest to Ben in the back seat. He asked what I was going to do and I told him I was going to cuff all four of them and he said: 

 "Fuck if you will!" 

 I shot him in the leg - actually it just cut a furrow on the top of his leg – and then told him the next one would be in his chest if he didn't do what I told him. I don't know who voided himself in the back seat when I fired the gun – maybe they all did – but the car started to stink real bad. Andy hurriedly handed the cuffs back to Ben and I told Andy to put a set of cuffs on each wrist and then hook the other ends to the rings welded to the floor in front of him. When Andy was cuffed the way I wanted him I told Ben to cuff his right wrist to the ring on the floor in front of him and then cuff his left wrist to Dan. I told Dan to cuff his left wrist to Rich's right wrist and then I told Rich to cuff his left wrist to the ring on the floor There was some resistance to what I wanted done until I fired a round between Ben and Dan's heads and then it was cry and whine and "I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have" as it began to occur to them what it was all about. 

 I checked to make sure that they were all locked down in the way I wanted and then I started the car and drove out into the country to a place I had already picked out and then I pulled over and parked. They were all babbling shit like "please don't hurt me" and "I'm sorry." I got a "You'll never get away with this" from Andy and I laughed and told him that I didn't expect to get away with it, but I did expect to get even. I told them that the pain they were going to experience was the price of stabbing me in the back. 

 I looked them over for a bit and then said, "I couldn't make up my mind whether to send the car off of the bluff at Steven's Lake so you would sink into sixty feet of water or douse the car with gasoline and set fire to it. I am leaning more toward fire than water because fire will cause you more pain longer. It won't matter much either way because I bought the car out of town using a false name so finding the car on the bottom of the lake or burned up on the side of the road shouldn't lead them back to me, but even if it does I don't care as long as I get even with you bastards. 

 They were all yelling, begging and pleading with me as I poured gas all over the car from the five one gallon cans that I'd had in the trunk. I took a small black box with an antenna on it and set it on the gasoline soaked seat. 

 "This is a remote detonator and you have until I ride the bike I've stashed in the bushes over on the other side of the road into town. I expect that it will take me about half an hour. That will give you enough time to tell each other stories about how much fun you each had with Diane." I laughed and said, "Since you all had such a hot time with my wife I think it is only fitting that I give you a hot time too. Once in own where everyone can see me and give me an alibi if I need one I will place a call to this detonator with this phone" and I showed them the throwaway phone I'd bought at Target. 

 "That call will trigger the spark that will ignite the gasoline that will turn you all into 'crispy critters.' I'm leaving now so you have about half an hour to remember all the good times. You all have fun now, hear?" 

 I smelled the shit as one or maybe all of them let go as I closed the door, crossed the street, got the bike out of the bushes and headed toward town where I would dump the bike and grab a cab back to work. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Once back at work I walked into my boss's office and told Chuck I was quitting and then I told him why. He asked me to stay and told me that he would get rid of the four assholes. He told me that Andy was the only one worth a fuck and that he would transfer him to another office in another state and would fire the other three for poor performance. I told him that if he could make that happen I would be glad to stay. Then he asked me where they were and I told him where I had left them and in what condition. 

 "Right now they are sitting in their own shit and piss and waiting for that little black box to take the call." 

 "Are you really going to make that call?" 

 "I laughed and said, "The box has a wire coming out of it that looks like an antenna, but all the box has in it is a digital wrist watch with the alarm set to go off every four hours. I expect that they will go nuts every time the alarm goes off just knowing that it is the signal that is going to be the end of them. The four of them will be sitting there in their own waste until someone comes along, finds them and does something to set them free. With any luck it will be days." 

 Then I asked for the rest of the week off as vacation and he told me to take off. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was sitting on the couch watching TV when Diane came home. She came in the house, saw me sitting there and since she always got home before I did she asked me if something was wrong. 

 "No. Just decided to come home early." 

 "What are you watching?" 

 "A pornographic documentary." 

 That doesn't sound like something you would do." 

 "Doesn't it? I've been spending a lot of time with porn lately, but watching this is better than reading it." 

 I reached down and picked up the box that was on the floor and set it on the coffee table and said: 

 "Here, you might find them interesting." 

 She walked over and looked in the box about the same time she noticed what was on the screen. 

 "Oh my God no!" she cried. I turned the box over and dumped all of her journals onto the coffee table. She looked like she was going to say something and I said: 

 "Don't bother Diane. No, you can't explain. Yes, it is exactly what it looks like and I do not want to hear the words, "But I love you and it was only sex with them" come out of your lying mouth." 

 She sat down in the chair opposite me and tears were streaking down her cheeks when she asked: 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Nothing." 

 She visibly brightened and said, "Oh thank you baby. I'll make sure that you are never sorry" and she got up and came toward me. 

 "Stay the fuck away from me you lying piece of shit. I said I wasn't going to do anything and high up on the list of things I'm not going to do is touching you or having anything to do with you. We will live in the same house, but it will be as roommates sharing expenses. If I cook I'll make enough for you, but otherwise you are on your own. Just stay the fuck away from me and don't you dare speak to me unless spoken to or it is an emergency. You get to keep the master bedroom because I don't want to sleep on the bed you betrayed me on." 

 I got up and started to leave the room, but stopped and turned to her and said: 

 "One last thing. You ever bring another man into this house and I find out about it I'll take a knife and scar your beautiful lying unfaithful face for life" and then I went upstairs to the spare bedroom I'd moved my things into. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I woke up in the morning I went for my three mile run, came home, showered and dressed for work and then found that Diane had fixed breakfast. I ate it in silence. Diane looked like she wanted to say something, but the look on my face stopped her before she started. She finally got up and dressed for work. I wondered how her day with Donny was going to go. Would she tell him that they were busted or would she take the fact that I'd said I was going to do nothing and just continue on with what she had been doing. Maybe the journal hidden in her travel case would tell me. She wouldn't know that I knew about that one. If I had she would have expected it to be among the ones I'd dumped on the coffee table. 

 After she'd gone I checked the three local TV news channels to see if there was anything on 'the gang of four' but there was nothing. There wasn't anything in the morning papers either and I wondered if they were still there. 

 I spent the day doing what I thought needed to be done. I went to the bank and opened new savings and checking accounts in my name only and then took half of everything out of our joint accounts and moved it to my new ones. I went to safe deposit box and took out the nine certificates of deposit and paid the penalty for cashing them in early and put that money in my new checking account. I called all of our credit card companies, got balances and then arranged for wire transfers to pay them off in full. I changed two of them to my name only and left the other three in mine and Diane's name and then I took half of the CD money left after paying off the cards and put it into our joint checking account. 

 Then, being just a bit curious, I called work and asked the receptionist for Andy and was told he wasn't in that day. I asked for Ben, Dan and Rich and was told they weren't there either. I smiled at that. Hopefully they were still sitting in that old Pontiac waiting for it to go BOOM. I asked for personnel and when I was connected to Debbie I gave her the information she would need to make sure that my paycheck which was on direct deposit got to the new account. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was sitting at the kitchen table when Diane got home. "Not working late?" I sarcastically asked. "Not sticking around after everyone else was gone to give Donny a blow job?" 

 She started to say something, but I held up my hand to indicate she should stay quiet and then I pointed at the chair across from me and told her to sit. I slid a piece of paper across the table to her and told her to look it over and tell me if I'd missed anything. I'd listed all of the monthly household expenses, house payment, utilities, auto insurance, a rough estimate of what we spent on groceries and the like. I was pretty sure that I'd gotten everything. She looked at it, figured out what it was and told me she couldn't see that I'd missed anything. I told her what I'd done that day and that she needed to decide what to do with the three remaining credit cards and contact them. I told her that she needed to set up her own bank accounts and that the money left in the joint account was her half and she needed to move it. 

 "The joint checking account is now the household account and will be used to pay all of the utilities, taxes, house payments, insurance and other household expenses. Starting with your next paycheck you will be responsible for depositing half of the figure on the bottom of the sheet you just read, plus an extra one hundred dollars to cover any emergencies, into the household account." 

 She got a bit of a smile on her face when I told her that I'd broken up the household duties between us. I passed her another sheet of paper where I had listed everything and told her to review it and let me know if she wanted to make any adjustments to it. On it I had listed the parts of the house we would each be responsible for cleaning. She would do the laundry one week and I would do it the next. I would cook one week and she would cook the next. If either of us was not going to be there to cook on our assigned night we needed to give the other party a days notice. 

 She read the list and then told me she would rather do her own laundry and I told her in that case I would do mine and that included sheets and pillow cases so she would have to do hers. I could see that she wanted to say something, but I guess she decided that it was not the time to possibly make matters worse.  

 

 

===

Since I had gotten home early I had prepared dinner so I got up, fixed myself a plate and sat down to eat. Diane said she wasn't hungry and she got up and went up to her room. I cleaned the dishes and then sat down to watch the evening news. Still nothing on the four assholes. I watched the Discovery channel for a while and then went to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The next morning I checked the TV and the paper, but saw nothing on 'the gang of four' so I ate breakfast and then drove out and saw the car still parked where I'd left it. I did a u-turn and went back to town and found a pay phone. Disguising my voice I called the police. I told them that I'd driven by the car for a couple of days and it hadn't moved, but there looked like someone was in it and then I hung up before they could ask me for any more information. In my heart I wanted the bastards to die, but in my head I knew their deaths could send me to jail for the rest of my life. Depending on the story they told I could still go to jail, but maybe for only a couple of years. 

 That evening on the evening news I heard, "In a bizarre situation police found four men handcuffed in a car parked out on Wilcox road. Captain John Marshall, police department spokesman, said the four were rushed to Memorial Hospital. No further information is available at this time, but we will update you as information comes in. So Mike, what are we looking at weather wise?" 

 "Well Marsha, there is a high over.............." 

 The next couple of days would be interesting as I waited to see what would happen. One thing that did happen was that Diane gave me a very concerned look when she got home that night and she stayed well clear of me. 

 I had a date Saturday morning to play golf with my cousin Tom and when I got to his house to pick him up and he opened the door I punched him in the mouth. Before he could shake it off I hit him two more times and when he fell to the floor I kicked him twice in the ribs. Just as I was kicking him his wife walked up and demanded to know what the hell I was doing. I pointed at him lying on the floor and said: 

 "Ask him. I'm pretty sure he has figured it out by now." 

 Then I looked down at him and said, "You were family asshole. Notice I said "were." I don't ever want to lay eyes on you again. Understand me?" 

 He nodded a yes and as I turned to leave Alice was already demanding that Tom tell her what was going on. 

 The rest of the weekend went by with Diane steering well clear of me. 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 Monday when I returned from my morning run Diane told me that my boss had called and wanted me to call him as soon as I got the message. I called and he told me to take a couple of more days off until he could resolve the situation with Andy, Ben, Dan and Rich. That afternoon he called and asked me to come into the office and see him. 

 When I got there he told me that he had fired Ben, Rich and Dan for poor performance and for violating the company policies and procedures manual in that three days of no call and no show were grounds for immediate dismissal. He told them if they left quietly he would give them a 'reasonable' letter of reference, but if they didn't he would make sure that anyone who called for a reference would be told they were totally worthless. The three chose to get the hell out. 

 Andy was a different matter. He was told that his job performance was good enough to justify overlooking the three days of no call no show, but that he would have to take a transfer to either Chicago or Indianapolis. Andy quickly figured out what was going on and said that they had told the police a bullshit story about what happened so that Dan and Rich's wives wouldn't find out the real reason, but if was going to be forced to move he was going to tell the police the real reason. I told him to tell Andy to meet him in conference room C. 

 When Andy walked into the conference room and saw me yelled, "You motherfucker" and rushed at me. He was in a rage and his intent was to tackle me like he had tackled running backs in college and get me on the floor and then work on me. At the last second I moved to the side, grabbed his shirt and used his momentum to run him head first into the wall. While he was dazed and down I kicked him twice – hard – in the nuts and then using a three hole punch I picked up off the conference table I beat on him until my arm got tired. I grabbed a handful of his hair, jerked his head up and got right down in his face. 

 "Listen to me shit face. You take the move because if you stay here this is what you have to look forward to every day we work together from now on. You can call the police if you want to but know this; when I get out and I don't care if it is days, weeks, months or years I will come for you and the next time I will either kill you or cripple you for life and you had best fucking believe that. The only way you can stop me is kill me and then you will be the one to go to jail." 

 I slammed his head down on the floor, stood up and kicked him once more in the nuts and then told him I would back to work at eight the next morning and if I saw him I would come after him. I turned and left the room. I stopped at Chuck's office and told him I would be coming back to work the next morning. 

 Since I was in just the right mood I drove over to where Diane worked to pay Donny a visit. I saw that Diane's car was still in the parking lot even though it was thirty-five minutes after quitting time. The security guard at the front desk recognized me, smiled and told me that Diane was still up in her office. I told him I had stopped by to surprise her and take her to dinner. When I got off the elevator the floor looked empty, but I heard voices coming from the end of the hall where Donny's office was and I headed that way. As I came up to the door I heard Diane talking to Donny and I stopped just to the side of the door and listened in. 

 "I don't care Donny. I keep telling you I don't have to suck your dick anymore. I don't have to let you and your friends fuck me. Henry knows. I don't know how he found out, but he knows so you can't threaten me with telling him anymore so put your dick back in your pants." 

 "It is out and you will suck it before I put it away. You forget that there is still your dear mom and pop, your grandparents, your neighbors and friends. I own you and you had best not ever forget that." 

 I rushed into the office and was on him before he knew what was happening. I punched him in the mouth, pulled him out of his chair and slammed him against the wall and then I wailed on him until he sank to the floor and then I put the boot to him. I kicked him half a dozen times while Diane screamed for me to stop before I killed him. I stepped back and snarled at her: 

 "Oh Heavens Diane. I sure don't want to be responsible for hurting your boyfriend. By all means I'll back off so you can go to him and kiss things to make them better." 

 "Fuck you Henry. The asshole isn't my boyfriend. I just don't want you going to jail." 

 "Fine time to worry about me. You should have done that before you trashed our marriage." 

 I picked Donny up and sat him down in his chair and back handed him a couple of more times and said: 

 "Listen to me shit for brains; listen and pay very close attention to what I say. If any of the shit you have collected on Diane gets to any of her family or friends and I hear about it I will come after you and I will cripple you for life. Imagine yourself in a wheel chair and taking all of your meals through a straw and you will have some idea of the very least that I will do to you. As far as fucking her is concerned that is strictly between the two of you, but if she says no you had better fucking listen to her. You probably don't need to worry about her taking care of your customers since you have turned her into such a whore you won't need to blackmail her into doing it anyway. You had better believe me when I say that all of your blackmail material had better be destroyed because I will not be a happy camper if any of it gets out. Doesn't matter if you do it on purpose or it accidently gets out there; if it shows I will be coming for you." 

 I turned and walked out and went home. Diane got home about twenty minutes later and when she started to say something I got up and left the room. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Wednesday when I got to work I found that Andy had taken a transfer to Chicago. I never did find out what story the four assholes told the police, but they never did come and talk to me. 

 Diane was in her room when I got home from work Wednesday evening and she never came out while I was still up. When I got back from my run the next morning she had breakfast ready and as I sat down to eat she said: 

 "We need to talk Henry." 

 "No we don't Diane. There isn't anything you can say that I want to hear." 

 "Doesn't it matter to you at all that I love you?" 

 "Not the least little bit. In the first place after reading your diaries I don't believe it and secondly, even if it were true, it would mean nothing unless I could return it and my love for you died page by page as I read those fucking books." 

 "Bullcrap Henry! You must feel something for me or you wouldn't done what you did for me the other night." 

 That wasn't for you. That was for me, your parents and grandparents. I needed to relieve some of my rage and that was my main reason for being there. Telling him what I would do to him if he ever released any of his blackmail material was an afterthought. I think too much of your mom and dad to let them find out what a piece of shit you are." 

 "I don't deserve that Henry." 

 "Yes you do Diane, that and more. You keep forgetting that I've read your thoughts. I read where you wrote how turned on you got kissing me after you had sucked another man's cock. I read about how your orgasms were so much better when you fucked me just after giving your cunt to another man. No Diane, no matter what I cal you it will never be strong enough to really describe my feelings toward you." 

 "If you feel all that strongly why are we living in the same house?" 

 "Because I am not going to ruin myself financially just because you decided to become a whore. I have yet to see a divorce where the lawyers didn't get rich, the husband ruined and the wife walk away with everything of value so no way am I going to divorce you." 

 "You are serious? That is your real reason?" 

 "It is." 

 "Well I guess that lets some of the air out of my balloon." 

 "What the fuck does that mean?" 

 "I was hoping you were just trying to keep us close until you could get over your 'mad' and then we could to patch things up." 

 "Why in the hell would you think something like that?" 

 "Because I love you and deep down I know that you love me. You can call me a whore all you want Henry, but I never shorted you. I gave you all the love and affection and sex you could handle. You never heard "Sorry, but I have a headache" or "Not tonight, I'm too tired." Half the time you didn't come after me, it was me coming after you. Okay, so somebody else got to use it, but I was blackmailed into it Henry. I did not want to do it, but there was no way that you could have seen that tape that Donny shot of me and not believe that I was one hundred percent into it and there was no way, absolutely no way, that I could ever let my mom see it. Even if I had been the one to chase after those guys I could not let mom see it." 

 "Jesus Christ Diane; will you get it through your head that I read all of your fucking diaries? Who blackmailed you into telling me that you had a quick overnight trip out of town so you could go out to the airport, pick up a guy in the bar and spend the night with him? Who blackmailed you into spreading yourself on my desk so Rich could fuck you? What was used to get you to fuck Ben, Dan and Andy? What really bad shit that you couldn't bear to have me see got you to call Dan and tell him he could come over if he brought three or four friends with him? Who forced you to call my cousin Tom and ask him if he would like to come over and have some more of you? 

 "You went from being my wife to being everybody's whore so wake up to the fact that you killed your marriage Diane. You and you alone drove the stake through it." 

 She looked at me for maybe ten seconds and then said, "No hope?" 

 "Not a hope in hell." 

 She had tears running down her cheeks when she got up and left the room. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the rest of the week we avoided each other and on Monday I left for my next district visit. When I got home Friday evening the house was dark and Diane's car wasn't in the garage. "Out getting laid" is the thought that crossed my mind. I could see that something was different as soon as I turned on the lights, but it took a second or so before it registered. Some of the furniture was missing. I went upstairs and checked Diane's room and it was empty. I mean totally empty. The bed, the chest of drawers, the bedside tables, the lamps – everything. Her clothes were all gone and all of her 'feminine' products were gone from the attached bathroom. All that was left was the carpet on the floor. 

 When I got to the kitchen I saw an envelope on the kitchen table with Diane's wedding rings on top of it. I opened the envelope and there was a sheet of paper and a business card inside. 

 "Dear Henry, 

 I've accepted that I've lost you and knowing that is killing me. I can't bear living so close to you when we don't even talk to each other, smile at each other or touch. 

 I've found myself an apartment and I've taken just enough to get me moved in. The enclosed business card is my attorney's. Please call him and let him know where you would like to be served. I did not want it done where you work. 

 I know you don't believe it, but I do love you. Take care of yourself, 

 Diane." 

 I hadn't expected that. I'd thought Diane would go along with what I had set up. Why wouldn't she? She had a place to live that would be cheaper than an apartment and a lot more comfortable. The only thing a divorce would give her would be the freedom to remarry and given her whorish ways I wouldn't think she would be interested in doing that. Why marry someone you know you are going to cheat on? No matter I guess. I hadn't wanted a divorce, but it was now out of my hands. On the good side I could now relax at home and not have keep my eyes open to avoid being around Diane. 

 Friday I called her attorney and arranged to pick up the papers at his office during lunch. His secretary gave me the papers and I sat down and read them. They didn't make any sense to me. I asked the secretary if the attorney was in and she said he was so I asked to see if he could give me a few minutes of his time. She showed me into his office and he asked me what he could do for me and I handed him the papers. 

 "Is something missing?" 

 He looked them over and said, "No, it is all there." 

 "She is citing Irreconcilable Differences and God knows there are certainly those, but I don't see anything about division of assets." 

 "That is because that is what she said she wanted. I told her I thought she was crazy, but she was firm about it. All she wanted was to sever the bonds of matrimony and walk away. All you have to do is sign the papers and send them back and wait for the courts to rubber stamp it. In six months you will be single again." 

 "Well I won't sign these the way they are. Do I have to get an attorney and file motions and all that kind of stuff or can you make a simple change to the document?" 

 "What kind of change?" 

 "I have no problem with the Irreconcilable Differences, but she deserves her share of the assets. An even split and if she wants the house she can buy me out. Otherwise I'll sell it and give her half of the proceeds. Do that and I'll sign." 

 "This is most unusual." 

 "In what way?" 

 "The wife in these things usually wants the husband left raped and bleeding. The husband fights like hell to keep the wife from getting even a dime. They fight over who gets the coffee table, the kitchen towels, the dog, the cat and one divorce was stalled while they fought over who would get the sign that hung on their front door that said "Welcome." I'll call her and see if she will agree to let me amend the petition. Is she won't I guess you will have to get an attorney. If you will have a seat in the outer office I'll see what I can do." 

 As I sat there waiting I was asking myself just what the fuck I was doing? She was gone and it wasn't going to cost me a dime so why was I making her take half when I could have had it all? I knew the answer, but I had a hard time admitting it to myself. I loved the stupid cunt. I loved her, but there was no way that I could ever live with her again knowing what I knew. If I had never found that diary in her car we could have lived together with no problem for the rest of our lives. She was right. She had never shorted me. I was happier than a pig in shit until I found that fucking book. I had nine years of bliss with Diane and for that alone she deserved her share of what we had. 

 Ten minutes later I was back in the attorney's office. "She agreed to the change, but will only settle for a seventy/thirty split in your favor and she does not want the house. Please take it. If this gets out I'll become a laughing stock in my profession. Just imagine. Asking the husband of the woman I'm representing to take more money." 

 "How soon can you have the change document?" 

 "I'll have it ready by four-thirty." 

 I told him I would be back to sign it at that time. I went back in at four- thirty and signed the papers and expected that to be the end of it. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I didn't see or talk to Diane over the next six months, but she let me know that she was around. I received a Christmas card with a short message on it. "I love you and I miss you." On Valentine's Day I received a Fed-Ex package from her. It was a heart shaped box of candy with a card that had the same message that had been on the Christmas card. There was a card on my birthday telling me that she loved me and always would. 

 Once Diane had moved out and I had signed the papers I had put the house up for sale and it had moved quicker than I expected. I looked around and found a nice three bedroom condo and moved. On the day the divorce became final I received a card at my new address. It was one of those blank ones that you write your own message in. 

 "I know that this is what you wanted and even though I would have preferred that it never happened I hope that you are happy. I miss you. I love you and I always will. Take care my love." 

 I could not for the life of me understand it. How could she continue to profess her undying love for me when she had done her best to kill mine for her? I know she didn't set out to do it deliberately, she just didn't expect to get caught, but then cheaters never do. And she had cheated. Even if I discounted what she when she was being blackmailed there was still what she did when she wasn't. Well, it was now in the past and I was free to get on with my life. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I started looking around. I wasn't ready to get into another long term relationship, but I did like the company of the opposite sex so I started dating. I was lucky enough to find a woman who wasn't looking for a permanent relationship either, but who was open to a 'friends with benefits' type relationship and Alicia and I started spending a lot of time together. I didn't know how long it would last, but I had liked being married and I knew that some day I was going to start looking for Diane's replacement. 

 But first there was one last act to be played out in the Henry/Diane story. 

 I had just unpacked from my latest district trip and the door bell rang. I went to the door and found Diane standing there.  

 

 

===

"May I come in?" 

 I almost said "no" but then curiosity kicked in so I stepped aside and let her in. She was carrying a box and she walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table. 

 "Could I have a glass of water?" 

 I got her one and sat down at the table across from her. She took a deep breath and then said: 

 "As you know the divorce is final and that chapter of our lives is over, but I still need to talk to you. You may not want to hear it, but I have to say it. It probably won't mean a thing to you, but I need closure." 

 I just sat there and said nothing. 

 "To begin with I did consider coming to you and confessing right after that first time when Donny drugged me. Unfortunately I convinced myself that even if you did forgive me Donny would still send what he had to my parents and God only knew who else so I caved. I hated having to do it and I was disgusted with myself for giving in, but as some comedian used to say at the start of his stand-up routine, "A funny thing happened to me on the way to...." I hated having to do it, I did not look forward to doing it, but the actual sex turned me on something fierce. I had huge orgasms knowing that I was fucking a man I'd never seen before that day and yes, I confess that I got off fucking a man who wasn't my husband. It didn't take me long to become a sex junkie. I hated the walk down the hotel hallway to the room where it would happen, but once it got started I got into it. 

 "The first time Donny and those three men used me I thought "How disgusting!" but the second time I thought that it felt pretty good and the third time I wondered what it would be like with one or two more. The time I did five I was wishing there was a sixth. It got to where the more I got the more I wanted. Then it reached the point where I couldn't wait for the next business trip and I started doing it here in town. I know you will never forgive me for the things I wrote in my journals, but I want you to know that they were never meant to disparage you. I never once considered you a wimp or a cuckold. Yes, it did turn me on making love to you after having been with someone else, but that was a purely sexual feeling and that is where my head was at at the time." 

 "I don't really want or need to know any of this Diane." 

 "Maybe not Henry, but I need you to know it. I need you to know that it was nothing you did that put me where I was at the time. You were in no way lacking in anything that you were doing. I did not go after others because you failed me. I went because I came to crave more than you or any other one man could give me. I would come home to you after spending hours with two or three other guys, make love to you until you couldn't go any more and then fall asleep wishing that there had been some one else in the room to pick up where you left off. 

 "The one thing that I do have to emphasize Henry is what I just said. I made love with you Henry. I fucked the others, but I made love to you. I loved you then Henry; I love you now and I always will love you and I will always be sorry for the way things ended up. It is too bad that you aren't one of those guys who like to share their wives. If you would have been my life would have been perfect. 

 "That is pretty much all that I needed to say. Again, I did not stray because of anything you did Henry. You have to believe that." 

 I sat there and looked at her and tried to think of something to say, but nothing came to mind. After several seconds of silence she took the lid off of the box and then slid the box across the table to me. I looked into it and saw piles of one hundred dollar bills. I looked up at her with confusion written across my face. She read the expression and said: 

 "Donny may have blackmailed me into doing what I did, but he wasn't stupid. He knew that I could scream 'sexual harassment' somewhere down the line and he figured that he could take that away from me if he paid me a commission on the deals I closed or the contracts that I got signed. One percent doesn't sound like much when you say it out loud, but a one percent commission on a three million dollar deal is thirty thousand and I closed a bunch of deals that large and some even larger and I always insisted that Donny pay me those commissions in cash. 

 "I didn't ask for anything in the divorce because when I moved out I had quite a bit tucked away in a safe deposit box. I was shamed when you insisted on splitting our assets evenly. I had several years of commission money that you didn't know about and there you were insisting that I take half of what we had while I sat on what I had. I couldn't bring myself to take half of what we had when I had so much hidden away, but my attorney said you were going to hire an attorney of your own and fight the divorce. If you would have been fighting to stop the divorce I would have welcomed it, but I wasn't going to fight over money so I said I would go for a seventy/thirty split. 

 "Then I started feeling guilty because of what you did. I finally came to accept that I couldn't ever be at peace with myself unless I balanced the scales, but I'm not totally brain dead so I'm giving you the same split only this time I'm taking the seventy percent and you get the thirty." 

 She looked at me for a second or so and then she smiled and said to me: 

 "I know you Henry. I know you are going to look at that box of money and "say no way do I take this. It would be too much like a pimp taking a cut from his whores at the end of the night" but that's not my problem. I've given it to you and I feel better about things now. Keep it or give it to charity it doesn't matter to me because it is yours now. There is a third option. You can give it back to me, but I will only take it back in one way. You kicked me to the curb because I was a whore so the only way you can give it back to me is as a whore. A hundred for straight sex, a hundred for a blow job, one-fifty for anal and five hundred for an all night. If you choose to go that way there is enough money in that box to last for years and years and years." 

 She got up and headed for the front door and when she got there she turned back to me. "I love you Henry so you know what I'd like you to do with the money" and then she was out the door and gone. 

 She was right; I would think of the money as a pimp's cut of the night's proceeds, but out of curiosity I dumped the box out onto the table and counted it out. I put it back in the box and sat there and stared at it for a while. I thought about what it represented. I made good money, but what was in that box was more than three years wages for me – before taxes. 

 It took me all of ten seconds – if that long – to decide what to do with the money. I was going to keep it and if it made me feel like a pimp I'd just have to live with it. Report_Story
