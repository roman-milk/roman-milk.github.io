 ****** The Fat Cow ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© The story started several years ago. After having three kids I was not the slender sexy wife I had been when Jerry married me. I had put on some weight and I admit to having a somewhat 'beaten down look' after spending all day trying to handle three kids all under the age of five. 

 There were times that I was so whipped that I didn't have the energy when Jerry got home and wanted to play. It wasn't his fault and I don't really think that it was mine. It was just life the way life was. There were also times when I wanted some bedroom play and Jerry played the 'too tired' card. Whatever the reason we drew apart and it seemed like Jerry had lost interest in me. 

 One night at a party at his brother's house I overheard Jerry tell his cousin Ralph that he was sorry that he had married "that fat cow." I was hurt. I ran outside and I cried for a good ten minutes before I managed to get myself together and go back in the house. 

 I was a 'fat cow' because I'd had three kids that he had insisted on and he wanted another one. We had three girls and he wanted a son 'to carry on the family name' but after hearing what he'd said to Ralph the asshole was going to have to find another woman because I damned sure wasn't going to carry it for him. 

 Even though our sex life wasn't all that great, maybe once or twice every two weeks or so, I went on birth control pills, was fitted for a diaphragm and laid in a supply of spermicides. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Over the next two years our sex life dropped off to nothing and I started wondering if Jerry might be getting it some place else. 

 One Saturday I was doing the laundry and I picked up a shirt of Jerry's to drop it into the washer and I noticed a smudge on the collar. It was lipstick. I debated on confronting Jerry right away or waiting to see what else I could find. Over the next month I found another shirt with lipstick on it and in a pair of trousers I found the partial remains of a condom wrapper in one of the pockets. The two shirts and the wrapper were in a plastic bag and hidden where Jerry wasn't likely to find them. The day would come when the 'fat cow' would take them out of hiding and shove them up Jerry's ass. 

 By the end of those two years all three kids were in school so I decided to go back to work. Jerry told me he didn't want me going back to work and I basically told him, "Tough shit! I'm going." I called my old employer to see if he had any openings. 

 "I've got one." 

 "Is it something I could do?" 

 "I don't see why not. It is your old job." 

 "I'll be right down to apply." 

 "No need. When you left I anticipated your coming back and your file is noted that you are on a leave of absence. When can you start?" 

 "Monday." 

 If Jerry was pissed that I was going back to work he would be really steamed at my going back to my old job because my old job had me traveling two or three times a month. Sometimes it was only over night and sometimes it could be two or three days. No, Jerry would not be pleased. 

 I called my mom and sister and worked it out so that the kids would be watched until either Jerry or I got home from work and my mom agreed to stay with them if I had to go on a trip. That night over dinner I told Jerry that I was going back to my old company, but I didn't tell him it was back to my old job. Time enough for that when I needed to go on my first trip. Jerry grumbled and then he stomped down into the basement where he stayed until after I'd gone to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 My first week back on the job I played catch up. I met those who had been hired after I left, renewed acquaintances with those I'd worked with before and who were still there and learned all about new products, redesigned products and pricing. 

 One of those hired after I'd left was Hal. I saw the interest in his eyes when we were introduced, but thought nothing of it. Until two days later when he came into the little luncheonette across the street from our office and saw me sitting alone. He asked if he could join me and I of course said yes and after he sat down he said: 

 "I could have done without you coming back to work." 

 "Why in the world would you say something like that?" 

 "Because you are my ideal woman and here you are. But, and it is a very big "but," you are wearing wedding rings." 

 I smiled at him and said, "But, and it is a huge 'but, so are you." 

 "True, but the marriage is pretty much dead. I'm just too cheap to waste the money on an attorney. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to spend all that money just to change an address. We are in separate bedrooms and avoid each other as much as possible so all a divorce would accomplish is cause one of us to move out and get an apartment. Like I said, a lot of money just to get a change of address." 

 "That's interesting, but it skates by an obvious fact." 

 "And that would be?" 

 "Even if I didn't have on wedding rings you still would." 

 "Just what I need. My perfect woman is a nit-picker." 

 "No matter; it is all bullshit anyway." 

 "I beg your pardon?" 

 "I'm thirty pounds overweight. Hardly what you could call a perfect woman." 

 "Not so. Not every man cares for the anorexic runway model type. There are a lot of us who like our women to have some meat on their bones." 

 "Yeah! Right!" 

 "Hey lady; go look at yourself in the mirror. Don't look at yourself below the neck. Concentrate on the neck up. You have a beautiful face and your hairstyle frames it perfectly. And I'm here to tell you that there is absolutely nothing wrong with your legs although four inch heels would make them look even better than they already do." 

 "Yeah! Right!" I said for the second time. "My lunch break is over. See you back at the office." 

 That was the start of it. Hal flirted with me every chance he got and even though I thought he was full of bullshit (don't forget I was still carrying around Jerry's "fat cow") I played along. One day when we were alone in the copy room he said: 

 "One of these days I'm going to make you mine." 

 I laughed and said, "Maybe some day, then again, maybe not." As soon as the words were out of my mouth I was aghast. I'd actually suggested that some day it might happen. And then came the thought that stayed with me for days – had I really meant it? It didn't take long for me to get an answer to that question. Thursday at work I was told that Hal, Mike and I would be flying to Denver the coming Monday for a two day visit to Apollo Aerospace. We would be flying home Wednesday morning. 

 I waited until Friday at dinner to drop the bomb on Jerry. He went into the absolute funk that I knew he would go into and he stormed off to his basement work shop. I cleaned up the dishes, helped the kids with their home work and then we played Monopoly until their bedtime. I took a shower and then climbed into bed. Naked, I turned on the bedside lamp and started reading a book I'd been working on. I was laying there, an open invitation, for Jerry when he came up. He ignored me, undressed, got on his side of the bed and rolled so his back was to me. I got up, put on a robe and went down to the couch to read. 

 Jerry found things to do Saturday that kept him out of the house and Saturday night he ignored me again. Sunday was pretty much the same except Sunday night I told Jerry flat out that I wanted to make love and he looked at me and said, "I don't." For the first time in our marriage the word 'divorce' entered my mind. 

 Monday I got ready for work, fixed the kids their breakfast and packed their lunches. Then I kissed them and sent them off to school. I was on my way out the door with my suitcase when Jerry came into the kitchen and asked me where his breakfast was. Fix it yourself" I said as I walked out the door. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Apparently our reservations had been made last minute and Hal, Mike and I didn't end up sitting with each other. The first time we had to talk was when we deplaned in Denver. Mike had been the most recent to Denver and he talked us into staying at a hotel that he knew had a decent restaurant and a lounge with a live band. We checked in, put our bags in our rooms and then headed out to Apollo. 

 We had lunch with the honchos at Apollo and when the day ended we headed back to the hotel and agreed to meet in the restaurant for dinner at seven. After dinner we went to the lounge and had a few drinks and I took turns dancing with Mike and Hal until Mike said he was going to turn in early and headed off to his room. 

 Another hour of drinking and dancing put me in one hell of a good mood. The mood was helped along by Hal's hard on poking into my leg when we danced to slow numbers. It seemed that he really meant it when he said I turned him on. 

 It was almost ten-thirty when Hal said, "You know I want you, right?" 

 I'd had just enough to drink and was still pissed at Jerry for his attitude toward me that I lifted my face, kissed Hal and said: 

 "Then why are we here wasting valuable time?" 

 "Your room or mine?" 

 "Mine. I need to put my diaphragm in. Do you have any condoms?" 

 "No need to on my account. I've had a vasectomy." 

 "Maybe, but who else have you slept with lately?" 

 "The last one was my wife nine months ago." 

 "No offense, but I don't know you all that well yet so until you can show me something from a doctor or a clinic and I find out what to look for to make sure that you are telling the truth about the vasectomy it is diaphragms and condoms." 

 "I'll have to get some. Meet you in your room in fifteen?" 

 "I'll be ready." 

 And I was. 

 When the knock came and I checked through the peep hole that it was Hal I opened the door and stood there in front of him in only nylons, garter belt and high heels. 

 "My God!" he exclaimed, "I told you that you were my ideal woman." 

 He took me in his arms and gave me a passionate kiss which I returned before leading him to my bed and helping him undress. He told me that he wanted to eat my pussy and I told him no, that it wouldn't be fair unless I sucked his cock and I wouldn't do that until I knew he was STD free. 

 "I don't care. You can owe me one and pay me back later, but right now I have to feast on my sexy goddess." 

 Hal ate my pussy and he was very good at it. Jerry would eat me from time to time, but only halfheartedly because he didn't like doing it. The only reason he did it at all was because if he didn't use his mouth on me I wouldn't use mine on him. 

 Hal had a nice body and was in pretty good shape. His cock was about the same size as Jerry's, but the cockhead looked a little bigger. Jerry's cock was straight and the length terminated in a cockhead the same circumference as the cock, but Hal's cockhead looked like a plum on the end of his cock and I looked forward to having it in my mouth. 

 I was amazed at how easy it was for me to be intimate with another man. Hal ate me to an orgasm and then mounted me and fucked me to another one. When he softened I held him to me and kissed him with plenty of tongue until I felt him start to stiffen in me and then I laid back and let him fuck me to another climax. I wrapped my legs around him, clutched his ass with my hands and fucked back up at him until he came. Still holding him in me we cuddled while we both rested. 

 After a while I loosened my grip and he got up. When he reached for his pants I asked him where he was going and he told me he was going to his room so I could get some sleep. 

 "Oh no you don't. You will wake up in this bed, understand?" 

 "If I stay here I won't wake up in this bed because if I stay I doubt that we will ever fall asleep." 

 He was all most right. It was two in the morning before we could go any farther. I woke first and really wanted to wake him with a blow job, but I passed until I could see that he was okay medically. I did fondle him until he was awake and hard and then I did him cowgirl before sending him off to his room. 

 As I was showering I was thinking, "Fat cow huh? Well fuck you Jerry!!!" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I admit to feeling a little guilty as I made it through the day. Luckily Hal was in a different part of the building because I'm not sure of how I would have been had he been close by. 

 I took my lunch with three girls I had worked with on previous visits to Apollo before leaving my company to become a housewife and mother. Two of them wanted to know about Hal and Mike. 

 "They are hot Steph. Which one are you playing with?" 

 "Me? Oh no ladies. This girl is a married woman and a mother of three." 

 "So am I Stephanie, but it wouldn't keep me from playing if I could go on a business trip with a pair like that. Hell! I'd probably even do them both." 

 "Get serious Wanda." 

 "I am Steph; I most definitely am." 

 And she must have been because she met Mike in the lounge that evening and it wasn't long before the two of them headed for Mike's room. As they walked away Hal said: 

 "That give you any ideas or would you rather drink and dance." 

 The guilt I had carried around all day disappeared as I stood up and said; 

 "Let's go." 

 I had my hand inside his pants ten seconds after the elevator door closed and then the rest of the night was a repeat of the previous night. I don't know why, but I didn't feel any guilt the next day. Not even a smidgen! 

 We spent half a day at Apollo and then headed for the airport to catch a flight home. Hal and I sat together on the flight and he asked if we were going to be able to get together when we were at home and after giving it some serious thought I said no. As we put up the tray tables and seatbacks for landing I told Hal that I didn't think it would be a good idea. Too much chance of getting caught and I didn't want that, but if we were ever on another trip together I'd be willing for a repeat. 

 Things were on the cool side around the house after I got home. Jerry went out of his way to ignore me and I returned the favor. By Friday I was regretting telling Hal that I wouldn't play unless we were on trips, but not enough to back off. The chances of getting caught were too great and while I was rapidly reaching the point where I wouldn't mind seeing the backside of Jerry I didn't want to put my kids through a divorce. Jerry was proving to be a piss poor husband, but he was a great father and he loved the kids as much as they loved him. Since all we were doing was co-existing in the house anyway and it wasn't causing any nasty scenes I figured that we could just continue on. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two weeks went by and then I was off on another trip. This one a two day and one nighter to San Diego. The team this time was made up Mike, Hal, me and Gloria from accounting. Gloria and I were sitting together. Gloria had been with the company when I worked there the first time and we were pretty friendly with each other. In fact, we had double date several times back before I met Jerry. Gloria was a tad wild back then and on one of our double dates she had fucked her guy on the back seat while I was busy fighting of my date on the front. We were almost to San Diego when she said: 

 "Which one do you want?" 

 "Which one do I want? What are you talking about?" 

 "Hal or Mike? Which one do you want?" 

 I looked at her and she said, "Don't look at me like that sweetie. You know how much I like sex." 

 "But you are married now. What about your husband?" 

 "He's at home. I'm not. I'm going to fuck one or the other on this trip and maybe even both if you don't want one." 

 "Still the same slut that I came to know and love?" 

 "Yep! That's me. When I'm home no one touches me except for hubby, but when I'm away from home all holes are open for business." 

 "In that case I'll take Hal." 

 "Bitch! He's the one I really wanted." 

 "Too bad. I told him last time I would only do him on trips and he has been looking forward to this trip for weeks." 

 "But you are married now. What about your husband?" 

 "He's at home" I said, "And I'm not" and we both laughed. 

 Before we boarded the flight Hal handed me a slip of paper and when I read it I saw it was from a clinic and it stated that he was disease and drug free. I smiled at him and said: 

 "I guess this means that we can do whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt or leave marks on me." 

 "I'm going to hold you to that." 

 When we got to the hotel and got our rooms I told Hal to put his bags in mine since I didn't expect that he would ever see the inside of his. 

 "Why didn't you tell me that before I wasted money on a room?" 

 "Because I don't want anyone back home to know what we are doing. If you didn't have a room on your expense report it would raise a red flag and invite questions I'd just as soon not be asked." 

 When we were in my room Hal asked me if we had time for a 'quickie' and I told him no, but we did have time for me to pay him back. 

 "Pay me back?" 

 I smiled and went to my knees in front of him. "You did me last time so I owe you one" I said as I unzipped him. I pushed him back on the bed and knelt between his legs and took him in my mouth. I gave him the best blow job I was capable of and when he came I swallowed all of his discharge. I think he liked it. I licked my lips clean and said: 

 "We'd better hurry. The others are waiting for us in the lobby." 

 The rest of the day was spent taking care of business at Excel Products and at four-thirty we returned to the hotel. We made plans to meet in the restaurant for dinner and went to our rooms. As soon as Hal and I were through the door to my room we both started shedding clothes and as soon as I was nude I got on the bed and Hal was there seconds later. I pulled him on top of me, took hold of his cock, rubbed it up and down against my pussy lips and then guided him into me. 

 We made love twice and then showered and went down to join the others for dinner. After dinner Hal suggested we have a few drinks in the lounge and Gloria laughed and said: 

 "I don't need to waste time on seduction. Come on Mike" and she took his hand and they got up and left. 

 Hal looked at me and I shrugged and said, "When she's right, she's right." 

 We didn't make a big deal out of getting undressed when we got to the room I just got naked and got on the bed and Hal joined me. We enjoyed our first sixty-nine together and then I swung around and mounted him cowgirl until he rolled me over and slammed it into me. He pounded me through two orgasms and when I felt the splash of his discharge it triggered my third climax. 

 As soon as I had my body under control I slid down and took his cock in my mouth. When I got him up I got on my hands and knees and he took me from behind. I love it from behind and I don't know which of us worked the hardest – him fucking me or me shoving back at him. 

 We both got off and then snuggled up until it was time for me to call home. I made Hal go sit in a chair while I talked to the kids and when I was done with them I asked if their father wanted to talk to me and after a couple of seconds Jerry came on the line. 

 "Just checking to see if things are okay." 

 "If you really cared about things here being okay you would be here making sure that they were." 

 "Not going there Jerry!" I said and I hung up. 

 After I put the phone down Hal said, "Earlier you said I could do whatever I wanted so long as it didn't hurt. Does that include anal?" 

 I had loved anal before I met Jerry, but Jerry thought that it was disgusting. He tried it once and when we were done he pulled his cock out, saw some shit on it and ran into the bathroom and tossed his cookies. I hadn't had anal since then. 

 "Promise to take it slow and easy until I get used to it?" 

 "Whatever you want is what you'll get." 

 We had to use some of my hand lotion for lube, but it got the job done. 

 We showered together and once his cock was clean I tried to suck him hard again, but given the BJ when we first arrived and the three times before the shower he was done. We fell asleep snuggled up with each other. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** The Fat Cow ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© He was able in the morning and we got it done before meeting Mike and Gloria for breakfast. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Gloria and I sat together on the flight home and she told me that we needed to spend more time together now that I was back to work. 

 "Oh yeah, just what I need. You would be trying to line me up so I could be on my back on the bed next to you." 

 "Would that be so bad?" 

 "Yes it would. I have almost no chance of being caught if I limit myself to out of town trips. Screwing around at home is like begging to be caught." 

 "Oh no girlfriend. I already told you that no one but hubby touches me when I'm not on a trip. I just think we need a girl's night out once in a while. A few drinks, dance with a couple of guys, tease them a little and then leave them with a case of blue balls." 

 "Why would you do that?" 

 "Because they would be assholes. They would see the rings, but would try to hook up with us anyway. It doesn't bother me to burn assholes. Besides, doing it makes me horny and I go home and practically rape my old man." 

 "Which is why I couldn't do it." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because it would send me home horny." 

 "So?" 

 "So I wouldn't be able to do anything about it" and I told her the sad story of my relationship with Jerry. 

 "He said that? He actually called you a fat cow?" 

 "He did." 

 "Well fuck him then! Get rid of him." 

 "No can do. I can't do that to the kids. I'll suffer with Jerry and let Hal take care of the rest when we travel." 

 "That's no good. You could go weeks without getting laid. I don't know about you, but I can't go three days without getting laid, let alone weeks. We have to figure something out for you." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Things were a little on the cold side between me and Jerry when I got home. I'd known they would be, but then again before my going back to work they hadn't been any better. 

 I was doing the laundry on Saturday and as I was separating the whites from the coloreds I found a pair of Jerry's briefs with lipstick on the front next to the opening. I stood there staring at them when the light bulb went on over my head came on. Jerry wasn't stupid and Jerry wasn't careless. The shirts with the traces of lipstick, the remains of the condom wrapper and now lipstick stained underwear? I could see maybe one shirt being accidentally overlooked, but the rest of it? 

 I was meant to find them! I was being set up! 

 I was supposed to find them and go storming after Jerry and confront him. Faint traces of lipstick on shirts didn't do the trick so let's try a condom wrapper. Shit! That didn't get the job done so let's make it a little more blatant with lipstick on my underwear. Oh no Jerry. Oh no. I put the briefs in the plastic bag with the rest I was saving and wondered what would come next. A full tied off condom where I couldn't miss it? No way Jerry! No fucking way! 

 I've no idea why Jerry wanted me to confront him, but it wasn't going to happen. Whatever game he was playing he was playing alone because he wasn't going to get a confrontation from me. If he wanted to force the issue then he would have to do it because I was going to be wearing blinders as far as he was concerned. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was two weeks before my next trip; a three day, two nighter to Boston. Hal wasn't on the trip this time. It was just me and Mike. We went right to Wayman Technologies from the airport and didn't get to the hotel until six. We arranged to meet in the hotel restaurant at seven and as I unpacked and freshened up I wondered if Mike would make a pass at me before the night was over. And then I wondered if I would be receptive if he did. 

 We ate dinner and after we were finished Mike asked me if I wanted to have a drink or two in the lounge and that led to a dance or two and during a slow number he 'accidently' touched my leg with his erection and I pretended that I didn't notice. After a couple of more drinks Mike asked: 

 "You and Hal have a thing going or do you just like to play when you are away from home?" 

 I had expected the question or one like it and I'd had all day to think about it, but still hadn't made up my mind so I said: 

 "Hal and I don't have a thing going, but as far as just wanting to play when I'm away from hubby I don't know. Hal is the first since I got married." 

 "Maybe you need to try someone else." 

 "Maybe I don't want to get a reputation." 

 "Hey sweetie; what goes on out of town stays out of town." 

 "What about my out of town reputation?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I'm not dumb Mike. I know what you are asking. What if I say yes? What happens the next time you, me and Hal are on a trip? You going to arm wrestle for me. Or do 'rock, paper, scissors' while I stand there and watch? What about my working relationship with Hal back home when he finds out?" 

 "Hal is cool with it." 

 "Oh?" 

 "When he hooked up with you I told him how much I envied him. He said I should be patient; that some day I might get a chance. When I found out that we would be alone on this trip I asked him if I would be upsetting any apple carts if I tried with you and he wished me luck. Told me that if I could make it happen I'd be in for the time of my life." 

 I'm sure that I had a nasty look on my face when I said: 

 "Oh he did, did he?" 

 "Don't go having bad thoughts. He also told me he would marry you in a heartbeat if you would leave your husband, but he knows you never will because of your kids. In fact, he told me that he hoped I would get to spend the night with you because it would help lessen the emotions he was feeling where you were concerned." 

 "He said that?" 

 "Scout's honor." 

 That is what made up my mind for me. Emotional entanglements were the last things I needed and as much as I liked Hal I didn't need him stuck on me. Maybe if Jerry got run over by a bus so separating him from the kids wouldn't be a problem and Hal and I could work things out, but not until. 

 "What the hell" I said to myself as I stood up and dropped the key to my room on the table in front of Mike. 

 Mike was every bit as good in bed as Hal and he had something that I couldn't get enough of. He had a skinny dick! I was maybe seven and a half inches long, but it wasn't very big around. It was perfect for anal sex and fortunately for me Mike liked anal as much as I did. He did me once in my pussy, but three times in my ass. He had the cleanest cock in town by the time we were done because I kept having to wash it and get it clean so I could suck him hard again. 

 We made it again in the morning just after the front desk gave us our wake up call. The next night was a repeat and on the flight home Mike said: 

 "If you would like I'll tell Hal I struck out." 

 "No. Let him know. It will be much easier for all concerned if the three of us go on a trip together and he knows." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got home Jerry was his usual sour self toward me, but the kids were happy to see me. The next day I talked to my mom and she told me that both nights Jerry stayed out late and didn't get home till after eleven. Out with 'lipstick girl' was my thought. I had to smile at that. He thought he was putting something over on me. I might have been a 'fat cow' to him, but he was a stupid asshole to me. 

 When I did the laundry that weekend I found another pair of briefs with lipstick on them and I also found a shirt that had a couple of blond hairs that had 'somehow' gotten wrapped around a button. "Keep trying Jerry" I thought, "Just keep trying." I put the underpants and the shirt in the bag with the rest of his planted items. 

 I made a decision that weekend. While Jerry was off doing something or other I moved Becky into Alice's room and then I moved all of my things into Becky's old room. Becky and Alice both whined, Becky because she had to give up her room and Alice because she now had to share hers. I shut them up by promising to increase their weekly allowances and then of course Cindy whined that it wasn't fair that they got an increase and she didn't so I had to give her one also. 

 Jerry didn't notice the changes in the bedroom when he went to bed. 

 I was in the kitchen was in the kitchen fixing breakfast when he got up in the morning. He got a cup of coffee out of the pot and sat down at the table. 

 "I got up in the middle of the night to pee. You weren't in bed." 

 "I was in bed." 

 "No you weren't. Your side of the bed hadn't even been turned down." 

 "I was asleep in my bed." 

 "Your bed?" 

 "I moved into Becky's room." 

 "Why the hell did you do that?" 

 "You haven't had anything to do with me for months so I just decided that since you didn't seem to want me around I'd move and get out of your way." 

 He just shrugged, got up and refilled his coffee cup and went out into the living room to watch the morning news on the TV.

 Tuesday Gloria asked me to stop for a drink after work. We drank margaritas and talked about work and the people there and then she said: 

 "I hear I might be going on a trip with you next week." 

 "I knew I was going, but I haven't heard who with." 

 "What I hear is that it will be you, me, Hal and Mike." 

 "Could be. Either Hal, Mike or both are usually with me." 

 "If it is true can I have Hal this time?" 

 "That isn't up to me honey; you need to work that out with Hal, but I think I can safely say that he won't be averse to it." 

 "Just checking. I thought you might have something going on and I didn't want to intrude." 

 "Nothing except that he has been an out of town bed buddy." 

 "You won't lose anything on the deal. Mike is pretty damned good in bed." 

 "I know." 

 She looked at me with surprise on her face and said "You slut you!" 

 I just shrugged and smiled. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The trip was a three day and two night visit to Baltimore and Gloria had no trouble in getting Hal to give her a try. The first night Hal spent with Gloria and I played with Mike and the second night I got Hal and Gloria had Mike. 

 Hal was softly snoring and I was leaning on an elbow looking at him as thoughts danced through my mind. I wondered why I could turn on men like Hal and Mike – turn them on so much that they couldn't leave me alone when we got naked. They acted like they couldn't wait to get me naked and they kept trying to get me to play with them when we were home from the trips. Why did my own husband, the man who had pursued me and practically begged me to marry him, find me so repulsive? 

 It wasn't just Hal and Mike either. Since I had gone back to work there had been a lot of men checking me out and coming on to me and yet to my own husband I was a fat cow. I began to wonder if I shouldn't just leave Jerry. I might suffer some guilt at taking his children away from him, but he would have visitation rights. I wouldn't try to keep him away from them. 

 Did I really want to wait the twelve years before the youngest was ready to move out before getting a life for myself? I fell asleep with those thoughts still bouncing around and those thoughts were never very far away over the next days and weeks.

 It was three weeks before my next trip. A one day, one night jaunt to Detroit. There were three of us – Hal, Mike and me. We spent the day at Excelsior and then met for dinner in the hotel restaurant at seven. The lounge was next and I danced a couple of numbers with each of them and even though we seemed to be enjoying ourselves things seemed a little strained. It took three drinks before I figured out why. 

 The two boys were trying to figure out how to bring up the night's sleeping arrangements. 

 I should have been a little pissed that they had just assumed I'd be going to bed with one of them, but I wasn't. The 'fat cow' was feeling pretty damned good knowing that two healthy good looking males wanted her. Then I had a wicked thought. I was a bit of a wild child before I'd met and married Jerry. I'd done a threesome or three and I'd even once pulled a train at a frat house kegger, but I had put all that behind me when I had said "I do." It had been a long time ago and I'd not thought of it in years. I looked at them seated across the table from me and said: 

 "Both." 

 "Both?" they asked almost in unison. "What do you mean "both?" 

 "You are both walking on eggshells trying to figure out how to bring up what will be happening when we leave here. I've just made the decision for you. Both." 

 "You're kidding, right?" Hal asked. 

 "Not in the least" I said as I stood up. "We have a long night ahead of us so we'd best get started." 

 It was an exhausting night. Their cocks were very busy. Two holes had cocks in them at all times. Ass and mouth; pussy and mouth and pussy and ass until they couldn't get it up anymore 

 The evening had not only been memorable, but it had helped me make a decision. I decided that I wasn't going to wait twelve years to get on with my life. On the flight home I decided to put an end to the farce that was my marriage to Jerry. I'd give him as much visitation with the kids as he wanted, but I was no longer going to stay tied to someone who didn't want me just for the sake of his relationship with his kids. 

 After checking the laundry on Saturday for any more of his 'accidental' overlooks I'd give him the confrontation he was apparently looking for. 

 I didn't have to wait for Saturday. 

 Friday evening as I was doing the dinner dishes Jerry said, "I'm short a couple of shirts and some underwear. I've looked in the laundry room and they aren't there." 

 I dropped the pan I was scrubbing into the sink and left the kitchen. I was back in a minute with the plastic bag that had all of the lipstick stained clothing in it and I tossed the bag to him. 

 "I was saving it up until I had a full load for you to take to your bimbo so she could launder them for you." 

 I went back to the sink and back to scrubbing the pot. With my back to him I said: 

 "What's the matter Jerry? Cat got your tongue?" 

 There was a minute of silence and then Jerry gave me the biggest line of bullshit I'd ever heard. 

 "There isn't any bimbo. I sensed you pulling away from me so I faked those things hoping that they would make you fight for me." 

 "Me fight for you? That's a laugh Jerry. Why would I fight for an asshole who tells his cousin that he is sorry, and these were your exact words Jerry, "That I married that fat cow!" The only reason that I haven't already divorced you is that I didn't want to separate you from the kids, but that has changed. I've decided that I'm not going to put my life on hold until the youngest turns eighteen. I'll be seeing an attorney as soon as I can make an appointment." 

 "I don't want a divorce." 

 "Tough shit Jerry because I do and I'm going for one." 

 "I won't let you take my kids away from me. I'll fight a divorce." 

 "Fight it all you want. All you can do is waste money on a lawyer to slow it down or stall it, but you can't stop it. I am not staying with you just so you can have the kids around. You can have all the visitation you want. Besides; I need to be gone so you can find another woman to give you the son you want to carry on the family name because I sure as hell won't be doing it." 

 I finished the dishes and then went to help the kids with their homework. After putting them to bed I took a shower and when I came out I found Jerry sitting on the bed waiting. 

 "We need to talk." 

 "No we don't. I don't need to hear anymore of your bullshit. You not having a bimbo might or might not be true, but this 'fight for me' bullshit is just that – bullshit! If that is what you wanted you would have been doing your damndest to make it happen, but you have totally ignored me for the last two years and I'm finally done with it." 

 I walked to my bedroom and closed the door on him. Jerry kept trying to get me to talk with him over the weekend and I refused to discuss anything with him. Finally, after dinner on Sunday he said: 

 "Okay, don't talk with me, but understand this; I will fight a divorce tooth and nail." 

 "It would be in your best interest not to. If you accept it and sign the papers with no trouble I won't ask for alimony and I'll agree to maximum visitation where the children are concerned and I'll agree to a fifty/fifty split of the assets. You fight me on it and I'll go for alimony, as much child support as I can get and use of the family home until the last child turns eighteen. You want to make house payments for the next twelve years while you also have to pay to live in an apartment somewhere? 

 "I'll get custody Jerry; any good lawyer will tell you that. The courts always give custody to the mother unless there are some really nasty circumstances and I'll tell you this right up front. You fight this divorce and no matter what visitation the courts give you it will amaze you to find out how many things I can do to see that you don't get to see them. I don't want to use them as a club Jerry; but use them I will if you fight me on this. 

 "If you fight it you will have to get an attorney and they aren't cheap. You will be paying him and all he will be able to do is stall things. Once I file, unless I withdraw the filing, the divorce will happen. Sooner or later it will happen. I don't want you Jerry. I haven't wanted you since you told Ralph I was a fat cow. Accept it Jerry; it will happen." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As I was leaving the house to go to work on Monday I noticed the soiled shirts and underwear on the floor of the laundry room and I decided to hang onto them and maybe use them if jerry did fight the divorce. That afternoon I made an appointment with an attorney for Tuesday afternoon. When we talked I told him that all I wanted was custody of the children, an even distribution of assets, reasonable child support with Jerry getting ample visitation. 

 I gave him the bag of Jerry's dirty laundry to possibly use if Jerry did decide to fight. I told him that if Jerry fought the divorce I wanted the attorney to pursue a scorched earth policy. He told me he could have the papers filed by Thursday and Jerry served on Friday and I told him to do it. 

 Wednesday I told Hal and Mike I had filed for divorce and that there would be no more playing on trips until the divorce was final. 

 "If Jerry fights the divorce he might just decide to hire someone to see if he can catch me doing something he can use against me. Even if he doesn't fight it I need to be careful." 

 Hal asked me to have lunch with him and since Jerry hadn't been served yet I said okay. Over lunch Hal said: 

 "What are my chances once you are single again?" 

 "As good as anyone else's." 

 "Can't you give me any more encouragement than that? If I have a better than even shot I'll file on my wife and with luck we will end up free around the same time." 

 "I can't give you any encouragement because I have no idea what I want to do. I just might want to stay single for a while. And then of course there is Mike." 

 "Mike?" 

 "Yes, Mike. He has also expressed an interest." 

 "No fair. I got to you first." 

 "What has fair got to do with it? We dance well together and we are pretty good in bed together, but other than that I don't know all that much about you and you don't know much about me. You don't know my likes, dislikes or anything. All you know is that we have fun once or twice a month while on business trips. I need to know a hell of a lot more than that about someone before I get serious about them. And back to Mike. Do you have any idea how much I enjoyed what happened on our last trip. Why would I want to get married again and have to give that up?" 

 "Maybe you wouldn't have to." 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "I'm a fairly open minded guy. I like what we did on our last trip too." 

 "Just how open minded are you? Bear in mind I have no intention of giving up my job and you already know that you don't always go on all my trips with me. Could you handle seeing me go off for two or three days with Mike or someone else from the department knowing full well what would likely happen? How about once I'm divorced and I don't have to limit myself to out of town trips? What if neither of you went with me and I wanted to pick up some guy in the hotel lounge?" Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** The Fat Cow ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "That I wouldn't care for. I know Mike and I trust him, but a lounge pick up? I'd probably want you to be tested when you got back home." 

 "But you wouldn't object?" 

 "Would you if I went on a trip without you and Gloria was along?" 

 I looked at my watch and then said, "Lunch is over. All I can tell you Hal is that I need to know you a lot better before I can tell you that you have an honest shot." 

 "So when can we start dating so you can learn about me?" 

 "Don't know. Haven't even served Jerry with the papers yet." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Mike solved our "Jerry might be watching" problem the next time we were out of town. On the assumption that anyone watching would be watching me he got us rooms with a connecting door. We had dinner and then moved to the lounge for a couple of drinks and then Mike took off and went to his room. 

 I hung around the lounge for a half hour and let a couple of guys buy me drinks and dance with me. Then I left and went up to my room. Five minutes later Mike came through the connecting door and never went back through it until it was time for breakfast in the morning. I left my room and went down to the hotel restaurant and that should have drawn off whoever was watching me and twenty minutes later Mike came down and joined me. 

 The next trip had me, Gloria, Hal and Mike visiting Amalgamated in Salt Lake and Mike arranged for rooms with connecting doors for me and Gloria and regular rooms for him and Hal. After dinner Gloria, Mike and Hal left and went up to the rooms and I did my stick around the lounge bit for half an hour and then went up to my room. 

 As I rode up in the elevator I wondered who would have come through the connecting door and be waiting for me. It was Mike. Not that it mattered because he and Hal went back and forth through the door for most of the night. Gloria and I both had large smiles in the morning. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Jerry didn't fight the divorce and after the divorce was final Hal put on a full court press to get me to marry him. He must think he has a good chance because he moved out and filed for divorce and his wife didn't contest it. His divorce will be final in a month. 

 There is a pretty good chance that I will hook up with him, but it won't be anytime soon. The 'wild child' that I'd been before marrying Jerry was back and she was enjoying herself. I'm having too much fun to settle back down right away. 

 Besides Hal and Mike there is a new hard cock in my life right now. Jack was hired four months ago and the company gave him to me to train. Jack is at least ten years younger that I am and for some strange reason he has the hots for me. 

 I took Jack on his first trip and besides the two of us Gloria and Mike went along. The first night after the usual dinner, drinks and dancing Gloria and Mike got up and hand in hand walked to the elevator. Jack watched them go with a wistful look on his face and I asked: 

 "Is it Gloria or what they are going to be doing?" 

 "What?" 

 "The look on your face. Is it because of Gloria or because what the two of them will be doing in about ten minutes?" 

 He blushed and said, "I guess what they are going to be doing." 

 "Why?" 

 "It has been a long time for me and I guess I'm jealous of Mike." 

 I laughed and said, "Your dry spell is over honey" and I stood up, offered him my hand and said, "Come on lover, let's go." 

 The stunned, confused look on his face almost made me laugh, but he quickly realized what I'd just said and what it meant and he stood up so fast that his chair fell over. 

 You just have to love the rejuvenating powers of youth. For the first time I was the one who had to call it quits. 

 I came out of my room in the morning just as Gloria came out of hers. She grinned at me and said: 

 "You are such a slut." 

 "Now what did I do?" 

 "Not what you did – who you did. I can't believe it. You – robbing the cradle." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "I came out of Mike's room the same time Jack came out of yours. Can I have him tonight?" 

 "Now who is being the slut?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 And Jerry? Jerry and the bimbo he didn't have? 

 One week after our divorce was final he married a young blonde who was obviously pregnant and whose hair color was a match for the hairs I'd found on his shirt. She had the baby six months after they were married and it was a girl. Poor Jerry will have to try again for the son he wants. I wonder what she will look like after her third or fourth kid and whether Jerry's Cousin Ralph will hear about: 

 "Another fat cow I wish I'd never married." Report_Story
