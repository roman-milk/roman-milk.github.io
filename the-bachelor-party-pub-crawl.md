 ****** The Bachelor Party Pub Crawl ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I don't know if I will ever forget that night. I know that on the one hand I hope to God I never do, while on the other I know it might be best if I did. It was the most sexually exciting event of my life and one I would dearly love to happen again. But at the same time it showed me how easy it was to cross a line and I'm not sure that I want to go through the rest of my life knowing that. 

 +++++ 

 It started when Monte went to a knee in front of Daphne and proposed. Five months later it was time for the bachelor party. Harry, Monte's best friend and Best Man designate, started to put the party together. First there was the list of who to invite. The final list had fourteen names on it. Next he had to find a place big enough to accommodate fourteen cigar chomping, beer drinking, card- playing guys and still have enough room left over where the obligatory stripper could perform. Some negotiating, mostly with Dave's wife, secured Dave's house for the event. Dave's wife graciously (never did find out what Harry offered her) offered to spend the night over at her sister's. 

 Next Harry huddled with Monte over what he would like in the way of a stripper. Daphne was a drop dead gorgeous five foot nine raven haired beauty with legs that went on forever, but her tits, while perfectly fine for her body size, were not really all that large. That fact alone made some of us wonder how Monte and Daphne ended up together since Monte was an out and out tit man -the bigger the better! He had often been heard to say that if they didn't have tits big enough to serve as pillows they weren't worth having around. So Harry came out of the huddle with his marching orders; find a stripper with humongous tits because once married big tits would be a thing of the past for Monte. Harry hit four different agencies before he found what he wanted. Blonde, five foot two and with 42DD tits. 

 Everything was set, Harry had all his ducks lined up in a row and everyone was looking forward to the party. And then Daphne threw shit into the game. There would be NO, repeat, NO strippers at the party. 

 "I've heard plenty about what strippers do at bachelor parties" she told Harry, "and I will not allow that to happen to Monte. If he comes to me after some slut has stripped for him, given him a lap dance and a blow job the wedding is off!" 

 The word slowly filtered through the rest of us and the outcome was predictable. "What!? No stripper? You can't have a bachelor party without a stripper." 

 There was a lot of grumbling and one or two of the guys even talked about trying to talk Monte out of marrying a 'puritanical bitch' like Daphne. It was Jerry who came up with the idea. 

 "Is it the stripper she objects to, or is it the thought that the stripper might give Monte a blow job and maybe even a last fuck with a big-titted woman?" 

 The consensus was that it was the possible sex that Daphne was against. "So," Jerry said, "How about instead of the stripper coming to us, we go to the stripper?" 

 "What the hell are you talking about?" asked Harry. 

 "We have two weeks before the party. Make a list of all the strip bars in town, split the list up among the guys and then everyone go to the places on their lists and check them out. Find the bars that have the girls with the biggest tits and on the night of the party we will go on a pub crawl and hit all the bars that have girls with big tits. Instead of one lap dance we can get Monte a half dozen and it will all be out in public so no sex will happen. Daphne can't be upset with that." 

 We all thought that would be a great idea and then Harv threw ice water on it. "Three or four cars running all over town from bar to bar? I don't know guys. The odds are pretty good that one of us will get stopped for driving under the influence." 

 That put a damper on things, but once again it was Jerry to the rescue. "We won't go in separate cars. We will hire a limo." 

 "No way man," Harv said, "You can't get fourteen guys in a limo." 

 "So we find a limo service with one of those mini-busses." 

 Harry said he would look into it and two days later Monte's Bachelor Party Pub Crawl was on. 

 +++++ 

 We all met at Dave's place because he had enough room for all of us to park. At six the big, white mini-bus pulled up out front and the driver got out and opened the doors for us. I can't speak for the rest of the guys, but as for me, she took my breath away. That's right - she. We had been under the impression that the driver was going to be the man who owned the company and what we got was a beautiful blond who stood almost six foot tall in her high heeled pumps. 

 Besides the pumps, her uniform differed from a male chauffeur's uniform in that she was wearing a skirt instead of trousers. The skirt wasn't a mini, but it still showed an ample amount of extremely shapely leg. Being a leg man and having high heels as one of my biggest turn ons I was quick to seize the day. 

 While she was busy telling everybody that the regular driver, her husband, had been taken sick with food poisoning I was busy staking out the front seat as mine. No way was I not going to do whatever I had to do to get myself where I could feast my eyes on those legs. When she got everybody loaded on the bus and then slid under the stearing wheel I knew that I had made the right choice. Her skirt slid up to mid thigh and I got a woodie. She turned to talk to the guys in back and as she did her eyes swept past me and I know she noticed the tent in my trousers because there was a minute pause in her turn followed by the ghost of a smile on her face. Once she was facing the back she said: 

 "My husband told me what the plan for the night was, but I have never been to a titty bar so you guys are going to have to guide me. Where to?" 

 That announcement brought out a bunch of hoots and hollers and a few ribald remarks, a couple of which caused Christina to blush. Harry told her where our first stop was and she started the bus and we headed out to begin the night. 

 +++++ 

 While everyone had been getting on the bus Harry and Harv had loaded three picnic coolers full of beer and by the time the bus pulled up in front of the Landing Strip Lounge everyone had downed at least two. The group was getting a little on the rowdy side and I almost felt sorry for Christina, but she was putting up with it and I somehow got the impression that she was kind of liking the attention she was getting. 

 We all piled off the bus and Chris said that she was going to recline her seat and take a nap and that we should wake her up when we were ready to go. 

 "Oh no" said Jerry, "You are part of the group and you are going in with us." 

 She protested, but the rest of the guys followed Jerry's lead and she was pulled out of the bus. Dave took her chauffeur's cap off and long blond hair cascaded down and almost reached her ass. Next it was get her jacket off as Dave said: 

 "Can't have you looking like the hired help." 

 The jacket off Christina stood there looking nervously around as all of us stood there and drooled. The jacket had been loose and bulky and had served to hide the magnificent upper body that did justice to the gorgeous legs below. I stood there looking at her wondering why the hell I should go into the Landing Strip and pay good money to see something that wasn't going to be half as nice naked as what I was looking at fully clothed. But the crew surged toward the door of the Landing Strip pulling Christina along with them and I had no choice but to follow. 

 The high spot of our time at the Landing Strip wasn't Monte getting huge ta-tas rubbed all over his face during the three lap dances we bought him (although he did enjoy the hell out of them). No, the high spot was the lap dance we bought Christina. She had blushed like hell when the dancer's tits rubbed against hers and when the dancer had kissed her neck and nibbled on her ear and she might have been embarrassed at the start, but she had loved it. She was a different person when we left the Strip and climbed on the bus to head off to the next strip club. She was a little looser with the guys and even exchanged a wisecrack or two with them. As soon as we were on the bus everyone got a beer from the coolers (except Chris of course) and we headed for the Pink Pussy Cat Lounge. 

 We didn't have to try and talk Chris into going into the Pussy Cat with us - she led the charge. She wanted to have one drink with us, but we wouldn't let her. We still had three more clubs to go to after the Pussy Cat and we told her we would let her have a few when we got to the last one. Lack of alcohol didn't slow her down one bit as she was as loud as the rest of us. Monte got two more face rubs as we all cheered the busty ladies on and then it was back out to the bus, more beers from the coolers and then we were on our way to the Carnival Club. 

 Monte got three lap dances at the Carnival, but the high point at the club was Christina again. We were sitting there cheering on the girl who was assaulting Monte with her 42DDs when a guy came up to us and asked Christina what time her set was. "Set?" she asked. 

 "Yeah? When are you on? I'm saving all my money for a lap dance from you honey" and he pointed at a table. "I'm sitting right over there. I'm a big tipper honey, you won't be sorry for doing me first." 

 That set up a raucous chorus of, "Do it Chris, do it Chris, make us proud Chris." You can never be sure about these things, but I'd bet good money that from the light in her eyes that if she would have had a few drinks in her she would have done it. The guys were still chanting, "Do it Chris, do it" when the stripper who had been giving Monte his lap dance came over and said: 

 "You should think about it honey. You got the looks for it and we are looking for new girls." 

 "How much would I make?" 

 "Depends on how hard you want to work at it honey. Anywhere from four hundred to a thousand a night." 

 "Oh wow" Chris said, licking her lips. 

 Would she? I was almost sure that she would, but before I could find out Harry called out: 

 "Okay everybody, all aboard the bus for the next stop." 

 We all got back on the bus and I grabbed the front seat again. Chris slid behind the wheel and wiggled around on the seat until her skirt had ridden up so high that I could just barely see a hint of her panties. She saw me looking and she winked at me and smiled at me for a second or two and then said: 

 "Okay, where to next?" 

 "The Top Hat Gentleman's Club" Harry said and gave her directions. 

 On the way the guys hit the beer coolers again. I passed on having another one. I was beginning to think of taking a shot at Chris and I didn't want to be too impaired when I did it. 

 What with the beers from the coolers and the drinks they had had at the clubs we'd been to the guys were feeling no pain when we got to the Top Hat. They weren't really drunk, just very, very rowdy. We hadn't been at the Top Hat five minutes when the girl giving Jimmy a lap dance hauled off and slapped him, got up and stormed off. A minute later a bouncer came to the table and politely reminded us all of the rules - you were not allowed to touch the girls with your hands. Ten minutes later the girl giving Carl a lap dance jumped up and called him a fucking asshole and thirty seconds later three bouncers politely escorted us out of the club. 

 "That ended way too soon," Danny said. "I got an idea. How about you do a strip and lap dances for us Chris?" 

 All of a sudden the guys all had money in their hands and they were waving it and chanting, "Do it Chris, do it, do it." 

 Carl said, "I've got four hundred her Chris and it's all yours." 

 "I've got two fifty" Jimmy chimed in and Ralph said he had three hundred." 

 Christina was saying, "I can't" and "Hubby wouldn't like it" and "Sorry, but that just isn't part of the service." 

 More money was flashed and the "I cant's" were gone and she was saying things like, "I wouldn't be any good at it" and "I really don't know how." The guys kept working on her and there was an instant there when I thought she was going to do it. It was like we were holding our breath waiting for her to start dancing and then suddenly it was gone. She gave a dismissive wave and sat down behind the wheel and asked where to next. 

 Harry started to tell her how to get to the next place on the list when Monte interrupted him. 

 "I've got an idea, let's raid Daphne's batchelorette party." 

 Everyone thought that would be fun so Monte gave Chris directions. Daphne was having her going away shindig at the home of her best friend Kate. We pulled up in front of the house and all piled out. Chris said she would wait and we told her no. 

 "You are part of our group sweetie and where we go, you go." 

 Monte tried the front door but it was locked so as quietly as we could manage the whole herd of us went around the side of the house and through the gate in the privacy fence. As we got closer to the back of the house we heard the sounds of partying. We heard: 

 "Do it, do it, do it," being chanted by a bunch of female voices and a "You go girl" and a "Way to go Daphne, way to go." 

 We came around the corner of the house to see a large covered patio. There were a dozen women sitting in chairs watching and cheering as a naked Daphne on her hands and knees sucked the cock of a man in front of her while another man was behind her sliding his cock back and forth in her pussy. Both men had the parts of police uniforms on and there was a large boom box on the table playing music. It looked like they were male strippers hired to do what Daphne wouldn't allow at Monte's party. 

 Almost at the same time Carl said, "Oh fuck!" Dave said, "Jesus Christ!" Jimmy said, "Worthless cunt!" and Harry said, "Fucking whore!" 

 The women all turned to face us and one of them said, "Oh my God." Monte just stood there and stared at his intended for several seconds and then he turned and headed back to the bus. Daphne either didn't hear what went on or she was so caught up in what she was doing that she didn't care. She was still sucking and getting fucked as we all turned and followed Monte back to the bus. 

 I was walking next to Chris and she said, "Was that her?" 

 I nodded a yes and she said, "Oh sweet Jesus, that poor guy." 

 It was a somber and sober group on the bus on the way back to Dave's house. Monte was sitting there and staring out the window and saying nothing as the guys said things like: 

 "Better you found out now buddy, instead of after you got married." 

 We were almost to Dave's when I had the thought and I leaned over and whispered to Christina: 

 "Would you like to help ease his pain and make a grand in doing it?" 

 "What do you mean? How?" 

 "Do a strip and give him a lap dance. Take his mind off of her." 

 She looked up into the rear view and looked at Monte and then she nodded and said, "Okay, but on one condition." 

 "Name it." 

 "You all have to promise that my husband never learns of it. No one except those that are here right now ever knows about it." 

 "You got it." 

 I turned and said, "Listen up guys. Dig your cash out. Christina is going to do a strip and give Monte a lap dance" and then I told them the condition. A loud chorus of Yea's followed and when we got to Dave's we all trooped of the bus and went into the house. Dave set up the stereo system and Chris picked out a CD. It was the sound track from "Coyote Ugly" and she handed it to Dave, he put it in the player and pushed the button. 

 Christina had put her uniform cap and jacket back on and when the music started she looked nervously around and then hesitantly started unbuttoning her jacket. As the yells of encouragement came she started loosening up a little and then little by little she began to get into it. She swayed to the music as she unbuttoned her jacket and tossed it aside. Next she took off her cap and sailed it across the room as her long blonde hair fell to her waist. 

 She was really starting to get into it as her fingers went to the buttons on her blouse as she dipped and twirled in front of the guys. Monte was sitting in a dinning room chair in the middle of the room facing the couch. Dave, Carl and Harry were sitting on the couch and the rest of us were sitting on dining room chairs or sitting on the floor. Chris swung by the couch and dropped her blouse on Harry's head. The skirt went next and she dropped it on Carl's lap. 

 Clad now in only her bra, panties, high heels and thigh high nylons she moved back in front of Monte. She cupped her bra-clad tits in her hands and leaned forward and rubbed them on Monte's forehead and then down across his nose and to his mouth before stepping back. She did some more dips and twirls to the music as she reached behind her and unsnapped her bra. She let it slip down her arms and as she twirled by me she draped it across my right shoulder and blew me a kiss. 

 My cock was as hard as piece of granite and I wanted to take it out and stroke it, but I was afraid that if I did I would break the mood and Chris would stop what she was doing so I sat there and suffered. 

 Tits bare, Chris moved in front of Monte again, moved forward, straddled him and then pushed her tits against his face and rubbed them around. From where I was sitting I saw Monte tongue come out and lick them and I was surprised when she didn't pull away. I was even more surprised when she slid down to plant herself on and squirm around on what just had to be a rock hard cock. She ground her butt on his lap for maybe thirty seconds and then she cupped her tits in her hands again and slowly stood up until the engorged nipples were even with his mouth. We all heard her hoarsely say: 

 "Suck them. Lick my nipples and suck them." 

 Monte didn't hesitate a second and his mouth locked onto her right breast and his hand came up and grasped the left one. She let him feast for thirty seconds and then she pulled away. She turned her back to him and wiggled her ass at him as she pushed her panties down to her ankles and then kicked them away. She spread her legs wide, bent at the waist and grabbed her ankles and looked back between her legs at Monte. He couldn't help himself; no man could have at that point. He took out his cock and started to stroke it and everyone looked at Christina expecting her to bolt from the room. 

 She let go of her ankles, shuffled backwards and sat down on Monte's lap. He was hard, she was wet, his cock split her pussy lips and she rammed herself down on him. Monte grabbed her hips and started fucking up into her as she started raising and lowering herself on his cock. Everyone was stunned and they all sat there open mouthed as the married bus driver started riding Monte's cock. 

 I was as shocked as everyone else, but I had also spent most of the night wondering how I could go about doing just what Monte was doing. And what the hell, I had been the one to talk her into doing it so I felt that I had some rights. I was up and off my chair and standing in front of Christina with my hard cock pointing at her face while the rest of the guys were just coming to grips with what was happening. 

 Chris looked up at me and I saw the lust in her eyes and I took her head in my hands and pulled her mouth onto my cock. I felt her tongue swirl around my shaft and I let go of her head and stood there while she rode Monte's cock and sucked mine. I came first and moved out of the way and Harry took my place. Then Monte came and when Chris got up from his limp cock Carl quickly slid onto the chair and pulled Chris down onto his hard on. 

 While Carl was fucking her and Harry was face fucking her Dave was blowing up an air mattress. By the time Carl came Dave was lying on his back and Chris was pulled over to the mattress and placed on her knees with her head over Dave's erect pole. As she lowered her head to take it in her mouth Harv moved in behind her and slid his cock into her cum filled pussy. After that Chris was one very busy bus driver as all fourteen guys paid homage at her shrines.  

 

 ****** The Bachelor Party Pub Crawl ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© After everyone had done her once Monte moved into position to get his cock sucked and I moved behind her to take her pussy, but she pulled away from me and then pushed me down on my back. She swung over me and settled down on my cock and reached for Monte's cock. She pulled him to her mouth and licked his cock several times like she was licking an ice cream cone and then said, in a voice fairly dripping with lust: 

 "In my ass. I want you in my ass bachelor boy, put your cock in my ass." 

 She leaned forward, her tits pressing into my chest and sent her tongue searching in my mouth and then she broke the kiss and whispered: 

 "Pull out so he can get some lube on his dick." 

 I took my cock out and Monte fucked her pussy for about a minute and then he pulled out and while he was rubbing his cock head against her anal rosebud I pushed back into her cunt. She started kissing me again and her tongue probed my mouth as I felt Monte's cock rub against mine through the thin membrane that separated us. Chris moaned as Monte pushed more and more of his cock into her and then he slowly started fucking her. 

 It was difficult trying to get a rhythm going so I settled for pushing up into her as deeply as I could go and then letting her movements work on my cock. It took almost ten minutes of hard pounding before Monte grunted and sent his load deep into her ass. As soon as he pulled out of her I wrapped my arms around her, rolled her over on her back and started fucking her as fast and as hard as I could. It took me about two minutes to get off and as I was getting up from her Dave was already on his way to take my place. 

 The show that Chris, Monte and I had put on had fired everybody up again and again Chris was a very busy young lady for a while. Carl tried to get into her ass, but she told him no, that her ass had been a special treat for just Monte. 

 After she had dressed I held her arm as she walked unsteadily out to the mini- bus. I held the door for her as she gingerly slid under the wheel. She turned to me and said: 

 "I was bad, really, really bad wasn't I?" 

 I smiled at her and said, "Yes you were Christina and it was great." 

 "I didn't mean to do what I did. I only meant to do Monte to try and cheer him up." 

 "I think it is safe to say that you did do that. I'm glad I talked you into it. I'm only sorry that I didn't get a chance at that beautiful ass of yours." 

 "Yes, but you did get a lot more than you had any right to expect." 

 She leaned toward me and kissed me on the mouth and her tongue flicked in before she pulled back and said: 

 "Remember, no one and I mean no one, ever knows" and she started the bus and drove away. 

 I had intended to give Chris the thousand out of my own pocket, but when all the guys dug out their cash and tossed it in Christina's chauffeurs hat I waited to see what happened and then I matched the highest amount offered (Carl's four hundred). Christina walked out of Dave's that night with a huge smile and thirty-one hundred in her pocket. 

 +++++ 

 I wasn't there for the conversation so I have no idea what went on, but Monte and Daphne went through with their wedding. I don't know, but maybe he thought what he did with Chris cancelled out what she had done with the strippers. I hope it works out for them because I like them both. Three months later I was having dinner with an out of town client and I asked him what he would like to do after dinner. He said he wanted to go to a topless bar. 

 "I've never been to one and I can't do it at home because my wife would be sure to find out about it and she would kill me." 

 I took him to the Pink Pussy Cat and I'll be damned if one of the dancers wasn't Christina. She joined us at the table and I bought her a drink and paid her to do a lap dance for Norm and when she finished she leaned over and whispered in my ear: 

 "I get off at eleven. Meet me at the Denny's over on 6th." 

 I dropped Norm at his hotel and headed for Denny's. I was sitting in a booth sipping coffee when she came in and slid onto the seat across from me. 

 "Surprised?" 

 "An understatement if there ever was one." 

 "It is all your fault." 

 "Mine?" 

 "You were the one who talked me into doing it for Monte. I had such a ball and got such a charge out of it that I just had to do it again." 

 "The lap dances or the other?" 

 "Both." 

 "What happened? Hubby find out and leave you?" 

 "Yes and no." 

 "And that means?" 

 "He found out because I told him and no, he didn't leave." 

 I raised an eyebrow at that. 

 "I had to tell him because I knew I was going to do it again and I love him enough that I couldn't do it behind his back. It turns out that my husband has always wanted to see me make it with another man. When I told him what I had done he told me his fantasy and then said that given what I had just done I shouldn't have any problem giving him what he wanted." 

 "And did you?" 

 "Once or twice a week and if I remember it right you said you were sorry you didn't get a taste of my ass. Would you like to be the one to follow me home tonight?" 

 "Does a duck walk barefoot on the beach? Lead the way sweetie." 

 Her hubby didn't just watch, he also played and I had no trouble double teaming his wife with him. I've been invited back and I'll keep going and doing my absolute best to keep getting invited back. 

 But as I said in the beginning, I saw how easy it was to cross the line. I know Daphne loved Monte, but she still had no problem with taking on two male strippers. Chris was married and yet she didn't have a problem with taking on fourteen of us in a gangbang and has no problem with fucking other men in front of her husband. I've seen how easy it was for Chris and Daphne to cross the line between fidelity and infidelity and I often wonder if I'll ever be able to get married and not spend all my time worrying about what my wife might do.
