Becky Was Bad (A)
=================
#1 

===

She had worked on me for over two weeks to talk me into coming to this party and I had to admit that my reservations about meeting and getting along with her co-workers were groundless. I was getting along great with them although I did wonder why the women, especially those talking in groups, kept looking my way. I kept wondering if I'd left my fly open. The men there seemed to be mostly my age and in talking with them I found that we had a lot in common. Several were old car buffs and they wanted to talk about the problems I had encountered, and was still encountering, in rebuilding my 1965 Mustang. All of them seemed to be sports nuts and with our fair city having five professional sports teams (if you count soccer) there was plenty to talk about. They were a very friendly bunch and went out of their way to help me fit in. I knew that my wife Becky was going to be in a major "I told you so" mood when we got home that night and I resigned myself to it. 

+++++++++++ 

Becky and I had been married six years when the company that I worked for went bankrupt. Regardless of all the talk about the economy being so great I had a hard time finding a job that paid as well as my previous job and I ended up taking on two jobs, one full and one part time, to help us stay ahead of our bills and keep us afloat while sending out resumes. Becky decided that she was going to go back to work so I could give up the part time job. It took her a week but she landed a job as a secretary/bookkeeper at a local warehouse distribution center. The money was enough to allow me to quit one of my two jobs, but I decided not to, at least just yet; I felt the need to build up the savings account against the next potential disaster. 

Between Becky's job and my two we didn't have a well ordered home life and sometimes we would go with out speaking to each other for days; she would be asleep when I got home and I would be asleep when she left for work. As you might imagine, it played hell with our sex life. We did seem to make up for it when we did manage to get together and it didn't seem to be that much of a problem. This went on for over a year and I finally found a job that paid almost as much as I had been making at my bankrupt employer. 

Once I began keeping regular hours I began to notice things that I hadn't been around to notice before. Things like the overtime Becky was working, the phone calls she got in the evenings from her co-workers asking her where things were; where this file or that might be and a couple of times a week she would have to run back to work and take care of someones problem. I hadn't realized that she had become so indispensable in her job. I told Becky that now that we were back on our feet she could quit her job, but she told me that she didn't want to. She said she liked the daily challenges and liked the feeling that they really needed her. This put me in a snit because now that I didn't have to work two jobs I wanted to spend more time with her and I did not want to share her with her job. That was the mood I was in when she asked me to go to the party with her and why I really hadn't wanted to go. 

I was surprised, but I was having a really good time. One of the guys, Ted, asked me if I played pool and when I said I liked to but wasn't very good at it he said it sounded like my game and his were the same. He led me to the basement where there was a pool table and we started playing. He was right; his game wasn't any better than mine and I beat him two games in a row, mostly by using my secret weapon - luck - before a couple of other guys came down and challenged the winner. 

I was on a roll and won three more games in a row against three different guys. Again it was mostly my secret weapon, but a lot of it was due to their dumb mistakes. I had some how managed to find a whole lot of players worse than me. 

And then my life turned to shit. 

I had to take a potty break and luckily, or unluckily as things turned out, there was a half bathroom in the basement. I was standing at the toilet draining the old lizard when I heard voices coming out of the vent just above my head. The ducting for the bathroom must have been pretty close to the duct to a room on the floor above and I could hear quite clearly. 

"Stop you guys. I can't do this here. Not now, not with my husband here." 

It was Becky's voice and a man's voice said, "Don't you worry your pretty little head about your husband baby, we have that angle covered." 

"I don't care" Becky said, "It just isn't right for me to do this when he is here." 

The man said, "Don't worry baby. Ted, Sid and Dale will keep him on the pool table until we are done and then Bill and I will go down and challenge him while Ted, Sid and Dale take their turn. Come on baby, this beats having to sneak out of the house and meet us at a motel." 

Becky said, "I don't care, it's just not glumph" the last word garbled as if something had been stuffed in her mouth and I had a pretty damn good idea what that something was. Confirmation came almost immediately as another man's voice said, "That's it baby, suck my cock." 

I was in the process of shaking the last few drops of my dick when I became aware of the fact that it was hard. Apparently the fact that my wife was being fucked in the room just above my head was more of a turn on than I would have thought. I should have been pissed but instead I was stroking my dick and wondering what she looked like with other guys fucking her. A man's voice said, "That's it Bill, fuck that tight little pussy. God honey, I sure do love the way you can use your mouth." 

There was a muffled reply as Becky tried to say something with her mouth full and the thought made my cock twitch. I remembered all the nights that Becky had been called back into work to take care of a problem and know I knew what those problems were - hard dicks that needed attention. I wondered how long this had been going on; at least the last three months since that is how long I'd only been working one job, but for how long before? 

Upstairs I heard a man's voice say, "Here it comes baby, I'm gonna shoot" and then a frantic Becky "No, no, you can't. I didn't wear my diaphragm tonight, oh god no!" as the man said "Sorry baby, too late." 

Then the other man said "My turn now. God but I love the way you feel when you're full of cum." 

There was a knock on the bathroom door and Ted said, "You all right in there?" 

I opened the door and put a finger to my lips to indicate that I wanted him to be quiet and then I motioned for him to come in. When he hesitated I reached out and grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him in. He started to say something and then he heard through the vent, "That's it Becky baby, wiggle your ass, take my cock all the way in." 

Ted's face paled as he realized that I knew what was going on at both the pool table and upstairs. He started to say something but I again put my finger to my lips and gave him a look that said "Shut up or get a fist in your face." Through the vent I heard a man say, "I'm cumming sweetie" and a garbled noise from Becky (she undoubtedly had a cock in her mouth again) who was probably trying to say please don't, I don't have my protection. Well, I thought, like the first guy had said, too late sweetie, way too late and I wondered if I was going to become a daddy because of the party she'd drug me too. She had at least two loads in her all ready and the night was still young. Upstairs I heard one man say that they needed to get down to the basement and give Ted, Sid and Dale their chance. 

"Don't go away pretty Becky. There will be fresh cock for you in just a minute." 

Becky said, "Are you sure my husband won't find out?" 

And then a man's voice said, "Don't you worry your pretty little head about it baby, we'll make sure he doesn't find out. We don't want to go and ruin a good thing, now do we." 

When the two men, Mark and Bill, came downstairs they found me sitting on the pool table and Ted, Dale and Sid standing off to the side looking worried. Mark said, "Okay, who's got the table? I've got the winner." 

"Well, there seems to be some question about that" I said, "I am probably one of the worst pool players in the world and yet some how I've managed to keep the table long enough for the two of you to fuck my wife. I would even guess that since I still have the table I could probably keep it long enough for Sid, Ted and Dale to go up and do the same. Or am I wrong?" 

Mark looked at me and then over at Ted and the other guys. Ted just shrugged and said; "He heard everything through the vent in the bathroom ceiling." 

Mark looked back at me and spread his hands, "Okay, where do we go from here?" 

I looked at him for a minute and then said, "I've still got the table. If you beat me you all get to go back upstairs and fuck Becky till she bleeds. If I win, all of you have to set me up with your wives, agreed?" 

They all looked at each other and I could see that some of them did not want to agree, but Mark turned to me and said, "Rack them" 

Things did not go my way. Since I had the table I got to break and I sank three solids. I sank two more before I missed. Mark sank one ball and then scratched. I sank two more and then all I had to do was call the eight ball and the game was over, but I didn't want to win. I had no interest in any of their wives - I wanted to watch them with mine. I looked at Mark and then deliberately shot the cue ball into the corner pocket even though the eight ball was at the other end of the table. Mark looked at me as understanding dawned on him and then he smiled and said, "Come on guys, let's go collect our winnings." 

I followed them upstairs and into a bedroom. Becky was lying on the bed with her legs spread and her skirt up around her waist. Her cunt hair was matted with cum and I wondered how she had planned on sneaking that past me tonight. She saw me and panic showed on her unfaithful face and I looked at her and said, "Sorry dear, I lost you to them in a pool game." 

Confusion was still on her face as Ted drove his cock into her. What followed was a gangbang the likes of which I hadn't seen since my college days. As I watched Becky being repeatedly fucked by the five guys, one after another, I wondered why I wasn't angry over the fact that she had been cheating on me and why I was so turned on by watching. While I was watching Ted face fuck her while Mark was fucking her from behind Sid came up to me and said, "Does this mean we can continue fucking her a couple of times a week?" 

I thought about it and said "Sure, why not. You can fuck the slut all you want, but it will have to be at my house so I can be there." 

And then I had a thought, "Are there any guys here who haven't fucked her?" 

Sid thought for a moment and said, "There may be half a dozen that have never had her." 

"Go get them. Tell them what's going on and see if they want to join in." 

Sid left and came back in a few minutes with three guys. 

"There are four more who want to, but most of the wives and girlfriends know what is going on in here and they are keeping a close eye on their men." 

Just then the bedroom door opened and a pretty little brunette walked into the bedroom and said, "Bill, are you going to be much longer?" 

Bill, who had just mounted Becky, said "About twenty minutes sweetie." 

The brunette turned to me and said "I don't do gang bangs, but I do play around some. Can I suck your dick while you watch them fuck your slut?" 

I was caught so completely by surprise that I just stood there speechless. She chuckled and said, "I can see you're not used to straight forward women. That's okay honey, you'll get used to it." 

I don't think I've ever had a better blowjob in my life and I used to think Becky was good. What made it even better were the looks I got from Bill as he was fucking my wife - he was not at all happy that she had my cock in her mouth. I wanted to laugh at him but I was afraid that if I did his wife might stop what she was doing. Bill's wife took her time and it was almost five minutes before I told her I was going to come. Her hands pulled me to her and I swear that the head of my cock hit the back of her throat just as I erupted. She swallowed it all and did not take her mouth off me until I was limp. When it did fall from her lips she licked it a couple of times and said, "Yummy. Maybe we can do this again sometime. Oh by the way, my name is Mary, what's yours?" 

Again she caught me off guard and I stammered out my name. She offered her hand and said, "Pleased to meet you. I'm sure that we will see more of each other, especially if you keep letting these guys use your slut." 

I smiled at her and said, "You say you fool around some. Care to join me at my place?" 

She looked over at her husband who was pounding his cock into my wife and said, "Sure, why not!" 

As we turned to leave Becky cried out "Mikey, don't leave me here." 

I turned and looked at her, with a cock in her ass, a cock in her pussy and one about to be stuffed into her mouth and said, "Sorry. You are the one who decided to be a slut and whore around on me. These eight guys can give you all you want or take all you have to give. Either way I don't care" and I walked out the door. As I escorted Mary to my car I wondered what was going to happen at our house when Becky finally came home. Oh well, I'd worry about that tomorrow.

She had worked on me for over two weeks to talk me into coming to this party and I had to admit that my reservations about meeting and getting along with her co-workers were groundless.

When the two men, Mark and Bill, came downstairs they found me sitting on the pool table and Ted, Dale and Sid standing off to the side looking worried. Mark said, "Okay, who's got the table? I've got the winner." 

"Well, there seems to be some question about that" I said, "I am probably one of the worst pool players in the world and yet some how I've managed to keep the table long enough for the two of you to fuck my wife.

Mark looked back at me and spread his hands, "Okay, where do we go from here?" 

I looked at him for a minute and then said, "I've still got the table. If you beat me you all get to go back upstairs and fuck Becky till she bleeds. If I win, all of you have to set me up with your wives, agreed?" 

They all looked at each other and I could see that some of them did not want to agree, but Mark turned to me and said, "Rack them." 

Things did not go my way. Since I had the table I got to break and I sank three solids. I sank two more before I missed. Mark sank one ball and then scratched. I sank two more and then all I had to do was call the eight ball and the game was over, but I didn't want to win. I had no interest in any of their wives - I wanted to watch them with mine. But as I looked at the faces around the table and saw the worry and fear I changed my mind. These assholes had been fucking my wife on a regular basis and they hadn't given one rat's ass about how I might have felt about it. They had just bet their wives on what they had thought was a sure thing, and without consulting their wives. 

Fuck em! 

I lined up the eight, called the corner pocket and made the shot. I smiled at them and said, "Okay. You want to flip coins or draw straws to see which wife I get first?" 

I looked around and saw what I expected to see, they were going to welch on the deal. I said, "How about yours Dale. I really liked the looks of her tits." 

Dale got a pained expression on his face and said, "Look, I'm sorry that your wife is a slut, but my wife just isn't that way." 

I looked around at the others and said, "Is that the way it's going to be? Okay" I said, "we will do it my way" and before they could say anything I went upstairs and into the living room. 

"Ladies, if I could have your attention please? Would the wives of Bill, Ted, Dale, Sid and Mark please come here?" 

I saw several women look at each other and then five of them walked over toward me. I asked them to follow me into the next room so I could speak to them privately. I saw their husbands come up out of the basement, but they were too late to stop things. Even if they tried to drag their wives away I would talk loud enough so that the women would hear. I told them about what was going on in the bedroom with Becky, how long it had been going on, how I had found out about it and about how their husbands had put them up to cover a wager and had lost. 

"Now they are trying to renege and since I'm a poor loser I thought you should at least know about it." 

One pretty little brunette said, "Is this just bullshit or can you prove it?" 

"Find the bedroom that Becky is in and ask her." 

The five of them looked at each other and then they stormed off to find Becky with their husbands trying to stop them. I heard one holler "Here she is" and then five minutes later the pretty brunette came back and said, "When and where do you want me. I'll teach that cocksucker to cheat on me and then put me up as a bet." 

"How about my house and right now?" 

"Let's go!" 

As we walked out of the house Bill tried to grab her and keep her from going, "Get your fucking hands off me you piece of shit!" and she kept walking. When we got to the car I said, "I've had my revenge. You can go on back." 

She looked at me and said, "You might have gotten yours, but I'm just starting on mine. By the way, my name is Mary, what's yours?" 

I told her and she said, "Let's get to your place sweetie. I'm going to give you the best blow job of your life." And she did. 

++++++++++++ 

Becky did not come home the next day. I got a call from her mother saying that she was going to spend a few days over there. It has been five weeks now and I still haven't talked to her. She calls me at home and work a couple of times a day, but I hang up on her. We may talk someday, but not now. 

Over the next two weeks Mary came by my house almost every day, but she's down to several times a week now. She had a long talk with Debbie, Mark's wife, and shortly after Debbie called, and she was followed by Dale's wife Jenny, and Sid's wife Glenda. I have my own little harem going right now. Ted's wife is the only one that hasn't called, but Mary said I can expect her to call any day now. 

I hadn't planned on it working out this way, but I'm not going to complain. I asked Mary how long she planned on punishing Bill and she said "That depends on you sweetie. He was part of a gang bang on your wife and I'm not going to be even with him until I have a gang bang of my own. Your choice, you can keep fucking me from now on, or you can set me up a gangbang and get me out of your life." 

I smiled at her, "Better bring your toothbrush honey. It sounds like you may be around for the rest of my life." 

She smiled back at me and said, "Want a blow job?" 

I smiled at her and said, "Race you to the bedroom."

There are friends, good friend, really good friends and best friends. Best friends can be both the best thing in your life, or the worst, depending on the day and the circumstances. Today I think I'm going to move Brad to the latter category. 

I met Brad when we were both seventeen although it was more than a year and a half later before I knew his name. We both played football, but on different teams. The two schools were cross-town rivals and the rivalry was an intense one. Our first meeting came when I broke out of the backfield on what looked like a clear run to the sticks when all of a sudden a train hit me and I found myself face down in the dirt. As I shook the cobwebs out of my head I grasped the hand that was extended to me and when I was up I saw it was a player from the other team. 

"Nice hit," I said, and he laughed, "Them's the best kind" and he headed for the defensive huddle. 

Almost one year later, at our homecoming game, I broke left coming out of the backfield on a play that was designed to suck the defense to my side, but out of the corner of my eye I saw the ball wobbling in the air like a ruptured duck. The ball had been tipped at the line of scrimmage and I followed it with my eyes and saw the interception. I had the angle and I hit the ball carrier right in the numbers and rode him down. As we were both getting up he said, "I guess you think you owed me that from last year" and I recognized him right away. "Nice hit" he said, and I remembered what he had said the previous year and I gave it back to him, "Them's the best kind." 

That fall we met for the third time when we tried out for football in college and we both went out and got pissy-eyed drunk together when we didn't make the team. That was thirty years ago and we have been best buddies the whole time. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

In college we dated the same girls and it almost seemed like the girls were interchangeable. I'd date one for four or five months and then we would break up and two months later she would be dating Brad. A month later I would find myself going out with a girl that Brad had dated six months earlier. We compared notes on the girls and it led to a lot of getting laid. It wasn't a competition; it was just the way things happened. And then I fell head over heels in love with Becky. She was that rare woman that looked cute, drop dead gorgeous and sexy all at the same time. We stared dating and there never was any doubt in my mind that she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. After I had been dating here for about four months Brad came up to me one day and asked me when I would be moving on to some one else and I asked him why he was asking. 

"Because I'd like to take a shot at her. She looks like the one I might want to make permanent." 

I smiled at him and said, "Sorry good buddy, but that's the way I feel about her too. I'm keeping this one." 

"You always were a rotten bastard," he said. 

Three months later I asked Becky to marry me and she turned me down. She not only said no, but she broke up with me too, "You're too serious and I'm not ready for a commitment like that." 

Two weeks later Brad started asking her out and she dated him for about a month and then dropped him too. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I graduated with a degree in Business Management and went to work for a communications company and Brad graduated with the same degree and went to work for our biggest competitor, but we still stayed the best of friend. We joined the Elks together, took up SCUBA diving and took a couple of diving vacations together to St. Thomas. We got in the habit of having Friday night poker games, went to ball games and other sporting events together, double dated a few times and formed a permanent bond between us. 

About a year after graduation I was at home fixing myself dinner when the front doorbell rang. I answered the door to find Becky standing there. My mouth went dry and I wanted to take her in my arms, but of course I didn't - I would have died if she had tried to pull away. 

"Can I come in?" 

I stepped back and motioned her in. I told her I was fixing dinner and asked her if she had eaten; she said she hadn't and I asked her to join me and she accepted. While I was making a tossed salad she asked me in a very casual way if I was seeing anyone, and I told her no, that I was between ladies at the time. Then she said, also in a very casual tone of voice, "I'm ready for that commitment now." 

We were married six weeks later and Brad was my best man. Thirty happy years and four grown kids later, Becky and I were still married and Brad was still my best friend and then, as they say "Shit happened!" 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It all started on Becky's fiftieth birthday. For some reason that I could never understand becoming fifty depressed the hell out of her. It made no sense to me. She was still sexy and desirable, looked fifteen younger than she was, and still turned male heads. The only major changes in her were about ten more pounds, which only made her look more sensual, and a few gray hairs. At parties and other social events she still got hit on when my back was turned and it never bothered me because when we got home she would tell me all about it and then she would say, "You want to know what I'd do to him if he got me alone?" and then she'd show me. 

But that didn't happen any more. As the days passed she got more and more down in the dumps and our sex life began to suffer. Not willing to let that happen I tackled the problem head on. I told her that being depressed made absolutely no sense at all. She was still attracting male glances; she was still being hit on and that she was as sexy as she had ever been. 

"That's not true," she said," "I only get hit on by guys that know us and who know I'm going to turn them down. It's just flirting, nothing else." 

"Bullshit!" I said, "You could have anyone of them any time you wanted." 

We babbled on about the subject for another ten minutes or so and then dropped it. About a week later I was having lunch with Brad and he made the comment that I didn't seem to be myself lately and I told him about what was going on between Becky and me. 

"What?" he said, "Hell just last week at George's party I saw three different guys trying to score with her and I can promise you the bulges in their pants weren't phony." 

"I know" I said, "But she thinks its all innocent flirting. I almost wish one of those guys would score and prove to her that she is still a sexy and desirable woman."

About three months later Becky and I had just come home from a party and for the first time in over a year Becky said, "I got hit on tonight." 

"Oh?" I said, "And if you were to have gone along with him what would you have done?" 

And she told me she would have taken him to a dark out of the way spot where they could neck without being interrupted, "And then, when I was hot enough I'd do this" and she bent down and started to suck my cock. About a minute later she removed her mouth from me and said, "And then I'd let him fuck me" as she got on her hands and knees in her favorite position. "Go ahead baby. Fuck me like he would have." 

Later I asked her what really happened that night to get her fired up. 

"I told you. I got hit on." 

"Yeah" I said, "But that happens all the time and you told me it was nothing but innocent flirting." 

She said, "I know, but you told me that it wasn't and that they were serious and anyone of them would jump me if I gave them half a chance. I didn't believe you so tonight I decided to prove you wrong. We went out to the patio, found a dark corner and necked. He put his hand on my breast so I put mine on his erection. He was serious; he really did want to fuck me. He took his cock out and put my hand back on it and I knew I'd gone too far. I tried to back away, but he whined that it wasn't fair for me to lead him on like that and then leave him hanging, and I guess he was right. I shouldn't have let things go that far if I wasn't going to go through with it." 

Becky fell silent and I asked, "So what did you do." 

Becky looked down at the floor and said in a soft, low voice, "I gave him a hand job." 

"I don't believe it! You're just making this up." 

She got off the bed and went and got her dress. Bringing it back to the bed she showed me the stains on it, "My aim wasn't too good" she said, and then looking at my rapidly hardening cock she said, "Oh my. Turned on are we? I may just have to give out more hand jobs." 

I couldn't keep my hands off her for the rest of the night.

Three weeks later when we got home from another social event she said, "I got hit on tonight." 

"What happened?" I asked. 

"He asked me when I was going to give in and give him a taste. I said, why not right now? We went outside and necked for a while - he was a really good kisser - and then I let him finger fuck me while I did this," and she took hold of my cock and started to stroke it. "My aim was better tonight so I don't have a messy dress to show you, but I didn't wash my hands when we were done. Would you like to taste him?" 

Yeah, right, I thought as I called her bluff and licked her fingers. There was the unmistakable slightly salty taste of cum on her fingers, I know because I've eaten Becky's pussy plenty of times after cumming in her and I know the taste. Becky looked at the expression on my face and giggled, "You didn't believe me, did you?" and she got in her favorite position and said, "Why don't you do to me what he wanted to do." 

The next morning she said, "I'm glad that you convinced me that the guys were doing more than just flirting. I'm having fun and you are a raging bull when we get home and I tell you about what I did." 

A couple of weeks later following another party, "I got hit on tonight." 

"Tell me about it." 

The same story, but with a difference this time. 

"I was stroking his cock and I had a sudden urge and I went to my knees in front of him and took him in my mouth. He loved it. He grabbed the back of my head so that I had to swallow his juices." I looked at her stunned by what she'd just said and she said, "You don't believe me, do you?" and she kissed me and I tasted him. "Now baby, do what he didn't get to do." 

I was a ragging bull that night and when I woke up in the morning I rolled her still sleeping body over and mounted her again.

I started accepting invitations from people I didn't usually associate with just to give Becky the chance to get hit on. Over the next several months my wife gave out seven hand jobs and five blow jobs and when we got home she would tell me what happened and we would fuck like minks for the next two days. I could not believe how the two of us were acting - we were worse than teenagers. 

One Friday we were at a company promotion party and I hadn't expected anything to happen there because it was a workplace thing and I was sure Becky wouldn't do anything that, if it were to come to light, would embarrass me. 

When we got home Becky said, "I got hit on tonight." I had not expected it so I stood there with my mouth open as she told me the usual story about finding an out of the way place, but when she got to the part where she usually described the hand job or blow job she said, "Now come over here and fuck me like he did," and she got in her favorite position, poked her ass up in the air and I got my first look at her cum soaked pussy hairs. 

I was so astonished that I just stood there and stared at her. "What's the matter baby, you don't want to fuck me like he did? You don't like sloppy seconds? Would you rather eat me? I'd like that." 

"Oh God" I groaned and I went to my knees and buried my face in that mess. For the next two days we did not leave each other alone and when I went to work on Monday it was on wobbly legs. Becky had turned my life into an erotic dream and I was fucking her more than at any other time in our relationship. I was in constant suspense over what she might do next. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Last Thursday we attended a meeting of a church group and on Friday Becky said, "I got hit on last night." 

I was confused, "Last night? What did you do?" 

"Nothing" she said. "At least nothing last night." 

"What does that mean?" I asked. She smiled and said, "I met him at a motel today. He came in my mouth twice and he fucked me three times, once in my ass. Would you like to fuck me now, or eat me?" 

I did both. Another weekend shot because we never left the bedroom except to eat. 

When I came home from work on Tuesday Becky told me, "I've decided to take a lover." 

"Oh?" I said, not sure that I wanted that. Random sex with unnamed partners was one thing (Becky would never tell me who her lovers were), a regular lover was something else. But before I could say anything she said, "I started today and I let him fuck me in our bed. He was here for over four hours and he came in me five times. Would you like a taste? Will you eat me and then fuck me like he did?" 

Six hours ago I got a phone call at work and Becky said, "Would you rather hear about what my lover does to me or would you rather watch?" I sat there with my heart beating fast, holding the phone to my ear, unable to speak and then she said, "He's here now. Listen. I'll hold the phone so you can hear him sliding his big cock into me." 

I didn't hear a damn thing because I had slammed the phone down and was on my way out the door. I got home and went straight to the bedroom and found Brad stuffing his cock into Becky's ass. Becky smiled at me, "I knew you'd come. Can I suck your cock while Brad fucks me?" 

Until I decide what category to put Brad in we are sharing Becky and she is wearing both of us out. She just told Brad and me that since we don't seem to be up to the task she's thinking of finding some one else to help us. I really don't know about that, but on the other hand Brad and I could really use the help. Report_Story
