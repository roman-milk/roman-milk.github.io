 ****** Becoming a Slut Wife: Kathy ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© Sometimes a 'boys night out' can be a pretty life-changing event. I know one of them changed my life - big time! 

 My 'boys night out' has always been a bone of contention between me and my wife Madge. But then it seemed like everything was a bone of contention between us. Truth be told Madge and I never should have gotten married at all. We mistakenly thought that sexual passion was love and when the fire went out about three years after the wedding we suddenly found out that we didn't have anything else going for us. The fact that the marriage stumbled along for the next seven years was more of a tribute to our indifference that anything else. 

 Since I didn't care to stay home and argue with her I filled my nights with bowling leagues, poker parties and other activities, none of which torqued off Madge more than 'boys night out'. That night, which only took place on the average of one night a month, was when a group of us guys would go out drinking, usually to some titty bar, and then I would stagger home at four in the morning and fall into bed. What pissed Madge off was that she was a light sleeper and when I fell onto the bed I woke her up and she couldn't fall back to sleep. The end result was that she would be bitchy and irritable and would whine about it all the next day. I could have put an end to it by simply ending the marriage, but I was just too lazy (or too cheap to pay a lawyer) to go to the effort. 

 Six years ago a 'boys night out' changed all that. It changed the lives of several others also, some for the better and some for the worse. As usual it took place on a Friday night. One of the guys had heard about a new titty bar in Newton, a town about thirty miles from us. We had plenty of titty bars in town and we hardly ever went anyplace else, but that night the boys were feeling adventurous. The group was short one man that night. Norm's wife had gone back to school and she was working nights as a security guard to earn the money to pay for it. Imaging Kathy as a security guard was a major, major stretch of the imagination and we all tried to picture it until she laughingly broke down and told us that all she had to do was monitor TV screens and call the cops if she saw anything. 

 Anyway, Norm had to stay home and watch the kids. We made the trip to Newton, got a fairly good table and settled in to enjoy ourselves. We had just ordered our second round when Harry sat straight up in his chair and said, "Holy sweet Jesus!" We all looked at him and he pointed, "Is that who I think it is?" and we looked in the direction he was pointing and my jaw almost hit the floor. On the other side of the room, giving a customer a lap dance was Norm's wife Kathy. We all watched as Kathy did everything except fuck the guy. 

 Mack said, "You think Norm knows or does he really believe the security guard bullshit?" 

 None of us could answer that question. Over on the other side of the room Kathy had finished her lap dance and she went into the back room. Two minutes later the girl on the stage finished her set, the music changed and Kathy came on the stage and began her dance. We had all seen Kathy in a bikini at pool parties or picnics at the beach and we knew that she had a great body, but we had never seen this Kathy. She fairly radiated sex as she twisted and turned, dipped and strutted for her audience along the length of the stage and allowed them to tuck bills in her bikini bottoms and the garters she had on her legs. I watched her work her way toward our end of the stage and I wondered what would happen when she saw the five of us sitting there. It was not at all what I expected. I saw the instant recognition in her eyes, but her routine never missed a beat and she never gave any indication that she knew us, not even when Mack tucked a five into her waist band. 

 When her set was over she came straight for our table and sat down. As usual a waitress immediately appeared and we were supposed to buy the dancer a drink. The way it worked was the dancer ordered champagne or some other high dollar drink that that we would pay for and then the waitress would bring the dancer ginger ale or soda water - something non-alcoholic that looked like what the dancer had ordered. As soon as the formalities were taken care of and the waitress had gone Kathy said, "You guys going to tell Norm?" 

 Now Norm is a good friend, but Kathy was a friend too and I had no doubt in my mind that Kathy was dancing here because it paid one hell of a lot more than being a security guard. I couldn't see that it was hurting Norm at all and I didn't see any need to upset the apple cart, but before I could say anything Harry said, "How bad do you want to keep it from him?" 

 I saw a side of Kathy I'd never seen before. Her eyes went hard and she said in a flat voice, "What are you getting at Harry?" 

 Harry said, "What are you willing to do to insure that we keep our mouths shut? How far are you willing to go?" 

 Kathy looked around the table at each of us and then said in a cold flat tone, "I'll do whatever it takes." 

 Harry said, "I've watched you parade your body around us for years in bikinis that left nothing to the imagination. I want that body. That's my price." 

 Kathy looked around the table again, "All of you feel that way?" 

 When her eyes met mine I said, "Not me. I'll have no part of this" and I saw something in her eyes but I don't know what it was. 

 She said, "All right. I get off at eleven. I'm not allowed to have anything to do with customers so you will have to meet me away from here." 

 Harry said, "No problem. I'll get a room at the at the other end of town. You can meet us there." 

 Kathy gave him a hard look and then she got up and walked away. I just sat there and watched as the guys laughed and high-fived each other and talked about their good luck. Mack looked at me, "What's the matter with you?" 

 I just shrugged, "You all seem to be forgetting that Norm is our friend and that's Norm's wife you are so gleefully getting ready to blackmail." 

 He said, "You've seen my wife. Do you honestly think I would pass up a chance at something as nice as Kathy given the chance? Besides, Norm doesn't know she's dancing here and it hasn't hurt him and he won't know about what we are going to do so that won't hurt him either. One other thing to think about; do you really think she would go along with this if all she was doing here was dancing?" 

 I looked at him, "What's that supposed to mean?" 

 He snorted. "You saw that lap dance. She did everything but fuck him. What do you want to bet that she gets off at eleven, but dear old Norm doesn't get to see her till three or four. What do you think she is doing with those extra hours? I know what I think and I'm betting that it pays more than dancing." 

 I remembered Norm telling me that the worst part of Kathy's job was being woke up at three in the morning when she got home. If she did get off at eleven what did she do with those extra hours? Still, she was a friend and what the guys were going to do was wrong. 

 I said I wasn't going to be a part of it, but to an extent I was. We had all come in my car so I was stuck with staying with the group. I seriously thought of just driving straight home so they couldn't put their plan into play, but then I couldn't be sure that they wouldn't blab to Norm. We pulled in at the motel and Harry went in and got a room and then everyone went inside and waited for Kathy. I went in with the rest of them with the intention of leaving and waiting in the car when Kathy got there. That intention, while noble, didn't last past Kathy's arrival in the room. 

 There was no bullshit or pleading, she walked to the bed and with out saying a word she stripped and laid down. In a voice totally devoid of emotion she said, "Who's first," and then she just layed there waiting. 

 The guys all looked at each other. They had been expecting the cheerful, bubbly Kathy that they had always known. Harry finally undressed and got on the bed with her. He pushed her legs apart and she just looked up at him with a blank face as he drove into her. She just lay there and didn't make a sound or move as Harry humped into her. Watching the other guy's watch I knew that Harry was going to be the only one to fuck her. I saw the guys looking at nervously at each other and I could read their expressions - "What the fuck are we doing here?" Two more minutes and the guys would have gone outside and waited for Harry and we would have all gone on home. But two minutes can be a long time and a lot can happen in that time frame. 

 Mack got up and was moving toward the door when a low moan came from the bed and we turned and saw her legs come up and wrap around Harry. Seconds later her hands came up and grabbed his ass and her hips started pushing up at him. I looked at the other guys and again I could read their expression -"Hey, this is more like it" and clothes started coming off and on the bed Kathy was hissing at Harry, "Fuck me you miserable bastard, fuck me." 

 Harry lasted about five minutes and as he started to pull away from her she grabbed him and tried to pull him back down, "No, no, no, not yet, I'm almost there, damn you I'm almost there." 

 Mack grabbed Harry by the shoulders and pulled him off Kathy and shoved him out of the way and he was on her and in her in a flash. Arms and legs came up to grabbed him, "Oh yes oh yes oh yes oh god fuck me fuck me fuck me" and then she gave a loud wail as she came. Mack didn't slow down, he kept ramming his cock into Kathy's pussy and she started moaning again and Mack said, "God is she one hot fuck" and Kathy moaned "Oh yes oh yes oh yes please don't stop please don't stop." 

 Of course he eventually had to, but Billy was standing there to immediately take his place. Jeff had been standing there, watching and stroking his cock while waiting his turn, but he got impatient and walked over to the bed and poked his cock at Kathy's mouth. She took it and started sucking on it. All thoughts of my going out to sit in the car were gone. I could not take my eyes off what was happening on the bed. Billy came and Jeff took his place. Harry took Jeff's place until Jeff came and then he moved to her pussy and Mack moved to her mouth and it just kept on going as one after another they moved from mouth to pussy while Kathy had orgasm after orgasm all the while moaning "oh yes oh yes fuck me fuck me don't stop fucking me." 

 I happened to look at my watch and saw that it was almost three in the morning. The guys had been fucking Kathy non-stop for almost four hours. "Hey guys" I interrupted the party, "It's three o'clock. She's got to get home if she wants to stay out of trouble." 

 There was a lot of grumbling, but the guys started getting dressed. Kathy lay on the bed staring up at the ceiling and I have no idea what she thinking, but she was showing no sign of getting a move on. The guys started leaving and I tossed them my keys and told them to go on without me. 

 "I'll get her cleaned up and drive her to my place and she can drive home from there." 

 The door closed behind them and Kathy, still staring up at the ceiling said, "I guess that I let that one get away from me." 

 I shrugged, "We need to get you into the shower. You can't go home looking like this." 

 She turned her head and looked at me, "Why didn't you join in. You must have noticed that after the first five minutes I was all too willing." 

 I shrugged again, "Yeah. But it still wasn't right. Besides, you're my friend and I couldn't do that to you." 

 She looked me in the eye and said, "But I want you to." I just looked at her and she said, "I want you to because you are my friend. If you don't the next time you see me you will look away from me embarrassed by what you saw here tonight. I don't want that. I appreciate that you weren't an asshole like the rest, but I need you to fuck me now if for no other reason so that we will still be able to see each other and talk to each other like we always have. If you fuck me, we are in it together. Am I making sense?" 

 She reached for my zipper and as she tugged it down all my good intentions were history. She pulled my cock out, "I'm a little sloppy down there baby, but no one used my ass tonight. My ass is my gift to you for being so sweet and for being my friend." 

 When it was over we showered together which was a mistake. As our hands moved over each other as we washed each other's back the hands strayed and we didn't get out of that motel room until two fucks and a blow job later. It was five thirty when we reached my house and as I climbed out of the car she reached over and grabbed my arm and pulled me back; she kissed me and said "I get off every night at eleven Tuesday through Friday, don't be a stranger." 

 It wasn't supposed to happen, but it did. Word got out about that night and made its way back to Norm. I'm not sure, but I think that it was Mack. I don't have any firm proof, but he showed up one night at the strip club hoping for a repeat performance and Kathy told him that she had paid the price and to get out. I'm betting that he put the word out for spite. Norm confronted Kathy and she told him everything except the part where we made love. The others had gone before what happened between us happened so we were the only two who knew. I felt like a prime asshole when Norm thanked me for being his only true friend. 

 He and Kathy were divorced and after he had drug all the other guys through the divorce proceedings he ended up with the kids and then to spite Kathy more than anything he moved them across the country. She has visiting rights but it is a little hard to exercise them when the kids are in Delaware and she is in Colorado. Fittingly enough, when the information from Norm's divorce proceedings got out the wives of the other four hauled them into court and the lawyers stripped them clean. Jeff is the only one who didn't get hurt. He didn't have a pot to piss in and he didn't like his wife anyway. 

 After my night with Kathy I started driving over to see her and found out what she did with those hours from eleven to three. The owner of the strip club let her use his office to study and do her home work from school. We went for coffee on several nights and talked and a couple of those nights we ended up at the motel. And one night I was there and she told me she was sorry, but she had a date that night. The next day she called me and asked me to meet her for coffee. 

 "You know what I'm doing now, right?" 

 I shook my head no. 

 "My date last night was a financial arrangement. Are you surprised at that?" 

 I admitted that I was. 

 "That night when all of you had me in that motel room I learned something about myself. I found that I loved what happened to me. I found out how much I loved multiple partners, but at the same time I realized that there was no percentage in giving it away and becoming known as an easy slut. Last nights date was actually a private party for five of the strip clubs partners. I still want to see you and I enjoy your company, but I wanted you to know the kind of girl I've turned out to be. If you stop coming over to watch me dance I'll understand." 

 That was six years ago. About four months after Norm sued Kathy for divorce I told my wife that I wanted to end the sham that we were calling a marriage and she was agreeable. We split everything fifty-fifty and I paid the legal expenses. She eventually remarried and she seems to be a lot happier now than she was when we were together. Two months after my divorce was final and a month after Norm left town I asked Kathy to move in with me and a year later we got married. She still works at the strip club and she still does private parties. I don't care and in fact it turns me on when she comes home to me after a gangbang. As I'm fucking her I am reliving the first one in my mind and somehow it keeps me hard even after I cum. 

 She has asked me several times if I want to go to one of her private gatherings with her, but I've always said no. It was one thing when it was spontaneous as it was the first time, but something else again when it is prearranged and for pay. 

 "Okay" she said, "How about getting several really good friends, guys who can be discrete, and have a poker party. I'll bet I can make it memorable for them." She grinned, "Maybe we could even make it a weekly thing." 

 Not a bad idea I thought, not a bad idea at all. Report_Story
