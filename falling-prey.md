Falling Prey

This is a tentative, possible first chapter of a series. Further additions are dependent on any feedback this piece may receive. 

Thanks to those who took the time to cast an eye over what follows. I listened to suggestions and took what I agreed with, so if you don't like this effort, then the blame lies solely with me. 

* 

In this part of the world the month of October means an abrupt ending to the days, with the night taking hold by 5pm, retaining its grip for long, dark hours with an iron hand before grudgingly letting go more than twelve hours later. For me it's the finest time of the year. The anticipation builds slowly as the summer softly wanes towards the autumnal equinox, following which will be time for me to hunt again. I know she's out there, somewhere close, going about her daily business with no inkling of what's to come; ignorant to the malevolence. 

Ah, the anticipation as the hunger grows. I resist the urge to masturbate despite the craving for release. Blunting my instincts by succumbing could cost me my quarry. A winter without her is long, cold, and bitterly desperate for a creature such as me. I suffered lean years in my youth, in the time before I honed my skills; the darkest being Paris, 1917. That bitch of a caf√© girl and her cats. Two years without feeding. A third would have been fatal to me. No, I wouldn't succumb to desire. 

My favourite hunting ground in this modern age is the shopping mall. All the possibles herded into one small area. How very convenient for me. This year the stalk was quickly over. Appropriately I found her on the eve of Samhain. 

I was sipping an americano -- a recently acquired taste -- at one of the ubiquitous coffee stalls when I sensed her. She was very close. All that remained was the simple matter of surveying the passing hordes, scanning the crowd, disregarding each disappointment one by one until I experienced a near physical shock and my heart quickened. It was her. She was so close I could smell her. My cock immediately stiffened to iron tumescence while my stomach tightened in sympathetic anticipation. The coffee forgotten I suppressed a groan and gazed at the quarry. 

She walked with leonine grace that was instantly recognisable to me, moving with the elegance and style of that rare one, the one who can satisfy my hunger; my urges. I pictured her naked in my mind's eye; holding an image of her supine and used amidst a tangle of bedding; her hair messed; bosom heaving with spent exertion, her skin moist with her sweat and my semen. I growled, low and snickering before rising quickly to follow. 

The most fragile time was coming; I needed to act with caution. The moment of meeting was crucial. In that instant she would make her decision. The plain and simple truth of it was that if she sensed anything at all about my intent; if she didn't like the look of me; if there wasn't an instant attraction . . . Then all would be lost for this season. There are tricks of the trade of course, but it has been known for the prey to sense the danger. And in that moment Schroedinger's cat is dead. 

She browsed at length, slowly, moving from shop to shop with me never far behind. Eventually she paid for her parking and walked briskly to the stairwell. I followed, skulking down the dank-walled flights of concrete steps, always keeping a landing between us until she pushed open a door to the concourse and approached a car. Using the electronic key she unlocked the car door and, even as the lights flashed I'd committed the registration to memory. I smiled as she drove down the ramp towards the street level. I may be a creature of solitary habits, but I do have my drones in the upper world. My ability to seek out the corruptible, the easily manipulated has its uses. Finding her again would be a simple process, James, my tame policeman, with his predilection for pharmaceuticals would be just the tool. 

*** 

The man, Matthew as he was known currently, approached Helen as she left the free-weights room. It was her second visit to the gymnasium of the three per week her self-imposed routine demanded. Nearing fifty, Helen found a strict exercise regimen kept her feeling invigorated and desirable. Being used to male attention since her late teens, Helen adored the compliments she still received. 

"Excuse me." Helen turned at the hesitant voice. "Would you spot for me?" She surveyed the man, his expression expectant, standing by the weight-room apparatus. "The staff are busy with inductions," he continued, "and since there's nobody but us..." He shrugged. 

"Well, I suppose I could," Helen eyed the bar and its encumbrance, "but it looks rather heavy." 

"You just have to stand here," the man indicated the position with a nod of his head. "And just be ready in case there's a problem." There was a pause before he hurriedly added, "Which of course there won't be. This weight isn't an issue; it's just club rules, 'no bench press without a spotter'." The man grimaced and rolled his eyes. "Rules are rules I suppose. What do you say? Will you help?" 

"All right then," Helen succumbed, "just remind me exactly what it is I have to do." 

Ten minutes later, freshly showered, Helen was leaving the gym when bench-press man approached. 

"Hello again," he smiled. "Thanks for the help; I appreciate it." 

"No problem," Helen replied, turning to leave. 

"Can I thank you by buying you a drink?" 

The rebuttal formed naturally in Helen's throat; the instinctive rejection of a worldly-wise female. But, as she faced the man to let him down gently, she saw something in his expression; there was something in his look that caught her attention. Helen found herself suddenly intrigued by the stranger. She sensed some element of danger in him; deep and mysterious. There was something more, something undefined that her grasping mind found to be just out of reach. In the weights room, much to her surprise, Helen found her body responding to the man's physical proximity. He was a damn fine specimen; very easy on the eye; but then again he was at least twenty years her junior, and besides, Helen was married to Bobby. It was all very well forming the occasional, quick fantasy, but there was no way she would ever act on it. Then amidst the confusion a shock of emotion welled within her; a dissonance; a whirl of mixed feelings. Bemused by the clamouring of instinct and attraction, and despite a warning like a faint scent of smoke on the wind, Helen made her fatal choice 

To her surprise Helen found herself with a vodka and tonic on the table in front of her in a quiet public house a few doors along from the gym. 

"Oh shit," she muttered after a glance at her watch. Helen had enjoyed his company. So much so that without realising an hour and a half had passed, and during that time Helen had drunk rather more vodka than was wise. "I'd better get going. I have to drive and I've had a couple of drinks already." Helen was surprised at how reluctant she was to leave. She cursed for a second time. "Well," she began as they both stood. "I do have to go. Thanks for the drinks; it really has been fun." 

"I enjoyed myself too, Helen." Matthew moved close and kissed her cheek. "I wonder if..." Matthew broke off. 

"What? You wonder what?" Helen noticed Matthew's expression, seeing the disappointment on his face 

"I don't usually come on like this," Matthew began, his colour rising. "I mean... Well, it's been fun. I like you; I enjoyed your company... Oh hell, what I'm asking is if you'd care to do it again? Have a drink after the gym I mean." 

Helen found his discomfit amusing and more than a little endearing. What harm can it do? she thought. 

"Sure, why not?" Helen's emphatic nod sealed her resolve. "I come in again on Friday. Is that good for you?" 

"Sure. Great!" Matthew grinned. "Friday it is." 

*** 

The moment of crisis is past. She's mine. Oh, but to see her in those clothes; the athletic goddess; the cleave of her cunt in those close fitting shorts so close to my face... I had to fight the urge to take her there and then. The desire to rip the shorts from her body and suck at her juicy peach was vast. I had to pour all my efforts into that damnable bar. The scent of her fresh sweat and those heavy breasts swaying under her tee-shirt... This one is going to be such a delight. 

I admit to a smug satisfaction at my acting ability. My little boy chagrin was her Achilles heel. How shy and awkward I was. However it does best not be too conceited; the moment of asking her for that drink was close to failure. I'm sure she was going to deny me until I poured all my will into her. A dangerous moment to be sure, but now it's done. 

Now to Friday A few more hours in my company will do very nicely. More time to impose my spirit upon her. I'm tempted to move us to the physical sooner rather than later. I yearn for a taste of her. Just thinking about her facial expressions as I push her further along the path to her downfall excites me. I want to touch myself... Just a little... Just a few tugs on my cock... It would be exquisite. 

*** 

Helen experienced a flutter of pleasure as she watched Matthew at the bar. God but he's a magnificent creature.The thought took Helen by surprise. She grew ever more surprised as the fluttering moved to a deeper place, increasing in tempo a pulse that caused her to wriggle in her seat. Stop it, she insisted, just a drink, a harmless drink, nothing more. 

"You okay?" Matthew placed the drinks on the table. "You looked pretty serious there." 

"Fine, it's all fine," Helen breezed, smiling brightly as the lies floated from her mouth. "I was just thinking that it was quite a hectic week; I'm glad it's over." 

Over the course of the next hour, with Matthew so close, Helen felt herself growing more uncomfortable. The pulse between her thighs grew insistent. Her clitoris throbbed with a life of its own. Then, her traitorous nipples added a further aching beat to her body's synchrony. 

"You know, Helen," Matthew started, his voice low and heavy. "I... I..." He coughed to clear his throat. "Excuse me, but there's something bothering me and I just have to get it out in the open." 

"What is it?" Helen asked, with her own discomfiture now acute. 

"I know we've only just met. We're virtual strangers really, but..." Matthew's demeanour was awkward. "Well, it's just that I find you really attractive." He paused, obviously embarrassed. "There, I've said it. I'm sorry... If you want to go, then that's fine, but I just had to tell you. I've been sat here thinking about how sexy you are... Dammit, I can't concentrate." 

Helen stared at the man opposite her. He felt it too? It wasn't just her? There was a frisson between them. The logical part of Helen's brain knew that she should leave now; she should go immediately. She should put down her drink; thank Matthew for his company, and leave. She should go without a backward glance. That would be the sensible thing to do. 

What she did however was entirely different. 

"I know what you mean. I feel it too. My body responds to you being so close." Helen's eyes widened. "What am I saying?" Vehemently she shook her head. "What am I doing?" 

Then Matthew's gaze caught her eyes and she was lost. 

"Phone him," Matthew murmured. "Phone Bobby and tell him you met some colleagues." 

Helen failed to notice the change in Matthew's character, all she heard was the proposal. Gone was the endearing shyness, there was an indefinable element in his tone, a core of steel ran through his words. It was a command, not a suggestion. 

"Yes, honey, I'll be careful. Love you too." After the call to her husband Helen turned the phone off and put it into her bag. She looked at Matthew who, wearing a smirk, appraised her. "I don't believe I just did that," she muttered. "And I don't believe I'm doing this." 

"And just what are you doing, Helen?" 

"I... I don't know. But I've just lied to my husband. I can't believe myself. It's like it isn't me. Someone else is doing this and I'm watching. Like a television programme. I can see how wrong this is, but I can't help myself. Oh dear God," she groaned. 

"Come with me, Helen." 

She took Matthew's hand. It was the first physical contact, other than the kiss on her cheek as they'd parted on Wednesday evening. It was the first touch and despite Helen's deep misgivings she found his firm grasp comforting. 

*** 

How easy it was after all. I couldn't wait. I had to indulge myself. She looks edible tonight. And after all, I plan to eat her. Within half an hour she'll be squirming on my tongue. I'll make her writhe and groan and shout for me to fuck her. How I'll resist her? I don't know if I can. She's going to suck me, but I forbid myself to penetrate her. I can't, not yet, but I will. Soon I'll come inside her. I'll deliver my seed and extract the essence of her when I do. 

Damn, I'm as hard as iron. 

*** 

A brief taxi ride found Helen outside Matthew's home. She hesitated momentarily, as though contemplating her fate before moving quickly across the threshold with a determined stride. 

"Nice," she nodded with approval, surveying the room. 

"Drink?" Matthew offered? 

"I think I'd better." Matthew poured a generous measure of vodka into a glass, and then, after a brief trip to the kitchen for ice and tonic, handed Helen the tumbler. "So..?" she ventured after sipping delicately. "What now?" 

"Now..." Matthew moved to Helen. She stared at him as he calmly took the glass from her hand and touched his fingers to her cheek. "Now you kiss me." 

Surprised at her own bold action Helen opened her mouth and accepted Matthew's tongue as they kissed. She pressed her body against his while their tongues swirled in a serpentine dance. Helen groaned as Matthew's hands roamed over her body. She felt his fingers slide down over her back before pausing to cup her buttocks. His fingers kneaded with firm insistence while, at the same time, Matthew forced Helen harder against his body. She could feel the length of him against her stomach; hard, huge, and persistent. 

"Matthew..." Helen groaned, breathless with shock after the kiss, "I want you," 

"You want this?" Matthew took a step back, unzipping his flies, exposing himself. 

"Yes," Helen sighed, her eyes shining with anticipation when she witnessed his arousal. 

"Strip for me," Matthew commanded. "Strip for me and show me how beautiful you are." Falling deeper under Matthew's control and emboldened by lust Helen rushed to comply, reticence swept away in a rush of desire. Helen's own longing coupled with Matthew's domineering attitude, rendered shyness ridiculous. She, quickly naked, was gratified to hear Matthew's breath hiss sharply in approval. 

"Magnificent," he murmured, "truly magnificent." His fist stroked up and down while committing Helen's body to memory. "Delectable breasts," he continued in the same low tone, "so big, so heavy." The stroking grew more urgent. "You're made for me, Helen. Your hips, your waist, all of you... You excite me." A low, dark growl rumbled from Matthew's throat. "Turn around," he murmured. "Turn and show me your backside." 

Helen did as instructed, performing a slow 360 and giving him a view of her rear as she turned. 

"You approve?" 

Ignoring the question, Matthew ordered, "Sit. Sit on the couch and spread your legs for me. I want to see you." 

Helen complied again and shamelessly, wholly unselfconscious, parted her thighs. Helen was proud to show him her body. She wanted to see his expression while he worshiped her with his eyes. The look of hunger, that desperate hunger sent an arterial burst of renewed lust through her body. Helen slid her middle finger into her mouth, wetting the digit with saliva before sliding it through the folds of her sex. 

For a fleeting moment, a silent dove's wing of memory, Bobby's face arced across Helen's consciousness. "Bobby," she murmured. 

Too late; she was already lost. 

"I'm hot, Matthew," she whispered. "So, so hot, and so wet..." Matthew moved and stood between her feet before dropping to his knees. He pushed Helen's thighs wider apart, and then, with another growl at the sight of her protruding labia, took a slow, lascivious lick. He heard Helen's sigh as he lapped at her body. She groaned when he took several experimental dabs at her clitoris, the pink nub slick with Helen's own juice and his saliva. The woman quivered and grunted when Matthew sucked gently at the engorged bud. "Yes," she sighed. "That's lovely. Lick me, darling. Lick me... Suck me..." 

*** 

Damn she's exquisite. I adore her big tits. That pussy is so slippery. I'm so close to owning her; so near to controlling her. I must resist the urge to fuck her. Too soon and it will be incomplete. This one is so exquisite nothing less than total ruin will do. The end will be more satisfying if I control myself now. 

Oh, but she's so tempting. 

*** 

The arousal slid from her body as Helen writhed and groaned.. A trickle burst to a torrent as Matthew tongued and fingered her sex. Eventually, with two of his fingers squirming insistently inside her, Helen's climax squirted viscous juice over Matthew's hand and forearm. She grunted and groaned in the ecstasy of her orgasm, and sighed into her lover's mouth as they kissed; his fingers still busy inside her body. 

"Oh fuck," Helen grunted. "I thought I'd peed. God, that was so lovely." Her breasts trembled and swayed as she fought to breathe. "I want you now," she moaned. "Condoms... Have you..? Please, put it into me. I want you so badly..." 

"Not yet," Matthew shook his head. "I'm going to make you wait. I want you to crave me." 

"But I do want you," Helen blurted. "I'm so desperate." 

Helen, normally so controlled, had never before begged for sex. With Bobby, it had always been good, but the heat and passion had long since cooled to a soft familiarity. She loved her husband, but the need for release had never been as urgent as it was now. Even in the days of their courtship Helen had never desired Bobby with such intensity. 

"Would you like to suck my cock, Helen?" 

Her tone was eager. "Yes, yes I would." 

"Beg me," Matthew ordered and waved his length from side to side. "Plead, or I'll wank it instead." 

"Please," Helen whispered. "Please let me. Please, I want to taste you, I want to taste your cock. I want to taste your cock and have you fuck me." Helen's expression was one of shock at what was for her, depraved language. "What have you done to me?" she asked. "I've never behaved this way before. I've never been so infamed." 

"More," Matthew grunted. "Beg... Beg properly. I don't care what you haven't done before; it's what you're doing now that's important." 

"Matthew..." Helen murmured. Oh God," she capitulated, "I'll do anything if you let me suck you." Helen's finger's moved in slow circles through her sodden pubic bush as she massaged herself. "Anything, I'll do anything you ask if you let me taste you. You can use me... You can use me any way you want... Anything you want to do, I'll do it." 

Matthew laughed. It was a low, sinister sound. "Good, that's all good. Now, come to me and suck me. Suck my cock. Crawl to me on your knees to get to me and then eat my cock." 

*** 

She's as good as I'd hoped; better than I'd hoped. Just look at her now; her lips tight around my girth. She's trying so hard to please me. What a contrast to the cool, controlled woman I first saw. Look at her now, fingering herself desperately while she slurps and slobbers over my meat. Not an hour ago she was merely enjoying a social drink, and now... Ah, that's so sweet my lovely cocksucker. I'm going to savour that first time I slide into you. I'm going to use you thoroughly and pump you full of my seed. I'll have the essence of you, my dear; I'll take the marrow from your being...  

===

Oh, and poor Bobby. Of course I'll have to show Bobby how filthy his wife has become. I'll have to show him how she begged. Eventually of course; not too soon; I want to enjoy her, to have my fill. Then Bobby can have her back, if he wants her by then, although I doubt he will. 

*** 

"Tell me what you're doing, Helen. Describe what you're doing." 

"Pleasing you, Matthew, I'm pleasing you with my mouth." 

"No you're not," he scoffed." Pleasing me? You're not pleasing me. This isn't the Victorian era, you uptight bitch" Matthew gripped a fistful of Helen's hair, twisting it viciously. He grinned at Helen's wince. "What you're doing is sucking my cock. Tell me, tell me what you're doing. I want to hear the words. Tell me how much you enjoy gagging on my meat" 

Matthew tossed Helen's head aside in a gesture of contempt. The woman's eyes were moist with her tears. She gulped and choked back her sobs; she gulped air into her lungs, and then complied. "I'm sucking your cock you vicious bastard. Is that what you want to hear? Am I coarse enough? I'm sucking your cock; slurping, licking, and loving it. I want to eat your cock; I want to drink your come." 

"Not nearly coarse enough," Matthew snarled, "but I'll soon have you trained. You'll soon be dripping with depravity." He gripped Helen's hair again and challenged her with his stare. "You'll be begging for me to fuck your sodden cunt. You'll be grovelling for me to ravage your arsehole, but for now just suck me. Suck me and take my load on your face." 

"Matthew... Oh God, Matthew. That's so vulgar, so nasty and vulgar... It excites me; that filthy language is so arousing. I'll say those things for you. I want you to fuck me. I want you to use my... my..." Helen struggled with the word before, eventually, it dropped from her mouth. "I want you to use my cunt." Her face crumpled into a rictus of lust as Helen fingered herself to a climax. "I'm coming," she sobbed before her mouth hung slack and her orgasm rippled through her body. 

Matthew took his cock in hand and tugged at it with ferocious strokes while Helen's climax finally tapered. He gave a great grunt at the first of several vehement spurts of semen. A gout of the stuff spattered against Helen's face, with further drops of ooze splatting in generous dollops over the upper slopes of her breasts. Helen exclaimed in delight when she felt the shower raining down onto her skin. Cords of come clung to Helen's hair, thick and tenacious, while her skin shone with splashes of the sticky residue. Helen moaned before taking the head of Matthew's cock into her mouth and swallowed the final teardrop. Matthew looked down and smiled when he saw Helen sucking; her cheeks concave with effort; her eyes aflame with excitement, and her pretty features smeared with goo. 

Helen grinned as, finally, she let Matthew's penis drop from her lips. "I didn't know I could behave like that," she whispered, both appalled and thrilled by what she had just taken part in. "I still need to fuck, Matthew," she suggested. 

"Not tonight," he shook his head. "I want you to come back another night; sometime soon when we can spend more time together. I want it to be perfect." 

*** 

Time to send my whore home to her husband. Perhaps he can satisfy her? I doubt it though. Not now. Now she's beyond redemption; tainted with the stench of me. How very delightful.

Thank you for the positive response to the first chapter, ergo, as threatened, here's the second. Thank you to those who made suggestions and were actively involved in the creative - *snerk* creative? - process. You know who you are, UKOD, and there was even encouragement from the USA for which I am grateful. Right, before I get all emotional like a celeb at the Oscars I'm outta here. Enjoy, I hope. 

* 

As the weeks before Christmas passed, accelerating towards the feast of gluttony and excess with a fanfare of commercial enterprise that amazed me, Helen fell truly within my grasp. My mind held hers fast; she was my slave. On the occasions I allowed her to visit I resisted penetrating her; it was only when she was completely despoiled that I would take her. Despite her having sunk so far into the mire there were still unplumbed depths for my sweet Helen. Of course she protested at my refusal to fuck her, but I found the tears and the begging, so humiliating for her, all part of the fun. 

What kind of man am I? You may ask that question and would probably label me a monster -- which wouldn't be far from the truth. For a man I am not. I choose to exist among you but I am a creature of the ether. I'm not alone in the universe; there are others, many others, of my kind. But among those of my ilk I'm rather special. For while those entities, those lesser demons, probe blindly through the upper air like earthworms in wet soil, I am in a higher place. I'm self-aware, reasoning, intelligent, but still forced to live according to my nature. I need sustenance just as you, but my food is suffering; suffering and evil. 

You'll find my kind drifting amongst the onlookers at the scene of an accident. Ghoulish ravens, invisible to your eye amidst the mourners around an open grave, with more skulking in hospital wards, although I find hospitals are tainted with hope and love amidst the fear -- a terrible thing for me since hope and love weaken me. Wherever there's suffering one of us will be watching. If you sense us amongst the mayhem, I tell you now, turn and go and don't look back. For if that thing notices you -- even being incapable of reason -- the instinct is strong and it will latch onto you like the leech it so closely resembles. And then your life will be over. 

We aren't Death I hasten to add, although we do engineer her visits -- oh yes, Death is female; she's exquisitely beautiful but completely heartless. As cold and unfeeling as the moon, hers is a duty, a calling, and no amount of pleading, tears, anger or rage will deter Death when she turns that face towards you. Age, sex, race, whether you've been good or bad -- according to your scale -- it's all the same to Death. 

I'm sustained by suffering. If I don't feed every two years, perhaps three, my force would be so diminished I doubt I could recover. I find that perversion and its consequences add a piquant sauce to my dish. It's an unusual taste for one such as me -- I did mention I was special -- I appear to have developed a penchant for a certain quality of woman; attractive women, one whose slide into corruption nourishes my dark soul. 

*** 

Helen arrived early; she was eager to see him. She braced herself and prepared to brave the cold. Dark for less than half an hour, the bitter conditions had laid a layer of rime on the cars surrounding hers. She took a deep breath, partly in anticipation of the chill, but also to calm her nerves. She knew what to expect; Matthew had been very clear on the events she was shortly to be party to. 

"Two," he'd said. "There'll be two, plus me and the camera. I'm going to film you, Helen. I'm going to film you and then you're going to sit and watch the results. Right there in that room, immediately after you've been used. I want you stained and filthy while you watch, with their semen drying on your body; oozing from your cunt." 

The scene he described melted Helen's sex. She felt the trickle between her thighs even as the phone fell silent in her hand. Matthew had given her the hotel address, the time and date; there was no question she'd take part. 

What have I become? My God, he owns me. I'm his to control. Why do I crave him so much? 

Bundled inside her coat and with her breath showing in little puffs as she walked, Helen hurried past the cars seemingly huddled together like some kind of prehistoric creatures sheltering against the cold under their veneer of frost. 

"Good afternoon," the woman behind the desk smiled with professional courtesy and disinterested eyes. "Checking in?" 

"My..." Helen paused. How could she describe him? The woman remained impassive as Helen felt the heat rise in her face. "My friend," she blurted. "He's already here; he should be in the bar." 

"Certainly, madam," the receptionist acknowledged. "The bar is that way." 

Helen followed the direction of the pointing finger, missing the smirk on the other woman's face. "Friend my arse," the woman muttered, shaking her head before dismissing what was to her an everyday occurrence in the hotel. 

Helen paused before fully entering. From the door she could see the short side of an L-shaped room. Two girls were in harassed attendance behind the bar; serving drinks to a collection of van drivers, salesmen, transient construction workers, and other itinerant folk whose livelihood took them away from home. The bar was noisy with its predominantly male clientele and Helen expected to be examined and studied, an object of curiosity, too well-dressed for her surroundings. 

Under normal circumstance Helen would have baulked at that point; in fact, this hotel was of a kind far beneath her usual tastes. Such was the power of Matthew's influence that Helen's previous attitudes no longer counted, for now she was about to embark on the most sordid adventure of her life. Early on, shortly after meeting Matthew, Helen had been ripped by feelings of guilt and shame over her betrayal of her husband, Bobby, however Matthew's power over her now meant that taking this step further into the mire invoked only feelings of excited anticipation; guilt was redundant emotion. Helen was so eager to please Matthew she would do anything for him, and that included fucking two strange men while being filmed, as well as being unconcerned by the hungry looks of the oafish gaggle. 

Matthew turned in his seat to face Helen. She saw him turn and gasped, thinking: How did he know I was here? Shrugging off the thought walking into the hubbub she felt the slide of arousal at the sight of him, accompanied by a flutter of deep, warm anticipation and a sinking feeling in her guts, indistinguishable between excitement and dread. 

Matthew walked casually to the bar and seemingly without effort, despite others waiting their turn to be served, drew the attention of the barmaid. Helen couldn't hear his words as she approached but simply waited behind Matthew while the drinks were poured. 

Without speaking Matthew handed Helen a glass and then, returned to his table. It was simply expected that she'd follow. 

"So," he said eventually, "are you ready?" 

Helen sipped at her drink and grimaced. "Jesus, how strong is this?" 

Matthew laughed and replied, "It's a double. Dutch courage -- not that you'll need it, Helen, I'm sure." He leaned in, "Are you ready?" he repeated. "Are you ready to be fucked?" Matthew was satisfied to see Helen swallow heavily. 

"Oh, Matthew; I'm ready. I'll do it for you, anything for you." 

"Of that I have no doubt, my dear." He reached out a hand and pushed his fingers under the hem of Helen's dress, squeezing the bare skin of her thigh above her stocking top. For Helen the touch of his fingers against her flesh caused a tingle of excitement to ripple through her body, the epicentre of which was her juicing sex. She shivered and her thighs parted in an unconscious response. "And soon," Matthew continued," I'll fuck you too, Helen. I'll fuck you as you've begged me to. Would that be good for you?" 

"God, Matthew," she sighed, "That would... I..." 

"But before I have you," Matthew interrupted, "there's today's fun to be had." 

Ten minutes later Helen followed Matthew along the anonymous corridor. When he inserted the card that acted as a key into its slot Helen swayed and fell against the wall. Her legs felt weak and incapable of supporting her. She experienced a final, feeble stab of remorse at her betrayal of Bobby as Matthew pushed into the room and, as the thought of her faithful husband melted, Helen followed unsteadily. 

There were two men -- as expected -- waiting with casual insouciance. Despite knowing the men would be there their presence shocked Helen enough to gasp at the sight of them. The black man, well-muscled, shaven-headed and confident, grinned at the sound of Helen's sharp intake of breath. 

"Did we scare ya, honey?" he asked unfolding his arms and grinning in a dangerous way. "We don't mean no harm." 

"Helen, may I introduce Clayton," Matthew waved his arm in a flamboyant gesture towards the man. "Clayton, this is Helen, the lady I told you about." 

"You weren't kidding, man," Clayton nodded approvingly. "She's an oldie but goodie alright." 

Recovering slowly Helen dimly noticed the man's accent, American, she thought, American or Canadian. 

"And this is Fran√ßois," Matthew added indicating the second man. 

Helen glanced at Fran√ßois. Unusual name, she mused, possibly French? and then noticed the elaborate tattoo that adorned his arm from wrist to the cuff of his tee-shirt. He too was finely muscled, smiling at Helen with a predatory glint in his eyes. 

"Are we gettin' down to business?" Clayton suggested. "I can't wait to get missy all naked and sucking my cock." 

"Impatient, eh, Clayton?" Matthew grinned. "She's all yours boys. I'll just set the lights and take control of the camera. Use her and abuse her. She loves it." 

While Matthew concentrated on the lighting and equipment, Clayton moved around the bed. "Come here, baby," he crooned. "Come and get some of this." He unzipped and unbuttoned his jeans, pulling them open and grinning when the length of his cock flopped into view. "Ever had a black cock before?" 

Helen's eyes widened when she saw the terrible length and girth. It was bigger than any cock she'd ever experienced, or even seen. 

"Hey," Fran√ßois interjected in his accented English. "Just because he is black doesn't mean he has the biggest cock." He too unzipped his flies and revealed his own long, thick, penis. "I think you should suck me first. Come here, baby, come and suck this big fucking cock." 

He is French. The thought was irrelevant, Helen wouldn't and couldn't refuse this man whatever his nationality; she was powerless to refuse either one such was Matthew's influence. She glanced at Matthew, who gave a slight nod, and Helen abandoned all control. 

"She's all yours, Fran√ßois," Clayton graciously acknowledged. "Let her suck your cock first. I'll watch the show and then give Miss Big Tits here a slice of the ol' Clayton tongue. I'll make her squeal on my face before I give her the pleasure of the ol' black snake. Would you like that, honey? Would you like Clayton to lick that hot, pink pussy of your'n?" 

The men spoke and acted as though Helen had no mind of her own, which at that moment was close to the truth. She was mesmerised by the size of the men's appendages, both men of course chosen especially for their endowment. Clayton turned Helen around, slid her coat from her shoulders, and whistled in appreciation when he saw her figure hugging dress. 

"She sure has the big titties, eh?" Fran√ßois concurred. "Maybe we should see them, no?" 

"Come here," Clayton cajoled. "Come here and let me help you with that dress." He reached forward and pulled the zip that held the dress at Helen's neck. When the garment was loosened enough Clayton pulled and Helen wriggled. "Yeah, baby," Clayton grinned when Helen's breasts fell free. "Damn but they's big titties." Helen continued to slide the dress down over her hips, allowing it to fall in a heap at her feet before stepping out from the folds. "Ain't she sure put together well, Franky boy? Damn we got ourselves a hot-bodied cougar here." 

Matthew, camera in hand, moved in close to capture the moment of Helen's revelation. The image in the viewfinder showed Clayton fondling Helen's breasts, his dark skin in shocking contrast to hers. Clayton kissed Helen, pushing his tongue roughly into her mouth while his fingers continued to knead and massage her flesh. It took a moment for Helen to respond to the kiss, but soon her tongue rolled around and around with ardour inside Clayton's mouth. 

As they kissed, Helen's fingers curled around the shaft of Clayton's cock. Immediately it thickened and grew as the man grew aroused. 

"God it's so... So thick," Helen whispered in awe. 

Naked now Fran√ßois moved forward, having undressed hurriedly during Clayton and Helen's kiss. "Feel this one also. This one is also thick. Can you get your mouth around me, Madame?" 

Turning at the touch of his hand on her shoulder, Helen faced Fran√ßois. She noticed the intricate tattoo extended not only the length of his left arm, but also adorned his torso, forming a complicated pattern from shoulder to his waist. Then her eyes fell to his engorged length and the tattoo was forgotten. "Fuck," Helen sighed. "It's huge. Both of you... Such huge cocks." 

Helen turned to comment to Matthew a moment later and, even in the midst of impiety she was taken aback by his expression. As he surveyed the scene, his camera in hand recording the events, Matthew's look was unguarded. Helen felt a shiver of unease ripple down her spine. For a moment she felt his malevolence; a portent of doom like a goose walking over her grave. It was a momentary phase, one which was quickly pushed from her mind when Clayton's voice interrupted her thoughts. 

"Suck him, bitch," Clayton ordered as he began to divest himself of his restrictive clothing. "Get on your knees and suck it." 

Like a supplicant, Helen knelt, a slight residue of unease staining her consciousness which rapidly faded to nothing as she confronted the terrible thing in front of her. Fran√ßois grinned down at the woman as, slowly, she took his shaft in hand and, her eyes wide, examined the brutal cock. After a short time she shook her head as though waking and realising what was expected of her. 

Matthew captured the spectacle, focussing upon Helen's lips stretched tight around the man's girth as she opened her mouth wide to take the bulbous cock- head between her lips. Helen gagged as Fran√ßois forced his length into her mouth, letting the thing drop from her lips as she choked and retched. 

"She ain't used to a big ol' thing like that, Franky baby," Clayton chuckled. "You're gonna choke the bitch." 

"I will have to train her then." Fran√ßois pulled Helen's head back towards his cock as it waggled heavily."Like I train the French ladies back home, non? Lick it," he insisted. "Lick the tip like a lollipop." 

"That's a nasty sight," Clayton continued. "Big titty bitch on her knees suckin' cock. Damn but that's a bad thing to be seein'. He stroked his own length further into engorged anger. "I can't wait, Franky. Let her suck some of me too. C'mere, bitch, lick Clayton's pole." 

"Oh my God," Helen murmured when faced with the double assault. "I..." Her words were cut off as Clayton forced his meat against her face. She opened her mouth and attempted to take some of the offered length. Once again she gagged and spat, saliva dripping onto her breasts while cords of goo connected her face to Clayton's cock. "Too big..." she spluttered. "Too long, both of you; I can't take you so deep." 

"Lay on the bed; open your legs; I wanna taste your hot, juicy pussy." Clayton lifted Helen to her feet by one arm and flung her onto the bed. "Come on, bitch," he ordered roughly. "Hurry up and show me some pink." 

Helen rolled onto her back and allowed her thighs to fall open. She saw both men's eyes glint with interest at her smooth, newly shaven mound. Peeling her labia apart in a shamelessly lascivious act, she offered her bubbling centre to the men. "Lick me," she begged. "Lick my cunt" -- she knew the use of the word would please Matthew -- "I'm so hot and wet. One of you, hurry and lick me." 

"I'd be happy to," Clayton grinned. "Sweet, white-girl pussy; I'm gonna enjoy this." 

"Yes." Helen cried in rapture when Clayton tongued at her opening. "I can feel your hot breath on my body, it's so exciting. Curl that talented tongue inside me, you black fucker," she groaned, "lick me till I come." 

Clayton tongued and slurped at Helen while Matthew filmed and Fran√ßois massaged her breasts, his cock inches from her face. 

"Suck me again," he grunted, pushing his penis toward Helen. A smear of pre- come stained her cheek as she turned her head to facilitate Fran√ßois request. Her grunts of pleasure were muffled as Fran√ßois forced his penis into Helen's mouth, this time mindful not to choke her. "That's the way, baby," Fran√ßois hissed in approval as Helen's tongue swirled around his cock head. "Suck my cock, that's it; lick it just like that... Ah, that's so good." 

"Oh shit," Helen grunted. "Stop licking me... Please... Fuck me now. Put it in me now and I'll come." Her breath came in pants, her face was flushed, and her eyes bright. "Put it in me Clayton I'm begging you. Put it in me and fuck." 

"Anything you say." Clayton knelt between Helen's thighs and rubbed the head of his cock against her labia and clitoris. He moved the thing up and down, splitting the sticky folds before finally nudging into Helen's opening. 

"Oh God," Helen's eyes widened as inch after slow inch invaded her body. "It's stretching me," she squealed, squirming on the bed. "It's filling me... Oh..." She swallowed heavily, eyes bulging wide as she looked along the front of her body and saw the dark shaft slowly disappearing. "Look at it going in," she grunted and then sighed when Clayton stopped for a moment only to pull back an inch or two. He eased further out of Helen's body, pausing before reversing direction and pushing back into Helen, this time going deeper than before. 

"Look at the sticky stuff on my dick," Clayton grunted as he again pulled his length nearly completely free of Helen. "The bitch is so horny she's gettin' all gooey on me. Damn but she's all hot for my black cock. You like that, honey? You like Clayton's big, black snake? Is it gonna make you yell and squirm?" "Yes, you glorious bastard," Helen groaned. The tendons in her neck and throat were as sharp as a knife edge as she grimaced in ecstasy. "Come on, you big fucker," she continued through gritted teeth. "Move that thing in and out. Fuck me with it." 

Her urgency and desperation for climax was evident in the way Helen thrust her hips up to meet Clayton's own downward force. Her nails clawed down along the man's back and sides as she desperately tried to pull more of him into her body. As she strove for release Helen's eyes met Matthew's. Suddenly an independent thought burst and Helen stared with haughty disdain at Matthew. Her eyes glinted in challenge; sparks from a forge, but, alas for her it was a confrontation instantly defeated by the man's intense look in response.

Test me would you, bitch? Do you think I care about them fucking you? I care less for their rutting; their grunting sweating bodies invading your own delicious form. I have no real taste for the physical release of your sex; it's the despoiling of you that nourishes me. Let your brief pleasure wash over you. Let them take their fill of your cunt, and you in return have your fill of them. Drain them of their seed. Concentrate on your own needs, my harlot, come on his cock and put on a superb show for the lens. This recording will be the currency by which I buy my supper.

Helen, realising she had displeased him reacted to Matthew's look by instantly breaking contact, redoubling her efforts against Clayton's pounding rhythm. Clayton, mistaking Helen's efforts at placating Matthew, took this as proof of his own prowess and concentrated his efforts by slamming harder against Helen's body, hammering at her mound with merciless vigour. 

"You want me to tear your pussy up, huh, bitch? You want ol' Clayton to bang you rough?" 

Deaf to his words Helen felt the surge of her climax build and rush through her body in an inescapable tide. She glanced at Matthew again and saw a pleased expression on his face. Relieved and reassured by the sight, Helen gave a cry of joy and allowed her mind to fall into the abyss. She groaned and sighed in ecstasy while the juice oozed from her in a steady trickle, coating Clayton's shaft and dribbling over his swinging balls while Clayton forced his way deeper and harder into her body. Finally, crying louder, Helen rode the crest of the orgasmic wave. 

As Helen writhed and groaned, Clayton withdrew his length and its coating of mixed juices. Fran√ßois took up position with indecent, eager haste, hauling Helen with neither ceremony nor care onto her front. He then dragged her into position on all fours and then, with Helen's derriere raised, he probed at her until the tip of his penis found the place. With a groan from Fran√ßois and an accompanying sigh of pleasure from Helen, he finally slid into the woman's accommodating body. 

"Another fat cock," Helen purred, falling forward her breasts squashing into the bed. "Fuck me as hard as he did," She implored, her voice muffled as a result of her face pressing into the bed. "Fuck me like that glorious bastard just did." Another glance at Matthew, this one rather awkward, for approbation was met with a silent smirk of approval. "I'm wet and I feel the need for fucking," she added, desperate for Matthew's continued good grace. 

"Go on, Franky," Clayton urged. "You do the old bitch good." He took a handful of Helen's hair and lifted her level with his penis. Helen studied the shaft waggling near her face and noticed how slick and shiny it was. 

"Is that me on your cock?" Helen's head began to jerk in time with the thrusting, grunting Fran√ßois as his tight belly slapped against her buttocks."Is that my come?" 

"It sure is, baby; you wanna taste it? You wanna taste your cream on my cock?" Without waiting for a response Clayton forced himself between Helen's lips. The woman needed no urging and opened her mouth to accept the offering. "Damn but you're a slutty old bitch. Just lookit you licking my dick. It's been awhile since I've see'd one as nasty as you."

Poor Clayton has no way of knowing but Helen will be his last woman. In a few more minutes, as I instructed earlier, he will masturbate and spray his life's final ejaculate against Helen's breasts. Then, later, as he leaves a pub in Whitechapel, he will be the victim of an assault that will see him stabbed and bleeding in the road while late night revellers ignore his pleas for help. An ambulance will arrive in due course, but it'll be too late for the American; his life will have leaked away onto the cold ground of London, so far from his homeland. 

Both men, both Clayton and Fran√ßois, have been sensed by others of my kind; the dull ones were alerted by my proximity. But just because my distant cousins are brainless, that doesn't make them any less dangerous, and I'm content to allow them this feed like hyenas at the Lion's kill. The one hovering near Clayton now -- and to me it's as visible as the man's ridiculous cock -- has its own plan for him; his fate is sealed, and Clayton will be kissing the cold, harsh lips of Death before tomorrow's sun dawns. 

Fran√ßois? He's revelling in his rutting; he's fucking Helen like a man possessed, which in a few moments he will be. He too will never see another day. He's fated to be electrocuted on the Piccadilly line. An unfortunate accident of course, but the demon waiting for him will relish the gawping crowd that gathers to see his smouldering corpse. It will feed well on their shock and fear. Poor Fran√ßois, he doesn't know it but he's leaving Helen a little gift -- a nasty, virulent dose of gonorrhoea. A little twist of my own I think Bobby will appreciate. 

*** 

"Ah... Merde... I'm going to come. I can't help..." Fran√ßois gripped Helen's hips and pushed into her as his filthy seed spurted deep. 

"I can feel you doing it," Helen wailed, not knowing that the man's semen was tainted with infection. "I can feel the stuff pissing into me... I'm coming too. I'm coming again!" 

Fran√ßois released Helen's hips and reached under her body to cup her heavy breasts in his palms. He continued to rut into the woman as he kneaded and mauled at her tits. 

"So sexy," he sighed, "so fucking sexy. Such big tits, they excite me. And your cunt... It is made for fucking." 

Fran√ßois eventually released Helen's breasts. The soft flesh was marked with red blotches where Fran√ßois had mauled at her body and there were similar signs of his grasping fingers on her hips. Helen fell forward on the bed in a panting heap while Fran√ßois wiped the perspiration from his brow. His penis remained semi-erect, with drops of polluted spunk dripping onto the rumpled quilt. 

A few minutes later both men had departed, but not before they had both played to the camera and, as per Matthew's instructions, flung a sheaf of banknotes at a now bedraggled and soiled Helen. 

"Thanks for the fuck," Fran√ßois had sneered. 

"Yeah, baby, you're one juicy slut with a hungry pussy," Clayton added, eyeing Helen's impressive breasts for a final time. "If'n you want some more action you come find me. I'm sure I can get a few more fellahs together and really give you a good time." 

The door closed and the pair walked towards their respective fates. In the room Matthew quickly organised the equipment so Helen, still naked, leaking come, and with Clayton's goo cooling and drying on her breasts, could relive the outrageous scene. 

"Was I good enough, Matthew? Did I please you?" Helen's expression turned downcast. "I'm sorry about..." 

"No matter, Helen," his tone was curt. "Don't ever challenge me again or I'll leave you." 

The bluff was successful: "Oh no, Matthew, please! Don't say that. I couldn't bear it if you weren't in my life." 

*** 

Helen really had no clue as to why her addiction to the destructive force of Matthew was so strong. She had no reason, for there was no rational explanation for his hold over her, to crave his presence so desperately. All Helen knew was her overwhelming desire was to have Matthew close by; his manipulative, destructive force only rarely impinged on the possessed woman's psyche, and on the infrequent occasions that a hint of Matthew's true nature slithered across her conscious thoughts he somehow sensed the danger and exerted his own peculiar brand of manipulation. Helen was a bee encased in amber; a prisoner, captive until Matthew had finally finished with her. Only then would her mind be free, but the question remained, what would that freedom bring?
