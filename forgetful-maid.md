 ****** Forgetful Maid ****** byStoryTeller07© It was Helen's turn to drive to the party and she was telling him about several weeks of hypnotherapy that helped her stop smoking. It had been a complete cure and thought he would be pleased. It had been a mistake telling her husband though. 

 Nigel became angry seeing it as deceit. He thought it was a deceit but it certainly wasn't her opinion of the situation. It was just his pride that had been dented. He already resented her position as managing director of her late fathers company and this revelation was yet another slight to his pride. 

 She had grown up with a powerful father and still felt a man should make the decisions but that didn't happen between them. In his opinion he was a natural leader but he wasn't tough, or at least as ruthless as her father. 

 Helen wasn't looking forward to his company's gathering. It was a large international corporation with too many self important pompous people on its staff. Not only that, he had been spending all hours working at gaining a promotion until she felt neglected. 

 Why didn't they stay home and spend some time together? She knew the answer to that before it was asked. He needed to be there to mingle and be seen as a company man. He wanted promotion to prove something to her. 

 Perhaps that's why she revealed the little secret on the drive to the party, knowing it would annoy him. She was twenty-nine and attractive so why did she have to make so much effort to attract him? He was seven years older than her and was taking an attractive young wife for granted. 

 In an attempt to placate him she suggested he could trigger the hypnosis tonight after the party. All he had to do was say the phrase and she would be his to command. It was said partly to appease him but mostly to regain his interest. 

 Saying it with a saucy wink she thought to bring him out of the fractious mood. Taking his silence for approval of the idea she assumed he was thinking it through so gave him some encouragement. 

 She quietly mentioned it would be possible for her to leave off inhibitions and so do what ever he wanted. She told him the phrase mistakenly thinking he too had a naughty image of them together in the bedroom. 

 As the words left her lips she began to feel a flutter within at the idea of him using her in the bedroom for his own gratification. He could use her to fulfil his fantasies while she was under his complete control. The thought left her with a buzz of excitement. 

 Nigel had been thinking about her state of weakness but not in the same way she had. "You fool, are you a complete idiot? Why did you let some stranger hypnotise you?" He seethed, trying not to shout but the anger was plainly there. His fists were clenched tight and he was almost shaking with anger. 

 At the front door of the party he was in danger of being discovered ranting like a maniac. The door opened and he forced a smile at the maid. 

 *** 

 She was in no mood to make small talk with his colleagues who were neither friends, nor shared anything in common to become friends. Despite having a wealthy father she hadn't gained the confidence to attend such functions. Rather the strategy was to hide away in a corner avoiding everyone. 

 Toward the end of the evening the boss decided everyone had to take a turn at providing the entertainment. One tiresome individual recited poetry while others warbled a song or danced or cracked corny jokes. Nigel's party piece however was well received. 

 He whispered into Helen's ear taking her by complete surprise, leaving her standing in a state of deep suggestion. At first everyone thought it a joke so he had to push a little further until they became impressed with his power over her. 

 They laughed when she waddled around like a penguin and barked like a dog on all fours. They cheered when she juggled oranges almost making it to four in the air at once. For the finale they whooped when she raised her dress to become a Parisian Can-Can dancer. 

 He thought it a laugh to see her performing silly pranks and asked someone in the small audience to suggest tricks for his victim to perform. At least this gentle humiliation had mollified him, putting him in a genial mood, as getting his own way always did. 

 'If my employees saw me like this I'd die of embarrassment.' She thought. 

 *** 

 Returning a drink from the bar Helen noticed a woman she knew from the company's last Christmas party. She remembered the two of them had danced rather close and it was all so obvious, yet he was too stupid to notice, she was after him. She was laughing at his lame jokes, flashing her eyes every time he looked into them and the hussy was pointing her breasts at him. 

 She summed up the situation in the short time it took to squeeze through the crowd with his drink. Helen handed it to him and stood patiently waiting. When they arrived home Helen would make her husbands life hell. Listening to the braying laugh she thought perhaps he knew it too. It sounded hollow as though he weren't enjoying the party as much as he pretended. 

 *** 

 "You two put on a good show! Where did you learn to dance like that?" The woman asked. 

 Helen took offence at the imperious tone as though such an act was beneath the woman. She remembered her name now, Margo that was it. 

 Helen just stood there placidly ignoring her. 

 "Have I said something wrong?"Margo asked. 

 "She's still hypnotised." He said, breaking the stony silence. 

 "So you really did hypnotise her, how impressive Nigel. Can I order her to do something? Will she fetch me a drink?" She gushed. 

 "Of course she will." He beamed a silly grin. 

 The stupid man, she just wants me out of the way. At least I don't have to make inane small talk with this witch. 

 "Hang on a moment though I need to speak to William, I won't be long will you look after her till I get back? Helen you will obey Margo. So be a good girl and do as you're told." He commanded with authority, trying to impress the stuck-up witch. 

 Helen was astonished at his callous behaviour. Being handed over to this flirty woman's care like a feeble pet was demeaning and she felt humiliated at being abandoned. If they ever owned a pet dog she would never put it into kennels after this. 

 Margo turned to her flashing a bland smile unsure of what to do with her. They stood there in silence surrounded by the buzz of conversation. Helen just hoped the woman didn't take advantage of her vulnerable state. The last thing she wanted was this bitch making a fool of her. 

 "Hi Margo, it's unlike you not to be with someone." Roger smiled and winked at Helen. 

 Helen recognised him immediately he was her husbands rival for the position of Global Accounts director. He obviously missed the show as he didn't recognise her. Margo gave him an exaggerated look of boredom. 

 "You should swap sides and join my campaign for the job and dump that loser. I'll make you my personal assistant." He said. Gaining nothing he turned to Helen. "Who's this beauty then?" He asked, with another saucy wink. 

 "This is Nigel's wife." Margo said, with a smirk. It was probably the first sign of a genuine emotion all evening. 

 He stuttered an apology telling her he was joking. 

 "Don't worry Roger darling she is hypnotised and won't remember a thing. You can say what you like." Margo said. 

 Breathing deeply Helen calmed herself. Keen to carry on in this state she told herself to listen and obey. It was repeated as a mantra pushing her into a deeper trance. With any luck she might learn some interesting little secrets while they thought she would be unable to remember what they said. 

 "What do you mean? Oh I heard about that, Nigel put on a bit of a show." He said. 

 "In fact you can do me a favour. Take her for a dance and keep her out of the way for a bit. Will you? If you help me out here I might help you in return. I'm not interested in him winning a place on the board. I could comfort him when he loses. I don't mind being a consolation prize." She said, laughing at Rogers's shocked expression. 

 She turned to Helen and said. "Obey Roger. You will have a good time with him I'm sure. Go on, do as you're told." 

 *** 

 Roger told her to dance close and she did just that. On the crowded dance floor he gripped her bottom without being noticed, not that any one would care when the drinks had flowed so freely all evening. 

 He watched her husband return to Margo and chuckled. It was immensely amusing to be holding the wife's bottom in both hands while Margo attempted to seduce poor Nigel. 

 He looked through the crowd at Nigel looking around for his wife so Roger guided their steps to the opposite edge of the dance floor. A fast number came on so he took her hand to wend their way through the gyrating bodies. 

 He took a key out of his jacket pocket. "Helen, take this and go to room one- eleven. I want you out of the way for a little while. You can surprise them at it if all goes well." 

 His smirk was bad enough for her to have some sympathy for her husband. Despite the possibility he was going to be getting into bed with that woman she thought it unfair he should be caught by his rival jeopardising that job he craved for. If she was used in the trap it would be diabolical. 

 Sitting on the edge of the bed she wondered what was going on; had her husband been seduced by Margo? It was so frustrating sitting there not knowing what was going on. 

 The door opened on the plush hotel room and in walked Roger. "Let's have a good look at you then. Pull down the top of that dress." He told her, while leering at the deep cleavage. 

 It was a surprise when her hands did exactly as ordered. It was a shock to see her large breasts spilled out into his hands. She had not realised how vulnerable she was, assuming there would have to be some resistance. Surely she wouldn't obey just anything he ordered. 

 In a state of confusion she watched his hands hold both breasts up for a kiss to each nipple in turn. He was making a meal of them obviously enjoying this late supper, sucking and licking her breasts. 

 In anguish she realised she both wanted to pull them out of his grasp and wanted to thrust them in his face. 

 He whispered in her ear. "Now you can drop that dress." 

 Both legs trembled threatening to bring her to her knees when the dress dropped around her ankles. She trembled from fear and lust combining into one feeling of overwhelming emotion. It was useless to resist yet it seemed wrong to be enjoying it so much. 

 She was in her panties letting a near stranger suck on her breasts and it was turning her on. Her body was sending orders to her head to give in and take it. She was trembling with excitement, feeling wonderful intense sensations, more than she had for such a long time; but that was no excuse. 

 His hand let go of a breast to be supported by a consuming suction from his mouth. The hand abandoned her breast for a more sensitive spot between her legs. He knew how to effectively fondle this too. He smoothly manipulated her while she obediently waited for the next instruction. 

 When a thought managed to crawl through the white haze of emotion that fogged her brain, she knew she was helpless regardless of hypnosis. She was helpless from the very start of that intense onslaught upon her senses. 

 As her legs gave way he guided her down. Had it been a whispered instruction or had her legs finally collapsed under her. 

 He fed her hunger with his penis in her mouth. She had never attempted such a task before, although there had been some frantic discussions once in awhile with her husband. 

 Told to lick and suck with gusto she did just that. The damn man was even skilful with instructions. With enthusiasm she sucked and nibbled upon his stout member, even licking his balls, which she thought must prove something as he hadn't ordered this delicacy. 

 She felt him about to cum. The sack in her hand stiffened and his cock grew a little more in her mouth. Her mind rebelled yet her movements became more frantic with lust. She gripped tight his penis with her lips and tongue then sucked him dry. 

 He lifted her onto the edge of the bed where she sat trembling. A little bit, just a small happening, was all she felt but it was an orgasm. She felt guilty and dirty. She knew his name but he was a stranger and she had committed this dreadful act betraying her husband. 

 She wanted to cry and shout and hit him but just sat there. Calming herself she grasped at straws telling her self, 'At least he didn't take her down there.' He was telling her something but didn't want to know blanking the words, the room and especially him. 

 It was all over so quickly it seemed like a dream, that it never happened. Perhaps that was a solution, to forget it, to push it out of mind. What had he told her? She couldn't remember and that suited her fine. She pulled the dress on and tidied herself up, straightened her hair then applied some make-up. 

 'What's that on my face? Damn! His cum dribbled onto my chin.' Disgusted at the thought of it she meant to wipe it away but couldn't. 'Damn the bastard! That must have been what he was ordering me to do. I can't wipe it away.' She wailed silently. 

 A wave of disgust threatened to overwhelm her as they left the room. He led her discreetly down the stairs back into the heaving mass of bodies on the dance floor. She lowered her face knowing that disgusting mess was sticking to her chin. 

 Heading toward her husband she cried inwardly at the shame of what was about to unfold. He stopped and turned to her and said. "Wipe the sperm off your face with a finger, onto your tongue but don't swallow it until I tell you." 

 Helen continued the walk of shame to stand beside her husband. Margo was talking business with him managing to turn it into a flirting session. They studiously ignored everything about them including Helen and Roger. 

 Obviously they had not made it to the bedroom though Margo looked as though this was still her intention. Helen wanted to drag him away from the witch and give him such a hard time he wouldn't dare speak to the witch but could only stand in silence. 

 That she was unable to react and Margo knew it was a distinct disadvantage. Margo kept giving her little sly glances as though to say, 'Just watch, learn and weep, sweety'. 

 Unknown to Margo her thoughts were far from chastising an errant husband, for all she could think about was her own betrayal. She stood there in that crowded room with another mans sperm in her mouth. She wanted to spit and scream. Waiting for permission to swallow it was adding insult to injury. 

 The taste was salty and unfamiliar. She had the smell of his manhood in her nostrils and wanted to heave at the memory of sucking it into her mouth. At least he didn't deep throat her. An ironic laugh that threatened to spill into hysteria had to be caught and dealt with. 

 The bastard had led her through the crowd back to her husband with a gob of his cum on her face. Making her wipe it onto her tongue was a revolting trick. The acrid salty taste was impossible to ignore. What the hell would Margo make of it if she found out? 

 'For pity's sake let me swallow your damn cum.' She whimpered. The very idea of begging a stranger to let her swallow his cum left her perilously close to breaking down. What could she do standing next to her husband? If she broke out of the hypnotic state she would surely react emotionally to this disgrace. 

 Trying to remain calm she repeated over and over that she must wait on Rogers command. 'Be calm and obey Roger.' She repeated to herself. 

 Her husband ignored Roger, asking. "Where have you been?" She couldn't speak properly with a string of sperm on her tongue and wondered what they would make of the lisp. Then it dawned on her she would have to tell them the truth. 

 At least he didn't ask what have you been up to, but she was about to tell them she had been to Roger's room and that would raise their eyebrows. It would certainly distract him from wondering why she was lisping. 

 Roger quickly interrupted. "I've been boring your wife with tales from my hobby Nigel, ornithology. The weather is so mild for this time of year, I think I saw summers first swallow." This last word he pronounced very clearly. 

 They both looked at him as though he were mad. Helen was so desperately grateful to at last swallow his despicable fluid she forgot to answer. Her husband forgot about asking again for the explanation was so unexpected. 

 "Good grief, a twitcher!" Nigel said. 

 *** 

 Roger steered the witch away with a firm grip on her elbow and the husband and wife stood, not unusually, quiet amongst the hubbub of voices. Both lost in their own thoughts she guessed his were about work and the strategy for winning the prized position of accounts director. 

 Helen wondered if she would ever be the same again. It was certainly an experience. Each time someone joined them she couldn't help being afraid her husband might leave her with them. 

 She spent the rest of the evening waiting for someone else to take advantage of this dreadful helpless state. What was most surprising was that it gave her a little thrill. To her relief Nigel led her over to their hosts and made his excuses. 

 While he fetched their coats she had a terrible feeling. For an awful moment she thought he had left her there. She started to imagine men taking her one by one to room one-eleven to perform some sordid act. 

 She wasn't very experienced or worldly wise but her imagination made up for it. Fortunately when he led her out to the car the chill night air covered the emotional shivering that overtook her. She had looked at complete strangers and felt them touching her and abusing her and had become excited. 

 Perhaps that appalling experience had changed her and she would never be able to forget it. A small naughty part of her didn't want to. 

 Once in the car he thought out how to bring her round. He didn't want to, knowing the trouble he was in, but had too much to drink to drive. He simply asked her what the procedure was. Although back to her normal self, as much as she ever would be, nothing was said on the drive home. 

 Helen was relieved he too had nothing to say. Pretending to remember nothing of the evening she was grateful he was not in the mood to try her out that evening. One more visit to the therapist was needed to have that damned password changed. 

 *** 

 Next morning Helen arose late from her bed but even after a long deep sleep she felt unable to think straight. In the kitchen she found a quickly scribbled note. 'I've been called into the office.' 

 "Another damn Saturday morning meeting!" She exclaimed. A feeling of loneliness swept over her. 

 She shuddered at the memory of prancing around hypnotised before his colleagues and determined to forget about it. She would take on a well practised therapy, shopping. 

 There didn't seem anything in the usual stores that took her fancy. Stopping for a coffee she was ready to give up. Thinking about last night a feeling of guilt overwhelmed her. Her husband had neglected her for months and when they finally went out together it had been to a damned business occasion. 

 He had humiliated her before them all then spent the rest of the evening flirting with Margo. Even though it was the other way round it had been unpleasant to watch. She vaguely remembered dancing with someone and that's when the guilt kicked in. 

 It hardly seemed fair but merely shrugged her shoulders, after all this was an excuse to shop. Helen decided to give him a treat after all. With a purpose resolved she strode out through the mall, a professional consumer. 

 A makeover would be just perfect, she deserved some pampering. Sitting with a lemon tea she discussed styles with the beautician. A wave of vagueness came over her once more but the young woman seemed to know what was required.  

 

 ****** Forgetful Maid ****** byStoryTeller07© The full treatment was a wise choice as she felt so relaxed. After a massage and a waxing she sat enjoying the attention, having her nails and hair attended to. She sat there blissfully unaware of the world around her letting them get on with it. 

 Her blond hair was being teased into something a bimbo would be proud of. The extensions to her nails were a little gaudy but they did suit the new look. Walking out she took a deep breath in an attempt to shift the absent-minded state she had fallen into after the luxurious pampering. 

 She usually kept her hair in check and would never wear such gaudy make up preferring a more mature look. This whole new image was untypical but she justified it as being a surprise for her husband. 

 A store she hadn't noticed before held promise. There was nothing on display in the window which indicated it was an expensive designer shop. Walking in she didn't notice much until right by a rack of what appeared to be sports wear. "Strange." She said. 'Who would wear a rubber diving suit designed like a dress?' She thought. 

 "Anything special or are you just browsing?" The assistant asked. 

 "I want a dress for my husband." She murmured when that muzzy feeling overcame her again. 

 "What size is he?" She asked. 

 'Where do they get these people?' She thought. "For me I meant." She always went for elegant and staid but was about to ask for something elegant and provocative instead. She remembered disappointing him last night and how he would have liked her to be his little wife at home. 

 "Do you have something feminine and girly?" She asked, not quiet sure what she meant. 

 "Are you sure it's not for him?" The woman sounded bored. 

 "Something he will like to see me in." She said, ignoring the flippant remark. 

 "You mean you want something sexy to wear for him." She said, at last being helpful. 

 "Exactly, but I'm not sure what." Helen agreed. 

 The woman raised her eyebrows in disbelief at yet another wife without a clue trying to spice up a marriage. They often came into this sex shop from the wealthy side of town, always with their noses in the air as though she were beneath them. 

 She looked at her from head to toe. The customer was wearing an elegant expensive two piece outfit that seemed incongruous with the make up and hair that looked rather slutty. 

 'What do I have that's feminine and expensive?' She pondered. "Walk this way I have something that looks the part." 

 'I'd need very high heels to walk that way.' Helen thought. 

 "This is popular." She said, trying to raise some enthusiasm for some stock that needed clearing. 

 Looking at a flouncy shepherdess outfit brought on a giggle. "I don't think so, but close. What's that? I like basic black." Helen pointed out something generating a little thrill that ran up her spine. 

 "A French Maid outfit, a good choice." The woman smiled. 'Very expensive too why didn't I think of that?' Instead she said. "A lot of wealthy women buy this little number. Try it on and see the effect, I guarantee he'll be drooling for you. It is just the right thing for a husband." She smiled. 

 "What do you think?" Helen asked. 

 "What can I say? It's made for you. Excuse the pun." She chortled which turned into an inelegant smokers cough. 

 Helen looked at herself in a mirror and turned this way and that. The bustier squeezed her waist and pushed the breasts up into a deep cleavage that the black silk dress struggled to contain. She felt as though leaning forward would spill them out. 

 The hem floated on layers of light taffeta which lifted and fell as she twirled. The tight suspenders clasped her thighs holding the sheer black stockings smooth as silk over a pair of shapely legs. 

 When she took a step in the high heels the dress bounced in waves showing off the tight white panties. The starched white apron, cap, and frills at her wrists set the ensemble off wonderfully. 

 She wondered about the leg garter thinking it might be a bit too much. 

 Although the panties fit tightly between her cheeks and pulled between her lips she preferred them. The thong and the cup were comfortable but didn't cover much. That's what the assistant called it, a cup. The description made sense for that's all it was; it merely cupped her sex in a fine piece of silk held in place by thin flesh coloured ribbons. 

 She would take them together with the black see-through panties and an even higher pair of heels. 

 The assistant looked her over with amusement. 'It's funny how this same outfit is purchased by men to wear.' She was even more amused totalling the bill. 

 "No need to wrap this I'll wear it home." Helen said. 

 "Your coat won't cover all those petticoats. May I suggest this cloak?" She asked, with dollar signs lighting her eyes. 

 It was from a naughty nurse outfit but would do to cover the silly woman. She had to admit it was quite a transformation, from staid housewife to sexy maid with a nice profit, all in just under an hour. 

 *** 

 Helen felt naughty and sexy and liberated. She decided to drop in on a friend who might be shocked but hoped she would share in the daring fun of it. 

 That fuzzy feeling was interfering with her sense of direction which wasn't all that difficult. Where was number twenty-five she seemed to have driven in the wrong end of the street so didn't recognise where she was. Pulling into the driveway a sense of fun and adventure gripped her. 

 With the doorbell fading away in the distance she looked at the highly polished oak door wondering if it had been changed as it didn't seem familiar. When it opened she took a deep breath and swept in swirling the cloak off her bare shoulders. 

 The entrance hall was decorated by someone with tasteful elegance. A strong male influence dominated the room with a leather wing back chair and sculptured art-deco nudes looked over by racehorse prints. 

 She was looking forward to visiting a woman friend but on seeing a man waiting for her the idea melted away. Looking at him holding her cloak something started to seep into memory like fog clearing to reveal a ravaged landscape. 

 'It's Roger, what is he doing here? Why am I visiting him?' She thought. 'I should leave immediately.' Her feet refused to obey instead they followed him further into the house. 

 A feeling of anxiety was building as to why she was there, it didn't seem right, though an inner voice told her she had arrived as planned. 

 It started to make sense although it sill felt wrong. Her hair had been re- styled and clothes purchased for a man, this man. The hypnosis entertainment of last night came to mind then the dance with him but just as the two ideas were connecting a fog clouded her thoughts. Did he have something to do with the shopping trip? Had he ordered her to visit him? 

 He looked intently at the beautiful woman standing so elegantly in the lounge. Her legs were most beautifully shaped by the pose she was forced into by wearing such high heels. The stockings were pulled tight by the garter belt. The black ribbons of the straps looked so tantalising against the white of her thighs. 

 The panties revealed the mound of her pussy and that it had been waxed. The halo of blonde hair surrounding her head looked magnificent. The bustier seemed to be straining under the load of large breasts without straps to support them. 

 What to do with her now he had her? Last night he had imagined what he would do with this attractive woman but the fantasies had evaporated like a mirage now she was here. Relax he told himself. She would wait patiently for anything he wanted, anything at all, just so long as he handled her right. 

 He sat down on the sofa looking up at his prize. It was so much more than he expected. From this angle her panties were clearly on show and he smiled at the swollen camel toe. "Those panties look uncomfortably tight did you bring anything else to wear?" He asked. 

 She delved into the shopping bag and brought out a range of panties bought, reluctantly holding them up to him for inspection. 'What am I doing? These little things are so vulgar.' 

 "Which ones would you prefer to change into?" He asked. 

 "Oh! I don't know you decide." She said. 'What the hell am I saying? It was bad enough showing him these naughty things and the idea of wearing them is so embarrassing. I can't walk around with him knowing what underwear I have on, especially these flimsy little panties. 

 He looked at the frown upon her face and guessed at the turmoil of thoughts. "You're wondering why you are here." He had her full attention and decided to push it further along. The commands last night set her up for this morning's phone call but she needed greater reinforcement. 

 "Take a look at yourself in the mirror." He said. She still wasn't aware of the clothes she was wearing having been ordered to ignore the changes to her appearance. It was time to remind her. 

 "What kind of woman do you look like?" He asked. 

 "Like a dumb blonde?" She replied. 'Damn, what's happened to my voice? I sound like a pathetic squeaky doll. How did I get to look like this? It's so difficult to think straight.' She thought. 

 "That's right, you look like, sound like and think like a dumb blonde." He told her with a firm voice. "So what are you?" 

 "I'm a dumb blonde." She replied. 'That little squeaky voice again, what is happening to me?' She wondered, feeling more confused than ever. Every time she tried to search for a reason for what was happening a cloud seemed to obscure her thinking. 

 'So I'm a dumb blonde, well that explains why I can't think straight.' She mused. The thought seemed to relax her somewhat. 

 "Keep looking into the mirror. What are you wearing?" 

 "I'm wearing a maid uniform." She said with a look of surprise. 'Why am I wearing this getup?' She wondered. 

 "If you're wearing a maid uniform then what does that mean?" He asked smoothly. 

 "I... I guess I'm a maid?" She said in a sing-song girly voice. 

 "That's right, good girl. You're in my house so that makes you my maid doesn't it." 

 She stared at herself in the mirror not wanting to believe the image. She turned from side to side but it was her as unsettling the idea was. The more she stared the more she accepted the new look. After all she picked the dress and came here wearing it so it must be true. "Yes Sir." She replied. 

 "Does it look sexy do you think?" 

 "Yes sir. It looks, it looks, sexy. " She said. 'The petticoats look so sweet and feminine it's just so lovely.' She cooed to herself. Helen wanted to twirl the pretty dress around and around but couldn't take her eyes away from the mirror. 

 "So take a good look at yourself and tell me what you are." 

 "I'm you're maid, sir. I mean I'm your sexy French maid sir." She said with a girly giggle. 

 "Good girl you have worked out what you are doing here. As you said you are my sexy French maid." He told her. 

 "Yes, sir, thank you sir." She said with an inane giggle. 'I feel much better knowing why I'm here.' She thought. 

 "I am the master in this house, so as you are a servant here, that makes me your master. Do you understand?" He watched her struggling with the idea hoping she would accept all he told her. 

 'I'm a maid obviously but there seems to be something else I should remember. Something isn't right but it seems so difficult to think clearly.' Giving up she replied. 

 "I am a maid and a servant in your house so you are my master." She said. There was a nagging doubt and she wondered if this was right. 

 "Good girl, that is correct. What will you do now?" He asked. 

 "Well?" She pondered a moment still looking at the image in the mirror. The powerful image was reinforcing his words and steering her thoughts. "I'm your sexy French maid and I'm waiting for your orders, Sir." She said, trying hard to dispel the doubts. 

 "That's a good girl you are right again. You must wait on my instructions and obey my orders. So, as my sexy French maid you will be doing what ever your master commands. Is that clear?" He asked. 

 "Yes, thank you sir." She felt much better now her master had cleared everything up for her. It was nice to know her place and what to do. A feeling of contentment swept over her now she no longer had to think too much. 

 She turned from the mirror to face him and looked down at the floor between her feet. Though her breasts got in the way she nevertheless struck a subservient pose. 

 "I am your sexy French maid and must do as I'm told, Sir. Do you have instructions for me, sir?" 

 "One more thing, what happens when you disobey me?" He asked. 

 "Oh! I shan't disobey you sir. I promise to do what ever you want of me, honest, sir." She cooed looking startled at the idea. 

 "But if you do something wrong what then?" He teased. 

 She put a finger to her lips and wrinkled her brow as though it were a difficult question. "Hmmm. You will punish me, sir." She said quietly. 

 "Yes that's right, so be a good girl and always do as I tell you." He smiled. 

 Her face lit up and it looked as though she was about to skip on the spot with pleasure. "Oh yes sir, I will. Thank you, sir." 

 "Now go and change your panties those ones look uncomfortable cutting into you." He ordered. 

 "Yes sir. Oh!" She stuck a finger in her mouth and looked at the panties. 

 For a moment he thought she might rebel now that he had ordered her to do something 

 "I'm such a silly dumb blond I can't decide. Sorry sir. Which ones should I wear Master." She asked politely, with a worried frown. 

 She looked up at him with such eagerness to hear his opinion he couldn't help laughing. 

 Roger needed to take a deep breath to calm him self realising how far the plan had been stretched. He had only intended to embarrass her. The idea had been concocted while angry, to have her arrive here dressed in some silly costume, then awaken her. 

 Instead this important business woman was in his home dressed as a sexy French maid behaving like a dumb blonde. A woman who was used to daily making important decisions was eagerly awaiting his decision on what panties to wear. 

 Regaining his composure he announced. "Those little ones there look good." He laughed. He sat back in the sofa more relaxed seeing not only had the plan worked he had stretched it beyond all expectations. 

 *** 

 On the way to her room she tried to remember what these little panties were called but then maybe there wasn't a special name for them after all. They felt nice and smooth cupping her sex so snugly. They were the ones her master had picked for her so they became the most favourite little pair of panties ever. 

 She ran down the stairs keen to get back to serve her master. She slipped the high heels back on and entered with a big smile upon her face. 

 She needn't have lifted the dress it was too short to conceal the little piece of lace but she did anyway. Seeking her master's approval she beamed at him when he told her how wonderful she looked. 

 "We will have dinner in a moment but first there is something I've wanted to teach you. Remember I am your master and you must obey me." He watched her head bob in acknowledgement. "Get on your knees right there. Unzip my trousers and pull my cock out." He said, plainly as though ordering lunch. 

 Kneeling between his knees she wondered if this was the right thing to do. 'I'm such a dumb blonde! I've played with his penis before and besides he is my master so I must do as I'm told. I'm such a silly little thing it's a good job I have him to tell me what to do.' 

 He watched fascinated as she carefully pulled his shirt clear then her hand emerged gripping his cock. "I want you to lick it then suck it into your mouth. I want you to give me the best blow job ever." He commanded. 

 With a gleam in his eye he watched every move absolutely enthralled at the care she took stroking and caressing his hardness. When she sucked his cock into her mouth he nearly blew. As it travelled through those ruby red lips it seemed they had been especially shaped just for his cock. 

 Having been so long waiting for this moment he soon came. He only just managed to keep his eyes open not wanting to miss anything. He pumped strings of sperm into her mouth feeling every drop pass its head in uncontrollable spasms. 

 He wanted to grab her head to bury his cock down her throat but refrained knowing how inexperienced she was. He gained that knowledge last night. He would take it easy and teach her. 

 Seeing she was looking to spit out a mouthful of his cum he told her. "Show me, open your mouth. You can swallow it now." He instructed. "I shall have to teach you to do it properly." He grinned. 

 "I'm sorry master. Are you going to punish me?" She asked looking up at him with large innocent blue eyes. 

 He sighed deeply bringing his breathing back to normal. "You did well. That was wonderful. You need to learn to take it down your throat though. It will take time but you can do it." He promised. 

 "I'm eager to learn sir." She said and meant it. 

 When she stood he noticed her panties, or rather the bit of silk only just covering her pussy. It was soaking wet. He smiled and teased her. "Have you wet yourself?" 

 "Oh! No sir. I'm excited." She faltered not sure if she should have revealed such a personal thing. Would her master chastise her for being rude? 

 "Let me take a look. I might be able to teach you something else." He smiled and it turned into a broad grin seeing her perplexed look. Lie back on the floor and spread your legs. Wider, just do as you're told." He pulled the silk away from her lips and ran a finger between them. 

 She shivered and ever so slightly raised her hips. He noticed but was sure she wasn't even aware of the movement. He reached onto the sofa and grabbed a couple of cushions to push under her hips. Her freshly waxed pubis was so smooth his fingers glided there barely touching the sensitive skin. 

 As he stroked her thighs he thought about how successful this hastily concocted plan had become. A wealthy woman who ran her own company was happily settling in as his personal servant. 

 It was far more than that! 

 The instructions he gave her this afternoon ended up turning her into a dumb blonde unable to think for herself. This led to accepting him as master, ready to obey without thought. This was obvious for the important business woman was lying back on the carpet in a very un-lady like pose clearly enjoying his touch by the look of her soaking wet pussy. 

 He wanted to jump up and shout in pure joy. 

 She lifted her hips and made a keening sound clearly needing more. Roger pulled is attention back to the here and now concentrating on the job in hand. 

 He moved his fingers between her lips to a hardened bud to find a special rhythm that suited her. Before she could cum the movement stopped leaving her wriggling in frustration. With a wet finger he pressed the little puckered brown-hole teasing it with gentle movements. As soon as it relaxed a finger flowed in up to the palm 

 Again she was on the verge of an orgasm but he held the fingers still and bit her thigh. It didn't bring her back much but prevented it. He blew upon an over sensitive sex and started very slowly building up to her rhythm again. She tried to hasten the build-up but he held her hips to the floor. 

 She didn't feel anything for her body was doing all the thinking now. Her brain had been swamped by arousal so intense her mind failed to cope. 

 Her eyes opened wide. 

 Roger looked up from concentrating upon her sex to see large vacant baby blue eyes filled wit lust. They burned with expectation. Her face grimaced into a mask of pain but he knew what it really signified. Sweat poured from her body, her nipples looked ready to explode. 

 He quickly moved up her body with licks and nips from his teeth not hesitating when his penis reached between her lips. He plunged in hard burying his cock deep inside. She reacted instantly. Throwing back her head she let out a yell from deep within her belly.  

 

 ****** Forgetful Maid ****** byStoryTeller07© One violent thrust of her hips was all she managed before every muscle quaked in a racking judder. Her legs lifted high and wide to capture all of him then wrapped them around his waist pulling tight to keep it penetrating deep as possible. 

 She was completely dependent upon his thrusts for she couldn't move. He pushed home one final thrust before spurting into her. Another orgasm spread from her clenched belly following heated nerves to curl her toes and hands clenched tight. 

 She wrapped her arms around his back needing to be completely engulfed by him. Whimpering a slight little sound she breathed out barely audible words. "Thank you, Master."  

 

 ****** Forgetful Maid Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07© "That meeting this morning, I've got the promotion!" Nigel declared. He didn't ask how she was or where she had been he just launched into what it meant to him and what he was going to do next. 

 Helen put down the shopping bags and smiled. "That is just wonderful darling. So when are you jetting off on a tour of your empire?" 

 "As soon as possible the boss said. I thought I was going to get to call him by his first name but he likes to be called the boss." He chuckled. "It's all arranged, flights and everything. Tomorrow afternoon I fly out on the first leg to be there early Monday morning. Catch them on the hop he said." 

 She smiled feeling pleased for him. Perhaps now he might feel less threatened by her position. If only he wasn't leaving so soon, she needed him in bed. The curious thing was she no longer felt the urgency so maybe she was getting used to being neglected. A grass widow her friends called it yet he had never had time even for golf. 

 As a dutiful wife she packed his bags and drove him to the airport. They hugged but it was obvious he was more interested in meeting this new challenge. He hadn't even mentioned her new look. During the day she had wondered about it herself. She would have to bring her long hair under control, it looked wild. 

 She watched him board the plane and sighed. "Oh, well. I'll have a quiet evening in, as usual." Stuck in traffic she pulled a phone from her purse and tapped a short code with a long gaudy fingernail. Before her friend could speak she asked. "Do you mind if I drop round, Nigel has trotted off on company business and I need cheering up. Sorry wrong number." 

 The traffic moved off and she headed to her friends home hoping she would be in. When the door opened Helen stepped in then paused. The room was familiar and the man standing there was familiar. He seemed to be expecting her but surely this was the wrong place. She tried to think of her friends name but it slipped her memory. 

 As she followed him into the lounge it all seemed so familiar yet wrong. That man was Roger, she recognised him now. She felt so foolish, her friend must live next door and she had barged in on Roger. He obviously recognised her that's why he invited her in. What was she going to say? 

 She caught sight of herself in the mirror and almost groaned. Her hair was still in that dreadful style. She looked like a dumb blonde, what must he be thinking of her. She felt so stupid coming to the wrong house and looking so silly. 

 A little nervous giggle escaped her lips and she put a hand to her mouth. It was difficult to think straight and she wondered what to do to get out of this embarrassing situation. She couldn't seem to just tell him she was at the wrong house. 

 "You're soaking wet you will get a chill if you don't change out of those clothes." He told her. He watched to make sure she was still under the influence of the hypnosis and his instructions. 

 'How strange, I didn't notice the rain.' She shivered slightly feeling more confused. 'That's why I feel so light headed I'm coming down with a chill.' 

 Roger was amused on seeing her actually act as though the baggy tracksuit and t-shirt were wet. "There's a friends clothes upstairs you can change into." He said. "Go on, do as your told, run upstairs and change before you catch a cold. You can't miss them they're laid out on the bed." He chided her trying to sound like a favourite uncle as a reason for giving her orders. 

 Without thinking she did as told and thought she heard the trainers squelch on each tread of the stairs. Quickly stripping off she dropped the clothes in a heap glad to be out of the wet things. 

 Not noticing the dress for what it was she pulled it on thinking it was a bit tight but would do. 'That's handy this apron will help protect the lovely silk dress.' She thought. Pulling up a stocking she clipped it to the bustier straps smoothing and straightened the seams. The same again, then reached for the panties. 

 'Good grief. I can't wear any of these little things they won't cover hardly anything.' She thought. Her hand hesitated over the largest pair but noticed they were completely see-through. In a dilemma she picked at random. Quickly pulling them up she wriggled the flimsy things into place feeling it purse her sex but cover nothing else. 

 'Well it doesn't really matter no one will know what I'm wearing.' She thought. A last look in the mirror to straighten the dress brought her up with a start. "Good grief." She exclaimed. "My breasts are almost out on show. This thing is too short. I can't go down stairs looking like this." She whispered. 

 'Christ what will he think of me dressed like a stupid tart. I'll be the laughing stock of both his and my company dressed like this if he told anyone. If my employees saw me like this they would be shocked' 

 She stared in the mirror feeling embarrassed. "Damn! He tricked me into this somehow. I should have made some excuse and walked out. I must be stupid to have come up here in the first place. How did Roger get me to dress as a naughty French maid, it looks so degrading. Why didn't I notice this before? My hair! It makes me look like a stupid blonde bimbo especially with my breasts pushed up on display." 

 She continued to stare at the image while talking to her self. "I can't go down there like this I feel so stupid, it's humiliating to be looking so ridiculous. I'm dressed like a stupid dumb blonde and feel like one for being so silly. What can I do? I am so silly I can't think straight." She giggled like a little silly girl. 

 "Was that me, what's happening? I sound like a stupid dumb blonde now." With another giggle she told herself. "Get a grip honey." She giggled again. "Honey should be my name with such lovely honey coloured hair." 

 'No! Don't say such silly vacuous things, you're not a." The thought dried up as a cloud descended obscuring her thoughts. "The dress does feel nice and silky though." She said, while pulling it into place. She twirled the layers of taffeta in front of the mirror. "It is short but shows off my legs so well. It's nice and sexy so I'm sure he will like it. Oh! It's so gorgeous; I look the perfect sexy French maid." 

 "Come on down you've been up there for ages." Roger shouted up the stairs. He was worried she might be about to rebel from the careful conditioning he had put her through yesterday. He certainly hadn't expected her to turn up so soon. The instruction when she left had been to phone him when Nigel went on the planned tour of offices. 

 She phoned before arriving as instructed and thought it was a wrong number when he answered. At least this way he had some warning to prepare for her arrival. If someone was here he would give her a different answer and she would drive home instead thinking her friend was busy. 

 'He must be damn keen to have set off already.' Roger thought. If he had won the job Roger would have celebrated the whole weekend then crawled off Monday morning. The board had obviously settled for the steady man rather than the inspirational maverick. 

 "Oh dear I'm such a silly slowcoach. I had better get down there to serve him." She gave a twirl showing off the little dress with the frilly petticoats lifting it high around her hips. "Oh! It's so adorable, so frilly and girly." She giggled then trotted down stairs with the high heels in one hand. 

 Hesitating only to slip in to the heels she made an entrance with a worried look on her face. 'Oh dear, I hope I've done the right thing. I don't want to be punished for being a silly slowcoach.' Helen began to wonder at the thought but dismissed it as she needed to get her head together to fathom out what to do next. 

 "You look wonderful. It was certainly worth waiting for. Let me see you, give a twirl." He demanded with a big smile. 

 She did the best she could on high heels but then the slightest movement raised the hem to flutter up and down around her hips, the petticoats still bouncing around after the twirl. She was obviously wondering what the hell she was doing. He decided to push her along. 

 "You are such a silly thing you forgot to wear panties." He said as though ready to scold. 

 "Oh sir, I put on your favourites look." She exclaimed in consternation, lifting the dress for his inspection. 'What the hell am I doing?' She thought in an agony of humiliation. 

 "I see you're wearing those tiny little ones. Good girl, they are so you." He said with a big smile. 

 She relaxed feeling pleased with his approval. 'I'm such a silly head. I should leave the thinking to my, my master.' It didn't seem right to call Roger her master but decided not to worry about it and leave the thinking to him. 

 "Do you remember what I told you yesterday?" He asked. 

 "Oh, sir I'm such a silly little thing I can't remember." She put a finger to her gorgeous pouting lips as though it might help to think. 

 "I'm your sexy French maid. You are my master and Honey must do as she is told or will be punished. Oh! Have I disappointed you sir? You must punish me if I have been naughty." She said, looking down demurely while wiggling her hips from side to side. 

 "Do you want to be punished?" He asked, curious as to why she mentioned punishment. 

 "When Honey has been silly and done wrong of course my master must punish his little Honey bunch, sir." She said, with big blue eyes looking so innocent. 

 He was about to ask how but had to change the subject for he was already hard just looking at her and too close to an orgasm that he wanted to save. It would be such a waste to cum in his pants with this beautiful sexy woman to cum into. 

 'What did she call herself, Honey? This was something interesting too.' He thought. 

 It was hard to imagine her as she was, a dowdy business woman running an old established company. Looking at her now she obviously hid her sex appeal behind smart but boring business attire. Even the baggy sweats and t-shirt she turned up in hid her charms effectively. 

 Instead of making decisions concerning other peoples working lives she was waiting upon his decision whether to be punished for something. She had been reduced to thinking she was a silly little dumb blonde dependent on a master to think for her. The very idea that this intelligent attractive woman was ready to obey and submit to him was more than he could stand. 

 The very idea of it was busting his balls and he needed to cum soon and was determined it would be in her not his pants. 

 "Perhaps later." He croaked from a dry mouth. "Get me a drink of cold water I need to recover." He hoped she would take her time in the kitchen 

 She brought a drink and flashed him a smile of adoration, her hair a golden halo about her face. Bent over she presented a deep cleavage which he tried not to stare at for he couldn't take much more stimulation. 

 "Get on your knees, Honey." He said trying out the name she had given herself. 

 She dutifully positioned herself between his knees with a look of anticipation. 

 "I remember now sir. You are going to teach me to do that thing properly." She said. "Can I take it out now?" She asked politely. He nodded and she delved into his trousers gently, almost reverently, pulling his rock hard cock out. 

 She looked up at him with those baby blue eyes, with a hand wrapped around his cock. He just didn't want to think about teaching her to deep throat. A look of expectation on her face as she licked her luscious full lips coated with thick bright red lipstick mesmerised him. 

 Through an agony of anticipation it dawned on him she was waiting for permission to lick his cock as though he was giving her a lollypop for being a good little maid. "Just do what you did yesterday that will be more than enough." He croaked. 

 It was too much. He suddenly spurted when feeling her tongue on the head of his cock. He spurted strings of white sperm over her lips, over her face and into her hair. It dribbled down her chin and slithered into a deep cleavage. 

 "Oh! No! I'm sorry sir." She exclaimed. Still holding his cock with a firm grip she knelt before him not knowing what to do. 

 Roger wasn't pleased with himself and it showed. His particular orgasmic look was mixed with disappointment and displeasure as he always prided himself on being in control. "You had better finish the job. Suck it clean." He added, on seeing her confused look. 

 He had to admit she made up for his failure by prolonging the pleasure. He sat back to simply watch her work away at his cock with little skill but lots of energy. "Whoa! Don't squeeze so hard." Her hand loosened its grip continuing to massage his balls in an attempt to extract every drop of cum through his cock. 

 "Enough!" He said. He wondered if she would have continued all night if he hadn't stopped her. 

 The woman had been a stuck up bitch at company parties keeping to herself, too good to join in. It was just last week when all this started. He had just been told her husband had the job he was hoping for then ran into her while she was hypnotised as part of the entertainment. He took her onto the dance floor while she was helpless and illicitly began massaging her bottom finding she couldn't resist. It had been just a naughty little revenge on her husband. He hadn't thought this haughty woman would end up at his feet sucking his balls dry using his cock as a straw. 

 She sat back on her haunches with cum dripping over her face unsure of what to do next. The thought of her as Helen the owner of a successful company squatting at his feet covered in his cum was reviving him. What would her employees think if they could see their prude of a boss with that mess on her face? 

 "I'm sorry sir I've made such a mess. Did I spoil your pleasure?" She asked. 

 Still annoyed at himself he spoke more harshly than meant. "You had better clean yourself up." He watched her scurry away admiring a cute little tight ass as the dress bounced up with every step. It gave him another idea. He was going to train her to give deep throat so why not that too. 

 Roger noticed she had refreshed her make up too. She stood before him looking contrite swinging her hips from side to side. "Have you something to say?" He asked. 

 "I. I guess my master is going to punish me now, for being such a naughty clumsy maid." She said. 

 There seemed to be a suppressed smile on her face rather than sorrow. She had mentioned it before without prompting so he decided to play along. "How will I punish my naughty sexy maid?" He asked. 

 "O well?" She sucked on a finger looking as though it were a difficult question. "My master will put little naughty Honey over his knee for a spanking." She said looking up at him through long lashes. 

 The lascivious look together with the swinging of hips left him in no doubt that she wanted it. It wasn't his thing but he was never one to knock something he hadn't tried. 'Maybe she can teach me something.' He thought. 

 While trying to look and sound strict, and not laugh, he pointed to his lap. "Assume the position." He told her. She dawdled as though trying to avoid it but he knew better. The flare of petticoats was in the way so he slipped her further over his knee until he could get at her bare bottom. 

 "Why am I punishing you?" He asked. 

 "Your little sexy French maid has been naughty. Honey made a mess on her face instead of catching your lovely cum in her mouth, master." She said. 

 She sounded more eager than apologetic but still he wondered how hard to spank her. He looked at the tight round cheeks of her bottom enjoying the view. Pressed tight between the thighs her lips were protruding, growing and becoming wetter as he watched. 

 He wanted to delve in with a finger to find her bud but raised a hand instead. It was a soft thwack and she let out a pleasant squeal. It was a difficult position but he managed another on the other cheek, then again repeating it until both cheeks were red. 

 On her feet before him she stood with a satisfied look on her face. The pose, looking down at the floor, gave her the look of a chastened school girl. "What do you say now?" He asked. 

 "Thank you sir, thank you for spanking your naughty Honey." She said with an impish grin on her face. 

 "Go get some ointment from the bathroom and I'll sooth that sore bottom of yours." He told her. 

 He sat back on the sofa amused at the way she was progressing. He wondered why she had started calling herself Honey. Perhaps it was a new identity to protect Helen from the humiliation of being a sex pet. 

 This didn't fit in with her wanting to be spanked. So maybe she was enjoying all this and needed to distance it from the prudish Helen so as to let go. It didn't matter either way for he decided to just enjoy it while it lasted. 

 She was so hot she could hardly stand still fidgeting before him like bitch on heat. "What's the matter Honey?" He asked. 

 "Have I been too naughty to receive my reward, sir?" She asked. 

 "What reward is that?" He teased. 

 "Oh, sir, what you did to me before, it was, so nice. I've been punished for being so silly and I promise to do as I'm told and will be really, really good." She gushed. 

 "What did I do to you? Tell me exactly what you want." He pushed. 

 "I. It's too naughty to say." She giggled. "Will sir, please, do that naughty thing to my pussy? Honey wants to feel her master's wonderful cock in her pussy." She giggled with a hand to her mouth while swinging her hips, swishing the petticoats around them. 

 He could see the tight little cup of the panties failing to do its job as her lips puffed up swollen and wet. "You have asked so nicely, how could I refuse my little Honey anything." He grinned. 

 She whopped a little girly sound and jumped on the spot. "Oh! Thank you, sir!" She managed to say with a breathy voice already becoming husky. Without being told she lay back on the floor with her legs spread. 

 "Let me see that lovely Honey pot." He told her. She eagerly ripped the crotch of the panties away from a shaved pussy and giggled with pleasure. 

 Roger pushed a cushion under her raised hips and settled between her legs blowing upon a pair of hot lips. He licked her thighs moving up closer then missed the hot spot to kiss her belly. She moaned a little whining sound lifting her sex up to him rubbing it against his chest. 

 "Does my little sexy French maid want her master to suck the honey from her little pot?" He asked. 

 "MMMmmmm." She whimpered. 

 Roger looked at those blue eyes wide with expectation, her face framed by a halo of long blonde hair. The expression of desire was pathetic enough to match the cooing noises she made. He hesitated a moment taking in how wonderful it was to have this self-important business woman reduced to a sex pet mewling desperately for his cock. 

 His whole face dived at her sex. She was watching him and feeling his tongue pushing in to wriggle around straining to reach as far as possible. It withdrew with his mouth sucking her lips into his mouth where he nibbled them. Her head rocked back and she collapsed with a rending sound from deep within her throat. 

 

 Words spilled from her mouth on short panting breaths cut into meaningless syllables. He let go of the folds of her pussy after stretching them from her sex with his lips. In urgency he moved up her body not pausing to suck on her heaving breasts or kiss the voluptuous red lips. 

 She felt his cock enter and thrust deep up inside. Only the second time in many months had she been filled but no thought of the past was in her mind as she lived for this moment of feeling deeply penetrated and full of cock. The orgasm from his tongue hadn't completed before she was on the climb again. 

 With every deep thrust she whimpered. "Thank you, master." 

 His second orgasm would take time but it didn't seem like it. When the final push came he felt her bucking under his exhausted body. It wasn't just that she wanted more she was in the throws of a deep orgasm and needed to feel it all. Feeling his seed hit the neck of her womb sent her into overdrive, then as suddenly she crumpled back onto the carpet, sated.  

 

 ****** Forgetful Maid Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07© After a cuddle and snuggling close they eventually pulled apart to pull themselves together. They showered together with the hot tumult of water reviving somewhat their exhausted bodies. Once dressed in her baggy jeans and t-shirt he sent her home with fresh instructions. 

 He collapsed in a comfortable chair recovering with a favourite cognac. He would have to stop fucking her on the carpet as he had sore carpet burns to knees and elbows. He wondered what the reaction would be if he instructed her to remember these sessions; would it be utter humiliation or would she turn up anyway. 'This evening she had begged me to fuck her.' He reflected. 

 She obviously had little experience and had been neglected by her husband. A twinge of guilt was washed away by the fire of cognac in his belly. He almost fell asleep but shook himself deciding for once to have an early night. 

 *** 

 Helen sat in her office looking through the appointments. There seemed to be one missing, around six she was supposed to be somewhere then forgot about it knowing her secretary would remind her. 

 She shifted uncomfortably in the plush executive chair. "Come!" She said. It sounded like something naughty the way she said it and squirmed at the thought. It was understandable why her thoughts so often drifted to sex for she hadn't had any for so long. Yet recently she hadn't felt frustrated rather she felt happily contented. 

 "Hi Fred is everything ticking over OK?" She asked the production manager. 

 Fred wondered if he should plead the case for Robby once more. If he did she would probably dig her heels in further and if he didn't, would just go ahead and sack him. Either way it was a lose, lose situation. 

 "Can I persuade you not to let Robby go?" He asked with a heavy sigh. He knew she was trying to be as tough as her father but just didn't have his knowledge of the men; she wasn't close enough to know what made them tick. 

 "He let us down once too often. He has to go. I know he is a good craftsman but something has to be done." She said firmly. She wriggled in the seat a little as though impatient to get on. "Send him in and I'll see to it." She said stridently. 

 Helen seemed distracted while automatically going through the formalities hardly looking at him. She looked up from the file and interrupted herself to ask. "Your time keeping has been good up until recently, why did you arrive late that particular morning? You let us down on that important order." She looked at the file again. "The past two months you have been late almost every day." 

 Robby knew now why she was known as the bitch boss. He was being fired so why give her something more to rub his nose in. Under her stare he relented. "If you must know I lost my licence." He suddenly felt so much better. He had been too embarrassed to tell anyone even his wife. 

 "You lost your driving licence?" She asked distractedly. She thought of driving to her master's home to serve him so she could receive a lovely reward. 'Where the hell did that thought come from?' She wondered. Her face paled but she managed to drag her thoughts back to the office. 

 He nodded. "I had some speeding tickets. The new baby kept us up all night and I overslept then got caught several times trying to get in on time. The bus is hopeless, either not turning up or running late." He said in an outflow of words that deflated him. 

 Helen thought about it while fidgeting and bouncing a pencil on the desk. "OK!" She stood up and walked around her desk to him. He stood up automatically for the boss. "You're suspended for two weeks. But don't you dare tell anyone it's on full pay. Get some rest. In the mean time I'll sort out the transport issue." She barked at him, trying to sound tough. 

 Robby had endured the prospect of being fired for too long and now that weight had been lifted it left him speechless. With thoughts on nothing but his new family he reached around her waist and gave her a hug. 

 "Sorry." He said, staggering back on realising he had been too familiar with the 'boss bitch'. 

 "Well!" She stuttered. A warm feeling overcame her with a thought of lying back on a carpet being held tight after an almighty orgasm. A little girly giggle escaped her lips but she didn't notice it for the disturbing thought had shaken her. She shook her head free of the image. 

 "Don't go out there looking so pleased with yourself you are supposed to have been disciplined for lateness." She warned him. A feeling of being over a man's knees being disciplined flashed through her mind. With heart racing she quickly dismissed the disturbing picture. 

 "I'll just say I'm pleased not to have been fired and I am, thank you. Thank you very much boss." He shyly smiled and quickly left. On his way out he determined to bite the head off anyone he heard call her a bitch. 

 She didn't hear what he said for at the mention of discipline she felt as though she was the one to be disciplined, but for what? She felt dizzy and leant over the desk. She wriggled her bottom feeling it was sore and for a moment imagined she was over a master's knee being spanked. She put her finger to her mouth trying to think what the punishment might be for. 

 The imagery and feeling disappeared and she straightened up. "It's close to lunch time I must have low blood sugar." She said to herself. 'I wonder what delights they have in the canteen today.' The thought was tinged with irony but she didn't laugh. 

 In a private bathroom attached to her office Helen lifted her skirt. She pulled something from her bottom and gasped. "What the hell is this? No wonder I've been uncomfortable all morning." She timidly held a butt plug in her fingers as though it were a rat then threw it into the toilet and flushed it away. 

 Sitting in the cubicle she tried to think when she had inserted the disgusting thing and why but her thoughts clouded deeper the more she tried. Yesterday and a late evening purchase came to mind but the why eluded her. 

 She washed her hands and delved into a bag for makeup but the hand found, as though of its own accord, something else. Without a thought of what she was doing she lifted the hem of the skirt and bent forward. Spreading her legs she wiped her bottom with some lubricant and felt some relief from the cooling gel. 

 

 With some difficulty she managed to relax enough to squeeze a slightly larger butt plug into her tight asshole. 'That's number three in place.' She thought, feeling pleased with a sense of accomplishment. A coquettish giggle escaped her lips and she frowned in consternation at the ridiculous sound. 

 Helen looked around the room feeling uneasy but saw nothing untoward so refreshed her make-up before stepping back into the office. She wore the usual staid business suit but her hair and make up was far from usual. In the plush office she looked ever so slightly like a dumb blonde secretary hired by an ageing male rather than the owner of a successful company. 

 Her secretary had asked Fred if he had noticed anything unusual about the boss but he was past noticing women and in any case all he cared about was not losing his best craftsman. If there was anything different about her then it could only be for the good for despite her past record she had changed her mind about firing him. 

 They would both have been surprised if they caught sight of the underwear she wore, let alone the butt plug. The stockings and suspenders with see-through panties were more uncharacteristic than the make-up. 

 *** 

 "Thanks for taking care of Robby. It would have been difficult to replace him." Fred was saying but stopped to watch her eat. As usual they sat in the canteen at a table reserved just for them. What had fazed him was the way she was eating a banana. She hadn't bitten it but was slowly pushing it between her pursed lips into her mouth, whole. 

 Helen choked and pulled it back out of her mouth and tried again. This time it almost disappeared with the tips of her fingers gripping the skin at one end. She seemed satisfied as though completing an experiment. She bit the end off and put her hand to her mouth laughing. 

 He thought he heard a silly giggle but the hand disguised the sound. He looked away in embarrassment trying not to think what the demonstration looked like. It must be something else, perhaps to do with scuba diving or something. 

 "What were you saying Fred." She asked, looking unperturbed, as though nothing unusual had occurred. 

 Fred realised he had stopped eating to watch the spectacle of a banana sliding between those luscious red lips. He still had a mouth full and nearly choked himself trying to reply. He swallowed then told her. "It doesn't matter, nothing important." 

 *** 

 Helen phoned her husband but all he wanted to chat about was the inefficiency of an office he was visiting. "It's been a tiring day so when I'm finished up here I'll get a bite to eat then hit the sack." He said. 

 She knew it was his way of saying he wouldn't be phoning later. On putting the phone down she grabbed a bag and just upped and left. On the drive home she wondered at the feeling of satisfaction she felt. Perhaps she was becoming used to the neglect and was settling into the boring routine of married life. 

 "Damn, I must be getting piles or something." She told herself while fidgeting at some traffic lights. Deciding on a diversion she stopped at a store and marched in knowing exactly what she wanted. It didn't take long so was soon on the way with a new outfit for the office. Something else was needed but she couldn't think what only knowing where to browse. 

 The same bored assistant sat behind the desk reading a boating magazine but stood up when she entered the store. 'If she's bringing that expensive outfit back she'll be disappointed.' Liz thought. Helen put down the bag in front of the counter and Liz saw it was from another store and relaxed. 'So she's back for more. That last outfit must have worked on her husband then.' She figured. A glint of a dollar sign lit a hazel eye. 

 "What can I get you today?" She asked, with a half-hearted smile. 

 "I'm not sure." Helen said, putting a little finger to pouting lips. 

 Liz was good at remembering faces and customers' needs even though there were all sorts shopping there. This one wasn't particularly kinky but if she remembered right there was something different about her. Liz looked the customer up and down remembering the smart expensive clothes, this time a business suit, with the incongruous hair and makeup. Now the woman was acting coy and twee, which was different from when she marched in last time. 

 "Let me show you something I think you will just love, honey." She said. 

 "Oh! You are clever you guessed my name." Helen giggled. 

 Liz looked her over again with a look of disdain. Whatever kinky games she played at home was fine but not here in the store. She expected customers to show a little restraint, except the bondage ones that is. Remembering how much this woman spent last time she decided to give a little for the sake of the commission. 

 "What do you think of this, nice or what?" Liz held up a small pink dress finished with fluffy white cotton to the hem and sleeves. She remembered the first batch was usually brought back as there was too much fluffy stuff, making the wearer sneeze. 

 "Oh it's lovely, so pretty." Helen said with a thrill of delight lighting her eyes. 

 "Try it on and I'll get the underwear to match. Go ahead, try in on." Liz ordered. Well if she was going to play the little dumb tart Liz would play the bully or ugly sister if she spent enough. 

 Liz wanted a cigarette. Joe would be in soon allowing her to escape for a smoke break before the evening kinky crowd arrived. She reached for a bunch of cellophane wrapped underwear and accessories remembering the sizes and picked the most expensive. The smaller the underwear the more expensive was the general rule. Pure silk it stated on the label but she doubted it. 

 "Hi Liz howyadoin?" Joe asked. 

 "I've got a girly customer changing. I need a smoke but it's my commission, OK!" She said and slapped the packages to his chest where he had to grab them quick. 

 "Ok! No problem." He said to a retreating back. "Jeez! I hope she's in a better mood after a cigarette." 

 Liz was a small woman with a big attitude compared to Joe who was a big easy going guy. His large frame, rugged looks and easy going nature appealed to the men who liked to dress in girly outfits and in turn Joe liked these polite and courteous customers who valued his opinion. 

 He sauntered over to the changing cubicle as Helen appeared. He looked her over in surprise. This was some convincing girly guy. He stood there watching the twirling dress rise and caught sight of a bare ass as it rode up. This was no guy into girly dresses she was all woman. The cleavage was deep, the legs shapely and such a cute ass he almost whistled. "Nice!" He said. 

 "Thank you, I think it's so adorable and cute, I must have it." She gushed. 

 He was surprised to find an attractive woman with a pleasant almost humble attitude for he had classed her with the usual uppity middle class women that thought they were above such sleazy places. They were usual condescending to the point of being rude. 

 "What panties are you wearing with that?" He asked. Meaning to push the ones Liz had shoved at him. It didn't matter about the commission he needed to keep Liz happy or at least keep the bitch off his back. 

 Helen lifted the front of the dress up to her navel in front of the mirror as though she couldn't remember what she was wearing. Joe watched over her shoulder. He smiled at the sight of a bald pussy. "I guess you'll need these." He said, with a smile being the extent of his sales technique. 

 He displayed the range fanning them out in his big hands. "Which ones do you like?" He asked then realised Liz meant to sell them all. 

 "Oh!" She said and pushed a finger into her mouth, creasing her brow in thought. "They are all so pink and perfect. They will look so adorable with this lovely dress, I like them all. I'm just a silly I can't decide which ones though." She said wistfully. 

 "You must take them all then." He said with a master stroke of recovery. 

 She beamed at him looking into his eyes with her baby blues. "You are so clever and I'm so silly, I just wouldn't be able to decide. I'll do as you say and take them all. Thank you, sir." She said with a giggle. 'I must call him Sir as he is so clever and is giving me orders.' She thought. There was a nagging doubt that something was wrong with the decision but fuzziness clouded her thoughts so she filed it away for later. 

 Joe wasn't sure if she was making fun of him or just playing her game of dumb blonde. No one could be that dizzy so it had to be an act. 'Well, commission or no commission she's worth watching and waiting on.' He thought. They had Goths, Warrior Queens, and all sorts of women customers but not as attractive as this one. The inane giggle would get on his nerves but for such a gorgeous body it might be worth putting up with. 

 "Oh dear how does this work Sir?" She asked. A suspender belt was entangling her hands with its elastic straps like an octopus. 

 'Perhaps it should be marketed for those interested in bondage.' He mused. "Here let me give you a hand." He offered. 

 "Thanks, you are most kind, Sir." She said. She took everything he said as a command slowly becoming used to yet another man taking charge of her mind and body. 

 He pulled at the straps easily untangling it. She lifted the hem high up around her waist and looked up at him expectantly. A quiet whistle escaped his lips. If this was some kind of trap by friends capturing him on camera he was going to fall for it and fully enjoy the joke. 

 He bent to his knees in the small cubicle half expecting friends to jump out and laugh. Being so close to this gorgeous woman without grabbing her was hard work but someone had to do it. He was breathing in gasps as he slipped the belt around her hips, then it slithered from his hands onto the stained worn carpet. 

 "Oh! That tickles." She said. "You're blowing on my naughty bits, Sir." She giggled. 

 Her waist was slim and her thighs too looked as though she worked out and it was working on him. He was too close to her pussy for any moment he would lean in and lick it. With a tremendous amount of restraint he told her to turn around. "Lift the dress higher so I can clip it properly." He said. He wasn't sure if her ass was les of a distraction or not. "That's a titan number four isn't it." He said, in surprise. Shaking his head to clear it he wondered if this was just a dream. 

 "What is?" She asked. 

 "The butt plug. This thing up your ass is a Titan." He said. Joe hadn't really looked at her face. She must be the one who called late as he was closing up the other evening. He remembered she didn't look much in the baggy sweatshirt and baggy pants. "Is it comfortable?" He asked and felt awkward asking such a personal question. 

 "It makes me squirm sometimes. It is difficult fitting them as each one is bigger, Sir." She said. She wished he would hurry up as she needed to get to her friends place to show off these lovely new clothes. 

 "If I had known I would have fitted it for you. I'll fit the last one." He stared and choked on the idea of it, unable to finish the joke. 

 A feeling of doubt filled her as surely this couldn't be right, letting a stranger do such a thing to her. Of course, he sold her the set of butt plugs so must know what he is doing and is was an order and her master had told her to always obey orders. She felt so silly and fragile it might be better to leave the difficult task to a Sir. After all, she needed to prepare her little bottom as ordered by her master and must get it right for him. 

 "Oh! Well, I guess so. I'm such a silly little thing I find everything difficult to work out and might not do it right. Please fit it for me, Sir." She said. 

 Joe could feel his balls aching needing to burst. It would be shit to cum in his pants yet an offer like this didn't jump him that often. She wanted to play a little girly game with a big strong man so who was he to refuse. It would be a ball breaking disappointing not to actually fuck her but then what a tale to tell his friends at the bar. He watched her bent over with the dress riding right up around her hips. She rummaged in her purse a moment before coming up with the Titan number five and a tube of lubricant. 

 If she had taken much longer the sight of those swollen lips protruding between her thighs would have finished him. He had been working there long enough to know it was dangerous to join in with a customers' game but this was too much to resist. 

 "Bend over that chair." He told her. Helen gripped the seat, bent over the back of the chair with legs spread wide. With a hand on her ass he pulled at the butt plug feeling the resistance of its head at her asshole. He took his time until it popped out. The best bit was next and he took a greater pleasure in massaging the grease between her cheeks with a finger accidently nudging her sex. 

 Her asshole was open from being stretched by progressively larger plugs. He slipped a finger in just so as to lubricate a hole nothing more, not because he wanted too explore that beautiful body. Of course he did and the tension in him was almost overpowering. If he didn't get that butt plug in he would be filling the inviting asshole himself. 

 Telling her to relax he eased it into place. The sighs and groans were erotic but he managed to concentrate on the task. "Straighten up slowly and don't move until you get used to it." He told her. 

 "Thank you, sir." She told him. Aware of how excited she was brought a feeling of humiliation to overshadow it. She had thanked a stranger for pushing such an awful thing into her body and had become excited by it. What would her master say, would he punish her for being so wanton, for being such a slut. It felt big and powerful inside this tender place leaving her feeling so much more vulnerable and small, needing a man to submit to.  

 

 ****** Forgetful Maid Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07© "Joe! A word please." Liz said gruffly. The customer stood holding onto the chair while she dragged him out of the cubicle by an elbow. "What do you think you are doing you big lug?" She could see how carried away he was. "Rule number, one never get caught up in a customers stupid games it is too dangerous. When she gets home and snaps out of the fantasy and calls the police accusing you of rape, trouble! You are looking at trouble with a big 'T', bigger than her tits." 

 "Go make the coffee and I'll take care of the bitch." She saw the look of pain in his eyes knowing how much his penis had taken over the thinking. She grabbed his penis bulging in his jeans. "I'll take care of this for you too. I can do a better job than she ever could. Go make the coffee." She told him with a shove to his back. 

 In a state of shock he scrambled into the back room where the automatic routine of preparing coffee began to calm him. "Liz?" He said. He shook his head not believing it. She was no beauty but she had a certain something now he thought about the possibility of it. He didn't really want to contemplate what she meant it was too difficult adjusting to this new view of Liz the battle axe. 

 "You had better get some panties on, shows over." Liz told her. "Here these will do. Forget about winding Joe up, he's a nice guy. Just because he works in a place like this doesn't mean he's fair game. Go home to your husband and practice your fantasies on him. What would he say if he saw you playing the slut with a stranger?" 

 At the counter Helen handed over a credit card without a word said. Liz continued to exude poison with a challenging look that would have floored a bigger man than Joe let alone this little slut. Helen looked more vacant and confused than ever. Thoughts of a master and husband were colliding, not as concepts but memories, as reality broke through into consciousness and conscience. What she had being doing was good and so very bad. 

 In a daze from adjusting memories of the past few days, bringing everything together, she walked out to the car. Men commented on the dress or her, calling her a brazen hussy or desirable slut, it didn't matter for nothing penetrated, all went unheard. She sat there in a stupor not wanting to succumb to reality wanting it all to be a dream. Memories of great elicit sex became thrilling and exciting then hit hard with a dose of shame knowing who it had been with. What she had submitted to was both fulfilling and humiliating. 

 Unsure of where she was going or what to do she let her unconscious motivate the direction. Not knowing if this would be a showdown or a test of will she waited at the now familiar door knowing it was no friend she had come to visit. 

 Helen followed him into the lounge in a state of dread unsure if she could carry this through. A deep feeling of humiliation threatened to overwhelm her, to wipe out her resolve. Where she now stood, on this carpet, everything had been laid bare for this man. It was more despicable than that, she had grovelled at his feet in a shameful display of wanton lust. The combination of a growing sexual excitement and shame brought her low. 

 With the knowledge of what he had done to her, that these feelings were from his influence, she was no longer so vulnerable. The thoughts were now clear but it was still difficult to confront her master. Concentrating on the anger she powered a will to resist. 

 "Master, may I ask you a question?" She said. The pathetic little voice revealed she hadn't been completely successful. 

 "Of course you may my sweet little thing." Roger said. He smiled at her still marvelling at the image of a dowdy business woman transformed into a dumb blonde dressing to please him. The little pink flared dress was a bit over the top but is showed how submissive and compliant she had become, that she wanted to be. 

 "Why did you do this to me?" She asked. Her voice trembled and she dare not look at him. When she looked down the view was of her breasts pushed up in a deep cleavage as another presentation of her body to him. It was beginning to sink in that she had colluded with him in her downfall. This man had release something in her, a need to devote herself to a man and be wanted, a need to be dominated. 

 Roger was startled. He knew this moment would arise but figured the rebellion wouldn't be here but in her home, somewhere safe. He could handle a business confrontation but here he was going to have to contend with guilt. He reasoned she wouldn't have complied with anything she didn't want even if it had been something dark in her sub-conscious best left alone. 

 "What do you mean my pretty little pet?" He asked. 

 "You've turned me into your servant, a dumb blonde sex pet." She hesitated a moment. "You have shaped my thinking and my body for your use." She wriggled her bottom feeling the butt plug up her ass and gripped it tight trying to feel pain to fuel the anger that was beginning to recede. She needed to confront him with everything he had done to recharge the anger before she capitulated. 

 "You made me hold your sperm in my mouth in front of everyone." She complained. She couldn't mention her husband it was too disgraceful. "You dressed me up and made me into a stupid dumb blonde until I couldn't think straight. I was left so vulnerable you took advantage of me. You laid me out on the floor at your feet and took me. You made me into an unthinking fuck toy. I even practised sucking on a banana every chance I got until I can overcome the gag reflex. I have a large butt up my ass so you can." She faltered unable to continue. The indignity and shame was doing something to her. 

 Roger didn't want her going away from here blaming him for it all. If she cried rape his reputation would be severely dented even if the truth came out. "You didn't just do it for me. You must have wanted it too otherwise you would never have given in. We just happened to come across each other when the need was there. You have been a naughty lascivious slut because that is what you needed to be." He said. 

 Without thinking she answered. "Yes sir." It was true, she knew it. She had been a wanton slut craving his cock. After reminding her self of the humiliating things she had done her body was aroused and needed it now. It was no good denying it she had been his slut because she needed the humiliation and sex. The sex had been so good, too good. 

 He noticed a damp patch form in the panties while she provoked herself wondering if this would shake her free or overcome the better judgement. 

 "You are right sir. I've been a naughty wanton slut. I deserve to be punished. Please punish your silly maid for being such a naughty little slut." She pleaded. 

 He looked at her trying to fix a stern expression on his face. He patted his lap and she moved smoothly into place over his knee. The dress was short enough to ride up her hips for a close look at the full pink panties. They were loose not gripping her ass yet looked more attractive, more innocent. She eagerly lifted her hips for him to slide them off. 

 Roger had never seen a butt plug before and this one looked enormous. How on earth did she manage it? He remembered how tight it had been when pushing a finger inside while sucking on her pussy. He had ordered her to prepare it for him not really believing she would resort to such a depraved deed. "I can't smack your ass with this thing in there it might hurt you." He said, while pulling on it. "Try to relax and I'll take it out." 

 "Thank you, master." She responded. She felt it move and gasped a little whimper. Not from pain but from the agony of having yet another man taking such a close interest in her bottom. It popped like a cork released from a bottle. It was so terrible to be in this vulnerable position she closed her eyes tight unable to contemplate the image he had of her upturned ass. She could feel it gaping open and was unable to clench it closed. It was disgusting to think she had done this to herself. 

 "I shan't spank you it looks too sore." He said, though it looked alright, he had another idea instead. "Get some ointment from the bathroom." 

 She rolled off his knee onto the floor once again a humble shambles of emotion at his feet. From the disgrace of having stretched her once tight little bottom a need to be punished grew to a hot desire. She was reminded of the man in the sex shop fitting it in this once private place. It was devastating to know she had been so ready for a complete stranger. She was a nasty little whore and must be punished. 

 She ran off to fetch some grease for her kind fore-bearing master, wanting to get on with the punishment. Then perhaps she might have been cleansed of her sins enough to receive a reward. She felt his soft hands between her cheeks savouring the careful attention knowing it would contrast all the more with the stinging slaps. 

 "I think I might use that hole to punish you my slutty little maid." He told her. 

 "Oh master. That is such a humiliation for a woman, so degrading to have her ass used like that." She complained, wanting him to get on with the spanking. 

 "A greater punishment then, don't you think." He asked. 

 She groaned at the thought of it. "Yes, master." She sighed. He was right. He was going to punish her in a much more terrible way than a simple spanking like an errant schoolgirl. She had behaved like a nasty whore and this was appropriate to the crime. She kneeled on the floor with her forehead on the carpet. 

 She felt so disgraced in this position, bottom up, presented to him as though he owned it. She felt him kneel behind her fidgeting into position. His hard cock slapped her thighs eliciting a whimper. A man was going to take her ass as punishment for all those bad things she had done and she had made it possible, had prepared her asshole for this moment. 

 Feeling his lovely cock so close to her pussy a need to cry out for it arose in her throat but was stifled for she didn't deserve a reward. His cock nudged her hole and she wanted to cry out in shame. 'Please not this; just spank me for being naughty.' She whimpered silently. 

 Feeling it push past her sphincter so easily added to the humiliation. It seemed to fill her entire body. She felt his balls slap her lips and whimpered out loud. It slowly pulled back then slowly filled her with the strokes speeding up. It wasn't a delight but neither was it the horrendous punishment expected. 

 The familiar tensing of his muscles were soon felt so she knew what was to come next and became afraid. The feeling of a rush of cum was more keenly felt and shocking. She wanted to reach out to her pussy but dare not. This punishment was turning her on becoming a reward. 'Oh hell, he's giving me a sperm enema.' She thought and tightened her muscles unsure if it was in defence or to squeeze him dry. 

 He knelt behind her in the triumphant knowledge that he had conquered mind and body completely. "Up you get maid. Go fetch some fresh orange while I get cleaned up." He ordered. 

 *** 

 She sat on the floor at his feet waiting patiently wondering what was to befall her next. 

 "Let's see how well you practised with the banana." He said. 

 He sat back on the sofa for her to take his flaccid cock in both hands. She leant forward and kissed its tip almost reverently. He watched her suck it into her mouth between a pair of full luscious lips. It soon filled her mouth for a tongue to tickle and lips to suck. A light touch was used enough to bring it fully to life. He felt his cock hit the back of the throat expecting a reaction. 

 It was tight passing into her throat and the grip most enjoyable. He watched intently as this beautiful woman absorbed his cock between full lips forming a perfect O shape griping it tight. This wasn't the first time a woman had given him a blow job but this was far more than that, it was an act of devotion. She worked it with enthusiasm and every time she took it down her tight throat he almost came but managed to hold back. 

 He was nearly there "Stop, that's enough, I don't want to cum in there. I want your pussy." He said. 

 Helen was horrified on remembering the moment in the canteen practising deep throat with a banana. At home alone was bad enough but there in front of employees it was a shocking thing to do. Somehow it didn't seem bad to be overcoming her gag reflex for this man. Now it had been achieved it seemed so wrong to be pandering to his demands. 

 She was almost disappointed he didn't use her throat to cum into. 'He dressed me like a silly dumb slut, I sound like one and I'm behaving like one. He has me excited just thinking about my pussy being filled by him. It's become a reward for doing as I'm told. If I don't do something I'll never escape this degrading position.' She thought. 

 It dawned on her that the influence he had over her was spreading into the rest of her life, in the office and out. She had stretched her asshole for him at home and in her own office and visited that vile sex shop on his orders. She had even practised that naughty banana thing and even practised stretching her legs open for him at home. 

 Helen felt like screaming but couldn't be sure what. Was it for him or against him? Without being told she lay back on the floor with legs spread with a silly grin on her face. She wanted a reward for all that hard work. Her whole body tingled in anticipation of his touch. If she had wanted to resist him it was now impossible to mount a defence for all she wanted was to be mounted. 

 'Oh please master, I need my reward, fuck me, please.' She looked at him with eyes pleading for it, for his touch, to feel full of cock. 

 He slid off the sofa onto his knees between her legs and leaned over her belly. He kissed her flat stomach then licked a tortuous route downward. Lower and lower his tongue slid until contact with her lips brought a shudder and a sigh of delight. A delicate touch from fingers and lips just glazing her thighs and sex caused her heels to drum upon the floor the only sign of the internal thrill coursing through her body. 

 Helen lay inert upon the floor, quite still, her breathing shallow a heart racing. Her mind was immersed in every touch with sensations emanating from that one small place throughout her body. She felt him suck and explore more thoroughly inside reaching the so sensitive 'G' spot but couldn't stir. Needing to rise up and engulf him she was powerless to move as though he were sucking the very life force from her body. 

 His hands moved from her thighs up her torso to her breasts which he squeezed and pinched. She was on fire. There was only one thing that could save her from being consumed by the raging flames. As she felt his lips crawl up her naked body she knew where he was headed and a cry of anticipation slipped from her mouth, a guttural sound from deep in her belly. Nothing existed only his breathing and the smell of him still in her nostrils from taking his cock in her mouth. Tears of joy filled her eyes blurring sight, depriving her of another sense, leaving her world dominated by him. The sense of touch drove her mad with lust. 

 She felt a hardness brush a thigh not hesitating on its way into her body. The deep penetration set her off, not quelling the fire rather spreading it through every taught nerve. Her belly clenched and unclenched on feeling full of cock. The orgasm hit her hard quenching the fire for a moment, not putting it out, for he fanned the flames into life with hard deep thrusts. 

 She brought her legs up to wrapping them around him, clenching his buttocks with her heels. She hung on as he rode her vigorously toward another orgasm. All her good work left him determined to cum, however long it took. Another orgasm shook her less violent yet as satisfying in its completeness. More aware of what was happening she clung on wondering if this could continue for ever, one orgasm after another until she had been completely consumed. 

 On feeling his shuddering spasm a last small happening gripped her inside and in desperation she held on to his member knowing it was hopeless but trying anyway not wanting it to leave her empty. Her legs fell to the floor and she supported his weight wanting it to crush them into one. 

 "Thank you, master." She said. The simple words were heartfelt, all she could think or say. 

 *** 

 She brought cool drinks for them both, covered in nothing but fresh make-up and the after glow of multiple orgasms. She squatted at his feet and rolled the cold glass over her hot sex letting go a little giggle. 

 "Yes, Master?" She said, looking up at him through long eyelashes. 

 The innocent look of delight upon her face made it impossible to call her his slut. He had to remind himself this woman was an important business woman not a toy for his pleasure that she clearly wanted to be at his moment. He cleared his throat again. "You will have to get dressed and go home." 

 The look of hurt on her face snagged his conscience pulling him the wrong way. He had made the decision and must follow it through at all costs. 

 "Please master may I stay?" She asked, reverting to the silly little voice she used all evening. 

 "This is your last visit. We can't see each other again." He said with no small agony. 

 'There, it had been said, no going back now.' He thought. 

 "Please master let me be your sexy French maid! I'll do anything, just anything, honest. I'll be your little dumb blonde. I need you to tell me what to do, to be your servant. You can train me and I'll learn all the naughty things you like. I'll be obedient like a faithful pet. I can be your sex slave to keep for ever. If I've done wrong then punish me, but please don't send me away I beg you." She cried while hugging his legs. 

 Roger ignored the tirade of words spilling from those gorgeous red lips. He felt guilty from what he had reduced her to. He wanted a challenge, an equal partnership with a woman, not a pet or even a housewife. This experience had taught him that at least. He had expected her to break free of the hypnotic influence sooner or later but she seemed to revel in it, not wanting to let go. 

 It wasn't just a way of assuaging his guilt for he took responsibility for pulling the trigger on this bombshell that had exploded within her. Whatever it was hidden in her unconscious had swamped her morals leaving her so very vulnerable and he had taken advantage. 

 "This has got to stop. I am your master right now and you will obey my order." He said fiercely. It was difficult summoning anger but he had to force her to see sense. He watched her fall back as though slapped. "You will forget what happened here and all the other things you did for me. You will go home and be the dutiful housewife your husband longs for. You will do all the things he wants you to. Do you understand? Do you?" He demanded. 

 He watched the slight nod of her head. "You will enjoy being with him and enjoy pleasing him. You will try harder than you have, you will make it work." He said more gently this time. A sob shook her shoulders with tears smearing the make-up and he only just resisted taking her in his arms. 

 'I've go to do this!' He told himself. 

 She left without another word said. Her mind was in a whirl of need and humiliation while a part of her was fighting to regain the right path. 

 He didn't hug her as she turned to him at the door. Did he look as miserable as she did? If so the medicine cabinet would have to be emptied before the full impact overtook his feelings. He poured a large Cognac turned from the drinks cabinet then turned back for the bottle. He sat in the large wingback chair unable to sit on the sofa where they had been. 

 He sighed drunkenly. "Maybe, just maybe!" He raised the glass saluting the sofa and downed the fiery liquid. He wanted her to make a go of the marriage and so leave him alone to get on with his life. 'A master is burdened with responsibility, tied to a slave as much as the slave is tied.' He reminded himself. "If it doesn't work though, what then?" He said to the large empty room. Report_Story
