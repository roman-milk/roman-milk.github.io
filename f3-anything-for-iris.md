 * * * * 

 This is an introduction to the story of Cam, Sierra and Iris. It's part one of three, so there's no conclusion here. 

 "Did you hear about this? 'RacineCorp, a division of Devereaux Holdings, reports 3rd quarter profits up 18%.' Eighteen percent? In a year like this?" 

 Sierra stopped swimming and settled onto the soft white sand beneath the cantilevered benches, glaring up at her boss. "Shut the hell up, Cam," she hissed. "You want to blow everything?" 

 Cameron realized she was correct, but could hardly let her know that. He closed the report and swung over to the edge, his feet dangling a few feet above the crystal clear Indian Ocean water. "Just reading the financial news, Sy. Nothing wrong with that is there?" 

 Sierra was still having a difficult time adjusting to this new Cameron. As driven as her, she'd never seen him without his suit and tie, even when working in the lab. At most he'd take off his coat. Even during testing, he'd worn a full wetsuit. He didn't socialize, outside of business events, and if she had to bet on it, she'd guess his pasty white skin hadn't seen direct sunlight in at least a decade. Still, she had to confess, he may not have been a hard body, but wearing nothing but a swim suit, he wasn't hard on the eyes. 

 The thought had her adjusting her red one-piece, which tended to ride up on her ass. She didn't have enough curves to keep the top or bottom in place. At least the design of the suit gave the impression of curves which were conspicuously absent. 

 "You were the one that insisted we don't talk about it. Don't even acknowledge their presence," she argued, holding her hand above her eyes to cut down on the tropical glare. 

 Cameron wanted to laugh at his partner in crime. 30% partner, and worth every damn dime of it. She was without parallel in the lab, but in public? She had the social graces of a rhino. "Look around, Sy. Not a soul in sight. The water taxis won't arrive until this afternoon. There aren't 20 people in the entire resort. Relax, skinny-minny." 

 Damn, she hated when he called her that. However she knew if she responded at all, it would only get worse. That was the nature of an engineering lab. Let 'em find your weak spot, and they keep picking at it, worrying it like a bone, until you broke. "I am relaxing. You should try the water. The visibility goes on forever. It's ideal for our purpose. Besides, if you don't get out of the sun, you're gonna burn to a crisp. Lot of good you'll be then." 

 He laughed, and slipped over the edge, dropping into the warm water not more than knee deep. He leaned over and dove outward, disappearing under the surface, coming up a good 15 meters out, shaking his shaggy hair. "You coming? Race you to our hut." He turned and cut through the water with a smooth easy stroke that surprised her. 

 Sierra considered everything a challenge. There was no way that Cam could out swim her. Not in this lifetime. He never saw the light of day. She competed in Ironman's across the country. Finished the Kailua-Kona in 9:12:22. She glanced up at her destination, and took off at full-speed. It wasn't more than 200 meters to the end of the row of stilted huts, so she'd have to work hard to catch him, what with the cheater's huge head start. 

 Passing the third hut, she was only half a dozen meters behind him, but try as she might, she couldn't make up that ground. She shifted to a new breathing stroke, alternating sides as she sped up her kick. The distance narrowed, three meters with two huts to go. She was tiring, but kept pushing. She knew how to fight through the pain, pulling alongside him, her hand brushing his calf. Only one cabin to go. 

 Then he was gone. She looked up, and saw him climbing onto the mini-dock of their 'suite on stilts', as Ibrahim had called it when he showed them around. 

 She grabbed the railing, breathing hard, trying to catch her breath. Cameron reached down to give her a hand up, but she ignored it. The asshole was smirking, not even breathing hard. 

 "How the fuck-" 

 "Make it a mile, and you'd kicked my butt, Sy. The 200 was my race in high- school." He shook his hair like a shaggy dog, reached up to the table on the main balcony, and grabbed a couple of towels, offering her one. 

 "I didn't know you swam competitively," she said, rubbing the towel through her hair. 

 He laughed again. "I imagine there's a lot you don't know about me, skinny- minny." 

 "I wish you wouldn't call me that," she blurted, before she could stop herself. Shit. Now she'd done it. She'd never hear the end of it. 

 Cameron wrapped the towel around his waist, and turned to climb the stairs up to the top balcony. "Sorry. I though you liked that name. You never said anything about it." 

 She followed on his heels, angry with herself for showing her weakness, and with him, suckering her into that race. "What woman wants to be reminded she's an androgynous stick? If I said anything in the lab, I'd never hear the end of it." 

 Cameron pulled the cork out of their welcome bottle of champagne, and poured them each a glass. "My apologies. And you're anything but androgynous, Sierra." He stood beside one of the two lounge chairs, and passed her the glass, taking his time looking her body over. 

 Sierra felt herself blushing while he obviously checked her out. "You said this would be professional," she reminded him. 

 "Absolutely. You're the one that said I should relax. What could be more relaxing than a leisurely swim, laying out on a deck in paradise, and sharing a bottle of champagne with my beautiful wife?" He grinned as he spoke, mischief in his eyes. 

 Sierra glanced at the large diamond on her finger. Diamonique, she corrected herself, 2 carat solitaire, with matching eternity wedding band. The $500 set looked like it was worth closer to $15 grand. She still couldn't believe she'd let him talk her into it. He was right of course, as he usually was, damn him. If things went as they hoped, there was little doubt someone would check up on their story. The 'honeymooning couple' cover had to stand up. What better way than to actually get married? She reminded herself it was only a piece of paper, with pre-nups in place, and they could bow out gracefully once their plans worked out. 

 "You're sure, hubby dear, this is the right suite?" she asked. 

 "You know as well as I do. It's gotta be at least 90% likely. The day after their board of directors selected this location, only one luxury suite was reserved. That one," he pointed across the water, at the building located on the end of the pier adjacent to theirs. From their deck, they could see only one other building, making it the most private out there. The one across the way was the same. About as secluded as they could get, on the property. Perfect for newlyweds, or an eccentric, reclusive multi-millionaire. 

 "But what if it isn't?" 

 Cameron shrugged. "We deal with it. We'll figure out a way. It's not like you and I aren't good at solving problems, right?" 

 She nodded, sipping her champagne, settling back into the comfortable lounge chair. He was right about that. Nobody better. It's why they worked so well together. They might cross swords a lot, but together they'd proven that no problem was insurmountable. That's why they were there. 

 "Want to give it a test?" Sierra asked, glancing over at their pride and joy. 

 "I thought you'd never ask," he said grinning, looking back over his shoulder to the huge canopy bed. 

 "Test Iris, you pig," she growled, stifling a grin of her own. "You said no shenanigans. You promised, Cam." 

 "I'm just teasing you, Sy. We're going to be in close contact for the next 5 days. If you act like you can't stand to be around me, you're going to blow our cover for sure." 

 Right again. Damn it. She stood, and opened her arms. "Come here, husband mine. One little kiss, and we'll take Iris for a spin." She could play along. It was only for show. 

 Cameron was surprised by her actions. He stood and gently pulled her into his arms. He looked down into her pretty eyes, so much better than those ugly glasses she habitually wore. "No more glasses for you. They hide your beautiful eyes." 

 His words gave her goose bumps. For a moment, he seemed sincere. Not joking, not teasing. His lips met hers, gentle, caressing. Hers parted automatically, and she felt the edge of his tongue brushing her lip. Her eyes closed as she surrendered for a moment, then his lips were gone. Cameron was looking down at her intently. "I'm not going to have difficult time acting like a newlywed. Are you?" 

 Sierra felt his firm hug, his body pressed against hers. The warmth of his skin heated where they met. "I can put on as good a show as you. It's only a few hours each day, right?" 

 His hand slid up her back, caressing the back of her neck, sending a shiver down her spine, before cupping the back of her head. She couldn't move, couldn't resist, when his face lowered over hers, his mouth descending, demanding, kissing her deeply, before sliding away to whisper in her ear. "As many as it takes, Sierra dear." 

 It took a moment for her to catch her breath, then she was sliding out of his grasp, turning to their dive bags. "Behave, Cam." 

 He watched her from behind, her tight little buns on display as she bent down and pulled out his Iris unit. She passed it back without looking and he took it from her. He checked the battery life, and pressed the three button diagnostics test combination. The LEDs cycled successfully. 

 He looked up, and she had her own unit in hand, checking settings, connections, making sure everything was set. 

 The Intelligent Respirator and Imaging System, IRIS, was their pride and joy. Three years of development, stemming from an argument the two of them had had about the utility of integrating smarts with an advanced shallow depth snorkeling mask. It had developed into so much more. 

 She looked up at him smiling. "It is beautiful, isn't it?" 

 Almost as beautiful as her, he thought. When she let it show. "You did an incredible job, Sy. I'll never deny that. Best work I've ever seen." 

 She wasn't about to argue. He was right. Many of the technology advances might be his, but the design and integration, the art and beauty, those were hers. "Why can't they see it?" she asked softly. 

 "They're idiots, with no vision. It's like nothing else, so it doesn't make sense to them. Horatios, all of them." 

 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. The banner over the entrance to their lab. Their motto. 

 "And you think Devereaux has that vision?" she asked, begging for reassurance. This was their last shot. They were broke, drained, credit cards maxed. This ten-thousand dollar last gasp was all they had left. It had to work. And if that meant playing house with Cameron Riddle for a few days, she was willing to go along. 

 "I'm positive. Have faith, Sierra. We've created something wondrous. Someone will recognize it for what it is." 

 She sprayed the interior glass with the defogger, passed it to him, and walked down to the water access deck. She slipped her feet into the swim fins, and jumped into the water. Kicking lightly, she lowered her head into the water, brushed her hair back, and pressed IRIS against her face. The protocol flashed in front of her eyes on the heads-up display. She breathed in deep, while the mask sealed itself, then she felt the valves reset as the pressure gauge indicated no leaks. 

 She ignored the splash at her side, as Cameron entered the water. "Iris, activate all systems." The gauges lit up, and the magic happened. She still found it hard to believe what Cam had managed, developing the artificial gills that provided the oxygen for their system. He'd somehow reduced the battery weight to barely a kilo, almost negligible underwater. With the power available, Sierra had been responsible for the electronics that ran the system. To her, it was a natural leap to create a state of the art, heads up display system, managed by a voice controlled AI. Thus, the imaging system component of their intelligent rebreather. 

 Sierra strapped the sleek pack to her back, only three inches high, with the large water intakes exposed on top. The strap went around her waist, and she tested her buoyancy. Unlike SCUBA tanks, IRIS didn't change in buoyancy. And it weighed about the same as a typical weight belt. More than 30 patents applied for, integrated into their baby. All but 6 of them hers. Of course the big two, the game changers, were Cam's. 

 She looked over at Cam, and saw his big grin. When he was playing with Iris, he always seemed like a big kid, the day-to-day stress all but absent, a different man exposed. The guy she'd met that first evening, arguing until dawn, designing a miracle on the back of a dozen napkins at iHOP. Who she'd rarely seen since. 

 "Iris, Channel 1. Stop." 

 Channel 1 active, Sierra. It always gave her goosebumps to hear her own voice, talking back to her. 

 "All systems go, Bossman?" she asked. Her voice was modulated and transferred to his unit. 

 "Ready, Patent-Lady. You wanna lead?" 

 "And have you stare at my butt for the next hour? I don't think so, perv." 

 He laughed. "Pull up alongside. Set a heading for 205Â°, 200 meters out. We'll head south from there." 

 "Got it." 

 "Iris-" she heard him speak, before he was silenced. Addressing Iris cut off the communications automatically during any commands. 

 "Iris, heading 205, distance 200 meters. Tracking Channel 1. Map lower quadrant, 400 meters, centered. Stop." She still occasionally forgot to say 'stop', after her commands. She knew the automatic command cutoff would kick in after 3 seconds of silence, but she preferred the precision of doing it right. Plus, the automatic command cutoff had been Cam's idea, and she hated giving him the satisfaction of using it. 

 Heading 205 set. 200 meter waypoint. Channel 1 in green, Sierra. 

 The map showed up in the bottom right of her mask, where a glance downward showed her placement on the map, as well as Cameron's and their target. 

 Swimming forward, she could see him out of the corner of her eye. The ultra- wide viewing area covered almost her entire face. Unlike a normal mask, the entire underwater world opened before her, a stunning panoramic view. She noticed movement to her left. "Cam, on our left." 

 He heard the "Cam, on our left," from Sierra, and it took a moment for him to differentiate it from Iris's responses. He looked that way. "Iris, identify." 

 The mask's AI tracked his eye movements, and one of the external cameras aimed at the moving object, zooming in, analyzing. Brackets surrounded the bright blue fish. Surgeonfish, Cam darling. The dark green brackets indicated more than 95% certainty. Knowing Sierra, that was probably closer to 99.9%. 

 'Darling?' He'd have to give Sy hell. He'd already warned her about Iris's flirting. Later. 

 "Beautiful," he said. 

 It was different in the water. They both knew it. They were like proud parents, and every argument, every dispute, ever little irritation disappeared. They had done this. Created it from scratch. Sierra felt his hand brush against hers. She opened her fingers, and his palm met hers, fingers interlocking, as they glided through the water in perfect sync. 

 They spent the hour they'd planned on, returning to their suite with 20% battery reserves, plus the 5 minute emergency compressed oxygen tank unspent. A glorious hour spent underwater, exploring their surroundings, and testing Iris's abilities. 

 Sierra pulled up to the dock, bracing herself with one hand. "Iris, thank you. Save recording. Save data. End dive." 

 You're welcome. Dive archived, visuals and data. Have a wonderful day, Sierra. 

 She pulled off her mask, and set it on the wooden deck, unstrapped the pack, and placed it beside Cameron's. She looked over at him, sure that her smile was at least as large as his. 

 Her legs kicked casually, keeping her high in the water, while they grinned at each other. They didn't need to say a word. It had been perfect. Sublime. He moved closer, and she leaned into him, accepting his embrace. She'd known it was coming. There was something about being in the water with Iris that broke down their barriers. In this idyllic setting, it felt stronger than ever. 

 "Thank you," he whispered, slipping his arm around her body, their legs scissoring together, his thigh brushing between her legs. She saw something new in him, an emotionality she'd never expected. His eyes glistened, staring into hers. 

 "No, Cameron. I should be thanking you. There's a million computer jockeys out there that could have done this. I'll never be able to thank you enough for letting me be part of it." 

 "Bullshit, Sy. No matter what else there is between us, there's no denying the perfect synergy we share. I couldn't have done it without you, and I doubt there are a dozen people in the country that could have accomplished what you have. Iris is pure genius." 

 Their bodies were pressed together, faces only inches apart. The constant movement of his leg between hers was driving her crazy. She could tell from the bulge in his suit, that her leg moving between his was doing the same. They were always close after each test, but this - this was different. They had done it. Achieved perfection in as much as anyone could. Fuck the world if they couldn't recognize it. Fuck Devereaux if he didn't have the vision. If they had nothing else, they had this moment. And they had Iris. 

 Cameron's gaze was intense, burning. "Si, I know I promised no shenanigans, but I need to kiss you now." 

 Before she could respond his lips were on hers, desperate, passionate, his teeth crushing her lip, his tongue fighting with hers. She felt his thigh pressed deep between her legs, no longer moving, only his exterior leg kicking, keeping them afloat. Hers was positioned the same, feeling his need pressed against her flesh. She closed her eyes, surrendering to the moment. It had nothing to do with their honeymoon cover, or the teasing playfulness of earlier. It was right. An extension of their perfect time together with Iris. 

 When he pulled away an eternity later, she felt his hand caress his face, before she opened her eyes. His conveyed concern. "I'm sorry, Sierra. That was unacceptable behavior on my part. I can only plead temporary insanity. Please forgive me." 

 She smiled. "A shared insanity, Cam. It's Iris." 

 "I know. Still-" 

 "Gimme a kiss, hubby dear, and you're forgiven." 

 She enjoyed the grin on his face, as he leaned in and gave her a teasing little kiss, which lasted only a couple of seconds. "Forgiven?" he asked. 

 "Always. I don't think I'll ever be able to stay mad at the father of our girl, not for long." 

 They moved apart, and made their way to the ladder. Cameron watched Sierra climb up first, hoping a few moments respite would hide the evidence of just how strongly the last few minutes had affected him. He felt guilty, for pressing the limits, beyond what he'd promised. By the time he climbed out, he wasn't too embarrassed. They rinsed themselves off, and their gear, put the batteries on the charger, and connected the Iris units to the computer, dumping the results of their test.  

 

 ****** F3 Anything for Iris ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© "I'm gonna shower," Sierra announced, picking some clothing out of the dresser. 

 Cameron was about to joke if she needed any help, but felt he'd already pressed things way to far already. Not that he wouldn't love to help her, but that wasn't their agreement. "Take your time, I'm gonna check on our surveillance." 

 He had a powerful high-def camera targeted on the bungalow across the way. The resolution was enough that he could zoom in on any area, and read the cover of a book. Not quite newsprint legible definition, but more than enough for their needs. A parabolic reflector was aimed at the deck, while laser microphones targeted the bedroom and bath. He crossed the room and adjusted the optical receiver. Everything seemed to be working, and he set the system on auto. 

 Sitting at the laptop, he reviewed the data from their dive, putting it through a series of filters, analyzing the oxygen content, water flow rate, battery drain, Iris responses. All seemed to be within typical norms. He still had a nagging hunch that part of the euphoric feeling that each test resulted in was partially due to the high-oxygen content of the rebreather, or some similar effect of the scrubbed gasses. He was tempted to put the max batteries into the system, allowing a 2.5 hour swim, and see if there was any change. Sixty minutes was still their max test, but sooner or later they'd have to check out longer duration dives, and empty the batteries to the point where the artificial gills shut down, until they were reliant on the spare oxygen tank. They didn't have enough mini-tanks to do that more than once. 

 "Presentable?" Cameron heard from behind. He turned and gave his 'wife' a wolf whistle. "Gorgeous, Sierra. You really need to wear dresses more often. You'd scare the hell out of the guys in the lab." 

 She blushed at his teasing. "Your turn. Our friends show up yet?" 

 "Not a sign of them. I thought they were supposed to be here before dinner. I hope we don't lose a day." 

 Sierra walked past him, looking at the computer display. "Air traffic can be a tricky thing. It's still barely 3:00 o'clock, but I'm regretting skipping lunch. Get cleaned up, and let's see if we can't get fed somewhere." 

 As soon as he was out of the chair, Sierra was seated, doing her own analysis, checking out Iris's voice recognition accuracy. Near perfect, of course, but both Cam and she were the voice standards. She only hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Devereaux didn't stray much from the baseline. She realized that if they could catch the couple speaking on the deck, she could record their voices and 'train' Iris with them, minimizing last minute voice practice. 

 With the data verified, she retreated to the open deck to relax. Her second glass of champagne, and she was already feeling a buzz. The situation probably had something to do with her giddy feeling. It really was paradise. No bugs, ideal weather, warm water, and the gorgeous scenery. It was more than she could have imagined. Her first time out of the country, and it was to the Maldives, at a luxury resort. She had to hand it to Cam, if you were going to risk it all, why not do it in style? 

 She looked over in the direction of the corner bathroom, and was surprised to see he'd opted for using the bathtub. The tub was conspicuously located at the edge of the bathroom, surrounded on three sides by floor to ceiling windows. She watched as he stood up, the water dripping off his naked form, giving her a good view of his backside. She giggled, wondering if any of the suites across the way were getting the full Monty. 

 "Not bad," she murmured to herself, checking out his tight butt, and muscular back. 

 She reached down and adjusted her panties, where they crept up her crack. She had no idea what had driven her to wear a thong. She'd never liked them. Uncomfortable as hell. Yet her simple sundress practically screamed at her to wear one. She'd almost dredged up the courage to go braless. Almost. 

 "It'll do," she heard a powerful voice echo across the water. She was surprised how well it carried. She looked over, and started scrambling. Target acquisition, the Devereaux's had landed. 

 She tested the parabolic mic and found the gain too high. She turned it down, and listened in. 

 "What do you think," the man's voice from earlier spoke. 

 "It's not the Waldorf, but it's not bad," a soft, sultry voice answered. Sierra's hand automatically went to the amplifier, adjusting the equalizer. 

 "What's up?" Cameron's voice boomed from behind her. She glanced up and her heart leapt into her throat, when she saw the faces on the far deck turn their way. The zoom on the display instantly captured a look of distaste. 

 "You, I hope," she said loudly. 

 She bounded out of the chair, turning and leaping into his arms. He caught her before he could be bowled over, and trembled when her lips settled over his. She kissed him hard, her eyes open, staring into his, a look of... fear? 

 He pushed her face away. "What the-" 

 Her hand was over his mouth cutting him off. He felt her lips against his ear. "They're here. On the deck. They can hear everything we say. Sound carries like mad across the water." 

 Cameron leaned his head to the side, sliding his lips over hers, kissing her softly, while peeking over her shoulder. Sure enough. Alan Devereaux, in the flesh, gazing their way, his wife Janine tucked under his arm. The couple stood at the railing, openly watching them. 

 This wasn't how it was supposed to happen. He felt the air across his body. He'd dropped his towel when Sierra had surprised him. Here he was naked as the day he was born, standing with a hard-on, in front of their last hope. His mind was clicking away, while his mouth stayed connected to Sierra's, gaining a few moments to think. 

 He looked again, and was surprised to see that Janine was standing in front of Devereux, his arms draped around her, his hands on her chest, while they both watched intently. 

 Cameron reached up and grabbed the zipper at the top of her dress in back, and pulled it down. He almost stopped when Sierra bit his lip. "Stop!" she hissed. 

 "They're watching. Please go along just a bit. Trust me, Sy." 

 Sierra trembled, as the zipper slid down her back. Then she felt it falling, leaving her exposed, standing in the open, in only her bra and panties. Not even panties, for that matter. That stupid thong. 

 She had her head tucked into his shoulder, mortified. The way he was exposing her. She was having difficulty breathing. She could feel their eyes on her, looking, judging. Taking in her skinny boy-butt. Sierra gasped as Cameron's hand slid down her body, caressing her flesh. She moaned, unable to prevent it. She was burning up, her nipples diamond hard, trying to tear their way through her sheer bra. 

 "Please," she whimpered. 

 "Beg me," Cameron pronounced loudly, looking across the way. Janine Devereaux was topless, leaning into her husband's hands. 

 "Cam, please, please!" 

 He laughed, and scooped her into his arms, as if she was weightless. "Wave to the neighbors beautiful," he told her. 

 She was shaking, heart racing, face flushed. She'd never been so embarrassed, nor so excited. She was afraid they could smell her excitement from across the water. She lifted a hand and waved, head turned away in shame. She didn't see Alan Devereaux's cheerful wave back, but Cameron did. 

 Sierra was helpless and she knew it. She was all but naked and she could feel Cameron's hardness pressed against her hip. She moaned, turning her head, kissing his chest, as he carried her to the bed, their bed. She shivered, wondering how he'd be. Impersonal, like the lab, playful, like they were during the sea test, intimate, powerful, dominant, demanding. Which Cameron would it be? 

 She was on her back, raising her hips, waiting for him to strip off that damned thong. She opened her eyes, and saw him sit beside her, draping a towel over her exposed body. He leaned into her, holding her softly, his faint words butterfly kisses against her ear. "I'm so sorry, Sierra. They were watching. We're supposed to be newlyweds. I didn't know what else to do." 

 Do? she thought. He should have... She trembled, gasping, at the thoughts that ran through her mind. Surely, she didn't want, not like that, not in front of them. Not with him. 

 Cameron, held her gently. "I'm sorry, Sy. I'm sorry." 

 Part of her wanted to roll into his embrace, let him calm her, forgive him for exposing her like that. Another part wanted to slap him, while another, the scariest, wanted to deride him for not being man enough to see what she wanted. Needed. 

 She needed to take back control. She couldn't collapse like this. Not in front of him. She pushed him away. "What are we supposed to be doing in here?" She asked softly, glancing in the direction of the Devereaux's suite. 

 It was her turn to watch him blush. She glared at him. "Grab that chair and sit. Don't move," she hissed. 

 As he moved off the bed, pulling over the chair, and sitting on it, she noticed he'd lost his hardness for her. 

 That wouldn't do. 

 She moaned loudly, "Ohhh, baby." She reached under the towel covering her, and removed her bra, pulling it out from the oversized beach towel, and throwing it in Cam's direction. 

 "That's it. Suck my titties, baby. Yessss!" she groaned loudly, her hands moving under the towel, the action obvious to Cameron, where the cotton cloth tented over her chest. 

 He wasn't the only one that could put on a show. 

 "Bite it. Don't be gentle. Claim me. For always." She pinched her own nipple hard, gasping, crying out softly. 

 She opened her eyes, and caught Cameron stroking his new erection. She glared at him, mouthing a harsh "No!" He pulled his hands away, and she smiled. She was back in control. She'd teach that bastard to use her like that. Expose her. Get her worked up and leave her hanging? Let's see how he liked it. 

 "I need it Cam, baby. Inside me, stretching me," she cried out. "Don't make me beg again. Please. Fuck me, baby. Fuck me." She gazed down at his erection. Not huge, but definitely above average. Not that she was surprised. As if there was anything average about Cameron Riddle. 

 Her hands pulled her soaked thong aside, rubbing her wetness, teasing herself, just like she was teasing him, torturing him. Punishing him for exposing her like that. For getting her worked up, and leaving her high and dry. 

 Well, maybe not that dry. 

 "Whatever you want, I swear, just fuck me. Fuck me!" she cried out. 

 She shrieked, knowing she'd be heard in every suite up and down the walkway. She closed her eyes, imagining Cameron on top of her, seconds after they'd left the balcony, in her moment of weakness. He could have had her then, she couldn't have stopped him. Wouldn't have. Sierra slid two fingers into her depths, crying out, moaning loudly. 

 "Like that, Fuck me, you animal!" she groaned. "Beast." 

 Frustrated, she brought up her knees, and tore off her thong, throwing it across the room. Heedless that the towel barely covered her waist, her tiny tits exposed to his view, her nipples standing tall, one leg free of the towel, exposed to the hip. 

 "Fuck me, Cam," she groaned. "Fuck me, fuck me. FUCK. ME!" 

 She closed her eyes, leaning back into the pillow, both hands working now, one rubbing, one probing, the wet sound of her own desperate desire the only sound in the room, beside her heavy breathing and groans. 

 She fell into a rhythm, her actions interspersed with loud moans, and abjurations to give it to her harder, deeper, faster. On and on she abused herself, time drifting away, her surroundings no longer relevant. 

 Sierra's moans grew in intensity, the burning feeling blocking out everything. Her legs hurt from being too tense for so long. Her hips were bouncing off the bed. She wanted to come, needed to come, needed it so bad. She strained, crying in her need, shaking. 

 "Come, Sy. Come for me." 

 She opened her eyes, seeing him beside her. He adjusted the towel to cover her, providing that littlest remaining shred of privacy. "Come, baby. Come for me." 

 His voice was stronger than necessary, putting on a show, but his gaze, his eyes locked on hers, his hand moving up and down his turgid staff, proved it was more than that. His other hand caressed her cheek, burning where it touched. 

 Sierra was going crazy, her fingers a blur, but the ending was just out of reach. She groaned, tears of frustration flooding her eyes. "I... I can't." She couldn't believe her own words when she gasped, "Help me?" 

 His stare pierced her. He lay down beside her, and she moaned when his hand left his cock and slid under the towel. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her near hand free, her fingers soaked in her juices. He brought them upward, staring into her eyes, as he smelled them, breathing in deeply. She felt his hardness pressed against her thigh, rubbing against her, searing her sensitive skin. She felt a wetness, sliding against her hip, and sensed his desperate need. 

 "Come for me, Sierra, my beautiful wife," he whispered, only for her. His mouth opened, sliding her fingers between his lips. Sucking. 

 Sierra felt the jolt through her spine. She screamed, her hips reaching for the ceiling, the towel cast aside, her hand clutching between her legs, trying to stem the flood. Her body shook, and she clutched at him as he took her in his arms, holding her tightly, his hand caressing her, possessing her. She cried out again, feeling his warm juices bathing her hip, where he ground his hard cock against her. The stifled whimper that leaked from his lips set her world on fire. 

 His arms, his chest, his smell, that was her world, and she wanted nothing to interfere with it. Time ceased to exist in her isolated fantasy world, where she was his, without restraint, without remorse. She felt movement, shifting, as her lips pressed against his chest. She curled up tighter, a little naked ball in his powerful arms. His calm caresses slowly opened her up. She let her knees edge away from her belly, for the moment embarrassed at how exposed she must have been, curled up like that. She looked up at him and saw his concerned face. It blocked out the sky, and she realized they were out on the deck. It took her a few moments to get her bearings, and she was thankful her head was pointed toward the Devereaux's suite. 

 "Are they..." she whispered. 

 "Yes. Enthralled. You're one hell of a woman, Mrs. Riddle." 

 She curled up tighter, leaning against him, both terrified and satisfied. 

 "I'm embarrassed," she whispered, her finger tracing patterns on his chest. 

 "I know. It's ok." His hand brushed back her hair, and he leaned down and kissed her forehead. "Let's get you inside and taken care of." 

 He stood, holding her easily, and returned inside without a glance at the other suite. 

 Cam was gentle with her, placing her on the bed, and covering her with one of the oversized towels. He brushed her hair back, grinning at her. "I think they'll accept our cover now." 

 Sierra felt awkward and nervous. She was naked and extremely embarrassed over her performance. "Can you give me a minute alone, Cam?" 

 He leaned over and kissed her forehead gently. "Take as long as you need. We'll get something to eat if that's alright. Dinner should be starting shortly, and I'll call and get us a seat at Velhi. I think a quiet evening away from the buffet would be best." 

 Sierra only then realized he was still nude. He stopped by his dresser, slipped on a pair of shorts and a Hawaiian shirt before disappearing into the bathroom. She heard the bathtub filling, before he returned. 

 "The bath is heavenly. I've run the water for you. When you're ready, I'll be out on the deck." 

 A twenty minute soak had her feeling a little more in control of her situation. She reclined amid the bubbles and bath oils, staring out through the window at the distant suites. In a moment of nervousness, she looked back through the window toward the balcony, but could only see the back and side of Cam's head, where he appeared to be relaxing in the nearest lounge chair. She still couldn't believe her behavior, blaming it on the situation, the excitement of Iris's testing going so well, the champagne, and the atmosphere of the place. 

 "What must he think of me?" she wondered, as she dried off, tying her hair back in a simple pony-tail. 

 Sierra was not one to wear makeup, but she applied a little lipstick and perfume. She found her dress, which she'd worn for a short while earlier, laid out on the bed, along with her thong. Her bra was notably absent. Sandals were placed at the foot of the bed. 

 She grinned. Cocky son-of-a-bitch, picking out her wardrobe. She was tempted to ignore it, but she knew that would let him know he was getting to her. She swapped out the sandals for a different pair, but stuck with his choice of clothing. She was surprised she didn't feel more awkward, dressing in the bedroom, which was open to the deck. All he had to do was turn his head to see her. 

 "Not like that would be anything new, now," she thought, adjusting her dress. She looked in the mirror, trying to decide if she really dared go out without a bra. Her breasts were small, admittedly, barely a B cup, but her nipples were large and sensitive. They were already hardening from feeling the soft material brush against them. 

 "Hell, I'm a honeymooner, right? Newlywed?" She turned and looked at herself in the mirror. "If the guys in the lab could see me now..." 

 She walked out on the deck, and Cam nearly fell over, jumping out of the chair. He gave an instinctive look across the water, where she could hear a gentle rumble of muted conversation, but nobody was visible. 

 "Damn, you clean up nice, Sy. You're stunning." 

 She walked up to him, offering her cheek for a kiss. "Nobody's watching. You don't have to suck up." 

 Cam grabbed her chin, and turned her face forward, kissing her on the lips. Nothing too egregious, but nice, nonetheless. "Honest to God, Sierra. You're gorgeous. Every man on the island's going to be jealous of me." 

 She blushed, and was surprised to find her hand sliding up his side in appreciation. "You dress down nice. You should go casual more often. Dress suits and wet suits are all I ever see you in." 

 "No suits on this trip," he told her, his hands nearly encircling her narrow waist. "Shall we go? If you'd rather, we could have food brought in." 

 She shook her head. "I think we need to make an appearance. Make it look right. We're around, but not interested in socializing." 

 "Works for me." He put his arm around her waist, guiding her out the door, onto the long wooden dock that connected the suites to the main island. Once out the door, he slid his hand down to hers. 

 "For show?" she teased, wiggling her hand in his. 

 "If you insist," he said softly. "Iris was perfect today." 

 "Unbelievable. I know we had updated the marine charts and marine life tables, but I didn't expect that!" she exclaimed, leaning into him. 

 His hand casually released hers, his arm rising up her back, his hand warm on her bare shoulder. "Not one miss. We must have seen 40 different types of marine life, and she nailed them all." 

 "Thirty nine fish, two sharks, and 22 types of coral and plants," she corrected him. 

 "I didn't think it was possible. I mean, seriously, the interpretation from a photo to the real thing? I was praying for a 50/50 hit rate." 

 She giggled. "You think so little of me?" 

 Sierra was surprised when he stopped abruptly, turning her and pulling her into his arms. "Hardly. You are without a doubt the most exceptional woman I've ever met, and a genius with your AI." 

 She braced herself for the kiss, when his face lowered toward hers. His lips glided past her mouth, brushing her cheek along the way. "We have an audience," he whispered, nibbling her ear. "At the concierge area."  

 

 ****** F3 Anything for Iris ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© His mouth moved back to hers, kissing her deeply, pulling her body close, one arm clutching her body, the other hand settling over her butt cheek, massaging it. 

 She leaned into him, feeling his hardness pressing against her belly. It made her feel good, that she could get to him like that. "Mmm," she whispered, once she could free her lips. "Somebody's happy," she teased, turning and pressing her hip into his erection. 

 He gave her a quick kiss, and turned to walk down the path, pulling her close, his hand around her shoulders. "Beyond happy. Ecstatic. It's coming together, Sy. I can feel it. And there's nobody I'd rather share it with than my incredible wife." 

 Sierra bumped her shoulder against him. "Enjoy it while you can, Bossman. In five days you turn back into a pumpkin, and I'm gonna be wielding the carving knife if you don't start behaving yourself." 

 * * * 

 They were early for dinner, in the upscale Velhi restaurant. It required reservations and had limited space, but their choice of accommodations gave them VIP status, and their wristband ensured priority seating. As "newlyweds" the staff had orders to ensure their special treatment. The combination had them seated in one of the six window tables, looking over the beach, across the Indian Ocean. 

 "It's beautiful here," Cameron said, gazing across the water. 

 "You ever done something like this before?" 

 He looked over at his dinner companion. "Go on a honeymoon?" 

 She rolled her eyes at him. "Go someplace like this. Tropical paradise, all- inclusive, first-class." 

 He chuckled. "I'm lucky to get down to Ocean City for a weekend. I think my biggest adventure since I've been on my own was four days in Manhattan. Not quite the same, I think. You?" 

 "Panama City Beach for spring break, probably." 

 "C'mon, Sierra, I know you've been out to the Big Island twice." 

 "Four to a room, fly in, swim, bike, run, recuperate for a day, then stagger to Kona for the flight home. Not really relaxing." She sipped her cocktail. "Between training and triathlons, all my free time is taken. Iris doesn't leave much time for much else." 

 Cameron nodded. They shared that. The all encompassing nature of their business. Every spare minute working on their masterpiece. "You love it too, don't you?" he said. 

 Sierra was quiet for a moment. "More than I suspect anyone but you could imagine." 

 "You remember our first 'date'?" 

 She laughed. "Is that what you're going to call it? If so, you were the lousiest date in history. All we did was argue and fight for, what, like 14, 15 hours?" 

 He grinned, "And out of that feisty union, Iris was conceived." 

 She looked up at him, the only person in the world who could understand what that meant. Two more initial meetings, and she'd quit her job, and dedicated herself full time to the Iris project. Almost three years of her life, chewing through her savings, emptying her 401K, maxing out her credit cards. Virtually every waking moment was spent thinking about Iris. And she knew she hadn't put a tenth of what Cameron had into the project. 

 She gave him a smile. "Best date ever." She leaned across the table. "What are we going to do if this doesn't work out?" she whispered. 

 "We keep trying. I'll get a paying gig if I have to. Consult. Beg family and friends. Maybe sell a kidney. What we don't do is give up." 

 "Never give in," she whispered, her eyes moistening. "Never give in, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense." 

 Cameron held his other hand out for her, and she placed hers in it. He gave them a squeeze. "You'll fight with me, won't you Sy?" 

 Her voice was hoarse with emotion, as she nodded. "I'll go to war if I have to. As long as it takes, whatever it takes, for as long as I'm standing or breathing. Beyond conviction and good sense. I swear Cam, I won't let you down. Never. Never, never, never." 

 "And that's what I love about you, Sierra." 

 To the tables around them, slowly filling up, they were the picture of love. Eyes only for each other, whispering, smiling, holding hands. At the table for ten, the senior directors of Devereaux holdings sat. Janine nudged her husband, nodding toward the couple at the window. "Remember what it was like?" she whispered. 

 He leaned toward her, putting his arm around her shoulders, and kissed her cheek. "Every night, my love. Every single night." 

 She blushed, putting her hand on his thigh and giving it a squeeze. They'd been together since the beginning, fresh out of college. She remembered when he was working out of their basement, bringing four of his friends together. Janine dealt with all the finances, somehow finding the money for their first prototypes. Going hat in hand to their relatives, pitching their ideas, borrowing a hundred dollars here, fifty there. Living off Ramen and $.88 loaves of generic sandwich bread. Working 50 hours a week, to pay their bills, while he dedicated himself to their dream. Those were tough years. 

 She looked around, still barely able to conceive how far they'd come. When they had their first IPO, she was scared. The money was fairy-tale numbers. Alan was in demand everywhere, traveling, being courted. Would she lose him, to some new chippy? Younger, prettier, willing to do whatever it took to capture his attention. 

 Yet here she was, beside her man, almost 20 years later. She gazed on the younger couple, their villa neighbors, the poster-kids for young love. She silently prayed that their lives ended up even half as wonderful as hers had. 

 Alan tore his attention away from the parasites, the suck-ups, the beggars at his table. Presidents of major corporations. Millionaires in their own right, eager to latch onto his coat tails, so long as he had the magic touch. He watched his woman, seeing the wistful smile on her face, making his heart swell. He pressed his lips to her ear. "I love you just as much, more if it's possible. Without you, I'm a pauper." 

 Janine turned, grabbed her husband's face in her hands, and kissed him desperately. The hell with convention and propriety! 

 Across the room, Sy and Cam had noticed when their targets had entered the restaurant. For the most part they ignored them, all part of the plan. They weren't supposed to know anything about them. They were merely newlyweds, with eyes for nobody but each other. When they heard the laughter and cheering from the table, the turned to see their targets kissing like teenagers. They separated, gazing into each other's eyes, before turning back toward the table. Janine looked up, and caught the newlyweds watching them. 

 'Beat that,' she thought, smiling. 

 Sierra raised her glass in their direction, and Janine lifted hers, winking at the new bride. 

 Cameron had no idea what was coming, when Sierra stood, leaned across the table, grabbed his head, and curled his toes with the best kiss of his life. Their waiter stood patiently by, ready to deliver their food. Sierra slowly pulled away, smiling at her stunned table companion. She shook her hair out, and sat down, immensely satisfied with herself. 

 Cam barely caught his breath, before the waiter was placing their dishes in front of them. He glanced at the man's nametag. "Sorry... Aryanta." 

 The man smiled. "No need sir. I would wait all night before interrupting. Your joy fills the room. I'm pleased to be allowed to serve you." 

 Once he'd left, Cam leaned toward Sierra. "What was that?" 

 She grinned, snagging one of the shrimp from his plate. "Woman's prerogative. You complaining?" 

 Cam shook his head quickly. No doubt about it. Sierra was full of surprises. 

 * * * 

 After dinner, they made an appearance at the bar, passing on the nightly entertainment. They stayed just long enough to be seen, sharing some huge fruity drink. 

 "I need some air," Sierra said, her hand clinging to Cam's arm. "It seems like I've been drinking all day. I don't drink this much in a month." 

 He pulled out his roll of crisp dollars, peeling off a few and leaving them for a tip. Everything was paid for, part of the all-inclusive, with a few exceptions. Still tipping was encouraged, and they left just enough to be seen as generous without being eccentric. He took his tipsy 'bride' by her hand, and guided her to the beach. 

 A half-hour walk around the tiny island had them back to their end. Cameron was surprised at the presence of the security guards throughout. Stepping onto the dock that lead out to the VIP suites, a short dark man stepped forward and stopped them, asking to check their wristbands. He was extremely courteous. 

 He carefully studied their faces. "Sorry to interrupt your walk," he said with a British accent. "I will remember you, and won't need to disturb you again. May I inquire which suite you are in?" 

 They gave him the number, pointing in their direction. He nodded politely. "Have a pleasant evening," he offered, stepping out of their way. 

 Once they were past the concierge building, Sierra nudged closer to Cam. "Extra security for Devereaux?" 

 "There may be, but I don't think that was the case here. They're just keeping the hoi-poloi away from their betters," he teased. 

 "Their betters? We're probably the poorest people on the island, help included," Sierra laughed. 

 "Not as long as we have Iris, we're not." 

 In the suite, they got down to business. They started checking out the surveillance of the Devereaux' suite. "Anything good on your end?" Sierra asked. 

 "Some news. He's going to be in meetings all day, but it looks like she has a spa appointment at 10:00." 

 "Let me guess. That would be a good time for me to have one as well." 

 "Bingo. You could show up early, have some 'accidental' chat time. We'll meet for lunch afterward, in the regular restaurant." 

 "How do you think it's going?" Sierra asked nervously. 

 "Pretty damn good. We got the right suite, they've seen us around. Now we just need to a few opportunities to be sociable. Don't think we could ask for much more on day one." 

 Half an hour later, they'd made her spa appointment, and had gotten all they could off their recordings. They deleted everything they had, and verified the recorders were still active. Neither wanted to talk about the elephant in the room. Bedtime. 

 Cam went out to the deck, and took a seat. Sierra followed moments later, relaxing in the lounge chair. "You know what I'd like to do?" Cam said. 

 "I'm afraid to ask," Sierra laughed. 

 The sun was setting, the sky a panorama of reds, yellows, indigo and gold. A blue glow was rimming the posts, where the phosphorescent algae glowed. The warm breeze was blowing in from the right, and the music from the resort bar was faint in the background. "I'd like to go for a swim." 

 "Iris?" 

 "Of course. So? What do you think?" 

 Sierra smiled. "I'll never say no to Iris." 

 "You get ready, I'll get the gear," Cam offered. 

 Cam loaded the recharged batteries into Iris, and tested the connections. He ran through the diagnostics, and checked the results. With everything ready, he placed the pair of units on the water access deck, and waited for Sierra. 

 She showed up a few minutes later, wearing only a plain white t-shirt, and bikini bottoms. Cam was reminded of Jacqueline Bisset in the Deep. 

 "Your turn," she said. "Everything ready?" 

 "Yeah, but I imagine you're going to want to do your own diagnostics." He headed in, taking off his shirt, while she laughed. 

 "Of course. Never trust a man to do a woman's job." 

 He returned minutes later, with his trunks on. Sierra was already in the water, putting on her mask. Cam put on his pack, placed his mask over his face, and slid into the water, holding the mask in place. He submerged a moment, seeing Sierra's breasts outlined against her t-shirt, as he surfaced. 

 He went through the pre-dive setup, while Sierra swam around the area around their hut. Moments later he was swimming beside her. "Where to?" he asked over the comm. 

 "No place particular for me," Sierra answered. 

 "Swim by our neighbors?" 

 "Not too close." 

 The water was magical. The dying sun let little light through, but with a single command, their dual spotlights came on. It reduced their dive time by 30%, but this was only going to be a short one anyway. The neon blue phosphorescence around them, glowing with each movement gave their swim a fantasy feeling. 

 "Iris, Map overlay, lower right quadrant, stop." 

 Map overlay active, 50 meters, centered on current position, Sierra. 

 The layout of their end of the resort showed up on the glass, her position a green dot. "Iris, plot Cam on the map, stop." 

 Cam darling plotted, Sierra. 

 A Blue dot showed up, blending with hers to make teal where the two collided. 

 She heard Cam's voice. "On our right." She looked over and saw a huge manta, flying through the water, its movements deceptively slow and easy as it glided along a few feet below them, skimming the bottom. 

 Between the islands the water was no deeper than about 20 feet. The deep channel access to the interior of the ring of islands was at the far end of the island. They didn't have to worry about their depths, or equalizing. They stayed in a range of about 5' to 15' feet the whole time. That was ideal. The deeper they went, the less efficient Cam's artificial gills were. Even the air scrubber had to work harder. Iris wasn't designed for depths, and her usefulness dropped drastically after about 60 feet. 

 They hadn't seen much life at first. Then Cam's voice appeared. "Sy, sonar, high, spotlight 10, dim 20%." 

 After working with Cameron day and night for three years, she understood his shorthand speak. He only got that way when excited. The first time she'd heard him rattle off his cryptic commands, she'd taken a moment to figure out what he needed, while those around them froze. She'd immediately taken action. It had been a close call, but it save the test. She didn't hesitate now. 

 "Iris, activate sonar, max sensitivity, overlay map. Main headlamp, spotlight mode, full power, autolock on 10 meter movement, largest active target. Secondary headlamp, floodlight mode, 20% power. Stop." 

 Her world changed in an instant. The underwater scene before her dimmed, and she was swimming in a dim environ, Cam's glow from beside her providing little more light than hers. She saw a beam of light piercing the dark beside her, and movement at the end of it. 

 Sonar active, main headlamp spotlight mode, locked on largest movement. Alt headlamp flood mode at 20%, Sierra. 

 The spotlight from her unit reached out to team with Cam's. Under the dual rays, not 10 feet away, she saw a huge sea turtle moving across their front. "Iris, identify target." 

 Hawksbill sea turtle, Eretmochelys Imbricata, critically endangered, Sierra. 

 She felt him rubbing against her shoulder, and she reached out. His hand took hers automatically, and they adjusted their swim rate. "I love this," she spoke softly. 

 "Magical," Cam answered. 

 They turned in unison, following the turtle a short distance, its grace in the water stunning. She saw movement at the edge of their spotlight for a moment. "Iris, secondary target, identify. Stop." 

 Her spotlight shifted, illuminating a huge fish. Titan triggerfish. Aggressive. Keep your distance, Sierra. 

 Sierra, tugged on Cam's hand, slowing him. "Nesting triggerfish, Cam. Our girl says it's aggressive." It must have been almost three feet long. They veered away from it, and continued their exploration of their environs, allowing Iris to pick out and show them the unbelievable world that was theirs alone. 

 One of the more fascinating aspects of allowing Iris to pick out their targets, was her ability to find camouflaged fish, like the stonefish and leaf scorpionfish, which they would never have spotted on their own. They had to get within about three feet to see the stonefish Iris assured them was there, it was hidden so well. The perimeter of her mask flashed red. 

 Warning. Proximity alert. Synanceia verrucosa is highly poisonous, Sierra. 

 No kidding. Only the most venomous fish in the world. Lethal. "Thank you, Iris." 

 She looked over, and saw Cam watching her. She grinned and made an act of covering up her breasts. "Perv, watch the show." 

 "I am. The most beautiful thing out here." 

 She blushed, and pulled away, heading back in the general direction of their suite. She tugged on his hand, pulling him along. 

 "Tomorrow night, full batteries, Ok? I'd like to go from just before sunset until it's pitch black. See how the lights hold up," Sierra said. 

 "You got it." 

 A few minutes later Cam spoke up. "You think you could hook up a link to our camera in the house? Video capture of what's going on at the Devereaux place?" 

 She thought about it for a bit. "I'd need a couple of hours. Have to tap the field trial upload link. Wouldn't work beyond maybe 100 yards, unless I used a directional signal. Can you handle that?" 

 She heard his chuckle. What a stupid question. Of course he could. "I'll deal with signal amplification and the directional transmitter. You set up the video feed and Iris's controls," she heard him answer. 

 "Works for me." She gave his hand a squeeze. "Helluva team, aren't we?" 

 "The best." 

 They ran a couple of laps by their neighbor's hut, not sure they were even around, but if they were, they thought they might garner a little attention. At the 40 minute mark, they headed back, with plenty of time to spare. 

 Sierra pulled up to the access deck of their villa on stilts, her pulse racing. Was it possible for their tests to get any better? Iris at dusk was even more incredible than by day! Seeking out water movement, automatically tracking by spotlight, keeping them safe. She automatically went through the motions of shutting down Iris, and stripping off the equipment, Cam at her side. 

 She turned to him, and saw the desire, a hunger that frightened her, and then he was on her. Their mouths met, no tentative request, no simple shared joy. His arm went around her waist, holding her close. She released the deck, hanging onto him, while his single hand kept them tethered. 

 Their legs were intertwined, slow short kicks keeping them floating, alternating the pressure against each other's privates. She lost herself in the kiss, lifting her hands when he tugged her shirt off, over her head. Her naked torso pressed against his, as her pulse soared. She could swear if they stayed in the water much longer, it would start to boil around them. 

 The intensity of the kiss faded, becoming more loving, then playful, and she melted into his strong arm, clinging to him. When they finally broke apart, their faces remained close, eyes locked on each others. "Incredible," he whispered. 

 She felt his erection pressed against her leg, and purposely moved against it. "Superb." 

 A smile twisted his lips. "We need better superlatives." 

 "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." 

 "Scrumpdilyicious," he countered. 

 "I know. Iris was beyond description." 

 His face moved forward, his mouth covering hers, his tongue reminding her of the moray eel they'd seen, darting out from its cave, beautiful and dangerous. She captured it with her own. She was the first to pull away this time. 

 "I was talking about you, Sy. Un-fucking-believable." He released her slowly, his hand rising out of the water to brush back a few stray strands of her hair. 

 She grinned. "We need to check the scrubbers. I think you're high. Iris is the star here. I'm just a distraction." 

 His smile slipped. "Don't do that." 

 "Do what?" 

 "Belittle yourself. Face it, Sy. You're the most incredible woman I've ever known. You've got it all." 

 "You're just horny," she teased. 

 "Stop it. Accept the compliment. How can you not see it?"  

 

 ****** F3 Anything for Iris ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© She drew away from him, headed toward the ladder. "Thanks, but you're full of crap, Cam. You're high off the dive, and the atmosphere." 

 Cam followed her up the steps, watching as she picked up her unit, rinsing it. He looked up, and saw they had an audience. Not quite as obvious as last time, but the Devereaux were definitely looking their way. He picked up his own unit, and felt Sierra shift away from him, when he went rinse off his gear. 

 "Don't," he whispered. "They're watching." 

 For a moment she thought he was using it as an excuse to push his little games. Only for a moment. Cameron wasn't like that, she knew. I brief glance sideways, and she saw their targets. "Don't get carried away, Cam." That was all she needed. Another show like before. 

 "Me get carried away? You're the once prancing around topless already." 

 Sierra couldn't believe she'd already forgotten about letting him take off her shirt. Too late to do much about that now. She put her Iris to the side, and stood under the outdoor shower, rinsing off the salt water. 

 Cam eased up behind her, his body pressed against hers, his hands sliding up and down her front. "Cam..." she hissed. 

 "Go with it, Sy. This is all, nothing crazy. Let me rinse you." 

 She stopped resisting, and leaned back against his chest, feeling his strong hands gliding across her skin, coming to rest on her breasts. She tried to tell him no, but all that escaped her lips was a moan. 

 "Best dive ever," he whispered in her ear. 

 "The best," she groaned, feeling his hand slide down the front of her bikini bottom, then slipping inside, rubbing her. His arm slid around her, over her shoulder, across her tits, grasping her under the armpit, pinning her to his body. She lifted her hands, hanging onto his arm, as he leaned away, arching her back. 

 She groaned, as his fingers penetrated her. "C...C...Cam," she gasped. 

 Then they were gone, making her feel empty. He spun her around, pulled her under the shower spray, and kissed her, the water splashing against their bodies, rivulets dripping down her face, entering her mouth, with his tongue. She put a hand out to steady herself against the wall when he moved downward, his hot mouth seeking out her aching nipples. Her body trembled, as he switched from side to side, tasting her, teasing her. He stood again, and gave her a tender kiss. "Think that convinced them?" he whispered, kissing her slender neck. 

 "Damn near convinced me," she said, running her fingers through his hair. 

 "Let's put the gear away. Believe it or not, I could use another drink." 

 "A double." 

 They went through the motions, removing the batteries, putting them on the chargers, performing the data dump to the laptop. The hung up the gear to dry. "I need a real shower. Gimme a couple of minutes?" Sierra said. 

 "Sure. I'll meet you out on the deck." 

 * * * 

 Across the way, Janine Devereaux watched the young couple appear out of the water, wearing some weird type of diving gear. The girl was already topless, as they moved underneath the outdoor shower. 

 "Our neighbors are back at it," she chuckled to her husband. 

 "What do you expect? They're on their honeymoon." 

 "Do you think she's pretty?" Janine asked, as the man turned the girl toward them, his hands moving up and down her body, rinsing off the sea water. You could tell by the way he held her, the way he touched her, that he was absolutely infatuated. 

 Alan looked over, seeing their actions in the last light of day. If the outside lights weren't on, he wouldn't have been able to see anything. "Pretty face. She's not half as gorgeous as my girl." 

 "Of course not. She's skinny as a rail, with hardly any curves at all, but there's something about her..." Janine whispered, when she heard the girl's moan echo across the water. It was scary how well sound carried out here. 

 "She's in love. It shows. They're lucky to have found each other." 

 "I want to send them over a gift." 

 "Janine, please don't meddle." 

 "Just something small, Alan. I promise. We don't even have to say who it came from," she pleaded. 

 Alan sighed, got up and returned with the phone. "Concierge is *99." 

 She reached up and pulled his face down. "I'm the luckiest girl in the world." 

 He kissed his wife. "Not half so lucky as me." 

 She chuckled, dialing the number. "You're right," she teased. "But I would bet the guy across the way would argue the matter." 

 "He'd be wrong. But he's on his honeymoon, so I'd cut him some slack. I wouldn't have him killed." 

 "Eddie? It's Janine Devereaux. Listen can you..." 

 * * * 

 Sierra shampooed her hair thoroughly, she'd always considered that her best feature. The most feminine part of her body. She didn't know where Cam got off, talking about her like she did. She had no illusions about what she looked like. She'd always been too skinny, a crazy metabolism that burned through anything she ate. Her tits were barely enough to tent a shirt, and her ass was so scrawny, she was lucky her pants stayed up. 

 She looked down. At least her legs weren't too bad. They actually had some shape to them. She avoided looking at her feet, her toes misshapen from the countless hours running, and crammed into cycling shoes. 

 She took the time to blow-dry her hair, and put on a hint of makeup. She brushed her teeth, fearful what her breath must be like. Then again, she hadn't noticed anything bad about Cameron's and she'd certainly had the opportunity to. 

 Stepping into the bedroom, she dropped her towel and considered what to wear. Peeking through the window, she saw movement on the far deck, through the sheer curtains. The show must go on. 

 She opened her drawer, and looked at the filmy material. The stark white lacey negligee wouldn't hide much, but it wasn't like her intended audience hadn't already seen everything. And the message it shouted was exactly what they needed. Feeling exceptionally naughty, she dug back into the drawer, pulling out the thigh high white stockings. She finished the look with her only heels, and retreated to the bathroom to put them on. She checked herself out in the mirror. Her tan flesh contrasted beautifully with the outfit. She shook out her hair, going for the slightly disheveled look. Sierra sighed. It would have to do. 

 A few drops of perfume, a generous helping of antiperspirant. Maybe a hint of eye shadow. Touch up the lipstick. She tucked her feet into the heels. That did the job, hiding her unsightly toes. Turning in front of the mirror, she sighed when she saw her flat ass. 

 She took a deep breath. It's as good as it's gonna get. Showtime. 

 * * * 

 Cameron answered the door while Sierra was showering and getting ready. Their suite steward wheeled in a cart. "On the deck?" he suggested. 

 "Sure. What is it? We didn't order anything." 

 "An anonymous gift," he said, looking pointedly across the water. 

 "If you get a chance, tell them thank you." He retrieved his wallet, and pulled out a few more of his slowly diminishing dollars. Nobody said the trip was going to be cheap. He tipped the man, and returned to the deck. 

 Champagne. He lifted the bottle, not recognizing the label. Pink flowers adorned the heavy clear bottle. "Perrier-Jouet, Belle Epoque, 2004." It wasn't Dom Perignon, the only fancy champagne he was familiar with, but he imagined it was pretty good. The gold box next to it, with the large gold bow, contained a dozen chocolate truffles. There was an envelope on the tray as well. 

 He stood as her heard Sierra approaching, and almost fell. "My God, Sierra..." 

 She smiled, walking around the lounge chairs away from him, turning away demurely. "You don't approve?" she pouted. 

 "Stunning, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen." 

 She smiled shyly, walking toward the railing. "I bet you say that to all the girls." 

 She noticed the tray, raising an eyebrow. She lowered her voice. "What are you up to?" her playful tone noticeably absent. "We can't afford this." 

 He stood, stepping toward her quickly. "A generous, anonymous gift. There's a card for you, as well." He said it loud enough to carry, turning slightly and giving a tiny nod toward the opposite villa. 

 "But we don't know anybody here? Why would anyone send us... Godiva? Perrier- Jouet? This is too much, Cam." 

 He took her in his arms, turning her, so they were side-on to the Devereaux. "One of your many admirers, I'm sure. I don't know how he found you here. I hope I don't have to kill this one." 

 She giggled. "You know damn well I only have one admirer. And I'm quite happy with that one. I think you're talking about your little groupies. If any of them tracked you down, I swear I'll scratch the bitch's eyes out. I'm not kidding either. I'll tear her apart and leave her for the fishes." 

 He tilted her head back, and went in for the kiss. He whispered in her ear, as his hands explored her body. "You never cease to amaze me, Sy. I can't get over how fucking gorgeous you are. You know, dressed like this, you're really testing my self-control." 

 "You might give it a little free rein. Not too much, and it all ends once we go indoors, understand?" 

 "Perfectly. And if I forget later, or if my brain goes haywire and I lose my mind: Thank you, for sharing the best day of my life." 

 She stopped him from kissing her again. She looked into his eyes, pulled his hand up to her lips, and kissed his palm. "Thank you, Cam, for giving me a dream worth pursuing, three years of play disguised as work, your guidance, your patience, your time. Thank you for sharing this with me. I never dreamed life could be like this. I owe it all to you." 

 "You owe me nothing," he said fiercely. "You're the best partner a man could ask for. You are the yin to my yang, and anyone who sees us together knows it. I couldn't do any of this without you. Even the idea would have been still- born. Without you, there is no Iris. And that would be a shame for the world." 

 His arms surrounded her, holding her gently, like a porcelain doll. His lips caressed hers, soft, warm, sweet. His hands didn't wander, didn't tease her. He held her quietly, letting his kisses tell the story. She tilted her head back exposing her long slender neck to him. She didn't think she'd ever felt so, so...adored? Loved? 

 When his mouth's tender journey ended on hers, she opened her lips, accepting the kiss, taking it, yielding to him. When he pulled away, she was afraid. It was too intense. Too much too soon. If her pressed her, she knew she wouldn't resist. She was up against the railing, the top rail creasing her lower back, her torso bent beyond it. Cam was hovering over her, and she felt his hardness pressing against her lower belly. A steel rod she pushed back against. 

 He eased back, his eyes smoldering, taking in her face. 

 "Pop the bubbly?" she whispered. Anything to break the moment, before she lost all her willpower. 

 He guided her upright, then turned to open the champagne. "What's in the envelope?" he asked. 

 She opened it, and almost laughed out loud. "A free pass for Pure Indulgence." 

 Cam chuckled. "I'm not so sure I like anyone offering my new bride pure indulgence, if it's not me." 

 "It's a foot back and body cleaning, followed by a Balinese Massage, and ending with a facial or foot massage. It's over two hours long, and I'm scheduled for 10:00 am tomorrow." 

 They both looked at each other, recognizing the coincidence. Janine's spa appointment was for 10:00. 

 "I can't think of a better way for you to spend your morning. It will give me a chance to check on business email, and maybe get a start on that little project we discussed. I can join you for lunch around 12:30," Cam said. 

 Sierra grabbed her flute of champagne, and one of the chocolates. She nibbled on it while sipping her bubbly. She stood and walked to the railing, letting the breeze whip her hair around. Looking out over the water, she took a deep breath, and leaned back against Cam, when she felt him stand behind her. 

 "It would be easy to get used to this," she said, when she felt his lips against her neck. She tilted her head to the side, giving him easier access. With a glance to the side, she saw the Devereaux were standing at the railing, apparently more intent on them then their surroundings. 

 She reached back for the rod pressed against her bottom, and grabbed Cam's shaft, making him moan. "Follow," she whispered, and she moved over a few feet, facing the side railing, and the Devereaux. She unabashedly stared across the water, watching Alan Devereaux, fondling his wife. 

 Sierra lifted her glass high, toward the other couple. "Thank you," she called out. 

 * * * 

 "Anonymous, my ass," Alan growled. 

 Janine giggled, lifted her own glass. "You're welcome!" 

 "Geez, Janine!" 

 She laughed, the joyous sound carrying. "Can you make it tomorrow?" she called across the way. 

 "Wouldn't miss it!" came the answer moments later. 

 She leaned back against her husband, just tipsy enough to feel naughty. "Do you think I'm overdressed?" she said softly. 

 Alan needed no more encouragement. He unzipped her sundress, letting the expensive frock settle around her ankles. His wife stood at the railing, naked to the waist, teasing little bikini panties her only apparel. He pressed up behind her, burying his shaft between her ample cheeks. "God, I want you right now," he told her. 

 "Watch," she whispered. 

 * * * 

 Cam saw the display, and ran his hands over Sierra's body. He wondered how far they should take the play, how much she'd allow him. His hands moved to the bottom of her outfit, lifting, and sliding underneath to feel her bare skin. 

 "Take it off me," she told him, her voice low and husky. 

 He grabbed the sides and lifted. Sierra raised her arms, and he pulled it over her head. He tossed it back toward the room, then wrapped his arms around her, his hands seeking out her tits. 

 "Panties too. Take them off and give them to me." 

 His mouth moved to her ear, nibbling her lobe. "You sure?" 

 She nodded. 

 He backed away, dropping to one knee behind her. He eased her panties down, tracing their path with a bevy of kisses, nibbling on her tight little ass. When he reached the back of her knees, she raised one foot, then the other, allowing him to remove her underwear. She held her hand out, and he placed the scrap of material in it. 

 Sierra waved the panties in the air, then laid them on the railing beside her. 

 * * * 

 "Me too," Janine said. 

 "You want me to take your panties off?" Alan asked. He was surprised. This was not like her. Not like her at all. She had never betrayed even a hint of exhibitionism. Just the opposite. She was normally against any form of public display. The kiss as lunch had been almost as shocking as this latest request. 

 "Only if it's Ok with you," she said. 

 He thought about it for a moment. What harm could it be? It's not like they were going to do anything with the other couple. They were separated by 50 feet of water. 

 Alan stepped back and slid his hands down his lovely wife's sides. Still a perfect figure, at 44 years old. Didn't look a day over 30. She paid enough to make sure things stayed that way. And he didn't begrudge her a dime. His hands settled over her hips, and his thumbs slid inside the edge of the waistband. 

 "Slowly." 

 He obeyed, easing her panties down, taking time to bathe her butt-cheeks in a shower of kisses. Little nibbles followed, while the panties were lowered. "Spread your legs," he said. 

 She opened them a little more than shoulder wide, the panties stretched between her knees. "What are you doing?" she asked. 

 "Taking you in," he said, stepping back, basking in the view before him. All but naked, her panties halfway down her legs, he didn't know if he'd ever seen anything sexier. "You look amazing." 

 "When you're done, hand them to me." 

 He took his time, his hands caressing her legs, brushing up the insides of her thighs. She slowly brought her feet closer together, and her panties cascaded down her legs. She lifted one foot free, and lifted the other one, the pale yellow cloth hanging from her ankle. Alan took them, off, and pressed them to his face, breathing deeply, before giving them to her. 

 Janine waved her last article of clothing in the air, and hung them over the railing. "Now your shorts," she said. 

 Alan didn't hesitate. He wanted to free his throbbing erection. He needed to feel the warm air against his skin, before pressing against her once again. He passed his wife his shorts, and peeled off his shirt, tossing it to the side, standing naked on the open deck. 

 Janine waved the shorts in the air, and placed them over the railing on her opposite side. "Hold me, Alan." 

 He didn't need a second invitation. He was pressed against her, holding her in his arms, staring across the water at the naked woman facing their way. 

 * * * 

 Sierra smiled. "Refill?" she asked, holding up her glass. 

 Cam took it and poured it two thirds full. He also retrieved another chocolate. He reached around Sierra with both hands, and she accepted his offering, sipping her champagne, watching Alan Devereaux's hands fondle his gorgeous wife. 

 "Don't you wish I looked like that?" she asked Cam softly. 

 "No, Sierra. I don't. I love you just the way you are. I wouldn't change a thing." 

 "How about a B cup? Maybe even a C?" 

 "Nothing." 

 She knew he was lying. Men liked the titties. She knew that much. "Gimme your shorts." 

 Cam stepped out of them, once more wondering how far she would take this. Was it the booze? The setting? The euphoria of Iris passing all her test with flying colors? Maybe it was how well their plan was working. He wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. He removed his shorts, standing behind her fully naked. He leaned against her, stifling a groan as his hard cock pressed against her soft skin. 

 Sierra waved Cam's shorts in the air, laying them over the railing. She giggled feeling Cam's hardon poking her. "If I didn't know better, I might think you really liked me," she teased, wiggling her butt. 

 * * * 

 Janine felt more alive than she had in years. Sexier, wilder, naughtier. The sight of the panties and shorts hanging over the railing had her trembling. Could she do it? Could she make love in front of another couple? Would Alan be willing to? 

 "More bubbly, dear?" she asked, waving her champagne flute. 

 Alan moaned in frustration, refilling her glass. When he turned to face her, she was leaning over, her breasts resting on the railing. Her legs were open in invitation, her weight shifting from side to side, beckoning. He could see the shimmer of moistness on her inner thigh. 

 "See anything you like, handsome? Yours for the taking. Always." 

 Alan placed her glass on the railing, and took his cock in his hand. He rubbed it up and down her crack, before sliding it back and forth between her legs. 

 "Don't tease me, baby," she moaned. "I'm on fire. I need it. Need it hard." 

 The words were maddening. He bent at the knees, pressing the head into her dripping opening. He couldn't remember ever seeing her like this. With a thrust of his hips he was inside her, and she groaned loudly. 

 Alan stood behind her, hands on her shoulders. He kicked her feet together, opened his legs around hers and eased his cock in and out of her tight pussy. Damn, it was wild, fucking in the outdoors, naked, gazing across the water at the newlyweds. His Janine was on fire, trembling with need. 

 "Hard, Alan! Fuck me! Fuck me hard!" Janine growled. 

 Alan laughed, slapping her ass, watching the alabaster cheek shiver. "I'll fuck you however I want." 

 The words, so matter of fact, so adamant, drove Janine to her first orgasm, moaning loudly, while her husband pounded long easy strokes into her molten tunnel. She raised her head, opened her eyes, and gazed across the water.  

 

 ****** F3 Anything for Iris ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© "Match this," she whispered to herself. 

 * * * 

 Sierra watched in amazement, as the older couple started fucking, buck naked, as if they didn't have a care in the world. She heard Janine's pleas to be fucked hard, and her husband's laugh. The slap to her ass echoed across the water, just as her orgasmic moan echoed in Sierra's loins. 

 She turned to Cam, wrapping her arms around his neck, kissing him. "We can't let them win. We gotta put on a show." 

 Cam was shaking in anticipation. "You... you want to..." 

 "A show," she hissed. "Make it look real, but don't you stick that thing inside me," she breathed into his ear, biting his earlobe for effect. 

 "Can I rub it against you?" 

 She was disturbed with how he was acting. Unsure. That wasn't her Cam. If he was half a man, he'd bend her over the rail, laughing at her, spank her ass, ram his big thick cock up inside her, and fuck her brains out. 

 "Do what you want," she said. "Just keep your dick out of my pussy." 

 Cam heard the change in her voice. From excitement to what? Disappointment? Disrespect? He was doing what she wanted. They had an agreement. Everything he did seemed to push the boundaries. Certainly he wasn't going to shatter them? How would he keep her trust, her respect if he did? They still had at least four more days to go. 

 She had turned back to the railing, bent over, wiggling that firm little butt. She opened her legs, flashing the forbidden. "Now, damn it!" she growled. 

 Whatever he wanted? As long as he didn't fuck her. He turned away and grabbed one of the towels. He folded it carefully, while she kept waving that sweet ass, like a matador waving a red cape. He put his hand on her shoulder, and pulled her upright suddenly, and laid the towel over the railing. 

 She squealed as he lifted her slender body, bending her over the top of the rail, her ass sticking straight up in the air. Her hands waved wildly, before grabbing the railing to stop herself from pitching over the side. "Cam!" she cried out. Her legs stopped, trapped under his arms as he leaned forward and buried his face between her legs. "CAM!" 

 He lifted his face, and bit her ass. "'Do what I want,' you said, Sy. This is what I want." 

 She gasped as his face dove back between her legs, his mouth and tongue devilish instruments. There was no build up, no teasing. He was sucking and tonguing her pussy like there was not tomorrow. Then again, there was a good chance that was true for the sneaky bastard. 

 Sierra lifted her head, looking across the water, shame flushing her skin bright red. Janine's body was rocking with Alan's firms thrusts, and both their eyes were locked on her predicament. "Fuck, the man can eat pussy," she thought. Her breath was coming faster, the shock of his manhandling her dissipating. Her helpless position, her naked body bent over the railing, his relentless mouth working away at her, it was all building a fire inside her she didn't know how she could possibly quench. 

 He pulled her back a little, centering her body weight, so she didn't feel in danger of toppling over the side at any moment. The firm grasp of her legs relinquished, and she felt his hands moving, grabbing her ass, spreading her cheeks. She gasped when his mouth moved up her crack, and moaned loudly when his evil tongue probed her back door. "God," she groaned. 

 Cam was probing her pussy, two fingers pounding at her, merciless, while his tongue crept into her. "How fucking long was that tongue?" she thought, as her virgin butthole was opened, the stubble on his face rasping against the tender skin, his tongue poking in and out of her. 

 She wanted to come, but couldn't. The position was too uncomfortable, she could barely catch her breath as her entire weight was on her lower belly. "Turn me over," she pleaded. "Over, turn me over." 

 She shrieked as he lifted her easily into the air, turning her sideways, and laying her across the towel, along the railing. "Hang on," he muttered, then spread her legs and went back to work. Sierra reached downward, grasping the railings with each hand, shifting, centering her balance, before lowering her legs over his shoulders. "If I fall, I'm gonna kill you," she muttered, then closed her eyes, and let herself go. 

 * * * 

 "He's crazy," Janine moaned, the wild show in front of her sending her heart racing. 

 "Wild," Alan grunted. 

 "Would you do something like that?" she asked. 

 He laughed, swatting her butt cheeks, one at a time. "The question should be: Is there anything I wouldn't do with you?" 

 "Is there?" 

 "I'll let you know if I find one. For now, the answer would be no. You drive me crazy," he gasped, grabbing her hips, and pounding her hard. 

 "Fuuuck," she groaned. "Like that. Don't stop. I'm gonna come you bastard. Don't you stop!" 

 * * * 

 The words from across the water were like an erotic fairy-tale, whispered into her ear. Cam had her at his mercy. His powerful hands, one clutching her outside thigh, the other arm laying across her hips, his finger digging into her ass, had her pinned to the railing. She wasn't going anywhere. 

 His mouth was stuck to her clit, sucking desperately, his teasing tongue, randomly flicking across the sensitive nub. She heard the piercing grunts, the gasps of pleasure, the words of pleasure escaping Janine's lips. Each was like another sensual touch, exciting her. She turned her head, and watching the gorgeous woman getting hammered, her tits flattening against the railing with each powerful stroke. 

 Her vision tunneled, blocking out all but the erotic scene. Her hands gave up their death grip on the railing, reaching up and grabbing her own tits, squeezing her nipples. So close, so damn close. 

 She gasped as his hand let go of her leg, only the arm across her body holding her in place. His fingers entered her again, forceful, unrelenting, alternating between working the top of her pussy, with reach down and deep. Each thrust was driving her crazier. 

 His mouth movement changed, and it was as if someone had stuck a live vibrator right on her clit. His tongue moving faster than it had any right to. God, like that, just like that, don't stop, don't, don't... 

 Her shriek rent the night air, echoing off the buildings, setting far away voices laughing. A louder echo returned from the far deck, until it took on a personal sound of its own. Janine's orgasm was only seconds after her own. 

 Sierra's entire body was shaking, and Cam had to hold on tight, to make sure he didn't lose her. He slowed down, sucking away at her delicious little pussy, wondering what the price was he'd have to pay for taking advantage of her. 

 Once she'd almost returned to normal, he stood. He lifted and turned her, so her upper back was resting on the railing. He held her by the ass, her legs flopping over his arms, and lowered her pussy, until he cock was pressing against it. He lifted her just enough that he could rub his shaft along her slippery opening, stroking the full length across her clit. 

 She gasped, wondering when he'd stop teasing her, and shove that cock in where it belonged. The sensation was maddening, each stroke sending shocks of pleasure through her body. 

 His hands held her firmly, raising and lowering her, as he grunted, sliding his shaft against her. 

 "Fuck me," she groaned. "Just fuck me." 

 Cam almost did, before realizing it was all part of the show. "Fuck... you... Sy!" he growled, pressing harder, slamming his aching balls against her pussy at the end of each stroke. 

 He didn't give a damn about the Devereaux, or anything else for that matter. He stared downward, where one little movement would have him sliding his entire length inside that steaming little pussy. The sweat was dripping off his forehead, as he pounded away. "Gonna... fuck... this... pussy!" 

 "Fuck me!" Sierra shrieked, desperate to feel him filling her. 

 Her words were almost a demand. He lowered his hips, driving the head of his cock into her opening, before popping free, and scraping across her clit. Over and over he teased her without ever going all the way. She was shaking, breathing hard, the feeling absolutely mind-blowing. She tilted her head back, looking across the water upside-down. She saw they were both standing now, Alan's arms enveloping his woman, as they watched. 

 "Fuck her," echoed across the water, making Sierra gasp. 

 "Gonna... come," Cam groaned loudly. 

 "Fill me. Fill me up. Do it!" Sierra pleaded. 

 She felt the first searing splash on her belly, as his shaft rubbed her poor abused clit ram. On the next stroke, she felt his cum spurting across the mouth of her pussy, pooling around her clit, his movement lubricated by his own cum. She lost it, crying out as he shot several more bursts against her skin. 

 Then he was lowering her to the ground, onto shaky legs, holding her steady, clutching her to his chest. She hung on for dear life, until he lifted her into his arms. "Wave to our friends, Sierra dear." 

 She lifted an arm weakly, waving. 

 "Good night," Cam called across the way. 

 "'Night, love birds," he heard the clear reply. 

 He took her into the room, and laid her on the bed. He disappeared into the bathroom for a few moments, cleaning himself, and then wiping her down with a warm washcloth. She lay limp, exhausted, mentally and physically. 

 Cam pulled back the sheets, and eased her between them. He closed up shop, bringing in their clothing, covering up the chocolate, and shutting doors. He turned out the lights, and slid into the bed. He sidled up to Sierra, cuddling in close. 

 "You Ok?" he asked quietly. 

 "You took advantage of me," she whispered. There was no harshness in her voice, and she turned toward him, snuggling into his strong arms. 

 "Sorry. I think we gave them a hell of show, don't you?" 

 She chuckled, and her lips kissed his chest, his shoulder. "More than I expected." 

 He brushed her hair back, kissing her forehead. His hand slid down her smooth side coming to rest on her ass. "You're not too mad, are you?" 

 She shook her head, shifting her legs, sliding one between his. "Thanks for not doing more. I think." 

 His body shook as he laughed lightly. "You'll never know how hard it was to stop." 

 She was quiet, her breathing even, as he rolled onto his back, drawing her with him, until she was half on his body. His hands weren't idle, caressing her skin. 

 He was half asleep when he heard her whisper, "If you behave yourself, maybe you can do that again." 

 Her hand slid down and came to rest on his cock, giving it a little squeeze. 

 Fuck. He was never going to get to sleep. 

 And this was just day one. If nothing else came of this trip, he was already willing to call it a complete success. Iris tested out perfect, everything they'd dreamed, and he was in bed with the smartest, sexiest woman he knew. Funny how life had a way of working things out. Report_Story
