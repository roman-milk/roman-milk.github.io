Rob and Ellen Ch. 01
====================

I was sitting in my favorite restaurant, one where I ate breakfast four or five times a week, and working on the New York Times crossword puzzle when the waitress slid onto the seat across from me. 

 "Well Rob, are you ready yet?" Dixie asked. 

 I knew what she was asking so I gave her a shrug and said, "Not yet Dixie. Not quite yet." 

 "It has been six months Rob. You need to get over it and I'm the girl who wants to help you do it." 

 "I thank you for that Dixie, but I don't know if I'll ever be ready." 

 "Come on Rob. You can't go the rest of your life without. For one thing it isn't natural and secondly it isn't healthy. I give great head Rob and I promise you that I can fuck your brains out. I can make you forget her Rob. All you have to do is give me a chance." 

 "You forget Dixie; I've already been there and I know what I'm passing up, but I'm just not up to it." 

 "When you are Rob just remember I'm here. I will tell you this. If I ever get my hooks in you again I promise that I'll never let go." 

 She got up and went back to waiting on customers and as I watched her walk away I wondered where we might have been if I had refused to take "no" for an answer. 

 ----------------------------------------------- 

 I met Dixie on the day I had returned home from spending three years in the Army. It was a Wednesday when the bus let me off on the corner of Evans and Silver Hope and as it pulled away I saw Angie's Café across the street. It had been a long bus ride and I was tired and hungry. My plan was to walk over to where my dad worked and ride home with him, but it would be two hours before he got off so I walked across the street to Angie's. 

 Angie was at the register when I walked in and when she saw me she came out from behind the counter, took me in a big hug, gave me a kiss and said: 

 "Welcome home Rob. Your dad said that you would be coming home soon." 

 I'd known Angie forever. I had dated both of her daughters and I'd spent my seventeenth summer working for her as a dishwasher. She walked me to a booth, sat down with me and asked me what my plans were. 

 "Get a job and get on with my life." 

 She laughed and said, "That life won't include Linda or Lori. They are both married now and Linda is expecting." 

 "My loss. Too bad I felt the need to go and put some excitement in my life." 

 "Did you?" 

 "Did I what?" 

 "Find the excitement that you were looking for?" 

 "Not much excitement in being a clerk in supply. I did get to see Japan, Korea and Hawaii which I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed home." 

 A customer walked up to the register so Angie got up to go and take his money and as she slid out of the booth a totally hot redhead walked up and Angie said: 

 "Take good care of him Dixie." 

 The redhead smiled at me and said, "I wonder just how good she wants me to take care of you." 

 One thing I have never been is shy and so I said, "Since she is your boss I think you should keep her happy and that means you should treat me in such a way that I tell Angie good things about you." 

 "What do you think it would take for you to make a good report?" 

 "We need to sit down and discuss that. What time do you get off and what are your days off?" 

 "Five and Thursday Friday." 

 "Tell me where to pick you up tomorrow and at what time." 

 "What if I say "Whoa up there hoss; you are moving a little too fast." 

 "I give Angie a really, really bad report." 

 "Oh God, we would not want that" and that is the way my relationship with Dixie started. 

 We were sharing beds after the third date and we went at it hot and heavy for the next six months and then I asked her to marry me. She said no. She thanked me for asking and then told me that while she had some strong feelings for me she just wasn't ready to settle down. 

 "I'm young Rob and I want to have some fun while I can." 

 Instead of trying to talk her into changing her mind I got pissed and decided "Who needs her anyway" and I started looking for other opportunities. I started dating and I avoided Angie's except on Dixie's days off. After about three months I did stop in at Angie's on a Saturday and Dixie was the waitress for the section I sat down in. 

 "Where have you been Rob? I haven't heard from you in a while." 

 "Didn't want to interfere with your having fun." 

 "Why would you say something like that?" 

 "Isn't that what you told me? You wouldn't marry me because you wanted to have fun? To me that meant that you weren't having fun with me so I got out of your way. I'll have the short stack with a side of bacon." 

 She wrote the order down and walked off in a huff and when she brought me my order she set it down in front of me and walked off without a word. From then on I made sure that I didn't sit in Dixie's section when I stopped at Angie's. 

 ------------------------------------- 

 It was a little over a year after Dixie and I split that I met Ellen. A week after I'd gotten home from the Army I'd gotten a job in the warehouse at Wayman Industries. They hired me because they wanted someone with strong inventory management skills and that was pretty much what I did in the Army. Inside of six months I had everything computerized and inventory controls in place. The bean counters said that the system that I had put into place was saving the company between 16 and 20k a year just in materials. Who was I to argue with them? 

 When the manager of my department retired I was offered his job and I took it. As a manager I had to attend meeting and it was at one of those meetings that I met Ellen. Ellen worked in purchasing and we had talked a time or two on the phone when she had called for information on order points or some such, but we had never met face to face. 

 We ended up sitting next to each other at the meeting and we got to talking at the break. It turned out that we both had a lot in common. We both liked bowling, NASCAR racing and country-western dancing, but the thing we really had in common were the places we had been. She was an Army brat and she had been to Japan, Korea and Hawaii with her dad and mom. We got to comparing what cities we had been to and what places we had visited and we were still at it when the meeting resumed. I asked her if she would like to continue over dinner and to my great delight she said yes. 

 After the meeting we went to Sabatini's for dinner and I enjoyed her company enough that I asked her for a date. She said yes and Saturday night I took her to The Rose where we could dance to the music of Jimmy Little and The Barnyard Stompers. After we found a table and had ordered drinks I pulled her over to where a line dance was setting up. 

 "I thought real cowboys didn't line dance" she said as I moved us into position. 

 "I'm not a cowboy little lady; just a poor boy who works in a warehouse." 

 "Yeah, right" she said as the music started. 

 Ellen taught me the Electric Slide and I taught her the finer points of the 'Tush Push' but what Ellen was really into was western swing and that girl could go all night. I was worn to a frazzle when last call came, but she seemed fresh as a daisy and acted like she could go all night. 

 When I got her home and walked her to her door she went up on her toes and kissed my cheek, told me she'd had fun and then she said: 

 "We just have to do this again." 

 We did do it again – a half dozen times – and each time I felt like we had something good going. For the first time in my life I was afraid of doing the wrong thing and scaring the girl off so I did nothing except keep asking for dates. Then came the night when I took Ellen home after a night of dancing and she asked: 

 "Is there something wrong with me?" 

 "Of course not. Why would you ask a question like that?" 

 "We have been dating almost two months and you have never tried anything with me." 

 I was caught flat-footed and didn't know what to say and Ellen read the look on my face and said: 

 "Out with it Rob. What is going on here?" 

 I took a deep breath and told her how I felt. She looked at me and then shook her head as she said: 

 "Silly, silly man. So much time wasted" and then she took me by the hand and led me into her apartment. She led me to the couch and pushed me down on it and then she crawled onto my lap as she said: 

 "No goodnight kiss tonight Rob. Tonight it is goodnight kisses" and she took my head in her hands and pulled my mouth to hers. We made out like teenagers at a drive in for a long time before she got up and told me to stay put. She left the room only to return four or five minutes later as naked as the day she was born. She struck a pose and said: 

 "Does this give you any ideas sailor?" 

 Six months later we were married. 

 ---------------------------- 

 We spent our honeymoon in Hawaii visiting all the places we had seen when we each had been there. We made love on the beach at night and outside on the balcony of our hotel room. I found that my new wife had a touch of the exhibitionist in her when we were away from home. She gave me head in the cab on the way to the airport – in broad daylight – after tossing the driver her panties and telling him to cover the rear view mirror with them. When I paid the fare I tipped him twenty bucks and Ellen told him he could keep the panties as another tip. Waiting to board the flight home I asked Ellen what had gotten in to her. 

 "I just felt the need to be wicked and a bit slutty." 

 "Slutty?" 

 "You should have asked the driver if he could feel how wet my panties were when I handed them to him." 

 "Is this something that I need to look out for or look forward to?" 

 "Never know when the mood might strike me lover. You had best be ready for anything." 

 She did indeed hit me with a surprise every once in a while like the time at my father's birthday party when she pulled me out into my parent's garage and had me make love to her on the hood of my dad's Corvette. Then there was the time at our company Christmas party when she had me do her in the hotel's coatroom on the boss's wife's mink coat. 

 We had a great life together. We played golf on the weekends, went dancing at least one night a week, bowled in a mixed league and made love three and four times a week. The only fly in the ointment, at least as far as I was concerned, was that Ellen's job in purchasing as a buyer required that she travel some. Usually no more than four or five days a month, but that meant nights that I had to sleep alone and I did not much like not having Ellen's body close to mine when I woke up in the morning. 

 When Ellen and I married we made the decision that even though we both wanted children we would hold off until our fifth anniversary before trying to start a family. We wanted to be able to enjoy ourselves, go places and see and do things before tying ourselves down with children. Also, we wanted to be financially stable and in our own home before we started listening to the pitter-patter of little feet. Ellen did not like the feel of condoms so she took birth control pills and backed them up with a diaphragm and spermicides and they must have been effective because we did make it to our fifth anniversary without any surprises. 

 We went out dancing three weeks before our anniversary and on the way home Ellen asked" 

 "Are you ready to be a daddy yet?" 

 "The question is are you ready to be a mommy?" 

 "Yes I am." 

 "Then I guess fatherhood is in the cards for me." 

 "Good" she said as she slid over next to me, unzipped my pants and worked out my cock. "Enjoy this one lover because you won't get any more after I go off the pill. Once I'm off the pill all of your baby makers will go into the baby factory instead of my mouth. At least until after I'm pregnant." 

 The next day she was off the pill and we were working at getting her 'with child' as they say. Four days before our anniversary she left on a three day trip to Denver that was supposed to have her home in time to celebrate our anniversary but a snow storm closed the Denver airport for two days. The day she was due home a major problem occurred at our St. Louis plant and I got tagged to go as part of the team that was being sent to clean up the mess. We probably passed each other at the airport and it was three days before I got home. 

 It was the longest that we had been apart since getting married and I'm not sure how the bed managed to survive our reunion or the days that followed. 

 A good job, a great wife, a lovely home and the prospect of a family on the way. Life was good. 

 And then my perfect little world fell apart. 

 -------------------------------------- 

 I came home from work one Thursday night and found Ellen sitting at the kitchen table with an opened bottle of wine and two glasses already poured. Ellen was sipping hers and she waited until I sat down and took a sip of mine before she said: 

 "I'm pregnant." 

 "Honey that's great." 

 "No it isn't Rob. I'm sorry Rob, but it isn't yours." 

 I sat there with the wine glass halfway to my lips too stunned to say a word. Not mine? How could that be? And then it hit me. 

 "Whose is it?" 

 "Some guy named Stu." 

 "Some guy named Stu? That's all you can tell me? Some guy named Stu?" 

 "That's all I know about him. I never knew his last name." 

 "How long has it been going on Ellen? How long have you been stabbing me in the back?" 

 "It was only the one time Rob." 

 I stood up and threw the wine glass against the kitchen wall and turned to walk away. As I got to the front door Ellen asked: 

 "Where are you going Rob?" 

 "Away from you Ellen; away from you." 

 I ended up at Casey's Bar and sat there and did a number on myself. I woke up in the morning on the couch in our living room with a head that felt like it had a marching band stomping around inside of it. As I struggled to sit up Ellen appeared and handed me several Extra Strength Tylenol and a glass of water. After I downed the pills I asked: 

 "How did I get here?" 

 "I drove around until I found your car and then I went inside and sat at a table until the place closed. The bartender helped me get you into the car and I brought you home." 

 "Why did you bother?" 

 "Because I love you Rob." 

 "You love me so much that you go out and fuck other guys. Sorry Ellen, but that doesn't even come close to my definition of love." 

 "Maybe not Rob, but I do love you and I'm sorry for the pain I'm causing you." 

 "Yeah, sure Ellen." 

 "I called you in sick and I took a comp day. You need to go and soak in a hot tub and then we need to sit down and talk." 

 "Talk? Talk about what? You rip my heart out and you want to talk about it? For God's sake why? You want to drive the nails in deeper?" 

 "We need to talk about where we go from here Rob." 

 "Where we go from here? WE don't go anywhere from here Ellen. Where you go or where I go I have no idea, but WE aren't going anywhere." 

 "Go soak and I'll make you some breakfast." 

 I did go soak in the tub, but I was in no mood to deal with Ellen so after I'd dried myself off and dressed I left the house and went to Angie's for breakfast. The only booth open was in Dixie's section and when she brought me the menu and a cup of coffee she asked: 

 "How's it going Rob?" 

 "Not worth a fuck Dixie; not worth a flying fuck." 

 "That sounds bad honey. Anything Dixie can do to make it better?" 

 "The time for that is long past Dixie. You could have prevented it if only you would have said yes when I asked you to marry me, but you didn't so I am where I am." 

 "I thought all was sunshine and roses with you and Ellen." 

 "Hardly Dixie' more like hurricanes and hail stones." 

 "I get off at five if you would like to talk about it." 

 "Thanks for the offer Dixie, but I'm in too foul a mood right now to talk to anybody." 

 "Keep me in mind when you are ready honey. Every now and then I think back to when you asked me and think that saying no was the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life." 

 After I finished eating I got in my car and drove around more or less aimlessly for a couple of hours and then I drove home. 

 Ellen was sitting on the couch reading a book when I walked in. She marked her place, set the book down and asked: 

 "Ready to talk yet?" 

 "There is nothing to talk about. You cheated on me with another man, got yourself knocked up and all the talking in the world is not going to change that. All that is left is to involve the lawyers and the courts." 

 "I don't want a divorce Rob." 

 "I didn't want a wife pregnant with another man's baby, but I got one." 

 "It isn't the end of the world Rob. I love you and you should know it by now. I love you and I want to be with you." 

 "But only when you aren't on trips, right? When you are off on your company sponsored mini-vacations you are spreading for some one else. How long has it been going on Ellen? How many have there been?" 

 "It was only the one time Rob." 

 "Yeah! Like I'm going to believe that." 

 "Why not? It is true." 

 "I only have your word for that Ellen and right now your word isn't worth shit." 

 "You can believe me Rob. I have no reason to lie to you. What I did should prove that to you." 

 "What you did? Getting knocked up proves that you have no reason to lie to me?" 

 "Not that Rob, just the fact that I told you that I'm pregnant and that it isn't yours. Both you and Stu have brown eyes and brown hair. I could have kept my mouth shut and nine months from now you would be holding a baby and beaming like all new fathers never knowing that it wasn't yours. I could not do that to you Rob. I love you too much to let you raise another man's child thinking that it was yours. If I can be that honest with you you can believe me when I say Stu was the only one ever." 

 "That is still one more than should have happened and the fact that it did happen makes you a cheating slut in my eyes." 

 "I know that Rob and I'm sorry. I didn't go on that trip meaning for it to happen or expecting it to happen." 

 "It just happened, is that it? You had too much to drink, weren't really yourself and it just happened?" 

 "No Rob; no lies here. I did what I did because I wanted to do it. When I went to Stu's bed that night it was because I wanted to go there. I was drinking, but I'm not blaming alcohol for what I did." 

 "You were so dissatisfied with me that you deliberately picked up some guy and fucked him?" 

 "Of course not Rob. I have never been dissatisfied with you. I can't give you a rational explanation." 

 "No rational explanation? Did he drug you? Use one of those date rape drugs on you?" 

 "No Rob, none of that. There were two conventions and a seminar going on at the hotel where I was staying. The people I was there seeing took me to dinner and we ended up in the hotel lounge. The place was packed because of the conventions and seminar and there were no empty tables. Elise saw someone she knew sitting at a table and there were three empty seats which would work for Elise, Bev and me so Elise walked over and asked if we could join him. There were two guys sitting there, Ralph, who was the guy she knew and Stu. We ordered drinks and talked for a bit. The guys asked us to dance and it did seem only fair since they did let us join them. I danced several dances with both men and then Elise had to go. Half an hour later Bev and Ralph, who had apparently connected, got up and left. 

 "I was enjoying myself and was in no hurry to go up to my room so I stayed at the table with Stu. We danced some more and now that we were alone he started putting some moves on me. At first I didn't care because I knew he wasn't going to get anywhere, but as the evening wore on I started thinking "why not?" It would be exciting and no one would be hurt by it. Just a little illicit sex with a guy I'd never see again. Just the thought of cheating had my panties wet. Finally I just looked him in the eye and asked him if he was going to keep on playing games or was he going to ask me up to his room. Ten minutes later I was naked on his bed. I won't lie to you Rob. The sex was awesome. I had three strong orgasms before we finished and as I walked back to my room I had a big smile on my face.  

 

 

===

"Don't get me wrong here Rob. He was not a better lover than you – he wasn't even close to being as good as you are – it was the cheating, the nastiness of the illicit sex that drove my orgasms. I got back to my hotel room and looked at myself in the mirror and I didn't see any sign that I'd just been a slut for a man not my husband, but as I looked at myself the enormity of what I'd just done hit me. I had just deliberately cheated on the man I loved. My stomach lurched and I had to rush to the bathroom. I spent the rest of the night between lying on the bed and crying and rushing to the toilet and retching. 

 "It wasn't until I was on the plane home that it hit me. I'd gone of birth control and put away my diaphragm because we were going to start our family and I'd just had unprotected sex with a stranger. I spent the rest of the flight running between my seat and the toilet. The one thing I had not expected was the guilt that hit me when it was all over with. Guilt had me rushing to the bathroom two and three times a day. I knew that what I'd done would never happen again because of the guilt I was feeling. It was crushing. Between all of the throwing up and crying I did I'm surprised that you didn't notice and press me to find out what was wrong. 

 "I swear to God Rob that it will never happen again and I regret that it even happened once. I love you Rob and I want to be with you. I want to live my life with you. I'm asking you to forgive me. I'm begging you to forgive me." 

 I looked at her in silence for almost a minute and then I pointed at her mid- section and asked: 

 "And what about that?" 

 She knew immediately what I was asking and she looked away. She couldn't meet my eyes as she said: 

 "I'm going to have the baby Rob. It is a life. It isn't the baby's fault. It did nothing wrong. It did not ask to be there." 

 "And then what? Put it up for adoption?" 

 "No Rob, I couldn't do that. I'm the child's mother. I'll be giving the child life. Ten years down the road I don't want to find myself wondering where my baby is and if it is being taken care of properly and loved. No Rob, I'm keeping the baby." 

 "At the expense of your husband?" 

 "It doesn't have to be that way Rob. You have a big heart and you can find room in it for this baby." 

 "You don't know me at all do you? No way I could look at that child every day and not have it driven home just how the child came to be there. That's the killer Ellen. The constant reminder of what you did. How can you expect me to forgive you when for the next nine months every time I see your growing body I will be reminded of what you did? How can I forgive you when every time the baby cries it will bring back the memory of how it came to be in existence? The child will be a constant reminder of your unfaithful actions. I don't think forgiveness is in the cards Ellen. It would be hard enough without the constant reminder, but it will be impossible with it. 

 "I have no idea what I am going to do. The one thing that I do know is that I can't afford two separate residences so me moving out is not an option at this time. I'll know more about what I'm going to do after talking to an attorney, but until then you have forfeited any right to share my bed. You will move all of your stuff out of the bedroom and you can use one of the spare bedrooms." 

 "Please Rob, I...." 

 "No more Ellen. No more talk until after I've seen an attorney." 

 I got up and went out to the garage to find something that would keep me busy and away from Ellen. 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

I watched him walk out to the garage and was glad that he would never know the truth of my night with Stu. The truth would just kill him. The truth was that Stu had given me the best sex of my life. It had been so good that I wasn't sure that I wouldn't have run away with him if he had asked. I really do love Rob and I'm sorry now that Stu and I played. I told the truth about the guilt I was carrying, but deep in my heart I know that I had kind of lied when I said 'never again.' It would never happen again unless I ran into Stu again and if that happened all bets were off. 

 I remembered that night and felt my pussy dampen with the memory. It had happened the way I'd told Rob, but I'd left out a whole lot of detail. Like the part where Stu told me that he wanted to make love to me and I'd said. "Sorry, but I'm married." He had smiled and said: 

 "I know. That's why I want you. Cheating sex is always the best kind. When you are cheating there is always a little extra zing to it." 

 The more we danced the more I thought about what Stu had said and I finally decided that I wanted to see about the "extra zing." It would be a one time thing and Rob would never know. Once I decided I hit Stu with the 'game playing' comment and he took me by the hand and led me to the elevator. As soon as the door closed he kissed me while one hand worked its way up under my skirt and before we had gone up one floor he had a finger in my pussy. The other hand had my left breast out of my dress and bra and I felt so slutty leaning back against the elevator wall high heeled feet spread wide as Stu kissed me and finger fucked me. 

 When the door opened on the fifteenth floor Stu's pants were unzipped and I had his cock in my hands, both of my tits were out of my dress and he had three fingers in me. Without giving me a chance to tuck my breasts back into my dress he took me by the hand and pulled me out of the elevator and into the hallway where an older coupler were walking up to the elevator. I saw the shock on their faces and I almost laughed as Stu pulled me down the hall toward his room. We got to room 1516 and Stu made me bend and take hold of the door knob. He moved my legs apart and unzipped and then he pushed my panties aside and entered my already soaking pussy with one hard push. He fucked me standing there in the hallway where anyone could have come out of their room or gotten off the elevator and seen us. 

 I had the first of my many orgasms of that night in that hotel corridor. Just after I came Stu shot his load into me and as he pulled out he said: 

 "That was the quick one. Needed to get it out of the way. Don't worry my sweet little slut, there is more to come." 

 He opened the door to the room and as soon as we were inside he pushed me to my knees and stuck his cock in my face and told me to get him hard again. I sucked it in greedily and gave him the best head that I could. I felt so slutty being on my knees in a strange man's room and sucking a strange man's cock. Stu had been right. There was a special zing to it. 

 When he was hard again we quickly undressed and got on the bed and he entered me from behind and fucked me like a dog. I came twice before he came again and then he pushed me into position for a sixty-nine and I went after his cock like a dog after a meaty bone. It took me longer to get him up that time, but I got the job done and we spent almost twenty minutes -- with three more orgasms for me -- in the missionary position and then we fell asleep exhausted. 

 I woke up in the morning to find Stu working on my butt with his fingers and some lube. I have never been taken anally before, but then I'd never been a cheating whore before either so I kept quiet and let him continue. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that I thought I would ever want to do again either. We showered together and that led us back to the bed for another session of doggie sex. I dressed, kissed him goodbye and then headed back for my own room. I passed several people in the hallway and I wondered if looked to them like the slut I had spent the night being. 

 It wasn't until I was in my room and looking at myself in the mirror that I realized that in my passion I had totally forgotten that I was unprotected. 

 And now I was having to pay the price for that bit of stupidity. 

 I did love Rob and I knew that he loved (or had loved) me and I hoped that love would be strong enough to keep us together. I knew it would take time and a ton of forgiveness but I had to hope. 

 ---------------------------------- 

 As I puttered in the garage I thought about what Ellen had just told me. She said I could believe her when she said it was only the one time, but could I really? Just because she told me about her night and her pregnancy didn't mean that she wouldn't lie about others. How could I ever believe her after what she had admitted to? She had cheated on me and she would have kept it hidden -- and perhaps done it again -- and only confessed because she was afraid of what the baby would look like when it arrived. Maybe she lied about this Stu character having brown hair and eyes to make her lie more believable. For all I knew he had red hair and blue eyes. Telling me that she could have kept quiet about the baby because the asshole had the same color hair and eyes could have just been window dressing to try and convince me that...oh what the fuck! Why was I even trying to work my way through it. The bottom line was that Ellen had cheated on me and had gotten knocked up by the asshole she cheated with. The only things I should be thinking about were the things I needed to do. 

 First on the list was to see an attorney. I was pretty sure that I already knew the basics. We lived in a no-fault state so it would be an even split of assets. We both made about the same money so there would be no alimony and as far as child support was concerned Ellen would have to take that up with good old Stu. 

 I loved Ellen and I probably could have gotten by her having an affair as long as it was only the one time, but there was no way, love or no, I could live with another man's child. A child who would be a constant reminder of what she had done. 

 When I went back into the house Ellen was still sitting where I'd left her and I ignored her, but as I was passing by her she said: 

 "I need a big favor Rob." I stopped and she said, "If you are going to divorce me could you at least wait until after the baby is born?" 

 "Why the fuck would I want to do that?" 

 "I'm covered under your health insurance. If you divorce me before the baby is born I won't be able to get coverage for the pregnancy because they will call it a pre-existing condition." 

 "Beautiful Ellen; just fucking beautiful. You not only cuckold me but want me to subsidize the little bastard that you are carrying." 

 "You won't be subsidizing anything Rob because I'll pay all the deductibles." 

 "I'll still be paying for the kid even if you do pay the deductible and other expenses. I'll be paying for the family plan when I could save over five hundred a month switching coverage to just myself." 

 "Oh for God's sake Rob! I'll pay you the goddamned difference." 

 I shrugged and went on up to the bedroom slightly pleased that I'd made Ellen lose a bit of her control. I was in bed when I heard Ellen come up the stairs and I heard her stop outside the bedroom door and a minute later she moved on and I heard the door of the spare bedroom down the hall open and then close. 

 -------------------------------- 

 The next morning at work I called several of my friends who had gone through divorces and got recommendations on divorce attorneys and then I called the one most recommended and made an appointment. He was able to see me the next day so I went to my boss and told him I had to take the next day off to take care of some personal business. 

 When I got home that night I found Ellen sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of wine in front of her. I couldn't resist the dig and so I said: 

 "I thought that the conventional wisdom was that you weren't supposed to drink when you are pregnant." 

 She looked up at me and didn't say anything for a couple of seconds and then she said: 

 "You are really going to do it? I didn't think you would. I really didn't think that you would." 

 "Didn't think that I would do what?" 

 "Go for a divorce. Mary Tolliver called me today. She told me that you had called Marv about a divorce lawyer." 

 "Of course I'm going for a divorce Ellen. You are sitting there with another man's child in you. What I can't understand is why you think that I should just accept that and go on like nothing is wrong." 

 "Because I love you Rob and I know that you love me. It is a problem Rob, a big problem, but we can work through it. I know we can." 

 "Maybe if it had happened because you were drunk on your ass and were taken advantage of or were the victim of a date rape drug, but none of that happened did it? By your own admission you knew what you were doing when you went into that man's room. By your own admission you went into that room because you wanted to go there. You say that you love me. When you were on that bed, legs spread and you were being fucked were you thinking, "This means nothing Rob. I love you and this means nothing." Were you saying to yourself "This is exciting, but Rob fucks me better." Did my name enter your mind at all between the time you got on that elevator and you returned to your own room?" 

 She looked down at the table and away from me so we both knew the answer to that one." 

 "I got stupid Rob. I made a mistake -- a big one -- and I regret it. God do I ever regret it. I'm sorry Rob; I'm really, really sorry." 

 "I don't doubt that for a second Ellen. You regret getting caught and you are sorry that I ended up finding out." 

 She didn't respond to that. She got up and got dinner off the stove and set it on the table. We ate in silence and when we were done I helped clear the table and load the dishwasher and then I went and found something to keep me busy. 

 The next day I saw the attorney and had what I already knew confirmed. It didn't matter if the grounds were infidelity or irreconcilable differences it would still be a fifty-fifty split of assets. If I filed for irreconcilable differences and it wasn't contested it could be over in three months. If I went for infidelity it would take three times as long regardless if Ellen fought it or not. It wasn't likely that there would be any alimony, but that would depend a lot on the judge we drew. There were some very liberal judges who always, regardless of circumstances, favored the wife and if we end up with one of them and Ellen cried "Oh what will I do when I can't go to work" I could end up paying some alimony. 

 The big surprise for me was that under current state law I was responsible for the child Ellen was carrying until such time as a DNA test could be done to prove that the child wasn't mine. That meant that I would have to leave Ellen on my health insurance after all. 

 "Quite frankly" the attorney said, "You would be better off holding off on the divorce until after the baby is born and your wife returns to work." 

 -------------------------- 

 Ellen had dinner on the table and she was sitting there with a glass of wine when I walked in. She looked at me and said "Well?" 

 "Well what?" 

 "You saw a lawyer today so what are you going to do?" 

 "I'm stuck with you until the baby is born. According to state law I'm responsible for the baby until a DNA test can be run to prove to the courts that the kid isn't mine. I could move out, but I'd still have to keep you on my insurance until the 'happy event' occurs so I might as well leave things as they are until then. Should be no problem. Separate bedrooms will help me keep it civil. I'll start eating out on the way home from work and that will keep you from having to cook for me." 

 "Don't be silly. I'd still have to cook for me. If you are dead set on having nothing to do with me I'll eat in the family room so you won't have to look at me across the table. Nothing else has to change. Alone or with you I still have to clean house and do laundry and I have always washed our clothes together so no change there. However there is one thing. If you are not going to share a bed with me you will have to make your own bed and keep your own room clean. Now if you will excuse me I need to go and find some place where I can be alone and feel sorry for myself." 

 --------------------------- 

 For the next three months we co-existed in the house. The meals were silent and we didn't speak to each other unless something happened where we had to. And then one Friday I came home from work and found a note on the kitchen table. 

 "Rob -- 

 I can't take it any more. I can't live like this. I love you; I miss your touch, your taste and everything about you. It is killing me to be so close to you and yet so far away. I'm going to stay with my parents. You have their number if you need to reach me. I'm sorry Rob. I'm so very sorry for what I did to us. I love you and I always will. 

 Love, 

 Ellen" 

 The next morning I got a call at work from Ellen's father. "I'm in town today. Any chance you can join me for lunch?" 

 I knew what was going to happen, but I said, "Markham's at noon?" 

 "Good enough. See you there." 

 Jack was already at a table when I got there. We shook hands and got all the "good to see you" stuff out of the way and then the waiter was there to take our order. As soon as the waiter was gone Jack said: 

 "I guess you know what I wanted to see you about." 

 "Afraid so." 

 "Ellen is a mental wreck and her mother and I are worried about her. What happened between you two? Why did you kick Ellen out?" 

 "Hold up there Jack. I did not kick Ellen out. I came home from work and found a note on the kitchen able telling me that she was going to stay with you." 

 "But why? What happened between you two that caused that to happen?" 

 "You will have to get that from Ellen Jack. It is something that she will have to decide to make public. I won't go there." 

 "You have to give me more than that Rob. She is your wife and she is carrying your child. What could possibly be so bad that you would let Ellen and your child go?" 

 "Again Jack all I can say is that you will have to get it from Ellen. She chose to leave. I did not kick her out." 

 Two days later Jack called me. "I didn't realize it was that bad. I can't believe that I raised some one who could be that stupid. She does love you you know. Are you sure that there isn't any way you can work it out?" 

 "I don't see how Jack. She is determined to have the baby and with it around to remind me I can't see any way that I can forgive. From where I sit you can't forgive if you can't at least try and forget and the child would be a constant reminder. 

 "I'm sorry that you feel that way Rob. You have been good for Ellen and a great son in law. I hate to lose you." 

 "Thank you for that Jack. I feel the same about you as a father in law, but what can I say. Shit happens, even to the best of us." 

 Other things happened also. One was totally unexpected. As long as Ellen and I shared the house even though our interaction was limited the house seemed right. Once Ellen was gone it didn't. It took a while, but it finally dawned on me that what was wrong was that Ellen was gone and I missed her. Granted, we weren't getting along, but she was there. I saw her every day and I had not realized it, but her presence had been comforting. 

 I sat on the patio, drank beer, looked up at the stars and pondered the contradiction. Why did I miss her if I didn't want anything to do with her? How could her absence upset me so much when I couldn't stand to look at her when she was there in the house with me? I had to admit to myself that I loved Ellen and I missed her terribly. How could I miss her so much and deliberately stay away from her? About the only thing I figured out was that maybe I shouldn't drink beer and stare up at the stars. 

 --------------------------- 

 The meeting with Elsie at the plant had gone well. My visit had occurred at the just the right time from my standpoint at least. Keifer Industries was suffering some cash flow problems. Elise didn't tell me that of course -- it was rumored in the industry -- and I was able to negotiate some lower prices for the orders I'd placed. 

 Elise asked me if I would like to join her for dinner and having nothing better to do than go back to a lonely hotel room I said yes. We ate at the restaurant in the Hilton and we had finished eating and were sipping an after dinner drink when I saw him walk in. He joined a man at a table and while talking with Elise I kept looking over at him. Elise noticed and she looked over and then said: 

 "Isn't that the guy you did all the dancing with the last time you were here?" 

 "That's him." 

 "Want to go over and let him know you are here?" 

 "No thanks; not a good idea. Last time I almost let him get me up to his room. I'm not going to tempt fate." 

 We finished up and got up and left. As I rode up in the elevator I remembered my last time in that very same elevator and I felt the heat build up between my legs. My fingers were going to be busy that night, but then my pussy was very familiar with my fingers. It was all the poor thing had had since I stupidly told Rob about my pregnancy and then dropped the bomb on him that it wasn't his. I was living proof that honesty was not always the best policy. 

 I started undressing and when I was down to my thigh highs I put my heels back on and looked at myself in the floor length mirror. I looked pretty good for a pregnant broad. I turned and looked at myself from several angles and thought "What a waste." It was a crying shame that only my fingers would get to play with me. I was just turning away from the mirror when there was a knock on my door. There was no peep hole so I put on my robe, hooked the safety chain on the door and then opened it and looked through the gap. I saw Stu standing there. He was smiling and he said: 

 "I saw you in the restaurant and I checked with the front desk to see if you were checked in. You going to invite me in?" 

 I closed the door, unhooked the chain, opened the door and stepped back to let him in. I closed the door and turned to face him. 

 "Glad to see me?" 

 I thought of my husband and the fact that he didn't want me and so I gave Stu the most direct answer I could think of. I didn't say a word; just let my robe slip from my shoulders and fall to the floor. He smiled and began taking off his shirt and I moved to him and went to my knees in front of him. I unbuckled his belt, pulled down his zipper and worked his pants and boxers down to his ankles and then I leaned forward and took his already hard cock in my mouth. After a couple of minutes he pulled me up and led me to the bed. I started to kick my heels off, but he told me to leave them on. 

 "It makes you look both sexy and slutty." 

 I moaned with pleasure as his hard cock pushed into me and I pulled my knees back to give him better access (and to get more of him in me). My hands went to his butt and I pulled him to me and then we just fucked. We fucked doggie, missionary, cowgirl and reverse cowgirl. I sucked his cock and he ate my pussy and he had my ass. I hadn't liked it all that much the last time we did it, but somehow this time it seemed fitting that the 'slut' take it with a smile. He took his time and I actually liked it enough to ask him to do me there again in the morning. 

 The morning? Oh yes. He stayed with me until one o'clock the next afternoon and when he left my room I was one satisfied lady. At one point he said: 

 "I see that the good life is catching up with you" and he pointed at the slight bulge of my stomach. "It is sexy. Good food?"  

 

 

===

"Afraid not. A very bad man." 

 "A very bad man? Who?" 

 "You. I'm pregnant and it is yours." 

 "You're kidding." 

 "No I'm not. I've only been with two men -- my husband and you -- and the timing was such that it couldn't have been Rob." 

 I explained the going to start a family and then going off birth control and how the heat of our last meeting made me forget that I wasn't protected. I told him about how Rob had been called away on business and my fertile time was over before he got back and was able to make love to me again. He laughed and said: 

 "You call me bad? What about you? Having my kid and letting poor hubby think he is going to be a daddy." 

 "He knows." 

 "He does? And he is okay with it?" 

 "I wasn't that lucky. I thought that maybe he loved me enough, but he didn't and we are apart now." 

 He looked at me in silence for several seconds and then said, "Wow! Me a daddy. That will take some getting used to. You getting a divorce?" 

 "Not until after the baby is born. The judges won't rule until the paternity issue is resolved." 

 "Why is that?" 

 "Child support. He won't have to pay any if he can prove the baby isn't his and they won't take his word for it." 

 "So you tell them." 

 "They won't take my word either. They believe I might lie just to get out of the marriage. As far as the courts are concerned our divorce doesn't mean squat. The welfare of the child is their only concern and nothing is going to happen until they know for sure that Rob isn't the father." 

 "What are you going to do after the divorce?" 

 "Cope." 

 He looked at his watch. What time is your flight?" 

 "Two-thirty." 

 "We have a lot of time then." 

 I smiled and lowered my head to his cock. After Stu had gone and I was taking a shower I convinced myself that I wouldn't have let Stu in the room if Rob and I were still together. At least I think I convinced myself. 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

I was sitting in a booth eating breakfast when Dixie sat down opposite me. 

 "How we doing Rob?" 

 "Day to day Dixie, day to day." 

 "You about ready to give me another shot at you?" 

 I looked at her and remembered what we once had and my dick started to harden. "Why not?" I thought. It has been months and I certainly didn't owe Ellen any degree of faithfulness. 

 "What do you have in mind?" 

 "Bob Thomas and the Highway Travelers are at the Stagecoach. How about Mexican for dinner and then some 'two stepping' for a while?" 

 "Pick you up at seven?" 

 "Works for me." 

 As we ate dinner at El Mason the conversation wandered all over the place, but never got anywhere near the 'elephant' in the room -- Ellen. We had a great time dancing at the Stagecoach and then hit Denny's for pie and enough coffee to dilute the alcohol in my blood. When we left Denny's as soon as we were in the car Dixie slid over next to me, took my head in her hands and kissed me. That kiss turned into a steamy make-out session that ended when Dixie said: 

 "Take me home Rob. Hurry up and get me home." 

 She had her hand on the hard bulge in my pants all the way to her place, but by the time we got to her door I was suffering a severe case of conscience. Dixie opened the door, but I just couldn't go in. She gave me a confused look and I said: 

 "I'm sorry Dixie, I really am. I want to and I've looked forward to it all day, but I just can't. I'm still married and unlike some people I have to honor my vows until that marriage is ended. I'm sorry honey, I want to but I just can't." 

 She reached out and tenderly touched my cheek and said, "There will be another time Rob. I was looking forward to it too, but I can wait. I'll be here when you are ready, but don't be a stranger. I like you as a dance partner and I love Mexican okay?" 

 "You got it Dixie and thank you." 

 "For what?" 

 "For being understanding." 

 --------------------------- 

 It was a lot harder than I ever thought it would be. It was bad enough loving Ellen and missing her, but having to see her almost every day at work was a killer. We didn't talk, but I would see her in the halls, the lunch room or walking across the parking lot. Ellen was seven months pregnant and I'm sure that there was a lot of speculation among our co-workers as to why Ellen and I were on the outs, but I never told anyone and I'm pretty sure that Ellen didn't either. 

 The one thing I never expected was how much of a turn on a pregnant Ellen could be. She positively glowed and radiated sexuality. It would have been so easy for me to just walk over to her office in the east wing or call her at her parents, but I just could not bring myself to do it. I could not get by what she was carrying in her body. 

 I was dating Dixie on weekends and it was getting harder and harder for me to walk away from her when I took her home. Why she put up with it I'll never know. I was getting closer and closer to the point where I would finally say to hell with it. When Ellen broke her vows to me she released me from mine and that point was probably going to be reached on the coming Saturday night. 

 It was Thursday and I was busy fixing myself dinner and thinking about my upcoming date with Dixie when the door bell rang. It was Ellen's mother. I invited Rose in and asked her if she had eaten yet and she said she hadn't, but wasn't hungry. 

 "If you have any wine I'll sip it while you eat." 

 I poured her a glass of white wine and when she sat down I said, "Okay Rose, lets have it." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Come on Rose. When was the last time that you came over here just to visit me?" 

 "You're right. I guess I should get right to it. Ellen made a terrible mistake Rob and she knows it. She loves you Rob and she needs you. I know what your position is and I can understand and sympathize, but do you really want to end what the two of you had before she got stupid? You were both the best thing to happen to each other. You were the perfect couple. You belong together Rob." 

 "I'm sorry Rose, but every time I see her with..." 

 "Forget that Rob. From what Ellen has told me I can guess that the two of you didn't sit down and discuss things. Ellen made an assumption, confessed and then you shut her out of your life. Neither one of you even considered that Ellen could be wrong. It is not cast in bronze that a woman can only get pregnant at an exact certain time. Granted that there are times when a woman is most fertile, but the key word there is 'most'. There is a point in a woman's cycle when she is 'most' fertile, but that is not the only time. 

 "Ellen assumed that she could only have gotten pregnant on a few certain days and that she didn't make love to you on those certain days you couldn't be the father. She could be dead wrong on that Rob. I would say that the chances that the baby she is carrying is yours are fifty/fifty. Given that knowledge you could easily go through life accepting that the child is yours. You would never even know for sure unless you had tests done. Why do that? Talk to a doctor and satisfy yourself that what I have just said is true and once satisfied accept that the child is yours, get back with Ellen and get on with your life. You know that after this you will never have to worry about her again, right?" 

 She finished her wine and stood up. "All I'm asking Rob is that you at least think about it." 

 She left and left me with a lot to think about. I didn't need to talk with a doctor about what she had just said. I knew lots of people who ended up with children they had not planned on. I knew several couples who for religious reasons used the rhythm method for birth control only to end up with kids. I had always known that, but I had never considered it because Ellen had been sure of the fact that the father of the baby was the man she had cheated on me with. 

 The fact that Rose was right in what she said changed a few things in my mind. I still loved Ellen and the only thing that was keeping us apart was the fact that I knew I would never be able to live with the constant reminder of her infidelity. True, the infidelity would still be there, but I could probably eventually get by it if the fruits of it were not constantly in my face. The big question now became could I convince myself to take a pass on the DNA test and just accept the child as mine. I wasn't dumb. I knew if I did that there would still be the thought of "is it or isn't it" in my mind, but would that thought be insistent enough to cause problems later on? There was no way of knowing of course so the question became did I love Ellen enough to take the chance? Those thoughts put a damper on my date with Dixie. We did have a good time, but it didn't end in her bed. I guess I still had not reached the "she did so I can" point. 

 ---------------------- 

 The phone rang and I picked it up. "Purchasing. This is Ellen." 

 "And a good morning to you sexy momma." 

 "Stu?" 

 "The one and the same. I'm in town and I'd like to take you to lunch." 

 "I don't think that would be a good idea." 

 "Why not?" 

 "I'm afraid of what might happen if some one sees us together and tells my husband." 

 "You back together with him?" 

 "Not yet, but I haven't given up hope." 

 "Surely having lunch with me won't cause a problem. All anyone seeing us would think is that you were having a business lunch with a customer. What harm could they see in that." 

 "I guess you are right. What time and where?" 

 "How about the Red Robin on Forester. Say noonish?" 

 "Okay. I'll see you there." 

 --------------------- 

 "Oh God! Sweet Jesus yes! Fuck me, fuck me" reverberated off the motel room walls as Stu slammed his cock into me. I was on my knees with my breasts and big belly hanging down. I had already cum twice and Stu had me close to a third time when he groaned and filled me with his cream. 

 "No, no" I cried, "Don't stop, I'm almost there, don't stop." 

 Stu quickly pulled out of me and went to work on my clit with his fingers until I had my orgasm. When I had settled down Stu wrapped his arms around me and said: 

 "Banging you that hard doesn't hurt my little guy does it?" 

 "No, but it hurts me. I may not be able to walk out of here under my own power." 

 "I don't know if I've told you this, but you are the sexiest looking and best - - absolute best -- piece of ass I've ever had. What would you think about making it permanent?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "How about you and me when you get your divorce?" 

 "You can't be serious. We don't know anything about each other. All we've had up till now is three meetings for sex. I'll grant you that it has been great sex, but that is hardly enough to build a relationship on." 

 "How about the fact that you are the mother of my child? Shouldn't I be able to be there so I can be a good dad?" 

 "I'm still in love with my husband Stu and I haven't given up hope yet where he is concerned." 

 "Get serious honey. He hasn't had anything to do with you since the day you told him about my kid. If he hasn't come around by now it isn't going to happen." 

 "I'll just have to wait and see." 

 "While we are waiting I could go again if you were to put your magic mouth to work." 

 "Magic mouth huh?" 

 "Oh yeah. It does amazing things to me." 

 I smiled at him and then bent to take him in my mouth. Maybe it was magic because he certainly recovered quickly. After another very satisfying session he said: 

 "Can we go out for dinner and maybe some dancing tonight?" 

 "I don't think so and for the same reason I didn't originally want to do lunch with you." 

 "So what if word does get back to your husband? He hasn't had anything to do with you for months. Maybe hearing that you aren't sitting at home staring at the walls will goad him into doing something." 

 "I thought you were hoping for an "us." If being out together makes him pay more attention to me aren't you defeating your purpose by taking me out?" 

 "I'm hoping that if he does take notice that whatever he does will end up working in my favor." 

 "I don't guess I have anything to lose do I." 

 As we talked his fingers were working on my pussy and he got me worked up to where I pushed him back on the bed and swung over him in a sixty-nine. That led to more exercise in the doggie position. I was already late in going back to work so I called in and took the rest of the day off and spent it with Stu in his motel room. 

 We were sitting at a table at Mario's. Dinner was over and Stu was still trying to talk me into committing to a relationship when and if Rob divorced me. I kept telling him that I was a long way from giving up on Rob and I wasn't all that sure I'd give up even if we got a divorce. 

 "That makes no sense Ellen. He hasn't had anything to do with you in months and here I am wanting you. To me it is a no brainer." 

 "You are the one not making sense Stu. Outside of me being what you say is the best piece of ass you've ever had you know nothing at all about me other than I'm a woman who cheated on her husband with you. All we have had is three widely separated rolls in the hay. The first was a huge mistake on my part and the next only happened because I'm a super horny broad who hasn't been touched by her husband in almost eight months. I don't know you well enough to know if I even like you enough to want to spend some time with. You are great in bed, but that is all I know about you and for me that just isn't enough to build a relationship on." 

 There were several people in the restaurant that knew me and Rob and I suddenly noticed that they were all looking our way, but not at us. I looked over my shoulder and then turned back to Stu. 

 "No fear of anyone seeing us and getting the word back to Rob." 

 "Why is that?" 

 "He is sitting at a table behind us." 

 He looked past me and said, "Which one." 

 "You can't miss him. He is the one sitting with the busty redhead." 

 He took another look and then said, "Well, there you have it. He has moved on so it is time for you to move on too. Want dessert or should we head back for the motel so you can start learning enough about me to want to spend time with me." 

 "No more motel. I'm staying with my parents and I'm no where near ready for what I'd get from them if I didn't come home." 

 ---------------------------- 

 I saw Ellen right away when Dixie and I walked into the restaurant. She was sitting with a guy and while they weren't holding hands or touching I could sense that there was something between them. I didn't like the way he was looking at Ellen and I felt a twinge of something -- anger or jealousy or maybe a mixture of both -- because she was with another man. Stupid of me and I knew it; after all, wasn't I there with another woman? 

 I tried to pull my eyes away from Ellen and the man and pay attention to Dixie, but it was hard to do and of course Dixie noticed it. She didn't say anything, but I could read it in her face. And then she said: 

 "I don't think he is local; at least I've never seen him before have you?" 

 "Have I what?" 

 "Ever seen the man with Ellen before." 

 "No, I can't say that I have." 

 "Maybe he is someone in town to do business with your company and it is a working dinner." 

 "Yeah, sure; that's probably what it is." 

 But I knew it wasn't. I don't know how I knew, but I did. I wondered if Rose knew what she was talking about when she said Ellen was pinning away for me. They were apparently finished eating because they got up to leave. Ellen glanced our way and I might have been mistaken, but thought she gave me a little smile. 

 It was a week day night and other than having dinner together Dixie and I had nothing else planned so I got her home early. I started to get out of the car to walk her to her door, but she stopped me. 

 "Don't get out Rob. What you need to do is get yourself home and sit down and have a long talk with yourself. You need to decide what you are going to do where Ellen is concerned. It is time for you to shit or get off the pot Rob. Call me when you know." 

 She got out of the car and as I watched her walk to her door I knew she was right. I had finally figured out what the twinge was that I had felt when I saw Ellen sitting with that man in the restaurant. I was pissed because another man was with MY wife. MY wife! I had to own up to it. I still thought of Ellen as my wife. 

 The next day at work I called her office. 

 "Purchasing. This is Ellen." 

 "Are you free for lunch?" 

 There was dead silence for maybe five seconds and then Ellen said, "Yes, I can do lunch." 

 "I'll meet you in the parking lot at twelve." 

 Once in the car she sat there silent as if she was afraid that her speaking would chase me away so I opened the ball. 

 "I need to know why you are so sure that the baby isn't mine. Maybe we didn't make love on the prime days -- your most fertile -- but when we finally did make love it wasn't all that far out of the range. Why are you so sure that I'm not the father?" 

 "I just assumed that since what I did happened during my most fertile period that you weren't the father." 

 "But I could be. And there is also the possibility that the man you were with is sterile or maybe he has a low sperm count and his sperm couldn't get the job done." 

 "Why are you telling me all this?" 

 "The last several months that I've been without you I have been miserable. I love you, but what you are carrying in your body is what is keeping us apart. If there were any chance at all that it was mine we could maybe work on putting what you did behind us. It wouldn't be easy and it might take some time, but we could try. What is in the way of my even trying is your certainty that I'm not the father." 

 "When you put it that way I'm not sure at all. You are right. It could be yours; I just never considered it." 

 By then we were at the restaurant and nothing more on that subject was mentioned until after we had given our order and then Ellen said: 

 "So there is a chance for us if the DNA test shows that you are the father?" 

 "No Ellen, that is not what I said." 

 "But you..." 

 "Let me finish. What I said was that as long as there was a chance we could try." 

 "But there is a cha..." 

 "Please let me finish Ellen. I said there might be a chance for us if there was a chance the child is mine. If you admit there is a chance then that is all that I need. As long as we both -- both Ellen -- think there is a chance I can try. There won't be a DNA test because that would tell us for sure and if it turned out that I wasn't the father there would be no chance for us at all. Do you understand what I'm saying?" 

 "You could do that? You could go through life as the child's father and never really knowing for sure?" 

 "I don't know Ellen. That's why I said we could work at it and that it wouldn't be easy. It may not work out, but I've found that I love you enough to at least try." 

 She stared at me for a bit and then she surprised me. I thought she would leap at the chance, but she said: 

 "I'll need some time to think about this Rob" and before I could say anything the waitress walked up with our order. 

 We ate in silence and when lunch was over and we were heading back to work Ellen said: 

 "I didn't give you the answer you expected did I?" 

 "No Ellen, no you didn't." 

 "I love you Rob, so much that it hurts, but for the last eight months I resigned myself to the fact that I had lost you. Yes, I know that it was my own fault, but that had nothing to do with accepting that you were gone and learning to live with it. Now you are saying we should get back together and see if "maybe" we can make it work. No guarantees, just a maybe. I don't know that I can do that Rob. If we get back together and it doesn't work out I don't know that I can go through losing you again. I want to Rob, God knows I want to, but I just don't think I can go through what I've gone through these last eight months all over again." 

 "I'm sorry Ellen, but that's the best I can offer. I can't promise anything but that I will try." 

 The rest of the ride was in silence and when we got back to work she headed for her office and I headed for the warehouse. 

 ----------------------- 

 "Purchasing. This is Ellen." 

 "How you doing sexy momma?" 

 "Stu?" 

 "I'm in town on business again baby. Can we do lunch?" 

 "No, I don't think so." 

 "Why not? You certainly do seem to like being with me." 

 "I'm probably going to get back with my husband." 

 "So? What does that have to do with having lunch with a friend?" 

 "Are you a friend Stu? I don't think a friend would try and mess up a woman's happiness." 

 "You always seemed happy when we got together." 

 "The first time was a huge mistake Stu. The next three times I had been without sex for a long time and I was horny as a goat." 

 "So you are back in his bed?" 

 "Not yet, but it is close." 

 "Then you should still be horny and good buddy Stu is here to help you out." 

 "I can't take the chance Stu." 

 "Can't take the chance? That means you want to but are scared hubby will find out." 

 "No Stu, that isn't what I mean." 

 "Well we need to get together anyway to talk about my kid." 

 "What do you mean talk about your kid?" 

 "You think I'm going to walk away from my child? No way." 

 "What do you want Stu?" 

 "Denny's on Evans at twelve. Be there." 

 "That's it baby, suck that cock. You are the absolute best. Your idiot husband doesn't deserve you and yes he is an idiot if he could walk away from that mouth and the best pussy I've ever had." 

 I took my mouth off of him long enough to say, "The quickest way to get this mouth to leave is to keep bad-mouthing my husband." 

 "Can't help it babe, it is true. Even at eight months pregnant you are still the sexiest woman I've ever seen. How could any man in his right mind let you go?" 

 "I'm serious Stu; leave him alone. The only reason you are where you are right now is that I haven't been laid since the last time you were here and being pregnant has made me even hornier than I usually am. Settle for what you have Stu and if you want me to stay you will not mention Rob again. Are we clear on that?"  

 

 

===

"You sure know how to take the romance out of things." 

 "There is no romance here Stu' just hot sex. Don't ever think that there is any more going than that." 

 By then I had him hard again and I moved into the doggie position which was the only comfortable position for my eight month pregnant body and as Stu lid his cock in me for the third time that afternoon I thought about the meeting that had led me to the motel room. Stu had been waiting in a booth when I got to the Denny's and after a few pleasantries I asked: 

 "What did you mean when you said you weren't going to walk away from your child?" 

 "I intend to be a part of my child's life. We need to discuss how to accomplish that. Visitation and all that." 

 "I decided that the baby isn't yours. I refigured my calendar and I'm almost certain that my hubby is the one who got the deed done." 

 "Almost certain isn't good enough for me. Up till now you were certain that the kid was mine. The DNA will tell us." 

 "There isn't going to be a DNA test." 

 "I'm afraid that I will have to insist." 

 "Insist all you want. There will be no DNA test. You have no standing to ask for one." 

 "Of course I do. You made love to me during your fertile period and told me that I was the father. I'll present those facts and ask for a determination of paternity." 

 "In the first place we did not make love. All we did was enjoy some sex. The only man I've ever made love with is my husband. I'll dent that you and I ever did anything but talk." 

 "Deny all you want. I'll just point out that your hubby put your ass out when you told him you were pregnant. That will create reasonable doubt. I'll get my test." 

 "And that will totally screw up any chance that Rob and I would have of getting back together. Why would you do that to me?" 

 "I want you, but you won't dump a husband that doesn't care enough about you to even talk to you during what has to be one of the most trying times of your life. Well, I can't have you, but I can claim a part of you. The child will be my connection to what I want, but can't have." 

 "You don't care about the baby at all. You are just trying to find a way to fuck me." 

 He just looked at me and smiled. 

 He was an asshole, but God was he ever good in bed. 

 --------------------- 

 Ellen called me and told me that even if it didn't work out and turned bad on her she knew she had to try. I spent the weekend moving her back into the house. The first night was awkward. When it was bedtime we walked up the stairs and Ellen turned toward the spare bedroom and I stopped her. I took her hand and led her to our bedroom. I undressed and she watched and then said: 

 "I sleep naked now. Nightgowns and pajamas are uncomfortable on my body." 

 I shrugged and got into bed. She stripped and tentatively approached the bed. The look on her face told me that she didn't know what to expect and was somewhat apprehensive. I held my arms open and she got in and moved next to me and as I held her she cried softly into my shoulder. 

 I woke up in the morning to warmth around my cock and I looked down to see that Ellen had me in her mouth. My cock was hard and Ellen looked at me. 

 "Please baby? It has been so long and I need you." 

 We made love several more times over the next two days. Ellen had taken maternity leave starting ten days before her due date and one night at dinner I asked her if she had decided on a name for the baby. She hadn't wanted to know the sex of the child before birth so she didn't know if it was going to be a boy or a girl. She looked at me and said: 

 "Of course I have. The baby will be named after its daddy. Robert if it is a boy and Roberta if it's a girl." 

 Two days after telling me that her water broke and I rushed her to the hospital. It was a boy and he came in at seven pounds and seven ounces. While Ellen was in the recovery room the nurse at the nurse's station asked me for information for the birth certificate and I told them the infants name would be Robert Bartlett Clanton Junior and when they asked the name of the father I said "Robert Bartlett Clanton Senior and it was done. I had accepted the child as mine. 

 ------------------------ 

 The next six weeks were a learning experience for me. I never had brothers or sisters so I had never been around babies and everything was new to me. Ellen was whipped so I helped out when it came to getting out of bed at oh-dark- thirty to feed the baby and I learned how to change the little bugger and I swear that all he did was eat, sleep and shit. 

 It was maybe three weeks after the baby arrived when it dawned on me that not once had I looked at the baby and wondered "Are you really mine?" It looked like Ellen and I had a better than 'good' shot at making it. 

 She came home from her six week checkup and called me at work and told me to be prepared for some exercise when I got home. It was a very satisfying night in one respect, but a little upsetting in another. The doctor had cleared Ellen for having sex, but he also cleared her for going back to work. I wasn't too sure how I felt about that. It was her job that put her where she fell prey to what happened that caused us so much grief. Once she was traveling again could I trust her? It turned out that it wasn't the baby that might hurt our budding relationship, but my trust in Ellen. But before that trust could be put to the test I received good news. Ellen wouldn't be traveling any more. 

 ------------------------ 

 One of the benefits of working for Wayman Industries is that they had an on site daycare center for employees. On my first day back to work, after all the 'oohs and ahhs' over little Robbie I settled in to try and catch up on what had happened while I was gone. My work load had been spit between three others, but even though they were capable they didn't do things the way I did so things were not going to be the way I wanted and I was going to have to make adjustments. 

 By three I had things back the way I wanted them and I was working on my calendar for the coming week when the boss's secretary called me and told me that Jeff wanted to see me. He pointed to a chair when I walked in to his office and I took a seat. 

 "How was your first day back?" 

 "Busy." 

 "How do you feel about finding out that everything you did today was a waste of time?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Samson turned in his notice. His father died and his mother is in bad shape so he is moving back east to stay with her. I'm assuming that you would like the promotion and the increase in pay. And it means an end to your traveling. Of course you are free to say no." 

 "Are you kidding? Say No? I'd have to be terminally stupid to say no." 

 "I'm giving Cindy Meyers your old job so you will need to make one last trip to break her in. Plan on moving into Sampson's office the week after next." 

 ---------------------- 

 Cindy and I had dinner with Elise at the Hilton after spending the afternoon going through her shop. The three of us had a few deinks in the lounge and then Elise left to go home to her husband and kids. Cindy and I had one more drink and then headed for our rooms. 

 I had just finished undressing and was getting ready to go to bed when there was a knock on the door. I doubted that it was Cindy -- she would have just picked up the phone and called me from her room -- so I was betting that I knew who it was. I put my robe on and went to the door. I put the security chain on the door and opened it. Sure enough, it was Stu. 

 "My spies told me that you were here. The deal you made was that you were supposed to call me whenever you came to town." 

 The deal I had made with Stu was that I would have sex with him whenever I was in his town as long as he stayed away from the baby and didn't do anything to derail my marriage. The deal was that it would only happen in his town and never in mine. And here he was expecting to collect. 

 But I knew something that he didn't know. Rob might have wanted to stay in the dark about the baby being afraid that the DNA test might show that he wasn't the father, but I wasn't Rob and I did want to know. I kept watching Rob's hairbrush until I found a few of his hairs with the follicles still attached. I took them in with a swab from little Robbie's cheek and ten days later I knew that Rob was indeed little Robbie's father. Stu could demand a DNA test all he wanted and it wouldn't matter. It would upset Rob, but when he found out that Stu wasn't the daddy he would get over it. 

 I was all set to tell Stu to take a hike when he reached into his pocket as he said: 

 "No more accidents" and he brought out a strip of condoms. I looked at them dangling from his fingers and thought "This is my last trip and he is damned good in bed and I would never see him again. I smiled at him, shrugged my shoulders and let the robe slide off me and down onto the floor and I struck a pose for him, pushing my still fat milk laden tits out at him and then closed the door. I unhooked the security chain and let him hear it rattle against the door. I could just imagine the anticipation on his face. 

 I turned and headed to the bed. I had Rob back and no way was I ever going to risk losing him again. I did wonder how long Stu would stand there before giving it up as a lost cause. Report_Story
