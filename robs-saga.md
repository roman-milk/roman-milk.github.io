 ****** Rob's Saga Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© It is October and that means that it is time for the annual Just Plain Bob Invitational. I am constantly bombarded with comments saying things like "You call that a story? My ten year old can do better than that." Also heard a lot is "If that were my story xxxxx would have xxxxxxx and xxxxx would have xxxx." So here is everyone's chance to show me how it should really be done. Step up and put an ending to this story. There is only one rule. You must state in your opening that your story is a continuation of my story. 

 Editor's Note: you must also put your story in the Chain Stories category and title it "Rob's Saga: YOURSUBTITLEHERE", where YOURSUBTITLEHERE is a short (1- 3 words) subtitle. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 It had been a long day. A 'brown out' had slowed things down at work and it couldn't have happened at a worst time. The production run was already behind and we were up against a hard deadline. The contract had penalties for failure to deliver on time and we would have to work overtime on the weekend if we were to have any chance at all of meeting the deadline. 

 I was looking forward to a cold beer on the living room couch as I caught the news on CNN. There was a Harley in the driveway just behind Audrey's Hondo Civic and I wondered who it might belong to. I walked into the living room and found Audrey sitting on the couch with some guy who looked just like the typical 'biker' that you see portrayed in the movies and on TV. A vest with all kinds of badges, pins and patches over a shirt with the sleeves torn off. Jeans, engineer boots completed the costume. His arms and hands were covered with tattoos and even without seeing them I would bet that he had a "hate" tattoo on his left hand and a "love" tattoo on his right. 

 Audrey stood up as I walked into the room and said, "Good. Now we can get this over with." 

 "Get what over with Aud?" 

 "I'm leaving you Rob." 

 That came as a surprise to me as I'd not seen any indication of her dissatisfaction with me or our marriage. I looked at the guy sitting on the couch and smirking at me while holding a beer that I'd bet came from my stock in the fridge. I nodded toward him and said: 

 "With this piece of shit?" 

 He didn't like that and he started to get up. I ignored him and said to Audrey: 

 "Good luck with your new life." 

 I didn't waste any time with "Why?" or "What have I done?" or any of that other bullshit. If she was leaving and had asshole there to hold her hand it meant that she had already stabbed me in the back and cheated on me with him so she was history in my books. I turned to go to the kitchen and get me a beer and then the biker said: 

 "That's it? Your bitch tells you she is dumping your ass and all you say is have a nice life? Oh well, she said you would be a wimp." 

 I turned and looked at Audrey. "Did you say that? Did you tell asshole here that I was a wimp?" 

 Audrey looked away from me and I had my answer. I turned to the asshole and hit him. It caught him by surprise. Wimps aren't supposed to get violent, right? He shook it off and came after me. He must have been still thinking of me as a wimp because he didn't use any caution at all. He just rushed at me. I kicked the inside of his right knee and drove it outward and he screamed and went down as the knee gave way. I kicked him twice in the stones, lifted him up and slammed him against the wall and then I beat the living shit out of him. The entire time Audrey was screaming, "Stop it, stop it" but I ignored her. When I got tired I let him slump to the floor. I looked over at Audrey and said: 

 "How's that for being wimpy Aud?" 

 I grabbed asshole by his feet and drug him outside and left him lying on the driveway next to his bike and then I went into the garage and got the half inch drive breaker bar and a screwdriver out of my tool box and went back to where the asshole was lying on the ground and moaning. I used the breaker bar to bust every light on the bike and then I carved "The wimp did this" into the paint on his gas tank. 

 I went back into the house and found Audrey sitting on the couch crying and I said: 

 "I hope you know how to ride his bike because I don't think he is in shape to do it." 

 "I can't drive a motorcycle. I'm taking my car." 

 "Oh no you aren't" I said as I grabbed her purse and dumped it out on the coffee table. I picked up her keys as I said "That car still has my name on the title and we still owe on it. I don't trust you to make the payments and I'll be damned if I'm going to let you ruin my credit." 

 Then I noticed the white envelope with First National Bank on it and I picked it up and looked inside. It was stuffed with money. I took my cell phone off my belt and hit the speed dial number for the bank. I punched in our account number and the mechanical voice said: 

 "Your checking account balance is six dollars and thirteen cents. Press two for withdrawal information. Press three for..." 

 I disconnected and snarled, "You bitch. You fucking whore! A house payment due, a car payment due and you cleaned me out and were going to leave me here holding the bag." 

 I picked up her wallet and took everything out of it except her driver's license and tossed it to her. 

 "Get out. Get your worthless ass out of here before I lose it and do to you what I did to that asshole you brought into my house." 

 "All my things are in the car." 

 "I'll clean the car out and dump your shit in the driveway. Anything still there on trash day will go out on the curb with the rest of the garbage now get the fuck out of here." 

 She walked out the door sniffling and sobbing and I went to the fridge to get another beer. As I pulled the tab on the can I had a thought so I set the beer down on the kitchen table and went back outside. Audrey was digging through the car for something and the biker was sitting up, leaning against his bike and retching. I walked up and looked down at him. 

 "I know your type asshole. I know just what you are going to do. You are going to round up some buddies and come back here to show me that I can't fuck with you and get away with it. I know you are going to do it and so I'll be watching out for you. I'm warning you now that if I see your ass again I'll do more than just beat the fuck out of you. Remember that asshole. You have been warned." 

 I went back into the house and about a half hour later I heard the Harley start up and drive off. 

 I was in the living room getting asshole's empty beer can off of the coffee table when I noticed a leather jacket lying on the floor next to the couch. I picked it up and on the back was painted a skull and the words "Diablo Riders." I looked at it for a few seconds and then I called my cousin Lou who was a sergeant on the local police force and asked him if he knew anything about the Diablo Riders. 

 "Only that they are a bunch of bad mother fuckers. They are into dope dealing and prostitution, but we haven't been able to hang anything on them. Why do you want to know about them? 

 I told him and he laughed. "I guess I know what Audrey will be doing this time next week. They'll have her hooked on something and she will be out on the streets making money for them. But you have a problem cuz. They can't allow what you did to go unavenged. It might give other people ideas." 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 I was watching the pregame show on Monday night football when the call came. I turned off the TV and went out and sat down on the front porch swing. Just a little over an hour later a car and two pick up trucks pulled up in front of the house and seven guys got out. One of them was asshole and I was pleased to see that he was walking with a cane. They came up the walk and I went down off the porch to meet them. One of them, a big ugly bearded dude said: 

 "You fucked up man. You don't mess with one of our guys and get away with it." 

 "I would suggest that you get off my property and do it now." 

 "Oh we will be going shit face, but not until after we teach you a lesson." 

 Two men moved in on me, one on each side and then the ugly dude swung at me. I didn't try to avoid the punch; I just stood there and took it. All hell broke loose as cops came spilling out of the house and garage and police cars with lights flashing and sirens going roared up the street and pulled up in front of the house. It all distracted the ugly dude and I speared him in the throat with the stiffened fingers of my right hand. At the same time I kicked the right knee of the guy on my right and he went down. The guy on my left was already running, but he didn't get far before two cops had him on the ground and were cuffing him. 

 Ugly dude lay at my feet gasping for breath and the other guy was clutching his knee and moaning. The rest of the group were all in handcuffs and being led away. All except asshole. He was standing there leaning on his cane as he watched his buds being loaded into the back of cop cars. My cousin Lou and another officer led him into the garage, sat him down on a chair and then cuffed him to it. Lou showed me two small cellophane bags and said: 

 "We found this on him. It is enough to take him down for possession with intent to sell. What do you want me to do?" 

 "Dump it or lose it. I don't want him in jail. I want him out where I can get to him." 

 Lou handed me the keys to the handcuffs and then he and the other officer left. I walked over to my tool box and brought out the half inch drive breaker bar and then walked back over to stand in front of asshole. I stood there lightly tapping my palm with the breaker bar and then said: 

 "They call this a breaker bar because it can usually break loose a stubborn nut or bolt. But you might remember that it can also break things. Remember the lights on your scooter? Remember what I told you the last time I saw you? I told you that if I ever saw you again I'd do more than just beat the fuck out of you, but you didn't listen did you. Did you see the punch that your buddy threw at me? Did you see me just stand there and take it? That was the price I had to pay to get you in this chair. I had to take that punch so it could be caught on tape to show just cause for the cops to take down your friends. Maybe they will thank you for giving them the opportunity to spend some time in jail. Think?" 

 I swung the breaker bar at his right knee as hard as I could and he screamed. I grabbed a shop towel from my work bench and forced it into his mouth to quiet him down and then I beat his right knee into mush. He had passed out from the pain so he was dead weight when I loaded him into the back of my pick up. I drove to a park just outside of town, pulled him out of the truck and dropped him by the pay phone just outside the public toilets. I checked his pockets to make sure that he had enough change to call for help and when I saw he didn't I put two quarters in his pocket. 

 I woke him up with some smelling salts and when I had his attention I told him: 

 "I warned you last time and you ignored it. You can ignore this warning too if you want to and it won't bother me at all. You like western movies? You know the part where one guy says to the other "This town isn't big enough for both of us. You have until sundown to get out of town?" That's where we are now. Here's the deal. You need to leave this town and never come back. In two weeks I'm going to start looking for you and if I find you, depending on the mood I'm in, I'll either kill you or put you in a wheelchair for the rest of your life and you will be taking all of your meals through a straw. One last thing. What happened to you tonight didn't come from me. Call whoever you want and file any complaint you feel like, but I have five cops who will swear that I was playing cards with them. Remember. Two weeks and I come looking." 

 I left him there and drove home. 

 Lou called me in the morning. The biker's vehicles had dope and weapons galore in them. Three of the bikers had guns on them and two of the gun totters were on parole so they were on their way back to prison. Two were carrying knives longer than the law allowed and all of them had dope on them. They were all going to be going to jail for a while. 

 "The Tri-County Drug Task Force owes you and they told me to tell you that they have you covered." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "What it means is that unless you do something totally stupid you will probably never again get a ticket in the Tri-County area in this life." 

 Two days later he called me again. "I talked with Audrey last night. She is staying with her sister. I told her what she almost got herself into and she said that she already knew and that is why she is at her sisters. Seems that after the boys headed for your place to pay you a visit some of the girls in the clubhouse clued her in and she split and went to her sisters. She asked me to call you and ask you if she could come home and talk to you." 

 "No thanks cuz. She said it all when she told me she was leaving me and when I found out she had cleaned out the bank account it was all over." 

 "Okay Rob, just passing a message. Be careful. There are still a couple of Diablo Riders still out there. They aren't really hardcore which is why they weren't with the bunch that came to visit, but better safe than sorry. Given your good standing with the Task Force we could probably get you a concealed carry permit if you want." 

 "Thanks Lou; I'll have to think on that." 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Two weeks went by and one night when I came home from looking for asshole I found a woman sitting on my front porch steps. She stood up as I approached and I saw that she was a sexy looking woman although in a hard way if you know what I mean. I'm no judge of tit size, but hers were substantial and the tank top she was wearing showed plenty of cleavage. About five foot six, dishwater blond hair and she filled out her jeans nicely and altogether she looked like a lady I wouldn't mind playing with. The only thing I saw that I didn't care for were the tattoos she had. She had the 'barbed wire' one on her left arm and what looked like a bunch of flowers on her right arm at the shoulder. She probably had a couple more that I couldn't see. I walked up to her and asked: 

 "What can I do for you?" 

 "I just had to come by and get a look at the man who was bad enough to chase DJ out of town." 

 "And you are?" 

 "I was DJ's squeeze. I don't know if I should kiss you for making him leave or kick you in the balls." 

 "Why the big spread?" 

 "On the one hand I'm glad he's gone, but on the other it screws me up big time." 

 "How's that?" 

 "The rent is due and he split with the money. We've been late a couple of times before and the landlord said that the next time we were late we were out. Oh well, it won't be the first time we have had to sleep in the car." 

 She looked me up and down and the said, "Amazing. You don't look anything at all like a hard ass." 

 She started to walk away and I called out "Hey!" She turned back to me and I said: 

 "Don't leave me in suspense here. The kick or the kiss?" 

 She smiled, walked back to me, put her arms around me and kissed me. "Thanks" she said as she turned to go and I said "You said we when you mentioned sleeping in the car." 

 "I have two daughters." 

 "Your landlord will really kick you out if you are late with the rent?" 

 "He said he would and that's all I have to go on." 

 I was probably making a big mistake, but my thinking was that asshole was all set to leave with my woman so what better than him to find out that I was with his. Also, if he came back for her I wouldn't have to look as hard to find him. 

 "Can you cook?" I asked her before she could get away. 

 "Why?" 

 "I'm not that great in the kitchen and thanks to your ex-roomie I don't have a cook and housekeeper any more. It's a four bedroom house so there is plenty of room for you and your daughters. No strings attached. You will be the live in cook and maid and that's all." 

 "You serious?" 

 "You bet." 

 "Why would you do something like that?" 

 "He was all set to walk out of here with my wife. Imagine how he will take it when he hears that the woman that used to be his is now living with me. He won't know that all you are is a live in maid. He will think that we are doing the horizontal boogie and it will make him nuts. And I really can't cook for beans. As I see it it is a win win situation." 

 "Can I trust you?" 

 "Like I'm going to say no you can't? As long as your Honda keeps running you can leave whenever you think you can't trust me." 

 "When can I move in?" 

 "Right now if you want." 

 She gave me a long look and then said, "I'll need help moving my stuff and some of the guys who will help me are members of the Diablos. You sure you want them to know where you live?" 

 "They already know sweetie." 

 "Kari." 

 "Kari?" 

 "Kari is my name, not sweetie." 

 "Okay Kari" I said as I handed her the keys to my truck. "Give me the keys to the Honda. You can get the Diablos to help you load the truck, but we won't need them here. I'll take care of the unloading." 

 She looked at me with a strange expression and said, "The keys are in it. Why are you trusting me with your truck? That's a ten year old car parked at the curb and your truck is almost brand new." 

 "Trust has nothing to do with it Kari. If you aren't back in a reasonable amount of time I'll call it in as stolen and with all the friends I have on the local police force and in the county sheriffs office it won't take them any time at all to find it.' 

 I didn't mention the fact that the truck had Lo-Jack installed. 

 "Besides, I'm trusting that you want your daughters safe and not out on the streets if the landlord follows through on his threat." 

 She gave me another long look and then she turned and left. 

 She was back in three hours and as she got out of the truck I got my next surprise. I don't know why, but based on my best guess of Kari's age I imagined that her daughters would probably be around eight or nine so I was surprised when twin girls who looked every bit of twenty or twenty-one got out of the truck with her. 

 Kari walked up to me and as she handed me the keys to the truck she said, "Close your mouth before flies take up residence." 

 I looked at her. "No way. No way are you old enough to have twenty year old daughters." 

 "They are not twenty. They are an extremely well developed sixteen." 

 "Still, you are old enough to have daughters that age." 

 "Of course I am. I had them when I was fifteen." 

 She called the girls over and introduced them as Beverly and Barbara. They looked at me warily, but took my hand and shook it. 

 "Come on" I said, "Let me show you where you will be staying." 

 I led them into the house and took them on a tour which ended up on the second floor. I pointed out the three spare bedrooms and told them to take their pick. The three of the looked over the rooms, made their choices and then we went down and unloaded the truck. 

 Once they were moved in I told them that I hadn't been expecting company so the pantry was bare and I told Kari to check out the kitchen and the freezer in the basement and make a list of what we needed while I took a shower. I finished my shower, checked out Kari's list to see if there was anything I wanted to add and then we went shopping. I dropped Kari and the girls at King Soopers and told her I had an errand to run and would be back before they got to the check out stands. I told her to buy enough to last us two weeks. 

 "Why two weeks?" 

 "Because I hate shopping." 

 I left them to shop and I drove over to Home Depot and picked up a few things and then drove back to the store. When we got home Kari said she would whip up something for dinner and I went out in the garage and rummaged through my tool box for what I would need. 

 We had a dinner of hamburger steaks and gravy with mashed potatoes and green beans and when everyone was done eating I reached down by my chair and pulled up the Home Depot bag. I took out the three packaged sets of keyed doorknobs and handed one to each of them.  

 

 ****** Rob's Saga Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "I know that all three of you are a little worried about what you might be getting into so I got you these. I'm giving them to you in the package so that you can see that it has not been opened so copies could be made of the keys and I want each of you to be standing there watching as I open the packages, give you the keys and install the doorknobs. I want all three of you to know that you are safe in this house." 

 I saw all three of them look at each other and maybe I just imagined it, but I thought I saw all three of them relax just a little. 

 "Okay then. A couple of rules to follow. Just as your rooms are off limits to me, mine is off limits to you. I have to get up at five to go to work so I'm usually in bed by ten or ten-thirty so try to keep the noise down after I sack out. There is a computer in the den and you are free to use it, but no porn sites. Porn sites are where most of the viruses come from. If there is anything in the kitchen that is especially yours label it otherwise what is in the fridge and pantry is up for grabs. And last of all I don't know if any of you smoke, but if you do the house is a smoke free zone. Outside on the patio or in the garage if the weather is bad, but never in the house. Those are mine. Do you have any?" 

 The two girls looked at each other and then one of them, I'm not sure which since I had not yet learned to tell them apart, asked: 

 "Can we have friends over?" 

 "Of course you can, but you are responsible for them while they are here." 

 "How about TV? Do you have any special shows we need to be aware of so we aren't on it when you want to be?" 

 "There are a couple but I have a set in my bedroom if need be. Oh, one other thing. I despise rap music so if you play it make sure that I don't hear it. Anything else?" 

 The three of them looked at each other and then Kari said, "I guess not, but if we think of something can we bring it up later?" 

 "Of course you can." 

 "Okay then" Kari said, "Come on girls, time to clear the table and clean the kitchen." 

 As they got up I asked myself again if I knew what I was doing and once again the answer was "hell no!" 

 I was sitting in front of the TV in the living room when the girls finished and Kari sent the twins off to do their homework and then she joined me on the couch. 

 "I need to know some things Rob." 

 "Shoot." 

 "Is this just something temporary, just a couple of weeks maybe, while you work on some plan concerning DJ?" 

 "Not at all. I admit that it concerns DJ, but the time limit on your stay is up to you. That of course is subject to change if I end up with another woman in my life, but I don't see that happening until I can legally get rid of the whore I'm married to and my information is that that little chore can take as long as six months. Why? Are you worried that I'm going to kick you out in a week or two?" 

 "I'm not very trusting when it comes to me Rob. They have taken advantage of me and fucked over me most of my life. It hasn't helped any that I've made bad choices. I need to know if it is worth the time and effort to get the girls transferred from the school they are in to the one in this district." 

 "That's strictly up to you. All I can say is that you can stay here until you decide that you don't want to or until I have a new lady in my life and she objects to our arrangement." 

 "Okay. You need to know that I have a job. I wait tables at Patty Ann's CafÃ© on the morning shift. I get off at two so I'll still have plenty of time to take care of my duties here as cook, maid and chief dishwasher. Between me and the girls we will get the job done." 

 "So you could have paid the rent at your old place?" 

 "Not hardly. I make enough to buy groceries and keep the girls in what they need. It is enough to take care of me if I was alone and living in a small one bedroom or studio apartment somewhere, but nowhere near enough to take care of the three of us in a place big enough for the three of us. DJ took care of the rent and utilities and I took care of the food and housekeeping." 

 "So what happened that I got a kiss for kicking him out of your life?" 

 "He kept trying to get me to do drugs with him. He said sex was so much better when on a drug high, but I wasn't buying it. I knew if he got me to try drugs I'd end up hooked and I'd already seen what other Diablos did to the women they got hooked. And then there were the girls. DJ's friends were starting to pay too much attention to them. I'll give DJ credit. He wouldn't stand for any one messing with Barb and Bev, but I began to get the idea that that was because he wanted them for himself. I was already looking for a way out when you did whatever it was that made him run. What did you do?" 

 I told her the story and she looked at me and said, "That's why I'm here isn't it? You expect him to come for me and that is what you are hoping for right?" 

 "It was a thought, but now that I've heard your story I don't think it is likely. I do hope that somehow he hears that you are living here with me. It should make him crazy." 

 "Not that I care any, but why take it out on him because your wife was going to leave you? If she could do it that easily shouldn't you have been thankful that he was getting her out of your life?" 

 "If he had kept his mouth shut and just left I wouldn't have bothered with him at all, but when he started that wimp shit I couldn't let it stand any more than I could turn my back on him coming after me with his buddies." 

 "Would you really cripple him for life if you see him again?" 

 "Absolutely. Threats and promises aren't worth spit unless you follow through on them. Too many people know about what I told the asshole and if the people don't see me follow through the word will get around that I don't mean what I say and I can't be having that." 

 "You told the girls they could have friends over as long as they take responsibility for them. Does that apply to me also?" 

 "Of course, but remember what I said; hold the noise down after I've gone to bed." 

 She blushed. "I don't have anybody waiting in the wings. It is too soon. DJ hasn't been gone long enough for me to start looking for a replacement, but it will happen sooner or later. I'm a healthy girl with healthy appetites. When it happens I'll try not to bring them here, but I did want to clear the decks just in case." 

 "Consider them cleared." 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Surprisingly enough it worked. Kari and the twins took turns cooking and between the three of them they kept the house cleaner than it had ever been. 

 The Girls changed schools and they seemed to be good students. Kari worried about them a lot and she hovered over them like a momma bear over her cubs. She was afraid, and justifiably so, that a pair of sixteen year olds who looked twenty would be hit on a lot by the older boys and it scared her to death because that is what happened to her. 

 She had been an impressionable and extremely well developed fourteen when the eighteen year old seniors at her high school started hitting on her. She got all starry eyed and believed one of the assholes when he told her that he loved her and then she watched as he ran like a thief in the night when he got her pregnant. She kept telling the girls to be careful because she didn't want them to end up like her. 

 The arrangement was in its fourth week when a surprising development took place. Bev came up to me while I was on the computer in my den and her mother and sister were in the kitchen doing the dinner dishes. 

 "Can I ask you something?" 

 "Sure, go ahead." 

 "Are you gay?" 

 "Hell no. Why would you think something like that?" 

 "Why haven't you made a move on my mom? She is as horny as a billy goat and is ready for a man. Does she need to carry a sign saying "Fuck me please" before you pay attention to her?" 

 "Maybe it is because your mom hasn't shown any interest in having a move made on her. Maybe it is because I'm still married and I don't feel right about going after other women before I'm divorced. Maybe it is because I have the hots for someone else." 

 And then, probably because I was a little pissed at her thinking I was gay and a little upset with her attitude, I decided to shock her and I said: 

 "And just maybe it is because I want you and Barb and not your mother." 

 "I expected her to turn purple and run from the room, but she looked me right in the eye and said: 

 "As long as you understand that it won't be without a condom." 

 I'm not sure, but I think I'm the one who turned purple. Bev gave me a little smile and turned and left the room. As I watched her walk I realized that Kari I had good reason to be scared. And so did I. I was painfully aware of the hard on that Bev has just given me. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 From then on the tone of things changed around the house. Bev and Barb (apparently they kept no secrets from each other) started openly flirting with me when Kari wasn't around. I became aware that it was being offered to me if I was ready and willing to step up to the plate. 

 And no, it was not just my imagination. 

 Kari left the house at four-thirty to open Patty Ann's CafÃ© and get things set up for the breakfast crowd. I was up and ready to leave the house between five and five-fifteen and until the night that Bev came into the den the twins were never up until after I was gone. Suddenly, once Kari was gone, the twins were getting up and trotting between their bedrooms and the bathroom naked! It was obvious that I was being deliberately tempted. And tempted I was. God knows I was. But I was also smart enough to know that slipping my cock into a sixteen year old, no matter how desirable she might be, was a one way ticket to a dark and gloomy jail cell. 

 About a week after the girls started running around naked in front of me I took a day off from work to go to the doctor's and get my yearly physical so I was still in the house at seven-thirty. The girls normally left the house for school around ten to eight. I was sitting at the computer checking my email when the girls came into the room. Barb said: 

 "We want to know which of us you want to do first." 

 "I'm not going to do either one of you." 

 "Sure you are. Sooner or later one of us will get you so why fight it?" 

 "There are all kinds of reasons for me to fight it. You are under age and when I got caught I would go to jail and I would get caught because your mom watches you too close. That's one and another is that your mom would kill me if she even thought I may have the idea of doing either of you. Then there is the health issue. No way I would be physically able to handle the both of you so forget it girls; it just ain't gonna happen." 

 "We don't hear you saying you don't want to, just that you are afraid to." 

 "And that is reason enough right there." 

 Bev said, "First off the only reason mom is worried is because she doesn't want us to end up as single moms at our age. That won't ever happen because even though mom doesn't know it we are both on the pill thanks to an older friend of hers who pretended to be our mom when we went to the doctor and if you'll remember I already told you that you would have to use a condom. You won't go to jail because no one but the three of us will ever know. Your health won't be an issue because we will set up a schedule and take turns. You can come up with all the excuses you want, but we have made up our minds so it is going to happen." 

 She looked at her watch and said, "Got to run or we will miss the bus. While you are out today load up on condoms" and then she and Barb left. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 As I sat in the waiting room at the doctor's office I was wondering how you were supposed to handle a pair of sixteen year olds that looked twenty and acted twenty-five. The best that I could come up with is that I was going to have to sit down with Kari and clue her in to what was going on. 

 Was I scared? To death man, to death. 

 I made sure not to go home before I knew Kari would be there. I did not want to be alone with Bev and Barb. I knew what I wasn't going to do, but I didn't know what they might do so I thought it best to avoid them. 

 Dinner was almost ready when I did get home and I went into the bathroom to wash my hands and in the mirror over the sink I saw Barb come in behind me. She opened her blouse to show me that she didn't have a bra on and she cupped her tits in her hands and pointed them at me and said: 

 "Still want to say no?" 

 I ignored her and she laughed and left the room. Barb was sitting opposite me at the dinner table and even though I'm not a lip reader I had no trouble making out the word when she looked at me and silently mouthed the word "chicken." It made me even more determined to have a talk with Kari and I decided to do it when she sent the girls off to do their homework. During the time between dinner ending and the girls being sent off to their rooms I rehearsed what I would say to Kari, but then I started thinking 'what if she doesn't believe me? What if she goes to the girls and they say that it is all bullshit and that I've been hitting on them and now I'm trying to make trouble for them because they kept saying no. What if.....? By the time they were sent off to do their homework I did what Barb had silently accused me of. I chickened out. 

 The next morning I made sure that I was up and out of the house a minute behind Kari. I would handle the problem with the girls by making sure that I was never alone with them. The Waffle House was open all night so I had a place to go to have breakfast and nurse a cup of coffee until it was time to go to work. That got old after two days so I knew I would have to find some other early morning activity to get me out of the house. I was looking through the morning paper and saw an ad announcing the grand opening of a fitness center and it said that the hours of operation would be from five in the morning until nine at night. It was $395 a year and I considered that a fair price if it kept me away from Bev and Barb. 

 That became my new schedule. Up and out of the house at the same time as Kari and waiting at the door of the fitness center when it opened at five and on the other end of the day I made sure that I never went home until I knew that Kari would already be there. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 While all that drama was taking place at home there was even more drama away from home and both had their origins in my confrontation with Audrey and DJ. 

 Kari has kept in touch with one or two of her girl friends who were still running with the Diablos who were lucky enough not to be in jail. They told her that the word was that as soon as the ones I had caused to be locked up got out they would be coming for me. I called Lou and told him that I was interested in that concealed carry permit he had mentioned and he put me in touch with the people I had to talk with. I already had a Beretta 92F and after a twelve hour course I had a permit to carry. 

 Next I tried to visit a couple of the Diablos who were in prison, but found out that the only way you could get on the approved visitor's list was if the inmate requested that you be put on it. I finally got one who was curious enough about why I wanted to visit to put me on his list. I went to see him on a Saturday. He sat on the other side of the glass partition and I could tell from the smirkish smile on his face that he knew what was planned for me so I cut right to the chase. 

 "The reason I wanted to see you was to give you the chance to save your life." 

 The smirk disappeared and was replaced by a 'what the fuck you talking about' look. 

 "Here's the deal. I've heard about what you say you are going to do to me when you get out and here is what I am going to do about it." I took my carry permit out of my shirt pocket and held it up to the partition so he could read it. 

 "They wouldn't let me bring the Beretta in here, but I don't go anywhere else without it. The way it is going to be is that if I see any one of you once you get out I will kill you. If we run into each other walking down an aisle at Safeway I will take out my gun and kill you. If I am in a gas station putting gas in my car and you pull in to get gas for your bike and I see you I will kill you. If I'm driving down the street and I see you coming up from behind in the next lane I will roll my window down and kill you when you get close enough. Get the message? If I see you anywhere at all I'm going to remember that you said you were going to get me when you got out and I will kill you before you get the chance. 

 "All my friends in the sheriff's office and on the local police force know about your threat and they have already said to do what I have to do and they will make sure that it goes down as a justifiable homicide. So get your head around it. I will kill you if I see you. Tell all your buddies. If I see any of you you will die. I will not wait for you to make a move and then defend myself. I see you and I will kill you. Have a nice day." 

 I got up and walked out of the visiting room. It was bullshit about the cops giving me a pass, but he didn't know that. He saw all the cops I had waiting when he and his crew showed up at my place and he knew that DJ had been left in my hands when the rest of them were hauled away so I was betting that he believed me. 

 The other thing going on was that Audrey was fighting the divorce. All of a sudden I was the love of her life, she couldn't live without me and everything that had happened was all just a huge misunderstanding. We could put things back together if I would just sit down with her and talk things out. 

 "Not a chance in hell" I told her through my attorney. She countered by having her attorney petition the court to order counseling and the judge did it. It was one of those open ended things where it would go on and on until the councilor decided that there was no hope of reconciliation and since he was paid by the session and not a flat fee he could drag it out forever. 

 I let him know up front in the very first session that there was not the slightest chance that I would ever take the bitch back. The first session was 'what were the major problems between us?' I told my side and Audrey kept butting in and telling me that I was wrong, that I just didn't understand the situation and if I would only let her explain.....! I stood up and started to leave and the councilor asked me where I was going. I told him there was no sense in my staying there and trying to tell my side if he wasn't going to tell her to shut the fuck up and stop interrupting me. He told Audrey to keep quiet and that she would get her turn when I was finished. I sat down, finished my say with: 

 "Counseling is not going to do any good in this case. It will only work where both parties want to see if they can save the marriage, but it won't work here because no way am I staying with a lying, cheating, thieving whore." 

 Then it was her turn. She had never cheated on me and she wasn't really leaving me. It was just going to be a trial separation to give her some time and space to work on some issues she had with our marriage. She wasn't running off with DJ; he was just a friend she had there with her in case I tried to stop her from leaving. And she didn't mean to take all of the money out of our account. She only meant to take half, but she was nervous, sweating the coming confrontation with me and here mind was elsewhere when the teller at the bank told her our balance and she automatically wrote it down on the withdrawal slip. She realized the mistake on her way home and she intended to give me half the money before she left, but I never gave her the chance The bottom line was that she loved me, really, really loved me and it was all just a huge mistake and that we could work things out. 

 The councilor said that was enough for that session. He told us each to make a list of the issues we each saw in the marriage and bring it to the next session to discuss. I wanted to tell him there wouldn't be anymore sessions, but I couldn't. My lawyer ha already told me that the divorce was stalled until the court had the report from the marriage councilor saying that no hope of a reconciliation existed and that no councilor was going to say that without at least four sessions.  

 

 ****** Rob's Saga Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© The second session was more bullshit from Audrey as she listed the issues she had while I listened and shook my head. I dropped my dirty clothes on the floor. I left the toilet seat up. I never called when I was going to be a little late in coming home. I got up Saturday morning and cut the grass even though I knew she liked to sleep in on the weekends and the mower motor would wake her up. She was willing to watch football with me, but I would never watch Oprah with her and on and on and on. She made herself look like an absolute doofus. 

 He asked for my list and I told him that I didn't have one. I told him I was perfectly happy with my marriage right up to the day that she and DJ ambushed me in our living room. Actually, I didn't say it quite that way. What I said was: 

 "Until the whore cheated on me and tried to steal my money." 

 "I explained all that honey." 

 "And I don't believe a word of it." 

 Then the councilor said that the next session would be a one on one with Audrey followed by a one on one with me after which he would decide whether or not we needed to go any farther. After Audrey had gone I asked him what good it would do to have the one on ones when he had to already know that I wouldn't get back together with Audrey at the point of a gun. 

 "I have to do it because the judge ordered it. If it were Judge Harriman or Judge Spiegel I could go back after one session and tell them there was no hope and say that further sessions would be a waste of time. Your judge and three or four others insist on a minimum of four sessions. Be thankful your judge isn't Whitman. He has been known to specify eight or ten sessions. And before you ask, no. I won't let you not show and say that you did. If your wife or her attorney somehow found out I would be toast. The best I can do for you is to schedule your one on one for a Monday night and we can watch Monday Night Football on the TV in my office. And that is just what we did. 

 On my way home from watching the game it suddenly occurred to me that I was being stupid. Audrey didn't want a divorce so by God I wouldn't give her one. We were in a no fault state so she would end up with half of our assets. She couldn't touch the house because it had been left to me by my parents and I had never added her name to the title or the mortgage, but she would get half of the cash, household furnishings, one of the vehicles and part of my pension and 401k when I retired and probably some alimony since I made more than she did at her part time morning job. No divorce, no divorce settlement. Audrey was thinking no divorce meant she would move back in, but that would be a cold day in hell. 

 I called Audrey as soon as I got home and told her that after having my session with Henry I decided to drop the divorce. 

 "When can I come home?" 

 "When hell freezes over. I'm dropping the divorce because I'm not going to waste any more of my time fighting with you over it, but I still don't want anything to do with your lying, cheating ass" and I hung up on her. That wouldn't be the end of it and I knew it, but it would take her a while to figure out what to do next and -- more importantly -- come up with the money to do anything about it. The next morning I called my attorney and told him to do what needed to be done to stop the divorce proceedings. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Back on the home front I was still doing everything I could to avoid being alone with Barb and Bev. They were tempting as hell and I had been without long enough that I occasionally had some impure thoughts where they were concerned, but thank God my big head was still in charge. 

 To be continued... 

 * 

 My ending to this story is already written and I will post it thirty days after the first part is posted. I believe that I have given plenty to work with and it will be interesting to see what others can come up with. 

 JPB October 19, 2009  

 

 ****** Rob's Saga Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© And then the one thing I never expected happened. I woke up in the middle of the night with my dick being sucked. My first thought was that Bev or Barb had snuck into my room and were just going to take what I would not give on my own. I tensed and was gathering myself to rise up and push whichever twin it was off of me when a voice said: 

 "Relax baby; we both need this." 

 The voice was Kari's and she swung over me, took my cock in her hand, lined it up and pushed down on it. It had been a while for me and I did not last as long as I would have liked to, but it didn't bother Kari. 

 "It has been a while for me too baby, but don't worry because we aren't done yet." 

 She went back to work on my cock and I responded to her ministrations. The second time was a lot longer and more satisfying and when it was over Kari said: 

 "I want to stay and cuddle. I want my girls to see me leave your room in the morning." 

 I opened my arms and she snuggled in. 

 I woke up when she got out of bed. "It's early" she said, "You have another hour or so until your alarm goes off. I just heard one of the girls go into the bathroom so I'm going to leave your room as she comes out into the hallway. I want her to see me." 

 She bent over and kissed me and said, "Until tonight baby." She moved over to the door, hesitated until she heard the bathroom door open and then she stepped out of my room into the hall. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 I got a call at work from Kari asking me to meet her at Miller's Bar when I got off work. When I got there she was sitting at a table and two guys were standing there talking to her when I came in. She saw me and waved me over and when I got there she stood up and kissed me and then sat down. 

 "Guys, this is my boyfriend Rob. Rob, this is Stan and Jerry." 

 The guys shook my hand, said "Nice meeting you," and then told Kari that they would see her around and walked away. She smiled and said: 

 "That worked out well." 

 "What worked out well?" 

 "Killing two birds with one stone. One, I needed to talk with you away from the house and two, those two will spread the word about my boyfriend and that will shut down some of the assholes who keep bothering me." 

 "I'm your new boyfriend?" 

 "You are if you want to be." 

 "What do you need me to talk about away from the house?" 

 "Last night. I need to explain it." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because I don't know if you are okay with it and if you aren't I need to explain why so you don't throw us out on our butts." 

 "Did I behave like I was unhappy about it?" 

 "No, but how you feel when Mr. Happy is busy is not an indication of how things are when he is resting." 

 "So what is to explain?" 

 "I was super horny and I needed to get laid. I've been trying to find someone who would turn me on since I've moved in with you, but I haven't had much luck. A lot of horn dogs like Stan and Jerry, but no one I could really get interested in except you, but I stayed away from you because you didn't seem all that interested in me other than something that could piss off DJ." 

 "What changed your mind?" 

 "Barb and Bev." 

 "How did they change your mind?" 

 "I was in the laundry room folding clothes and they thought that I was up in my room so they were talking unaware that I could hear them. I heard all about their plans to get you to do them and I knew that the only way I could stop it was to get to you first and then let them find out about it so they would leave you alone." 

 "You didn't have to worry. They have been wagging their butts at me for two weeks now and I have avoided them. Believe me, I wouldn't have touched them." 

 "Oh yes you would have. What I did last night was what they had planned on doing. They were going to flip a coin to see which one of them was going to be the one to sneak in and wake you with a blow job. If one of them had gotten you up and hard there is no doubt in my mind that you would not have stopped." 

 "I've been expecting them to pull something and I have a great sense of self preservation. My fear of going to jail over having sex with a minor would have me putting a stop to it as soon as I realized what was going on. You saw it yourself. You felt me getting ready to push you away and that is why you told me to relax. It is only because I recognized your voice that you didn't end up on your butt on the floor." 

 "But you didn't push me away and I'm glad. I enjoyed myself and I'd like to do it again. In fact I'd like to do it on a steady basis. How do you feel about that?" 

 "As I recall you kissed me and said "Until tonight" when you left my room and I don't believe I said "No way! Not gonna do it." 

 She smiled at me and said, "It has been a while for me. Early night tonight?" 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Outside of the nasty looks the twins gave me and a bi-weekly phone call from Audrey saying that she knew we could work things out if I would just talk to her the next three months passed by uneventfully. Work was going well, Kari and I were having sex three and four times a week, the twins were doing well in school and had gotten involved in girls volleyball and field hockey. 

 And then Audrey reared up and threw shit into the game. 

 She had saved up enough money to get an attorney and she had filed for a legal separation. The judge -- a different one -- ordered counseling and we started all over again. It was a different Audrey at the first of the mandated sessions. It was a different marriage councilor and so it was all new to him. 

 I told my side the same as I had done in the first go round and Audrey didn't try to interrupt me. When it was her turn she calmly said: 

 "I filed for a separation rather than a divorce because I don't want a divorce and my attorney said a separation would be the best way to get court ordered counseling and I believe that if I can just sit down with Rob and explain things we can work things out. 

 "First, I need to clear a couple of things up. Rob accused me of being a cheating whore and that is not true. I have never cheated on him and I'm perfectly willing to take a lie detector test on that. DJ was there with me that day to help me if you got violent and before you explode on me for saying that I will admit that never in our marriage did you ever raise a hand to me, but then I had never told you that I was walking out on you either. I had no way of knowing how you would react and that is why DJ was there. The other thing is that I was called a thief and I deny that. The way I explained it in previous sessions is just the way it happened. I would have given half of it back, but I never got the chance and I'll take a lie detector test on that also. 

 "I made some errors in judgment. I should have handled things differently and I know that now. I should have sat down and explained why I wanted a trial separation and then discussed it with you, but as we all know, hindsight is twenty twenty." 

 Then Barry, the councilor, said "Now that you have brought it up suppose you tell us just why you wanted that trial separation." 

 "I wanted some excitement in my life. Marriage to Rob was dull and boring. We never went anywhere or did anything. I love Rob and our sex life was good, but I wanted a little more than that. I talked with my girlfriend Anna two or three times a week and she was always telling me about the fun things she was doing and after a while I started wanting to do some fun things too. One of the things I've always wanted to do was try pot, but Rob has always been a rabid anti-drug person. I wanted to drink and dance all night long, but while Rob drinks he doesn't dance and so he never took me anywhere where I could dance with someone else if they asked me. Of course, knowing Rob, I know he would never let me dance with anyone else even if he took me to a place where it could happen. 

 "One afternoon Anna talked me into going out and spending an afternoon with her. We went to a bar on the other side of town and she introduced me to some of her friends. We drank and danced to the music on the juke box and a couple of guys asked us if we wanted to go for a ride. It was my first time on a motorcycle and I loved it. I started spending one or two afternoons a week with Anna and her friends. 

 "One day DJ was there and he asked me if I'd like to take a ride with him and I said yes. We rode for almost an hour and then he pulled in and parked at a picnic area and he asked me if I would like to share a joint with him. It was something that I had always wanted to try and I said yes. I liked it. I liked the feeling that it gave me. When the joint was gone we rode back to the bar. After that DJ always seemed to be there whenever I went with Anna and he always asked me if I wanted to go for a ride. 

 "Most of the time there were a half dozen bikes on the run and we always ended up somewhere where we did a little smoke. I always made sure that I was home in time to have dinner ready for Rob when he got home from work. One day DJ made a pass at me and I shut him down. I told him that I was married and that I loved my husband. He didn't push it, just shrugged, but he was always the one offering the rides and he was always the one who was sharing his pot with me. 

 "I was having a ball, but I wanted more. I got the dumb idea of telling Rob I was going to leave him for a while to try and find myself. I discussed it with Anna and she suggested that I have someone with me to keep Rob from going off on me. I asked DJ if he would do it and he said that he would. Then he asked me if I really expected trouble from Rob and I made the mistake of saying probably not, that Rob was usually a pussycat. So he said that what I was telling him is that Rob was a wimp and to my everlasting shame I didn't say no to that. I just shrugged my shoulders and said that Rob probably was. The only reason I did that was so that DJ wouldn't change his mind about going with me. If he thought Rob would be no trouble he wouldn't back out. 

 "Anyway, it all went to hell when Rob came home and I told him I was leaving. He surprised me by just saying "Have a nice life" and that is when DJ went all stupid on us and here we are." 

 She turned to me and said, "I love you Rob and I don't want a divorce." 

 I just shrugged and said "Okay Audrey, I've listened to what you have said. Some of it or maybe even all of it may be true, but it changes nothing as far as I'm concerned. The day you told me you were leaving me for whatever the reason is the day our marriage died. I wrote you off then and I see no reason to change my mind. By your own words here I wasn't good enough for you then. I wasn't exciting enough for you then. Well I have news for you Audrey; I'm still the same un-exciting guy that I was then and I'm never going to change. Taking you back would be the dumbest thing I could do. I could never trust that some day you wouldn't go off again to find your so called excitement." 

 "You say that you that you never cheated on me with DJ or any of the others you had your excitement with. It could possibly be true, but I will never believe it. Assholes like DJ and the guys he ran with don't waste time on broads that don't put out. So there it is. You can force counseling all you want and you can fight any divorce I pursue, but you and I are done. There is no -- I repeat, no -- chance that you and I will ever get back together." 

 Barry looked from me to Audrey and then said, "Counseling only works when both parties want to work at saving a marriage. I can see that isn't the case here. I will file my report with the court stating that I see no chance of reconciliation in this case. Audrey cried out: 

 "Damn it Rob, I love you. You have to give me a chance." 

 "I gave you six years Audrey and it wasn't enough." 

 I got up, shook Barry's hand and thanked him for his time and then walked out of his office. As I headed home I made up my mind that I was not going to restart the divorce. Why waste the money just so I could give money and other assets to Audrey. Any divorce would be because she went for it. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x- 

 The next six months went by quickly. Kari had moved into my bedroom much to the dismay of Bev and Barb who seemed to still have designs on me. By then I was treating them like daughters. They had both taken Driver's Ed in school and had their temporary permits and I spent a lot of time out on the road with them. When we were away from Kari they flirted shamelessly with me, but I still wasn't having any of it. Finally I sat them both down and told them flat out that they were wasting their time. 

 "You are both underage and I will not risk going to jail so give it a rest." 

 "So what I'm hearing" Bev said, "Is that if we were eighteen it would be a done deal?" 

 I threw up m hands in exasperation and walked away from them. 

 They got all As and Bs on their report cards and they were heavily involved in girls sports and except for their obsession with trying to get in my bed they were great kids. 

 They took their drive tests and they both passed and got their permanent licenses and I sat down at the dinner table with them a week before their seventeenth birthday and told them that their mother and I had worked out a deal. I was going to give their mother my ex's car which was only two years old in exchange for her ten year old car and then I was going to give them their mother's car as a birthday present. There were squeals of delight and they jumped up, ran around the table and kissed and hugged me. 

 That night as Kari and I were relaxing in each other's arms after making love she said: 

 "Thank you lover." 

 "For what?" 

 "For being the man you are. You are the closest thing to a father that the girls have ever had." 

 "You're kidding me?" 

 "No I'm not. The men I've hooked up with have tolerated them, but only because they wanted me. And there were some like DJ who tried to hide it from me, but saw them as fresh meat. I know that doesn't say much for me, but you can't always tell what kind a man is when you first start out with him. I wish I'd met you fifteen years ago." 

 "No you don't. Fifteen years ago I was a horn dog running around trying to stick my dick into anything female." 

 "What changed you?" 

 "I grew up." 

 "Oh well, better late than never" she said as she fondled my cock. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 It seemed that my life was destined to be full of surprised. The twins had several friends over on their birthday. We had cake and ice cream and then I handed them each a twenty and handed Bev -- she was the oldest by three minutes - the keys to Kari's old car and told them to make sure that they were home by eleven. After they and their friends were gone Kari and I curled up on the couch and she said: 

 "I talked with your wife today." 

 "You what?" 

 "I was in Safeway picking up the cake and ice cream and she walked up to me and said hi. I didn't know Audrey was your wife." 

 "Sure you did. There isn't a week goes by that she doesn't get mentioned." 

 "Yes, but never by name. It was always "That bitch I was married to" or "My whore of an ex." You never mentioned her by name." 

 "Why does it matter?" 

 "It doesn't I guess; it's just that I knew her when she was hanging around the Diablos with her friend Anna." 

 "Then you know what a whore she was." 

 "Actually I don't. The whole time she was around us all she did was some drinking, dancing and pot smoking. She liked going on rides, but she never did anything else. She might have wanted to, but she never did." 

 "So what did she want?" 

 "She heard that I was staying with you and wanted to know why I was trying to steal her man." 

 "Her man? That's a laugh." 

 "She thinks she can get you back if only I will get out of the way." 

 "Not a chance in hell of that." 

 "I told her I was not in her way, that I was just a boarder and that I got room and board for being the maid and cook and I told her that the only reason you let me move in was so you could rub DJ's nose in it." 

 "And she bought that? That doesn't sound like Audrey." 

 "I told her I tried to get you in bed, but you pushed me away and said it wouldn't be right and that you couldn't do anything like that until you were divorced. She really does plan on trying to get you back." 

 "You should have told her we were bed buddies and maybe then she would have gotten the message that I'm done with her." 

 "I might have if it had been anyone else, but I know she never cheated on you at least not with our group so I didn't think it would be fair. I liked her. I think she got stupid there for a little bit and now she's trying to get back what she knows she should have never given up." 

 All I could do when I heard that was shrug. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 I started getting weekly phone calls from Audrey. The first one set the tone for all that followed. 

 "Kari tells me that you don't make love because you aren't divorced yet. I'm never going to give you a divorce so the question is how long can you go without sex? Knowing you I'm surprised that it has been this long. You don't have to go without baby; I'm here for you. Any time at all, just call me." 

 "Why don't you just go away Audrey?" 

 "I can't baby; I love you. I know I fucked up and I'm sorry, but I do love you and I'm going to get you back. It may take some time, but I'm going to get you back." 

 What the hell was with that woman I thought as I hung up the phone. She couldn't wait to bail out on me and now she's all hot to come back. Why? She was out there. She was free to do whatever she wanted. She was a good looking and sexy looking woman and I knew she has to have plenty of guys sniffing around. So there she was. Man bait, free to smoke pot, drink, dance and have all that excitement that she was leaving me to experience so why the fuck was she bugging me to take her back? To me it made no sense at all. 

 On the home front even though Kari has staked her claim the twins still took shots at me whenever Kari wasn't around. They thought nothing of walking naked in front of me and they would come into the bathroom and try to catch me with my dick out and in my hand as I was taking a whiz. Once Bev came in and asked me if she could hold it and aim it for me. They did it even though I had a lock on the door. The knob was one of those you could open from the outside with a dime or even a long fingernail. I heard it was designed that way so little kids couldn't get accidently lock themselves in the bathroom. I finally had to replace it with a keyed lock.

 That was my life for the next six months. Work, make love to Kari three or four times a week, cut grass, do household chores, get a phone call from Audrey every two weeks or so and fight off the attentions of the twins. They almost got me once and it was a close call. 

 Kari had gone somewhere to do something and I was sitting in the easy chair watching something on the TV and I nodded off. Suddenly I felt something on my chest and I woke up and saw Barb wrapping clothesline around me and the chair. Bev was doing the same thing to my legs and the chair legs. When they were done they stepped back to admire their handiwork and then Bev said: 

 "Who gets him first?" 

 They did 'rock, paper, scissors' and Barb won. She was just pulling at my zipper when they heard the garage door start to open. 

 "Shit! Moms home." 

 They hurriedly unwrapped me and then ran off to their rooms before Kari got into the house. I had thought that with me and Kari involved I would be okay, but apparently I wasn't. I resolved never to let myself be alone with them again. 

 Audrey's phone calls were sounding a little more desperate. "Please baby, you have to let me come home. I don't know how much longer I can hold out." 

 "What do you mean "hold out?" 

 "I'm a healthy girl Rob and I haven't had sex since the last time with you." 

 "So go get yourself laid."

 "Why didn't you think of that way back when you decided to bail out on me?" 

 "I wasn't thinking Rob. I was just thinking of the fun I could have. I didn't wake up until I found out what DJ had planned for me. I'm sorry Rob. I messed up big time, but I will make it up to you. Please baby, please let me come home." 

 "Why Audrey? Just so I can spend my time wondering when you would get bored with me and go partying with Anna again?" 

 "I don't even talk to Anna anymore. She knew what was likely to happen to me and she never warned me. She was a fucking Judas goat." 

 "I'm sorry Audrey, but I just can't see it happening. Bye." 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Kari got a call from one of her friends who told her that two of the Diablos who had gone to jail and who had gotten a year each were out on early release and I started carrying my Beretta.. About three weeks after getting the call Kari and I were at the mall and I saw one of them. He saw me at the same time and he saw me open my coat and reach for the Beretta in the shoulder holster. He turned and ran in the other direction so I guess he got the message that I had passed that day in the prison visiting room, 

 It was a week after that that disaster struck. 

 I've gone back over it in my head a dozen times and the only way I can see that it could have been prevented would have been if I had just ignored DJ when he called me a wimp and turned and left the room to let him and Audrey leave. 

 It was a Monday night and I was in the upstairs bathroom changing a burned out light bulb when I saw three guys come over the back fence. As they moved to the house I noticed that one of them had a bad limp. I hurried to my bedroom and got the Beretta and moved quietly down the stairs. The stairs ended on a landing that led into the living room on the right and the dining room on the left. Kari and the twins were on the couch where they had been watching TV. The three men were facing them and apparently had not heard me coming down the stairs. As I reached the bottom of the stairs I heard DJ saying: 

 "......three of you whores making money for me, but first I'm going to settle up with the fuck face who lives here. Where is he?" 

 "Right behind you sperm breath." 

 He spun around and I saw that he has a gun in his hand. I already had mine up and I put three rounds in the center of his chest. As they drove him backwards he threw his arms out wide and his gun went off. The two men with him put their arms up and cried, "Don't shoot, don't shoot." I heard Bev and Barb screaming. It took a second or two to register that they were screaming "mommy, mommy." I took a quick look and I saw Kari slumped on the couch with blood running down the front of her. I hollered "call 911" but both girls were hysterical. I kept the gun on the two men and hurried over and slapped Bev and when she shook it off I told her to call 911. 

 I walked over to DJ and kicked his gun away. He looked up at me and gasped: 

 "I'm hurt bad. Call an ambulance man; for God's sake get me some help." 

 I leaned down and whispered in his ear, "I told you if I ever saw you again I'd kill you. No ambulance for you cocksucker. Lay there and die." 

 I told the two guys to le down on the floor on their backs and spread their arms and legs like they were making Angels in the snow. 

 "If you move I will kill you. Raise your head, twitch, any movement at all and I will shoot you dead. I swear to God I will. I'm sorely tempted to do it anyway." 

 "Don't man, please don't. We was only supposed to help him get his bitches back. Wasn't supposed to be no shootin. We don't want no part of this shit man." 

 While holding the gun on them I got Kari on her back and ripped open her blouse. I grabbed a throw pillow and put it over the bullet hole in her chest and pushed down to try and stop the bleeding. Her eyes fluttered open and she managed to lift her arm and her hand grabbed my wrist. 

 "My girls" she said weakly, "Take care of my girls. Promise me Rob; take care of my babies." 

 "I promise." 

 Her grip weakened and then with a little cry she was gone. Bev and Barb were crying and Barb looked at me and asked, "Momma?" 

 All I could do was shake my head no and that set off more wailing. 

 After all of the flashing red and blue lights were gone and the girls and I were alone I tried to calm them down, but how do you do that to two girls who have just seen their mother shot and then die in front of them? All I could do was put my arms around them and hug them as they cried into my shoulders. After a while I led them to my bedroom and the three of got on the king size bed and with Barb on my right and Bev on my left and one arm around each of them I held them while they cried themselves to sleep. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 The next three days were busy with interviews with detectives and assistant district attorneys and making arrangements for Kari's funeral. There were only a dozen or so in attendance and one of them, a hard looking redhead, came up to me and introduced herself as Matty, shook my hand and told me that she was sorry for my loss. 

 "You were good for her. She was really happy for the first time in the eight years that I knew her. She was hoping to marry you if you ever divorced Audrey. It was the first time I ever heard her talk about marriage." 

 "You know Audrey?" 

 "She ran with us for a while until we clued her in on what DJ had planned for her." 

 "Why did you clue her in?" 

 "It was obvious to the rest of us that she didn't belong there. She was getting a taste of wild for the first time in her life and it was turning her head. She wouldn't have lasted a week on the street and we knew it so we told her what she was getting herself into in time for her to get out." 

 "I heard she was pulling trains with the guys in your club." 

 "I don't know who told you that shit, but she never gave it up for any of the guys even though nearly all of them tried. Not even DJ although he did brag about what he was going to do with her when he got her broke in. Anyway, I kept Kari up to date on what the Diablos were planning and if you want to give me your number I'll call you if anything about you comes up." 

 I gave her my number and she left. It was a sad day for the twins and they were not yet cried out so I had my hands full trying to comfort them. Since that first night we had all been sleeping in my bed, but I was going to have to put and end to that soon. I didn't expect anything to happen until we got a ways away from their mother's death, but given their track record in the past it was likely that one day in the future I was going to be a target again. 

 At breakfast the day after Kari's funeral both girls were sitting at the table with their eyes downcast. I assumed that they were grieving so I didn't say anything. About halfway through breakfast Bev set her fork down and said: 

 "When do we have to leave?" 

 "Leave? Why are you leaving?" 

 "Mom's gone. None of her other boyfriends wanted us around even when she was there and now she's gone." 

 "Yes she is, but I'm not. The last thing your mom said to me was "promise me that you will take care of my girls" and I promised her that I would. You are my girls now and you aren't leaving unless you want to." 

 "You mean it?" Barb cried, "We can stay?" 

 "As long as you want." 

 They both jumped up and came over and hugged me and there was more crying only that time it wasn't caused by sadness. 

 The next two nights they slept with me and one morning I woke up with Barb's leg thrown over mine and her left hand on my thigh about three inches away from home plate. I started getting stiff and I knew that it was time to send them back to their own rooms. It was also time to step back and look at what I had promised Kari and where it was going to lead. There were no two ways about it. I was going to need protection from the twins and to brutally honest with myself they were getting very close to needing protection from me. 

 But what to do? 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Almost as I had the thought a possibility occurred. The fact that I even remotely considered it shows how desperate I was. Audrey called. 

 "Are you ready yet?" 

 "Am I ready for what?" 

 "Are you ready to let me back into your life?" 

 "Why do you keep bothering me Audrey?" 

 "Because I love you Rob. I've told you and told you that and why you won't believe me I'll never understand." 

 "It should be very easy for you to understand Audrey. Just think back to that day in the living room when you stood up and said, "God. Now we can get this over with." Remember that Audrey? Remember your next words? I believe they were "I'm leaving you." Remember that?" 

 "I screwed up Rob. I admitted that I screwed up. I also said that I would take a lie detector test on the cheating and the money. Give me a chance Rob. Let me prove to you that I love you and want to be with you." 

 "A chance? Just how bad do you want that chance?" 

 "I'll do anything Rob, anything at all." 

 "I doubt that Audrey, but I guess we will just have to see." 

 "You'll do it? You'll give me a chance?" 

 "We need to talk Audrey and not on the phone. Meet me at Augie's tomorrow night at six and we will talk." 

 Audrey was there waiting for me in one of the rear booths when I got to Augie's Bar and Grille. One look at her and I remembered why I had gone after her in the first place. She really was a very sexy looking and very good looking woman. I sat down across from her and the waitress was there almost immediately and I ordered drinks. When she had taken our order and gone I went right to it. 

 "You hurt me Audrey. What you did cut me to the quick. What your reason was for doing it doesn't mean shit to me. What matters to me is what you did to me. You were only thinking of yourself and you didn't give a rat's ass what it would do to me. You just didn't care and I can't forget that. I don't trust you Audrey and that is the reason that I have never considered taking you back. I don't trust you not to break it off in me again. You can promise me all of your love and devotion for the rest of your life, but you already did that once, remember? When I slid that ring onto your finger? Promise all you want Audrey, but I will always be watching and waiting for you to screw me again. 

 "The problem is that I am between a rock and a hard place. Letting you back into my life just might be the lesser of two evils. The fact that I'm even considering it shows just how bad things are." 

 I went on to explain the situation with Kari's daughters. 

 "I promised her that I would take care of them and I will, but I need to protect myself from them. The only way to do that is to have a woman in my life and bedroom. Given how bold the twins have been in the past I don't think I have the luxury of taking the time to date and woo a woman. I need something to happen right now." 

 "Count me in Rob." 

 "You haven't heard the whole deal yet Audrey. You can move back into the house and back into my bedroom, but all we will be doing is putting on a show for the girls. I doubt that there will be any sex for a while if ever. I don't know if I can bring myself to touch you." 

 "It will happen Rob. I love you and I know that deep inside you still care for me. I'll bring it out Rob." 

 "There is more for you to consider. Are you ready to try and handle two grown girls? Two girls who are going to resent you for taking what they hoped would be theirs? Two girls who are not going to be happy with an adult female filling their recently departed mother's slot in the house?" 

 "I can handle it Rob. I can and will do anything I have to do to get you back." 

 "You have a long hard road ahead of you Audrey and the one thing that you need to know going in is that if you and the girls can't get along you will be the one leaving, not them. I promised Kari I would take care of them and I will. I don't know that I will ever get to the point where I trust you again, but if you want the shot I'll give it to you." 

 "I want it Rob and I promise you that you will never be sorry." 

 "I guess we will find out. When do you want to move back in?" 

 "Now. I'll start moving my things as soon as we leave here." 

 "No Audrey. I have to talk with Bev and Barb first. Nothing they will say will change anything, but I do owe them advanced notice. You can move back in tomorrow." 

 Tears were running down her cheeks as she said, "Thank you Rob, thank you." 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Driving home I wondered if it would work. God knew that I still had strong feelings for Audrey. There was a fine line between love and hate and on any given day I could be found on one side of that line or the other. Before Kari moved into my bedroom I'd wake up missing Audrey and wishing that she was there in the bed beside me and then I would remember just why she wasn't there and I'd cross over to the other side of the line. Even after Kari became my full time bed buddy I'd think of Audrey during the day at work and wonder where she was and what she was doing and then I'd remember what she'd done and be back on the bad side of the line. 

 Would it work? I had no idea, but I hoped that it would, at least long enough for the girls to find steady boyfriends. They dated a lot, but neither one of them had come up with a special guy. 

 When I walked into the house I heard Bev on the phone. "I don't know? I'll have to ask my dad." That stopped me dead in my tracks. It was the first time I had heard either of them refer to me as "dad" and it suddenly occurred to me just how much trust Kari had in me when she made me promise to take care of her girls. It was a pretty humbling experience. 

 "I'm home" I called out as I closed the door behind me. Dinner was ready and as we sat down to eat I wondered if I would still be called dad after I had talked with them. I knew that I couldn't put it off so as soon as we finished dinner I said: 

 "We need to talk." 

 "About what?" asked Barb. 

 "About what is going to happen around here. As you both know your mother and I had an arrangement. What you don't know" I lied "is that the arrangement was about to change. Your mother was in the process of moving back into her room when the bad shit happened." 

 "Why?" asked Bev, "Why would she do that? She was happy with things the way they were." 

 I kept the lie going. "Your mother knew that what we had was never going to be long term. She knew that I was still in love with my wife. She never understood why especially knowing what Audrey had done to me, but she did know that I was still in love with Audrey. Audrey and I have been talking and trying to work things out and we decided to get back together and see if we could make things work. Your mother was moving so Audrey could move back in. Because of what happened we put off Audrey's move to let things settle down a bit around here. I wanted to give you a little advance notice and that is why I brought it up tonight. Audrey will be moving back in tomorrow." 

 "How could you" Bev cried, "Didn't mom mean anything to you at all?" 

 "Your mother meant a great deal to me honey, but your mother didn't love me and I didn't love her. It is like I said, we had an arrangement. You never knew, at least I don't think you did, but that arrangement came about because of you." 

 I told them about their mother overhearing their plans for me and how she decided that the only way to prevent it from happening was to get to me first. "So it started out as just a way to keep you two away from me. Over time we developed feelings for each other, but those feelings were never more than a strong affection for each other. We were very good friends, friends with benefits as it were, but still just friends." 

 "What about us" Barb wanted to know. 

 "Nothing changes as far as you two are concerned. Your mother gave you to me and I promised her that I would take care of you. You are mine now. Audrey is not coming here to be a replacement mother for you. I am hoping that you will be able to get along and in time become friends, but if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen. But you need to know that this is your home and that is not going to change. You are my girls now and that is the bottom line." 

 Both girls looked at me and then Barb showed that she me that she had a little more savvy than I had given her credit for. 

 "Is this you getting together with your wife to try and put things back together or is this just another arrangement being put in place to keep Bev and me out of your bedroom. Be honest with us here daddy. If this is just a way to hold us at bay and you really don't want to do it say so. I will promise to behave and leave you be rather than see you do something that you really don't want to do." 

 "Me too daddy" Bev said, "Please don't do it if you really don't want to." 

 Well, there it was. My way out. I knew that if the twins promised me something that they would follow through on it. The problem was the timing. If I would have had the conversation with them the night before -- after I'd set the time to meet Audrey, but before meeting her -- things might have gone differently because I would have had their promise, but I didn't have the talk and so I didn't have the promise when Audrey and I had our sit down. What I did have was that Kari and her friend Matty had told me that Audrey had never engaged in sex when she spent her time running around with Anna and the Diablos and Audrey had volunteered to take a lie detector test on the subject. I pretty much accepted that she hadn't cheated on me before leaving me. After? Who knows? 

 Audrey was a healthy woman and with a healthy woman's sexual appetite. Since I wouldn't let her come back I really couldn't blame her if she found someone to scratch her itch especially since I was busy letting Kari scratch mine. The fact was that I was ready to let Audrey come home. I was ready to try and put things back together. Would it help where Bev and Barb were concerned? Probably, but I did have to admit to myself that I did want to try it again with Audrey. 

 I looked from Bev to Barb and asked, "When did you start calling me daddy?" 

 "Months and months ago" Bev said. "We always referred to you as dad when we talked to mom and our friends. We never said it to you because we didn't know if you would like it." 

 "Thank you both. I'm honored that you think so well of me. Now to answer your question. I am taking Audrey back because I want to see if we can put our marriage back together. In fact it was your mom that helped convince me that Audrey never cheated on me and my thinking that she had cheated was the big reason that kept us from getting back together." 

 Of course they didn't know and I was never going to let them know that my getting back with Audrey had indeed started out to be an arrangement to protect me from them. 

 "Okay daddy" Bev said, "If you are sure that is what you want to do we will try to like her, but it will be hard." 

 "Why?" 

 "Oh come on dad" Bev said, "You know we both still want to climb in your bed and your wife will be it the way." 

 "Why won't the two of you accept that it is never going to happen?" 

 Barb chuckled and said, "Never is a long time daddy and over time things can change." 

 "Well little girl, one thing that hasn't changed is that dinner clean-up is still your job so get to it." 

 I didn't get much sleep that night. In my mind was the thought that the twins knew Audrey would be moving back in the next day and they might see that since I would be alone that night it might be a good time to take a shot at me. I remembered their plan that had brought the mother into my bed and every little noise had me looking at the bedroom door, but morning came without my having to fight them off. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x  

 

 ****** Rob's Saga Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© When I got home from work that night I found that Audrey had taken a day off from work and had used that day to move back into the house. She and the girls were in the kitchen making dinner and since they weren't scowling at each other I assumed that things were so far okay. Barb said: 

 "Dinner will be ready in about five minutes daddy" and I saw Audrey give a quick glance Barb's way. I would bet that that "daddy" was Barb's way of letting Audrey know that she was staking a claim to part of me and letting Audrey know that there was a strong relationship there that Audrey wasn't going to be allowed to mess with. 

 Dinner conversation was mostly Audrey and the girls getting to know each other. Audrey wanted to know about what they liked in school, did they have boyfriends, what they wanted to do when they got out of school and other stuff like that. The twins wanted to know about Audrey and in the process I found out about things that I hadn't known. Before the split Audrey had worked part time in a clothing store, but while she was gone she had taken classes at the community college and had gotten a full time job as a legal secretary and was still taking classes to become a paralegal. The three women seemed to like each other enough to get along and that is all I cared about. 

 The girls were off doing there homework and Audrey and I were sitting on the couch in the living room when she said: 

 "Daddy? They call you daddy?" 

 "I had no say in the matter Aud. It is what they decided they wanted to call me." 

 "Still, I have a hard time seeing you as a daddy." 

 "It is just a term of affection Aud, not a description of what or who I am. According to what Kari once told me they have always wanted a father figure in their lives and I guess they decided that it was going to be me." 

 "I think I like them Rob and I hope they like me." 

 That night when we went to bed I was wearing pajamas. Since I usually sleep naked it was my way of letting Audrey know that there was not going to be any sex. When she got in bed she moved over to snuggle up to me and I moved away from her. She rolled over on her side and we both went to sleep. 

 I woke up with a hot mouth on my dick and in my half asleep half awake state I thought it was Kari, but then I remembered that she was gone and I thought it must be that Bev or Barb had come into the room. I was all set to panic when I remembered that Audrey was there. By the time I had worked it all out in my head Audrey had impaled herself on my cock and was riding me. I tensed and Audrey hissed: 

 "Don't even think about it. Try to push me away and I'll sink my nails so deep into you I'll tear chunks out of you as you push me off." 

 She needn't have bothered with the threat because by then the little head had taken control away from the big head. 

 "It has been too damned long for me baby. Tomorrow we can make love, but tonight we fuck." 

 And we did. Three times and Audrey wanted a fourth, but I could not get it back up. She tried though. She spent twenty minutes on me with her mouth, but it just would not get up to play. Finally she looked down at me and said: 

 "You bastard! You were fucking Kari weren't you? 

 I just shrugged and she went on, "No way you could have lasted as long as you did if you had gone without since I've been gone." 

 Again all I could do was shrug. 

 "Not fair. If Kari would have been honest with me I might have been able to play a little too and I wouldn't have suffered so much. Not fair at all." 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Over the next month Audrey did her best to try and make up for lost time. It was two and sometimes three times a night every night and I went to work in the morning exhausted. Finally she must have figured that she had caught up enough to back off a bit. The love making slacked off to three or four times a week and usually only one time a night. 

 Audrey and the twins had settled into a sisterly type relationship with Audrey being the big sister. They went shopping for clothes together and Audrey took them to the beauty parlor she went to. It was the twin's first visit to a hair dresser and they couldn't wait to get home and show me their new hair style. Yes, style, not styles. They were still doing the twin thing and trying to stay alike. 

 It was coming up and the twin's eighteenth birthday and graduation was going to be the same week. The girls had earned some scholarships and they both planned on attending the community college to work on nursing degrees. Audrey was still taking evening classes three nights a week to get what she needed to become a paralegal and the girls were pumping her about what college was like. Audrey tried to talk them into attending a regular school for nursing, but the girls insisted on going the community college route. It seemed to upset Audrey, but I didn't think anything of it at the time. 

 Because Bev and Barb's birthday and graduation fell in the same week Audrey decided to throw them a combination birthday and graduation party. The house was full of kids and I was kept busy making sure that nothing happened that would get the police or other parents involved. Twice I caught kids sneaking away to drink from a bottle that they had stashed and once I had to chase a couple out of one of the bedrooms, but all in all it was a good party. 

 Audrey and I were in the kitchen cleaning up and Barb came in to help. "Where's Bev" I asked. 

 "She and Marv are on the swing in the back yard necking. I don't know what she sees in him; he is such a twit." 

 Audrey giggled and said, "Twits need loving too." 

 "She probably thinks the same about Randy" I said. 

 "Oh puleease" Barb snorted, "Randy is just a date and I don't have any interest in him." 

 "Is that why you sat in his car steaming up the windows when he brought you home last night?" 

 "I didn't say that I didn't like him, just that he is nobody special." 

 "Right!" Audrey and I said almost in unison. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 The twins got jobs for the summer, the months flew by and suddenly the girls were off to college. Before the month was out Bev had come up with a steady boyfriend and for the first time since I met them they were spending much more time apart than had been the norm. Barb seemed content to play the field. 

 Audrey was working hard at trying to prove to me that I was the love of her life, but as I told her before she ever moved back in that getting my trust back was going to be a hard thing for her to do. I watched her for any sign that all wasn't as it should be. She had evening classes on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and one Wednesday I actually parked down the street from where she worked and followed her to see where she went after work. She drove to the college, got out of her car with a book bag and walked into one of the buildings. 

 The holidays came around and with them the usual parties. Audrey and I had a good time at my company Christmas party, but I couldn't say the same for hers. I got the definite impression from the people she worked with that as a production line supervisor I was beneath them and when Audrey introduced me to the lawyer whose secretary she was I took an instant dislike to the man. I can't explain why, but I did not like him. Maybe it was the way he looked at me or maybe it was his hand shake, but I knew right away that I didn't like and would never like Mark Hathaway. I did my best to be sociable for Audrey's sake, but I was more than happy to say goodnight to the whole bunch when the party broke up. 

 Christmas Eve at the dinner table Bev asked, "Does anybody notice anything different?" as she patted her hair with her left hand. I didn't catch it, but Audrey did and shortly after Audrey said, "Oh my God" Barb squealed "When?" 

 "Yesterday" Bev said as she stuck her hand out to show off the engagement ring. "Benny proposed last night when he brought me home. We aren't going to get married until I get my degree, but Benny said he had to ask now before someone else beat him to it." 

 Then Barb and Audrey started with the questions. "Did he go down on his knee?" "What did he say?" "Were you surprised" and on and on. I got up and left the three of them there yakking away. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 It was a Wednesday in February -- the day before Valentines Day - and Bev was out somewhere with Benny and Audrey was at her Wednesday night class. Barb and I were home alone. 

 "Can I ask you something personal dad?" 

 "Sure you can sweetie, but I may not answer you." 

 "Is everything okay between you and Audrey?" 

 "As far as I know. Why do you ask?" 

 "Just curious." 

 "Bullshit baby girl. You don't do anything for no reason. What prompted that question?" 

 "I'm sorry I asked. It isn't any of my business anyway" 

 "But you did ask Barb, so give." 

 "It is just that Audrey is supposed to be taking evening classes like I am, but I never see her there and the place isn't so big that we shouldn't run into each other every once in a while." 

 "I don't know why you never see each other, but to answer your question everything id fine with us." 

 At least I thought it was, but was it? 

 Thursday I was parked down the street from the law offices of Bingham, Bingham and Hathaway when Audrey came out the front door on the arm of Mark Hathaway. The got into his Cadillac Escalade and drove off with me following. They drove to a gated community out near the country club. I had no way to follow them inside so I parked where I could watch the gate. Three hours later the Escalade came out and I followed it back to the BB and H employee lot. Audrey got out of the car, leaned back inside and gave Hathaway a kiss and then walked to her car. 

 I shot home and was there sitting on the couch watching TV when she got home. She breezed in, kissed me and told me that it had been a rough day at work followed by a bad night at school because one of her instructors had picked the paper she had just turned in to pieces. 

 "I'm going to go soak in the tub and then we can go to bed and you can console me. Sound like a plan?" 

 I wasn't quite ready to confront her so I just smiled and said, "You bet." I managed to get through the weekend without strangling her and Monday I followed her and Hathaway again. Wednesday she did actually go to school, but Thursday it was back to the gated community again. I knew all I needed to know so I drove on home and began to make plans. 

 Audrey was history and that was a given, but I needed a way to get back at Hathaway so I was stuck with pretending that all was well with Audrey and me until I could come up with a plan. Over the next two weeks I came up with a dozen plans, but every one of them turned out to have a glitch. I could have just caught Hathaway alone somewhere and stomped the fuck out of him, but that isn't what I wanted. I wanted to ruin him. I wanted to sue him for alienation of affections and smear his reputation as a lawyer. Maybe do a good enough job that his partners would kick him out of the firm. To get what I needed though I needed a way to get into his gated community so I could peek in his windows and take photos or kick down his door and get pictures of Audrey and him doing the dirty. 

 I made an appointment with a private detective and he told me that there wasn't any way that I could get what I really needed. He said he could arrange to be inside the gate when Hathaway and Audrey got there and take pictures of Audrey going inside the town home, but those pictures would prove nothing other than Audrey had visited. Even if he could get inside Hathaway's place and plant video cameras and recording devices their product would be inadmissible as evidence because they would have been illegally obtained. His advice to me was to suck it up, sue using Irreconcilable Differences and be done with it. 

 I was sitting o0n the couch with a beer in my hand and staring at the wall trying to think of some way to fuck Hathaway when Audrey came into the room and sat down beside me. 

 "Where are you right now?" 

 "What?" 

 "You have been distant lately and here you are sitting and staring at the wall. So where are you right now? Where is tour head?" 

 I didn't say anything, just looked at her and she reached over and touched me. 

 "You know don't you?" 

 I looked at her and nodded my head yes. 

 "The girls are going on a ski trip with some friends this weekend and I was going to tell you then while we were alone, but I guess now is as good a time as any. I love you Rob, I really and truly do, but it isn't working out. It isn't your fault. I am the one who made it so you would never trust me again and the ironic part is that even though I never did what made you distrust me in the first place you were right in not trusting me when I came back. 

 "I really did want to put us back together and I have tried my damndest since I've been back, but it hasn't gotten me anywhere and I've come to realize that it never will. We have sex, but you have never really made love to me since I've been back and we don't snuggle and cuddle like we used to. You barely show me any affection at all. In a way you are to blame for what has been going on because you are the one who kept pounding it home that you doubted that we would ever make it. I came home with high hopes, but in the back of my mind I always doubted that you would ever accept me again. I convinced myself that the only reason you let me come back was so that I could be your protection against the girls. 

 "I lied and I am sure that you know I did when I said I had never had sex while we were apart. I never did before I left, but I couldn't go without forever and I started an affair with Mark about three months after I started working for the firm. It was supposed to be just a friends with benefits kind of thing at first. I told him up front that I still loved you and intended to get back with you somehow. He accepted that and even tried to help. He was the one who suggested the trial separation to force counseling, but we know how that turned out. Over the course of our friends with benefits relationship Mark fell in love with me. I liked him, I liked him a lot, but my level of affection for him wasn't anywhere close to how I felt about you. I made it plain to Mark that you were my guy and he loved me enough to want to see me happy so he accepted that I was always going to want you first and he accepted what little I would give him. 

 "Then we talked and you agreed to let me come home and that is where I failed you. No matter how much I loved you, no matter how bad I wanted it to work out I didn't think that it would because of your constantly telling me how hard it would be for you to ever trust me again and so I hung onto Mark as my security blanket and I would meet him once a week or so to keep him interested in me. I really did have classes on the nights I said I did, but six weeks ago I tested out of my Monday and Thursday classes. This last month I finally accepted that you and I were never going to be any more than friendly roommates and friendly roommates just isn't enough for me Rob. I love you too much to just settle for that. I started spending my now freed up Mondays and Thursdays with Mark and thinking about what I should do. I decided to do both of us a favor and end it. 

 "I'm going to file for divorce using Irreconcilable Differences and Mark is going to handle it for me. I won't be asking for anything except the end of the marriage. After a suitable length of time I will most likely marry Mark. I know I will never love him as deeply as I've loved you, but at least he wants me. All of me. I'm sorry it didn't work out Rob. God knows I would have given anything to make it work, but I guess some things are just not to be." 

 She leaned over, kissed me and said, "I'll sleep in the spare bedroom tonight and move out while you are at work tomorrow." 

 She got up and left the room, but paused at the stairs and said, "Don't ever doubt it Rob; I do love you" and then she went up the stairs and she was gone when I got home from work the next day.

 It happened just as she said. I was served and she asked for nothing. I didn't even have to get an attorney; all I had to do was sign the papers and send them back. That's all, just sign them and send them back, but for some strange reason I didn't do it. I tossed the papers on the desk in the den and left them lie there. 

 For the next week the twins tried to cheer me up telling me that it was all for the best, that it was obvious that it was never going to work out, that it was never meant to be and other such platitudes. One night I woke up as someone climbed into bed with me and Barb's voice said: 

 "Relax daddy. Your pee-pee is safe. I just thought you needed someone to hold you and I appointed myself as the holder." 

 We fell asleep in each other's arms. The next night it was Bev and the night after that it was Barb again. For the next week the girls rotated and surprisingly enough they behaved. 

 Until one Monday morning. 

 I woke up with Barb's hand on my cock. I went to push it away, but she held on to it. 

 "I told you the other night that your pee-pee was safe, but I had to let you know that I still want it. I'm over eighteen daddy and I'm totally legal and I dearly want what I have in my hand, but you have to be the one to make it happen. There won't be any sneak attacks from me. No ropes around the chair; no waking you up with blow jobs in the middle of the night. I'm yours if you want me, but you will have to be the one to make it happen." 

 She let go of my cock, kissed me and then said, "I've got an eight o'clock this morning and I'm going to have to hurry to make it" and she got up and left the room leaving me with a seriously hard dick. 

 Barb and Bev were indeed both legal and they had both wanted to be in my bed. I didn't know about Bev now that she was engaged to Benny, but it was obvious that Barb was ready. 

 One thing I had never done was lie to myself. I had lusted after both of the girls since the day that Kari had brought them to the house. It was only my determination not to go to jail as a child molester that had kept me away from them. That fear was now gone, but something else had taken its place. That night when Barb came home I told her flat out that what she wanted could never be. 

 "You are legal sweetie and I will admit that I have always wanted you, but there is something in the way. Even though there are no blood ties between us you are my daughter. Your mother with her dying breath entrusted you to me. I promised her that I would take care of you and I was aware that what she was asking of me was that I keep you safe. To me that meant safe from all harm and safe from what your mother feared most and that was that you and I or Bev and I would have sex. Your mom was so dead set against that ever happening that she put herself in my bed to keep you out of it. I will not betray your mother's trust. You are my girl, my baby, my daughter and as such I will never touch you in the way you want. I will love you and cherish you as a father should and that will have to be enough for you." 

 Tears started flowing and she cried out, "That's just not fair" as she ran from the room. As I watched her go I thought, "Maybe not fair baby girl, but it is what's right."

 Audrey was surprised when she came out of the offices of BB and H with Hathaway to find me sitting on the sidewalk on a folding chair. I pointed to the other folding chair and said "sit!" She looked from me to Mark and then back at me and then she sat down. I handed her the divorce papers and said: 

 "If you look you will see that they are not signed. Before you ask me why I have a few things to say. I cheated you when I told you that you could come back and try to put things back together. I let you come back and all the while in the back of my mind I had the thought that it was never going to happen. I had already made up my mind that you were going to leave me again in your search for fun and excitement and why wouldn't you? I was an unexciting stick in the mud and I knew it and I also knew that was who I was and that I wasn't going to change. So not really believing we had a chance I didn't try. I went through the motions with one eye on the calendar trying to pick out the day, week or month when it would happen. What is so stupid about it is that I really did want it to work. I did want us to put things back together.  

 

 ****** Rob's Saga Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "Everyone knows that the brain needs oxygen to function properly, but I had my head so far up my ass where you were concerned that my brain wasn't getting any oxygen. When Barb tipped me to the fact that you weren't at school on Mondays and Thursdays I followed you and saw where you went. I remembered back to when you first came home how upset you seemed to get when the girls said no to a regular nursing school and insisted on going the community college route and I figured that it was because you were afraid they would find out that you didn't really take classes and they would tell me. Following you to Hathaway's told me that you had been fucking him all along. That made me believe that along with my not believing we could make it you weren't even intending to try. You were playing some kind of game. Setting me up so you could leave me in some nasty way to get even with me for tossing you out. Why else would you be wasting your time with me and spending your evenings with your boyfriend here?" 

 Hathaway gave me a nasty look and Audrey started to say something, but I held up my hand to cut her off. 

 "Let me finish and then you can have your say. On your last day you said that you would have given anything to make it work. The sad thing is that even though I wanted it to work I gave nothing. So here it is Audrey. I am willing to give everything and do anything to try and make it work. I have no way of knowing if you still feel that way. You have the divorce papers in your hand. Take them with you and think about them. If they show up in my mailbox in a day or so I will sign them and send them back." 

 I stood up and turned to go. I hadn't taken three steps when Audrey called my name. I turned and she held the divorce papers up in front of her and tore them in half, dropped them on the ground and then ran to me. As I held her Hathaway walked up and said: 

 "If you hurt her you will answer to me." 

 I looked at him for a couple of seconds and then I smiled and said, "I could almost learn to like you." Report_Story
