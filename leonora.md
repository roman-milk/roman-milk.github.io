Leonora

#1

It was the usual Monday morning with Leonora feeling washed out. It was difficult to think straight, though this would soon pass after a second coffee. She looked at the tired eyes staring back at her in the restroom mirror. She made funny faces, stretching the facial muscles in an attempt to ease the signs of weariness. 

Standing up straight on tiptoe, pushing back her shoulders in an exaggerated pose a pair of ample breasts were impressively emphasised. Critically examining the image she felt pleased at how trim her figure had become over the past few months. Somehow it had been possible to keep to yet another diet. 

At five foot five it was important not to look dumpy so honing a trim little waist helped settle that problem. Looking over her shoulder at a hard rounded bottom she breathed a noise of satisfaction. "It will do!" she sighed. 

Looking into the tired face again she wondered for a moment when it had become so important to look after her body. At twenty-four it was a little too early to be worried about ageing. She wasn't looking for a man. On leaving college Leonora had made a life plan and right now it meant working on building a career. 

On reflection she considered the business suit skirt was a little too short. An idea came to mind that this new outfit had been a reward for coming down a size. Staring in the mirror she wondered if a little too much cleavage was on show. 

She wrinkled her nose in thought about the diet. It was curious how her breasts were larger yet her waist and tummy were trim. Good looks did help, had helped. As head of the department she was off the bottom rung of the corporate ladder ready to take another step up. 

*** 

On seeing Rodney enter the purchasing office she suspected something was wrong. Rodney was the chairman's son and one of those annoying people who liked you to know it. Why was he slumming down here among the workers? A hasty swallow of caffeine added to the adrenalin rush. She was now alert at this sign of danger. 

The triumphal gait of his walk continued unimpeded despite the smiles and quick words doled out as he passed upturned faces. He leaned into her office. "Did you enjoy the party?" He asked. "So, your favourite song is Lucky!" 

How did he know about a friend's party over the weekend? It irritated her that she couldn't remember seeing him there. The more she thought about it the party shimmered like a hot roadway hiding the way back. 

It must have been good. "It was good. Thank you for asking," she had almost told him she didn't remember much but it was important to portray an image of responsibility and respectability. She didn't want him to think she was a drunken party girl. 

He smiled and turned away. "Hell! Party girl?" she exclaimed quietly. Where did that idea come from? 

"Not more urgent reports surely!" Eileen, her secretary complained. 

Nervously straightening and tugging at the short skirt Leonora pulled herself together. "No. He just came in to thank us for the ones we completed last week," she said. 

Eileen looked at the door he had just closed behind him. "Well. That is something new. Stop fiddling with that skirt woman. If you're uncomfortable wearing it leave it at home tomorrow. Go back to something you feel more comfortable in." Eileen knew her boss wouldn't listen but said it anyway, as the department nursemaid forever dishing out advice, wanted or not. 

With everyone's head down the muttering elapsed enough for Leonora to return to her office; satisfied everyone was working hard. 

Apart from vague snippets of conversations all she was left with was a lingering pleasant feeling that she enjoyed a party at the weekend. There was not a single definite thing about it she could remember. Was he there? 

There was no way she would have been singing at a party, unless perhaps they had a karaoke machine and she was very drunk. The words of the song triggered a memory and curiosity. "Lucky, lucky, lucky, I'm a lucky party girl," she quietly sung. 

The words seemed familiar but not right and definitely something she wouldn't sing. Leonora was far too sensible to make a fool of her self. What had she done at the party and was it in front of him? He seemed to have such a smug smile upon his face as though he knew something. 

It had probably been as dreary as usual with time spent listening to a strangers boring lecture about business. The thought that the party had been the same as usual implied she often went to parties, which was a surprising idea, yet it sat in her mind refusing to leave. 

It tied in with these Monday morning heavy feelings. What had she done each weekend for the last six months? Her diary was well maintained up to six months ago with neat scribbles about decorating and weekend chores, both dull and tiresome, yet right now very comforting entries, then nothing. What had she been up to the last six months? Why hadn't she noticed this before? 

"Leonora, Leonora. Are you in yet or still home painting the ceiling." Leonora's secretary was not exactly respectful of her boss but she did an excellent job of bringing everything together, especially on a Monday morning. 

"What do you mean, painting the ceiling?" Leonora asked. Sharing gossip together would soon bring her round, back to the normal world of chaos that was usual in the office. 

"Friday you said you were spending the weekend painting a spare bedroom ceiling. Anyway, you have the usual meeting to start the week then it's the usual department rounds." Eileen stated. 

The rounds were what they called checking up on each of the staff to ensure they were not just sitting waiting for something to do. It happened, but not since they started the rounds. First, she had to attend the inter-departmental meeting. She looked at the reports then at Eileen, and they pulled the ritual faces, "Ugh!" they said in unison. 

"You're not smoking," Leonora said, accusingly, as though it were an omission in her secretary's duties. 

"I wondered when you would notice!" she giggled. "I've been going to a hypnotist. It's great. It's working. It's almost painless. I hardly remember having smoked let alone wanting to smoke," she enthused to Leonora, who at that moment was more friend than boss. 

A curious thought dominated the day that just couldn't be shaken off. It led her to ask Eileen for the hypnotist's telephone number and taking the considerable step of actually dialling to make an appointment. 

*** 

If there hadn't been a free slot that very afternoon the unsettled mood may have been shrugged off with the whole thing being dropped, yet she was there sitting before him, feeling confused. At first she felt embarrassed telling him of a vague uncomfortable feeling she had but then his professional skill was to help a client relax. 

"One of the girls is arranging a party and was talking about outfits on a web site. When she laughed about one of them, a party pet..." She broke off with a shudder. "It left me with an uncomfortable image. I was dressed as a party pet surrounded by men. I don't know what it means but its frightening." 

For a moment it was reassuring not to be paranoid as there was an explanation for these vague feelings of unease. He explained that a hypnotic suggestion was hindering a real memory. He told her she had been hypnotised with a suggestion planted deeply in her mind and that it has been strengthened over the last six months to become a powerful influence. 

"Until we can identify what the trigger is, it will be difficult to identify and just as difficult to remove. There are probably several instructions deeply embedded within your subconscious with at least one of them preventing you from remembering what it is your compelled to do at the weekend," he told her. 

In a daze Leonora sat listening wondering how it could have happened. 

"You won't be able to remember much about the party while under such a deep hypnotic influence but there is a possibility of adding to the command, something extra, one of my commands," the therapist told her. 

"You should consider reporting this to the police. Alright, we'll find out what it is all about first." 

Running away would be of no use. If she were to leave the area they might find her and keep her forever suspended in that terrible acquiescent state rather than just at weekends. 

She agreed with the therapist to carry on as normal so as not to alert them to her growing awareness. 

*** 

Friday night came around slowly enough to keep her strung out with nervous tension for what seemed weeks not days. Tired from the busy week it seemed something of an anticlimax as she slumped on a favourite comfy sofa before the television. 

As usual her head nodded with weariness for a few minutes until she awoke feeling more wretched than when arriving home from the office. Leonora had a vague feeling she should be doing something. 

"Preparing for work tomorrow? No not that," she said to herself while drifting into the kitchen for a snack. It was Sunday evening; a whole forty-eight hours since arriving from work on Friday and she hadn't given a thought to the lost time. 

In the kitchen she read what looked like a shopping list attached to the fridge with a pig magnet. A curious phrase was written among the list of groceries. Without a thought to what she was doing she walked to her spare room and sat at a desk to scribble in the diary. 

*** 

Monday morning she awoke in the usual state of confusion. In the kitchen she looked at the curious note stuck on the fridge. A phrase caught her attention. A flash of an idea struck her and she remembered the therapist giving her this piece of paper and a command. 

She ran to the small study and sat at the desk. In trepidation she looked for the diary. The hypnotist had said it might not work. It was missing. There on the desk was a pen but no diary. Had it been written up or thrown out? Shuffling papers in a draw she found it buried among bills waiting to be paid. 

Unsure of herself she made a pot of coffee then hesitantly opened the book. From a quick glance she saw there were fresh notes there and poured a second cup. There was a nervous tremble in her hands so she took a deep breath to steady her nerves. 

Looking at the rough scrawl she saw an unsteady script that was obviously hers. So now she would find out what had been going on every weekend for the last six months. 

Sunday's entry, "This weekend I was a party pet. Leonard wasn't in this evening otherwise I would have been his plaything. It is better when he keeps me for himself. Later I sung my song. 'Licky, licky, licky. I'm a licky girl. Ready to lick, lick, lick.'" 

While reading the hasty scribble Leonora put a hand to her mouth. The meaning seemed somehow familiar yet she dare not think what a party pet was. Then she had become a lick girl? How did she lick the other guests? A shudder ran through her body as the worst of ideas numbed her mind. 

She needed to leave for the office but another cup of coffee was desperately needed first. She wanted it all to be a hoax or trick of some kind. Even madness might be more acceptable. On the way to the office she calmed down enough to present a cool exterior to the staff. Hidden in her private office she pretended to study reports. 

On the phone she found the therapist was away ill."He left a letter for you. We don't have your address on file so could you pick it up? It will be in reception for you." 

Leaving work early she picked up the letter and once safe in her car tore at the envelope. She read it over again. He would be back soon but in the mean time she had to decide whether to go along with the usual weekend routine or report it to the police. 

Damn! That wasn't any good. All week she fretted over what to do. She had remembered a little more of the party room but none of the faces were brought into focus or what she had actually done there. 

Friday night came around suddenly without a decision being made. As usual she plonked a tired body onto the sofa wondering what to do. Leonora looked at the telephone still unable to find the strength to face the embarrassment of asking someone for help. Her head began to nod with fatigue. 

*** 

She awoke with a gasp of fright. She had dozed on the couch longer than expected and had to rush out quickly with no time to catch a bite to eat. Fumbling with car keys she managed get the thing started and backed out onto the road without hitting anything. 

Running into the back kitchen of the large mansion house Leonora was breathing heavily. A glance at the large clock in passing showed she was only just on time so must get changed quickly to avoid a spanking. 

Leonora smoothed down the little black outfit over her hips before entering the party. Catching sight of the outfit in a mirror dashed all confidence. It wasn't a fancy dress party yet she was wearing a bunny outfit with perky ears and white cuffs. Almost everyone else was wearing elegant gowns or suits. 

It made her feel even more insignificant and unsure of herself. Her master had left it in her room so surely it wasn't a mistake. She felt such a silly little thing, like a little pet ready to scamper away to hide from all the big important people. 

Before she could figure out what to do Jonathan strode up to her. "So there you are. I want you to join that group of guests like the good little pet you are. You should know what to do by now," he told her. 

He straightened the black bowtie at her neck and patted her bare bottom to hurry her into the party. 

Leonora looked down in deference to him, which was a mistake. How had she not seen the state she was in while changing? Her breasts were pushed up into a large cleavage ready to bounce out of the low cut top. Her chest was flushed so her face must be crimson with embarrassment. 

Everyone looked so formal and here she was only half dressed. The little tight outfit was high cut over her hips, pulling it between her cheeks. The bunny ears and cuffs made her look as silly as she felt. The high heels gave her some height but she had to walk with a posture that pushed out the large bouncing bust. 

Although it had a built in corset hugging her waist tight and pushing her breasts up, the rest of the material was absurdly thin. With every step she felt it cutting her in two. Any moment the crotch might disappear between her lips. She wanted to turn and flee out of the room but in dismay found it impossible to turn around. 

Compelled to walk on she hesitated joining the group of guests. She dallied on the periphery of the group hearing them talking business. How she had come to be a bunny girl waitress was still a mystery. If she could keep calm and find out the therapist would help her out of this mess. 

Her resolve weakened with panic threatening. 'What the hell am I doing here like this? It feels like a dream so why can't I wake up? Please let me be asleep on my sofa,' she took a step back almost tumbling in the high heels. 

A man took a hold of her elbow to steady her. "So what do you do, little bunny girl?" Robert asked, with the look of a predatory wolf upon his face. 

Opening her mouth to protest at such a demeaning remark she instead batted a set of long eyelashes. "I'm a party girl, sir. I'm your little bunny tonight, sir," Leonora stuttered. The little squeaky voice was bad enough but the lisp was damned annoying. 

If her colleagues could see her now she would die of shame. The thought rolled through her mind like a lonely tumble weed. The thought rolled out again leaving an empty feeling without the slightest recollection of what it meant. 

She beamed at the man attempting to be a little winsome pet, succeeding sweetly. There, that was better. This is what she had been trained for. She knew what to do now. 

Leonora was in the middle of the group of smart expensively dressed men being examined. She had their full attention and revelled in it. She swung her hips from side to side and put a finger to her lips. 

"Can I do anything for you, sirs?" she giggled. 

"You certainly can," Robert said. 

"You already are, sweet lips," Philip admitted, hinting at a tent in his trousers. 

"I can just imagine those luscious lips wrapped around my penis," Robert added. 

"Yes, sir," Leonora spoke up looking at a hardness in his trousers. As she bent over attempting to kneel, a difficult operation in the high heels, one of them grabbed her shoulder. 

"Not here you silly little slut! Where does he get these slutty bimbos from?" Peter asked of no-one in particular. "It's against the rules," he told her firmly. 

A little sigh of relief escaped between her pursed lips. She licked them nervously. 'How the hell could I have been prepared to go down on this man. Right here in a room full of strangers,' Leonora wondered in horror. 

It sounded and looked as though she were disappointed not to have been allowed to blow him. Their reaction was to be expected. They sneered at her sluttish behaviour but nevertheless savoured the idea. 

"Nice breasts," Robert commented and took hold of a nipple through the thin material to tease it. 

"Careful you're not seen, by Jonathan," Peter cautioned. "She has a nice ass too," he murmured to himself. 

In dismay she felt her pussy lips reacting as though the swelling nipple was a bell pull connected directly to her pussy demanding attention. Any more stimulation and her lips would swallow the little piece of material covering them. 

She wore no panties in the tight outfit so there was nothing but a thin purse holding her little private place. She was fearful that her aroused state would be noticed. 'Why in hell am I reacting this way? It's terrible. A complete stranger is toying with me and I can't stop him!' Leonora guessed this unwanted reaction was part of the training the master had mentioned. 

She was reacting strongly, swaying with passion, leaning toward those invigorating fingers as they worked her body up. Was it the training or because it was happening in front of others or his expertise? She was too far gone to bother working it out. 

"If she's this hot from pinching her nipples she'll sizzle now," Philip said. He took hold of one of her lips that had unrolled around the bunny outfit crotch. With the others shielding him he stroked her hot lips, running a finger nail over them. 

'This can't be happening! I'm so turned on I'm helpless. Sandwiched between these men I can't back away, I can't move!' Leonora couldn't bring her mind under control while being swamped with overpowering sensations. Even without the stimulation it would have been impossible to resist after months of deep hypnosis but she didn't know that. 

Retreating into a shell she just let it happen, even pushing her body against the fingers toying with her body. 

"Careful! Jonathan's looking this way," Peter warned. 

Relieved that they were leaving her to calm down, and more so that it was against the rules, she took a deep breath. Her nerves were shattered. If only she could walk away from them. 

"Go to the bar and fetch the drinks. They know our order." Peter told her. He kept an eye on Jonathan and relaxed on seeing him turn to another group once the slut had walked away from them. 

The woman before her was dressed as a sexy cheerleader, giggling and speaking with a little girly voice, despite being in her late twenties. Her age made the display all the more lurid with a skirt that just covered her hips and a top that hid nothing from the imagination. The woman wiggled her hips leaving Leonora wondering how the stupid slut would manage the tray without spilling anything. 

While waiting her turn she had a chance to think. It seemed she was compelled to serve with her mind going blank when carrying out instructions. At least she was just a waitress and there were rules against being touched. Even though they took advantage of the vulnerable state it was some small consolation.  

===

The woman preparing the drinks was dressed in a corset with suspenders holding sheer black stockings. Her breasts balanced over the top of the corset and her ass was bare. When she bent over Leonora noticed she wasn't wearing panties so felt properly dressed in comparison. 

Nervously she walked back with the tray hoping not to spill the two brandies and two whiskeys. While concentrating hard on keeping the tray balanced she didn't notice the man approach until he spoke. Everyone else was in a huddle around some woman as scantily dressed as she was. 

"Hello, how are you this evening?" he asked. 

At first the impulse to scurry back to her group of men, as ordered, drove her on. He stepped in front of her forcing her to stop. Looking into his face she saw who it was. 

Rodney! It was someone who knew her, someone who could save her from this dreadful place. 

Leonora looked at him with pleading eyes unable to speak. She hardly knew what to say but couldn't get the words out even if she brought her racing thoughts together. 

"You look ravishing pet," he said. 

The word help would do but all she managed was, "Thank you, sir." Instead of imploring him for help with her eyes they were disobeying her by batting the long lashes at him seductively. 

He had a hand on her ass pumping a cheek as he told her, "Your a sexy little vamp aren't you," he chuckled. 

She wanted to cry out in protest, for help, but stood there mesmerised. This man was in her office this afternoon working through a financial report and now he was stroking her bare ass. Leonora felt a wave of anguish swamp her as he stared, smirking at her erect nipples. 

"You're all ready for action I see," he commented casually. 

Seeing the quizzical look on her face he looked round for Jonathan then reached between her legs. 

Leonora felt her boss's finger stroke a lip. It was swollen and wet. Her pussy had burst from the crotch of the little bunny outfit leaving her exposed. Her legs trembled with the disbelief of such a wretched disgrace. 

He put a finger to her mouth and she smelt her own nasty juices on his finger. She wanted to bite it off but instead opened her mouth to suck it clean. She licked his finger wrapping her tongue suggestively around it. 

The shock of automatically performing such a lewd act helped break her free. "Please, sir," she croaked. At last she had overcome the inhibition to speak her mind. 

"What do you want little party pet?" he asked. 

Summoning all her will she formed the plea. She needed him to get her out of there. She was a mature business woman not some silly little pet. They had her dressed and behaving like a hot slut; she just had to escape. 

"I want to, I want to cum, please sir," she lisped. 

"You're a well trained party pet girl. Jonathan has done a good job on you," he laughed. He took a hold of her shoulder and guided her back to the group of men. 

Leonora couldn't believe what she had said to her boss. This afternoon she had been a responsible woman running an important department. To be reduced to this over sexed pet slut was so degrading she couldn't take much more. 

There was nothing she could do about it for the moment so gave in. Her thoughts retreated away from the room, further and further with each step, leaving the vacuous party pet to get on with it. 

"Here she is, you're little pet with the drinks. You're lucky to have her serving you; she's one of the best. What do you do best bunny girl?" Rodney asked. 

"I fuck wike a wikle wandy bunny wabit," Leonora lisped giggling cutely and put a finger to her mouth. With a slow exaggerated sucking movement she pulled her finger into her mouth through luscious pursed lips. She slurped on her finger running it in and out with a tongue flicking it until wet and slippery. 

She had their attention now, as instructed by the master. The little party pet felt pleased with herself. She ran a finger over a swollen bud and cooed with contentment. 

Peter cleared his throat. "I think we should finish these drinks somewhere more comfortable." None disagreed with him this time. They tossed coins and two of the coins came up heads. The two lucky men eagerly followed her to her private room. 

*** 

Leonora had retreated from consciousness leaving the party pet free of the inhibitions she had grown up with. A CD played quietly in the background as she sang her lick song. Peeling off the tight outfit she suggestively swung her hips at the two men. 

She crawled to Robert who sat on the edge of a large be to unzip and pull his hard member from the trousers. For a moment she gazed up at him from beneath his cock with a look of wonderment as though it were the biggest instrument she had ever seen. 

Her small hands made it look all the more impressive. Wetting her lips she sucked on its head all the time playing with his balls with a free hand. 

Peter couldn't resist the wiggling hips and what was brazenly displayed between them. On his knees he manoeuvred between her splayed legs to roughly bury his cock into her. 

His course jerking movements pushed Robert back onto the edge of the bed. The party girl's mouth was pushed onto the cock she had been teasing. Her head bobbed in time with the cock taking her from behind. With every deep stroke into her slutty cunt she sucked Roberts cock into her throat. 

For a moment she was pleased at how well she had been trained but all thoughts were quickly smothered by lustful pleasure. Feeling a cock shuddering with a jet of cum into her pussy she yelled around the cock in her mouth. A wisp of sound escaped saying she had cum though no-one cared. 

Peter kept his cock buried in the tight hole pressing against the soft round ass cheeks. The beautiful woman, almost half his age, was pinned like a butterfly, with his seed pumping into her. The satisfaction was all his without the need to think of hers. 

Robert had a hold of her head to slow her down. The intensity of sensations with her throat gripping his cock tight was more than he could withstand so he pushed her head back wanting it to last. Too late, he sprayed cum over her face. 

Through half open eyes he watched her licking his sperm from around her lips, as though it were delicious honey then carefully guide the rest into her mouth with a finger. He watched dreamily as the party girl drew his flaccid cock into her mouth to suck it clean. 

Finished with Robert she turned on Peter. He was sitting back on the floor with a big smile on his face. She crawled between his legs to clean him up. Her tongue licked him dry. With soft lips she kissed the end of his flaccid cock reverently in thanks for the orgasm. 

Robert watched her ass bobbing about while attending Peter. A pair of glistening pussy lips protruded rudely between her thighs captivating him like a snake in a basket dancing to the 'lick tune' still playing in the background. 

Rolling onto her back with legs splayed they watched her wipe between her legs with a finely manicured finger. The dribble of cum was sucked off the elegant finger which was carefully examined in case a drop of the succulent sperm had been missed. More precious liquid was found seeping from her honey pot so again it was wiped and sucked between luscious lips. 

Crawling from one to the other she kissed their cocks and zipped them up. "Thank you, sirs. Thank you for letting me pleasure you and letting me cum," she beamed at them. She had been programmed to be easily aroused and enjoy every moment of sex, any sex a man could dream of. 

While she showered they returned to the other two guests, like a tag team, sending them up to the party pet. 

***  

===

Rising late Leonora helped the other pets, some younger and some older, prepare for Saturday evening. Leonora hadn't the slightest recollection of serving her group of guests, again and again into the early hours of Saturday morning. 

Jonathan took her to one side preparing her for a guest with particular requirements. After six months of deeply embedded instruction it was simply a matter of telling her the role she was to play. 

Walking back to the main room the instructions permeated into her subconscious leaving her without a clue as to what had transpired between them. 

The guests arrived and she joined them. Still thinking of the silly party girl as a waitress she was relieved to take on a more mature role at this evening's party. Perhaps that had all been a dream or a mistake. That was it, it was a mistake and she was being rewarded. 

In an expensive business suit she stood with a drink in hand talking to a wealthy man she had been introduced to simply as Kirk. She still wasn't sure if it was his first name, or should she call him Mister Kirk. 

He was tall and wore a dark blue silk suit with razor sharp creases. The greying hair at his temples leant a certain dignity to his upright baring. He looked like an army major rather than a major player in the commodities market. 

Her dark hair was tied in a bun perched upon the back of her head and she wore just a touch of makeup. Leonora was relaxed as they pleasantly discussed a market segment she was familiar with. This was more to her liking and more fitting to her status. 

"It's rather warm in here do you mind if I remove my jacket, sir?" she asked. Calling him 'sir' smartly avoided the issue of his name. 

He courteously helped and folded it neatly over the back of a chair. 

The loose skirt was short and the white blouse tight about her ample bust. Under the blouse a corset held her breasts into a long cleavage without covering the nipples. 

She was completely unaware her nipples showed darkly through the starched white cotton. She didn't feel self-conscious at all as he looked into her eyes not down the deep cleavage. 

She pressed her thighs together feeling the stocking tops rasp. A tingling sensation between the legs warmed her nether lips. She hastily flicked a wet tongue over her lips and immediately hoped it wouldn't be interpreted as being suggestive. 

In a moment of distraction her hand knocked the jacket off the chair and she quickly bent to pick it up. In the shiny black high heels it was awkward and Leonora made a mess of what should have been a careful curtsy. 

Bent over the chair she presented a white panty clad bottom framed by suspenders and black stocking tops. Straightening up she carried on the conversation unaware of the slip-up. 

Listening to his advice she unconsciously twisted a button on the blouse loosening it another notch. She was still feeling hot. She looked down her nose at a silly little pet serving drinks as she helped herself to an ice-clinking glass from a silver tray. 

She was enjoying herself. She again tightened her thighs rubbing them together, squeezing the lips of her pussy. This powerful man was beguiling. The room was hot and his serious commanding presence was doing something to her. 

Unaware of the squirming motion Leonora gave no thought to the compunction that she must please a man. She continued to converse with utter disregard to her arousal and why she was there. 

"You're an impressive young woman. You have a good understanding of the market but what other skills have you developed?" Kirk asked, with a disarming smile. 

Leonora felt once again a self confidence as though she were in a business meeting with a client. With a smile she lifted a hand to proudly count off her achievements. 

"In the last six months I've cut costs in purchasing by ten percent. I've learnt to relax my throat to take a penis, retrained my department for a new computer system, enjoy the taste of semen, rationalised stock holdings throughout the organisation, strengthened my vagina muscles for a firmer grip, become an asset to the company and a hot party pet," she said proudly. 

"You have acquired some very interesting skills, I'm impressed," he told her. 

Blanking out the lewd statements she invitingly suggested, "Perhaps you might consider making use of my skills, sir." It was as though she were touting for a position and felt disloyal to her present employer, even a little naughty. 

"We should discus it in my office," he told her. 

Although a little confused as to why he had an office here she followed anyway. The expansive leather topped desk was worn with countless papers having passed back and forth over the years. 

"You have an important position in this company but your mistake has cost a great deal, far too much. I've brought you here to reprimand you, maybe even dismiss you," he warned her in a stern tone. 

He looked her over pleased with the way the young woman resembled his haughty executive assistant. Jonathan had met his expectations exceedingly well. Jonathan's office was not up to standard but it would do. 

Leonora felt terrible at having let him down so badly. A strong feeling of needing to atone for her wrong doing washed away doubts over what was happening. She just knew she held an important role in this man's organisation and was desperate to hold onto it. 

"I'm so sorry, sir. I'll make it up to you I promise. I know I can't ever repay what I lost. Please, sir, don't let me go. I'll do anything you wish. I deserve to be punished for what I did," she rambled on unsure what to say. 

She held an important position in the organisation and felt so lowly in this situation, grovelling before the boss. What could she do but submit to his demands to avoid dismissal. 

"You are right you'll never be able to pay back the funds you lost through negligence," he said, warming to his theme. The beautiful young woman looked so contrite he almost felt sorry for her. She had him believing the fantasy play. At least his cock did as it stiffened in his trousers. 

"You have behaved like a spoilt child rather than the responsible executive I expected you to be. Perhaps that is the solution. A punishment to fit the crime is in order. If you are to remain in this organisation something to remind you to behave properly is called for." 

"Bend over the desk. You will remember a spanking young woman. It will bring you down a peg or two," he demanded. 

"Oh, sir! I'm an important executive in your company. You can't expect me to..." she broke off unable to face the alternative, being thrown out with the loss of prestige she had worked so hard for. 

With one hand on her back he pressed her nose down where she smelt the leather of the old desk. 

"Lift your skirt up," he told her. 

Scrambling with the hem she managed to lift it around her waist while balancing on the desk with her forehead. She reached across to grip the edge pulling her body taught over her boss's desk. 

She was certainly learning humility. She felt so degraded, in her boss's office displaying her panties for a spanking. She was an important business woman being reduced to an errant school girl. She would never forget this but it was better than being fired. 

Leonora felt him pull her panties down and let go of the desk. She bit back the protest reminding her self he was right, she needed to be punished for the wrong doing. 'At least I won't be fired,' she thought. 

A slap to her rump brought out a stifled yelp. She gripped a hold of the desk again to prevent the dire need to leap up and run away. She felt his hard hand and heard the slap of her soft cheek, then the other cheek. 

The humiliation was difficult to withstand but some how she clung on. She just had to give in for a few moments of this dire punishment to save her position then all would return to normal. 

Six in all left her bottom burning. She lay there unable to move in a state of shock. 

"What's this young lady? Open your legs, wider," he demanded. 

Would the torment never end? What humiliation had she to forbear next? 

"Your wet!" his voice was scathing in condemnation. 

She didn't understand. A finger wiped between her legs revealing she was wet with arousal. Leonora hadn't realised but it was true, she had become hot from this humiliating punishment. She had let herself down yet again. 

Her boss pushed his fingers under her nose to smell the evidence of her excitement. Without thinking she licked his fingers clean. 

"You're not a decent lady you're a dirty little slut. What do you want now, slut? Tell me!" he demanded. 

Leonora wanted to wake up from this nightmare dreading the words that were forming. "I want your cock, sir, please sir, fuck me, let me cum," the demeaning plea left her panting. On tiptoe she lifted her hips offering up her sex to him in a quest for fulfilment. 

She knew she would do anything to feel the fullness inside she desperately needed. The baseness of that desire overtook her. She was no longer a respectable business woman but a wanton slut begging for cock. She knew it and despised herself but couldn't help it. 

"Please sir, fill my cunt, and make me cum. I need it, please!" she moaned. 

Leonora felt a tentative presence between the lips of her pussy and tried to push back on it. She needed to absorb his manhood into her body to feel it fill her aching hole. The need that had been building all evening was overwhelming. 

He held off wanting to take full advantage of her in his fantasy game. Bent over the desk like that she resembled his assistant so well it was a dream coming true. "What are you?" he asked. 

"I'm a dirty little slut, sir." 

"What do you want?" 

"I want your cock in my cunt, sir," she pleaded. 

"Whose cunt is it now?" he asked. 

"It's your cunt, sir. You own this hot cunt, sir. You can fuck it anytime you wish. Please sir, your little cunt needs your big strong cock now!" she cried out almost in pain from lust. So hot she was willing to do or say anything. 

Leonora cried out feeling him spear her with a strong thrust driving deep into her vagina. She gripped it with muscles taught to please a man feeling the ripples of sensations on inner walls stimulated by every movement of his hardness. 

She revelled in capturing every movement, every bounce of his balls against her thighs. She strained on tiptoe positioning herself to capture every inch. She thrust her hips back to take all of him inside not wanting to let go. Leonora was delirious in her pleasure, mixing the reality of her own office with this game she had been commanded to play. 

It seemed to run and run with smaller and smaller little spurts of semen escaping into her. At last he had no more to give. He noticed her tremors guessing she was experiencing an orgasm as vital as his own. 

On her knees she sucked him until he pushed her away. With her head down working away at him she could be mistaken for his self-important assistant. Always right, always efficient, always haughty yet so very desirable and unattainable. It was as though he had her at last. She was his slut now. 

One last play and he would be finished with her. "At the end of each day you will attend me here in my office. As you said yourself you are my hot slut now, to fuck whenever and however I want. Do you understand?" he smiled. 

"Yes sir. I am your hot slut ready to be fucked however and whenever you wish, sir," she said demurely with head bowed. 

The bun in her hair had unravelled to fall down her shoulders and he wondered how sexy his assistant would look; dishevelled after a good seeing to. He seriously considered sending his assistant to Jonathan on some pretext. If Jonathan could reduce her to such a debased state, as he had this poor creature, he would pay handsomely. 

"You are dismissed slut," he told her. 

On leaving the office Leonora forgot all about being an important business woman and sped back to her room to change. Once dressed in another outfit she went to seek out her master for further instructions. 

**** 

Sunday afternoon arrived with the chores of tidying up after the party completed. Jonathan once more took her to one side to reinforce the conditioning before sending her home. 

Leonora sat very still wondering what Jonathan was about to do. She was aware of her condition though thankfully unaware of the details. Partly from the hypnosis but also she couldn't bring herself to delve too deeply into her sordid behaviour. 

He had recognised she was resisting the hypnotic suggestion. Still under his influence she waited while he studied her trying to estimate how much control he still had. 

To keep her confidence and remain focused she reminded herself why she was fighting him. A shudder ran up her spine thinking how she had been trained to perform like a pet. 

Her mind and body had been twisted to satisfy a man, any man. The men he gave her to. As a party pet she would do whatever they asked, or else would volunteer to perform from a large list of tricks she had been taught by this dreadful man. 

She was almost free of him and steeled herself for the next move. That she was this aware meant she had a chance. 

*** 

In the aircraft she smiled to herself at having won her freedom. There were others caught in the same trap and as soon as she returned home she would help free them too. This vacation was desperately needed first. 

A few weeks had been accrued and her boss had agreed to give her time off. After all it was a quiet time of the year and her secretary could fill in for her. She smiled to herself with a pleasurable feeling of being free; free of that monster and free of the pressures of work. 

The tedious airport arrival procedures had been endured and the baggage retrieved. Seeing her name on a large piece of card was a surprise at first but the man smiled and took a hold of the luggage. He didn't speak English but it was obvious she just needed to follow him. 

He guided her through the crowd of families re-uniting and tourists looking lost. A rear door was opened and she found herself climbing into an elegant Mercedes Benz. 

Settling into the soft leather Leonora enjoyed the ride in a beautiful vintage motorcar seeing the sights of Istanbul. They arrived in a small courtyard by turning off a side street somewhere in the busy city. A nice relaxed feeling washed over her at the sight of the old fashioned elegant building. 

She congratulated herself on finding such a splendid hideaway on the internet. She watched the chauffeur walk around the car to open a door and offer his arm as support. 

She felt like a grand lady returning home after an evening at the opera. Flouncing up the ornate staircase curving around a large atrium she smiled with pleasure at the opulence of the decoration. She gave no thought as to why she didn't need to check in. It seemed the natural thing for this flunky to fetch her and carry the bags. 

It was hot in her room where a large slow fan merely pushed the exhausted air around. She changed from the crumpled travel clothes with a mental note to arrange for them to be laundered. In the wardrobe she found a caftan and pulled it on. Giving a twirl she smiled thinking it was most appropriate here and already felt cooler. 

A knock at the door surprised her. The man had returned beckoning for her to follow. It seemed the check-in routine had caught up with her. Leonora had always been one for rules and procedures and almost laughed at their laxity here. 

They a paused at a set of impressive ornately carved double doors and he knocked. She heard a heavy masculine voice say, "Enter." The flunky opened the doors stepping back for her to enter a glittering opulent room. 

The voice sounded rich and deep toned from a man she imagined to be large in stature as well as in personality. She had paused at the door when he again told her, "Enter," beckoning her forward with a hand stroking the warm night air. 

This was not a check in desk or managers office. Hesitantly moving forward she regretted not changing into something more substantial despite the heat. If this was to be a tedious meet and greet she would make excuses and get back to her room for a much needed rest. 

"Why are you here?" he asked. 

He interrupted her thoughts, which again broke up before she could concentrate properly on what was happening. It was difficult to concentrate in this heat and she really did need to rest after the flight. It was difficult to understand what he meant. 

She heard her voice answer as though it were someone else's. The words formed on her lips to flow as though taking on a life of their own, "I am here as your slave, my Lord." 

The words brought a sudden clarity of thought, as distinct as her voice had been. A chill of fear ran through her body. 

"Listen carefully to what I have to say. You are here to stay, it will be forever. There will be no turning back. Do you understand?" he asked. 

He looked at her so intently she felt frozen; it seemed she would not be able to answer, yet eventually words again sounded in her ears like those of a stranger. 

"I am here as your slave, my Lord. I shall obey your every command." She looked down at the floor before his feet. This was a familiar game played occasionally over the last few months. 

"Have you learnt to please a man?" this was not so much a question but sounded like a statement needing a response. 

"Yes, Master. I have studied hard to learn everything a man could possibly want. I will learn to use those skills for your absolute pleasure, Master. I have toned and shaped my body for you, my master." Leonora cooed. Her voice had a breathy lightness of enthusiasm and the feeling was catching a hold of her mind too. 

Stepping out of the caftan she stood naked before the powerful man she willingly called master. He stood before her treading heavily on the garment that had been her only protection. She dropped her gaze to the floor in a show of subservience. 

This must be a dream. It was a re-surfacing of memories from when she was a party girl. She felt hot and aroused by his presence. Perhaps too this was a way of coming to terms with what had happened to her. 

A strong hand guided her down onto her knees and she automatically opened her mouth. A terrible thought surfaced that this automatic reaction, to submit and to become so aroused, would last for some time. Perhaps this was a warning form her subconscious to avoid situations that might bring on such a vulnerable state. 

He lifted the long dark hair from around her neck and she wondered what he was doing. She knelt unresisting as he fitted a collar around her neck. Feeling the simple steel band snap into place she felt it was a potent and crushing token of ownership. 

Bringing her breathing under control she managed to stem the panic. She told herself this was just a dream. There was no need to fight it but rather it would be better to learn from the experience. 

A moment passed and she began to feel it was good to be owned, to belong somewhere, to have someone want her this much. She needed a break from responsibility so letting someone else make the decisions and take care of her felt good. 

With little ceremony he lifted her head where his cock was already standing ready. It was in her face dominating her. Without hesitation she licked its length down to his balls then after a moment of attention, her lips greedily licked up its full length to suck on its swollen head. Sensing he was more than ready she swallowed it whole. 

Working it hard she brought all the experience learnt over the last six months into practise. 

On her knees she waited for him to recover from an orgasm that she had so expertly brought him to. When she had his attention she opened her mouth to show his seed had not been summarily dismissed. He nodded for her to swallow, which she did and enjoyed the feeling it sliding down her throat.

*** 

Still in a daze she let the old man lead her back to the room. He handed her an envelope. She sat on a comfortable chair looking the tray of food. She didn't feel hungry but knew it would help. Propping up the envelope she stared at it while chewing on a fresh date and poured a cup of thick dark coffee. A glass of ice water scented with lemon juice was welcome too. 

Tearing a strip from the top of the envelope she looked at the signature to see it was from Jonathan. 

'By now you have been introduced to your new master. You can understand I had to do something before our game was spoilt by your determination to break free. An offer was made that I couldn't refuse and as you have found out, neither can you. 

A replacement for you has already been found, referred by a hypnotherapist friend of mine. Your secretary Eileen doesn't have the same poise and charm but will do as a simple party pet. She was under training before you left so will soon be working hard at our parties. 

Your master paid a large price for you so serve him well, little pet. If he grows tired of your services you may be sold on, maybe to a more challenging master, so learn how to please him.' 

Leonora gasped out loud. Poor Eileen! Her secretary would be doing... Memories came flooding back into her consciousness. The parties, the men, the depraved games, they swamped her mind. 

She lay back on the bed madly fingering her pussy and pinching a nipple with a free hand. An orgasm struck with maddening ferocity without sating the lust. It started all over again culminating in a less intense orgasm, only to continue on and on. Eventually she fell asleep exhausted. 

Waking in the early hours of the morning to the sound of cicadas' chirping Leonora lay thinking, trying to make sense of what had happened. It was obvious Jonathan had tricked her into thinking she was free after arranging to sell her as a slave to this man. 

With the return of those dreadful memories this was a better alternative. She dare not count up how many men she had served whereas now she had just one master to please. 

Tears ran down her cheeks knowing what Eileen would be compelled to do. Jonathan just had to tell her this knowing it would hurt. It also revealed how he had found out about her rebellion for Eileen had given her the telephone number of Jonathan's friend. He must have been preparing her for Jonathan. 

So what was to happen now? The training was certainly effective. Without a doubt she would obey any order given by this man, who considered her his property not just a plaything for the weekend. 

"Damn!" she exclaimed. She couldn't help thinking of him as her master and every time she did a naughty squishy feeling started between the legs. 

That first submission to him had been programmed into her mind like every lewd act committed during the last six months. Only then she had given up just two nights a week to become a hypnotised plaything during their special parties. The rest of the week she had been left free. 

Now she would be obeying orders twenty-four hours a day, everyday. Every time she obeyed her master it would reinforce her position as a sex slave. 

There would be no second chance at escape as everyday she would be tied in to this life by an ever tightening straight jacket. It was a cruel joke that this time she would remain aware of what was happening to her. 

When those memories hit last night she reacted to them as trained, as a hot slut needing a cock. They called her a party pet but she had been programmed into being a hot slut compelled to please a man. 

There had been no need to warn her to please her master for there was no choice. She was no longer a weekend pet she was a twenty-four-seven sex slave, forever. So this was it, from now on she would be a master's sex slave compelled to pleasure him. 

Leonora groaned in anguish realising she was playing with her swollen bud. The desire to please her master was strong even without his presence. It tormented her to realise she was enthusiastically looking forward to learning his needs and couldn't wait for morning.

Leonora 3 

Life as a slave begins 

Leonora awoke early in the morning with a faint hope it had all been a dream and she was at last to start the vacation she badly needed. She looked across the room at the dawn's tentative rays pushing out the shadows to see this was no hotel room. There were bars across the window. 

The shadow bars pinned her to the bed more forcibly than chains. Calmly she thought through what had happened and knew there would be no escape. Colleagues were hardly likely to miss her and after awhile would forget all about her. It hadn't been a request for a vacation, she thought was sent, but a resignation letter. 

She had drifted out of contact with friends in her home town so there would be little thought about where she had disappeared to. As an only child there were no close relatives either. 

Her secretary Eileen was a good friend and would be the only one to miss her. Unfortunately for both of them Eileen had been visiting the same hypnotherapist and was on the same road as she had travelled. It was more like a sewer than a road. Eileen had probably already been ordered to forget her. 

The therapist Eileen put her in contact with was the same one she had used six months ago to help lose weight. Ordered to forget he existed she had visited him again thinking he would help set her free from the ordeal. She felt so stupid to have fallen into their trap. 

Ironically the dieting at least had been successful. Her figure was ideal. Unfortunately it had been achieved to please men not her. She remembered performing exercises at home to strengthen inner muscles and cringed. Her breasts were large and natural over a slender waist. Her legs were slim and shapely; not too muscular as they had arranged just the right exercises. 

So there was no-one she could rely on for rescue. This was her life now and it would have to be endured. What was so cruel was that bastard Jonathan had opened up the memories of all those terrible acts of debauchery she had performed over the last six months. 

The memory of what they were doing to her had been safely tucked away while she was working. It was a diabolical arrangement. She supported herself with a job while being available to them whenever they called. 

It didn't seem quite as terrible as it should and wondered if that was a part of the conditioning, or training as he called it. Some of the games she had played were just naughty and even now thinking about them it began to arouse her. 

She cut off the lewd memories not wanting to endure it. Perhaps performing for her master she might recall them to help her please him. "No!" she moaned out load. How could she think like that? 

It would be necessary though. To prevent him selling her on to someone who might abuse her badly, it would be necessary to please her new master. "Well, I've learnt a few tricks. I've been trained to please a man so that shouldn't be a problem," she said quietly with a tinge of anger in her voice. 

Deciding to treat it like a management problem she moved on to thinking about escaping. The first thing to do was explore how tightly the damned hypnosis had her trapped. There must be loopholes in the command structure! 

A knock at the door interrupted the thoughtful planning and she pulled up the sheet to cover her naked body. 

The old servant put his head around the door and told her, "Get dress, master wants you." 

He spoke English after all, though haltingly and with a thick Arabic accent. She pulled on the caftan and found him waiting outside. She took a deep breath and followed. 

The fabric of the house was richly carved wood with intricate eastern patterns. In alcoves stood ancient artefacts, mostly vases with the occasional animal figurine in bronze or clay. 

From her room she walked along a balcony with finely pierced shutters overlooking a courtyard. With no time to stop she heard a tinkling fountain the only clue as to what might be glimpsed from her prison. 

A gentle knock at the seven foot double doors brought forth one word. "Enter," her master commanded. 

Timidly she walked on bare feet over richly patterned Persian carpets. In the large room it took what seemed an agonising age to reach him where she prostrated herself. The caftan split over her back revealing her bare bottom. She knew this from the feel of a cool breeze off the courtyard. 

There was no hum of air conditioning to disturb the silence except an ancient fan high in the ceiling that occasionally groaned a protest. "Stand up," he commanded. "Drop that," he said, pointing to the caftan. 

He sat in the same large wicker chair padded with cushions but now she was calmer she managed to catch sight of him from the corner of her eye. 

He was thin but not ancient like the servant. She guessed he was in his late thirties, with a pale skin and somewhat handsome. He was looking her over as though he too had been too excited to asses her properly last night. She stole glances in his direction, whereas he was blatantly staring at her naked body. 

The cooling breeze was refreshing but his examination was heating her up. He knew she was stealing a look at him but ignored the slave's breach of protocol. He crooked a finger drawing her forward. With a hand on her head he guided her to his lap while pulling his robes apart to reveal a hardening penis. 

Leonora knew what her position was in this relationship. As a sex slave she had no option but to lean forward with mouth open and kissed the end of his cock. Forming an O with her lips she sucked gently. She would have to learn his requirements so took it slowly. 

*** 

She had played this game before in a room decorated as an Eastern harem at Jonathan's mansion. Two other women had been with her dressed as harem girls with diaphanous tops and pantaloons split for easy access to their sex. 

They had giggled and cavorted like silly little slave girls. Being older mature women it would have been deeply humiliating for them to be aware of how foolishly and lewdly they were behaving. 

The three of them had been chased and caught to be tickled and eventually made to submit. All three had taken turns in being taken by the stranger. The young man had made them grovel at his feet making them admit to being his sex slaves. 

Leonora remembered telling him in detail how her body was available to be used by her master. The two others grovelled at is feet demeaning themselves with the same terrible details. Remembering the look in their eyes left her feeling sorry for them bringing a determination to free them if she could. 

*** 

All along she mechanically worked upon his cock until seeing his hands tighten on the arms of the chair. She looked up at him through long eyelashes. His eyes were tightly shut; he was ready. 

Leonora was about to serve her purpose so speeded up the bobbing of her head swallowing the thick head of his penis down her throat, feeling the first spasm of an orgasm. He pumped sperm into her mouth but despite the bitter taste she couldn't swallow, or heinous of crimes, spit. 

She rocked back on her heels spreading her legs to present her sex to her master. With hands on knees, steadying the precarious pose, she arched her back pushing out her breasts. Opening her mouth she balanced his sperm on her tongue hoping it wouldn't take long for him to recover. 

Her tongue ached from working hard on his cock and she needed to pull it in, but not until given permission. Her legs ached in this uncomfortably vulgar pose so it seemed an age before he cleared his throat. 

"Swallow," he told her. 

Having served his purpose she was summarily dismissed back to the room. Falling down upon the bed she gritted her teeth in anger and frustration. Would he never use her properly? She had been trained to respond to stimulation and felt frustrated from not having had him inside her where she needed it. 

"Slave needs master to fuck slave's cunt," she moaned into the pillow. It was an agony knowing she could never tell him what she wanted. All that was permitted was to look with pleading eyes hoping he would recognise the signal that she wanted to speak. 

What if he never gave permission, and if he did, would she be able to plead for his cock? The frustration would grow until she would willingly grovel at his feet, begging him to fuck her. The thought was terrible; it was so demeaning she shuddered. Which was worse though, being in a state of arousal so bad it hurt, or grovelling at his feet? 

*** 

The first week had passed slowly with little to do. There had been no conversation except the occasional command from her master which she dutifully obeyed. Leonora hadn't given up thinking of escape but hope was diminishing fast. 

During the second week he took her to his bed and made love to her. The feeling of satisfaction had been fleeting for he didn't know what she needed, or even cared to ask. It was comforting though, to have his arms around her for a moment, before being sent back to her room. 

During the fourth week he began to explore her body more thoroughly and took the trouble to discover how she responded to his touch. The satisfaction for her was still just an animal lust, short lived, but at least she had an orgasm. 

Summoned to his room she dutifully stood with head bowed awaiting his command. Climbing onto the bed she lay between his legs ready to satisfy him. 

"What is it you like my pet," he asked. 

It was clear what he meant and she couldn't avoid breathing a sigh of relief. "Slave likes her breasts stroked and sucked, master," she sighed. The anticipation heated her, or perhaps it was the embarrassment of revealing such intimate details. 

She even guided him to the right place between her legs and the rhythm she needed. It was enjoyable but still a mechanical thing, nothing like new lovers playing. 

That night she fell asleep in his arms. In the morning she felt a stirring of emotion for him as he looked so serene and peaceful in sleep. His eyes fluttered and opened but she forgot to look away. He smiled at her showing such warmth she responded as a woman not as a slave. 

Leonora had been a sex slave for six weeks and was settling in to a routine. It no longer seemed a terrible ordeal and she wondered if this was the conditioning or had she just given in. Maybe she genuinely enjoyed being his slave. 

*** 

The evening had been pleasant enough. She served her master as usual and now sat at his feet while he read. "I can't read this," he complained, with exasperation sounding clear in his voice. 

Leonora wondered if she had displeased him in some way. 

"I am bored with a compliant woman," he started but couldn't continue. 

She wanted to cry. Inside she pleaded fearfully not to be sent away. A little sob unavoidably escaped her lips. 

He leaned back in the chair looking down at her. "You are a beautiful woman and I thought that would be enough. It was supposed to be an ideal arrangement, uncomplicated by the confusion of a relationship. Now I know it is wrong." He told her. 

She looked up at him briefly with a pleading look in her eyes, needing to speak. It was no longer the fear of being sent away to a cruel master but something much more. She needed to stay with him she wanted him to be her master. It no longer mattered if this were the conditioning she felt it deeply. 

"I have arranged for a friend look at you," he told her. 

'No! Please master, don't send me away,' she cried inside. It didn't matter what this stranger was like he could never be her master, never. 

"He is an accomplished hypnotist. I have asked him to examine you to see if this hypnotic state can be removed. What do you say my pet?" he asked. 

Her heart raced, pounding in her chest. Her master wasn't tired of her, he still wanted her! He was thinking of her wellbeing as a responsible master should. She smiled beautifully at him, glowing with pride. "Thank you master, whatever you wish, your every command is your slaves' honeyed desire," she responded. 

A cloud scudded across her face marring the look of happiness. "What is it my pet?" 

"Master, your slave is afraid," she answered. 

"Tell me," he simply stated. 

"You are my master and this is enough for your slave. To change this might spoil," Leonora chocked unable to continue. She lowered her head, no longer able to keep the emotions in check. What if she could no longer serve him, what if he no longer wanted her once he met the real Leonora? 

"Your master understands. You will be free to decide and fate must take its course," he said, with a shrug of his shoulders. It did not indicate a casual indifference for he too was concerned. 

"I am willing to take the chance. I shall work hard to make you love me, to keep you at my side. Whether you stay must be your choice! That matters to me so much, it must be resolved," he said emphatically. 

The emotion in his voice was so strong she could not argue against the decision even if it were permitted. Given a choice she would not go through with such a risky undertaking. Everything they had built together could crumble into the sand, losing everything among the debris of time. 

*** 

Leonora was summoned from her room. She wore the same clothes, a simple loose shift and wore the same demeanour of servility. Without being told she walked to him and sat at his feet. 

He couldn't see her face but had been told the deep hypnotic influence was now removed. Did she hate him for what he had done to her? Was this a ruse to make the confrontation all the more hurtful? 

Despite the uncertainty he declared his feelings hoping not to have his desires shattered. "I love you Leonora, with all my heart," he told her. 

The whispered words were new but she had known them in her heart. She had hoped his feelings for her had not been imagined. More than that she hoped the relationship could survive this drastic change. 

She looked up at him with a beatific smile and with tears of joy in her eyes. "You are my master and your slave loves her master with all her heart," she said with a tremulous voice. 

He slid from the chair and picked her up and she wrapped her arms about his neck. He carried her to his room to gently lay her upon the bed. He looked at her with an intensity she hadn't seen before. Her breathing was ragged pulling in deep breaths. 

She felt she might drown in emotion. "I want you! Master, please, I am yours, take me!" Report_Story
