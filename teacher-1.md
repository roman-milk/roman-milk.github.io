Teacher

This first chapter is not so exhibitionist as the second chapter – it was just difficult to know which category to place it in. 

 

 

 Denis was on the way to class when he stopped to answer his phone. He was surprised to hear a teacher sounding nervous and angry. 

 "Denis I need your help," Miss Andrews blurted out in one long string of sound. 

 "Yea, sure. What can I do for you Miss Andrews," he said. 

 "Just turn around and you'll see my car. It's the blue Ford parked two rows back." 

 "Yea I see it. Do you want me to fetch something for you?" Denis asked, casually. 

 "Just do as I say, OK!" Carol told him, sounding cross. 

 "Is this a joke or something?" he asked, wondering if it was a friend imitating her voice. He looked around expecting to see the guys setting up some lame joke. Maybe they had written something on her car and were trapping him into taking the fall. 

 "Just walk over to the car," she ordered. Trying to regain some control she relaxed a fraction seeing him comply. 

 "When you get here just get in to the driving seat. You can drive can't you?" she asked, worried she had picked the one eighteen year old in college that couldn't. 

 "Of course I can! What's this is all about? Where are you?" He was feeling nervous at the tense tone of voice, it didn't sound like the usual confident teacher he knew in class. He hesitantly stepped in the right direction, though becoming more convinced it was some kind of lame trick. 

 He was right by the car so she tried to calm her voice so as not to spook him. She just hoped he wouldn't look in or attract attention if he saw her on the back seat. 

 "Please Denis, just get in. It's OK nothing's going to happen, I just need you to drive the car somewhere," she pleaded. She was conscious of her voice changing from commanding to pleading but couldn't help it. 

 He opened the door allowing in the sounds of noisy students reluctantly moving toward class and cars cruising looking for a space. 

 "You don't need the phone now I'm in the back here. No! Don't look, just start the car and drive," she told him. 

 Denis stared at his teacher lying on the back seat in her bra and panties. Hell! He hadn't seen a woman up close like this and for it to be her was some image to get used to. He couldn't help staring. 

 "Denis! Denis! Just drive, please." Carol said, with an urgent pleading voice. 

 "I've got a class in ten minutes miss," he said, trying to crawl back to reality. 

 "You can cut class this morning. Just drive, damn it!" Carol hissed urgently. 

 In the mirror she could see the campus patrolman walking along a line of cars inspecting passes, getting closer. The very person she didn't want to see right now. She could take the creeps innuendo's and smirks most times but right now she dare not think what he would say; more importantly what he would tell others. 

 Some story would make the rounds becoming more exaggerated in the telling until the principle heard a garbled tale. She would have to explain why she was half naked in her car with a student. Old people sensibly kept a rug in the back of the car which right now seemed such a wonderful idea. 

 "Just drive, get me out of here," she pleaded with him. 

 Denis concentrated on driving the unfamiliar car through the car park onto the main road. He angled the mirror to get a better look making sure she was really there. Miss Andrews was a beautiful blonde that any young man would kill to have naked on the back seat of their car. 

 It wasn't his car and she wasn't completely naked but any man would revel in such a sight. 

 "Concentrate on the road, Kevin," she told him. 

 "Where to?" he asked. 

 "Home, get me home, please, quickly," she urged him on feeling an urgent need to pee. Her tone was taking on a higher more desperate pitch too. 

 "What happened? Was it a dare?" he asked. 

 "No. Just a stupid day," she sighed. "I was up late last night and was late this morning, rushing to class. I slammed the car door on my dress. In a temper I tore it free and there I was standing in my underwear. I was fumbling with dress and purse getting the key when the damn dress blew under a car. I just leapt into the back seat before anyone saw me. I was terrified," she added. 

 Just thinking about it brought her out in a cold sweat. To calm herself she thought of being safely home. The first thing she would do is pee, refresh her makeup and get dressed. 

 At last they pulled up outside her home. She hadn't bothered telling him not to look in the mirror again for it seemed an impossible task not to. Just the once she had anxiously reminded him the lights had changed to red. 

 The house was so close yet so far away. A neighbour was out mowing an immaculate lawn. She dithered on making the decision to make a break for the front door. Wanting to pee and not wanting to be seen became an agonising moment. 

 "Get your key ready and make a break for it when he turns around," Denis suggested. 

 "The key! Damn it, it's in my purse in the car park. I dropped it when leaping into the car." 

 "I'll drive back and get it," he said, putting it into drive. 

 She watched her house and neighbour pass by with eyes peering just above the door panel. "No, not back there! Somewhere else," she said, her voice tailing off, wondering where to go. 

 "I could take you back to my place," Denis suggested. 

 Carol grimaced at the thought. An alternative hadn't occurred to her so she agreed. "OK. Slow down! I don't want to be caught like this by the cops." In the mirror Carol could see a big grin on his face. She grimaced again. 

 With a figure like hers she was used to being ogled by men but he was a student. At twenty nine with large breasts fending off men had become an art form. So this young guy wouldn't be much trouble. The trouble was, being driven further into a bad day that was becoming worse by the minute. 

 Racking her brains for an idea didn't help. She was stuck with him until either she had some clothes or she thought of an escape route. 

 She considered sending him into a store for clothes but her purse and credit cards had probably been handed in to lost property by now. He didn't look as if he had a bean in his pocket and thinking about the ghastly clothes he might bring back killed that idea. 

 At least this time there was no-one in sight. He led the way up to the front door with key in hand. Without fumbling the door was open and she was inside safe from the outside world. Still in a crouch trying to hide her nakedness she followed him to the stairs. A sudden burst of laughter was joined by others. Carol froze in fear with a foot on the first step. 

 "Quick, upstairs to my room," he whispered. Taking a hold of her hand he led her up two flights of stairs at a run to the attic rooms. 

 Safely in his room she breathed heavily from the panicky escape. "Who was that?" she gasped. 

 "The guys who share the place, I thought they would be in class," he shrugged. 

 Carol looked around the room. There were no sheets on the bed and only blinds up at the windows. "Do you have a towel or something?" she asked. Still holding herself defensively she looked around again, desperate for anything that might cover her embarrassment. 

 "It's Friday, nothing's back from the laundry," he shrugged. 

 It was a typical students' room though not as untidy as hers had been. It was larger too, running the whole length of the building under the roof so that the ceiling sloped along one edge. 

 "Do you mind not looking at me like that," she said. The look of a predatory wolf after prey came to mind. She couldn't blame him for a look anyone might give her in a nightclub and under these circumstances it was understandable, though more uncomfortable. 

 She was going to have to do the thinking for both of them "Do you have something for me to wear, please," she asked, trying not to sound too bossy or sarcastic. It was necessary to keep him sweet as she still needed his help to get out of this mess. 

 He produced a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. From where she stood it was obvious there was nothing else in the wardrobe. Why had she picked a damn minimalist? Struggling with them she found they wouldn't pull up over her bottom. "Damn! My ass is too big. My breasts are too much for that t-shirt," she said, thinking out loud. 

 "No. Your ass is nice. I think your," he began. 

 "Don't go there Denis. You are way out of your depth," she was thinking of married friends who teased their husbands asking what they looked like in a new dress. The sensible husbands declined to even look. 

 "A piece of advice about women is to leave their butt alone. It's not a safe route to take," Carol stated. 'Hell! Did I just say that?' 

 "I wasn't thinking of your ass like that Miss Andrews," he stammered. The look of apology on his face was amusing but she didn't notice while thinking of something more urgent. 

 The sexual tension was working on her too after the panic and excitement of running upstairs. The flight from danger of discovery had been exciting. He too was looking keyed up and the last thing she needed right now was an over excited young man. 

 "We need to think of a way out of this. Just take a deep breast, breath!" she quickly corrected herself. "Relax and breathe in." 

 Too late she realised the bra was too tight to be expanding her chest in front of a young inexperienced lad like this. With the intake of breath her fleshy white breasts overflowed the little cups almost bursting free. It was just making it worse for the poor fellow. 

 She plonked her body down on the edge of the bed and looked up at him. He was watching her breasts bounce. "Damn!" she complained. "Is there anyone out there, I need the bathroom." 

 With the door open a crack they froze on hearing a whistling grow nearer then a door slam. 

 "It's Blow. He'll be in there for ages," Denis explained. He rummaged around and found an empty bean can, held it up toward her, shook his head then threw it into the trash. 

 "Will this do?" he asked. 

 Carol looked at the old army helmet and gritted her teeth. "Needs must I suppose." 

 Without being told he turned around while she carefully balanced on the precarious potty with knickers around her ankles. It was difficult balancing but let it go, keeping it upright with her weight while leaning back against the bed. 

 Before she could relax the damn thing tipped and she landed on the floor with an exclamation not used in class. When he jumped round to help she swore again. 

 

 "I'll hold your shoulders," he said, trying to be helpful. 

 He was studiously looking across the room not down at her which was some small consolation. That she had been on her bare bottom with legs splayed either side of the damn helmet when he picked her up was highly embarrassing. She couldn't bring herself together enough to speak so gave in to the helpful suggestion. 

 He had a firm grip of her shoulders otherwise she might have shrugged him away. After an agony of waiting it hit the bottom of the helmet to make a terrible racket, swishing around, echoing loudly. This was such a bad day it just had to go on and on adding to the humiliation of a most humbling moment. 

 It didn't make it any easier that her face was inches from his crotch. It was no wonder he had a raging hard-on from what she had put him through. She felt sorry for him and herself too. If she hadn't panicked then maybe the damn dress wouldn't have been dropped and they wouldn't have been thrown together into this terrible situation. 

 Hurriedly pulling up the panties she wriggled into them while he held the improvised pot. Now his face was inches from her crotch, so close she could feel his breath over her thighs. 

 Plonking herself onto the edge of his bed she dropped her face to hide it in long blond hair. It was only a gesture but at least she had some privacy while trying to think. "This is terrible. What am I to do?" she moaned. 

 He moved back to her placing his hands on her shoulders. "It's OK! I'll get you something to wear so you can drive home. I'll find a way into your house and you can start the day afresh," he said, trying to mollify her. 

 The soothing concern in his voice was touching. If she had been in a bedroom with one of her friend's husbands she doubted sympathy would have entered the tone of conversation. 

 Right in front of her she could smell the scent of aroused male escaping from the tight jeans. He may be inexperienced but he was a man with a near naked woman in his bedroom. 

 "I've got to get out of here Denis. If I get caught like this, in a student's bedroom, I'd be dismissed. I wouldn't get another teaching job either," she sighed. A touch of desperation in her voice was picked up on. She could see it from the look on his face. 

 She was going to have to be careful. He must already be feeling feint from a lack of blood supply to his brain and his penis was probably starting to do the thinking for him. 

 Taking charge shouldn't be too difficult; after all he was her student. He stood there holding onto her shoulders looking down at her. It was probably the first time he had touched a woman dressed in underwear and a pair of sandals. Carol almost sobbed a laugh on thinking it was the sandals that did it every time. 

 "Sit down here Denis," she told him, patting the bed. "You're a nice boy," she said, emphasising the word boy. "It must be hard for you," she stopped on catching herself looking at his crotch. "You must try harder, I mean, try to get me out of this mess, please," her voice tailed off in confusion not knowing what to say. 

 "I will, Miss," he said. He put an arm around her shoulders. "You must do me a favour in return." 

 Before she could un-wrap his arm she froze. This is not what she wanted to hear. 

 "In class you give me a hard time, I know you're encouraging me, others have said as much," he began. 

 "I don't mean to!" she exclaimed. 'Damn!' She knew men looked at her like that but was so used to it she thought nothing of it. Surely he didn't think she encouraged the boys in class. What had she done? Was it the clothes she wore? What was the gossip if they were saying she had purposely made him hard in class? Had the gossip reached the other teachers? 

 "You do miss. I know it's for my own good but exams aren't the only thing in life," he said. 

 "Oh!" she said, feeling so very relieved. He was talking about being pushed to try harder. "You're right of course," Carol concluded in a sensible tone that belied the turmoil of emotion inside. 

 Jumping to such a silly conclusion made her wonder if she were being fired up from this stupid vulnerable position. He was a handsome young man so maybe he wasn't so interested in a woman her age. Whoever was being affected the most didn't matter, she must think of a way out of here and quick. 

 Catching her unawares he pulled her head onto his shoulder and wrapped both arms around her. He whispered something in her ear. The little tingling sensations whispered bliss straight to the pleasure centres of her brain. 

 Her ears had always been sensitive. Touching the backs of her knees did nothing for her. Stroking her thighs and even attention to her breasts could be resisted but breathing heavily into her ears did something. It was like being shot with a pleasure dart. 

 Sitting there in a state of acquiescence confirmed she must have been aroused all along otherwise she would be fighting him off. A part of her mind was telling her to give in, to give him what he wanted so she could get what she wanted – clothes! 

 It was just an excuse and she tried to convince the naughty self it was wrong but was failing dismally. She could hear her heavy breathing as though she had climbed another flight of stairs. 

 The excitement of danger from being discovered, the panicky flight up the stairs, had worked upon her emotions more than she realised. She was dependent upon this young man to get her out of here and that dependency was leaving her too compliant. 

 Denis had his teacher in his arms kissing her ears and neck. He had merely tried to reassure her by holding her tight and talking quietly. Feeling her press against him was an opportunity impossible to resist. He kissed her ear then followed her neck to her lips, kissing and caressing all the way. 

 When she opened her mouth he kissed her deeply. The last girlfriend had taught him well but he didn't think of her now, he was on automatic pilot following male instincts. 

 His hands pushed up the bra exposing a luscious pair of breasts for his fingers to explore. It was a rougher fumbling than it should have been but with their tongues entwined neither could ask nor give instructions. 

 So carried away Carol might have pulled the crotch of her panties to one side or it might have been him but at that moment she didn't care. It had been a long time since anyone had paid so much attention to her lips and neck and ears. 

 The sensations of pleasure were intense enough to break down the barrier between morals and desire. If the last boyfriend had been a better lover or if it hadn't been so long ago or Denis wasn't so strong and handsome then maybe she would have had a chance to resist. 

 On feeling a hardness press against an upper thigh alarm bells began to ring. An intruder alert was bringing her back to reality. "No. Stop!" Carol whispered hoarsely through gritted teeth. She couldn't fight him and herself. 'This is wrong, very wrong,' she thought, only half convinced. She hadn't even noticed they had fallen back across the bed. 

 He heard not a word as he manoeuvred over her. His lips found her nipples as he arched back sucking them away from her body thrusting forward with strong hips. 

 

 She felt a rod of iron entering her. It slid in leaving her feeling guilty at being so easy. It wasn't a coming together of two people in love or even the sad inevitability of a long term relationship. It wasn't her lover's cock it was just a hard shaft invading her body. 

 As she lay prone under him time seemed to stand still as the unwelcome thing penetrated deeper and deeper. 

 She sobbed from the indignity of being taken by this young man, her student. The frantic thrusts slowed and he began to tell her how wonderful she was. At first she felt even more disgusted for letting him do this to her. 

 They were the touching words of a young man in love. He was a virgin pouring his heart out to her. It should have been to a young girl his age and she began to feel privileged to be sharing his first time. 

 A slight shift in his weight changed the angle of his penis. It rubbed against her clit which brought a spasm of movement to her hips. 

 "Oh! Yes," he breathed out the words in obvious pleasure. 

 Carol lifted her hips in a gentle push to hear him utter some garbled gratitude. The accompanying squirm of his hips did something for her too. His movements were now hitting the right spot. 

 She began to thrust up with her hips, arching her back, listening to the murmurs of appreciation and feeling the enthusiastic response. It was irresistible. She began to take the initiative. The thought of fucking this young virgin began to build her to a climax. 

 She was ready for him. She needed him to cum. She desperately needed to feel him empty his seed into her. The sensation of fullness was no longer enough she needed to cum, now! 

 "Fuck me harder. Faster! Cum damn you!" she wailed. Her fists bounced off his hard flexing back. His strong legs pushed and heaved, pounding her hard. She felt as though he were about to pierce her entire body with the next thrust. 

 "I'm cumin!" he said quietly, as if she needed a warning. 

 "Oh! Yessss," she hissed. It felt as though he were filling her up with his thick potent juices. She imagined it filling her whole body. She felt as though she were nothing but his vessel of cum. She was a small thing in the universe completely given over to him.

She opened her eyes to see him watching her. The intensity of the stare was overpowering. 

 "I've been talking to you," he said. "I was worried I'd hurt you." 

 She felt like a teenager again. It was like her first time all over again. The moment didn't last long as the situation gradually bore down on her. She was about to tell him she wasn't on the pill but it would be pointless telling someone who hadn't had to face the realities of life yet. 

 She smiled at him not wanting to spoil the moment. "You had better stop that. It's too nice," she said, on becoming aware of his fingers gently stroking her thighs. The naughty fingers barely touched, skimming over the soft flesh causing goose bumps. 

 "Don't start something you can't finish," she teased. "Damn!" she exclaimed. She felt how ready he was and wondered what to do. She should be in class setting revision for him and the rest of his friends. Instead she was in his room fucking him. 

 She giggled and he quickly caught onto where to touch. She grabbed his wrist but couldn't pull his hand away. As they struggled across the bed he stripped her and tickled her. Helpless from laughter she felt him grab her wrists in one hand while he continued to work on her with the other. 

 "Stop it! I've got to go. Please! You are being naughty young man," she told him in a contrived stern voice. 

 "I think you have been the naughty one, teacher," he laughed. 

 At this reminder of responsibility she pulled her legs up to push him off the bed. Instead he rolled her over and held her down with the flat of his hand on her back. 

 "It's not too big at all," he told her. 

 She felt his hand massaging her bottom remembering trying to get into his jeans. At least he wasn't teasing her pussy. She began to enjoy this too as his hands travelled over her thighs and bottom, up her back. 

 "Such a naughty teacher!" he scolded her. 

 Before she could tell him not to call her that she felt a slap to her ass. "You can stop that right now!" she told him sternly. "Owww! Stop it!" It was only a gentle slap but it felt so wrong to be naked before a student being spanked. The whole sordid situation was closing in on her. 

 Carol felt so guilty from giving into her own wantonness. She wanted to curl up in a ball and hide while wishing nothing had happened but it wouldn't just go away. "I am naughty, I'm sorry," she apologised, suddenly feeling small and fragile. 

 "So you admit you're a naughty young woman," Kevin smiled. He took in the sight of his teaches naked body lying stretched out on his bed and just had to pinch the lovely soft ass. Her bottom quivered in such a tantalising way he had to stroke it, running a finger between her blushing cheeks. 

 "Now I've spanked the naughty young woman she had better say sorry; and call me sir," he added as an after thought. The delight at having turned the tables on his teacher was almost as thrilling as having fucked her. 

 "I'm sorry, Sir," she croaked. It wasn't a joke to her for she really meant it. Carol felt like a naughty little girl who had been very bad and felt very irresponsible. He was innocent and blameless leaving her feeling subdued and lowly. 

 She watched him dress. Pulling up his jeans she had a good look at his firm ass and felt guilty at the thrill of knowing this young man had fucked her but couldn't look away. She was hopelessly in lust over him. 

 "Where are you going?" she asked with concern. 

 "I'll see if Blow has something for you to wear," he said. 

 "No! Don't tell anyone I'm here, please! Where's my underwear?" she asked in fright. She curled up in a ball for protection from his lustful look feeling very vulnerable. 

 "I won't. I'll go into his room while he's out, won't be long. Don't move naughty girl, stay exactly as you are." He scooped the abandoned underwear off the floor and strode to the door. "I'll take these with me as I know how disobedient you are, naughty girl!" he laughed. 

 "Don't do that! Please! Please sir, can I have my panties back," she pleaded. She watched him with imploring eyes as he turned in the doorway to give her a broad grin. He had her where he wanted and wasn't going to let go easily. She imagined being trapped there all weekend pandering to his whims begging for clothes. 

 Her hand reached between her legs and she threw it back onto the bed. "Damn!" she exclaimed. Asking a student for her panties back had been so wicked it had been unexpectedly arousing. The idea of pandering to his needs had been so hot she didn't know what she was doing. 

 Who would be pandering to whose needs? Calming down she told herself he was getting some clothes, so the ordeal was nearly over. The damage recovery would start then for she couldn't let him brag to his friends. Appealing to him for protection would be a necessity and easy to do as she felt so vulnerable. 

 It took her by surprise when he burst in and bounded over to her crashing onto the bed. He scooped her up holding her in a tight embrace. "It was a good thing I knocked, he was in. They're all going out soon. I found out a girlfriend left some clothes behind so I'll grab them when he goes out," he told her. 

 "Where's my underwear?" she asked. "Stop that, please. Ouch! Not so hard," she yelped when he bit on a nipple. This would have to stop. She shouldn't have said that, it sounded as though she wanted him to continue more gently. It was probably because she wanted him to. 

 "Ask me nicely," he said. 

 "Please sir, can I have my panties back," she asked, sounding more pathetic than she had meant to. It was the effect of what he was doing to her body as well as the request sounding so naughty. His strong hands were everywhere and she gave up fending them off. 

 "I meant this," he said and nipped a nipple again. 

 "Ouch! Treat them gentle." Catching on to his game she tried again. "Please sir, kiss my nipples nicely," she moaned. It was too late to back away now even if she could escape his grasp. She was aroused and her body had decided to give in. 

 Carol moaned out loud feeling him enter. She was still wet from before and the foreplay together with her imagination and the naughty words had kept her going. "Slowly, not so fast, that's it," she tutored him. 

 He let her manoeuvre his hips with both hands gripping his cheeks. When she lifted her legs and wrapped them around his waist he nearly let go with an urgent need to cum. Still recovering from last time he was able to hold back. With more control this time he manoeuvred his cock finding the place where she moaned the most. 

 With a steady deep rhythm he thrust in enjoying with pride his teacher's groans ejected forcefully between pursed lips. He noticed the animal grunt when he moved in a certain way so continued thrusting at that angle. 

 She was no longer giving instructions being lost in a world of her own. It included nothing but the sensations driving her toward a climax of overpowering feelings. "I'm cumin," she gasped. Pinned to the bed, prone beneath him, she felt a hard deep thrust. 

 He held it there with his cock pumping a jet of sperm into her. It felt as though he were filling her up. She couldn't move, dare not, wanting to feel every tingling sensation radiating throughout her body. She was so deeply routed in the animal-self it felt as though his vital juices were in her blood pumping through her body, reaching into her brain, swamping her mind. 

 *** 

 Carol stroked his dark hair marvelling at how vital the orgasms had been with this young man, whishing they hadn't been. She hadn't known anything like it before and sadly wondered if she ever would again. 

 He was asleep cuddling her with a cheek on her breasts. She felt wonderful in the arms of her lover only it was a pupil and that was trouble. 

 The thought of being ridiculed in newspapers had been pushed back out of the way but she still had to face the problem of keeping all this quiet. Getting out of his room was the first priority. Patiently she waited, stroking his hair while he slept. 

 Occasionally he sucked on a nipple in his sleep and she smiled. Perhaps if she promised to do this in class at break time it might buy his silence. Holding back the giggle in case it woke him she tried to focus on something else.

Chapter 02 

 His teacher is humiliated 

 Miss Andrews felt him stirring from a deep sleep and gently eased his head from her breast onto the pillow. It was her turn to be looking at him when he opened his hazel eyes. There was a mix of disquiet and pleasant satisfaction on her face. 

 "I'm hungry," Denis announced. With a wicked grin on his face he pulled her close and sucked on her soft breast devouring it like a ravenous beast. She pushed with her legs trying to break free but he was ready and wrapped an arm round her calf pulling it up opening her legs. 

 "Stop it," she whimpered on feeling finger tips probing her lips. "Damn you, let me go," she complained. It was exciting fighting off an ardent young lover but he was her student. It was wrong so she couldn't let him take advantage again. It had been understandable the first time under these extraordinary circumstances but it must stop right now. 

 "Ask me to stop properly, naughty teacher," he laughed. 

 Locked in a vice like grip she would have to play by his rules. To avoid being seduced into a state of submission she was going to have to plead for mercy and quickly. "Please, sir, let me go," she whimpered, just as he found her bud. She would capitulate to those teasing fingers if she didn't stop him quickly. 

 "Teacher must try harder to express herself," he teased. 

 "Can my favourite student remove his fingers from teachers' pussy, please!" she said in a tremulous voice. This wasn't working for the statement was only adding to her arousal. She was naked on a student's bed begging him to stop fingering her knowing her resistance was fading fast. 

 "You had better do as I say or else," he grinned, and slapped her ass. 

 She knew it thrilled him to have his teacher at his mercy and so she would have to play along to get what she needed. Being left alone was the first priority then clothes. Carol felt desperate enough to run home naked. 

 "Please sir, I need clothes. Thank you, sir," she sighed when he let her go. Carol settled back on the bed letting him take charge for the moment while she struggled to regain some self control. Her legs were firmly pulled together under his disconcerting stare. 

 "Please, sir, can I have my panties back?" she said. They both broke into a fit of giggles breaking the intensity of the mood. Thank heavens he had been sated for she couldn't take much more. Making love had never been so exciting; it was a pity to give up such exciting sex but it could never happen again. 

 They heard the front door slam shut damping the sound of raucous young men leaving for an early Friday night out on the town. She looked at him with a meaningful request, her blue eyes wide with expectancy. 

 "I'll get you some clothes," he said. The simple statement made her heart race with a sense of freedom, of escape; the simplicity of being clothed had come to mean something special. The madness was about to end. 

 He returned with a cardboard box of feminine clothing when she thought he would bring back a pair of jeans and t-shirt from a larger built friend. The sense of excitement was funny and she laughed out loud. 

 "Where's my underwear?" she asked. 

 "I chucked them in the bathroom on the way to his room earlier. They've gone," he said with a shrug of his shoulders. 

 Dismissing what she thought was a ruse she sorted through the pile of clothes. She held them up then discarded each garment in turn. She leaped up off the bed to hold a skirt before her. "She's shorter than me and slimmer," Carol stated. 

 She clipped in place the wraparound skirt only just managing to fasten it around her waist. With a sense of pleasure that she could get into a young woman's clothes she grabbed a top from the bed. It wouldn't button up over her large breasts so grabbed a stretchy boob tube. 

 He watched her stripping in reverse, yet it seemed all the more sexy. Watching his teacher dressing in the clothes he had brought her gave him a feeling of power over this woman of authority. It was fascinating watching the way she pulled at the clothes trying to make them fit over her luscious body. 

 Carol didn't need a mirror to see how awful she looked. A glance in his direction was no help for the look of lust emphasised what she felt. "Don't you ever look in the mirror? Not even in the mornings? Is there a mirror in the bathroom?" she asked. 

 "Make sure there's no-one around!" she said. 

 The bathroom mirror confirmed what she already knew. She looked like a slut. 'I behaved like one now I look like one,' she wailed inside. "This is almost worse than being caught in my underwear," she complained. Looking around the bathroom confirmed what he said, her underwear had gone. 

 "You look great!" he told her. 

 Dismissing his opinion she marched upstairs to sort through the underwear. It was at least clean. Nothing seemed substantial enough to wear under the little skirt but pulled on a thong grateful to have her pussy safely tucked away. 

 The friends' ex-girlfriend obviously didn't need a bra as the tightness of the boob tube testified to her having small breasts. At least it held her in place though running would be out of the question and even a fast walk would have them bouncing around. 

 "You look fantastic." he encouraged, trying to cheer her up. 

 "It's more traditional to bring your teacher an apple." She looked down at her large breasts stretching the boob tube to bursting point. She told him, "It would be a good idea to stick to tradition in future." 

 She looked and felt like a dumb blonde, exactly the image she had always avoided. Her confidence on facing the world was far smaller than just one of those mounds presented in such a vulgar display. 

 He took her hands in his kissing them tenderly. She couldn't be annoyed with him for her own silly mistake. He took out a pair of expensive sunglass from a back pocket and perched them on her nose. 

 "A disguise," he announced. 

 She laughed and reached up to kiss his lips. He took her into his arms and forced her to take his tongue in an unexpected deep kiss. It took her breath away and lightened her mood. 'Nearly home,' she told herself, trying desperately to remain focused. 

 She looked at him over the rim of the sunglasses to tell him, "Now be a good boy and run your teacher home. No more sex education you've learnt enough," she said with a mock sternness. 

 "Marks out of ten?" he teased back. 

 "A plus, well done young man," she congratulated him. 

 He watched her trying to pull an extra inch or two from the short skirt and failing as he followed her out to the stairs. He grabbed a handful of bum under the skirt and she hissed at him. 

 "Go look to make sure they've gone." She stood a moment pulling the skirt into place then followed. 

 He looked up the stairs for a flash of white panties under the flared navy skirt bouncing up with every step. 

 "Wipe that silly grin and start the car. Wait! Give me a sign if its all clear." She stood at the door looking up and down the street and soon as the engine revved - why did men have to do that -- ran to the back door and dived in. 

 "Get me safely home Denis, please," she pleaded. This time she studied him in the mirror while he hummed to himself obviously feeling very pleased. She would have to invite him in and talk him back to reality. No more fooling around. They would have to return to the proper relationship between teacher and student.

 "It's no good. Everywhere is locked up tight," he told her. 

 "Did you try the kitchen window, I sometimes leave it open to get rid of cooking smells," she asked. The sincere look of concern told her he had tried hard to get in; almost as hard as he had been getting into her. 

 "Better drive and park up somewhere, one of the neighbours might come over to find out what's going on," she told him. There was a slight excitement to planning breaking in even though it was her house. They felt like Bonny and Clyde. 

 "If we smash a window the alarm will go off and attract attention. I know a guy who can get in without breaking anything or making a sound," Denis told her. 

 "Desperation calls for desperate methods," she intoned and imitated one of his shrugs. 

 *** 

 They pulled up in a seedy looking area of town. "You had better not stay out here. There's no-one you'd know around here so it'll be OK." he reassured her. 

 Carol reluctantly got out of the car feeling a little better when he gripped her hand tight. She felt like a little girl afraid of the dark with a big brave man taking care of her. While trying to shrug off the feeling they turned a corner onto a brightly lit street where her confidence evaporated. 

 "I'm not sure about this," she demurred holding him back. 

 "Its alright, everyone will assume your my girlfriend. You look young enough and you certainly don't look like a teacher," he told her. 

 She had to agree about not looking like a teacher. She looked like some dumb bimbo and was feeling like one having let all this get so badly out of hand. There was no going back now; he had the car keys and she had lost track of where the car was parked. 

 No-one pointed an accusing finger at her and they were soon at what seemed to be their destination. Outside the club a couple of Hispanic guys gave her the once over slowly while continuing their conversation in a halting staccato of sounds. A huge slab of a man wearing a dark suit stood in their way. 

 "She old enough?" he demanded. 

 "Yea, she's mine, she's cool," Denis said, with nervous tension clearly in his voice. 

 A large hand gripped her chin taking a closer look at her face. "No Id, no drinking," the big man warned her and stepped aside. 

 She felt even more like a damned teenager being taken out by a boyfriend. She trailed along behind him into the club. 

 In the hot dark cavern of sound there was little chance her mother would recognise her let alone a student and if there was a fellow teacher here they wouldn't want to. She giggled like a schoolgirl and shouted at Denis, "Don't I look over twenty-one," imitating of one of her least bright pupils. 

 He leaned back looking her up and down. "Funny, you don't. It's your smooth skin and you have a kind of impish look. The sexy outfit distracts from anyone looking at you properly. Just don't go ordering some sophisticated cocktail. Keep close." 

 She didn't need telling. Through the close packed crowd of rowdy young people she was pulled, feeling lightheaded at getting away with the subterfuge. No-one took any notice of the teacher infiltrating the fun so her confidence started to recover. 

 It was off-putting squeezing between them, having to rub her breasts against hard young fit men. One or two turned to face her taking a good look at the bulging tits rubbing their chests. From embarrassment she wanted to apologise for them being in the way but after awhile it became a part of the game. 

 Being dragged through the crowd of moving bodies was exciting. The unfamiliar steady beat of the music vibrating her ribs was unsettling and exhilarating. She felt drunk from the battering of sound and flashing lights to which bodies gyrated in unison. Responsibilities of adulthood lifted from her shoulders leaving her feeling like a teenager again 

 When a girl sneered at her and pulled on her boyfriends arm she was thankful not to hear what was said. If she had been at a friends party dressed like this a drunken husband would have been sure to goose her yet here, surprisingly, they left her alone. 

 Though not entirely. The young men looked at her with obvious lust. They hadn't a clue she was a teacher flaunting a bare midriff with lots of thigh and breasts bouncing around. The headiness of the moment had got to her and she was flirting right back at them. They saw her looking like a dumb slut on the prowl and wanted some. It was a heady thought bringing on a familiar naughty feeling. 

 At last the search seemed completed as they turned out of the main hall into a quieter room. The thump of sound was felt through the wall but at least she was regaining some hearing. 

 "Hey Joe, thought I'd find you here," Denis said with relief. 

 "What you up to, haven't seen you around," the young man said, not wanting an answer. He was as tall as Denis looking as though he needed a good meal. His hair was gelled back, stuck to his scalp. 

 "Who's the tits, yours?" he grinned. 

 Without missing a beat Denis replied, "Cindy, she belongs to me." 

 Carol was glad he hadn't revealed her name, more so than being insulted by the arrogant young man. There was a Cindy in her class, a blonde manipulative bitch, so she was a bit miffed that Denis had picked the name so readily. 

 Denis stood solidly whereas Joe seemed to vibrate on the spot with barely restrained energy. He opened his arms out to her in a greeting but not the kind of welcome she liked the look of. 

 "Give him a squeeze," Denis prompted with a whisper. 

 If this was a ritual they had then she had to carry it out for this was the young man who would get her back safely inside her home. She took a step closer and held onto him as though her were a dead rat for a brief hug. 

 He wrapped both arms around her grabbing some bare ass and squeezed holding on tight. She felt his hardness against her belly and felt terribly vulnerable. She almost kicked out at him but restrained the impulse. 

 He let her go and she turned to Denis looking to see if this was usual. He didn't like it but sensibly kept his mouth shut. 

 "Nice ass your Cindy doll has," Joe told him. 

 She quickly pulled the back of the skirt into place from being crumpled up. She looked crossly at him letting him know she hadn't enjoyed being touched so intimately. It was a damn degrading experience. 

 Not once had he spoken to her, treating her like Denis' dumb pet. Well, she was dressed like a dumb blonde so what could she expect. All she could do was follow Denis's example, keep her mouth shut and endure it. She held on to the thought of him getting into her house and putting an end to this dreadful day. 

 "So long as the doll's parents are away it won't be a problem. I'll get the gear," Joe said. 

 Again on the back seat she scrunched down not wanting to be seen the way she was dressed. She was being ignored but didn't mind at all. Realising they weren't on the way home she started listening to their conversation. 

 "Just a couple of stops along the way and I'll do you a favour in return. It's handy for me you turned up, my vans in the shop," Joe said. 

 "Here, this is it. Come in you might meet some useful contacts," Joe enthused. 

 Trailing behind them reluctantly into a pool hall she wondered if this was a punishment for her misbehaviour earlier. The men were around her age but that only made her feel less confident and uncomfortable from the way she was dressed. 

 The men ignored the three of them as though they were insignificant kids. Their conversation was course and Carol felt like telling them there was a lady present but under the circumstances she preferred to be ignored. 

 "You here to pay up, Joey boy?" Freddy asked. He leant on a pool stick looking mean. 

 "I'm going to but need some stuff. I'll sell it and come back straight away. I'm a good customer Freddy," he said. 

 "A good customer? A good customer pays," the hard-man told him with a warning glare. 

 "I'm doing my friend a favour and he's going to pay so I'll be right back and pay you, OK?" Joe told him, looking nervous. He seemed to be hoping from foot to foot only his feet never left the ground. 

 "Stop your dancing Joey, your putting me off my game. So what's this big favour that's going to pay off your debts," he demanded. 

 "I'm going to break in to her parent's house, she's lost her key," Joe said, with less enthusiasm now the trivial fact was out. 

 'Damn, don't involve me you little shit!' Carol thought. What ever in hell he was involved in with these dangerous looking people she just didn't want to know about. Keeping her head down she hoped they would leave her out of it. 

 "It's not much but when I sell the stuff you give me I'll pay almost all I owe you," Joe pleaded. 

 "Give you? Sell! How do I know you'll be back once I sell you what you want?" Freddy said, while chalking up a stick. He nodded toward a package and stepped forward leaning over the skinny kid. He put a hand on Carol's shoulder. "She'll stay here till you get back. Take him with you and make sure you return with my money." 

 Carol cringed. Not from the strong grip of his hand but from the thought of being there, alone, with them. "What's your name?" he asked gruffly. 

 The numbing fear left her wondering what Denis had called her and she certainly couldn't reveal her name to this bunch of hoodlums. Even if she had been dressed appropriately she would hesitate telling them anything, let alone revealing she was a teacher. 

 Running around skimpily dressed with a pupil was bad enough but being involved in some racket meant she had to pretend to be what they thought she was. "Cindy," she replied, imitating one of the less likeable students in class. In the dim lighting she might get away with it. 

 "Over eighteen?" Freddy asked. 

 Warily she nodded her head. 'Shit, what now?' 

 "Are you with Joey boy?" he asked. 

 "No, I'm Denis' girlfriend," she stammered, in a little quavering voice. It was easy to put on for that is how she felt, a little vulnerable thing among fierce looking men. 

 "Tell him not to hang around with that creep, you as well," Freddy advised. 

 She nodded her head still trying to hide her face in long hair. She felt small and stupid from acting like a young girl among these men who were her own age. At least it gave her some protection, though their leering looks could be imagined easily enough, almost felt upon her bare flesh. 

 "Here," he said, offering her the stick. "Shoot some pool while you're waiting." 

 It was an offer she couldn't refuse however much she wanted to go and hide in the shadows of the shabby pool hall. His voice was full of menace out of habit even when trying to be kind. 

 With a shove to her back she was propelled toward the table. It suddenly dawned on her what it meant. Leaning over the table in the damn skirt would show off her bare ass. He wasn't being thoughtful he was making her put on a show for his buddies. 

 The thong merely pursed her lips so it was a disgraceful agony knowing they would be leering at her rear end while she played. Standing there looking stupid she hoped they were teasing and wouldn't expect her to play. She was fooling herself. She felt sick from a sinking feeling in her tummy. 

 Anyone dressed this way wouldn't care about showing off her body and thinking about the Cindy in her class, she would probably revel in teasing them. One of the players took a hold of the stick and leaned over her. The smell of beer on his breath wasn't pleasant. 

 "I can do it, thank you," she rebuked him. The others laughed at Hank and he slapped her ass before standing aside. She reminded herself to keep in the role and not antagonise them. She just hoped Denis got back soon. She'd pay off the damn debt just to get out of there. 

 "That's better we can all see now," one of them quipped. 

 Carol's hand shook with anger but what could she expect looking like a silly little slut. For once she wished she had learnt to use her looks to manipulate men but this wasn't the place to start that game. One mistake and she would be in serious trouble with these rough types. 

 Bent over the table showing off her peachy ass they were less raucous than expected. Her husband's friends would have humiliated her, so maybe this wasn't so unusual in a place like this. She wondered what kind of women they were used to. 

 The word whores came to mind and she shuddered. 

 "Nice move," Hank commented, looking at the way her breasts shimmied in the boob tube.  

 

 

===

'Damn you shithead,' she thought, but smiled sweetly at him as the ball nudged the edge of the pocket and twisted in. 

 "Yea, Hank, you could learn something from the Cindy doll," Mac laughed. 

 She tried to manoeuvre around the table but the only possible shot would mean lifting her leg or leaning right over. Giving in she bent over their end of the table presenting her ass and gritting her teeth against the inevitable lewd remarks. 

 When she turned around they were discussing the football, ignoring her. It was a surprise and unaccountably she felt miffed. Becoming used to bending over the table she settled into the game, trying hard to beat him. The game continued and Carol was pleased to only lose on the black. 

 "Good game, there's more to you than meets the eye, and that's saying something," Hank smiled. "That's five you owe me," he said, holding out his hand. 

 "I don't have any on me," Carol said, lamely. The look on his face told her she was in trouble. 

 "Well, you can pay me in kind now or see how it goes on the next game. I don't mind if you build a debt it'll make the payment all the more interesting," he smiled. 

 "I can't. I'll pay you honest," Carol said, not caring what he had in mind, whatever it was just wasn't on. 

 "Freddy insists all gambling debts are paid before you leave. Don't know why you're so antsy about a kiss, you look up for it, and more," he chuckled. "You can always pay it off working for Freddy as one of his girls. I'd be your first customer sweet lips," Hank told her. 

 Was he suggesting she would whore for that gangster? Shit! They were tough enough characters not to give her a choice if she riled them. A kiss didn't seem so bad after all, just to get it over and done with. "Well, I guess. I could let you kiss me," she stammered. 

 "Maybe I'll just wait till you owe me enough to make it interesting," Hank teased. 

 "For a ten you can get those sweet lips round your dick when she's whoring for Freddy," Mac sang out. 

 "Who asked you?" Hank fired back over his shoulder. "You'd be after me in line for a sweet new one like her." 

 Carol shuddered at the thought of these men lining up to take her. Did she look so cheap they could casually assume she would stoop to being a whore? The clothes, bending over the table, associating with that skinny shit Joe, just being there, it all added up to mark her as being just another dumb slut on the make. 

 It made her feel so hopeless knowing this was the prospect for some poor girls. She could just see their squalid lives, the inevitability of whoring for an intimidating man like Freddy. "Let's just kiss, OK?" Carol said, in a flat voice devoid of emotion. 

 "Not sure I like your attitude. Anyone would think you don't like the idea of touching me," he said, with a contrived hurt look. 

 "Please, let's kiss and move on," she said, forgetting the cutesy tone of voice. 

 "You have to play another game anyway so why don't we see what happens, you nearly won. You could get lucky," Hank teased. 

 The thought of what he would want for ten appalled her. The debt might be an excuse for Freddy to get involved and that was disgusting. If Joe didn't get back she could imagine Freddy forcing her to pay the debt by whoring. 

 It would be an impossible situation when she dare not tell them who she was to get away from them. Her nerves were unravelling after a day riding a rollercoaster of emotions and she was pushing herself into a corner from guilt. She was letting her imagination get the better of her. 

 In a panic she grabbed his sleeve. "Please let me kiss you. I. I want to kiss you sir," she said earnestly. She had wound herself up into such a state she couldn't think of anyway out but comply. 

 Her name sake would have wound them up and taken their money, winning by putting them off their stroke. Cindy would have leaned over the table with plenty of cleavage on show in front of a crucial shot. Maybe she could have rattled them with just enough flirting or just making it all a bit of fun. 

 Carol was too straight to see what was happening and way out of her depth. A pair if arms wound round her for a second time that evening only these were strong muscular hard working arms. They clamped her tight with big hands lifting her off the floor by her ass. 

 She closed her eyes as he kissed her ears and neck. She opened her mouth. His tongue was thankfully fresh and gentle. She kissed him back. She was being paid for this. He had paid her for this sexual favour, so didn't that make her a whore. 

 She was dressed too provocatively, how could she blame them. The way she had acted, the way she had displayed her ass, it was all too much. It left her head spinning. He was damn good at kissing. Their breath mingled as their nostrils noisily sucked in air. 

 He was devouring her mouth and lips as though he couldn't get enough of her, wanting all of her. She no longer felt suffocated she felt alive. She felt a desperate need. She gripped his waist with her heels hanging onto him feeling large calloused hands on her soft smooth ass holding her close. 

 Finger tips pushed against her crotch and asshole. Her breasts were squashed against his chest and she couldn't help squirming against him rubbing her sensitive nipples, stimulating them into swollen buds of pleasure. 

 'I can't help it. I've been so bad I deserve to be treated like a whore, I deserve everything I get,' she told herself. Carol was so carried away she prepared for the worst, not wanting it but unable to fight the need. 

 All day she had been stimulated until giving in to be ravished by Denis. This evening she had paraded around like a slut being teased until she became a bitch on heat. How could she withstand such an assault on her morality, it had stretched her endurance to breaking point. 

 Hank perched her on the edge the pool table laying her back on the green baize. Her legs were still wide from being around his waist but they had all seen the crotch of her panties before and only casually looked her over. 

 She looked as though she had just run a marathon with hair awry and her face gleaming with perspiration. Her chest heaved up and down in the tight boob tube where her nipples protruded sharply. 

 Hank was right. She had been fired up on entering the pool room and their teasing had pushed her arousal to the limit. She had been fired up enough to let them push her along. He didn't know how she came to be with those two but something had happened earlier to get her into this state. 

 Realising she was lying there with legs open waiting to be fucked a wave of shame brought her to her senses. Before she could move he leaned in close and she froze. 

 He whispered in her ear and she closed her eyes tight with fear, letting out a stifled groan. 

 He said to her, "You're a great kisser Miss Andrews. Don't worry your secret is safe with me. Just do as you're told and I'll get you off the hook. I'm sure you don't want to spend the night whoring for Freddy," he lied, to frighten her. 

 "If they don't come back for you I'll take you home otherwise you can repay me sometime," he breathed the words seductively in her ear. 

 He patted her between the legs and pulled the crotch of her panties over her wet lips. She lie there a moment shaking. 

 "You had better get to the restroom and sort yourself out," he told her. 

 "She should pay you for a kiss like that," Mac commented casually, as though the performance were an everyday event. 

 Carol didn't even bother pulling her clothes together; she just rolled off the table and stumbled to the restroom. Holding onto a basin with both hands she tried to bring her shattered nerves together. Her left knee twitched threatening to give way. 

 '"Do as he says? Who the hell is he?" she said to the cold running water splashing around the sink. She felt her career was all washed up as her ethics drained out of her down the plughole. She thought of herself as a sensible professional woman only she had behaved like a sex starved adolescent. 

 Even the worst of the girls in class wouldn't have succumbed so shamelessly. It was true she had little experience after two dull relationships but to have lost control so easily was a shock. 

 Pulling herself together she managed to walk into the pool room knowing they thought of her as a stupid little slut, or worse. She felt belittled and humiliated but tried to hold her head high. She had been found out and could no longer hide or excuse her behaviour behind the facade of being Cindy. 

 If he kept his word she could at least play the part until the lads got back. Wondering what humiliation she was gong to be put through next she bravely walked over to Hank. Before he had a chance to provoke her yet again they turned up. 

 Hank winked at her and mouthed, "Be seeing you." 

 *** 

 They didn't wait around for Joe. Carol was glad to be hauled by Denis out of the dreadful place. In the car he told her, "He's left the house unlocked." Then he clammed up. 

 He was obviously in a huff. It was from the ribald comments the men had goaded him with on his return. 'Get you're whore home and give her a good seeing to before she rapes us, she's a natural blonde, she puts on a good show playing pool, kisses like a nympho,' they laughed. Not exactly those words but close enough. 

 Carol felt devastated. Even this nice young man was ashamed of her. Not as ashamed as she was. 

 At his questioning look she went red and dropped her gaze to her lap. Her nipples were still hard and large. The skirt was pulled open revealing her sopping panties. She wondered if he could smell her wet pussy as she cringed in the front seat. 

 She would have to buy one of those little air fresheners tomorrow, if there was a tomorrow. Her whole world might implode by then. Report_Story
