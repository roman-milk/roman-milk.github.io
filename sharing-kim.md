 Dear Reader, This is the story of a husband who wants to share his wife with his best friend . . . or does he? And what does the wife think about it? Enjoy. E.Z. 

 ******** 

 Kim and I had discussed almost everything since we started dating. We hadn't discussed Dave yet. Dave was my best friend, my very best friend. He always had been; he always would be. 

 I expected Kim to be faithful to me. Except for Dave. I expected her to fuck Dave anytime he asked. I don't mean lie there. I mean happily and enthusiastically fuck his eyes out. 

 That wouldn't be easy for Kim, but it was very important to me. Now that we'd agreed to marry, we had to discuss it. Fortunately, she brought up fidelity as we sat facing each other on the couch. Our knees were touching. Her hand stroked mine as they lay on the couch back. 

 "I want to talk about something very important to me, Jason. We've discussed it before, but I want to talk about it again," she said softly. Her tone instantly put me on alert. 

 "What's that, baby?" I asked innocently. 

 "Fidelity." 

 "It's very important to me, too," I answered. 

 "Good. I know you're much more sexually experienced then I am." 

 She looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to say something. I didn't utter a peep. Her brow wrinkled. 

 "I want to know you'll be faithful to me." She leaned forward when she said know". The word was drawn out. 

 "I've said I'd be faithful, and I will." 

 "I know, but the way you said it made me wonder. I don't think you'd lie, but it's important." 

 "Yes, it's very important. I won't live with you fucking around." 

 Her hand pulled back. Her mouth dropped open and her eyes flared. 

 "Me? You don't have to worry about me. I haven't screwed half the women in town. I mean half the men. You know what I mean." 

 "You weren't a virgin when we met." 

 "You're my third man. My first was in college. He got me drunk, so drunk I don't remember it. Chet was the second. He doesn't count." 

 "Why doesn't he?" 

 "Oh for Pete's sake, Jason. Don't change the subject." 

 "I'm not changing the subject. Even if Chet doesn't count, people change. You might be tempted to play around." 

 "Never! How could you suggest that?" 

 "Will you be faithful, Kim?" 

 She looked me square in the eye. Her face was a picture of sincerity. 

 "Of course I'll be faithful. Will you?" 

 "Yes. I'll be faithful to you." 

 Head on my shoulder, arms around me, she pressed into me. Her scent filled my nose. 

 "You don't know how happy that makes me," she whispered in my ear. 

 "I'd like to define faithful." 

 Her body became rigid. Slowly, she pushed back to look me in the eye. 

 "I know the meaning," she said flatly. 

 "This time it has a special meaning. A meaning that applies just to us." 

 She slid away from me and smoothed her skirt. She searched for and removed imaginary lint to give herself time to think. 

 "What does it mean?" 

 "Look at me, Kim." 

 Her expression was somewhere between panic and anger. 

 "Well, what does it mean?" Her tone was even; her vocal cords tight as a kite string. 

 "It means I won't have sex with any other women except Dave's women." 

 She looked me right in the eye. She was red faced. I tried to appear relaxed, but my stomach was doing cartwheels. 

 "Dave? Dave? Oh, your friend. The one you're always talking about, but I've never met because he lives in Russia." 

 "Yes. That Dave." 

 "You're going to have sex with his . . . what did you say? His women?" 

 "Yes." 

 She was redder when she spoke, but their was a cockiness in her voice. 

 "Well, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I'll have sex with Dave." 

 "Yes, you will. I insist on it." 

 She looked confused and her hands trembled. She fought to regain her equilibrium. 

 "Insist on it? You're going to insist I let your friend have sex with me? Are you mad?" 

 "No, I'm not mad, Kim. I want you to fuck him until he can't walk, not just let him have sex with you." 

 She gasped for breath and her hands clenched. When she responded, the lid came off the pressure cooker. 

 "You may not be mad, but I am. I'm very mad. As in angry. As in pissed off! Really pissed off! I'll decide later if we're still engaged. I'm leaving!" 

 She jumped to her feet and stormed toward the door. 

 "Wait, Kim." 

 She spun to glare at me. Her hands were by her sides, fists clenched in little balls. 

 "What could you possibly say that would keep me from leaving?" 

 "This is your apartment," I replied with a grin. 

 Unfortunately, that made her angrier. 

 "Get out!" she screamed, pointing toward the door. 

 As I walked by, I reached for her. She backed up, her arms crossed under her breasts. I took her in my arms. It took a few minutes, but finally she put her arms around me and lay her head on my chest. She responded when I kissed her, but she gave me a dirty look. 

 "We're still engaged. I want to marry you, Kim. Call me when you're ready to talk." 

 "Just get out," she replied. Her tone was low and she looked away from me. 

 At home, I fell into bed. Sleep was sporadic and light. It was three A.M. when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door, Kim stood there looking forlorn. Her eyes were puffy and red, the lids swollen from crying. She fell into my arms. 

 "Oh, Jason," she whimpered. "Just hold me." 

 We sat on the couch, holding each other. The crying tapered off, the tension eased. 

 "I don't understand what you said," she said. 

 "Dave's my friend. I want you to have sex with him." 

 "I'm not a whore, Jason." 

 "Dave's not going to pay you." 

 "I'm not a slut either." 

 "I don't want you to be a slut. I want you as you are: loving, fun, ladylike, and very faithful, except I define faithful as having sex with me and with Dave." 

 "I don't understand. My head aches. Can we go to bed and talk about this in the morning?" 

 I thought she would be up all night asking questions, but she was exhausted. After two aspirin and a double shot of vodka, she curled up in the crook of my arm and slept like a log. I wish I'd slept as well. When I awakened in the morning, she was on her side sleeping peacefully. 

 I love Kim. She's smart, sweet and loving. She'll be an excellent mother. She has a beautiful face, a delightful body. Sexually, we fit together like hand in glove. She's conservative in public. She dresses demurely, acts ladylike, and is above reproach. In private, she's a wild woman. No inhibitions. No reserve. She wasn't always that way. She's perfect for me. Most importantly, she loves me with all her heart. 

 Many women have wanted to marry me, but I've only proposed to one. Kim. She's the one I want to marry. 

 I'd been reading and sipping coffee for about twenty minutes when she came out of the bedroom naked, which she always is when we're alone. She walked sensually toward me, leaned over to kiss me and murmured, "Let's go back to bed." I followed the sway of her wonderful ass back into the bedroom. 

 "Come fuck me, baby. Fuck me hard," she whispered as she opened her legs wantonly. She was hot and squirming, sweating and needy as we spent the morning in my bed. I feared she'd hold back because of the Dave issue. She didn't. She was the same sexy, delightful Kim. 

 Dave wasn't mentioned again until Sunday night. Kim cooked a wonderful dinner. We finished eating, did the dishes and poured some wine. After we sat on her couch, she reopened the subject. 

 "Tell me about Dave." 

 "What do you want to know?" I was excited she asked, but tried not to show it. 

 "I'm trying to understand why the man I love, the man I want to marry, would insist I have sex with a friend of his I've never met." 

 "We're best friends. We've been best friends since the second grade." 

 "I have a best friend, too. Elizabeth. She'll be my maid of honor. I haven't suggested you have sex with her." 

 I grinned. 

 "I'm not going to suggest it either," she snapped. 

 "I didn't expect you to." 

 "You didn't answer me." 

 "Dave and I are different, I guess." 

 "I guess you are," she replied. She looked away, seeing something I couldn't see. I waited patiently. 

 "Have you shared other women with Dave?" she asked. 

 "Yes. Most of them." 

 "Like who?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Jason, give me an example." 

 "The first was Susy Simpson," I said. "We were in the ninth grade, both fifteen. Susy was seventeen. I was a virgin then. When Dave told me he was fucking her, I was jealous. Are you sure you want to hear this?" 

 "Yes. I've never asked you about other women. I'm curious. Go on." 

 "Anyway, Susy was a wet dream: senior cheerleader, big breasts, all that. Dave was the up and coming football star. One night at his house, Dave had me hide in his closet. I watched as he fucked her. Then I fucked her, too." 

 "Poor Susy. I bet she was mortified." 

 "Susy? Mortified? No way. Susy loved it. When she got hot, she was long and slow to cool down. She fucked Dave again, then I went back for a second time." 

 "She sounds like a slut." 

 "She definitely is." 

 "Is that what you want me to be?" 

 "No, Kim, I don't. I've told you this, but let me tell you again so there'll be no mistake. I want you to be faithful. If you're unfaithful, I'll divorce you." 

 

 Her eyes burned into me. 

 "But. But! There's a big, unsaid 'but' there! But - you define faithful as having sex with you and with Dave. Is that right?" 

 "Yes. With me and with Dave." 

 "You and Dave only or are there others?" 

 "No others. Just me and Dave." 

 "What about Dave's wife? What does she think of this?" 

 "She's all for it. Emily's a sexy woman." 

 "You've had sex with her?" 

 "Yes. Many times. Dave fucked her on their first date. He shared her on their third." 

 "On their first date? Isn't that . . . loose?" 

 "You told me you would've fucked me on the first date if I'd asked. Remember?" 

 She looked guilty as charged and gave me a shy little smile. 

 "Is she better in bed then I am?" she asked quietly. 

 "Of course not. You're the best ever. You're very special, Kim." 

 "Special? So special you want to share me?" 

 "So special I want to marry you. No one's ever been that special to me." 

 "Marry me and share me with Dave? It doesn't make sense." 

 "It makes perfect sense to me. Dave and I have always shared our women." 

 "Shared our women? What are we - power tools?" 

 "You power my tool," I replied with a grin. 

 A sexy grin flashed across her face before she returned to inquisitive mode, with a steely quietness. 

 "Have there been 'special' women who said 'no', Jason?" 

 "You're the only special woman I've ever known, Kim." 

 "I'm glad to hear that, but let me ask the question another way. Have any women told you 'no' when you wanted them to sleep with Dave?" 

 "Yes." She looked exasperated by my answer. 

 "Well, what happened?" 

 "We broke up." 

 "If I say 'no', you'll break up with me? Is that it? Sleeping with Dave is a condition of our marriage?" 

 "Wait a minute! I never proposed to any of those other women. I never proposed to anyone but you." 

 I was shaking, fearing she might ask the question I suddenly realized I didn't want to answer: the question I didn't know if I could answer. Will you break up with me? Would I? It was easy with the others. Yes. I broke up with them. But with Kim? Would I break up with her? Did sharing her with Dave mean that much to me? What about her? Would she break up with me if I insisted she fuck Dave? 

 She went into the kitchen, returned with the wine bottle and refilled our glasses. She took a deep breath and sat down again. 

 "Well then. Dave shares Emily with you and you get his . . . did you say 'women'?" 

 "Yes. Dave and Emily usually have another woman living with them." 

 "Why?" 

 "It gives Dave two, and Dave and Emily share the other woman. She's bisexual." 

 "Bisexual! You want me to have sex with Emily?" 

 "No." 

 "Oh, good." 

 "You can if you like. It's up to you." 

 "I'm glad something's up to me," she snapped. 

 Her mind was whirring. She had a cockiness in her voice when she spoke again, as if she thought she had found the lever to rip away my insistence about Dave. 

 "What if I want to see you and Dave have sex?" 

 "All right. So you can experience watching it." Her mouth hung open. "Emily wants to see that, too." 

 "You've had sex with Dave?" she gasped. 

 "When we were kids experimenting. That was the only time. It was a turnoff for both of us." 

 "Good God," she muttered. She went to the bathroom. When she returned, she'd changed into a bathrobe. She said, "Let's watch a movie. How about 'Sleepless in Seattle'?" 

 "That's fine with me," I answered. 

 She put on the movie and curled up next to me. We've started 'Sleepless' a dozen times. We've finished it once. The credits were on when I kissed her. I don't remember the movie after that. We made love on the couch. 

 We didn't discuss Dave for the next couple of weeks. I brought the subject up again the night she wanted final approval of the wedding invitations. 

 "Before we send these out, we need to finish our discussion about Dave," I said. 

 Kim had that sure, complacent expression women get when they think they're right. She put her arms around my neck and kissed me. 

 "Oh, Jason. I know that was a test to see if I might be unfaithful. I know you didn't really want me to agree." 

 "You're wrong, Kim. I want you to agree. You'll fuck Dave." 

 "No, I won't, Jason. I won't have sex with Dave." 

 "Yes you will," I replied evenly. 

 "And if I don't?" she said, her arms crossed, her eyes ablaze. "Will you leave me?" 

 She tried to look cock sure, but fear was obvious in her eyes. She'd asked "the" question. Would I leave her? I'd thought long and hard about it since the last time we talked. 

 "No, Kim. I won't leave you." 

 Tension fell away and a tear appeared in the corner of her eye. She looked reassured and pleased. I held her hand and waited. A smug smile crossed her face and she pulled her hand away. 

 "Well then, there's not a lot you can do about it if I don't." 

 "Yes, I can. I'll make you have sex with him." 

 "What? How could you?" 

 "I'll tie you to the bed." 

 "You wouldn't." 

 "I would." 

 "I'll fight you." 

 "I'm stronger." 

 "I'll lock my legs together!" 

 "I'll hold them open for him." 

 "I'm sure Dave's much more of a gentleman than you are. He wouldn't take me when he saw I didn't want it." 

 "Dave's no gentleman. When he saw that delicious body of yours naked and tied to a bed, he'd fuck you until you couldn't walk. But - if he stopped, I'd guide his cock to your pussy and shove on his ass until he was buried in you." 

 "You don't mean it! Do you?" 

 "What do you think?" 

 What did she think? Hell! What did I think? I'd told other woman they'd fuck Dave. All but a few did. The ones that did loved it. But . . . but why was I confused? Words and emotions at an impasse, we stared at each other. I broke the silence. I had to. It was eating me up. 

 "Shall we finalize the invitations?" 

 "Of course," she replied. 

 Kim and I married in a medium size ceremony in her hometown. We hadn't discussed Dave again. When we opened the beautiful wedding present he and Emily sent, there had been thirty seconds of questioning stares, but no discussion. Our marriage exceeded my dreams. Kim was a wonderful wife. Our life together, including sex, kept getting better and better. 

 Six months after we married, Dave e-mailed me. His annual vacation was coming up. He suggested we get together for a week in Jamaica. I decided the direct approach was the best way to broach it with Kim. 

 "How about a week in Jamaica?" 

 "Jamaica? That sounds great," she replied. "What's the occasion?" 

 "Dave and Emily are coming from Russia. We'll vacation together." 

 She froze. When she finally moved, she sat down and took my hand in hers. 

 "Do you still want me to have sex with Dave?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Why?" 

 Why did I? Why? What was there about it? What is it about sharing your wife with another man? 

 I'd made videos of Kim and me fucking, so it wasn't that. Or was it? Videos aren't real life. They're not three dimensional with the sounds and heat and nuances of real sex. 

 With Susy, it was adolescent horniness and experimentation. With Sandy, Susy's little sister, it was bonding by taking a virgin together. Don't feel sorry for her. It was her idea we do it. With Mary Elizabeth, it was retaliation when she tried to come between us. Most of the others were just good fun and we often had sex with them two on one. Emily was different. Her love of sex was as great as ours, maybe greater, and she was a true bisexual, enjoying both sexes equally. 

 Was it some deep, biological need: male bonding, primate troop, alpha male and all that? I didn't consider Dave my alpha. We were equals. Was it a sharing from the caveman days? Allocation of valuable, but limited resources? 

 Or was it part of the man to women relationship? Like maybe a control issue? Me Tarzan, you Jane. You fuck him 'cause I say so. You fuck no one else 'cause I say that, too. 

 What in holy hell was it? 

 "I don't know, but I do." 

 "I don't want to have sex with Dave," she said. 

 Curious? For the first time, she said "I don't want to" rather than "I won't." 

 "But will you?" 

 "I don't want anyone but you, Jason. I'm your wife. I love you." 

 The next two months flew as we prepared for vacation. Kim dieted and enrolled in an aerobics glass. I thought her body was perfect, but, like most women, she wanted it to be better. I'll admit her dedication did have wonderful results. Kim didn't seem apprehensive. She appeared excited about the vacation, but we didn't discuss Dave. 

 Vacation day arrived. The flight was electric. After clearing customs in Kingston, a cab drove us to the beach house we rented. The house door flew open. Dave and Emily came out. 

 Kim sized them up as she waited for me to hug them and make introductions. I'm five eleven, one hundred and seventy-five pounds. Kim's five four. Dave's six three with wide shoulders and a big, happy grin. Emily's my height, but all woman on an Amazon scale. 

 The ladies graciously murmured hellos and politely touched cheeks. When I introduced Dave, he reached for her, probably planning to wrap her in a bear hug and give her a healthy kiss. Kim stepped back, hands in front of her. He grinned and kissed the back of her hand. They led us to the private deck on the beach side for drinks and catching up on each other's lives. 

 We'd been outside about ten minutes when the door to the house opened. Kim gasped when she turned around to see. I gasped, too, when I looked. A woman was walking toward us. She was about five feet tall, blonde hair cut in a pixie style, big brown eyes and lips of medium thickness. She looked like a gymnast, with strong arms and legs and a six pack stomach, except her breasts were larger than most gymnasts I'd seen. 

 It was easy to evaluate her physically. She was naked. With the grace of an athlete and the poise of a woman who likes people watching her, she walked to Dave. 

 "Let me introduce Svetlana. Lana for short. She lives with Emily and me." 

 Lana extended her hand to shake. Kim acted like Lana's handshake was a hot potato. Lana's eyes twinkled as she curled up in Dave's lap like a kitten. She was silent as we talked, but those big eyes took in everything. I wondered how much English she understood. Kim hadn't looked at her; I couldn't take my eyes off her. The intensity of her expression drew me as much as her delightful nakedness. Dave'd said she was eighteen, only four years younger than Kim and seven years younger than the rest of us.  

 

 

===

While Dave and Emily were comfortably dressed, Kim and I hadn't changed from our travel clothes. I was about to suggest changing when Lana sat up and stretched. She arched her back. Her high, firm breasts stuck straight out. Her nipples, like dusky pointers, aimed directly at Kim. Kim froze and her eyes widened. 

 "You're both good looking. Do you like sex?" Lana asked in her heavy accent. 

 "Yes," Kim whispered, turning a bright red. 

 Lana grinned devilishly. 

 "Is he good in bed?" 

 Kim's mouth fell open and quivered a moment. She fired me a glance before answering. 

 "Yes, he's very good," she replied with a possessive intensity. 

 Lana blatantly stared at me, her eyes resting on my cock. She slipped off Dave's lap with the grace of a jungle cat easing down a tree. 

 "Let's get some sun," she said. She turned and walked away. 

 "Sun! Good idea," Dave chimed in. 

 They slipped out of their T-shirt and shorts. Neither wore underclothes. Kim couldn't take her eyes off Dave's cock. She turned red, but she couldn't turn away as if it cast a spell on her. When Emily led Dave toward the beach, Kim looked at me. I was surprised. There was no embarrassment etched on her face. There was desire and insecurity. 

 "Let's get some sun. Want to go in the buff?" I asked. 

 "No. I brought a new suit to wear." 

 I waited as she changed. Hand in hand, we strolled to the beach. Two empty loungers by the others were for us. 

 When I lay down, Dave said, "Lana, help our guest with his sun protection." 

 Lana knelt beside me, squeezed zinc oxide on her palm and applied it to my cock. She didn't look at me. She looked at my rapidly hardening member. 

 "You have a nice cock. You don't want it sunburned," she said softly as she kneaded the white paste into me. Then her hand became for pleasure rather then protection. She slowly masturbated me with zinc oxide as I lay in the sun on a Jamaican beach. She was good, keeping even pressure and a steady rhythm. Kim was watching. When she realized what Lana was doing, she knelt by me. 

 "I'll do it," she said. Lana let go and Kim took over. 

 As I felt Kim's slow, slippery hand on my cock, I watched her face. Her eyes darted back and forth. They came to rest on Dave's cock, then flitted up the beach. Her hand trembled on my cock and she stopped. 

 "Don't stop," I moaned. 

 When I saw a couple down the beach was watching us, I realized Kim's problem. No one had ever watched her in any kind of sexual activity, yet she was beating off her husband while they observed. 

 "That's okay. We'll finish later inside," I said, my hand over hers. 

 She gave me a very grateful smile and quickly lay face down on the lounger. I lay my head back and closed my eyes. I did love Kim. While I thought I wanted to share her with Dave, I wanted more for her to be happy and our life together to be wonderful. I thought about us as I lay in the sun. 

 "Time to go, big guy," Dave said, playfully swatting my arm. The sun had moved only a little, but I could feel its heat in my body. Kim was on her stomach. Her eyes were wide open looking at me. Dave started toward the house with Emily and Lana. 

 "Come on, baby. Let's shower and change," I said, offering a hand to help her up. She took my hand, but refused to look me in the eye. In silence, we walked back to the house. 

 The water was hot when Kim stepped into the shower beside me. I turned it off and lathered her with the wash gel. She babbled, like a boiler when the release valve opens. Her eyes burned into me when I washed between her legs. 

 "Okay. Your turn," I said. 

 I poured gel in her palm. Slowly, she washed me. Her babbling ceased as she caressed my body which she knew so well. She was behind me when she lathered my cock. It was instantly hard which was not surprising considering how many hands had been busy on it. Kim pressed herself into me. 

 "Jason, let's fuck. You and me. Now," she whispered as her hand slipped back and forth. 

 I faced her and she trapped my cock between her thighs. Her face was easy to read. Kim wanted to be fucked. Her hips were moving and her pussy rode on a sea of lather on the top of my cock. 

 "Do you want me to fuck you, or Dave?" I asked. 

 "You. Only you," she whispered, but a wild uncertainty flickered for an instant in her eyes. 

 "You better get that lather off him," I said with a grin. 

 The biting spray flushed away the soap. She whimpered as I pushed her back against the shower wall. Arms around my neck, she lifted herself and wrapped her legs around me. I guided my cock to her pussy. 

 "Oh, god, yes, Jason," she moaned as she lowered herself until I was buried in her. 

 Her head was back, her eyes closed. The water beat down on her hair. Her legs tightened and relaxed moving her up and down on my cock. 

 "This feels so good, baby. I love fucking you. I love it more than anything," she whispered in my ear. 

 I cupped her ass in my hands and lifted her off me. 

 "Don't stop," she said before she realized I was heading for the bed. I threw her on her back. She laughed and spread wide. 

 "Come on. Stick it in me," she demanded. 

 I plowed into her. She wrapped her legs around me and held on. I love fucking Kim. Her pussy's tight and wet. She's hot and sweaty and active and talkative. The talking's babbling sometimes, or moaning. It's always noises of pleasure. She thrust hard against me, meeting me stroke for stroke as she mumbled in my ear. 

 She orgasms with abandon. Her first one, which came quickly, was accompanied by a high shriek. She was on her way to a second when she squealed and shoved me away. I couldn't stop. I came, shooting my load on her stomach. She wasn't looking at me. She was staring open- mouthed over my shoulder. I turned to see Emily wearing a big smile and nothing else. 

 "It's a shame to waste all that good cum," Emily said. 

 Kim was still, as if tied in place by invisible Lilliputians. She turned beet red from head to toe and her muscles twitched, but she didn't move or speak as Emily licked my cum from her stomach. When Emily was finished, she kissed Kim lightly on the top edge of her black bush. The two women stared at each other until Emily squeezed Kim's thigh lovingly. Kim smiled shyly. 

 "Dave bought us matching outfits, Kim," Emily said. "I left yours on the chair. He wants us to go without underwear. See you two later." She closed the door behind her. 

 Kim ran for the protection of the shower. When I rejoined her, tears were in her eyes. She lunged, wrapping me in a bear hug. I waited for her to speak. 

 "I'm not going to fuck Dave. You go ahead with Emily and Lana. Enjoy them. I understand, but I don't want Dave." 

 I kissed her hard and long as the water washed over us. I turned it off and we started drying each other. 

 "Did you hear me? I'm not going to do it." 

 "I heard you. Relax. It's going to be okay. I love you," I said. "I love you more than you know." 

 "I love you, too. I love you so much. I'm scared - so very, very scared - I'll do something to damage what we have. I don't want anything to come between us. Please! Tell me everything'll be all right." 

 "Everything'll be fine," I replied lovingly and wrapped my arms around her. 

 The outfit Emily left was red cotton. The top was like a cropped T-shirt, ending below the breasts. The bottom was a wrap around skirt with an imbedded rope belt. It came to mid thigh. Kim stared at it. I had on my shorts and shirt before she looked at me. 

 "Without underwear?" she asked. 

 "That's what Dave likes," I replied. 

 "You want me to do what Dave likes?" 

 "What have I told you?" 

 "Tell me again. Please." 

 "Do what Dave likes," I said. I gave her a kiss and joined the others. 

 When Kim joined us, she was braless and her magnificent breasts bounced in unfettered glory. I wondered if she wore panties. 

 A taxi took us down the beach a few miles to a nice restaurant. A steel band was playing and people were dancing. The wine and food were good. Kim set next to Dave, with Emily on his right and Lana on Kim's left. Dave performed his best seduction routine: funny, masculine, but innocent in a devilish way. Kim was responding. She continually sent me questioning looks seeking my approval. 

 When I danced with Lana, she was Mercury in my arms. I danced with Emily next. She's a foot taller and more substantial than Lana, but light as a feather. Kim danced the first two with Dave. I'd watched them. No doubt there was a lot of body contact. I'd seen Dave's hand all over her back, including feeling that great ass of hers. She was relieved when I asked her to dance. 

 "Your friend's trying to seduce me," she said, crushing herself against me. 

 "How's he doing?" I said with a laugh. 

 "It's not funny! Jason, I. Oh, damn! See that big guy over there, the one with the chubby red head?" 

 "Yes." 

 "I think I'll go ask him if he wants to fuck." 

 A bolt of jealous rage went through me. My whole body tightened and shook. Kim felt it. Then she felt me yank her against me, holding her hard enough to make her gasp for breath. 

 "What's wrong?" she asked. 

 "You know damn good and well what's wrong. You fuck someone else and I'll divorce you. Mention it again and I'll spank you until you can't sit down for a week," I said angrily. 

 The surprise of her face was replaced by a warm, gentle expression and a devilish twinkle. "You're jealous, aren't you? You want me to fuck Dave, but you're jealous of everyone else." 

 "Be quiet and dance." 

 "My, my. Jason the Jealous. That sheds a new light on things." 

 I shoved her head against my shoulder. She wrapped her arms around my waist and crushed her body to mine. We finished the dance without speaking. By the time the music ended, I was back under control. I didn't understand the jealous rage either, but it was there and it was substantial. When we returned to the table, Emily said she was ready to go. 

 The cab returning us was smaller than the one which brought us. There was room for only three people. Dave, Emily and I sat on the seat. Lana slipped in and curled up in my lap. Kim had a decision to make. Did she get on Dave's lap or Emily's? She finally took a very deep breath. She seemed to hold it as she climbed in Dave's lap. The cab began bumping down the road. 

 I put my hand on Lana's thigh. It was hot, muscular yet soft. As I slipped my hand up her leg, she kissed me. 

 "No," Kim said sharply. I stopped and looked at her. 

 She was speaking to Dave. His right hand was between her legs. He was holding her left arm behind her. Her right hand was on his wrist trying to stop him. I could see the tendons move in his arm. 

 "You're wearing panties," he said. "That's a bad girl, Kim. I said no panties." 

 "Please, Dave," Kim moaned. 

 "They're dripping wet. Where did the wetness come from, Kim? Do you want to be fucked?" 

 "No," she whispered. She was looking in his eyes. 

 "Want me to finger you, Kim?" 

 She didn't answer. His hand moved again. Kim emitted a strangled "aarrrgh". Her mouth hung open. The smell of pussy filled the little cab. The driver was going crazy trying to see what was happening in the back seat. 

 "What do you want, Kim?" Dave asked. 

 "Please," Kim moaned. 

 "Please what?" 

 "Stop," she gasped. 

 He let her go. She shook and slumped against him. Her face was blank. Emily's hand was inside the leg of my shorts, playing with my cock. I stopped her. I didn't want to come yet. 

 Everyone except Kim was headed for the door when I exited the cab. She sagged against me, letting me help her into our room where she collapsed on the bed. 

 "Did you orgasm from Dave's finger?" I asked. 

 "No," she replied. 

 She was sitting on the edge of the bed looking at the floor. I cupped her chin and raised her head to look at me. 

 "That's the first time you've lied to me. Don't ever do it again, Kim," I said sternly. "Is there something you want to say?" 

 "Yes, I lied. I'm sorry I did it, Jason, but . . . I didn't want you to think I got pleasure from Dave." 

 "Why not? I want you to enjoy him. I plan to enjoy Lana tonight." 

 "If that's what you want, go ahead, but how about me? I'd like to have sex, too." 

 "You'll be with Dave." 

 "No," she said. 

 I didn't say anything. She was waiting, waiting for me to say what she wanted to hear. Her shoulders were tense. She was still. I slipped my shorts off. My cock ached. It'd been hard for some time. 

 "All right. You don't have to have sex with Dave. It's your decision." 

 Her head snapped up. She was stunned with a slack jawed, blank eyed expression. 

 

 "That's what you want, isn't it?" 

 She couldn't speak. She just stared at me. 

 "Isn't that what you want?" 

 "I want you to know I love you more than anything. I want you to be secure in that love." 

 "I am, but what do you want?" 

 "I want to please you. I'm so desperately afraid you'll be mad at me. I'm so frightened something'll change what I have with you." 

 "But part of you wants him. Part of you wants to jump on your back and spread your legs for him." 

 "Of course not." 

 "And the part that's the ladylike Kim won't let the bad-girl Kim say it." 

 "There's no bad-girl Kim. There's nothing to say." 

 Dave charged through the door with Emily and Lana right behind him. All three were naked. 

 "Why are you still dressed?" Dave said to Kim. 

 When Kim backed away, I grabbed her wrists and leveraged her arms straight behind her. When she looked at me over her shoulder, her eyes were alive with excitement. She didn't struggle. She waited for Dave to come to her. 

 Dave took Kim's head in his hand and pulled her to him. He kissed her hard and long. His other hand massaged her breasts, which are very sensitive. Kim moaned and her arms went limp in my hands, her hips started to move. 

 "Do you want me, Kim?" he said softly. 

 Her arms tightened again. She twisted, trying to break my hold for the first time. 

 "No," she said unconvincingly. 

 "Okay," Dave replied with a grin. "Say, Jason, is Lana going to spend the night with you?" 

 Kim was dumbfounded. She stood rooted in place, trying to figure out what was happening. 

 "Of course," I replied with a laugh. 

 "Good," Lana said. 

 Lana pulled back the covers, flopped on the beds with legs splayed and patted the spot beside her. Dave and Emily wished us sweet dreams as they left. 

 "Get undressed and join us," I said to Kim as I lay down by Lana. 

 Lana engulfed me with her hot, wet mouth. I felt her tongue on the underside. Lana loved doing it and it showed. Kim loved doing it, too. She always had, to my infinite pleasure. Kim watched her man's cock going in and out of the mouth of this young Russian girl intent on pleasing him. Absentmindedly, she began to rotate a nipple between her fingers. Lust filled her face. 

 I pride myself on lasting a long time, but it had been a day filled with sexual tension. I needed to cum. Lana licked and kissed her way up my body, ending astride. She grinned down at me as she slowly lowered herself onto my cock. Her pussy quivered on my cock head as I started in. I felt her spasm over and over until her pubis was against mine and she stopped. 

 "Move," I moaned. 

 "No. You don't need to cum, do you?" she asked teasingly. 

 I flipped her on her back. Her eyes were wide with delight as I pounded into her, pounded over and over, as hard, as fast, as I could. 

 "Fuck me, fuck me! So strong," she murmured in my ear. 

 I groaned loudly when I exploded in her. She laughed and her pussy spasmed, milking me. When I recovered, and it was a while, Kim was gone. Quietly, I slipped out of bed. 

 The main room was lit only by moonlight filtering through the uncurtained windows. I heard Kim groan. Her soft voice floated to me from the couch. 

 "Fuck me, Dave." 

 This is it! I thought. She's doing it. She's fucking Dave. My heart raced. My cock hardened. I'd been waiting for this. Waiting for my wife to fuck my best friend. I had to see! 

 I took a step. It hit me again. Jealousy. A rage of harsh jealousy. I felt my adrenalin pumping and sweat pouring from me. I'll kill them both, I thought. 

 Like a cat, I snuck to the couch. Kim's eyes were closed. One hand was massaging a breast. The other was between her legs. She groaned again as her body shook. She'd called his name. She'd masturbated while thinking of Dave. 

 My emotions at that instant were different then I expected. I felt very proprietary toward Kim, very possessive and protective. I'd shared every other women with Dave. Everyone. But never Kim, who is the one woman I wanted to share my life. I'd never shared my wife. 

 My wife. Mine! It hit me like a brick. That was the difference. Finally, I knew what I wanted. I wanted her to fuck him, but I wanted Dave and her both to know she was mine. Mine. Not ours. Not his. Mine. 

 When I slipped my arms under her to lift her up, she squealed in surprise. 

 "Oh my god, how long were you there?" she asked as I lifted her in the air. "Please, Jason, tell me. How long?" 

 "Be quiet. You shouldn't have left my bed," I said as I carried her toward the bedroom. 

 "You heard me, didn't you? Jason! I love you! Only you, Jason!" 

 I dropped her on the bed. Lana grinned broadly and moved over to give us room. Kim looked horrified as I unwrapped her skirt and removed her top. I ripped the cum soaked panties off her. Her smell filled the air. 

 "I love you, Jason," Kim sobbed. 

 "I love you, too, and I'm going to fuck you to oblivion," I replied as I crawled between her legs. 

 So hot and slick! Her body was so hot and slick. Her pussy was a sea of hot, viscous love I slammed into as hard as I could. My hands dug into her shoulders. Her legs scissored around my waist. 

 "Fuck me, lover. Fuck me so good. So good! I need it! I need you fucking me," she barked as I plunged harder and harder. 

 She was very ready. Her masturbating hadn't relieved her tension an iota. I felt the subtle signs, heard her breathing change. She screamed when she came. Harder! I fucked her harder. She came again and again. 

 "More! More!" she whispered. 

 More she got! My legs spasmed, pain shooting through my ass to my brain. I wanted to hold out forever, but I knew it wouldn't be much longer. Nails dug into my back. She groaned like a dying animal as she crushed my ribs with her legs. She arched, raising us both off the mattress. A giggle. She collapsed and I exploded, filling her with seed. 

 My body crushed her into the mattress. I pinned her hands over her head and pulled her head back, exposing her throat. I gave her a hickey. Not a small one. A large one. On the left side in front. She was startled at first. When she realized what I was doing, she relaxed and let me have my way. I took my time. I sucked until it was the size of a grapefruit and purple in color. It was very visible. 

 I knew exactly what it meant and so did she. I was an animal. A male animal. She was my female. I staked my territory. I marked her with my sign. This female was mine! 

 "Hey! Wake up!" 

 Someone was shaking my foot. I opened my eyes with a squint to see Emily grinning down at me. 

 "Everyone's ready to eat! Come on!" 

 I quickly showered, slipped on shorts without underwear and a top. They were already eating when I sat down at the table. 

 "Good morning, Jason," Kim said coquettishly. Her eyes gleamed as she kissed me hotly. 

 I expected the hickey to be an embarrassment to her. I expected to find her in a high top or to have covered it with makeup. I was wrong. She was in the top and wraparound Dave had bought for her. She displayed the hickey proudly as if she'd won a medal. Huge and multicolored, it could be seen a mile away. 

 Conversation was animated. We were going into Kingston to shop. The women hurriedly did the dishes, finishing as the cab honked its horn. They grabbed their purses and started toward the door.  

 

 

===

"Wait a minute," Dave said. "Where're you going?" 

 They stopped and stared at him. 

 "Pussy check," he said with a grin. 

 Emily laughed and raised her skirt to reveal her thick bush. She wore no underwear. Lana also was pantieless. Holding her skirt hem, Kim looked at me. I nodded and she raised the skirt for Dave's inspection. 

 "Unh, unh. No panties allowed. Come here, woman." 

 Kim didn't move. I put a hand on her back and gently nudged her toward him. She didn't resist, but she stopped moving to him unless I pushed. She quivered when he pulled her panties down. Dave stood and kissed her hard as his hand massaged her pussy. 

 "Today's the day I fuck you, Kim," he said as he released her. 

 "No," she replied softly. When she turned to me, her expression made me shake like I had palsy. 

 Shopping was fun. The five of us laughed as we wandered through the small shops. Three scantily clad attractive women drew more than a few stares. Their movements were sensual, their faces hot. They enjoyed the men looking, but when Kim thought the appraisals were too strong, she answered by taking my hand and turning to flash the mark I'd made on her. One time, there was wild happiness in her eyes when three young men whistled at them. 

 "Would you like me to fuck one of them?" Kim whispered in my ear. 

 I gave her a nasty look and walked away. She slipped in front of me and blocked my path. Her eyes were alive as she held onto my shirt. 

 "Will I get spanked for mentioning it?" 

 I tried to move around her, but she wrapped her arms around my waist, holding on like a leech. 

 "Well? Will I? I hope so. It'll show me you love me, but why would you get mad? I know. Because I'm your wife. I belong to you. The thought of me with any other man - except Dave - drives you nuts." 

 "You're right. Your mine. And Dave's." 

 "No. Yours alone. If I go to Dave, it'll be because you insisted. No matter how hot I may be, or how much I want some other man, I'd never do it voluntarily. I'd never hurt you and I wouldn't risk losing you." 

 "What's so secretive?" Emily asked interrupting us. 

 We returned to the beach house after lunch to eat, sun and nap. My nap was with a happy and playful naked Kim in my arms. We dined at a different restaurant that night. The women wore dresses rather than Dave's outfit, but they were naked underneath. Dave and I danced with all three of them and fought off other men trying to pick off the spare woman. We had a wonderful time and laughed as we rode home. 

 After Kim and I entered our bedroom, I closed the door behind us. 

 She made sure I was watching her as she unzipped her dress and gracefully stepped out of it. She was wearing only thigh high stockings, low heels and a big hickey on her neck. 

 "Ready to fuck Dave?" I asked. 

 "I told you that I don't want Dave," she replied. 

 "I've told you I want you to do it, but that it's your decision." 

 "I've told you I'm not going to do it voluntarily." 

 "Kim, what would you do if you were me?" I asked. 

 "I'm not you." 

 "If you were?" 

 "I'm not. Anyway, I'm not sure what's in your mind. I don't think you're sure about it. I don't think you really know if you want to share me with Dave. All those other women you shared without a doubt. You broke up with the ones who wouldn't do it. But - with me - you're not sure. Am I right?" 

 "That's possible," I answered ducking a direct response. I already knew the answer. 

 "That makes me feel very special, and you marked me as yours." 

 "I love you. I don't want to make you do something you don't want to do." 

 "I love you, too. I don't want to do something to make you angry or to hurt you. I'm afraid of damaging our relationship." 

 "What would you do?" 

 "Jason, I don't want to lose you." 

 "You're not going to lose me. Answer the question." 

 "All right. Theoretically. If I were the man, and I really meant it when told my wife to have sex with my friend, and she refused . . . " 

 Her eyes were bright with an intensity I'd never seen from her. Her body was tense, every sense on alert. 

 "....I'd keep the promise I made." 

 "What promise?" I asked. 

 "The promise made the night wedding invitations were selected." 

 I remembered that promise and grinned broadly. She turned a bright red, but didn't look away. 

 "I love you, Jason. I love you with all my heart," she said tenderly. 

 "I love you, too," I replied. "Finish undressing. I'll be back in a minute." 

 I had a nice visit with Dave and his ladies. Fortunately, he had brought the toys I needed. Kim was pacing the floor when I returned. She was shaking a little, but her eyes were bright and eager. 

 "What are those things?" she asked. 

 "Restraints. Lay back." 

 As I fastened the restraint around her wrist, she said softly, "Tell me you love me." 

 "I love you, Kim. I always have. I always will." 

 "I love you, too. Are you really going to do this?" 

 "Yes." 

 "I'm not sure I believe you, but if you are, please, Jason, do me one favor." 

 "What?" 

 "No foreplay. Just do it." 

 Tears filled her eyes and slipped down her cheeks as I fastened her arms to headboard. They were tears of excitement, of sexual need, tinged with fear I really was playing a game with her. Her skin was a hot pink. Her nipples were a rose-colored granite. Her pussy lips were bloated and slick. I pulled her legs back and tied them wide and open. 

 She was pulling to test her bondage when Dave, Emily and Lana entered the room. They were naked. Dave's cock bounced in front of him, hard and straight. Kim raised her head to stare at it. I don't think she saw anything else. Lana sat on the bed by me and Emily set up a video camera. Dave stood over Kim. 

 "Ready to fuck, Kim?" Dave said with a smile. 

 "No, Dave," she replied. She looked at me to make sure I'd heard her. 

 "You still don't believe I'm going to share you with Dave, do you?" I said. 

 "No." 

 "Come here, Dave," I said patting the bed between Kim's legs. 

 As he knee-walked over her, his cock bounced against her pubis. She couldn't help herself. She moaned and raised her pelvis to get him in her. Startled, she jerked back. She looked frightened as she stared into my face. 

 "It's okay. Remember - I said to fuck him eagerly and happily. You're going to fuck Dave now, Kim. I guiding his cock to your pussy. There. Feel him lodged in your opening? I'm rubbing his cock on your pussy lips. Feel it? My hand's on his ass now. I'm pushing him into you." 

 Every muscle in her hard body was tight, ass raised in the air, arms corded, as she pulled against the ropes. Her mouth was open. She didn't blink. She was a statue except for the muscles in her stomach and ass, which clinched and unclinched with every millimeter of his progress into her. 

 Dave stopped and waited when his pubis touched hers. Kim hadn't moved. She exhaled slowly. Quickly, I yanked the velcro, releasing her restraints. Her head turned toward me, eyes staring and unbelieving. 

 "You did it. He's in me. He's in me all the way," she whispered. 

 "Fuck him! Fuck him now!" 

 Kim screamed as her legs flew down, jamming her heels into the bed. Her arms wrapped around Dave and she lifted him in the air. 

 "Holy shit," Dave murmured. 

 Kim's face contorted. She emitted a high-pitched screech as her first orgasm ripped through her. Dave started pounding her as if his life depended on it. Kim fucked him back with every stroke. 

 They were doing it! My wife and my best friend! They were fucking! And I was inches away watching them! 

 I heard a moan behind me. Emily shoved Lana on her back and buried her face in her pussy. Lana wrapped those strong legs around Emily's head and thrust against her. 

 "More, more," Kim said. 

 She was fucking him back hard. Teeth gritted, she hung on by her nails. Dave's back was torn with droplets of blood oozing from him. 

 That's it, baby, I thought. Fuck him like he's never been fucked in his life. 

 "Harder, Dave! Fuck me harder!" 

 Whirling Dervishes! Mad dogs! That's how they were! Muscles straining. Breath heavy! I was stroking my cock as I lay by them. The smell! The heat! It was overpowering - the experience that blew my mind. 

 "Now! Now! Goddamn it, now!" Kim screamed. 

 Dave couldn't hold back. His ass jumped. He groaned loudly. Kim's nails dug into his ass and held him to her. 

 "Oh, God! Oh, God! Yes! Yes!" 

 Her face was anguish. Her body was rigid. Her eyes rolled back in her head as Dave collapsed on her. 

 The bed moved. Lana and Emily slipped behind me and Emily kissed me. I could taste Lana's juices on her. My cock was hard. I really needed to cum. Kim was trapped under Dave, his dead weight pinning her to the bed. Her head was toward me. 

 "Let me take care of that," Emily whispered, dragging her nails down my shaft. 

 "No," Kim mumbled. "No." 

 She was too tired to move, but she fought to speak. 

 "Mark me with it." 

 "What?" I asked. 

 "Cum on my face, Jason." Kim said. "Mark me with your cum to show I'm yours." 

 That started it. Just her words. I felt the tingles, the tightness. I stuck my cock in her face and groaned as squirt after squirt covered her face and hair. She smiled feeling its sticky weight. 

 "Jason's," Kim mumbled as she passed out. 

 I looked at my sweet wife laying there with her face covered in my cum and my best friend splayed on top of her. As I collapsed by her, I was as happy as I'd ever been. 

 My cock started to soften, but Emily had other ideas. She rolled Dave off Kim. Kim blinked up at her through her cum covered eyes. 

 "May we?" Emily asked very softly. 

 Kim nodded and smiled. Her hand sought mine. I squeezed back. Emily mounted me. Her thick bristle rubbing against my cock made him respond despite the tremendous release only a minute ago. Lana was over Kim like a cat, licking all the cum from her. I swear Lana was purring. 

 I started to roll Emily over, but she stopped me. 

 "Let me do this, Jason," she said. 

 I wasn't strong enough to overcome her if I wanted to, which I didn't. Emily's tight pussy moved slowly up and down. Her breasts swayed invitingly above me. Kim moaned. I saw Lana sucking on her nipples before slipping down to suck Dave's cum out of her. When Lana's tongue flicked her clit, Kim groaned. A shock went through her as she orgasmed again. Emily whimpered and started to move faster. She was starting to boil. I boiled with her. 

 I awakened the next morning about daybreak. Kim was curled up against me with her leg over mine and her head on my chest. I slid out of bed to go pee. Kim was right behind me. 

 "Want to go back to bed?" I asked. 

 "No. I want to talk," she answered. 

 I led her out the back toward the beach. Was it just yesterday she wouldn't go to the beach without a suit? Now she was going naked and obviously well fucked with dried saliva and cum on her face and body. We held hands as we walked. The day was already warm. No one else was up at this hour. We walked some distance without speaking and started back. 

 "Is everything all right?" she asked softly. 

 "Yes, very much all right. How about you?" 

 She grinned. "You know the answer to that. I loved it." Her expression became serious. "I was afraid you'd be angry with me. I couldn't believe you'd really share me." 

 "You wanted him from the start, didn't you?" 

 "No, not from the start." 

 "You're playing games." 

 "All right. I'll be honest. When you mentioned it, I was horrified, but as I thought about, it intrigued me. By the time we married, I knew I'd fuck Dave if you insisted and I hoped you'd insist. But - I was going to make sure, really sure, that's what you wanted before I said or did anything." 

 She stopped in front of me and wrapped her arms around me. 

 "Don't you see, Jason? Don't you understand? I could live the rest of my life with no other man - only you, but the idea of another man was very exciting to me. When you shoved him in me, I couldn't believe it, but I loved it." 

 "Would you fuck someone else if I asked you to do it?" 

 "Please don't ask me. If you do, I'd tell you no and I'll mean it." She kissed me very softly. "Look, Jason, with Dave, we both wanted me to do it, but with any others, the jealousy would tear us apart. Now. You be honest with me." 

 "It wasn't like I imagined. I've never been jealous before, never in my life. When you teased about fucking that guy with the red head, I went nuts. You're right about the jealousy." 

 "But with Dave . . .?" 

 "No jealousy. It was a real turn on for me, but, Kim, there won't be any others." 

 "That's just the way I want it. Just you. Only you . . . and Dave only if you tell me to do it." Her eyes were bright and happy. 

 "Say, that hickey looks particularly big and purple in the sunlight. I hope it goes away before we get home," I said. 

 "I don't. I like people to know I'm your woman." 

 "Hum. Maybe I should mark you permanently." 

 "All right. If you want to." 

 We kissed softly and gently. The waves lapped at the beach. Sea gulls cawed overhead. The sun was starting to warm us as we walked back toward the house. 

 All was right in our world. 

 ***** Epilogue 

 "Should I wear panties, Jason," Kim asked with a smile on her face. 

 She was naked. Except for white irregular shapes around her pussy where the zinc oxide had been, she was brown as a berry. She hadn't worn panties or much of anything else for the entire vacation. 

 "No panties," I replied with a grin. 

 "Oh, my. What'd the people at the office say?" 

 She slipped into a sundress, added thigh high stockings and heels. We were going home. Vacation was over. After dropping our bags on the front porch, I went to the back porch for one last visit. It'd been a wonderful week. Kim'd released the sexual power inside her. Lana and Emily had, too. Dave and I were looking forward to going back to work. They almost fucked us to death. 

 "I have a sister in St. Petersburg," Lana said. "She'd love to come in America if she had an arrangement like I do." 

 "That's come to America," I replied with a laugh. Lana may have meant it the way it was said. We were talking about our plans to visit Moscow in the spring when the taxi sounded its horn. 

 When the plane was airborne, Kim asked for a blanket. She spread it over both of us and curled toward me. She guided my hand to her bare leg and began stroking my cock through my trousers. 

 "I know you love me. I still don't understand why you wanted Dave to have me." 

 "I'm not sure of that myself, but I did. God, I loved watching you with him. You were so hot." 

 "Well, you can watch all you want with the videos Emily made. With those and the videos you made of us, I'm having quite a film career." 

 She laughed. Her hand had been busy under the blanket. After all the fucking during the vacation I thought I'd never say this again, but I was horny as hell. 

 "Can you be satisfied with one man when we get back?" I asked. 

 She smiled lovingly. 

 "I know now why you asked my if I'd always be faithful. Things do change. I loved all the sex this week, with you and Dave, and with Emily and Lana, too, which surprised me. But - I'm still Kim, your wife. I'll be faithful to you, Jason. Not you and Dave, but you. Don't ever worry about that." 

 "What part did you like best?" I asked. 

 "Your marking me. The hickey. Cumming on my face with another man in me. That possiveness. That fierce, demanding ownership." We kissed again. "Do you plan on marking me when we get home?" 

 "Yes. I was trying to decide between piercing and a tattoo." 

 "What? I was thinking of a nice gold necklace with your initial dangling from it, or an anklet." 

 "Maybe that, too, but the others have a lot of appeal." 

 She looked at me intently before deciding I might be teasing. "Whatever you want, baby. I'm yours." 

 "And I'm yours," I replied before I kissed her. 

 She was radiant, but a devilish look came into her eye. 

 "Say. We're not halfway home yet so we're still on vacation. Want to slip back to the bathroom and join the mile-high club?"
