 Sophie was at her wits end with her stepdaughter Libby. Her husband, Libby's father, had died in a car crash leaving them well provided for rattling around together in a palatial home that was empty and cold without him. Libby had slipped into bad company and was drinking too much and who knew what else. It would be understandable being resented, if she had tried to take her mothers place, but Sophie had tried hard not to give that impression. Rather she attempted to be a friend rather than step mom. Being just eight years older than the girl it was difficult to take control although she had to admit it wasn't in her nature to be the one in charge. Her daughter took after her father, in a word, domineering. This uncomfortable situation demanded drastic action and so an arrangement had been made, somewhat reluctantly, to have the young woman taught self discipline for her own good. A friend of a friend had put her in contact with someone experienced in dealing with wilful teenagers of wealthy parents. The man had agreed to take on the task of taming her even though she was out of the usual age group at twenty years old. 

 A one-page synopsis of the problem behaviour had been emailed to the trainer, as he called himself, and with that she felt somewhat relieved that someone else was taking over the problem. The arrangement was easily kept secret from Libby as they hardly ever spoke except when she demanded money. The trainer had emailed back with instructions not to warn the girl of the arrangement. Any day now he would call and spirit her away leaving Sophie with a few weeks of peace. The expected awkward confrontation bothered her until reassured it would all happen while she was out of the house. It all seemed so cloak and dagger and adventurous, as well as it being revenge at last, leaving Sophie with a thrilling sense of anticipation. 

 Saturday morning and Libby hadn't arrived home from a Friday night party, leaving the large sprawling house quiet and peaceful. Sophie had determined to make friends in the area so had joined a tennis club and was looking forward to the first lesson. Not wanting to be home when the young tormentor finally arrived she quickly dressed in tennis whites ready to go. A white blouse, short white pleated skirt, ankle socks and white trainers completed the outfit. Smart, perhaps a little too neat, but it reminded her of lazy carefree school days. 

 The front door bell rang. Dropping the sports bag she dragged reluctant feet to the door expecting an ugly confrontation with Libby. The sun streamed into the oval atrium blinding her yet she could see from the dark outline of a large built man it wasn't Libby. An authoritative voice asked, "Libby?" Sophie inwardly groaned wondering what trouble the little terror had caused now. It was useless to deny she lived there for they would merely return later. 

 "Yes?" The one word was all she managed to say. 

 The man pointed to something behind her asking, "What's that?" She turned to look and was confused seeing nothing there. In that split second a strong hand clench both wrists behind her back. Instinctively opening her mouth to shout a protest a gag was deftly inserted and the next moment she was hauled over his shoulder. Before she could gather her wits she was bundled into a van and driven away down the crunching gravel driveway. The gravel gave way to a smooth road surface with Sophie listening intently for clues as to where they were going and what was happening. As the adrenalin rush subsided she began to think more clearly. Trussed like a chicken for the oven she could hardly move from where she had been placed in a cardboard box. This had all been carefully planed so it wasn't Libby's friends playing a prank. Then it sank in. This was her plan, going dreadfully wrong. 

 Sophie laughed hysterically into the gag. The fear turned to embarrassment on realising she was going to have to explain she wasn't Libby but the mother. It was her fault as she had answered to her name at the door meaning only to confirm Libby lived there. There had been little excitement in her life so this would be something to laugh over with friends in the future. She could imagine it now, telling them how she was dragged out of her own home and the terror felt being driven away by a stranger. Being kidnapped was a rare situation to be in but as it was she who had made the arrangements, it all seemed so ridiculous. The trainer had hinted in his email this might be necessary but she hadn't imagined it to be so dramatic. 

 There hadn't been a chance to explain anything once they arrived. She had been expecting to point out the error and for them to share an embarrassed moment where they laughed at the mistake. Instead she had been carried over his shoulder into a barn then callously dumped into a stall still tied and gagged. On realising he had no intention of removing the gag she yelled and shook her head trying to explain through frustration and anger struggling furiously. 

 "Look here Libby. Calm down. You're going nowhere. You're here to learn respect for your elders. Your parents arranged this and I'm going to train you to behave like a proper and respectful young woman. Get that into your head right now. Do you ear me?" The tall man said, speaking slowly and forcefully. 

 Sophie shook her head wanting to explain he had got it all wrong. "It's no good I'm not letting you loose until you calm down. You won't get the pampering you're used to, not here. You will have to earn everything you get. You will have to earn every little thing until you value it. Your freedom, food, clothing, shelter, even the small things in life you take for granted will have to be earned. Your attitude and hard work will be the way to earn them. I'll leave you alone to think about it." He said. 

 "At least the straw is fresh." She thought. Thinking about it, all that he said, applied to her too. She had experienced a privileged upbringing as an only daughter of a rich man, widowed when she was born just like Libby. Only she hadn't the same rebellious streak Libby had, she had conformed, bent to the wind. "OK." She said to herself, "Go along with it until I get the chance to explain." 

 He woke her with the toe of his boot keeping back, out of reach. "You calmed down now?" He asked. For a moment she wondered where she was. The smell of horses and the straw brought back the awful trouble she was in. She nodded, attempting to look calm even relaxed. 

 He knew exactly what to do having been at the job a long time. Usually they were younger and had parental rights over them but this was different. This was the summer break with no one but the two of them on the ranch. Meaning there were no female staff to look after the more personal chores such as making sure she dressed and bathed as ordered. It might be an indelicate operation but he had on rare occasions dealt with female prisoners in the army so he could rely on rigid self-control to get them both through the next few weeks. In the army it had just been a job, breaking people for information. After retiring from the army he considered this was just a job, only it was well paid. He was looking forward to a second retirement with this young rich kid a last minute chore. Once it was over the new guy could take on the business. 

 It was no good she couldn't hold on any longer she had to let go of her bladder. In the stall she wet her panties and skirt embarrassing herself before him. "This time I'll assume you didn't do that on purpose. Next time there will be a punishment for any acts of disobedience. Did I neglect to inform you of that?" Sophie didn't look at him she merely kept her gaze to the ground while he untied her. Taking no chances he attached her wrists to a stiff leather belt then led her across the muddy yard to a shower block. "When you're clean you can dress, then eat." He informed her. 

 "At last!" She thought, "The gag will have to be removed for me to eat." Eagerly she entered the concrete building where he removed the belt. 

 "You can undress. The shower is easy to figure out. Don't forget, you do exactly as I say at all times." He stated flatly. A row of showerheads stuck out of one wall in the large concrete room each with a tap below it. He stood there with arms folded as though telling her he was on guard and wouldn't budge even if she could protest. 

 The sooner this was over the sooner she could explain the mistake so she reluctantly stripped out of the muddy trainers and dirty clothes. Stepping under the shower she turned on the tap. Cold water splashed over her naked body taking her breath away. She would have to bend over to the floor for the soap; there were no delicate porcelain soap holders here. He wasn't looking at her but he was there making it all the more humiliating that he took no interest in her body. 

 Perhaps her husband had married for money, even though he was wealthy, but her body was a prize in itself. It was a trim five foot four with firm small breasts over a flat tummy, slim shapely legs below a pert bottom. Her skin was smooth silky porcelain white, emphasised by long shiny black hair that hung down her back. Her face had the look of innocence from having had little experience of life that sometimes marked a married woman of twenty-eight. 

 The towel was small, rough and thin, so unlike the soft fluffy bath towels she was used to but it did the job just the same. The gag had been rinsed of her spit and even the coldness of the shower seemed to have a deep cleansing effect. Her nipples stood at attention seemingly huge in proportion to her breasts yet she didn't notice this with all her attention focused upon the garment he handed her. It wasn't much more than a sack. With her own clothes in a soaking wet muddy heap in the corner of the shower block there was no choice, even if there had been one on offer, she pulled it over her naked body. It felt rough to her skin already sensitive from the cold water. Eagerly she followed him wanting at long last to have the gag removed. 

 "You will not speak until spoken to. You will say 'yes sir' immediately. Do you understand? When you have eaten we will talk, until then you will remain silent. One word and the gag goes right back on. Understood?" He told her. 

 Again she nodded. Sitting before the food her head was bent almost in to it as he undid the gag only then did she realise how hungry she had become. It didn't matter that it was a simple steak and fries she was ravenous. Working a stiff jaw around to regain its use she decided to do as ordered and eat first, talk later. It wasn't worth taking a chance. 

 Marched to his office she stood waiting while he looked through a file she assumed contained the email about her stepdaughter. "Do you know why you are here?" He asked. 

 At last she could explain. "Yes, Sir!" She responded smartly. "It's a mistake." She began. He sat back in the chair with a look of resignation telling her he had heard it all before. "I'm not Libby I'm my mum I mean I'm Sophie." She blurted out in one long breath of frustration expecting him to stop her. "Its all a mistake I shouldn't be here my daughter was supposed to be here not me." She stopped speaking seeing his frown of disbelief, not knowing what more she could say. "Why, oh, why, hadn't she thought it through more clearly." She wondered why after all the time she had to prepare all she had done was ramble unintelligibly. 

 "Well I've heard it all but that is a new line young lady. I guess we had better make a call. Get some reality here." He stabbed the keys reading each digit from the email. 

 Passing the phone to her she heard Libby's drowsy voice answer the phone. The contact with home became so important she hardly dared to take a breath in case Libby slammed the phone down upon her. "No, listen. Just listen will you. Don't hang up. Please." In halting sentences she tried to explain the situation. She didn't know where she was but tried to explain it was a training camp and it was Libby that should be hear not her. "Please just tell him I'm you will you." It all came out wrong but she didn't think it mattered what she said Libby was still hung over. All that was needed was for him to talk to her and he would realise what had gone wrong. In exasperation she handed him the phone. 

 "How are you Mrs Howarth? Libby has been telling me she shouldn't be here but they all say that. It's going to be rough for a few weeks for her but I can assure you she will be returned a new person. The new Libby will be a well- behaved young lady willing to abide by your rules of the house. With experience from the many young people trained here over the years I can tell you she will be a perfect daughter. Yes. That's right. She'll be here until completely, well, until she learns to behave as a young daughter should. OK. All the best, goodbye, Mrs Howarth." 

 He put the phone down gently glad to escape from the voice at the other end. "She seemed hung over does she drink much?" The trainer asked. 

 Sophie nodded absently with a mind numbed in shock. 

 "Well that explains your drinking too much. Like mother like daughter." He said. 

 Taking a deep breath to protest she was cut short before a word left her lips at the sight of the gag in his hand. "Remember. You do as I say and you will get out of here, quick or slow. It's up to you. The sooner you learn the sooner you go home." Her face turned a paler white with frustration realising she was being gagged what ever happened. Her fists tightened at her sides as she ground her teeth, she almost stamped a foot. "I dare say you're not as bad as you've been painted. There's no one around for you to get into trouble with. I reckon we will make good quick progress. I guess a few weeks away from your mother will do you good." He watched thoughts cross her face wishing yet again he could read minds. What was she planning? She would have to be watched carefully. 

 Doing as she was told was going to get her out of there so that is exactly what she reluctantly planned to do, with the carefully nurtured incentive that this was a rest from the tormentor, Libby. At first he was suspicious at how easy she was taking the regime of hard work, as she obviously wasn't used to even boiling an egg. Nevertheless he pushed her hard and stuck to the usual routine. At night after a long day he secured her in the room, as he too had to sleep. During the day she obeyed every command with the occasional mistake to which she submitted to a punishment detail or gave up hard earned privileges. 

 The first morning she had been detailed to cook breakfast and hadn't thought she was so inept but had purposely burnt it. "Spoiling food is a shame. Do you want to lose a privilege or receive a punishment?" He asked. 

 Not wanting to lose the newly earned and sole possession, a bottle of shampoo, she replied. "Punishment, sir." 

 Without thinking about it too much he pulled her over his knee and slapped her bottom. The short shapeless shift revealed her bare arse for a loud slap. It wasn't hard but a couple more stung, reddening her cheeks. It wasn't something he would ordinarily do but there had been little of her behaviour that gave an opportunity for a reprimand. Concerned she might walk away unchanged back to the usual behaviour riled him with the thought of failure. He would have to go hard on her to get through this pretence of obedience. When she stood up she rubbed her bottom yet still didn't protest or act out. Perhaps he had overreacted, for it suddenly seemed inappropriate as he reminded himself she was twenty years old not some young teenager. Still, she was here for a reason and when she left this place she would be a well-behaved individual. 

 For six weeks he pushed her hard until she would obey almost before he gave the order. Sometimes it was the fact of not having to take responsibility for anything or anyone that drove young people into delinquency or maybe they were just mean. The trainer didn't care what it was he only knew this one was ready to go home. He was tired of this place and needed a break so right there and then he decided to drive her home. 

 It was dark by the time they arrived and as usual there was no conversation except to give orders. In the driveway he turned the panel van keeping an eye on her until the front door was opened. He drove away not wishing to meet the rich bitch that opened the door or perhaps it was a servant, either way he had been paid and was longing to go fishing. 

 "Well your back!" Libby exclaimed. After the strange phone call six weeks ago she had broken into her mothers computer and read the emails. At first she had been livid at the idea this woman had the gall to make this secret arrangement for her to be incarcerated into a training camp for wayward teenagers. Reading the weekly reports from the trainer with glee; imagining her mother having to shower in cold water, chop wood, cook, clean and all the other detailed menial tasks had been a sweet revenge. 

 He had even reported putting her over his knee; being an honest man. This had been such a deliriously entertaining idea she had to share it with friends. The report had recommended keeping the young woman on a strict reign keeping the regime up as much as possible in case she slipped into bad habits again. Libby had re-read each report finding it fascinating that all this had been planned for her. Friends pointed out that having an obedient mother would be a great convenience that must be taken advantage of. They suggested parties and an unlimited allowance but she had told them to hold off until they saw what happened on her return. 

 "Yes, sir." Sophie replied automatically. Hardly daring to think the reports were true Libby was determined to test her out. The maid and gardener had been given time off leaving space to experiment with this new relationship. "I want to eat. You had better prepare something." She ordered. The meal was simple but it didn't mater Libby was on a high drunk with power. "Fetch me a drink." Whatever she said all her mother would do was say, "Yes, Sir." Libby decided to change that. "You will call me mistress." After a couple of drinks she wondered what to do with this new slave as she stood waiting eager to please. "My shoes need cleaning." She said for nothing better came to mind. It was a surprise that she hadn't taken them away rather she knelt at her feet polishing them with the hem of the white skirt. "You can stay there." So Sophie spent the evening fetching and carrying out errands or kneeling at Libby's feet. 

 Next morning Libby felt like a child at Christmas wanting to play with a new toy. Uncharacteristically she was up early enough to catch Sophie looking through her wardrobe. "That's OK. I'll choose something for you to wear." She told her. Sophie remembered last night with shame but after a good night's sleep the spell had been broken and she gathered enough confidence to speak out. 

 "I don't think." She began. 

 "That's right you don't." Libby rounded on her. "What do you think my father would have said about what you had planned for me? Being kidnapped and treated like that. If he could read those reports what would he think of you then? Did you enjoy bending over that man's knee having your bare arse spanked?" Libby produced a ball gag from her dressing gown pocket holding it up in Sophie's face. "Any more from you and you'll be wearing this." She said, bristling with indignation. 

 Sophie bent her head, all she could say was, "Yes, mistress." Her eyes had been as wide open as her mouth in astonishment then tightly shut with fear. Perhaps she could bare this until Libby became bored with the game. After all what did she expect? At least they were spending time together and she hadn't actually kicked off as usual. Until the effects of that strict training wore off it seemed easier to just go along with this unexpected discomfort.

"I like that gown. It's pure silk isn't it? Take it off. The underwear too." Libby felt she was towering over the woman hunched over subdued, seeming to shrink down all the more at being naked. Casually looking through the wardrobe she tried to think what would be suitable for this humble servant. Something demeaning was needed to keep her in place. It suddenly occurred to her. "Of course, what you need, its obvious, a cheap nylon maids uniform. "Follow me." On the floor above were attic rooms furnished for the maid but at the foot of the stairs she stopped. The young woman strode purposefully back to her room with Sophie scurrying behind anxious to have something to cover her naked body. Disappearing into her own walk in wardrobe she began rummaging for something. With a grin spread across her face Libby found it abandoned and forgotten, emerging triumphant with a crumpled piece of material. "This will do for you." She said, dropping it at Sophie's feet. 

 Pulling it into shape she found it was a child's nurse's outfit consisting of a cotton dress with a little cap and apron. Libby was busy cutting off a red cross from the apron and cap. The dress was a tight fit but she had lost some weight while away and managed to squeeze into it. The material was thin but gave a little. While she tied on the apron and fitted the cap into her hair Libby rummaged for something else. Black stockings were an obvious accessory and a pair of little girls' frilly white knickers too. Attempting to roll the tight dress up her thighs to get the knickers on Libby became impatient. "Stop it you'll split the dress. They'll show through anyway. I can't wait all day. Come on I want my breakfast." The dress would have been difficult to walk in with it hugging her body like a sheath but it was so short it hardly covered her thighs. As much as it hugged her bottom so to her breasts were tightly embraced, squashed up into a deep cleavage ready to pop out. There didn't seem to be room for underwear and none was offered anyway. 

 Being served breakfast by Sophie in this ridiculous get-up satisfied Libby more than the first idea of a maids overall. Having her clean the kitchen and perform every menial task thought of, was satisfying, but she wondered what else to do with her. The front door bell chimed and before she could tell her to see who it was she noticed the look on Sophie's face. Dressed, as she was, the thought of someone seeing her brought out a look of dire dread. It was so amusing to see the imploring expression that she couldn't resist. 

 "Off you go. It won't be anyone you know, you don't have any friends around here." She said, rubbing it in that there would be no saviour to this ill treatment. Walking back into the dinning room ahead of three young people the embarrassment was richly etched upon a stricken face. "Hi. Dawn, Paul. Nice to see you and you too Ricky." They stared at Sophie until she left the dinning room when they grouped around Libby with exited grins on their faces. "Don't say a word. Just try and act casual. OK! Just don't call her Mrs Howarth or mother!" She whispered. They giggled attempting to suppress their laughter trying to calm down. 

 "What do you call her then?" Dawn asked. 

 Libby was stumped for a moment. "I hadn't thought of that. I just order her around." Again they laughed and wondered if she could hear them. "Have you had breakfast? It doesn't matter I just want to show her off." Libby told them. She went to fetch her new toy eager to show it off. Behind her Sophie meekly followed dreading what was to come. They ordered cool drinks vying with each other to think up something that took the most effort for their servant to prepare. The dress was riding up as she fetched and carried each time the young men wondered if her nipples would pop out as she tugged at the hem. The thin material revealed the outline of her body clearly showing she wore no underwear, especially when passing through the light streaming through the French doors. The young men appreciated the outfit and Libby was put out that she was losing their attention. 

 When their obedient servant splashed a fresh fruit cocktail over Paul, Libby reprimanded her severally. Eager to make amends she quickly bent to the task of rubbing his trousers with a napkin, which he obviously enjoyed with the amusement spreading a contorted look of pleasure across his face. From where Ricky was sitting he couldn't help but see up her dress with his face turning red with embarrassment though he carried on staring mesmerised at the sight of her nakedness. Every time she bent forward he had a glimpse of swollen lips pushing between her thighs. "What do you think you're doing?" Ricky looked away embarrassed as Libby came over to them. "Not you Ricky. This slut. Look at you. Slut!" Libby fumed. "You need to be punished for that exhibition. Do you remember the punishment you received from your trainer?" Libby asked. 

 Sophie furtively looked around the room intuitively knowing they too had read those humiliating reports from the trainer. So now she knew why they had so easily taken part in the abuse. She just couldn't bring herself to say a word in defence while all the time nervously pulling at the back of the dress trying to cover up the thoughtless action of revealing herself to Ricky. It had been so foolish to bend over Paul but couldn't stop from rubbing him or think of anything but pleasing him, making amends for the mistake. The training had been as good as the trainer promised. 

 Looking at Libby she pleaded with her eyes not daring to speak. Her face plainly revealed she knew what was being suggested and it was plain she wanted to say, "Please, not here, not now!" Wanting to appease Libby she simply answered. "Yes, mistress." 

 "What was the punishment?" 

 "Spanked, mistress." She said quietly. 

 "Speak up. What was your punishment, slut?" Libby asked, enjoying the obvious anguish of her mother squirming before her and her friends. 

 "I was spanked, mistress." Wanting to appease her, Sophie was willing to bear the shame and say anything, however embarrassing, just so it would stop, allowing her to slink back to the kitchen. 

 "So what is your punishment to be now?" Libby goaded her. 

 About to yell out in protest she bit her lip. "A spanking mistress." With Libby prodding her back she slowly slipped over Paul's lap until she could feel his bulge throbbing tight against her belly. The little dress was up over her hips revealing everything to them all. Wanting it to be over with she felt the seconds agonisingly filled with the pain of disgrace. Paul was unsure but with Libby gesturing silently to him with hearty air slaps he lifted his hand for a testing swipe at the naked bottom posed before him. The sound was a proper thwack filling the silent room with its strangeness. The second was more confident and stung his hand, which he guessed, her too. By the time he had assumed some confidence it was over. His hand had come temptingly close to touching her between the legs only everyone was intently watching every stroke. 

 Thankful it was over she stood pulling at the hem of the little dress. Paul noticed her hard nipples staring back at him through the thin fabric, which was being stretched over them each time she pulled at it. "Ricky now." Libby demanded. Demurring from this new threat she backed way having assumed that was it. The word 'why' hung between them, after all hadn't she already been punished, it wasn't fair. "For showing yourself off to Ricky like a slut. Over." She said, pointing to the waiting lap. 

 Ricky needed no further prompting; he slapped the bare cheeks ignoring his stinging hand relishing the marks on her bottom. Too much Libby thought and called it enough. Before she slipped off his lap he managed to slide his fingers across her swollen lips hoping no one noticed. 

 "Now come here." Libby demanded. Without another word she pulled the errant servant over her lap and spanked the already red cheeks. Her mother squirmed more in shame than pain. "That's for letting me down in front of my guests. In future you will be an obedient and careful servant. Get another drink for Paul. No don't pull your dress down leave it where it is. We will all be reminded of your stupid behaviour and you will be too." Libby ordered her. They admired her red bottom as she ran from the room. 

 "Wow!" Ricky exclaimed. "I've just spanked Mrs Howarth's bottom." They laughed nervously not expecting the game to go that far but it did conclusively prove Libby had her under control as the trainers report had promised. 

 "Well, it's weird for me too. I had never imagined spanking my mom." Libby admitted with a shrug. "This is revenge for all those times we were grounded or made to do stuff. We can all get our own back on parents through her." Libby told them. They nodded thoughtfully though the guys were thinking of something completely different form the girls. They would like to take it out on her all right. 

 Paul sat in shock quietly contemplating what he had just done, then spoke up. "It looks as though you've found her a name. Slut." He explained, to their blank looks. 

 Dawn had silently encouraged them but now she broke in. "Did you notice how excited she was? Slut seems appropriate." Libby looked at her a moment then it occurred to her too. It was obvious. She hadn't noticed, being distracted by the sheer audacity of what they had done to her. When she returned with a drink they keenly looked over her body only now noticing the hairs between her legs glistening and her nipples pointing hard through the thin fabric. "You're a lewd slut." Libby commented gleefully. "I've decided from now on your name will be Slut. What do you say to that, Slut?" 

 "Yes mistress." Sophie quavered. 

 "What is your name, tell me." 

 "My name is Slut, mistress." Sophie replied with a suppressed sob. So they had guessed at how excited she had become by all this attention to her body. It had been so long since having sex she had unknowingly grown frustrated. Suddenly her mind and body had been bombarded with overwhelming feelings from their teasing and furtive touching so now it was impossible to control her body's natural or maybe unnatural reaction. Woefully she felt it an appropriate name bringing home the state she had been reduced to. 

 With Libby's mother walking around bare assed the lad's conversation lapsed every time she entered the room so Libby decided to do something about it. She had caught sight of Ricky furtively sliding his hand between her thighs but said nothing wondering what to do about it. Strangely Sophie hadn't flinched from him or indicated anything was amiss. "OK. Lets see if we can find something for this Slut to wear. It will be like playing at dressing our dolls like we used to." Libby said with a snigger. The lads were delighted on realising they were to be included, like teenagers excited at the prospect of a daring illicit game. Off they went upstairs chattering to each other heading for the bedrooms with Sophie in tow and Ricky following keenly watching every movement of her bottom. 

 At first she had thought there was to be some respite to the assault upon her body having heard she was going to be dressed but the humiliation continued. Standing naked before the young men while the young women argued over how to dress her left her feeling more aroused bringing with it a deeper shame. The way the lads were looking at her body it was important Libby got this game out of her system as quickly as possible. Their relationship could return to the usual stand off with neither intruding into the others life and she could put this stupid episode behind her. Until then she would have to endure the torment, after all it was her fault she was in this predicament. 

 Her hair was spiked with gel, the make-up a heavy black with a false safety pin through one nostril to complete a Goth look. A bin bag from the kitchen was serving as a dress tightly revealing every curve of her body. The girls could see it would be a torture for her not to wear underwear leaving her looking as lascivious as before. A pair of black platform shoes left her wobbling with every step to the car. A visit to the mall for a shopping trip with her daughter hadn't been dreamed of especially this nightmare trip. Shoppers were avoiding looking at her though some couldn't help themselves. At least no one would recognise her under the lavish make up, it was as though she could display herself while in disguise. With all responsibility stripped away she felt free to recklessly exhibit her body in this familiar public place. 

 "Hi, guys." Libby greeted a group of rough looking teens. Strolling through the mall was one thing but being confronted with a bunch of wild looking teenagers brought the danger of the situation into stark reality. How should she react? She couldn't expect them to treat her like a responsible parent looking like this so what could she do if they got out of hand? "This is my cousin." Her daughter had introduced her as 'Slut' to which she nervously smiled just in time refraining from offering them her hand to shake. They nodded and grunted attempting to take her sensuous look casually, not quite succeeding. 

 The leader of their gang had to reassert him self, telling her. "You seem pleased to see me." He said, looking directly at the engorged nipples stretching at thin black plastic to almost breaking point. They laughed and gathered round for a closer look making out to pinch them with ribald remarks until a nudge pushed a hand onto her breast. Unable to step away in the awkward shoes they took advantage of her confusion to pinch and squeeze them pushing Sophie to the limit of endurance unable to believe what was happening. Right there in a public mall where she had once calmly shopped these young men were mauling her body. 

 Libby intervened, telling them, "I told you her name was Slut and it suits her don't you think." They laughed loudly with more suggestions as to how she could live up to the name. One of them suggested she join them as their gang slut. "I'm sure she'd love to." Libby said without a trace of humour. 

 Sophie near fainted at the thought of her daughter giving her away to these rough looking teenagers. They became more emboldened by their own excitement. Paul caught her but couldn't prevent her sliding to the floor where she bumped her bare bottom. "What a hairy bush you have Slut." One of them said, which at least kept the rabble quiet for a moment while Paul lifted her to her feet. Ricky at last responded by taking hold of one arm then pushing at them telling them to leave her alone. A tussle for possession started with the younger men winning leaving her winded amongst scrabbling hands and arms being slowly dragged deeper into their group. 

 The fear of being hauled away to their lair like some trophy was real, made all the more serious being named Slut. They already expected her to live up to the name. One of them cupped her bare bottom in his hand a finger crawling closer to her hole. Desperately needing to pull away she found it impossible to move without falling off the high platform shoes. Then it occurred to her it was the training that held her back. These young men would order her around like a slut and she would obey. She looked at Sophie with a pitiful look, a tear decorating one cheek. 

 A security guard appeared out of nowhere parting them like Moses, telling them to move on. "I might have guessed a female would be the cause of trouble. Get off home before I call the cops." He told the gang. Taking in the expensive clothing and jewellery of Libby and her friends, he told them, "Get off home you four. Your parents won't want to see you taken home by the cops. You kids! I guess your parents wouldn't give a damn but I do. Whatever your up to, do it somewhere else. And take trouble with you." 

 "My god!" Sophie thought. "I've been ordered away with these delinquents." 

 Libby spoke up emphasising her classy accent. "She's with us." 

 "Is she really with you?" The security guard took a hold of Sophie's arm. "Well, don't hang out with that rabble. You get home and get some clothes on. You do as this girl tells you or your be in trouble." 

 "Oh! Thank you Mistress. I promise to behave." Sophie gushed. "I'm so sorry." She apologised, still in shock from the gangs' molestation and her stimulation to it. Thankfully they had been oblivious to her excitement. 

 The group laughed at the sincerity of Libby's mother scrabbling to please. The black plastic bag dress was now ripped leaving even less to the imagination while she scrabbled to hold it together. Trembling with thoughts of what might have happened if he hadn't intervened she kept close to them walking through the mall. In a quiet corner by the entrance to the parking lot a grimy storefront loomed up before Sophie. She hadn't managed to calm herself enough to hear their mischievous conversations so missed what was in store next. 

 "Hi, Judy. Yah! Long time no see. She could do with your special beauty treatment. A facial, the works, give her a treat. OK!" Led away to a cubicle she was told to strip off what remained of the bin bag. The hefty woman gave no option but to do as she was told though it sounded as though she was at last being given a treat after all that mistreatment. She had always enjoyed being pampered at a beauty salon and although the paper towel over the massage table was less than she was used to the woman's strong arms looked business like. On seeing the only garment she had screwed up in disgust and dropped into a bin by the woman hardly mattered for the girls had said they would be back from shopping to collect her. Perhaps the scary gang had sobered Libby up to become more responsible and would return with something respectable. 

 The pain was a sharp unexpected shock opening her eyes wide from what she had thought was a light trim of her pubic hair. She had clamped her eyes shut in embarrassment when the woman, without a word of explanation, had started to trim the hair between her legs. Never having experienced a wax treatment she was totally unprepared. So the torture was to continue. 

 "Judy I'm back. How's it going? Well look at that. I bet that hurt." Libby laughed smugly. "We couldn't decide what to get or what size she is so we'll have to take her for a tour of the mall. Where's her dress?" 

 It was held up between Judy's fingers in an arm outstretched to indicate its offensiveness, having become nothing but a scrap of crumpled plastic. Sophie looked at it flutter back into the rubbish with a look of disbelief that not only had she lost this inadequate covering she was without even her pubic hair for protection. What humiliation was she to suffer next? Was she expected to walk around the mall completely naked without even a hair as a shield? Libby silently pointed to a photo pinned to the wall while looking Judy in the eye for them to share a knowing smile. The woman's beloved artistic skill was in demand. 

 In trepidation Sophie only just let them shepherd her out of the store with the promise they weren't going to tour the mall for clothes after all. Catching sight of her body in the smoky glass of the storefront she almost believed she was dressed. The body paint presented the illusion that she was dressed in a black leotard with a shirt over it. It was funny to think she looked more decently dressed than when in the bin bag while now she was completely naked with even her nether lips bare. Her hair had been washed out and the make up was almost normal. When they pulled up in the old down town area of nightclubs Libby had to pull on a nipple to get her out of the car. It was dark but walking the streets naked was pushing her too far. Libby and her friends didn't think so. Keeping her head bowed not wanting to see if anyone noticed how vulnerable she was it suddenly occurred to her the others weren't around. Frantically looking up and down the street she saw them leaning out the car laughing at her, a block away on the other side of the street. To get back to what little security they provided in the car, she would have to cross in the full glare of headlights and street lamps.

Taking a closer look at the surroundings she let out a whimper. "No! You evil devils!" On both sides of the street were hookers parading, trawling for men. Before she could move back into the shadows she was dazzled when caught in the glaring headlights of a cruising car. Not seeing them but hearing the raucous shouts it was obviously a bawdy group of men, out on the town worse for wear, even this early in the evening. From the comments she learnt that not only had her daughter betrayed her but so had her body. The body paint had been applied well but her labia had opened up to display a clearly contrasting pink colour. The nipples had grown out through the paint with a matching redness commented on by the rough men in embarrassing detail. She watched as though it were a movie unable to comprehend the appalling reality of these strangers leaning from the convertible meaning to haul her aboard. They thought she was just another hooker audaciously naked, obviously ready for anything. 

 The two young men grabbed her arms and swung her away into their car idling behind the convertible, where she fell arse up onto the back seat. Teased all day, sacrificed to strangers, until at the last moment her tormentors had saved her, she collapsed from the overpowering torrent of emotion. It was a shock that the building sexual tension had left her wanting to be taken away by those strangers. 

 "Did you see that?" Dawn exclaimed, as Libby turned the car sharply to speed off in the opposite direction. "The Slut stepped toward them. She was actually going to go off with them." Ricky wasn't listening to the expressions of disgust rippling between the two girls up front, for over his lap he had a naked woman glistening wet with excitement. Paul was completely oblivious to anything else while engrossed in the feel of her breasts, alternately pinching the nipples and cupping both tits hanging down into his hands. 

 Ricky had explored the female form before, furtively under a skirt in the dark, though never like this in plain view. Probing inexpertly he delved into soft flesh eliciting an occasional murmur of approval until learning how to maintain a constant sound of pleasurable moaning from the prone woman. It wasn't far to the Howarth residence but Mrs Howarth had reached her journey's end, for at last she had come after a day of sensual torment. Ricky wiped his sticky fingers in her hair being considerate enough not to stain the Mercedes upholstery or his expensive clothes. Sophie brought herself together on hearing the crunch of tyres on gravel knowing this was home and safety, almost. The humiliation of having these young men fondling her and bringing her to an orgasm was bad enough but knowing how much she had needed it was too much to bear. She scrabbled from their laps eager to reach the relative security of her home. 

 Before Sophie could scurry away upstairs she was brought to a halt. "Stop right there, Slut!" Sophie bellowed. "You are just a shameful whore. Just look at you." Made to stand before them she hung her head in shame. The other three laughed at her state of excitement, partly in embarrassment, for the lads knew they had contributed to it and hoped they wouldn't be found out. "What were you doing behind my back?" Libby was looking at the smudged body paint almost erased from both breasts as well as between her legs. Sophie felt a slight stickiness between her thighs and groaned. How could they make her stand there naked while talking about her body so horribly? "It's obvious what you guys have been doing to her. From now on no touching, OK! You can look but don't touch. Guy's for pity sake you can't finger fuck my mom. It's just not right." Sophie was weak with shock for it was right she had become so depraved as to let her daughter's friends play with her body. It didn't matter that they had driven her to desperation, it was just so wrong. 

 Libby kept her mother on a tight reign all week, as advised by the trainer, to keep her in the state of submission she had been reduced to. Keeping her out of the way when anyone called, when the gardener or pool man was around, she managed to keep the secret of possessing her own mother as a servant. The maid was paid off for Libby kept her mother busy all the while with chores, which she gradually learnt to competently complete under the threat of a spanking. On spoiling a meal or missing something she would find herself over her daughters knee, which was incentive enough to do as she was told. 

 To keep her friends in on the game she would allow the lads to spank her and ignored their surreptitious fondling of the new maid. Dawn enjoyed having the one time parent fetching and carrying for her too. It was convenient to have her phone parents with the excuse they were staying over when they toured the clubs into the early hours. Everything seemed to be working out well. The checks were signed and Libby now had her mothers allowance from the estate as well as her own to play with. 

 "Dawn guess what!" Libby squealed with delight. "John has asked me to his parents beach house for a couple of weeks. No! They won't be there. It'll be just us two and a few friends. Guys and their girlfriends! You know what that means don't you? He wants me to be his girlfriend." Libby gushed. Dawn was a little jealous that she hadn't been invited and that it was John of all people. They both had a crush on him in school but then who hadn't. 

 "What are you going to do with her?" Dawn asked. "You can hardly take your mom along with you." 

 Libby let out a groan. Having someone dependent upon you had become a nuisance over the last few weeks. If she had thought about it the role reversal would have been poignant to their relationship, having learnt some responsibility over the past few weeks. Libby looked at Dawn. "Please! Oh go on. You can do it you'll have fun. You know you enjoy ordering her around." Libby implored of her friend. 

 Dawn looked at Sophie and asked. "Will you obey me while she is gone?" 

 Sophie had stood quietly trying not to attract attention. As usual dressed in a rough nylon maids overall, without underwear, leaving her feeling vulnerable to their criticism and punishment. This was the first Sophie had heard about this and was so pleased to hear her tormentor was about to leave she would agree to anything. "Yes mistress." She replied without hesitation. 

 "You had better do as you are told or there will be trouble when I return. Do you understand, Slut?" Libby growled at her. 

 "Yes mistress." She replied dutifully, hiding her face from the two young women in case they read her thoughts. With only Dawn here she would have a chance to shake off this ridiculous subservient demeanour. Without Libby's continuous reinforcement of that intense training regime it wouldn't take long to get back to normal. "Oh what a surprise you are in store for young lady." She thought, trying hard not to reveal upon her face the glee she felt. 

 With last minute instructions and a list of chores, Libby sounded like a housewife leaving her child with a neighbour. Sophie just stood with head bowed feeling inadequate as her daughter reeled off directions for her care as though she weren't there. "Just go will you!" Dawn told her. "I'll look after everything. Have a good time with John." 

 "One more thing. Don't let her out of your sight, especially when the boys are around. I don't want to come home to find my mom pregnant!" Libby told her. The serious frown turned to laughter as they both realised how outrageous it sounded. On leaving the house she put all such worries behind her and set off for the beach with nothing more than the clothes she wore and a bikini. 

 Taking a deep breath Sophie prepared to declare some rules upon this unwelcome house sitter, rather different from those enjoyed recently by the young harridan. After all she had better make it clear from the beginning she ruled here. It was her home and she was the adult responsible for it. 

 Before she could make a sound Dawn poked her with a finger saying. "You heard what she said, Slut. You will do as your told, as promised! You will be punished for mistakes, think on that. Don't think you're in for an easy time, Slut. I'm in charge now so hop to it when I speak. Do you understand?" Dawn said, bombarding Sophie with words with the force of a cold shower. 

 Sophie shuddered under the force of emotional language caving in, submitting completely, to buy time. All she could do was reply as trained, "Yes, mistress." 

 "Get me a drink and a sandwich. Hop to it, Slut." Dawn shouted in her ear. As Sophie turned Dawn slapped her arse as an incentive. "Some of those bacon flavoured chips too." She added to the scurrying servant. 

 In the kitchen Sophie was busy preparing a quick meal holding back tears welling in her delicate hazel eyes, hardly able to see what she was doing. All ideas of escape had evaporated on finding the training had become more ingrained than anticipated. Instead of making her own demands she had capitulated completely to Dawn's fierce onslaught. Tidying herself before entering the dining room she dutifully carried the tray careful not to spill anything. Watching Dawn consume the snack provided a moment of reflection. If this young woman so easily brought her to such a sate of submission did it mean she was as vulnerable to the two lads? Was this what her daughter had meant by needing to be watched? Remembering how naughty she had been in the back of the car a week ago left her shivering. If Dawn left her with those two would Sophie's scandalous prediction come to pass? It didn't bear thinking about. She desperately needed protection even if it meant bowing and scraping to this young woman until her daughter returned. 

 Next day Sophie paid careful attention to Dawn's demands yet still found her self being chastised. "That overall needs changing. Follow me Slut." Dawn said. Wearing a little skirt and top without underwear was more embarrassing as it made her look and feel even more like a young sister, not the mature woman she had been a few weeks ago. When the doorbell chimed she dreaded opening it to the two young men knowing they would take full advantage of her daughters absence. To her surprise they sent her to her room where she sat wondering what they were planning hoping it wouldn't involve her. 

 Sounds of activity reached her from down stairs, which surely couldn't mean they were throwing a party, as they would have made her do all the work. Soon she was to find out when Dawn entered the room. "We are having a visitor. No one you know. You will do as you're told as usual, Slut. Just in case you have an idea of escape or wriggling out of here this will remind you I'm in charge." Dawn said, waving an evil looking cane around. "Bend over Slut." She said. 

 "No Dawn, please. I'll be good, honest. I'll do exactly as I'm told." Sophie pleaded. There was the sound of the cane thrashing her cheeks, once, twice then nothing. She had expected more, was this hesitation part of the torment. 

 "Now listen carefully. This is what you will do." Dawn said. 

 Summoned into the lounge she immediately noticed a stranger sitting and talking with Dawn. No sign of the lads. Embarrassed that a complete stranger should be included into this sorry game she kept her head down wishing it to be over as quickly as possible. "This is Barbie, Mister Roberts. Say hello, Barbie." Dawn said. 

 "Hello, Sir." She said. 

 "Your cousin has told me your father wants you to learn to play the piano. She has also told me you are a rather wilful young woman. It is better to get it right from the beginning so I must tell you I don't take nonsense from anyone. You are here to learn and I am here to teach. Lets get started." The teacher told her. Inwardly she groaned for here was yet another strong character determined to dominate her. Perhaps she would have been better off left with the lads after all. 

 "What's the matter?" He asked. "Sit down and lets get started." 

 "I can't sir." Sophie complained. 

 "What's wrong with you girl?" He said, already showing impatience. 

 "I'm afraid she's been caned Mister Roberts. Her father is very strict." Dawn volunteered. 

 "Well she can't play standing up." He said. . "Here's some ointment, perhaps that will help." Dawn offered. On cue Sophie bent over his knee where upon the teacher jumped almost shaking her off his lap. Instinctively he prevented her rolling onto the floor with a hand grabbing a bare cheek. 

 "I can't do that." He said, all the while looking down at her bare arse. 

 "Please, sir. It stings." Sophie said, hoping to sound pathetic and genuine enough to please Dawn. He hesitated a moment until reassured by both women. He attentively applied a little of the cream. "That feels better already." She cooed. He had little choice looking down at her smooth white cheeks but to rub it in, his hands working deeper of their own accord. Encouraging the movements with little moans they became more erotic as he found the magic button. There was no need to act she came noisily arching her back for more of his fingers. 

 Sophie slipped off his knees to scurry away in shame back to her room. Dawn brought Mister Roberts a large cold Scotch on the rocks, which he accepted in a shaking hand, gulping it down in one. "You had better take a look at this Mister Roberts." Dawn said. The large screen television showed in stark detail Sophie bending over his lap legs spreading wider as fingers manipulated her soft cheeks. Mesmerised by the image, hardly noticing the rapt attention playing upon his own face, he watched unable to keep up with these fast changing circumstances. 

 Dawn handed him another drink still careful to keep out of shot for the lads were still videoing him with a hidden camera. Waiting for it to sink in she was amused at the expressions crossing his face from sexual tension to shock now fear. "What have you done? Why?" He asked. The picture went black. 

 "The video will be carefully edited and distributed to, well, lets think." She teased watching his mouth working like a gold fish, unable to find words. "Your family, friends, neighbours, colleagues, boss. Will that list make you pay attention?" She said emphasising the word pay. 

 "I'll, I'll." He said. Not finding anything to say he threw the second Scotch down his throat. 

 Dawn didn't laugh wanting to preserve the seriousness of the atmosphere, wanting to punish. He had forced her to play the piano every Saturday and Sunday for months and here she was at last in a position of power over him. Money wasn't what she wanted but that would be a start until the rest had been thought through. As she shut the door upon his retreating back she shouted, "I'll be in touch." 

 Libby flounced into the lounge loudly complaining, "That was a complete disaster! He only had me there to make his latest girlfriend jealous. Your looking moody what's up? Get Slut I need to take it out on someone. Mind you I played a little subversion myself. The bitch won't be speaking to him again. Where's Slut?" 

 Dawn looked dolefully at her friend handing her a note. Libby was silent and still for once. "We went out. I, we were bored. We went to a club. I tied Slut to the bed before we went. How was I to know this would happen?" Dawn said, waiting for her friend to explode upon her with fierce words. 

 "You left her alone. How could you? I told you to watch her, to look after her. She's been kidnapped. My mom is out there somewhere with strangers, helpless. Who knows what they are doing to her." Dawn said. Clenching the note tight in both fists she asked. "What's this about a video tape?" 

 "They want me to bring the video. The one the guys and me made. I guess they mean to exchange it for her." Dawn said in a gush. Dawn slowly turned staring at her with a cruel mean look. Dawn haltingly explained the trick they had played on the music teacher. 

 "I can't trust you to make the swap. Hell knows what they're getting her to do. In that state she can't refuse anything. You've seen that. I've got to get her back." Libby said, staring intently at the piece of paper. It was her mom who signed the cheques so there was a practical reason apart from a sense of responsibility she had acquired over the last few weeks. What would happen if her mother mysteriously disappeared with her as sole beneficiary to the estate? A lot of awkward questions would be asked with nothing but embarrassing answers. "I've got to get her back. Where is that tape?" 

 Dawn plunged her hand down the back of the sofa pulling it out. Displaying a pallid smile she hoped it was in some way placating her friend. 

 "So where are the guys?" She asked. 

 "Oh. They disappeared off home last night. They saw nothing of that note, just the tape." Dawn said. 

 Libby was too furious to be afraid as she drove out to an unknown address, alone. In the mailbox was another note detailing another address, this one out in the country. Pulling up outside a large old-fashioned ranch house furry took her onto the front porch and up to the front door. Hearing heavy footsteps approaching she became nervous. Alone in the middle of nowhere it became obvious how reckless she had been. 

 "Come in." The tall man said. 

 Anger reasserting itself she stepped in demanding an answer, she said. "What have you done with her? She had better be OK!" She followed the silent man into a study. It's maleness shouted from the walls decorated with dead animals, cigar smoke drifted in the sunlight. 

 "Stand there." He said. Sitting heavily into a leather captain's chair behind a large oak desk he looked her up and down disdainfully. "You have the tape?" 

 "No! It's somewhere safe." She said clutching her bag close to her body. 

 He didn't miss the movement as well as noticing she was unaware of it. "I could do whatever I like with her. Would you care? You seem to have mistreated her over the last few weeks. There's a lot of interest in an attractive young woman. A lot of men would be interested in a compliant woman, willing to please." He let the words sink in. She seemed to quiver from fear of what he was about to tell her. She knew there was more and the fear had dried her mouth. 

 "You can sell anything on the Internet these days. An obedient woman would fetch a lot of money. A great temptation! Maybe I don't need that CD." He nodded at her handbag, which she gripped tighter. "Or maybe I'll take both you and the CD. Give the tape back to the friend you cheated, sell the woman and keep you as a pet. No one knows you're here." He watched her mouth open and close leaving little gasps of breath in the air wafting cigar smoke around her. 

 

 "Please don't, it's my fault, do what you like with me, just let my mom go." She wailed with a breath abruptly exhaled. 

 "That's all lies you're not worried about her. It's you you're concerned about knowing you've walked into a difficult position and want out. She's not your mother she's your friends mother. So just tell me the truth Dawn." He barked at her. 

 Shacking with fear she tried to explain. "I'm Libby. Dawn is, was my friend. I left my mom with her and she did this." She said holding up the handbag. "I had no idea she was going to trick your friend. It's my fault for leaving her with Dawn. I'm sorry. I just want her back, please." Libby pleaded. "You can have the CD back. I'll delete everything on the computer. I won't say anything, not to anyone. Just let my mom go." Libby whimpered. Exhausted Libby sank to her knees with tears running down her cheeks. 

 The man got up form his desk and walked over to a bar. He fixed himself a drink and brought her a soft drink. Helping her up off the floor he guided her to a chair. "I see. So you are concerned. After what Sophie told me, well, I thought you were a bunch of brutes. I can see how it all went wrong. Still, you need to be punished. I think a job will sort you out young lady." He guided her to a window looking out over a field stretching to the horizon. "See that rider out there? Well that's your mother. She's been enjoying her stay here, unwinding. I must admit I feel partly responsible for what's happened. I trained her. Yes, I'm the one that sent you those reports. You seem to have gained some level of responsibility. If you agree to work in the stables I can convince your mother that some hard dirty work will repair the damage done. Agreed?"  

 

 

===

Libby was willing to agree to anything. Still not sure what was going on she slowly came round to the idea she had been outsmarted for a change. "Yes." She said. The images of her mom being sold into slavery were becoming slightly ridiculous. 

 "That's a nice smile. You can both rest up here until your relationship is repaired. She has become a passable cook and you can keep the place clean. And, at last I can go fishing. When your both ready we can talk about something more permanent. If you want to stay, that is." He said, his last words trailing off. 

 She looked up at him as he gazed out the window at her mother and saw something in those grey blue eyes. He wasn't the kind of man to reveal much and she was guessing what he meant. A funny feeling stirred her stomach. It was surprising to think this stranger was taking an interest in her mom and that it was a pleasant one. Report_Story
