Gamer Goddess Ch.01 

 by Tx Tall Tales (c) 

 ============================== 

 The Gamer Goddess meets her match. 

 This story is very online-gaming-centric. It uses a lot of concepts, vocabulary and acronyms from games, especially Diablo 3, which this story revolves around. If you're not a gamer, it's likely this story might not be for you. Just a heads-up. 

 A little gaming, online lingo: 

 IRL/RL - In Real Life / Real Life (as opposed to gaming world) 

 OP - Over Powered / Original Poster 

 IMHO - In My Humble Opinion (I feel dumb even listing this one) 

 XP - eXPerience, how you track progress in game 

 Neckbeard - Overweight, unshaven, unkempt geek with hair on his neck 

 Normal/Nightmare/Hell/Inferno - Progressively harder Diablo3 Levels 

 DPS - Damage per second, how much game damage you do 

 Portal - Game ability to teleport back to town. Takes a few seconds 

 Noob/Newbie/New Meat - New to the game, ignorant or stupid 

 Res/Rez/Resurrect - Bring a dead game character back to life 

 GTFO - Get the Fuck Out - insult for a noob or jerk to get lost 

 STFU - Shut the Fuck Up 

 Tits or GTFO - popularized in 4chan. Typical response to anonymous 'girls' 

 

 

 ============================== 

 I wasn't a socializer. I played hard and played to win. Recorded and posted some of my more interesting tactics, strategies and successes. No time for the namby pamby. I only had 11 in-game friends, turning down numerous requests a day. If I didn't know you IRL you weren't on my list. 

 Another scrolling pink message in the bottom corner of my screen was nothing special. Something to be ignored nine times out of 10. 

 

 

 Wasn't worthy of a reply. Too busy farming Inferno Act III non-stop. I picked up my second legendary in as many days. I know that would excite a lot of newbies, but 9 times out of 10, I'd prefer a good yellow drop over the infrequent orange. 

 The game had been out for over three weeks already. Playing Beta had helped me get off to a rocking start, but people were catching up. I couldn't back off now. 

 I popped out of the campaign, checking my auctions. I was well up into the 10's of millions. Maybe not the most, but doing well. The damn Chinese gold farmers would pass me before long, but that was the game. WoW had been just as bad, if not worse. Once I finished the game solo, I was going full-time hardcore anyway, and that would keep most of the bots at bay. 

 

 

 I'm sure it would be best. Pricey as hell. The Auction House held plenty. Go shop. 

 ColMustard was begging for a trip to WhimseyShire. Since I'd posted a vid of me solo'ing it at Inferno level, all my friends wanted to pay a visit. But he was better than most, and gave as good as he got. I opened up the game to take him on a tour. I was the only person I knew with the upgraded staff needed for Whimsey Inferno. It still kicked my ass. But the loot so far had been unGodly. 

 Fucker had to be res'd half a dozen times, and got me killed twice, which I hate, but it was good for about 60K in gold and two bags of loot. A kick ass shield, max block, hi armor, good crit. Should net a few 100K on the auction. 

 CherryBomb was consistent, I'll give 'em that. Not spamming me, but every few hours I'd get a request for help with gear. It was getting hard to ignore it. 

 I was leveling a new hardcore barbarian, after my accidental level 53 death the day before. Fuckin' lag. It was slower going, but I hated power-leveling through exploits. Finding some combo that was OP, that was one thing, but multiple quest turn-ins at double your level sucks IMHO. 

 PerZeus was online, and offered an invite. He played a Demon Hunter. We worked together well. I also owed him. He'd found my quiver with 9% bonus to Elemental Arrow for my own DH. 

 I joined his game and hit his banner in town. We were both almost level 50, and he wanted to run the boss's for XP before moving to Hell. 

 

 

 

 

 Shit. I hated that. Playing with someone I didn't know, especially hardcore, where if you died you lost the character for good, and everything on it. Anyone but PerZeus, or maybe GnuMeat, and I'd have left. We were standing in the stairwell, idling when the flash appeared. 

 

 

 Crap. I'd been dodging this character for three days. 

 

 

 CherryBomb was running a level 54 Monk. That was pretty impressive. A quick check of the profile was more disappointing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 I'll say this. For someone so under-geared, CherryBomb had skills. Thirty minutes became an hour and we knocked out some pretty tough elite mobs and several bosses. The loot was mediocre but this was all about the XP. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Smiley? Really? Fuckin' noob. 

 

 

 Mistake. Almost died. It was a lot harder without CherryBomb. Still, we managed to survive, and broke level 51 where the gear got better. I had a 10 level reduction two-hander that was epic. It had been used by my previous character, and had been swapped out the same day I lost him and everything on him. The only good thing on an otherwise crappy day. Doubled my damage as soon as I equipped it. The next 4-6 levels would fly by. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 shitty gear. All the cursing. I think she's mapped a different curse to every quick chat key. Probably some neckbeard in his Momma's basement pretending to be a chick 

 

 can tell 

 * * * 

 I hit level 56, and went back to my softcore account to do a little farming. Softcore was for learning. I intended to clear Inferno with every class, softcore. Hardcore was for fun. My auctions were almost all done, another 5.2 million in my account, mostly thanks to a 3.1 million ring. Needed to stock up. The economy was shifting. People had gold, and prices were going up. A couple of hours should do it. 

 I logged in and saw the new friend request. CherryBomb. 

 Denied. 

 I was building my valor stacks for improved looting when the messages started. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 of old Pizza boxes 

 

 

 

 

 

 amulets. You got a +75-80 all resist? 

 

 

 

 

 

 gear 

 

 

 

 

 That shut him up. Or so I thought. 

 

 

 This should be interesting. I escaped to menus, and alt-tabbed out. 

 Two minutes later I had Skype up, calling CherryB0mb22. The video chat window popped open. 

 Fuck. Me. 

 Not possible. She was a little hottie. Geek glasses. Ultra-tight t-shirt showing some serious assets. Headset looked like the new Astro A40. Nice. 

 "Believe me now?" she asked, smirking. 

 "Nice try. How much is he paying you to pose for him?" 

 She looked a little more than irritated. "You saying I can't play 'cause I'm a girl?" 

 "I'm saying nobody that looks like that plays Diablo 3 eight hours a day." 

 She smiled. "Kind of a backhanded compliment but I'll take it. My job is kind of hit or miss. I get a lot of free time." 

 "No, really. You a sister? Friend? Paid escort?" 

 Suddenly she wasn't so sweet looking, snarling at me. "Listen, AceHole, I game. I'm good. How about some fucking credit where it's due?" 

 "How did we meet in game?" I asked, still finding it hard to believe she was the same CherryBomb. 

 "Other than you ignoring me for 3 days, PerZeus brought me in so I could escort your weenie asses through the end of Hell." 

 I was stunned. "You're real?" 

 She smiled. She reached down and grabbed her t-shirt clad breasts, shaking them. "Tits or Get-The-Fuck-Out? These real enough for you?" 

 "I've seen neckbeard fakers with bigger." 

 She laughed with me, and it was nice to see. "Trust me. Mine are better." 

 "I'm not the trusting sort. Pics or it didn't happen." 

 She pouted prettily. "Pics aren't free. Not from the only girl on the internet." 

 "A 76 resist-all amulet, with 46 physical resist says those aren't real." 

 She grinned, raising her eyebrows cutely. "I thought they only went to 70, noob." 

 "Shows what you know. 68 All Resistance, with 84 Intelligence. 76 Resist." 

 She looked interested. "Pretty cool. I didn't think about it stacking like that. I prove they're real, I get the amulet?" 

 "They better be spectacular. It's a 2 million gold amulet." 

 "No screenshots. Eyes only. And you deliver the amulet first." 

 I knew I was being scammed. No way this was legit. It didn't stop me; tits were tits. I could make the 2 million back in a few hours. "Switching to game now. Invite me in a couple of minutes." 

 I popped back into the game. Took me about two minutes to grab the amulet out of my stash and accept her party invite. I ended up in town, with her main character. I dropped the loot on the ground. She only took a second to pick it up. 

 

 

 Hardly incredible. Secondary stats were crap except for the Int. None of the really important attributes. But the resist alone made it valuable. 

 

 

 

 Thanks. Back to Skype? 

 Forty percent? She really was playing with crap for gear. And stupid. Monk had the easiest resistance in the game with their passive skill. Surprised she made it to level 54 hardcore. 

 

 

 Skype was still up, and I switched out of the game, seeing her pecking at her keyboard. She turned to the camera suddenly looking shy. "To be honest, I thought you were going to try to scam me somehow," she said. 

 "It's the internet. I thought the same." 

 She nodded. "It's a kickin' amulet. Best gear I have by far. So much better than just the resistance." 

 "Yeah. I try to be fair. You cheat people, it comes back to bite you. Too many scammers out there. It's part of why I only friend Real-Life." 

 She smiled. "I'll be honest. I was only going to flash you, but I'd feel like a shit after this. You so over delivered." 

 "I'll be honest too. I'm still waiting to be scammed." 

 She gave me a pout. "Poor baby. So untrusting. So are you ready for me?" She had her arms crossed in front of her, holding the bottom of her t-shirt. 

 "I've got my fingers crossed, and I'm hoping I'm wrong for once." 

 She smiled, scooted forward on the chair, and lifted her shirt slowly. I saw her firm stomach, cute little belly-button with requisite gemmed piercing, and then a simple white bra, covering some very nice if not huge tits. I'd guess a solid C. Then again, I'm hardly an expert. 

 "Like what you see?" she asked, reaching up and shaking them. 

 "Very nice," I admitted. I hoped to God this wasn't the end of the show. 

 She laughed. "I can see you, you know. You're thinking I'm gonna stiff you, right? Bra isn't tits." 

 "The thought crossed my mind." 

 "I'm not. I wouldn't. I'm not like that. Karma and all that shit. Besides, I think you and I are going to be great friends in game, and I know who has the outrageous gear." 

 She leaned forward, showing me cleavage. "Close your eyes for me, OK?" 

 I really had my fingers crossed. On both hands. I closed my eyes. 

 "Open them." 

 The video window was full side to side, with the sweetest most perfect tits I could imagine. Ideal shape, pink areola the size of silver dollars, perfect hard little nipples a little bigger than a pencil eraser. I leaned forward, taking in every little bump, line and freckle. 

 "Don't disappoint me and start licking the monitor now," she giggled. "You've been holding up so well." 

 "I was wrong. I'll man up. Definitely not a neckbeard. You, young lady, are the real deal." 

 She backed away from the screen, her hands reaching up and covering her tits. "Fair trade? No scam right." 

 "Not fair at all," I said. 

 She looked mad. "How could you say that? I thought it was more than fair! I know you liked them." 

 "Unfair. In the game. Now." 

 I punched over. It wasn't fair. I'd underpaid. Let's face it, incredible gamer girl tits were a lot rarer than anything else in game. Possibly unique. We were still partied-up in her game. 

 

 

 

 

 I hit the /take emote key, for its pre-recorded message. 

 

 

 

 

 

 didn't pay enough. Now we're even 

 She picked up the Amulet, and dropped the previous one. She spent a few seconds examining it. I had her player up in the profile, and watched her swap out the jewelry. 

 

 like this 

 

 weeks from now, five times that. You still have a lot to learn. Amulets are attack gear. Max crit %, attack speed are more important than resist. Way more important than base stats. It is epic, but so are those tits 

 

 

 fair in your dealings? 

 

 

 

 me I'm not going to find pictures of my tits all over the place 

 

 

 

 expect such decent behavior. Skype? 

 I swapped out of game, and decided immediately I was going to upgrade my video card and run dual displays so I didn't have to switch out of the game. Maybe I'd replace the computer with something ridiculously overpowered, and play windowed. Fuck. Never mind. I'd run a second PC, second monitor. So much easier. 

 She was still topless, typing, her pretty tits jiggling. She turned to the camera. "I'm going to put them away now, Ok? Debt paid and all?" 

 "One more close-up?" I asked. 

 She grinned. "Hard to say no after that upgrade." She moved forward until those amazing breasts filled the window. "No screenshots, right?" 

 "I promise," I leaned forward, still finding it hard to believe these tits were on a fellow gamer. "Do you know how hard it is to believe that someone who plays as good as you, has tits like these?" 

 She backed away, giggling as she slipped her shirt back over her head. "Now that is the nicest thing you've said so far. You admit I play good?" 

 "You've got skills. Your movement in game is very good. You choose among your skills well. You still have a lot of holes in your game, and your strategy sucks ass, but you could be very, very good." 

 She leaned back crossing her arms. "So what am I doing wrong?" 

 I laughed "I don't have that kind of time. But you could start with worrying less about dexterity since you seem to have a ton, and work more on Attack Speed and Crit Hit Chance. I bet your Critical Hit chance is next to nothing." 

 "With my new Amulet, it's over 12%." 

 We spent about 20 minutes chatting about the best stats to chase, what equipment would have them, and why they were worth having. She was knowledgeable, knew the game pretty well, and was willing to learn. I was surprised to find I was enjoying the convo. 

 "I gotta run," I finally told her. "RL calls." 

 She grinned. "Don't you hate that? If only we didn't have to pay the bills, although I guess your Mom's paying yours." 

 "My bills are low." 

 "I'm sure. Pizza, Coke and Kleenex. Catch you in game?" 

 "Sure. I'll be around." 

 * * * 

 It was late the following afternoon. I was leveling my hardcore barbarian again, up to level 55. Things were starting to slow a little. I'd already finished Nightmare Act II. Champion Jailor Wasps damn near killed me, when I ran into a second boss crowd. 

 I saw the rose colored writing in the corner. 

 

 

 I was too busy to reply, barely keeping my ass alive in a whacked out rare timed dungeon. Run-run-run. I had a ton of interruptions, both in game and in RL. It was over an hour before I had time to respond to Cherry. 

 

 

 No reply. Maybe she was pissed at me for ignoring her for so long. I hit the auction house to see how my bank was doing. 

 

 there, could have helped a lot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 stupid expensive 

 

 $400K 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Cute girl. Total noob. Gold was too easy. How could she not be able to afford the basics? She did have decent gaming skills, just really short on game knowledge. I smiled to myself. Legendary tits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 and Kleenex 

 

 

 It was slow going. She'd never been there before, and these were some of the hardest fucker's in the game, in a cartoon setting. We wiped out the first Elite pack, and she went to click on the Happy Cloud. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 It took us another 40 minutes to clear the rest of the level. She died three times, and I died once. She did a good job of staying alive and rezzing me, I'll give her that. It normally takes me less than 1/2 hour to do the whole thing solo. We still needed work, but by the end we were getting the hang of each other.  

 

 

===

 

 

 

 

 way we farm places like this 

 Everything I'd picked up was pretty trashy, but I did get one decent rare. Probably 40K or so. Not worth the effort so far, but we weren't done. I had picked up maybe 25K in loose gold. I grabbed my MF gear, and portaled back. I had to wait about 5 minutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 We ran the level. I picked up 9 rares, including one good one, one very good one, and a remarkably useful legendary. The girl was good luck. 

 

 

 

 

 In town we spent another 15 minutes with me explaining what would sell and what wouldn't. She had a lot of stuff, but nothing as good as my best 3. Too bad. 

 

 

 I dropped the best of the loot at my feet. I didn't need it. Nothing would upgrade my personal gear, and I had plenty in my stash to auction for the next few days. 

 

 

 

 

 

 because you have better MF 

 

 luck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 We'll work on your DPS too 

 

 

 Damn. It was always like this. You help somebody out, and they keep beggin' for more. She should be happy I gave her the extra loot. The legendary boots would sell for a couple of million easy, maybe 3. Sigh. 

 

 in mind? 

 

 

 I didn't even have to log out. My old laptop was up, hooked up to my 24" display, Skype running. One button press, and it was on my main 32". I made the call. 

 The window popped up, bigger today. Her cute face filled the screen. "That was really nice of you to give me your drops." 

 "Not a problem. I would have sold them. You could use them. The boots are pretty sweet, I'll admit. You'll have a hard time ever replacing those." 

 She grinned. "Well I think you earned a reward. Close your eyes." 

 I closed them, smiling. Tits, Lord, let her show me her tits. 

 "You can open them." 

 I opened my eyes and almost fell off my seat. She was sitting back in her chair. A top of the line Aero, the girl had good taste. I'm almost ashamed to admit I even saw the chair. She had one foot up on the desk, the other extended to the side. She was wearing nothing but a pair of pretty striped panties. This babe had a body to die for. 

 She laughed. "Breathe, Ace. Don't go dying on me. I still need in game help." 

 "Nice. Are you sure you're a gamer girl?" 

 "You got lucky. I was playing in my underwear today. Figured you deserved to know after such a good deed. I appreciate it all. The info on what's good. The help with the game play. And of course, the awesome gear." 

 She leaned forward, putting on a little less of a show. It might have been even more exciting, seeing her moving around, her breasts in motion, looking so natural. "These boots are worth over a million, aren't they?" she asked. 

 "Three to five, depending on your luck." 

 She grinned at me. "Think this is a fair trade?" She asked, opening her arms and exposing her body to me. 

 "Please don't ask that. I can't afford a fair trade this time." 

 She laughed beautifully, her tits bouncing up and down. "No, I think you've given me plenty today, as long as you don't think I'm cheating you." 

 "Worth everything and more. Thanks." 

 "You're welcome." 

 I couldn't believe I was talking so casually to a nearly naked game girl. "You going to go back to farming?" I asked. 

 "I don't know. I was thinking of leveling my hardcore monk. You already passed me." She stuck her tongue out at me. It was so cute I wanted to die. Of course I couldn't let her know. 

 "Don't. Farm softcore. You need the gear. Write this down." 

 She leaned over the desk and started typing. "Act I Inferno. Start at The Cursed Hold. Go to the Festering woods and clear the two dungeons. Usually good for 2 to 3 stacks. Portal to town. Go to and clear Halls of Agony. Clear Cursed Hold. Make sure you have 5 valor stacks. If not, do Leoric's Manor backwards. Good for one sometimes two more stacks. Then kill the Warden, and Kill the Butcher. Go to town, and do Dank Cellar north of town, if it spawns. Got that?" 

 She was nodding. "5 Stacks?" 

 Noob. "Each rare Mob gives you a valor stack. The 5 stacks make your magic drops much better. Don't kill the Warden until 5 stacks. Once you have 5 stacks kill everything and open everything. Try it for an hour or two. One run should take less than 30 minutes." 

 "Good loot?" she asked. 

 "Some. Lots of loot. You can vendor, you can salvage. You can auction. Do it for a couple of hours and you should have some gold to buy things with." 

 She finished typing and sat back turning back to the camera. "You still here? Don't you have someplace to go?" 

 I grinned. "Yeah. But a few minutes won't kill me. I can't seem to tear myself away." 

 She laughed. "I'm sure. Perv. I'll let you know how the farming goes. I'm going to get dressed now. I'm not going to have you blaming me if you're late." 

 "Spoilsport. Leave the camera on. I've got Skype on my phone. Nice distraction from the meeting." 

 "Now you're being silly. Go on." She had her t-shirt in hand, and she turned it right side out before putting it back on. She looked at the camera. "Go. You're embarrassing me. I'm sure you've seen tits before." 

 "Once or twice. These are well above average. Like their owner." 

 She rolled her eyes, hit the keyboard, and the window went black. 

 * * * 

 When I logged in the next day, I saw the new friend request. I popped up the friend's box. Three new requests. One from CherryBomb. I thought about it. I really did. For several long seconds. 

 Deny. Deny... 

 Deny. 

 I was trying out some different skill combinations on my Barbarian, while farming Act III. It was good loot, and consistently difficult. Gave me a good feel for what was and wasn't working. 

 

 

 I quickly cleared the room and moved back to a safe distance before responding. She did deserve a response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 can barely survive Act I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 We made four runs in a row. She only died seven times. Three against one troublesome crowd that even killed me. Not bad, really. She was still woefully under-geared. During the final boss kill, at 10% life, I took a chance, doing a quick gear change. Wish I had a macro for that. He dropped four rares for me. 

 

 

 {CherryBomb] 3,4,5 blues and 3 yellow 

 

 

 She linked her gear to me. A backpack full of nothing but crap. Hardly worth the effort to try to auction any of it. 

 

 

 

 

 I was still scanning the gear. It was getting harder to find useful gear. People wanted max stats, good stats weren't good enough. 

 

 

 I had to switch characters, get one of my mules. Transfer half a dozen items back to my stash and switch back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 more careful. What's your Magic find now? 

 

 

 

 

 I scanned her gear. Got it. Less than a minute on the Auction house and about 4 million gold later, I was back. 

 

 

 

 

 The helm with the Perfect Star and the max Magic Find amulet would help a lot. The helm was a lucky find. Almost 2 Million, but way underpriced. It couldn't have been on the auction for long. Another couple of million for the treasure gem. The amulet was in my auction house stash, after not selling. I'd been asking a lot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Much easier than Act III. Even with the weaker gear she only died once. We stayed above ground until we had four stacks. Then into the vault. Typically 4- 5 packs, each one dropping multiple rares. And the jackpot. Legendary. Skorn. Best weapon in the game. Excellent rolls. Massive damage. Damn, this gamer babe was good luck! 

 

 

 

 

 She linked them to me, and she was right. They were valuable. Three to five million for the gloves. 

 

 my weapons? 

 

 

 To her, everything was epic. However in this case, she was right. At least for the main hand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 840 life on hit? And that DPS? Shit! 

 I equipped the best two-handed weapon in the game. 

 

 

 

 

 

 investment trivial 

 

 

 

 How much Gold did you get? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 We did two quick runs. She didn't die. The loot was good. We were mowing down the bad guys with the huge damage we were doing. Skorn kicked ass. 

 

 

 I laughed. She was stoked. 

 I brought up the camera. I was a little disappointed to see she was wearing an oversized t-shirt. Her hair was disheveled. She stood up, facing the camera. "That was incredible. We're playing easy-mode now." 

 I laughed. "DPS is the number one stat for everything. You like?" 

 She leaned over and a sexy pair of unpainted lips blowing up large on my monitor. She gave me a kiss. "I love it, Ace. You're too good to me." 

 I'm sure I blushed. "You bring me luck. You're great to play with. My lucky charm gamer Goddess." 

 She laughed, peeling off her shirt, wearing nothing but some simple light blue panties. She did an adorable pirouette. "Maybe someday you'll get to find out how right you are." She sat back, giving me a wink, playing with her tits for me. "Shit. I feel so inadequate teaming with you. I bring you down." 

 "Angel, you never bring me down. You're getting better. Lots better. Only one or two people I play with are as good. Don't put yourself down. Besides, you're more fun than any of them. We're a good team." 

 She grinned. Then pouted dramatically. "How can I ever pay you back for this? It really is too much." 

 "Another kiss?" I asked. 

 "You liked that? Better than these?" she laughed, wiggling her boobs. 

 "Not better. But yes. I liked that a lot." 

 She got closer to the camera, licking her lips. "You're not thinking naughty thoughts about my mouth, are you Ace? These lonely lips, and what they could do for you?" 

 "You have the sexiest mouth," I told her. 

 "A lot of people say I have a dirty mouth." 

 "A LOT of people?" 

 She grinned, blown up big on my screen. "Filthy. Language like a sailor. At least in game. If only they knew." 

 I giggled. She did curse in game all the time. "Knew what?" 

 "These lips. Barely been kissed." 

 "That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. A friggin' shame." 

 She leaned back, her face filling the frame. She looked a little sad. "Would you change that, Ace? If you could." 

 "In a heartbeat. I'd love to taste those lips." 

 "You'd be gentle with me, right? I know I come on strong in game, but real-life is different you know." 

 "Pamper you like a princess." 

 She pouted. "That's not what I need. I get plenty of pampering. I need a strong man. Like you. But gentle." 

 Was she still teasing? Like me? "I'd try. Gotta be honest, it would be awfully easy to lose control with someone like you." 

 "Tell me you'd be careful. Gentle. Breaking me in. Making a woman out of me." 

 "Whatever you need. I could be that for you. I'd be gentle. Gentle but firm." 

 "Kiss me, Ace." 

 I leaned in, close to the camera, I pursed my lips, but not for a quick blown kiss. I closed my eyes, parting my lips, licking my upper lip, teasing the tip of my tongue forward, imagining the feel and taste of her lip. 

 I heard a sexy moan. I opened my eyes and saw the fire in her eyes. 

 "I have to go Ace. I should have started getting ready 30 minutes ago. I wish I didn't have to." 

 "Wait. You ever play with voice chat, in game?" 

 "No." 

 "We should try it. Next time we get a chance, I'll call you, voice only, and we can talk in game. Makes things a lot easier." 

 "Voice only? You afraid I might distract you?" 

 I laughed. "I know you would. But that's not the reason. Much lower bandwidth, and the voice quality is excellent." 

 "Tomorrow. Morning. Teach me," she said. 

 "Everything I can," I promised. 

 * * * 

 I logged in and texted her by name. 

 

 

 I didn't wait 10 seconds. 

 

 use voicechat?

 We were playing at least a few hours together pretty much every day. She was getting better, and I'd have to admit I was as well. I was managing incrementally smaller upgrades on gear, but something improved every couple of days. Even better on our hardcore accounts. 

 As for Cherry, her gear was improving exponentially. We started playing our alts more to see how they stacked up. My Demon Hunter was doing massive damage, but still having problems with survivability. On the other hand, her hardcore wizard was kicking ass. We spent a whole day, nearly 11 straight hours farming hardcore gear for her, until it was almost up to her monk's level. 

 Our game play was becoming so smooth. With Skype on, one word was all it needed half the time to make sure we were in sync. I'd never played with anyone I meshed with so well. 

 Our softcore guys were making money, and learning the ropes, but hardcore was still the adrenaline pump. One misstep, and it was wipe and restart. 

 We were finishing up Inferno Act I hardcore, with only two levels of game play left to finish the whole damn thing. It was surprising how smooth the final kill went. 

 We were sitting back relaxing, talking about moving to the next step. 

 "What's New York weather like these days," I asked her. 

 "You stalking me, Ace?" 

 "Hardly. You give away too much when you're playing. Manhattan?" 

 I'd never asked anything that personal. We were all about the game and the occasional T&A show. 

 "Yeah. Only a block from the park. I should get out more. How about you? Or do you mind my asking?" 

 "We done here?" I asked. 

 "Video?" 

 "Would be nice." 

 "Switching over now." 

 I logged out of the voicechat, and called her on video chat. 5 seconds later I was looking at her. 

 "Disappointed?" she asked with her quirky smile. 

 "Never." 

 She was sitting in a pair of baggy pajama bottoms, and an oversized sweat- shirt. "Getting over some kind of bug. Trying to keep warm," she said. 

 "You should have told me. You could be resting." 

 "This is the best rest I can get. It makes my day." 

 "Me too. I'm outside DC by the way." 

 "So are we getting chummy now? Going to get all close and personal like?" she asked, grinning. 

 "Maybe, not too much. I'm sorry I'm such a weenie about this kind of stuff." 

 "Can I ask what you do for a living, that you have so much time for gaming?" 

 "Perhaps later. I don't have to work much; I have enough to get by. Twenty hours of work in a week would be a heavy load, lately." 

 She leaned back, stretching. "Ditto. It's been a dry spell here, but I can weather it. When work comes along, I may be away for a couple of days at worst. I usually can get some evening play in, but chances are the internet will be spotty. No hardcore on the road." 

 "You ever get down this way?" I asked. 

 "Not often. Why? Are you asking me out?" 

 "Sure. I thought we could hit Chez McDonald's if you've got a few hours to spare." 

 "Ohh, Mr. Generous. You buying?" 

 I laughed. "Haven't I bought you enough? How about that awesome ring I got you." 

 "I love it. The gem is particularly beautiful. I bet that set you back a pretty penny." 

 "It would be gauche to mention it cost over 6 million. My gamer Goddess is worth every penny of it." 

 "6 Million? Are you kidding me? You shouldn't do that, Ace." 

 "Steve." 

 "Steve?" 

 "My name. It's Steve. Not Ace." 

 "Well, Steve. Pleased to meet you. I'm Sheri." 

 We both started laughing. "We are kind of silly aren't we? Over two weeks, spending most of our waking hours together, and I didn't even know your name," she said. 

 "13 days since we first played together. 12 days since your first show." 

 "You counting?" she teased. 

 "Yes. I know the privacy is weird. Blame me. I've got hang-ups. Give me time." 

 She leaned closer to the camera. "Take all the time you need. I'm not going anywhere." She sat back. "Still, a ring like that, with a 6 million dollar stone? I feel like Elizabeth Taylor." 

 "I'm glad you like it. You're worth every bit and more."  

 

 

===

"You trying to embarrass me again? Looking for a show maybe?" 

 I chuckled. "You know me by now. I'll never turn down the show, but it's not required. No quid-pro-quo. I'm happy to gear you up. Playing with you is more than pay enough." 

 Her smile turned sultry, as she leaned closer to the camera. "You have no idea, Steve." 

 "In game, harlot! Playing with you in game!" 

 She laughed again. I liked that. "Tomorrow?" 

 "Do you even have to ask?" 

 * * * 

 It was getting ugly. It had started well. The Act III dungeon was good for a couple of chests. We were playing hardcore, my Barb and her Wizard. 

 We stepped in it. Deep. Two elite mobs, all the things you hate. Walls, magma, extra health, invulnerable minions, crap. We were barely holding our own when she took a massive hit. 

 "Out. Out," I told her covering her retreat. She went in the wrong room. Dead End. Fuck. We got walled in a doorway. Our own tactics turned against us by the AI. I pulled out the stops, using my last big damage skill. 

 "HEAL," I shouted to her. 

 "Cooldown," she whined. 

 I was down to about 10% life. Not good. I was walled in, standing in slow death, an invulnerable minion on each side of me. "Portal," I told her calmly. 

 "But..." 

 "PORTAL, DON'T DIE!" 

 I saw the animation start. I had to give her a few more seconds. Pot for health, and a push into the middle of the pack, pulling the mob with me. Block the door. Click, click, click. Dead. 

 "Fuck!" 

 It was enough. She had made it out. 

 A new tombstone, in my hero list. Not my first. Wouldn't be my last. 

 "You died?" she asked. 

 No shit. "Yeah, it happens." 

 "Not to you." 

 "Even to me. At least you made it out." 

 "What are you doing now?" 

 "Starting a new hardcore Barb." 

 "I'm sorry," she said plaintively. 

 "I'm not. It happens. Not your fault. Ugly mobs. The invulnerable minions ruined it. No healing, no way past them. I had the wrong skills for this group. I screwed it up." 

 "You sacrificed yourself so I could get away." 

 "No reason both of us should die." 

 "You could have made it, if not for me." 

 "Maybe. I'd rather see you stay alive." 

 "I...I've got to go," she said. It sounded like she was crying. 

 "Don't get upset. It doesn't bother me. I'm happy you made it. I'll catch up fast. Give me a day." 

 I was talking to dead air. 

 * * * 

 I slept two hours. I was level 41 when she showed up the next morning. 

 

 

 I was in a hairy spot. It took me a couple of minutes before I could answer. 

 

 

 

 

 I finished up the dungeon, and popped out. Quick portal to town. Safe, I brought up voicechat. 

 "I'm on," I said. 

 "Good. Level 41? Already?" she asked. 

 "I had my crew help a bit. I'll be back in the fifties by tonight." 

 "God, you're fast. About yesterday..." 

 "It's a game, Sheri. It happens. Please don't sweat it." 

 "But you died for me." 

 "And I'll do it again, if I need to." I chuckled, "I have to. I can't afford to equip you again." 

 "It's not funny," she said. 

 "Help me level, and we'll call it even." 

 "We won't be even." 

 "Stop it, Ok? I wanted to do it. I chose to do it. Accept it graciously, and let's play. I want my fun Sheri back." 

 "When you didn't respond to my message, I thought you were still mad at me." 

 "I was never mad at you. Now get your monk out, and help me. I hate being lower level than you," I teased. 

 We played until late at night. PerZeus offered to help, as did GnuMeat, but I stuck with Cherry. I was getting exhausted, sloppy, when she told me to call it quits. I was level 52. "A couple of more levels." 

 "No. Stop. We can do it tomorrow morning. You're taking too many risks." 

 She was trying to talk sense into me. Tired and sloppy was not the way to play hardcore. "You're right. Let's get to the next waypoint, and we'll call it a night." 

 We made it safely, cleaned out our bags, and logged out. 

 "Skype," she said. 

 I turned on the video chat, and was greeted by an exhausted looking girl. "Wow, you look like crap." I teased. 

 She smiled. "Nice. Exactly what I was hoping to hear from my game beau." 

 "Ok. You look like beautiful crap. We played too long?" 

 "I didn't get much sleep last night." 

 "I guess that explains the pajamas." 

 She laughed. "This is my new gaming attire. It's the hottest trend. You like?" 

 "Hell yeah. Then again, I'd like you in a burlap sack. Feel better now? We're almost the same level again. We lost a day and a half. No big deal." 

 "Your gear is shit." 

 "I'll get better. Most gear doesn't matter until level 60. Go through it in a few hours. Still an improvement over yours at this level." 

 "Rub it in. So you're really not mad?" 

 "Not at all. I'm happy to be able to play with my favorite gamer." 

 "Right. That would be GnuMeat or PerZeus." 

 "No it wouldn't. I turned them both down today." 

 "But PerZeus is level 60, hardcore Inferno Act III. He could have covered you easily." 

 "I'd much rather team with you. You know that, right? We click. I love Dan like a brother, but you and I are perfect together." 

 "Except last night." 

 "Even last night. PerZeus and I would have wiped. You survived. How cool is that?" 

 "I owe you big time." 

 "How about a kiss, and we'll call it even." 

 She smiled, leaning forward and kissing the camera. "Better?" 

 "Getting there," I teased. 

 She laughed, standing and walking around slowly disrobing. "When do you want to start tomorrow?" she asked, tossing her pajama top on the chair. She was going braless, and I was more than thankful. 

 "I'm going to have to take a pass, most of the day. I won't be online until after 9:00 pm, maybe later." 

 She was shimmying out of her pajama bottoms, and they slid to her feet. She stepped out and kicked them to the side. "Good. I'll get some sleep. Maybe actually eat something healthy. Work out. So many things I should be doing. You're corrupting me you know." 

 She turned away from me, wiggling her sweet little butt. She was wearing sexy boy shorts under those pajama bottoms. And she had her thumbs hooked in the sides, slowly working them down. "What's it worth, Steve? Panties on the ground?" 

 "Four hours of farming. First choice of all drops," I offered. 

 "Six hours, and a Topaz to match my Ruby," her hands had stopped, with her panties halfway down her cheeks. 

 "Eight hours, a Topaz and an Emerald," I countered. 

 "Hey! That's not the way it goes. You're not supposed to outbid me!" 

 "Please. 12 hours. All four gems, and 20 million in gold." 

 She was laughing so hard she had to sit down. 

 "Ok. Five hours and the Topaz it is. And no argument. After we get you to level 59 again." She brought her legs together bent at the knees, and raised them up. I watched those panties slide along her legs, then down her calves, ending up on one foot. She gave me a wink, and with a kick of her foot, the panties flew across the room. 

 And onto the camera, blocking my view. 

 "Nooooo!" I groaned. 

 The picture was back, her pretty face looking right at me. "Sorry. That was not intended at all." She walked slowly backward, exposing more and more of her body, until she was almost full frame. She did a slow spin. "What do you think? Too skinny for you?" 

 "I wish I could come up with the appropriate joke or even a nice suave comment. I can't. You are amazing. Simply amazing. A Goddess. You take my breath away." 

 She smiled shyly, turning and looking over her shoulder as she slowly bent over, her ass pointed my way. She gave a little wiggle and bounce, setting her full cheeks in motion. "You like?" 

 "I have goosebumps. God, I wish I had some way of conveying how much I like it." 

 "Show me." 

 "Show you?" 

 "I'm tired of being the only one half naked. Or fully naked, like now. Strip for me. Let me see if you really like the way I look." 

 I smiled. "What's it worth, Sheri?" 

 "Trust me?" 

 I nodded. 

 "I promise it will be worth it. Maybe not this minute, but I swear you won't regret it." 

 I moved back from the camera, pulling my shirt off. I wasn't as gorgeous as my Skypemate, but I did try to take care of myself. At the least, I ate pretty well. I could probably stand to lost 10 lbs, but I liked to think I wasn't hideous. 

 She gave me a wolf-whistle. "Take it off, baby." 

 I smiled at her. "This is a little hard for me. Not too much teasing, Ok?" 

 She nodded. "Just a little then. You have to allow me a little. You give me enough shit." 

 I took my shoes off, then opened my pants. I pulled the sides down, and my boxers were tenting badly. I stepped out of the pants, smiled for her, and gave her a raised arm hip roll and thrust." 

 "God. If I was there now, there would be singles sticking out of those boxers, all over," she said leaning closer to the camera. "Don't stop now." 

 "Close your eyes." 

 She did, and I dropped my boxers, taking my aching cock in hand and moving closer to the camera. "Open 'em." 

 Her eyes opened wide, and her hand flew to her mouth. "Oh my God. You're kidding, right?" 

 "This is what you do to me, Sheri. Every day, hours and hours each day." 

 Her face was pressed up almost against the monitor. "So I guess you did like what you saw," she said softly. 

 "Like I said. More than I could ever hope to express." 

 She looked nervous. Even a little uncomfortable. 

 "Should I stop?" I asked. 

 "Please don't. I need to do this." 

 "Let me know, if you change your mind." 

 "Give me a second? This is...difficult for me. But I want it. I need it. You have no idea how bad." 

 I stroked it once, up and down, turning slightly. "I think we should stop now," I said slowly. 

 "I think we shouldn't." 

 "No?" 

 "No. Stroke that thing. Let me see you finish for me." 

 "I...I've never done anything like that. To be honest, if I do, I won't last 10 seconds. Not in the state you have me now." 

 "Please, Steve. I don't ask for much, do I? Do this for me?" 

 I turned toward the camera, stroking my cock almost straight at it. She leaned forward, and I saw her hands moving down between her delicious legs. "You're beautiful," she said softly. "Not scary at all." 

 "I'm moving the camera," I told her, breathing heavily. 

 "Why?" 

 I lifted the camera and placed it directly under the monitor. I could now look directly at her stunning face, while stroking. It was like I was doing it with her right there, with her looking down at me. 

 "It's under the monitor isn't it? You're doing it right in front of my face." 

 "I told you. It's too much," I gasped, speeding up my stroking. 

 "Come for me, Steve." 

 I groaned and came hard. My cum hit the camera and all over the monitor. I watched her jerk backward in her chair, laughing self-consciously afterward. "God, that was so real. Right at me." 

 After the fact, I was dying of embarrassment. I opened the desk drawer, pulling out a roll of paper towels, wiping my cock clean, and starting on the monitor. "Jeez, I can't believe I did that." I muttered. 

 "Thank you. It's a hell of a compliment. I owe you one. I'm going to leave you to clean up. I gotta get dressed before I get sick again. This place has the AC up way too high." 

 "Goodnight, Sheri," I said. "Tomorrow evening?" 

 "Look me up when you log on." 

 * * * 

 I got my 7 levels, and we started doing some farming, careful stuff since we were still working our hardcore characters. PerZeus gave us a couple of hours, and GnuMeat pitched in for a while. I got a few texts from my buddies, and some improved level 63 gear started dribbling my way. 

 "You play the trades and auction house like it's more of the game than the leveling," Sheri observed. 

 "In some ways it is. Almost impossible to farm all your own gear, if you're going for the good stuff. I wish I had some decent auction bots. The Auction House here sucks. So hard to search for the good stuff." 

 "You seem to be doing alright." 

 "Ok. I don't like this part as much. Boring, and I don't get to play with you." 

 She laughed. "Is that what you want to do? Play with me?" 

 "In every way imaginable." 

 "When am I going to get my farming for dropping my panties?" 

 "We can start whenever you want. Hardcore or softcore?" 

 "If you're going to play with me, wouldn't you rather it be hardcore?" she teased. 

 "Hardcore it is." 

 We didn't get our full five hours in, but it was close to 2:00 am and we'd done more than four hours. We'd hadn't gotten much useful, until our last run. 

 "Bingo," I said, picking up the sweetest Mojo. 

 "What?" 

 "Jackpot. We've got a home-run here, babe. About friggin' time." 

 I linked it to her. "What is that? A snake? Any good?" she asked. 

 "I'll say. You could farm non-stop for two weeks and not find its match. I know someone who'll pay big for it." 

 "Really," Sheri sounded surprised. "What makes it good?" 

 I had to laugh at her. "You're kidding right? Silly noob. It's only 12 points from Max Damage, high min damage, huge int, decent vitality, 9% crit, mana regen and a socket. Friggin' epic. I've never seen a better one." 

 "Worth something?" 

 "Worth enough to upgrade half your gear. Let me put out feelers. Gimme a sec." 

 It only took 5 minutes to scan the auction house, and contact my buds. 

 "Alright. Not as much money here in hardcore, but I got an offer for 28 million." 

 "MILLION? 28 MILLION?" she shrieked. 

 "Yeah, probably double that on softcore, but that kind of gold buys so much more here. I'm gonna ask you a favor, though." 

 "Uh-oh, why do I feel like I'm about to be hoodwinked." 

 I chuckled. "ColMustard could really use it. He can only afford 21 million, but he'll owe you one, and he does a lot of farming. I'm sure he'll either have some sick gear for you, or he'll pay you later." 

 "You're serious. These guys are talking more money than I've ever seen. It's really worth that much?" 

 "More, but you can make a quick deal. Personally, having Jaime owe you one would be useful. Fucker will be wracked with guilt, and he'll be sending you everything but his first born, for that thing. Like I said, best I've ever seen. Poor guy's creaming his jeans as we speak." 

 "You don't talk about him much. He a friend?" 

 "One of the big three. He's just not much of a team player in game. Solo all the way." 

 "Big three. That would be PerZeus, GnuMeat and now ColMustard?" 

 "Yep. Dan, Mark and Jaime. I'd consider it a favor. I'll owe you one." 

 She laughed. "You found it, you're going to get me 21 MILLION gold, he's going to owe me one, and you're going to owe me one as well? Now I know I'm dreaming." 

 "Please? Seriously, every second you delay, he's out there going nuts. He just offered me his Helm as part of the deal. It's decent, but it's got a 6 Million Gem in it. Don't take the helm. He'll come up with something better." 

 "Alright. I just let him know he had a deal. He's so cute when he grovels." 

 I laughed. "First time I ever heard anyone call Jaime 'cute'. The guys will get a kick out of that. Go make the trade, and I'll meet you in town." 

 Five minutes later, she was beside me again. 

 "I've got a new 'friend'," she giggled. 

 "You're shitting me, right? Jaime friended you?" 

 "He asked. Should I have said no?" 

 It was a day for miracles. "That was nice. I think you're his fourth friend." 

 "Fourth? The gang and me?" 

 "You're in, babydoll. You got all three of us. Jesus, PerZeus is going to be lording this over us forever. I don't suppose you could de-friend him?" 

 "The man who dragged you into my web, kicking and screaming? Not a chance. Video-time, sweetie." 

 I punched out, and switched the monitor over. She was only a few seconds behind, smiling into the monitor. "You remember our first deal?" 

 "Like it was yesterday." 

 "Unfair. You way overpaid for those panties." 

 "Impossible." 

 "Seriously. 18 Million, and the last of the Big 3 as a new friend. How am I ever going to repay you?" She rolled her chair back away from the camera, and she was already peeling off her shirt, leaving her in cute polka dotted bikini panties. She chuckled. "Shit, Steve, I had no idea being rich would get me this worked up!" 

 I laughed. "You're getting me pretty worked up over here." 

 "Dick or GTFO," she said huskily, sliding her panties off her legs. 

 I stood, watching her, as I stripped naked, pausing for a moment to move the camera again, right under the monitor. Sheri opened her legs, her hand moving between them, rubbing herself. 

 "I...I'm wet," she said softly. 

 "I'm hard," I told her, centering myself in front of the monitor, and stroking my cock slowly. 

 "No, you don't understand. You're always hard. I, shit," she moaned, pulling her hand up and looking at her fingers, her beautiful pink slot on display. "I don't get wet, Steve. Not without a lot of solo work on my side." 

 "Show me," I asked her. 

 She scooted her chair forward, rubbed between her legs, and slid her fingers inside, moaning. She sat up, and brought her fingers close to the camera, separating them, a string of her sticky juices stretching between them. "You did this to me, Steve. This," she whispered, her eyes moving to the monitor, watching my hand moving up and down my shaft. 

 "I wish I was there," I told her. "I'd suck them clean." 

 She looked into the camera, and a sexy little smile stretched her lips. She reached down between her legs, rubbing in small circles, and sliding back inside again. She brought her messy fingers back up to the camera. "You'd suck this?" 

 "Jesus, Sheri. You're so fucking beautiful," I moaned. 

 She eased her fingers into her mouth, closing her eyes, drawing them back out slowly, clean. "Is that what you want to do, Steve? Taste my nasty juices, which only you can make me cream?" 

 "Right from the source. I'd park myself between your legs, and nothing short of Armageddon would pull me away." 

 "You...you want to lick me, there?" she asked hesitantly. 

 "More than I've ever wanted anything in my life. This is killing me. I want to smell you, feel you, taste you. I want to glue my mouth to that pretty little kitty, and make it purr." 

 She smiled, mischievously, "The boobies and booty might get jealous." She reached up and cupped her tits, giving her hard nipples a tweak. 

 "They wouldn't lack for attention, I promise." 

 She was watching my hand, slowly moving up and down. "Sit back, I want to see all of you, not just that huge dick." 

 I adjusted the camera, and sat back on the edge of the chair, opening my legs, still playing with myself. "Better?" 

 "Much. You're lasting longer this time." 

 I could feel myself blushing. "I cheated. At our last break, you were driving me so crazy I squeezed one off." 

 She sat up abruptly, closer to the camera. "You're shitting me! My voice got you that excited?" 

 I nodded. "I told you. I'm hard for you now half the time I play. The only time I'm not, is when I get myself off, and then it's only for a few minutes before I'm aching for you again." 

 "Do you do that often? Get off when we're playing?" 

 "At least a couple of times. Again, right after we're done. I'm sorry, I hope I'm not embarrassing you." 

 "I play with myself sometimes. That's why I'm only wearing my panties half the time. When you...the last time...you know, I went to my bed and had the hugest fucking orgasm thinking of you." She quieted down, her head bowed, and she looked up a few seconds later, her eyes glistening. "Thank you for that. I felt normal there for a while." 

 I grinned. "Sheri, you're anything but normal. You're exceptional. Amazing." 

 Her tears were running down her cheeks. "I'm not, but thanks for saying so." 

 "To me you are. The best girl I've ever known. I adore everything about you. I wish I could let you feel what I feel." 

 She had closed her legs, wiping her eyes with her arm. "I'm broken, Steve. I know it. Everyone knows it. I can't stand a man's touch, I'm frigid, sexless."  

 

 

===

"Bullshit. You are anything but frigid. You are so fucking hot and sexy, you're making my blood boil." 

 "I hate men," she sobbed. 

 "Do you hate me, Angel?" 

 She shook her head. "But you're not real. You're just a fantasy." 

 "I'm very real. Look at me." I moved my face closer to the camera. "Look, Sheri. I'm not a virtual person. I'm skin and bones, dreams and desires, and I'm falling in love with you. Tell me I'm not real." 

 "How can you say that? How can you say you love me? You don't even know me." 

 I smiled. "Do you think you know me? I think you do. You know what I'm going to do in game before I do half the time." 

 She grinned, sniffling. "Duh. You're pretty predictable you know." 

 "You're sweet boobies think they know me," I teased. 

 "Ignore them, they're just sluts." 

 "No, they're in love, just like me. Lots of my body parts want to get to know yours, very intimately." 

 Her grin got larger, "You think? The boobies have been wondering what those strong hands would be like." 

 "They'd have to share. These hands want to get to know all of you, especially the big three." 

 She giggled. "Big three? I hope you don't mean your clan." 

 "You know damn well what I mean." 

 "Tell me. Who do your hands want to get to know?" 

 "Your incredible tits, which I can see perfectly any time I close my eyes. That amazing ass, which I fantasize about every night. Your beautiful, wet pussy, which I'm going to meet someday, and change my mind about kitties once and for all." 

 The camera went haywire for a second, the picture wobbly, and then it settled down, showing her belly. She scooted back, opening her legs again, her inner thighs and pink cleft filling the screen. "You want to pet my kitty, Steve? Make it purr for you?" 

 "Pet it, kiss it, lick it, stroke it. I want to feed it, so much cream it would never go hungry." 

 Her fingers were moving, rubbing, slipping inside, driving me crazy. "How would you feed it, Steve?" 

 "I'd pet it with my cock, rubbing it until it was eager for me. I'd nudge its tight little mouth open, and push deep inside, slowly, savoring every moment of being there for the first time. So damn slowly, sliding deeper, every little motion in danger of making my head explode. I'd fill it, all the way, right to the end, and hold it there, the perfect fit, matching your tight clasp. Then I'd pet it on the inside, back and forth, learning everything about my new kitty, in and out endlessly, until the cream burst forth, feeding my beautiful pet." 

 "She's hungry. One feeding might not be enough," Sheri whispered, her hand working fast, rub, rub, slide inside. Rub, rub, slide. 

 "As much cream as she could ever want," I said. 

 Her weepy moments earlier had left my cock in a similarly depressed state, but now it was eager to deliver on my promise. 

 Sheri's feet were on the desk, her thighs trembling. Her hand was a blur. "Feed her now, Steve. Give me your cream," she begged. All I could see was the space between her legs, but I knew she was looking at the monitor. 

 I stood, bringing my cock to the camera, stroking it faster. "Open her mouth, beautiful. Open her mouth for me." 

 I heard her whimper, both hands between her legs, her finger parting her lips, exposing the bright pink interior. Her thumbs looked to be fighting over ownership of her clit, buried beneath a dense forest of dark curly hair. I cupped my hand over the head of my cock, letting the glans peak out from where my index finger and thumb formed a tight little circle. 

 I pushed forward, slowly. "He's sneaking his way in," I said softly. "First introduction." 

 I heard the trembling in her voice. "I wish it was true." 

 "See it. Feel it. Imagine it opening you, spreading you wide, sliding into your moistness," I whispered, poking my cock through the opening between my fingers, pushing downward, exposing more and more of my shaft. 

 She whimpered softly, her thumbs teasing her own clit, her fingers pushing into her pink opening, deeper, pulling wide, exposing a dark little opening. 

 "All the way, baby. All the way to the back. Filling you totally." 

 "Fuck," she groaned, her fingers sliding inward as far as she could. 

 "Quiet now, feel it." 

 I stroked my cock, slowly, ever so slowly, the full length of my shaft. I took my time picking up the pace, stroking faster, longer. Faster yet, until my hand was almost a blur. 

 She squealed softly, and I could see her legs trembling, her fingers darting into her fissure. "Coming," she moaned. 

 "Come for me," I groaned loudly. "Come on my cock." 

 Her voice moved up an octave, squealing. "F...F...Fuck!" she gasped. 

 I stroked steadily, taking care of the head at the end of each stroke, until I felt my own imminent release. "Spread it open," I demanded. 

 She had two fingers from each hand back inside of herself, opening up. 

 I put one hand down on the desk bracing myself, stroking my cock at her big- screen face, right in front of the camera. 

 "Come for me, Steve. Fill me," she pleaded. 

 I groaned, as I felt my release, spraying the monitor and camera again, as rope after rope burst forth. 

 A few seconds later her camera was back on top of her monitor, and she was acting shy. "I never expected to do that," she said softly. 

 "You have no idea how glad I am you did," I told her, cleaning up after myself. 

 She laughed. "No, I got a pretty good idea. Got you a little worked up, didn't I? Kitty loved the attention." 

 "I'm not the only one worked up," I reminded her. 

 She grinned back. "Guilty as charged." The smile slipped from her face, "I still don't understand how." 

 "Me either. I know you could do better, but I'm glad you chose me." 

 She looked surprised, then angry. "Don't say that. Don't you EVER say that!" 

 I was the one to look surprised. "Come on. Face it. You're one in a million, so beautiful you make my soul ache. The only girl on the internet. I'm just an out-of-shape, older guy, who's good at hitting a few keys. It's a nice fantasy." 

 I was more than a little shocked when she reached out and the screen went black. 

 * * * 

 It was late, and I should have been sleeping. Big business meeting the next day. Still, I was restless and disturbed. Worried. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 you to know you're special. To me 

 

 

 

 

 * * * 

 The meeting went well. The numbers guys had done their due diligence, and the price was right. I liked the product and their IP. Couple of nice patents. Dan, my best friend since childhood gave it his full approval. We closed the deal. My biggest yet. This would one would hurt if it didn't work out. 

 "You going to fly back tonight?" Dan asked afterward. "Want to grab a drink? Celebrate?" 

 "Maybe another time." 

 He gave me a knowing grin. "You're going to go play with CherryBomb, aren't you? You've forgotten all about your real friends." 

 "Hell. You know PerZeus is always welcome. It's your own fault. You introduced us." I gave him a friendly shove. "Besides, you know I'd never forget my few real friends." 

 "I know. Nice deal, huh? Thanks for bringing me in on it." 

 "You and your money. You're still on the hook for 20%." 

 He laughed. "You stupid fuck. You know I'd follow you in any deal, anywhere. The golden touch. You've already made me a wealthy man. All of us." 

 I didn't like to talk about money. "True friends. I'd give you all of it. Just ask." 

 "Ditto, buddy. You like her, don't you?" 

 "More than I should. More than I'm comfortable with." 

 "She's the real deal. Family has money. Her gigs take less than 20 hours a week. A bit of a shut-in. Shy and aloof. No debt. No crimes. No stalkers. No marriages. Great credit. Nice bank account." 

 I was not happy, to say the least. "You're checking up on her?" I snapped angrily. 

 "Of course. I'd rather have you hate me than get screwed over again." 

 "Damn it, Dan! You had no right!" 

 He didn't flinch. He stood up to me, like only he and a very select few ever did. "Fuck you, Steve. I have every right. I was there. Raked through the same damn coals. Don't tell me that I don't have a right." 

 "She's not like that," I told him. 

 "I had to make sure. I'm sorry if you think I overstepped my bounds. If I didn't do it, you know Mark or Jaime would have." 

 He was right. I had a history of bad decisions with women. And they'd suffered through the last one with me. It hurt all of us. "I like her Dan." 

 He smiled. Put his hand on my shoulder. "One drink in the bar. Then you can tell me." He chuckled, "She is different. Special. I like her too." 

 I'd been hoping to get online early, but one drink became two, then three. I told him about our escalation, and little webcam games. He was laughing, and jealous as hell. "Got any pics?" 

 "Nope. Sorry." 

 "You fucking liar. Mr. Security? Records every damn thing that goes across the internet? You're holding out." 

 He had me. I didn't consider it lying to her, I really didn't record anything other than what I always did, which was everything. I brought out my iPad. "One look, and not the good stuff." 

 I showed him a picture of her leaning back in her chair, laughing, dressed only in panties and bra. Another one of the close up of her lips, "kissing me". 

 "She's a honey. Who would ever guess?" he said, zooming in on the picture. 

 "You knew that already. I'm sure you have pictures." 

 He laughed. "Not like these." He passed me back the tablet. "She's got my Ok. Seems safe. She's not dating. You should pursue it." He looked at his watch. "Hell, it's not even 10:00 pm. You want to go over there? Surprise her?" 

 "Hell no. That's not going to happen. Not like this, by surprise, half-drunk." 

 He looked serious for a moment. "You're happier lately. Don't think we don't notice. She's good for you." 

 I nodded. "I am happier. She is good for me." 

 He took my drink. "I've got the bill. Go play with her." 

 I didn't argue. It's where my heart was. "Thanks for the talk. And the research. I understand why you thought you had to do it." 

 "We're friends. Fuck, who am I kidding, we're family." 

 "Yes we are. I couldn't ask for better." 

 "Ditto. Now go. I'm sure she's waiting." 

 The laptop was good, but it wasn't like playing at home. Different keyboard, smaller screen, slower connection. 

 I started up the game, logging in. She was playing. 

 

 

 I slipped on the head phones, connecting via Skype. 

 "Sorry I'm late." 

 She laughed. "Good start. I was going to chew you out. I've been farming." 

 "Good," I was feeling all sappy, after my conversation. "I missed you today." 

 "You too. Everything go well?" 

 "Great. Closed the deal. Hung out with PerZeus a bit. I'm on my laptop so nothing too difficult tonight. I'll be flying back tomorrow." 

 "Where are you?" she asked. 

 "Downtown." 

 "Here? Manhattan?" 

 "Yeah. The Carlyle. Gotta keep up the image." 

 "Did you...do you want to meet?" she sounded as nervous as me. 

 I took a deep breath. "I do. Not like this. It's late. I've been drinking. I'm in my damn monkey suit. Sometime. Soon. But not tonight Ok?" 

 She chuckled. "Thank God. I'm a horror right now. You'd run screaming. Soon?" 

 "Soon. And for the record? I'd never run." 

 "Next Friday? I have a thing I have to go to. I could use a handsome date." 

 A chill ran down my back. Meet her? Face-to-face? Friday? Could I? 

 She must have been concerned with my lack of response. "I understand if you're busy." 

 "No. I'd love to meet you. Pick you up at your place? Give me a time." 

 "7:00. I'll text you my address." 

 I didn't need it. I was embarrassed. "I have to tell you something." 

 "Let me guess. You're really 50 years old, 5'2 and 300 lbs. You have a stand-in for our chats." 

 "No, seriously. I know where you live. What you do. Everything." 

 I heard the catch in her voice. "You are stalking me!" 

 "No. One of my guys had you investigated. I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea." 

 "Damn it, Steve! That's not right," she sounded furious. 

 "I know. I'm sorry. That's why I wanted to tell you. I just found out." 

 "Your posse, wasn't it? Fuckers won't tell me dick about you. They all clam up like it's some kind of national secret. What do you have on them?" 

 "Friends. Good friends. I don't have many, but these are like brothers. They were worried for me. I've had some problems with relationships in the past. They were only trying to protect me." 

 "PerZeus? GnuMeat? Which one, damn it! I'm going to tear them a new one." 

 She would too. Vicious little thing. I chuckled. "Don't. For me. Please. Let this one go, and I'll owe you one." 

 She sighed loudly. "Steve, this isn't something some toy in game is going to fix. You betrayed me." 

 "I know. I was hoping you could understand, I didn't want this. I told you as soon as I found out. I love what we have, and it would kill me to ruin it. Let me make it up to you." 

 "Fine. One chance. No more holding back. You know all about me, I want to know about you." 

 It was difficult, but I did it. I told her. About my background. No family. Three childhood friends, and two more college friends starting a business. Failing, and doing it again. Got it right the third time. A bad relationship, with my first serious girl cheating on me with one of my partners, both no longer in the picture. Later a wife, cheating slut who screwed me over when we sold the business, transferring her stock ownership after we got bought out, working with my enemies to force me out. I'd been conned by her from the start. I had money, and friends, but the business I'd built from scratch and poured my soul into yanked out from under me. We got our payday, but I was betrayed, and lost. Nothing to dedicate my life too. Eighty hour work weeks became zero. Until Dan and Mark got me into the Venture Capital game. It gave me something to do. Not enough, but something. 

 My friends were all men. I had an issue trusting women. I'd been burned badly, twice. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 

 She was quiet on the other end. Not interrupting, letting me get it all out. 

 "That's me. I don't trust anyone I haven't known for 15 years. Especially not women. I'm a recluse, rarely leaving my house. I don't socialize anymore. I don't do much of anything except play these fucking games. A month from now, I'll be done with Diablo and I'll have to find a new outlet." 

 "I'm sorry," she said softly. "You must know, after digging up all my shit, that I would understand. I won't press it. We can skip next Friday." 

 "No, Sheri. Please. I do want to meet you. I have to. I can't live like this." 

 "Skype?" she asked softly. "Video." 

 "Alright." I brought up the video feed. She was sitting there, dressed to tease. Tight little shirt with 'Gamer Grrrl' emblazoned across the front. 

 She looked at me, and I could see her eyes were moist. "I want to hug you, now, Ok?" 

 I nodded, and she leaned forward and hugged the monitor. "That's the closest I've come to touching a man in two years," she said softly. "I'd like a real hug someday." 

 "Me too," I told her. "Thanks." 

 She smiled. "I'm still going to chew PerZeus out. He's supposed to be my friend. I know it was him. He's always too damned curious. Way fucking over- protective." 

 "He approves of you. That's a first. According to him you're special." 

 "Damn straight I am! He's not getting off that easy. I'm going to get those epic bracers out of him for this. He owes me." 

 I laughed. "His pride and joy? That should be interesting." 

 "We're on for Friday then? You'll need to wear a tux. It's formal." 

 "I think I can scrape one up." 

 She looked nervous. "It's just a date, Ok? Nothing afterward. I'm still not ready for that. I want to spend some time with you, see if I can, without freaking out. You promised to be gentle with me." 

 "A date. That's all." 

 She smiled sadly. "I'm tired, Steve. Mind if we don't play tonight? Tomorrow. Look me up tomorrow." 

 "Tomorrow. Looking forward to it. And thank you for listening." 

 "Thank you for sharing. Sleep tight. Sweet dreams," she said, grinning mischievously. 

 "Shit. I'm going to meet you for real in a week. That's a dream come true. Goodnight." 

 I called Dan. 

 "I thought you'd be online all night. She's not on?" he asked. 

 "You missed something. In her background. Problem with men. Find it out." 

 "Got it. Anything else?" 

 "No that's it. That and she figured out it was you who sold her out. You're in deep Kimchi." 

 "Shit, dude. You told her?" 

 "I told her she was investigated. She figured out who all on her own. You're not very subtle, are you? Never were." 

 He laughed. "Not my strong suit. Thanks for the heads up." 

 * * * 

 Things were awkward between us. We still played, and flirted in game, but there were no more late shows. We'd video chat some, and she'd still dress to tease, but nothing beyond that. We both recognized the issue, but we skirted around it. 

 I had my assistant make the arrangements. Hotel, flight, limo, tux. A few options for a late night bite afterward if we wanted. I was getting nervous. 

 Wednesday I got the call from Dan. 

 "You're right. I fucked up. She's damaged goods," he said anxiously. 

 "How damaged?" 

 "Kidnapping, assault and gang rape. Three days they had her. She managed to escape. The first person who found her walking down the street, naked and beaten, raped her again. Pretty ugly. She was hurt. The hospital pictures are bad." 

 "Two years ago?" I asked. 

 "Thirty months. She's messed up. Got her psychiatric records. That wasn't cheap. You don't want this one." 

 "I'll decide what I want or don't want." 

 "She can't stand men. Can't stand to be touched. I don't know how that idiot investigator missed it." 

 "Thanks for the info. I'm sorry I had to drag you into this." 

 "No sweat. You want I should send you the package?" 

 I knew he meant the pictures. "No. She's been raped enough." 

 * * * 

 On Thursday we played for a couple of hours until she abruptly cut me off. "Video. Now." 

 I switched over. She was as beautiful as always, still dressed teasingly. I don't know how she did it. 

 "What's wrong? You getting cold feet about tomorrow?" she asked nervously. 

 "Nothing's wrong. I'm still looking forward to our date." 

 "Bullshit. Something's wrong. You don't think I know you by now? Spill." 

 She deserved to know. "I was wrong. I didn't know all about you. I didn't know about your ordeal two years ago." 

 She sighed and put her head in her hands. "Jesus, Steve. So I'm not good enough now? Too dirty? Soiled goods?" 

 "Stop. That's not it. Not at all. But when we talked, you seemed to think I knew. I wanted you to know the truth. I'm sorry." 

 She leaned back, and I saw she was crying. "I understand if you don't want to go out. This probably won't work, you know. I'll probably run screaming. I can't stand to be touched. The thought of a man doing things to me makes me physically sick." 

 "What I don't understand is the way you can tease me and joke with me over the web. How could you even stand to see my...my penis, after what happened to you?" 

 "I don't know. In game it's easy enough, everyone's anonymous. Teasing you over Skype made it a fantasy. Like I was normal. Almost like a real relationship. I've never had a boyfriend. I liked pretending that you and me, we could be like regular people."  

 

 

===

"You wanted to see me. Down there. You even seemed to like it." 

 She blushed. "I did like it. Fuck if I know how. It wasn't real. My boyfriend getting excited over me, like a normal couple. I liked it. I'm scared to death it won't transfer to real life. I know it can't." 

 "But you're willing to try." 

 I saw the tears in her eyes. "Please. You'll have to take it slow. Try to understand if I freak out on you. The party alone is terrifying." 

 "Maybe we should start out on a normal date. No crowds." 

 She shook her head. "I have to go. It's family. I need to do something. I'll end up a crazy old woman in a house full of cats at this rate." 

 "Cats? Please tell me you're not a cat person." 

 She laughed. "That's the deal breaker? Not the rest of it? Cats?" 

 "Don't dodge the subject. Fess up. There's a line, you know. Some things a man can't accept." 

 Sheri shook her head and got up. She didn't say anything, she just walked out of the camera view. 

 God, had I fucked up? I was trying to lighten the mood. I waited patiently. I had nothing else to do anyway. 

 She was gone a while. At least a couple of minutes. She came back and settled into her chair, looking up at the camera. She tapped her hand on the desk, and a big beautiful chocolate lab hopped up, panting in front of the camera. 

 "Steve, meet Max." She put her arm around his neck, hugging him. "The only man in my life for the last couple of years. He's a deal breaker. No Max, no me." 

 I grinned. "He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Gamer, gorgeous and loves dogs. No wonder I adore you." 

 She peeled off her shirt, laughing. "He's the most beautiful thing? Mangy ol' cur. Have you forgotten about these already?" She was wearing a simple cream bra. I didn't know she had anything that plain. 

 "Like I could ever forget? They're pretty sweet. But have you seen that dog? Really seen him? He's the whole package." 

 She leaned forward, and Max licked her face. She pushed him away. "Bullshit. You know which you would choose." 

 "Really? You would make me choose? And I thought you were nice." 

 "No you didn't. I'm not nice, and you know it." She leaned closer. "I'd never make you choose. It's a package deal." 

 I laughed. "Smart girl. Sweeten the pot. How'd you know I had a weak spot for labs?" 

 "Did my research. Your first dog, Yogi? When I saw that, I knew it was destiny. Max's grandma was Boo-Boo." 

 "You're checking up on me?" 

 "Not me. Dad. He wanted to know who the man was I'd leave my room for. Sorry. At least you're honest." 

 "Scared off yet?" I asked. 

 "Hardly. If anything I want you more. Oh, and I want a limo and an orchid corsage. I think you can afford it. Be glad I don't ask for the whole florist shop." 

 "Pick one. It's yours. What color are you wearing?" 

 "A very light pink. A hint of lavender. I think you're going to like it." 

 "I don't doubt that. Cleavage?" 

 She blushed. "As much as I can dare. The boobies insisted. They think they have a very special relationship with you." 

 "I think they're smarter that both of us. Matchmaker boobs." 

 "I know, right? I would try to hide them. Let you and me get to know each other. As soon as they'd hear your voice, they'd perk up, make me miserable until I had to take my shirt off. You're not bribing them or anything, are you?" 

 "You caught me. I promised them a trip to Victoria's secret. They were complaining that the booty gets all the love. Fancy panties but nothing for the girls. Come on, look at that bra. I bet the booty is partying in lace." 

 "I've had the booty longer. The boobies have only been around a few years. The booty's been with me forever." 

 "Lucky booty. She deserves the lace. I'd be happy to invest in more." 

 "Oh no you don't! I see what you're up to. Butter up to the booty, bribe the boobies, next thing you'll be trying to get in good with the kitty." 

 "You wound me. You know my stance on cats." 

 "Why do I think you might make an exception for this little pussy...cat?" she grinned. 

 "I don't know. That's a lot to ask." I told her. 

 "I think I'll let her make her own case. She can be very convincing." 

 "I don't know. I'm a tough nut to crack." 

 She giggled. "She's cracked tougher nuts." 

 I leaned forward. "You are driving me crazy here, gorgeous." 

 She opened her bra, slipping it off, leaning forward. "Purely intentional. Trying to build up credit for tomorrow. Just in case." 

 "Sheri, relax. You've got a lifetime of credit already. You could stab me, shoot me and set me on fire, and I'd still come back for more. I'm not a quitter. I'm going to ride this out until you tell me to stop." 

 "Could be a bumpy ride." 

 "I'm thinking the ride of a lifetime." 

 She smiled. "That too. Ticket price is not too high?" 

 "Not for me. I'll buy a lifetime pass. Whatever the cost." 

 She leaned over and hugged Max. "What do you think, Max? Is he worth it?" 

 He licked her, and she laughed. "I agree. We'll give him a chance, Ok?" 

 She grinned, "Did you bribe him too?" 

 "Didn't have to. Us guys stick together. Bro-code." 

 "What time are you flying in?" she asked. 

 "I've got a meeting downtown at 3:00. I'll be at your door at 7:00. Wild horses couldn't keep me away." 

 "This is going to be great, isn't it?" she asked. 

 "Perfect."

 Thank you for reading. This is chapter 1 of a 3 chapter story. If you enjoyed it, you're invited to comment and vote!

============================== 

 Gamer Goddess vs the Real World 

 As mentioned in chapter 1, this story is very online-gaming-centric. It uses a lot of concepts, vocabulary and acronyms from games, especially Diablo 3, which this story revolves around. 

 Overall, I'd categorize this entire story as a Romance. I decided to submit Chapter 1 as exhibitionist/voyeur due to Sheri's emotional breakthrough via the online world, and video chat. I submitted this chapter as the same, because of the video elements, even though I believe relationships are the heart of this tale. And not just the one between Sheri and Steve. 

 ============================== 

 Date night. 

 I was nervous. No denying it. I had a few preparations to take care of, but I pulled up in the stretch limo by 6:30. Not by accident. By invitation. 

 Sheri's father came down the steps of their brownstone, stealthily peeking back at the house. The driver opened the door, and he climbed in quickly. 

 "Jon Elsworth," he said by way of introduction, extending his hand. 

 "Steve Jeffery, pleased to meet you." 

 He leaned back and looked me over. "So you're the magic man." 

 I grinned. "How am I supposed to respond to that?" 

 "Proudly? She's out of her room. Getting dressed up. Going out, with a man. I don't know how you did it, but I had to meet the miracle worker." 

 "I appreciate it. She's an amazing woman." 

 He smiled. "No argument from me. Her mother tells me you know her history." 

 "Only from reports. We haven't spoken about it. I didn't want to look too deep. It's her business, not mine." 

 "Once you walk up those steps, it becomes your business. It's shaped her life ever since. You're playing a dangerous game here," he said. 

 "Sir, no offense, but this is hardly a game." 

 "From what I hear, it's all about a game. It sounds like you're good. If you've mastered that one, maybe you can figure this one out. You'll never play a more complex or rewarding one." 

 "Anything I should know?" I asked. 

 "Wish I could help you. I do. She puts up with me, barely. I see her struggle, flinching if I even touch her. Do you know what that's like? Your baby can't stand your touch. Lying in that hospital bed, broken, and she screamed when I hugged her. Screamed. All I wanted to do was hold her and protect her. I couldn't even be in a room with her alone for weeks. My daughter. My only child. I failed her." 

 I didn't know what to say. It was difficult to hear. 

 "How did you do it? I have to know," he asked, practically begging. 

 "I'm not real to her. An avatar in game. A voice over a speaker. A fantasy boyfriend over a webcam. She's playful, joking, flirting, teasing, an absolute joy, but it's only possible in the abstract. I don't have high hopes for this working out, when I become flesh and blood to her. Still, I want to give it a try." 

 "Her mother and I will be praying for you. It's her cousin's engagement party. Her closest friend. She wouldn't chance this for anyone but her. She'll know almost everyone there. Still, you'll have to help her. Keep the men at bay. One hug, one grabbed arm, even brushing against her could ruin everything. Once she loses it, she's useless. For days. Do your best, please. Protect my girl." 

 "I'll do what I can. You can count on that." 

 "I have to go back. I'll see you in a few minutes." He shook my hand again, nervously. I couldn't say I blamed him. We had matching sweaty palms. 

 I spent a few minutes confirming everything was set. All my failsafes were in play, reservations ready. I had a few items ready for her within the Limo. I was almost certain we'd need them; I only hoped it was enough. 

 I felt like a teenager going on his first date. I was excited and nervous. I kept checking my tablet nervously, texting Dan and Jaime. They were great as always, trying to settle me down. 

 At five minutes 'til, I grabbed the orchid and got out of the Limo. I walked up the stairs to the brownstone and waited a bit, breathing deeply, thinking calming thoughts. We were friends, Sheri and I. Good friends. That should carry us through. I trusted her, and I believe she trusted me. 

 My knock on the door was answered almost immediately. Jon let me in, shaking my hand. "He's here!" he shouted toward the back of the house. 

 God, he looked more nervous than me. He was sweating bullets, rocking back and forth on his heels. I put my hand on his shoulder. "Relax, Jon. It happens or it doesn't. If this turns out to be a flop, we'll retreat, and try again later. I'm in it for the long-haul." 

 "I don't get it," he said. "We've tried everything, counselors, therapists, drugs, group, none of it has helped very much. Then out of the blue, you're here. I don't get it." 

 "I suspect everything else did work, at least some. It's been a journey, and I was the one lucky enough to be there when she was ready to take the next step." 

 An attractive, elegant woman, I'd guess in her early 40's, came tearing down the steps. "She's on her way, just a couple more minutes." She turned toward me, glancing at her husband. 

 "Carolyn, this is Steve Jeffery, our daughter's date for the evening. Steve, this vision of loveliness is my wife, Carolyn." 

 I took her hand, leaning over to kiss it, formally, when she pulled me into her arms, tears rolling down her lovely face. "I don't know how you did it, but I can never thank you enough." 

 I held her up and brushed her tears away, trying to stifle my own. "No tears now. Please. Thank you for trusting me with her." 

 She nodded, wiping her face. 

 I turned to Jon. "Is Max around?" 

 He nodded. "Kept him in back, didn't need you both covered with dog hair." 

 "Could you get him? I think it'll help. He's a bond, and I would like to meet him anyway." 

 Jon seemed a little confused, but he walked away, and couple of minutes later that gorgeous chocolate lab came bounding in and greeted me like a long lost friend. I knelt down and hugged him, rubbing behind the ears, playfully. He rolled over and I scratched his belly, aggressively, getting his leg kicking. 

 "Oh, that's great," I heard from the stairs. "Friggin' Max steals my big entrance scene." 

 I looked up, laughing, and stopped in shock. She was stunning. The pink dress, with hints of lavender, was form-fitting, full length, a slit up the left side to mid-thigh. Spaghetti straps, no sleeves, the front curving over the top of her breasts, diving down daringly between them, showing plenty of cleavage. Her hair was up, long wisps falling in front of her ears, drop earrings hanging from her lobes. No glasses tonight. Simple necklace, looked like platinum and diamonds, short, accentuating her slender neck more than her breasts. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think. 

 She paused in mid-step, looking around. "Is...is something wrong?" she asked nervously. 

 Her mother laughed, "No baby, that's a natural reaction. You're going to have to get used to it." 

 "You...you're so beautiful, baby," her father said softly. 

 She chuckled, walking carefully down the steps, her heels obviously something she wasn't too comfortable with. "Sure Dad. I bet you say that to all your girls." 

 He grinned. "I do. Doesn't make it any less true." 

 She looked at me. "Well?" 

 I had struggled to recover, and took the coward's way out. "What do you think, Max? She good enough to go out with us?" 

 She stood over me, glaring at her puppy. "Max, you fucking traitor. Rolling over for him the minute he walks in the door." 

 I stood, and Max rubbed up against me, while I opened the flower box. "Bro- code, Cherry. You know how it goes." I grinned. "You do look lovely. Not my favorite outfit of yours, but it'll do in public." 

 She grinned, blushing. "Don't start." She chuckled, "You know I got PerZeus's bracers today." 

 I laughed, casually reaching forward and pulling her dress away from chest, sliding my fingers inside and pinning the corsage on. "You're shitting me! I talked to him today, and he never mentioned a thing. How the hell did you manage that?" 

 I saw her tense up a bit, especially when my fingers brushed against her skin. I tried to keep her engaged in our virtual world conversation. She laughed, and it was a beautiful, easy going joyous sound. "I told him I was going to cancel our date, since I couldn't trust your friends. I had him shitting bricks. I could have stripped his character completely." 

 "That's mean," I teased her, adjusting the flower, and patting it in place. "You didn't mean it, I hope. You know you can trust him." 

 She kicked me teasingly. "Of course I didn't mean it. Doesn't mean I can trust him. I know you can, but that's not the same." 

 "Do you have a leash for Max?" I asked. 

 "Leash?" Jon looked surprised. 

 "Yeah. She promised me a package deal. No Max, no date, no way," I teased, winking. 

 Sheri started to say something, but thought better of it, turning to her mother. "Did he screw up the corsage?" she asked, with a sly glance toward me. "Barbarians have never been known for their sense of style." 

 Her mother played with it for a few seconds, leaving it exactly as it was. Jon showed up with the leash and attached it to Max. He stood looking at his girl, trembling. I knew he wanted to reach out to her, but couldn't. 

 I think Sheri surprised all of us, including herself, when she gave her father a brief hug. "Thanks Dad, for everything. I couldn't do this without you. I love you." 

 We left him with tears in his eyes, while Max tried to kill me, dragging me down the steps. 

 The driver opened the door for us. Although horribly uncouth, I got in second, following Max, and tied his leash down, tossing him a treat to get him to settle. I scooted in as far as I could, and she climbed in afterward, suddenly looking horribly nervous. The driver closed the door after her. 

 "I lied. I think that's my second favorite outfit of yours," I told her. 

 She smiled awkwardly. "Bunny PJs number one?" 

 "Right the first time. How'd you know?" 

 She reached out and smacked me. 

 "Nervous," I asked her. 

 She nodded. 

 "Want to talk about it?" 

 She shook her head. I could sense the anxiety building up, her breathing getting faster. Time for the first of my crutches, and by far the most important. I hoped to God I had guessed right. 

 "Turn to look out the window, Cherry, your back toward me. Trust me." 

 She turned, slowly, and I reached around her and place the 10" tablet in her hands. She looked down at it, into my smiling face. 

 I turned away from her, our backs maybe a foot apart. I looked into my matching tablet. "You're not going to wuss out on me. Don't make me get the boobies and booty involved. You know they'll side with me." 

 Her face on the screen grinned. "Not tonight. I made them promise. I gave them my own bribes. They're both very happy right now. And nothing as cheap and gauche as Victoria's Secret." 

 "Jesus, Sheri! Frederick's? You really think that's fair?" 

 She leaned over, and pulled her top out a little, showing me a lacy pink and red bra. "All's fair in love and war." 

 "I picked up some loot today," I told her. "Open the compartment on the door." 

 She reached off screen, and came back with a box. "Can I open it?" 

 "You know I need to gear you up. Someone gave you a hell of an amulet, but I think you need this. Go ahead." 

 She opened the box and gasped. "Stats?" 

 "Primary is +100 Courage and Beauty. I think the beauty's wasted, pretty sure you've already maxed out there. Also has some other crap, like 120 resist to fear." 

 She laughed, putting it on her finger. "Noob. Fear has a 70 max." 

 "70 Fear resist, plus vampiric resist from teammates. As long as I'm nearby, you have nothing to fear. Ever." 

 "What's the stone?" 

 "Perfect Star Ruby, sorry it doesn't match your outfit and other jewelry better." 

 She laughed, "God, who's the noob now, AceHole? Any pro knows you don't go for the matching sets unless there's an ungodly bonus. This is perfect. Do I want to know how much I'm going to owe you for this one?" 

 "Please don't ask. I can't give you a fair price for being with you tonight. No way I can afford that." 

 She giggled, and I felt her back touch mine softly. "According to Dad, you can afford a hell of a lot." 

 "Not you. Not this. Don't make me get all sappy, now, right before we have to hit the dungeon." 

 "I'll have you at my side, like always. Watching out for me." 

 "And vice versa. No Dead Ends this time Ok? We're playing hardcore." 

 I leaned back a little and felt more of her weight against my back. 

 "We can handle this, right?" she asked. 

 "Stupid question and you know it. Is there anything in game that you and I can't handle together?" 

 She shook her head. "No. You're right. We make a hell of a team. PerZeus is jealous you know." 

 "Of course. Who wouldn't be? Smart, sexy, gorgeous, and a kick-ass gamer. You got it all babe." 

 "No, silly. He's jealous of me. Taking all your time." 

 "Maybe a little. He's been #1 since 9th grade. Even most of the time during my marriages. That probably should have told me something. Guess I'm kind of ignorant in some areas." 

 "Sandy's my PerZeus. The one always there for me. I wouldn't do this for anybody else. Thank you for making this possible." 

 Her back was pressed firmly against mine, her voice louder in my ear, than from the tablet. I was barely looking at it, preferring to watch her reflection in the window. But the ruse worked. It took us just far enough from reality to let her open up. 

 The Limo pulled to a stop, and backed into the space across from her cousin's place. We'd been holding it all day. I felt her nervousness return. She closed the tablet and put it to the side. 

 "Take it. Take the tablet," I told her. 

 "I'll look like an idiot," she whispered, sorrowfully. 

 "No you won't. Your cousin loves you, she'll understand. Being here is the biggest gift you could ever give her and she knows it. If the tablet helps, that's all that matters. Anytime you get nervous, for any reason at all, turn away from the crowd, and look for me online. I'll be there." 

 The door was open for her to get out, and she wasn't moving. At least she had picked up the tablet again. 

 "See where the Limo is? It'll be here all night, and Max is here waiting for you. If it gets bad, come back to the Limo. Don't even worry about me. You got that?" 

 She nodded. 

 "Then get your cute butt out there. Time to farm. Loot and XP. Nobody's better than us." 

 She turned and smiled for me. "We're the best, aren't we?" 

 "No doubt. Hell, you're almost as good as me," I teased. 

 "Asshole," she giggled, climbing out of the vehicle. 

 "AceHole, short for Ace in the Hole. That's what I am for you. Your secret advantage." 

 She waited for me outside of the vehicle, and I reached for her gently, turning her toward the driver. "CherryBomb, meet GnuMeat. He'll be out here if you need him. You can trust him with your life. I do." 

 He smiled, but didn't stick out his hand. "300 lb. neckbeard, Steve? Think you missed it on this one." He wasn't a big guy, maybe 5'10" but he had that hard look that came from working for a living. His family were mechanics, and he'd worked in a garage as soon as he knew one tool from the other. His rough look hid his sharp brain. Master's degree in mechanical engineering from MIT. Lead Mech E in all of our fledgling companies. 

 He wasn't done with her. "I hate to say this, and he'll probably kick my ass for it, but I have to warn you. You fuck with him, you betray him, and heaven and earth won't save you." 

 I was in his face before he could finish. "YOU STUPID FUCK! How can she trust you now, after you threatened her? Get the fuck out of my face! Get lost. I'll find someone else who has my back." 

 He shrugged. He backed up, looking at Sheri. "What I said. Remember it." 

 I had my phone out, already dialing Dan. 

 "Stop," she told me, her hand on my arm. 

 "No. I need someone here. Someone I can trust." 

 "He's the one. I know it. He'd never let you down. I'll never betray you, so his words are just so much shit. I want him here. Please." Her hand squeezed my arm, and I looked up at her. She meant it. 

 "You sure? I can have someone here in 10 minutes." 

 "I'm sure." 

 I looked over at Mark, who was standing there, acting like he didn't have a care in the world. "Tonight, you're here for her, not me. You fuck this up, and you and I are going to have it out. You understand me?" 

 "Don't fucking talking to me like that. I'm not some hired punk. You forgotten everything? Who has your back? I'm here. I'll do whatever it takes. Always. Fuck you, if you think otherwise, asshole. Fuckin' skirt has your brain fucked up again." 

 Sheri stepped in front of me, glaring at him. "Fuck you, GnuMeat. I've got his back, in game and out. Not like some sissified glass-cannon, taking his shots from a distance and kiting his way through the elites while Ace and I do the heavy lifting. You sit back and take your shots, but I've got his back. And he has mine." 

 Mark smiled. "Good. You remember that. Don't forget who has the 120K DPS in the background, ready to do serious damage if needed." 

 She turned and grabbed my hand, stomping toward the entrance. I was surprised by her response. I think she was as well, and released me after half-a-dozen steps. "Sorry," she mumbled. 

 I took her hand in mine, and she didn't pull away. "My girlfriend can hold my hand anytime she wants. As long as she has my back." 

 She nudged me with her shoulder. "Don't tease me." 

 "Wouldn't dream of it. I liked the way you shot him down. Too cool." 

 She giggled. "Damn, he pissed me off! I'd neuter him in game." 

 I looked up at the three story edifice in front of us. We were on the avenue, and all the buildings facing the road were old and stately. It was a mixed neighborhood. One block over, off the main drag, many of the buildings which had once housed the well-to-do had been converted into apartments. Not low rent by any means, but nothing like the places around us. Someone had money, but I guess that shouldn't surprise me. 

 She stopped and gave my hand a squeeze, then dropped it. I watched her take a deep breath. 

 "You Ok?" I asked. 

 "I think so. I need a moment, that's all." 

 A figure standing in the dark by the entrance stepped toward us. "You lose those bracers, your scrawny ass is mine," he growled. 

 She grinned. "PerZeus?" 

 "Dan for tonight," he said, standing tall in his form fitting tux. At least as tall as he could. Not an especially imposing figure, at about 5'7" and maybe a buck fifty. 

 She laughed. "I expected someone a little...bigger." 

 "Laugh it up, sweet cheeks. I own your ass in game, and we both know it." 

 "For now. We'll see how I do with my amazing new epic bracers," she said, poking away at him. 

 "Jesus, lady. Even out of game, you're a piece of work." 

 She walked over and I was surprised once more when she put her hand on his arm. "Thank you for being here. You...I think I can..." 

 He grinned. "I know, irresistible. It's a curse. I can't help it." 

 She smacked him playfully. "Way to ruin a moment, jackass." 

 His big smile disappeared for a moment. "Hey, just so you know, you're worth all of it. I appreciate that you can stand here with me. It means a lot. Big props, half-pint." 

 She smiled. "Ditto." She walked back to me, "What's his role?" 

 "Joining us inside. You get nervous or upset, and I'm not around, he's there for you. My brother by another mother, he won't let you down." 

 He nodded. "Whatever you need, sugar britches. I got your back." He grinned. "Awfully nice backside, I might add. Definitely worth watching." 

 I saw her fiddling with her iPad for a second, adjusting her grip, as if to verify it was still there. "I guess we can't stand out here forever." 

 I put my elbow out to escort her, and a few seconds later I felt her hand slip in and grab my bicep. I kind of wished it was bigger. She gave me a squeeze. "Take lead."  

 

 

===

We walked up and through the outside door. In the vestibule a man opened the door for us, letting us in, and the noise of the festivities out. 

 There must have been close to 100 people in there, and it was pretty crowded near the door. I felt Sheri's hand grip my arm tightly. "Dan," I said. 

 He stepped around us, and started walking through the crowd. I followed, with Sheri in his shadow. People were looking at us as we passed, and I heard the whispering, and a hush in our wake. 

 Mostly, I was looking for a break in the crowd, some space to get settled in. Someone had other plans. 

 I heard the squeal before I saw her. A tall leggy brunette, skinny but damned pretty, came barreling up to us. "Sheri!" she cried out, and a moment later my date was engulfed in her arms. 

 "God, I'm so glad you're here! You have to meet Robert. You going to be Ok with that? He's been dying to meet you. He knows..." she said. 

 Sheri was grinning. "I wouldn't miss your engagement party for anything. I'd love to meet him." She looked over at me. "Sandy, this is Steve." 

 I started to present myself, then I was fighting to keep my balance as our hostess leaped up and threw her arms around my neck, kissing me on the lips. Hard. I don't think I could have been more stunned. 

 "The infamous AceHole! Steve, you're my hero. Thank you so much," she gushed. "Anything you need, anything I can do for you that my fiancée would approve of, is yours for the asking." She grinned teasingly. "Maybe a little more if you can keep a secret. Hell, maybe a lot more." 

 Sheri was pulling her cousin's arm off me. "Harlot! He's mine! Damn it, you've got your own." 

 Sandy had an infectious laugh. "No shit. Anyone seeing him hover over you would know you're his. Shit girl, hit the jackpot much?" 

 I felt myself blushing. Dan came to the rescue. "Hey Cherry, what am I, chopped meat?" 

 She laughed. "Mr. Manners here is with us, if you don't mind. Dan's responsible for bringing hot-stuff and I together. Please forgive him if he drools or wets himself. He's not quite house-trained yet." 

 Sandy turned and gave him a big hug as well. "PerZeus is more than welcome. If he did nothing else ever, bringing you guys together would put me in his debt. I'll task one of the help with cleaning up after him." 

 He grinned. "I can keep secrets, if the same deal is on." 

 She laughed. "No way, Jose. I know Steve is too much of a gentleman to take me up on it. Just like I know that you're not." 

 "Hey!" I interjected. "Who says I'm a gentleman?" 

 She looked at me smirking. "Really? White Knight and all, you think it doesn't show? Face it, bub, you're toast already." She turned back to Sheri, grabbing her hand. "Come on, I've got a nice little spot staked out for you, and Robert really is dying to meet you." 

 Sheri reached back and grabbed my arm, squeezing my wrist painfully tight, as she was dragged into the depths of the house. A quick turn to the side, and we were suddenly standing in an oasis of peace, beside a column and behind a couch. Sandy turned and took Sheri by the shoulder, guiding her to the wall. She took me by the arm. "You, here," she said, establishing my post at Sheri's side, basically blocking access to anyone from behind the couch. 

 She walked over and took Dan by the elbow. "You're a hell of a friend, aren't you?" 

 "What are friends for?" he asked. 

 She leaned up and gave him a peck on the cheek. "This is your spot. Don't worry, I'll send a few single lovelies by to keep you entertained. You know your role, right? No more than one guy at a time gets back there." 

 He nodded. "Got it. I gotta meet this Robert guy. Seems like a lucky dude." 

 She laughed, giving him a squeeze. "You have no idea, sugar." 

 Sheri had seemed Ok, but I could tell she was getting a little flustered. She was shifting her weight, her eyes scanning the crowd. 

 "No worse than crossing that damned bridge in Act III," I said. 

 She looked up at me, and I saw a hint of a smile. "I was thinking the castle rampart catapults, and your job is to protect me, while those hordes of nasties keep coming." 

 "Shit, that's too easy. I'm used to protecting three of 'em. One little girl shouldn't be too hard." 

 She kicked out at me, connecting with my shin. "Watch who you're calling little girl." 

 "Ok, one gorgeous, stacked girl, with a hellacious ass shouldn't be too hard to protect." 

 She smiled, "The girl, the boobies and the booty all thank you, kind sir." She looked up, "...and it starts." 

 Sandy and, I assumed, her beau, walked past Dan single file. Not much choice, the way he had the opening blocked off. "Here she is Rob, my favorite person in the whole wide world." 

 He smiled, not offering his hand. "Thank you so much. You know you made her night." He turned back to Sandy. "Hey! Wait a second. I thought I was your favorite person!" 

 "No way. Favorite male person, and at the moment, that's just by a hair, considering Steve here got her out of the house, and the way you've been flirting with the Bobbsey twins." 

 He blushed. "You shouldn't leave me alone with those girls. They could eat a man alive." 

 I stuck out my hand. "Steve, second favorite male person. Behave yourself. I doubt I could survive being first." 

 He laughed, giving me a firm shake. "No shit. Tough job, but somebody's got to do it." 

 Sandy smacked him playfully. She seemed like an awfully physical girl. Not that I thought there was anything wrong with that. "Tough job, is it? Maybe I should see if there's anybody else that would like the position." She turned and looked over her shoulder. "I bet Dan would be up to it." 

 Robert pulled his fiancée close, and smacked her bottom playfully. "You don't really want bloodshed at our party, do you, love?" 

 "I see one of those girl's hands on your ass again, and we'll be knee deep in it," she answered, giving him a hard look. 

 Sheri seemed to be enjoying the little tête-à-tête. "Maybe I should check out that irresistible butt," she said. 

 Sandy's draw dropped. "Et tu, Sheri!" 

 My girl giggled. "You were manhandling my date earlier, dear cousin." 

 Robert gave her a look, and she blushed. "Jesus, you always were a tattle-tale. It was just a hug." 

 "And a kiss," Sheri teased. 

 "A small kiss," Sandy argued. 

 "On the lips." Sheri seemed to be getting a kick out of this. 

 "Closed mouth," Sandy whined. 

 "Mostly," I teased. 

 She gasped at me. "Keep it up, and you won't be number two much longer." 

 I laughed. "I'm not saying your mouth wasn't closed, beautiful." I gave Robert a wink. 

 His laughter was loud and strong. "Damn. I think we're going to get on just fine. I think a kiss for number two is definitely in line. That's all though. I wouldn't want you to have to kick my ass." 

 Robert was a big guy, a good 6'2" and obviously in great shape. I doubt if I could take him. No way I'd even want to try, he did seem like a good guy. 

 "That's all. I'd hate to bleed all over your nice new outfit. Besides, look who I'm here with. She'd skin me alive first." 

 "And salt you down, after," Sheri said. 

 Sandy took her man in hand. "The four of us. Soon, Ok?" 

 Sheri nodded. "I'd like that." 

 "You're sure?" her cousin asked, a little nervously, glancing at her man. 

 "Definitely. I can't stay cooped up forever, and if I can pry my man away from his myriad responsibilities for a bit, there's nobody I'd rather spend time with." 

 I saw Sandy's eyes mist up, then she leaned in and hugged her cousin. "I love you," she said softly. 

 "Me too," Sheri whispered. 

 I almost lost it when Sandy moved her lips to Sheri's in a kiss better than the one I'd received. "I can't thank you enough," Sandy murmured. 

 "Shh. It's cool. Everything. Go to your man." 

 Sandy pulled away, wiped her eyes, then reached up and pulled my head down, kissing me on the lips, her mouth a little less closed this time, her tongue caressing my lip briefly. "You," she said huskily. "I...shit, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you." 

 Damn if I didn't feel a moistness in the corner of my own eye. Just the left one you understand. Only one drop. I'm no friggin' wuss. 

 "I'm the lucky one," I told her. 

 Her lips turned back up, and Sandy wiped her eyes again. "I hope you know just how lucky you are." 

 "Luckiest man in the world," I told her, "with perhaps present company excluded." 

 She grabbed her husband-to-be and started to walk away. "Gotta mingle, and there are a lot of old friends dying to stop by. Let me know if it gets to be too much." She stopped and turned back. "You let this one go, I'm locking him in my basement. He's too good to let get away." 

 "Hey!" Robert said. 

 "Oh, don't worry dear. It would only be for when you're on travel. That's, what, about 50% of the time? I promise, the babies will all be yours." She laughed, dragging him off. He looked back at us, and rolled his eyes. 

 "She always like that?" I had to ask. 

 "This is one of her tame nights. He's good for her," Sheri said. 

 With the ice broken, a steady stream of old girlfriends stopped by, some chatting briefly, while others seemed reluctant to go. Several asked if she'd be around and if they could get together some time. Sheri didn't commit to any of them, but promised she'd be in contact. 

 I seemed to be getting a lot of attention. More than I was comfortable with. When the women showed up in twos or threes, too many of them found it necessary to stand very close. A few wandering hands found my waist, and one even crept a little lower. 

 Sheri noticed that. As soon as the offender was away she glared at me. "Public toilet would be cleaner. Tramp." 

 "I feel so dirty," I told her. "Used. How do you girls stand it?" 

 She tried to keep a straight face, then poked me. "Don't even think about it, bucko. You're all mine." 

 I leaned down and gave her a quick peck on the cheek. "And you're mine, gamer girl." 

 "Her tits are fake, too," she said. 

 "I know. The boobies already warned me." 

 Her grin was gorgeous. "Don't you forget it. They're very jealous." 

 "No worries. I prefer real and perfect every day of the week. Twice on Sundays." 

 A few guys stopped by, apparently most of them were old acquaintances, and she seemed to deal with it well. Mostly. After the fourth or fifth, I saw her getting antsy. "You alright?" I asked softly. 

 "I...I need a minute, Ok?" 

 I looked over at Dan, who managed to glance away from his ever-present new female friends every few seconds. I caught his eye, and ran my finger across my throat. He nodded, and stepped beside his latest charmer, blocking all access. 

 Sheri didn't look good. She seemed to be shaking. I turned her toward the corner carefully, and lifted her hand with the tablet in it. She opened the cover, and I stood with my back to hers, looking into mine. 

 "Want to blow this stand, and go kill something?" I asked. 

 Her face and chest filled my screen. "Too early, but it's tempting," she said. 

 "I don't suppose you could tilt the monitor down a bit. I think the boobies are trying to get my attention." 

 She smiled, and I got a view of her cleavage. "Like what you see?" 

 "Do you even need an answer? You know me and the girls have a special relationship." 

 I felt her butt rub up against mine. "Someone's getting jealous." 

 "No need. The booty should know by now it's a package deal. Especially in that dress, booty's getting a lot of attention." 

 "If you're good, maybe when we get to the limo, I'll let the girls have their way with you." 

 "Tease." 

 "Maybe. I guess you'll have to be patient and find out." She brought her lips up to the camera, giving me a pucker. "Thank you." 

 I did the same. "No thanks necessary. The least I could do for the woman I love." 

 She smiled. "Say it again." 

 "No thanks..." 

 "Asshole. Say it." 

 "I love you, Sheri." 

 The screen went dark, and she grabbed my arm, turning me. She was in my arms, hugging me hard. "Me too." 

 I stroked her hair softly. "Ready for the next wave?" 

 She sighed, releasing me. "Did you learn that from Dan?" 

 "What?" 

 "How to ruin a moment." 

 I pulled her in for a hug. "I would love to hold you all night, but the queue is backing up." 

 She looked over and saw more than a few curious eyes standing just beyond Dan, studying us. 

 She was better after that, and Sandy stopped by again for a quick visit. Somehow, she convinced Sheri to take the show on the road, and once again I was escorting her through the crowd, stopping for a drink for all of us at one of the bars, and making small talk to a few of the groups standing around. 

 So much better than I thought she'd be handling it. One guy brushed against her, and she turned away quickly, but managed to continue her conversation. I was afraid she'd panic, but she seemed to take it in stride. Damn, I was proud of her. 

 It was going too good. I let my guard down. After the second drink, I leaned over and whispered, "I have to hit the head. Be back in a second. Is that Ok?" 

 She was talking to two girls she seemed to know very well, and she nodded, waving her tablet. Dan was still standing only a couple of steps away. She was covered. 

 I made my way to one of the bathrooms, and waited in line for a bit. On the way out I met Robert, and he introduced me to a few friends before I could make my escape. 

 We'd been standing just outside the kitchen earlier, but when I got there, it looked like she'd moved on. I looked around, and saw Dan in the kitchen, obviously doing the same. 

 I pushed my way through the crowd. "Where?" 

 "She was just here. Not 30 seconds ago," he said. 

 One of the girls from earlier was standing nearby, and must have noticed our concern. "If you're looking for your girl, she took off like a cat with its tail on fire out the back door." 

 "What? Where?" I asked, looking for the door. 

 "She was talking to Dale, and then she took off that way," she said pointing to an opening at the side of the room, near the back wall. 

 "Call 'em!" I yelled at Dan, then took off after her. 

 The hall led to a utility area with a door to the outside. I was through it in a second, calling out for her. It was an alley that ran the length of the block in both directions. Stoops, garbage cans, utility boxes, and dark recesses were all I saw. 

 I was scanning the ground for some clue as to which direction she took when Dan came barreling out the door. I wanted to lambaste him for losing sight of her, but it wasn't the time. "You go that way," I said, and took off running in the opposite. 

 Like most of the New York blocks, this one was long and narrow, and seemed to go on forever. After a hundred feet or so I saw her tablet lying on the ground. I reached in my pocket and grabbed my phone. I pressed the push to talk. "She's this way," I said. "Tell the guys." 

 I was running now, and saw a crowd on a back stoop ahead. I was going to ask if they'd spotted her, when I saw her huddled in a ball, some guy's arm around her, trying to get her to drink. 

 There were three of them sitting there, one on the bottom step, touching her leg, the other two bracketing her, their bodies pressed against hers. She never even looked up at me, just sat, hugging her legs, rocking. It was a bad position, showing her panties to the guy on the bottom stoop. 

 I came to a stop. "Leave her alone, she's with me," I said angrily. Fuck. This wasn't good. She still didn't look up. She seemed almost catatonic. 

 The guy on the bottom step stood, placing himself between me and the others. "I don't think so. Looks like she prefers our company," he smirked. 

 I tried to stay calm. "Listen. She's my date. She's going with me. Just leave her alone. Can't you see she's not well?" 

 The bozo stepped toward me, "Get lost, asshole. She's fine here. You can't take care of her, we will. Go away and nobody has to get hurt." 

 The jerk trying to give her a drink reached over and thrust his hand in her top, smirking at me. "Private party, dickwad," he said. 

 I lost it. I should have waited; the others would have been there soon. Dan couldn't have been too far behind. But I couldn't. I'm not much of a fighter, outside of the game, but I rushed the guy in front of me, pushing him to the side, and grabbed for Sheri. I had her for just a second, before the guy with his hand on her was pulling her up the stairs, while the other two started on me. 

 I blocked a couple of their fists with my head and body, swinging wildly. I should have been paying attention to them, but all I could see was Sheri being dragged away from me. I launched myself at the guys with his hands on her, and drove him into the wall, hard. 

 I heard Dan yelling behind me, and I slammed the guy I had my hands on's head into the wall, and he dropped, letting go of Sheri. I turned and caught a foot in the side as I tried to get up, moving between her and the other two. I saw Dan was rolling on the ground with one of the guys, and I grabbed the leg of the kicker, dragging him down. 

 "Run, Sheri!" I yelled, trading blows with the guy between her and freedom. 

 She didn't move and I tried to push her. "Go!" 

 I caught a knee in the ribs, but managed to turn the guy and started whaling on his head. For a second I thought we were going to be Ok, when the door Sheri was leaning against started to open. 

 "What the fuck!" I heard, then saw the door push wider. I could only hope that Dan was doing better than me. I pushed the guy I was on against the door, wedging a foot against the rail, and gave Sheri a push. "RUN!" I screamed at her. 

 I wasn't fighting anymore, just pushing the guy, head tucked down, while he swung at me. I had to keep that door closed. Suddenly someone was on my back, beating down on my head, and the door was slowly opening despite my best efforts. A burning agony started in my back, sapping my strength. I couldn't see, and I knew I was in serious trouble. 

 I turned my head, and Sheri was huddled, shaking. "PORTAL, CHERRYBOMB," I yelled. "DON'T WIPE! PORTAL!" 

 I saw an arm and a leg snaking out the door opening with some kind of stick in its hand. The pain in my back took on a whole new meaning, and I could feel myself blacking out. 

 "Portal," I groaned. "Portal." 

 * * * 

 I shifted and bolts of pain shot through my back. I tried to move my arm and the pain moved to my ribs and forearm. Son-of-a-bitch, it hurt. I opened my eyes, and saw nothing but grey and white. 

 I heard footsteps, and a hand was on my shoulder. I tried to push it away and had to stifle a scream. 

 "Relax, Mr. Jeffery, don't try to move," I heard a strange voice intone. 

 I looked over and saw a figure in white standing over me. 

 "You've been injured," she said calmly. "Don't move." 

 I was lying on my side, and after trying to shift again, I knew she was right. I shouldn't move. 

 "Where..." 

 "Mount Sinai," she said. "You had us scared there for a while. You've got a lot of worried friends driving us crazy. If you'd settle down, I could check on you, give you something for the pain, and maybe we'll let you see a few of your buddies." 

 "Sheri." 

 "Shh. Be still. This will only take a minute." 

 It took a lot longer than a minute, but by the time she was done, my mind was clearing up and the pain was down to a dull roar. 

 The door opened, and in moments I was surrounded. "Stupid fuck," Dan said, standing at the head of the bed, looking down at me, anxiously. 

 "You...look like...shit," I said. It was hard to get the words out. My head felt like it was full of cotton, and my tongue was too big for my mouth. 

 I was right though. He did. He had his arm in a sling, and his face was swollen. Bandage on the side of his face, and a black eye tinged with reds and oranges. The split lip was an improvement. 

 "Look who's talking, dipshit. Couldn't wait for the cavalry could you?" 

 "Your face...looks better," I told him, trying to look around. Mark was there, looking fresh as a daisy, and behind him were Robert and Sandy. She looked like she'd been crying. I noticed that most were out of their party clothes, except Dan and Sandy.  

 

 

===

"Sheri?" I asked. 

 "She'll be alright," Dan said softly. I could see he was hurting, and I don't mean physically. 

 "Not your...fault," I told him. I knew the guilt would be killing him. 

 "I fucked up, Steve. God, I'm so sorry. I was watching her, I swear I was. I don't know how she got away. I know you must hate me. I'll leave if you want." The poor fucker was practically in tears. 

 "No. I...love you man," I said, doing my best to grin. 

 He chuckled, wiping his eyes. "You're not getting my Bud Light." Old inside joke. 

 "Where?" 

 "Jaime went for her. Relax. You did good, jerkoff." 

 I learned a little of what happened, in bits and pieces. Mark couldn't get the limo down the alley, and had to park it. He started at the wrong end, and was late getting to the scene. Dan never got past the first guy, and though I managed to delay anyone else joining our little get-together, when the asshole I'd knocked into the wall climbed on my back and started to make a pincushion out of me with a knife, things were looking bleak. 

 We thought we'd taken good precautions, but we hadn't planned on the back door. I always knew there was a chance she'd freak out. Mark had been by the car a few door down from the entrance, and Jaime had been stationed a short ways down on the opposite side, in case she made a run for it in the wrong direction. 

 When they got the call, Jaime had to crash his way into the party, across the entire house, then guess which way we'd gone. He'd heard the ruckus and got there in the nick of time, although a minute or two earlier would have been nice. 

 I looked up during a pause in the story-telling, and Man-mountain was stepping through the doorway. The crowd parted and I saw he was carrying Sheri in his arms. She looked rough, bruised, her hair a mess, dress missing. She had a hospital gown on, and her leg was in a cast. 

 Jaime was grinning like there was no tomorrow. He stepped forward and gently sat Sheri down on the bed by my feet. I felt the tears starting to well up. I had been certain I was going to lose her. 

 She put on a brave smile, and reached for the hand I extended to her. 

 Jaime stood over her, protectively. "Jesus, Ace! Where'd you find this one? If I hadn't shown up in time, I think she was going to kill the lot of them herself. Friggin' maniac. Crazy girl was spitting out half a guy's ear before I managed to clean things up." 

 I looked down at her. 

 She grinned sheepishly. "No way I was going to portal again. We'd wipe together or not at all." She looked back at Jaime. "You never told me that our resident Witch-Doctor was a real-life barbarian." 

 Jaime was 6 feet 7 inches of rough and tumble. The left tackle on our high- school football team, and a loner, except for me and Dan. We'd gotten him out of trouble once, and we never could get rid of him ever since. Loyal as an old hound-dog. The fucker could write code like nobody's business. 

 He'd taken the bat from the guy coming out the door and laid half-a-dozen guys out cold before Mark showed up with the heavy artillery. One shot from his .45 stopped everything. Apparently in his wake, half the party had shown up in the alley, and the police were only a few minutes behind. The guys weren't about to wait, not with me bleeding on everybody, and a couple of minutes later we were loaded in the limo headed for the hospital. 

 With the story out of the way, everyone decided to give me a little space, especially when the busy-body nurse came in shrieking it was supposed to be only two at a time. 

 Which meant one at a time, since it looked like it would have taken a platoon of marines to get Sheri out of there. 

 I was alone with Sheri and her cousin, when Sandy had the brilliant idea of leaning over and giving me a hug, nearly killing me. "You big idiot. No more heroics." 

 "Don't you have a party to go back to?" I asked, teasing. 

 She wiped her eyes. "Right. That was Friday." 

 "Friday?" 

 Sheri squeezed my hand. "It's Sunday. You really had us worried." 

 "Shit. No wonder I'm so damned hungry. Sounds like you got something to eat. An ear?" 

 My girl grinned. "Tastes like shit. And believe me, getting eye goop from out from under your nails is next to impossible." 

 "Eye goop?" 

 Sandy giggled. "You've got to hear Jaime tell it. We must have made him repeat it at least a dozen times. Spider-Monkey girl was making mincemeat of the guy who stabbed you. She clawed one of his eyes clear out, bit off half his ear. She was going for the jugular when Jaime dragged her off the stupid bastard. Hardest shot he took all evening was from her elbow, and he almost lost a finger to those teeth of hers." 

 "It wasn't that bad," Sheri whined. "He only got a few stitches." She leaned forward. "I think he likes me." 

 "Don't let his wife hear that. She may not be much bigger than you, but I think she could take him, two out of three falls." 

 "Wife?" 

 "Yeah, he and Mark are both married. I'm surprised the women haven't shown up yet. I'm going to catch so much hell." 

 I tried to move and I got another blast of pain. 

 "Stop that!" Sheri snapped. "You'll tear the stitches, even if you don't start internal bleeding again." 

 "How bad was it?" I asked. 

 "If the idiot on top of you knew how to use a knife, you'd be dead now," she snapped. "Then where would I be, you stupid asshole? Why couldn't you have waited for the others?" 

 "They...they were touching you." 

 "So what? I've been touched before. More than touched. If you ever do anything that stupid again...I'll...oh Hell, I'll just die." 

 "How long will I be in here?" I asked. 

 "Couple of days. You had a pretty bad concussion, a collapsed lung, and lost a lot of blood. The knife got stuck in your ribs, or it would have been a lot worse." 

 She looked upset, and more than a little angry. 

 "What are you wearing under that robe?" I asked. 

 Sandy laughed out loud. "That's my cue to go. I'll give you two a couple of minutes alone. I think he's going to be just fine." 

 Sheri was glaring at me. "Did you really ask what I had on under this stupid robe?" 

 I nodded, grinning. "You promised the girls would entertain me." 

 "If you were good. In the limo. And I said maybe." 

 "Ok, 0 for 3," I pouted. "What have you got on under there?" 

 She giggled. "You are so bad. Panties. That's all. Not much of them either." 

 "You're killing me, beautiful. Half naked and only an arm's reach away." 

 "I'm still mad at you." 

 "I still love you." 

 She leaned her head down on my leg. "You big idiot. You could have died." 

 "Not when you have my back," I said. 

 "You made Jaime cry. I don't think I've ever seen a sadder thing. He was running down that alley, cradling you in his arms, blubbering like a baby." 

 I grinned. "Yes! He's sooo never going to live that one down." 

 She slapped me on the leg. "Asshole. He saved your life." 

 "Fine. I owe him one. He's still going to get razzed." 

 She looked over at the door, then bounced her butt up the bed a couple of feet, sending jolts of pain through my back. Whatever they were giving me wasn't near strong enough. 

 "Stop wincing you big baby," she said. 

 She grabbed my hand, and put it on her breast. I cupped it through her gown. 

 "Second base," she giggled. 

 "I don't think we've even got much of first base yet." 

 "You need to get healthy for me. I've got a lot of catching up to do, and the boobies and booty are dying for a little attention." 

 "How about a lot of attention?" I teased. 

 "How about, when the doctor clears you, we try for a home-run?" 

 * * * 

 It was more than a couple of days. Closer to a week. I never had a shortage of visitors, but at least they bathed and put on normal clothes. I got a serious tongue-lashing from Maria, for putting poor little Jaime in danger. Sheri's parents stopped by every day, as did Sandy. I think she had a little crush on me. I never escaped her without a kiss or two. Or three. Not when Robert accompanied her, but she nearly had me in a makeout session once. I gave her grief about it. She assured me that it was nothing serious, but she couldn't wait for me to get better for a real thank-you. 

 It was Sandy who told me about the change in Sheri. Apparently her issue with touching men was almost totally resolved. Part of it was me, another part was my posse. Sandy's therapist believes that fighting back against the attackers had the most to do with it. She no longer felt helpless or as vulnerable. 

 "Sheri and Maria are thick as thieves. They've been ganging up on poor Jaime. He bares it well. You should see them when they're sitting out in the waiting area, once girl perched on each of his legs. Sheri has no problem with physical contact with him." 

 "I'm going to have to kill him, you know." 

 Sandy grinned, and gave me another long lip-lock. She tasted of mint, and her tongue was friendlier than ever. "He's like a big cuddly teddy bear to her. She hasn't even kissed him. Now Dan..." 

 "What about Dan!" I growled. 

 "Lots of hugging and kissing going on there." 

 "That son-of-a-bitch..." 

 Her lips shut me up again. "Stop, silly. She feels bad he got so beat up for her. You were injured worse, but he still looks like a mess. She's always hugging him and kissing his 'boo-boos'. Mark and Jaime give him so much shit as soon as she's gone." 

 "Good." 

 She grinned then climbed on my bed, lying down facing me. "You've got great friends. I hope you realize that." 

 "I know. I couldn't ask for better." 

 "I hope you consider me and Robert friends," she said softly. 

 "Best friends. I love what you do for Sheri. She needs someone like you." 

 "It works both ways. I love her, you know." 

 "I know. It's pretty obvious." 

 She took my hand and placed it on her tit. I'm an asshole, I didn't pull it away. I liked the feel. "No, Steve. I love her. I've been in love with her for years." 

 You could have knocked me over with a feather. 

 She smiled, and I felt her hand sliding under the sheet, rubbing the erection she managed to give me every time she visited. "She couldn't stand a man's touch, you know. My touch was different." 

 "Is she...are you..." 

 "Lovers. Two years now. Toned it down since I met Robert. I'm not gay, and neither is she. She just needed me, and I guess I needed her." 

 Her hand was gripping my cock, and stroking it. "Once you two have settled down as a real couple, I hope you'll let me share her with you sometimes." 

 Share? Holy shit! "What about Robert?" 

 She leaned in and kissed me softly, her lips lingering. "That's what I love about you. Always thinking of other people, and doing the right thing. He knows about me and Sheri. She's getting better, but we've talked and there's no way she's interested in sex with anyone but you. Not for now. We'll see how things are after you two are married." 

 Married? "I...uh..." Damn this girl could leave me tongue tied. 

 "You're going to get married, and I get to be the matron of honor. Don't kid yourself that you're not. You're both crazy about each other. Sometimes I'm so fucking jealous. Of both of you." 

 Her lips were on mine, and I welcomed them, a little guilt still getting through. Her hand was driving me crazy, and I loved the feel of her hard little nipple. Our tongues played quietly, lovingly. "Can I finish you?" she asked softly. "I'd hate to leave you with blue-balls." 

 I looked toward the door. She licked my lips. "Dan's on guard. Nobody's getting through. Sheri is home, won't be here for a couple of hours. Let me do this for you." 

 "I feel like I'm cheating," I told her. 

 "God, you're so fucking adorable, I can't stand it," she said. She pulled free from me, then grabbed her purse. She turned away from me. "Sheri? I'm with Steve." 

 Son-of-a-bitch. 

 "He's fine. Looking a lot better. I've got him so worked up he's going to pop, but he wouldn't dream of cheating on you. Can you tell him it's alright?" 

 She handed me the phone. 

 "Sheri?" I asked. 

 "She's so bad! What's she been doing? She told you about us, didn't she? I'm so going to kill her." 

 "Uh, yeah, she told me you guys were, uh, intimate." 

 "You understand why?" 

 "Of course. Hell, no man or woman could resist you. What's this I hear about Dan getting all my kisses?" 

 I thought I could hear her blush over the phone. "Little kissies, that's all. No boobies, no booty, and certainly no kitty. Are you jealous?" 

 "Should I be?" 

 "Don't be. There's no man for me but you. I'm just, well, practicing flirting again. It's been a while. You know who I love." 

 "I can't wait to get out of here," I told her. 

 "I know. Me either. I'd take care of your...needs, but I don't want our first time to be like that. Not some stupid quickie in a hospital bed. I'm afraid I might need a lot of patience from you, understand?" 

 "Totally. I feel the same." 

 "Good. Then let Sandy do whatever she wants, or she's going to be driving me crazy. No kitty, alright? But if she offers it, you'd be a fool not to let her get her mouth on you. She's pretty incredible." 

 "Are you sure?" 

 "I trust her, and I trust you. Give her what she needs, and she'll tell me all about it tonight." 

 "This feels kind of crazy." 

 "I love you, baby. Have fun. Now put her on." 

 I handed the phone to a grinning Sandy. "Thank you, thank you," she gushed. "I will, I promise, tonight. Is this just the one time?" 

 She giggled. "Perfect. Love you babe." She hung up the phone, and went to the door. She poked her head out, then came back smiling from ear to ear. 

 "You're mine, until they release you. You have a problem with that, handsome?" 

 "Robert?" 

 She rolled her eyes at me. "Do I have to make another call? Or do you trust me that it's Ok. I'm not married yet." 

 "I trust you. I wouldn't want to hurt him, or your relationship, that's all." 

 "He knows that when I'm with you and Sheri, there'll probably be some you-and- me action going on. My ass is off-limits to you, that's his. Alright?" 

 I nodded, my mouth dry. 

 She gave me a quick kiss, then pulled the sheet down, and pushed my hospital gown out of the way. "God, you've got a nice one. I'm going to really enjoy this." 

 Not as much as I did. No preliminaries, she took me in her mouth and started sucking. I didn't last two minutes. She swallowed and kept going, until I was hard as a rock again. 

 "Good. We got that first one out of the way. Man you were backed up! I hope you don't always come like that. I don't mind a little taste but you almost drowned me." 

 "No, I don't always come like that. You had me pretty worked up, you know." 

 "The idea of doing two girls? Or just little old me?" 

 "All you, gorgeous. Not that the threesome idea isn't going to be driving me nuts for a while, but you're pretty incredible you know." 

 She grinned saucily. "I know. And now you're going to find out." 

 She got started again, then stopped abruptly. She grabbed her smart phone, set it up, and passed it to me. "Record it. It'll be even better than explaining it to her. I might even tease Robert with it later." 

 Was there no end to the day's surprises? 

 She was true to her word, and the second time around, she teased and pleased. Her mouth was wonderful, and ever so talented. I did manage to hold out for almost 10 minutes, before she cheated, putting my hand on her head, and insisting I fuck her mouth. The sweet girl had no gag reflex whatsoever, and a minute later I was painting her tonsils again. 

 She sucked me dry, opened her mouth showing a full-load to the camera, then took her time cleaning me with her mouth, until I was starting to stiffen again. I killed the video. 

 "There. That should keep you for a while. Was I Ok?" 

 "Ok? That was unbelievable!" 

 "Good. I'll be working with Sheri to make sure she can deliver at least as good. You're going to have to be patient with her. She's never done any of this stuff willingly. In many ways she's still a virgin." 

 She stood and gave me a salty kiss. Then she pulled up her shirt, and leaned over, placing her nipple in my mouth. "Give us a kiss goodbye, lover." 

 I got a nice little suck, until she replaced it with the other one. "No marks, Ok? No fair rubbing his face in it." 

 That put a little damper on my feelings, and I gave her nipple one last tongue swipe. "Thank you," I said. 

 "A hero's reward. Get used to being spoiled, lover." She gave me a parting kiss, straightened her shirt, and left me to let the others in. Dan and Mark were smirking. 

 "Lot of privacy," Dan observed. 

 "Yes. Thank you." 

 "Sheri..." 

 "Knows and is cool with it. We were just on the phone with her." 

 Mark laughed. "You lucky son-of-a-bitch. It's about time you got it right." 

 "Got what right?" 

 Dan answered. "Woman. Got the woman right. She's an angel. Perfect. No way you deserve her or whatever the supermodel's doing for you." 

 I had to laugh. He was right. "No argument from me. Third time's a charm, I guess." 

 * * * 

 It had taken me 5 days before they'd let me sit up and use a laptop. I was only online about 10 seconds before my buds started lightin' me up with messages. 

 From the first time back, I found things had changed. Not in the game, so much, although there were enough new things there. The change was in us. No one was playing solo, not even Jaime. On logging in, I'd find them working together in groups of 3 or 4. With a max party size of four, one of the guys would drop out to make room for me if necessary. 

 Things were easy, even in hardcore Hell mode. We worked as a finely tuned machine, each watching out for each other. CherryBomb was always at the center of each group. She coaxed, she goaded, she teased. She led. 

 The first time on, they made me switch from Skype to Ventrilo for voice chat. Jaime set up our private server, and the sound quality was even better and so much easier to join. 

 We were laughing, joking, teasing each other. We shared loot, traded cash, farmed as a group, and had more fun than I'd ever imagined outside of Beta. 

 At the end of each session, CherryBomb would announce the finish, and she and I would pop out of the game and onto video chat. 

 I'd made a few calls, and she'd received the order on my 3rd day after awaking. Every night she'd reward me. Tonight it was a red lace halter babydoll that only half covered her outstanding breasts. It barely reached her crotch, and had the cutest red thong. 

 "The girls want to thank you again. You didn't have to do this," she said, indicating her outfit. 

 "Sorry, Angel. It wasn't for you." 

 "You have to stop calling me Angel, you know I'm anything but. I don't want to be an Angel. I'm gonna be your little Devil. Can't you see I'm wearing red?" 

 "Sorry sugar. You saved my ass, and you'll always be my Angel. My guardian Angel." 

 She pouted. "Really? Would an Angel do this?" she asked, pulling her halter material to the outside, exposing her breasts. 

 "Heavenly tits," I teased. 

 She stuck her tongue out at me. She turned lifted the back of her outfit and wiggled her rear. "Angelic?" 

 I laughed, as she smacked her own tight little buns. "Hell no, Devil girl. Hellacious." 

 She grinned. "Good answer. When you coming home to me? I need you." 

 "Doctor's talking two more days." 

 "Sandy showed me the video. Looked like you enjoyed it. Was she good?" 

 "God, I was so desperate to get off, at first I couldn't even tell. It was a warm wet mouth." 

 She laughed. "Don't you dare ever tell that! She thinks she's God's gift to men and women. She's convinced she rocked your world." 

 "Don't get me wrong, Sheri. It was nice. But she's not who I wanted doing that." 

 Sheri grinned, moving closer to the camera, sucking on her finger. "Really? Now who could you possibly have in mind? You couldn't possibly want your 'Angel' to do such a naughty thing. Putting that big, hard, nasty thing in her innocent little mouth? I don't think it would even fit!"  

 

 

===

"Do you think my ornery Devil would like to give it a try?" 

 "Trust me, there's not much that your personal Devil wouldn't try for you. I'm not saying she'd want to do it more than once, but she'll give anything a try for you. Anything." 

 "You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you, don't you." 

 She laughed. "No shit. I think the whole world knows it by now." I saw a conflicted look cross her pretty face. "Where the hell were you 3 years ago?" 

 It was like I was knifed all over again. "Don't you think I wonder that myself?" 

 I saw the tears in her eyes. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Hell, you were married, and I was barely out of high-school. It's not on you." 

 "It is now. Nobody will hurt you again." 

 "Say it for me, Steve?" 

 "I love you, Sheri." 

 "Sheri? Or Cherry? Maybe you just love the gamer girl." 

 "One and the same, silly girl. The gamer girl was how I got to know you. The gorgeous little Devil has her claws in my heart, and I don't see how the hell I could ever win myself free, even if I wanted to." 

 She peeled off her babydoll, sitting there in that little thong. She rolled the chair back giving me a full view. "Yours, baby. Get well and come to me." 

 "Do the girls miss me?" 

 She cupped her tits in her hands, giving them a squeeze. "You know it. They want to reward you for all the sweet presents." 

 "How about the booty?" 

 She turned and got on her knees, wiggling her cute little butt. "What do you think?" 

 "I think I'm dying to introduce myself up close and personal." 

 "I'm going to tell the boys I made you kiss my ass." 

 "Make 'em jealous?" 

 "Damn straight. Let them eat their hearts out. All yours, baby. Only yours." 

 She leaned back in her chair, opening her legs. That tiny little thong was all that covered her magic. She reached down and pulled it to the side, sliding her fingers out of sight. She bit her lip, moaning loud enough for me to hear, pulling her fingers out, and showing the camera how wet they were. 

 "How do you do this to me?" she said, shaking her head. "The sound of your voice sets me off. I have to sit on a towel the whole time we're playing. I want you so bad." 

 "Soon, Sheri. I promise." 

 * * * 

 The last few days crawled by, with visits from friends, daily checkups, and late night gaming. Sheri came by each day, spending a couple of hours, lying on my bed with me, unless the nurse caught us. I don't think she was trying very hard. We'd talk, about our past, and about our dreams. We'd touch each other, gently caressing. I got to first base, and second base each day. She was driving me nuts. 

 Sandy was kind, and always made her visit after Sheri. She'd taken to wearing button-up blouses I could open and play with her braless tits. She'd give me a quick suck as soon as she got there, then we'd hang out, talking, a lot of it about Sheri, and the guys. She was absolutely fascinated by our relationship. 

 We were cuddling, our lips never far apart. "Robert doesn't have anyone like you guys have. Some friends, but nothing like the magic you guys share. You knew they'd be there for you. You never doubted it for a minute, did you?" 

 "Never thought about it. If it was physically possible, they'd be there for me. As I would for them. I'd sacrifice everything in my life except for Sheri, for any one of them." 

 "Yet all you do is tear each other apart, whenever you're together," she teased. 

 "Because we can. We'd never admit it, we can't you know, but under every insult, every tease, we're telling each other what we can't say out loud. We don't have to." 

 "You love them." 

 "Words. Everyone talks about love. A lot of it's shit. Absolute trust. We always put each other first." 

 "Can you do that with Sheri?" she asked. 

 I pulled her close, and sampled her soft lips, looking into her hazel eyes. I'd started out so conflicted, every time we were alone together, but it was comfortable now. Natural. Strange, with the issues I'd had with women. Sheri had crept up on me, but Sandy? It didn't make sense, but I wasn't going to trouble myself about it. I liked her and trusted her. Weird. 

 "She's already there. It's not just me, either. She's won over Dan and Jaime already. Mark will get there. Jaime's the surprising one. He doesn't warm up to anyone." 

 She nibbled on my bottom lip. "He saw her. How she fought for you. She could have run. She should have, but she wouldn't leave you, even though she didn't know about the others coming, like you did. Alone, she didn't stand a chance, and she fought like hell. She'd sacrifice it all for you. How could he not love her?" 

 "It was stupid. She should have run." 

 "Love, Steve. She couldn't. Just like you couldn't. Like the guys couldn't. I can only imagine what that would be like. I'm jealous. I shouldn't be, I love her, but I can't help it." 

 I pulled her close, hugging her, ignoring the twinge in my back. "You have her. Therefore you have me and mine. Just like Jaime's Maria, or Mark's Angela. I know what you've done for her. What you mean. I love you for that." 

 "And Robert?" she asked. 

 "With time, I hope. He'll be family." I loved her concern for him. It made me feel better about what we were doing. 

 She buried her head in my shoulder, "Get well. We need a bigger bed." 

 I held her until she got antsy, and she pulled out of my arms and squirmed down the bed, taking my cock into her sweet generous mouth. She was different, loving, slow, gentle. After a few minutes, she took a break, stroking me slowly. 

 "Do you think about her, when I'm doing this?" 

 "Sometimes. Not in the last couple of minutes. It's not that I'm feeling guilty. I wonder how it's going to be. If she'll actually be able to do it. Do you think of her?" 

 She licked me slowly. "Yes. Both her and Robert. What it'll be like to share you with her. Helping her. How Rob could let me do this, welcome it, for her sake. I don't think I could do that. He's better than I deserve." 

 Hearing his name gave me pause. I knew that Sheri accepted things, but I only had Sandy's word for Robert. "Should we stop?" I asked, reaching down and caressing her beautiful face?" 

 "Only if you want to put it somewhere else. I'd still rather save that until it's the three of us. Put if you'd prefer..." 

 "Suck me, beautiful lady." 

 She smiled and took me in her mouth again, a little more aggressively. She normally like to play a lot the second time, but she seemed determined to get me off, and I wasn't fighting it. I let her drive me crazy, sucking like her life depended on it. It only took a few minutes before I was rewarding her efforts again. 

 "God, you are amazing. I don't deserve you." 

 She licked her lips teasingly. "No, you're right, you deserve so much more, and luckily for you, you're going to get it." 

 Maria showed up early the day before I was supposed to check out. I'd had a rough night. They'd reduced my pain meds, and I'd aggravated one of the cuts in my back during the night. It meant some new stitches. I guess I was grouchy. 

 She started tearing into me, as she did almost always. What was I thinking getting everyone involved? Jaime especially. Was I done playing recluse? Would the gaming finally stop and everyone could get a life? What were my plans for Sheri? When was I going to get back to doing something with my life? 

 "Please, Maria. Not today. I'm not in the mood." 

 "It's always about your mood, isn't it, Steven? It's always about you." 

 I sighed. "I'm sorry, Maria. My intention has never been to get between you and Jaime. I know you don't like me, and I can't help that. But Jaime will always be more than a friend to me." 

 She looked shocked. "You think I don't like you? Why?" 

 I laughed. "It's obvious isn't it? Have you had a kind word for me in four years?" 

 "If you weren't such an ass, maybe I would," she snapped. 

 "As I said..." 

 "God, you are such a fool! You don't have any idea, do you?" 

 "Idea?" I asked. 

 She rolled her eyes. "Lord save us from the ignorant." She leaned over and planted her lips on mine, kissing me hard. "I love you, you idiot. We all do. God help us." 

 "Then why?" 

 "It's how we play the game. You're supposed to know. How can we love one of you, and not all of you? There's the problem, isn't it? You must know how the guys feel about Sheri? It's all part of what we are. For each other." She grinned. "The four musketeers, all for one, and one for all." 

 I smiled back, surprised by her words. I did what we always did. Joke. "Kinky." 

 She slapped me playfully. "Such. An. Ass." 

 "Agreed. But it's all Jaime's," I answered, reaching out and patting, her hip. 

 "Always. Jealous much?" 

 "Who wouldn't be?" 

 She grinned. "She's good for you. It's about fucking time you did something right. If you fuck this up, your ass is mine, Steven Jeffery. You hear me?" 

 "Sorry, did you say something? I'm still trying to get past that kiss." 

 She laughed, then hugged me. She didn't let go, and after a bit I could feel her trembling. "Don't you ever scare me like that again." 

 "Last thing I'd ever want to do. Trust me gorgeous. It's not as fun as it looks." 

 She pulled away, held my face her hands, and kissed me long and hard. "Get better, baby. We need you back." 

 She left me shortly after, and I was thinking I could use another visit by Sandy. It was a day for surprises. 

 * * * 

 I got a few hours of game play in that evening. It was good. I still was avoiding anything hardcore, playing off a laptop, but we did manage to get to Act IV Inferno mode, and cleaned up. I thought we were going to make it to the end, but it was getting late, and I needed my rest. I was still looking for some private time with my girl. 

 We popped out to Skype and Sheri was waiting, dressed in her latest. A sheer pink babydoll, strapless, trimmed in black lace. Jesus, she looked hot. 

 "You like? This might be my favorite," she said, posing for me. 

 "Mine too. Not much support for the girls." 

 She laughed. "None at all. Sometimes they like to feel free." 

 I saw movement, and suddenly Sandy was standing behind my girl, dressed in the black gold bustier and v-string panty I'd bought for Sheri. "Hi Steven. Thanks for the outfit," she said grinning. 

 "Looks great on you, beautiful." 

 "Your girl's awfully lonely. Hope you don't mind if I keep her company." 

 "Not at all." 

 She was hugging Sheri from behind, and I saw her hands slide up inside her outfit. Sheri leaned back against her friend, and smiled when Sandy's hands reached her tits. 

 "I wish you were here, baby. I miss you so much." 

 "One more day." 

 Sandy's lips were on my girl's neck. "What's your plan for tomorrow?" 

 "Dan's got me a place for the next few weeks. They've got my office set up, and shipped some of the stuff up here." 

 Sandy looked up and smiled. "Big bed?" 

 "California King," I assured her. 

 "Mmm. Can't wait. You won't make me wait too long, will you, handsome? I know you're going to want some private time, but don't lock me out." Sandy grinned. 

 I laughed. "I'm gonna let Sheri make that call. But I'm looking forward to it." 

 "You and me? Or me and Sheri?" 

 "Yes. Most definitely." 

 Sheri turned and kissed Sandy on the lips. Long and slow. Damn, I needed to get out of that damn hospital room. 

 Sheri lifted her arms, and Sandy pulled her top off. "We're going to cut you off, honey," Sandy said, facing the camera. "No early preview at what you're going to see live. Sorry." 

 "Just a peek?" I pleaded. 

 Sheri laughed. "No way. Get well and come to me, love. I need you." 

 Sandy turned to put herself between the camera and Sheri, her back to me. Sheri dropped to her knees, and I watched her slide Sandy's panties down, showing me her absolutely perfect ass. Sheri peeked around her friends hip, smiling. She reached up and got two hands full of firm butt. "Can you believe the body on her? And it's all ours." 

 Sandy looked over her shoulder grinning. "You still here, naughty boy? Go to bed now. Sweet dreams, loverboy." She turned and reached for the keyboard, and the screen went blank. 

 Damn. Rotten tease. Both of them. 

 I REALLY needed to get out of that place. 

 ======================= 

 The conclusion of the Gamer Goddess series follows shortly. Completed and in final edit. Again, I hope you've enjoyed the story so far. Thanks.

============================== 

 Gamer Goddess Surrenders 

 As mentioned in chapter 1, this story is very online-gaming-centric. It uses a lot of concepts, vocabulary and acronyms from games, especially Diablo 3, which this story revolves around. 

 This chapter's a little less voyeuristic than the first two, so I went with the Group Sex category. It's just a recurring threesome. Could have been Romance, Erotic Couplings or even Loving Wives. I even gave thought to First Time, although 'technically' it wasn't her first. I'm sure you, the reader will let me know if I got it wrong. 

 ============================== 

 I had one last checkup with my doctor, and was given strict directions on how to take care of my wounds. I was forced to take the obligatory wheelchair ride, with a large escort. Dan, Jaime, Sandy, Maria, Angela, even Carolyn, Sheri's Mom. I was kind of disappointed that Sheri wasn't there. 

 Sandy leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "Cheer up, handsome. How about a little smile. You're finally free." 

 I forced a smile and Angela grabbed my hand and gave me a squeeze. "Lousy timing asshole. All the excitement, and I'm stuck in Spain. Next time give a girl a little heads up, Ok?" 

 I laughed. "Sorry. What was I thinking? I promise, no more late night stabbings unless you're no more than a couple of hours away. Deal?" 

 "No more late night stabbings period, dickbreath. Do I have to take you home and lock you in my attic, to keep you safe?" 

 "Maybe just on Tuesdays and Thursdays," I told her, grinning. 

 "You know Tuesdays and Thursdays are Mark's training nights." 

 "Yes I do." 

 She grinned, looking around at the crowd walking with us. "What are you saying, rotten man?" 

 "Maybe you and me should spend some more time together," I teased. 

 She leaned down and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "I thought you didn't like Maria and me. Stealing your guys away." 

 I grabbed her hand, holding it. "I've been an ass. You know my issues. Forgive me?" 

 Her smile was touching. "Nothing to forgive. Good to see you back. I think we all owe your girl a lot." 

 "Tuesdays and Thursdays?" I chuckled. 

 "Right. I heard what she did to the last guy that messed with you. No chance I'm getting on her bad side." She squeezed my hand. "Besides, you couldn't handle this." 

 I was loaded into the Limo, Mark driving again, with Dan, Jaime, Maria and Angela joining me in the spacious interior. I was still sore and tender, and looked at Dan. His face was a rainbow of bruises. 

 "Gotta tell you, buddy. The new look is an improvement." 

 "Eat shit and die, asshole," he laughed. 

 I had left Jaime alone, most of the last week, but the opportunity was too good. "Sheri tells me that one of those guys hit you so hard, he left you crying like an 8 year old. Tiny little girl beating the hell out of the bunch of 'em, and you're watering the alley." 

 He blushed before responding. "Tears of laughter. Seeing you lying there like a little bitch, whining over a few pin-pricks, while you left your girlfriend to the do the heavy lifting. Just like in game." 

 That got a laugh out of everyone. I was out of practice, on the losing end against Jaime of all people. What was the world coming to? 

 We talked a little about our latest business venture, which Dan, Jaime and Mark were all invested in. Angela handled Mark's money and investments so the entire team was together for the first time in a week. I got updated on the status of our deal, with the papers signed, and first cash payments paid out, we were putting one of our guys on staff, and doing some deeper research into their technology. It had Jaime working with them on site, and Dan attending their staff meetings. 

 We hadn't been this involved in a new business effort in years. Then again, $40 million was a lot of money. My share was almost a quarter of my worth, a huge risk. Oddly, I hadn't given it a thought in the last week, even with all my free time. 

 We pulled up to the Carlyle, where I learned that Dan had moved me into one of their two-bedroom suites, with a remarkable view of Madison Avenue. I was a little nervous about the expense. Sure, money wasn't a problem, but a couple of weeks there would probably buy a luxury car. 

 Dan reassured me the cost was reasonable, only around two grand, unlike the central tower suites which ran better than $8k a day. What a bargain. 

 Inside the lobby, I said goodbye to everyone except Dan who escorted me to my suite. He handed me my keycard, and gave me a pat on the shoulder. "Don't strain yourself. Take it easy for a few days. Use the amenities here, you're paying for them." 

 "Office setup?" 

 "Complete. New gear, matching your old, Jaime configured everything. You're good to go." 

 I opened the door, and he stayed behind. I looked at him curiously, but he just grinned. "You got it from here." 

 I walked past a small kitchenette and powder room into the luxurious living room. It wasn't going to be too tough to stick it out a while. Beautifully laid out, tasteful furniture, fireplace, and a stunning view from the 12th floor. I saw a door to my left, and looked in to a fully furnished office. The bed had been removed, and dual desks had been installed, face to face, each fully outfitted with a computer station and 32" monitors. 

 Back through the living room, I found the entrance to the bedroom. I opened the door and smiled. 

 "Hey sailor, in port for long?" Sheri asked, stretched out on the king-size bed. 

 She was wearing one of her new outfits, a cobalt blue lace halter style babydoll, that showed off her beautiful breasts to their best advantage. Mostly sheer, with flowery designs throughout. 

 "They'll let anybody in this place, won't they?" 

 "You don't know the half of it. I had to fight off half-a-dozen sluts to keep you to myself." 

 "You've always been a hell of a fighter." 

 "Miss me?" she asked, squirming sexily. 

 "You have no idea, gorgeous." 

 She laughed sweetly. "I'd say I have a very good idea." 

 She got up, and slipped into my arms. She tilted her head up and I kissed her, softly at first, then more passionately, until I groaned under the pain of a tight hug. I'd have to remind her to avoid the actual wounds. Wasn't worth interrupting the hug over. 

 "Pussy," she teased, working my tie, and the buttons of my shirt free. I was dressed casually, clothing the guys had brought me for the trip home, so I wouldn't be stuck wearing my tux. 

 My torso was completely wrapped, and she walked around me, her hands fluttering against my skin, her lips pressing against my back. "Don't you ever scare me like that again," she whispered. 

 "I'll try not to." 

 Her lips pressed against my shoulder, as her arms wrapped around my body, undoing my belt and opening my pants. 

 I had been told she was past her contact-with-males issue, but this was still surprising. She dropped to her knees, leaned over and untied my laces. She nudged my leg up, and pulled off my shoes, one at a time. Still on her knees, she pulled my pants down, leaving me in my boxers and socks. 

 Sheri drew me over to the bed, getting me to sit, and removed my socks. She ran her hands slowly up my legs, gently, lovingly. At my thighs she looked up at me. "You gave me this. This ability." She leaned over and kissed my skin, tenderly. 

 I lay back and relaxed while she took her time becoming acquainted with my body. She avoided my boxers but a few minutes later her lips were on my neck, her soft body pressed against mine. My face was bathed in kisses, before her lips finally met mine. 

 I don't know how long we spent there, quietly kissing, our lips joined, our breath one. Her tongue was gentle and tentative, then more forceful, teasing, battling, exploring. 

 Our lips separated, my eyes boring into hers. "I love you, Sheri." 

 She grinned. "No shit, Sherlock. I think you've made that pretty obvious. The whole fucking city knows about it by now. The man who'd fight three guys for his girl, ending up half-dead in the hospital for a week." 

 "If you hadn't destroyed that one guy, I doubt it would have been newsworthy." 

 She kissed me again. "I'm yours, big guy. What are you going to do with me?" She got up on her knees, and peeled off her top, sitting there in small blue lace panties. I started to rise, but she pushed me back down and brought her tits to my face. "The girls have been dying for this moment," she giggled. 

 I kissed, fondled, and sucked away to my heart's content. She appeared to enjoy it, moaning sweetly. Her nipples were hard, standing up proud, and received more than their share of attention. 

 Sheri backed away, and moved off of me. She pulled off her panties, then moved to my waist and pulled my boxers down. She was staring at my hard cock, and her hand moved forward tentatively, a single finger reaching out and touching me cautiously. She kept her eyes on it, lying down beside me, her fingers floating across my skin. 

 Her breath was loud, heavy. She wrapped her fingers around my shaft and shivered. I held her close, my hand stroking her back. 

 "Relax, baby. We don't have to do everything at once," I told her. 

 She shook her head. "I want to. I need to, Steve." 

 Sheri scooted down for a better view, her hand stroking me ever-so-slowly. Her grip loosened, and she curled her hand around the crown, her palm smearing my pre-cum across the head. 

 "It feels so weird," she murmured. "An iron rod, wrapped in velvety skin. Hard and soft." She looked up at me. "I want to do it. Can we?" 

 "I'd love to," I confessed. "You're sure?" 

 "Absolutely." 

 I'd love to say it was the greatest ever. The culmination of all my dreams. Perfection personified. 

 It was horrible. 

 She straddled me nervously, holding me upright. She lowered herself and as soon as my skin touched hers, she started shaking and was soon sobbing, crying inconsolably. I drew her down into my arms, and she pulled away, rolling onto her side, her back to me. 

 I left her alone for a few moments, before placing my hand on her shoulder. When she didn't struggle, I closed in behind her, holding her. I didn't say anything. 

 She got herself together and turned into my arms, pressing her head into my neck. "I'm sorry. It'll get better." 

 I hushed her. "We're rushing things. Take it easy. I love being here with you. Don't force it. I love you and I'm in no hurry. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with you, Angel. Time is not an issue." 

 "I...I thought I was ready." 

 We cuddled, kissed, and I was surprised when she wanted to try again. It was only slightly better. I actually settled the head between her lips before she lost it. 

 After that, we stayed in bed for a while, holding each other, before getting up. I was suffering a pretty bad case of blue-balls, but wasn't about to say anything. 

 We got dressed, and had a meal in the restaurant. I sent her off to the spa for some spoiling and relaxation, while I returned to the suite and checked on emails, trying to get a little work done. 

 She was in a great mood when she returned to the suite. She was glowing, laughing, and leaped into my arms, stealing a kiss. 

 "Game time?" I asked. 

 "Hell yeah! We need to kick Diablo's ass in inferno. You've been slacking and we're behind." 

 She got comfortable, wearing a t-shirt and panties. I dressed in shorts and a jersey. Turned out she'd had time to get setup, had her home keyboard and mouse hooked up. Our machines where back-to-back, and we sat down, facing each other. If I sat up high, I could see her over the top of the monitor. 

 The guys were online, and Dan offered to sit out the final battle. He'd already completed it solo, and with a couple of teams. For the rest of us it would be the first time. 

 We started about 3 save points from the end, to get warmed up. Half-an-hour later we were ready to face the final nemesis. With all the issues we had getting there, he went down remarkably easily, taking only about 5 minutes. We worked like a well-oiled machine, the two cannons firing from a distance, while Cherry and I took care of the melee. We had to be careful, and timed our moves to the animations, warning us before each of his big moves, giving us a chance to interrupt them. None of us died. When he went down, we were whooping it up, laughing. The loot was nothing to brag about, but we'd done it. End game. 

 We bowed out of team play, and Sheri and I switched to our softcore alts, and went after him again. It was a little more difficult, with me running my Demon- hunter and Cherry playing her barbarian. It took a good 10 minutes, and it was close a couple of times, but we did take him down, talking throughout, planning our strategies, advising each other on our strategies and planned moves. 

 I was ready to do some hardcore farming, when Sheri insisted on a break. "We're going to dinner," she told me. 

 I was a little surprised. I thought we'd just spend some time together, relaxing but I realized my life wasn't my own anymore. We got dressed, with Sheri taking only about half-an-hour to get ready. My preparations were simple enough. Shirt, slacks and tie, another dose of pain-killers. Turned out we had reservations in-house. We were escorted to a candle-lit table, where Sandy and Robert were waiting. They both stood and welcomed us with hugs. 

 Dinner was pretty amazing. The company was wonderful. Robert and I discussed what we did for a living. He was a lawyer, and I was stunned. The first lawyer I'd met that I could stand, to be honest. I even told him as much, and he laughed. He knew every lawyer joke ever made, and regaled us with a few. Robert was in mergers and acquisitions, and was familiar with the legal team I'd worked with on our latest investment. I knew that in the future, Robert's firm would at least get a shot at working with me. 

 We lingered over our second bottle of wine and coffee. They were fun to be with, comfortable. I was feeling no pain, literally, by the time we were ready to call it an evening. 

 I offered to have them come up and visit, but Robert excused himself. He kissed the girls goodbye, and insisted I meet with him for lunch in the upcoming week. 

 

 Sandy agreed to join us, and we headed back up. I thought it was nice that the elevator operator, with his elegant white gloves, remembered us. 

 "Your floor, Mr. Jeffery?" 

 "Please," I glanced at his nametag, "William." 

 He nodded, tipped his hat to the ladies who were chatting quietly. In the room, we settled into the living room, and Sandy hopped on the phone, ordering champagne and a snack from room service. 

 I was sitting between the two beauties, when Sandy hung up the phone and pulled her dress all the way up to her waist before straddling me. 

 "So it didn't go so well the first time," she said nonchalantly. "What do you say we play around and see what she is comfortable with? We can work our way up to the big finale. Nobody here is in that big a rush are they?" She was grinding away on my lap, her arms casually resting on my shoulders, looking me in the eye. 

 "No hurry here," I told her. I looked over at Sheri, "That alright with you?" 

 She nodded slowly. "I'm sorry..." 

 Sandy leaned over and gave her a kiss on the lips, shutting her up. "No sorries, silly girl. We're both ecstatic to see how far you've gotten. No need to go crazy the first night. Let's drag it out." 

 She sat back upright, and ran her fingers through my hair. "Now don't think I'm selfish, but I figured maybe you both could play with me. Nobody seems to have a problem with that. Then anything you two want to do together can be an offshoot of that." 

 I think my grin was answer enough for her. She turned toward Sheri. "That work for you?" 

 Sheri leaned against me, reaching out and running her hand down Sandy's side. "I'd like that." 

 "Good," Sandy said. "The zipper's on the back. Undress me for your man." 

 Sheri stood up and moved behind her best friend. She slowly drew the zipper down, her lips brushing Sandy's shoulder as it was slowly uncovered. Then she gripped the bottom of Sandy's dress, and pulled it up and over her head, leaving her sitting on my lap, completely naked. 

 "Oops!" Sandy giggled. "I guess I forgot underwear. I hope you both will forgive me." 

 Sheri dropped to her knees, her arms wrapped around Sandy's waist. I wish I could see what was going on behind her. I leaned forward and took a nipple in my mouth, sucking on it, feeling the nipple harden. She had amazing tits, high and firm, smaller than Sheri's but perfect on her body. 

 The doorbell to the suite rang at that moment. Of course. Sheri stood, grabbed my jacked and wrapped it around Sandy's shoulders, then went to the door. A moment later a bellboy was wheeling in a cart, with a bottle of champagne, and a plate of chocolate covered cherries. Sheri signed for it, while the young man's eyes tried to burn a hole through Sandy's impromptu cover-up. She was leaning against me, still straddling my lap, her long, luscious legs exposed. Her head was resting on my shoulder, watching the poor boy. He walked the cart right into a chair, apologizing and blushing profusely. 

 As soon as he was gone, Sandy hopped off of me, shedding the jacket. She grabbed the handle of the cart that had been left behind, and started steering it to the bedroom. "Let's go," she laughed, "and two people here are wearing way too much clothing." 

 In minutes there were three of us naked on the bed, cuddling and kissing, with Sandy in the middle. Sheri and I took turns kissing and feeding her, then kissing and feeding each other. If we spent too much time away from Sandy, she reminded us. 

 It was better. Playful, casual. Lots of touching and fondling, kissing and licking. Nothing overtly sexual, except for a lot of breast play. 

 I was achingly hard, and Sandy was kind enough to notice. "Did you try to blow him earlier?" she asked her cousin. 

 Sheri shook her head no. 

 "Well I'm going to. If you want, come on down here. Any time you feel like helping, jump in." 

 With no more adieu than that, she squirmed her way down the bed, and took me in her mouth. Sheri laughed. "Looks like you're pretty comfortable down there." 

 Sandy pulled off with a loud sucking pop. "Twice a day for the last few, thanks to you. You'd get him all worked up, and leave me to clean up after you. Looks like you did it again. He's ready to pop any moment." 

 Sheri blushed. "Damn! I...I guess I should have helped him finish when I couldn't go through with the whole thing." 

 Sandy giggled. "No sweat. Good for him to get teased a bit. We spoil him too much anyway. We'll finish this one off quick, and then we have the whole night ahead of us." She gave me a lick. "Kiss it?" she said to Sheri. 

 Sheri leaned over and pressed her lips quickly to the shaft. She looked up at me, grinning, and brought her face down again, kissing it more slowly, several small kisses, working her way upward, until she placed a kiss on the very top. 

 Sandy moved in and did the same on the opposite side, her final kiss extended, her lips slowly opening, as she took me into her mouth. She bobbed up and down a couple of times, then pulled back, and pointed my cock toward Sheri. 

 Sheri was a little hesitant, but she kissed the crown a couple of times, her tiny tongue reaching out and running along the bottom ridge, making me moan. She looked up nervously, then smiled. 

 "Yeah, he enjoyed that. It takes a lot for me to get him to moan that way. I think he likes you," Sandy said. 

 It took a few minutes, with Sandy doing most of the work, but Sheri did, at one point, take me in her mouth for a moment, before pulling away. 

 "Jesus, that was nice, Sheri," I gasped. 

 She giggled. "I'm hardly doing anything," she said. 

 "Maybe, but it's you doing it," I told her. 

 I was dying, and Sandy took pity on me. She sucked me for real, taking me deep, working her tongue. Sheri's hand reached down to the base, moving up and down just a couple of inches.  

 

 

===

"Soon," I gasped. 

 Sandy kept going, and before much longer I was shooting in her mouth. She let me finish there, swallowing most, but letting a little drip out over the head and shaft. 

 Sheri's fingers moved away, then one hesitant forefinger reached out and touched the milky mess, pulling away, then reaching back and coating it. She held it out to Sandy, who opened her mouth, and Sheri slipped her finger between the pretty girl's lips. 

 Sandy sat up, and reached for Sheri, pulling her up so they were face-to-face. "Look at me, beautiful," she said softly. 

 Their eyes were locked on one another, then Sandy leaned closer, until their lips were touching. I saw their mouths open, and their tongues pressing together. A few moments later they pulled apart. "Did you taste him?" 

 Sheri nodded her head slowly. 

 Sandy leaned down and placed her mouth over my cock, sucking me clean, then sat up again, and pulled Sheri's mouth to hers. They kissed longer, eyes closed, holding each other. 

 "Is that Ok?" Sandy asked softly, as they parted. 

 Sheri nodded, smiling. "Hot." 

 "Great. Next time maybe we'll let you taste it a little more directly." She hugged her cousin. "Do you think it would bother you to see him fuck me?" 

 Sheri was slow to respond, then whispered, "I don't think so." 

 "Then let's get him hard again. I've been dying to feel that thing inside me." 

 They played, and before long, Sandy had Sheri actually sucking me a few times. She pushed her away after the third time. "Not too much. I don't want you getting too comfortable, too fast. That would mean less play time for me. And you owe me." 

 Sheri, laughed, and after a few seconds, pushed her cousin away. "Share, piggy. He is mine, you know." 

 God bless Sandy. She knew exactly what to do to get her cousin's mind off the implications of what she was doing, and into a playful, less tense mood. 

 It became almost a tutorial after that, teaching Sheri how to do things better. "Look at him when you do it. They love that shit," Sandy whispered. 

 Sheri had her mouth around my cock, and looked up at me. I tensed up in her mouth and she pulled away quickly. "He moved!" 

 Sandy laughed. "Of course. You're driving him crazy. We better stop soon if I'm going to get any fun out of it, or he'll come as soon as he's in me." 

 Sheri wriggled up the bed, and kissed me on the lips. "Was that Ok?" 

 I laughed, pulling her close and kissing her hard. "Amazing. You?" 

 She grinned, nodding. "I can do that. I think I can do that a lot." 

 "Best girlfriend ever," I told her, stealing another kiss. 

 Sandy climbed up to the other side of me, swiping a kiss of her own. "Almost time. You want to see something really naughty, Steve?" 

 "I'm certain the answer is yes. How naughty?" 

 "Very, very naughty. You're sweet little innocent girlfriend is going to go down on me, getting me ready to take that monster of yours inside my itty-bitty tight hole." She turned to Sheri, "Aren't you, sweet cheeks?" 

 Sheri blushed. "This is kind of embarrassing," she said softly. 

 "I would love to see it. I've been thinking about that constantly for the last few days. Please, for me?" I pleaded. 

 "You don't think it's...oh I don't know...wrong? Perverted?" Sheri asked hesitantly. 

 "I think it's amazing. I think it's wonderful. Hell, I think it may damn well be the hottest thing I could imagine. Drive her crazy, and then let me finish her." 

 Sheri smiled. "I can do that, you know. I can drive her absolutely crazy. Make her scream for release. Beg me." She gave me a quick kiss. "Shall I do that for you? Take her to the edge. Over and over, deprive her of her release, make her squirm and plead. Then you can pound her into a little moist puddle." 

 Sandy moaned. "Shit. I don't need warming up anymore, I can do him now." 

 Sheri crawled across me. "No way! You're mine now. It's my turn to be in charge." 

 She did exactly what she said she would. It took her a good ten minutes or so, but Sandy was begging her, pleading, crying out for release. 

 Sheri climbed on top of her, in a 69. "Make me come," she demanded of her cousin. "Until I come, you don't get yours." 

 I watched in awe, slowly stroking my cock, keeping myself ready for my turn. 

 Sandy obviously had Sheri's number, and it was only a couple of minutes later that Sheri was coming for her cousin. Once she'd calmed down, she grabbed Sandy's hips and rolled with her, so that Sandy was on top, with Sheri's head and Sandy's ass toward the end of the bed. Sheri looked up at me, looked at my cock, then at Sandy's tight pink opening. 

 I moved up behind her and Sheri reached out a hand, stopping me. Her mouth opened and latched onto Sandy's clit, making the beauty moan. "Please," she gasped, "I did what you asked..." 

 Sheri's head was moving, her mouth torturing her cousin. She looked up at me, her hand reaching out and grabbing my thigh, pulling me forward. 

 Sandy was trembling, moaning continuously. I guided my cock to Sandy's opening, scant inches from Sheri's eyes. I pressed the head in, waiting for the go ahead. 

 I couldn't see what Sheri did, but Sandy tensed up, crying out, "Yes!" 

 Sheri gave me a tug, "Now!" she barked. 

 I slammed my cock in as hard as I could, and Sandy screamed. I pounded her hard, and felt her exploding around my cock, her pussy squeezing down hard, legs kicking. I watched her hands grab the headboard, the tendons on her arm straining, as her entire body went taut. I rammed my cock all the way in, grinding against her, and felt Sheri's teasing tongue lapping away where I entered her best friend and lover. 

 It looked like Sandy was coming down, but she tensed up again, gasping, pressing back against me. I kept myself buried to the hilt, corkscrewing inside of her. "Ahhhh!" she groaned, before her body relaxed, slowly, as if we were letting the air out of her. A few seconds later she was lying down, gasping. "Holy Christ," she gasped. 

 I slowly long-stroked her, enjoying her sweet body, filling the full depths of her pussy. I grabbed her hips, and pulled her up and back, to get better access, for a moment forgetting about Sheri down below. Sheri shifted with her, and I could look down past my cock on the out-stroke, and see Sheri watching my cock fill our play-thing. 

 "You Ok?" I asked softly. 

 She looked up at me and smiled. "That was intense. Too huge ones back to back for her. I think she liked that." 

 I grinned. "Man, you really had her going." 

 She lifted her head, and I felt her tongue flicking where I entered that tight little pussy. "Always. I'm not a total innocent." 

 She was watching my cock again. "It doesn't seem like it should fit. That doesn't hurt her?" 

 "Tell her Sandy. Am I hurting you?" 

 "Fuck yeah. The best damn hurt in the world. You can hurt me like this all you want lover. You fill me so fuckin' good." 

 "I'm going to fuck you hard now," I warned her. "I can't help myself. You're friggin' amazing." 

 "Pound me. Hammer that pussy," she demanded. 

 I inched my knees forward, got a good grip on her hips, then put my hips into overdrive, fucking her as hard and fast as I could, hammering her, just like she'd asked. 

 She moaned, and started grunting every few strokes, the grunts growing in intensity and frequency. After a couple of minutes I was getting tired, but I thought she was close, and wanted to get her to come for just me. I leaned over her, gasping, feeling the tension in my thighs and abs. I slowed down a little, and finished harder, stabbing that sweet little pussy. I grabbed her by the hair, twisting it and pulling her head backwards. "F..F..Fuck m...me," she gasped. 

 I felt the trembling in her legs, and I knew I had her. "Come for me," I growled. 

 She whined, her voice getting louder and higher pitched, until she made that same "Ahhhh!" groan, and she came for me. Rather than stop this time, I fucked her through it, punishing that pussy, ramming hard and deep. When she was finished, I slowed down to a nice easy steady stroke, releasing her hair. 

 I pulled out of her a few seconds later, and rolled over onto my back. "Ride me, beautiful. Make me come for you." 

 She moved slowly, her shaking leg stretching across my body. "God, that was good," she told me, before she took my cock in her hand, and lowered herself onto my shaft. "Oh, yeah," she moaned as she settled down. 

 Sheri climbed up next to me, her head on my shoulder. "You like it this way?" she asked softly. 

 I laughed. "I like it all ways, but that last bit took a little out of me. I needed a break." 

 Sandy was rocking back and forth on my cock, a little smile on her lips. "You want some of this, Sher? It's good. Really good." 

 "Not quite yet. I'm enjoying this. Fuck his brains out, Sandy." 

 Sheri got up and knelt beside us, her hands caressing her cousin. "This looks so amazing, watching you fuck him. I...I didn't know it would be this hot." 

 Sandy settled back on my cock with a wiggle, and started swiveling her hips. "I know. I can't wait to see him on you. He's going to go crazy." 

 Sheri spanked Sandy's butt. "We should have brought Buster. I wouldn't mind a turn on you myself." 

 Sandy laughed. "Who says we didn't? Check the bottom drawer, left side." 

 Sheri hopped up and ran to the dresser while Sandy rode me gently, easily. 

 Sheri was laughing. "When?" 

 "When we were setting up your computer." 

 I looked over and saw my girlfriend strapping some webbing around her waist, and when she turned around, she had a substantial rubber cock sticking out in front of her. "Damn, we're going to tear you up, girl." 

 I looked at it with a little trepidation. "As long as that's only for you two," I said. 

 Sheri walked over, wiggling her hips, the artificial cock waving in lazy circles. "What's the matter, lover? Afraid of a little backdoor action? I promise I'll be gentle." 

 I looked up to see if she was joking. She had a teasing look on her face that made me more than a little nervous. "We'll have to see about that," I said. "Nothing I've ever done, or had any inclination toward doing. Nowhere near drunk enough to even give it a thought." 

 She laughed. "Don't worry, baby. This is all for our little sex slave. Maybe a little for me, later, if she's especially good." She looked over at Sandy, "Lube?" 

 "Bedstand," she answered. 

 Sheri walked over to the side of the bed, opened a drawer, and pulled out one of the biggest bottles of lube I'd ever seen. It was clear and half-empty. She popped the top, and in a few moments had her 'cock' lubed up. She climbed on the bed behind her cousin. 

 "My turn." 

 Sandy lifted up and off my cock, then moaned as Sheri sank the dildo inside of her. She pounded at her cousin for a couple of minutes, then pulled out and guided my cock back inside. We took turns, only a minute or two each, and I honestly felt like I could fuck like that forever. 

 "She's getting close again," Sheri said. 

 I hadn't noticed the signs, but a few seconds later Sandy was moaning sweetly, grunting on each stroke. I watched Sheri lean over for some more lube. "Let's get this other hole ready. The little slut's begging for it." 

 Sandy gasped, and I felt her orgasm take over, while I stroked away inside of her. She groaned, and looked backward. "I don't know, Sheri. That's pretty big for back there." 

 "You'll love it. I'll be gentle." 

 Sandy looked at me nervously, biting her lip. "Should I stop her?" I asked. 

 She shook her head. "I...I'll be Ok. A little scary. Nothing that big back there before." 

 Her eyebrows pinched in pain, and she hissed. "Slowly!" 

 I stopped my movement, letting her get used to the new intruder. She lowered her head to my chest, with a moan. "Jesus, that's huge." 

 I could see Sheri now, moving back and forth slowly. "I'm going in," she warned. 

 "Fuuuuuck," Sandy groaned. 

 "All of it, baby. I knew you could do it." 

 "Wait," she gasped. "Let me get used to it." 

 I felt myself hardening inside of her. I couldn't believe how exciting it was. This was something totally new to me. Hell, anything with the two of them was new to me. I guess I'd led a sheltered life. 

 "Ok," Sandy breathed. "Easy now." 

 I started moving again, pushing up into her pussy, and I could feel the pressure from above, each time that rubber cock entered her ass. The feeling was intense. I pushed all the way in, letting Sheri do the work, and it was like someone was masturbating me inside of her pussy, rubbing the bottom of my cock from bottom to top and back again. 

 Sandy was looking into my face, and she smiled. "What's it like?" 

 "Wild. I can feel it move inside you, rubbing against me." I leaned forward and kissed her lips. "You like it?" 

 She nodded. "I love it. Once I got used to it. So fucking full. It's amazing. You feel huge, with her inside me." 

 She kissed me again. "Fuck me, Steve. Own me." 

 I started moving again, and Sheri was pounding away, hard. Sandy's head was beside mine. "Shit, she's going to make me come," she gasped. 

 I grabbed her hips, driving into her as hard as I could from that position, and I felt Sandy's fingers digging into my shoulders. 

 "You've almost got her," I told Sheri. 

 "I know. This is wild," she answered, breathing hard. 

 I put my lips to Sandy's ear. "Come for us, beautiful. Bring us together." 

 She whimpered, and started grunting rapidly. "Fuck, fuck, fuck," she gasped, and then I was hanging on for dear life, as she screamed out, "FUCK!" 

 Sheri was laughing, smacking her ass. "That's it. Come on my cock, you silly little whore." 

 It was all too much for me, and I didn't realize how close I was. I slammed my cock inside her, feeling the beginning of my own release. I squirted, backed out, and drove in again, emptying my balls inside of her silky warmth. 

 "Yeah!" I growled into her ear, and I felt her trembling, her orgasm rolling over her in waves. 

 She collapsed on me, and a few moments later, Sheri was lying beside us. "You don't think you're done, do you, my sexy little toy?" she asked, running her fingers through Sandy's disheveled hair. 

 "Too much," Sandy gasped. "Please, a break at least." 

 Sheri giggled, got up and returned with a chocolate covered strawberry, holding it to Sandy's lips. "You were wonderful. Here, for energy." 

 Sandy smiled and took a bite from it, juices dripping down on my chest. She lowered her mouth and licked it up clean, while the rest of the strawberry was offered to me. I took a bite, all but the stem, and felt a few drops dribble down my chin. Sheri leaned over and licked it up. "God, that was fun. This is going to be amazing, isn't it?" 

 Sandy laughed. "Easy for you to say. Wait until you're the cream in the cookie." 

 "Was it really that good?" Sheri asked. 

 "Unbelievable. Like a whole night of sex, wrapped up in just a few minutes. Wiped me out." 

 "Really? Or can we play a little longer?" 

 Sandy rolled off of me stretching. "You're going to have to kick me out. This is too good to leave willingly." 

 Sheri crawled across me, her naked little body lying on mine, and she kissed her cousin. "I'll never kick you out. Never." 

 Sandy gave her a hug. "I know. I love you too." 

 Sheri sat up grinning. "You made a mess. I expect you to clean it up." She grabbed Sandy's hair and started tugging her toward my waist. 

 Sandy whimpered a little, then her mouth settled in sucking and licking me clean. Sheri got off the bed, and headed for the bathroom. "A little sanitation for our other cock. I expect him fresh as new when you're done, or I'm going to take it out on that sexy ass of yours." 

 Sandy got me clean, and well on my way to another play session before Sheri returned, her strap-on in hand. "All better, but I think we can put this away for a while." 

 She climbed on the bed, inspecting the job. "Not bad, I guess your ass is safe for a bit." 

 Sandy rolled over onto her back, and opened her legs. "The cleaning's not done. I'm still messy. Help me out, gorgeous." 

 Sheri knelt between her legs, looking down. "I...it's not too bad," she said softly. 

 "Same man, different lips," Sandy whispered. "Love me?" 

 Sheri stretched out, her fingers moving slowly. "Gentle, Ok?" 

 "I won't move a muscle," Sandy said. "Please, I need it." 

 Sheri moved in, and I watched her face get closer. Her tongue reached out and brushed along the side of Sandy's pussy. Our guest gave a little moan, and I could no longer see the contact as Sheri's face settled in. 

 "So good," Sandy whispered. "You're always so good, Sher." 

 Sheri spent a couple of minutes between Sandy's legs, then Sandy was pulling her up her body, kissing her, hugging her tightly. "That was perfect. Thank you." 

 Sheri smiled. "It was good. I could taste him and you." 

 "Not too bad?" Sandy asked, nervously. 

 "No. Not at all. I...I liked it. A lot." 

 "Enough to do it some more?" 

 Sheri didn't even answer. She went back down and had Sandy moaning in minutes. Sheri lifted her head, grinning. "Naughty girl, you did that on purpose, didn't you?" 

 "A little extra taste. Want me to squeeze out some more?" 

 Sheri giggled. "I'm going to get it myself." 

 She dove back in, her head moving from side to side, while Sandy moaned sweetly. "Get it," she gasped. Her hands reached down, grabbing Sheri's head, and grinding against her mouth. I saw her body shaking in a small orgasm. 

 She relaxed, and jerked her hands back. "Sorry," she whimpered. 

 Sheri sat up, and her mouth and chin were a wet mess. "Don't be. That was perfect. I love when you come for me." 

 I never did get in Sheri that night, although the girls gave me a wonderful dual blow-job, and Sandy got a nice sweet missionary fuck that Sheri cleaned up afterward. Off of both of us. 

 Sandy called her husband, letting him know she was going to spend the night, and giving him a little update, promising the full blow-by-blow later. I was amazed at how casually she discussed what she did, and the look of joy and love in her eyes as she chatted with her fiancée. Sheri and I layed down beside her and started fondling her, making her beautiful body writhe. "God, Robbie, they're touching me, touching me all over." 

 We only played with her gently, and I suckled on her nipple teasingly, while she spoke on the phone. When she was done, she pulled me up for a kiss. "You two are so naughty. Teasing me like that." 

 The nervous Nellies insisted on checking my bandages before calling it a night. Apparently none the worse for wear, but still getting me a nice dose of sympathy. 

 I slept between the two beauties, wondering what I'd ever done to deserve this new life of mine. 

 * * * 

 I woke in pain, with the booze and pain-killers worn off. My back was in agony, and I felt sore in places I didn't even know I had. The girls took care of me, even giving me a massage, and fixing my bandages which had worked themselves loose during the night. We didn't have any sex that morning, but we did have lots of cuddling and loving, and that was fine by me. 

 Room service delivered breakfast, and when it was done, Sandy begged off. She gave us both toe curling kisses. "Tomorrow night?" she asked. 

 "Open door," Sheri told her. "Anytime. Right, handsome?" 

 "I'm not going to complain." 

 Sheri giggled. "I bet not. You have fun last night?" 

 "Best ever. I can only wonder if my heart can take it, when I get all of you," I told her. 

 "Soon baby. Don't worry, I know CPR." 

 * * * 

 We spent a relaxing day, going for a walk in the park, exploring the hotel and immediate environs, chatting on the phone with friends. We stopped by her house, and reassured her parents that she was doing fine. We stayed for an early dinner, and spent some time playing with Max. She showed me her room, which I'd only seen a little of over Skype. 

 "So this is where the magic happens," I teased. 

 She laughed. "Where I lost my heart to the most wonderful man in the world."  

 

 

===

"Who is it? I'll kill the bastard," I growled, taking her in my arms and swinging her around. 

 She kissed me, blushing. "Do you really love me?" she asked. 

 "More than words can say. With all my heart, Angel." 

 "Devil," she reminded me. 

 "Only in the bed," I told her. "Speaking of, you really are a pretty wild thing, aren't you?" 

 She giggled, walking around me, her hand dragging across my skin. "Only for you, lover." 

 "And Sandy," I teased. 

 "Alright, only for the ones I love. You're first now, you understand? Think you can handle that?" 

 "Patience. That's all I ask. I had no idea what I was getting myself into." 

 She giggled, her arms around my neck. "All I ask is the same. You've been so patient with me all this time, in game and out. Think you can put up with me a little longer?" 

 "I don't know," I teased. "I guess I'll give you another 70, 80 years. But that's all. If you don't come around by then, I'm gonna start looking." 

 She stepped on my toes. "You do, and I'll take my toys and go play somewhere else. Including Sandy." 

 "Alright, damn it. Ninety. Ninety years, that's my final offer." 

 She hugged me. "No. Forever or nothing." 

 I picked her up, hugging her tight. "Fine. But I get to choose which side of the bed is mine." 

 "Of course! It's always the other side next to me." 

 "Damn it, girl. Leave me some pride. Do I get to at least name our kids?" 

 She looked up at me, her eyes wide. "Do...do you really want to have children with me?" 

 "If at all possible. A house full." 

 "Really?" she asked nervously. 

 I drew her over to the chair, and sat her on my lap. "Of course. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Raise a family together. Is something wrong?" 

 "I, I don't know if I can have kids. There was some concern after it happened." She looked on the verge of tears. 

 I hugged her. "Whatever we can do. If you can, great. If you can't and there's anything medical that can be done, we can afford it. If you can't carry, but your eggs are good, we can have a surrogate. If not, we can adopt. Whatever. Even if we can't have kids, you're mine, Sheri, no matter what." 

 She nodded, hugging me. "I haven't thought about it much. I don't know why. I guess it never occurred to me I'd ever be with a man again. Be part of a real, normal family. Not for real." 

 "No hurry. You're young. One step at a time, Ok?" 

 "One step at a time," she answered softly. 

 Sheri gave me a hug, and looked up grinning. "Middle name." 

 "What?" 

 "The middle name of our third child. You can choose that name." 

 "Are you always so rotten?" 

 "Absolutely. Completely spoiled. Not my fault. You're going to have to get used to it. Blame Dad if you must." 

 We returned to the hotel late, and retired to the bedroom. No gaming at all for once. We got in bed together, and our kissing and cuddling evolved into a wonderful evening of oral sex. She was cautious, and nervous, but by midway through my second erection, she was playful and teasing. She gave me a hard time about my own skills, telling me that she'd have to get Sandy to give me lessons. I guess she saw that hurt a little, and she swarmed over me, begging forgiveness, and telling me she was teasing. 

 "No you're not, I saw what Sandy does to you," I told her. 

 She blushed. "She knows me. She's been with me for years. It's different. I love what you do for me, I swear. Don't be angry or jealous, please! It would kill me. I'm sorry, I was just teasing." 

 "I'm not angry. Maybe a little jealous. Not of her, but of what she has with you. How well she knows you." 

 She kissed me softly. "I know. Believe me. You don't think I'm not a little jealous over your posse? Your complete and total faith and trust in them? The way they hovered over you? Even their damn women are in love with you. They've had you all their lives. How do I compete with that?" 

 I gave her a squeeze. "No competition. I love them. I'm in love with you. You are number one in my life." 

 She nodded. "Ditto. I love Sandy. I probably always will. She and I are wonderful together. But my heart is yours. Totally. What I feel for her is a faint echo of my love for you. We have everything but the sex, and by the time I'm done with you, we'll be magical together. I know it." 

 She kissed me long and deep. "I love you. You love me," she whispered. "Truce on our others?" 

 "Truce. Hell, what am I saying? It's not truce, I accept her in your life without limits. Whatever you want, Ok? But no way I'm bringing Jaime into our bed." 

 She laughed. "Spoil sport. Did you see the size of his hands? Do you think it's true..." 

 "Rotten girl. I'm telling you, Maria would eat you alive, and spit out the bones." 

 She sighed dramatically. "Alright. This bed's too small for four anyway, and Sandy would kill me if I brought in any boy-toys and she wasn't invited." 

 She sat up and straddled me, leaning down and kissing my nose. "You know I'm teasing, right? I don't want any man but you. Ever. The only man I'd even think of inviting into our bed would be Robert, and that would be for Sandy. So he could see me and her together. I know that turns him on something crazy. I'd never let him have me. I'm yours, bub. Only yours. Get used to it." 

 "Good. 'Cause I'm yours, too. Nobody else." 

 "Except Sandy," she reminded me. 

 "No. She's yours. Not mine. You want her with us, I'm happy to do it for you. But that's it." 

 She giggled. "I know you like her. You can't fool me." 

 "I think she's great. I love her, like I love my own. For what she's done for you, and how she is with you. She's a beautiful, wonderful woman with a heart of gold. Sexy as hell. Wild in bed. As God is my witness, as long as I have you, she's an afterthought." 

 "She grows on you," Sheri teased. 

 I laughed. "What do you want from me? I love her, and love being with her. I'll never kick her out of our bed. But, damn it Sheri, I'd be happy with only you beside me for the rest of my life." 

 She wiggled on me, kissing my face. "You haven't even had her ass yet. She's a wild fuck. You can tie her up and use her hard." 

 "Evil. You know you're absolutely evil. She's our toy. I get it. You're the love of my life. Keep it up, and I'll be tanning that cute little bottom of yours." 

 "Mmm, she pinks up so nicely. You can get her to come just by paddling her." 

 "Sheri..." 

 She laughed, hugging me. "God, you're so easy to tease. She's going to be married in a few months anyway. I don't think Robert will let her play nearly as much after. So you best get your fill. In a while you're going to be stuck with just me." 

 "That's all I could ever ask for." 

 She cuddled up to me, kissing my chest. "You know what's funny, Steve?" 

 "What?" I asked sleepily. 

 "I believe you. Jeez, I'm going to have you so whipped. Worse than Jaime." 

 I chuckled, and swatted her rear. "Tell me about it." 

 * * * 

 I had a morning checkup at the hospital, and was given a passing grade, and reminded not to overdo it. Sheri and I took a long walk in the park, walking hand in hand like the new lovers we were, even if we weren't quite completely lovers. 

 Dan stopped by after lunch, and Sheri made herself scarce for a couple of hours while we did the work thing, including a conference call with the others. Too early to know much about our latest venture, but he was getting antsy and wanted me to get going and start researching new opportunities. He'd never been that pushy. I wondered if it was an effort to get me out of the game, and back in the real world. 

 I told him I needed a few more days, and within the week I'd start looking around, reviewing some of the proposals we'd been receiving, and start the networking up again. He seemed alright with that. 

 "No gaming yesterday?" he noted. 

 "No, a few hours this afternoon maybe." 

 "You and Sheri good?" he asked. 

 "Perfect. Or almost. We're working out some things. I think this time it's for good. Third time's a charm, and all that." 

 Jaime cut in. "Maria says if you let this one go, she's going to kick both our asses. You know how I hate when she does that." 

 I laughed. "Yeah. I imagine there'd be a line she'd have to get in when it came to kicking mine." 

 Dan jumped in. "No shit. I call first dibs. Make me go through that beating for nothing. Hell, I'd get back in line twice. Steel-toed boots." 

 "Alright, tell me how you really feel," I laughed. 

 "Ok, I will," Dan said. "Jump on that now. Claim her, and don't let anyone else even get their nose in the door. You're so hung up over her, if you lose her, it'll be 10 years of gaming before we ever get you out in public again. And the way she is over you? Fuck, dude, no way you're ever going to top that. I get to be best man, by the way." 

 The other guys all started yelling. "Asshole!" "Douche-bag, we talked about that!" 

 That was the end of the useful part of our meeting, and we got back to talking about important things, like soloing Diablo hardcore, and the new WoW expansion pack. 

 Dan left when the others bowed out, but invited himself over for dinner. Said he had some business to attend to. I told Sheri about the plans when she came home, during a little hardcore farming. She let me know that she'd already made plans with Sandy and Robert that we'd meet with them again. That spurred a short conversation about letting each other know what was going on, and ended in a cuddle-fest. I suggested Peter Luger's, craving their porterhouse. We went to Lombardi's, the renovated home of New York's first pizza. Truth be told, I liked several of the simple walk up pizzeria's better, blasphemy or not. 

 I was feeling a little nervous about seeing Robert, but he was the same charming bastard. When the girls took off for the ladies room, he leaned over to me. "It's cool. Really. I don't want you to feel weird about this. Whatever she needs right now. We're good?" 

 Kind of surprised he'd even ask. "That woman of yours is the best, you know. Damn, you're a lucky man. Heart of gold, easy to see why Sheri loves her so much." 

 He laughed. "Ditto. Breaks my heart what Sheri went through. Believe me, I've heard endless hours of what she was before, what she went through, and how she was after. I was starting to think I'd never actually get to meet her in person. What you did for her, you deserve a fucking medal. I've never seen Sandy so happy. That makes me happy. I know you don't have a thing for her, it's obvious when they're both around. When Sheri's around, the rest of us are practically invisible. Makes it easy." 

 Dan spoke up. "Alright, if the love-fest is over with, you guys want to tell me what the hell is going on?" 

 I laughed. "Shut the fuck up, Dan. This has nothing to do with you, alright?" 

 He put on a mask of disappointment. "Hey! I fought for her too!" 

 Robert and I looked at each other and laughed. "That you did," I told him. "You're golden in her book. Now leave it." 

 I turned back to Robert. "You could help me with something. We're still looking for some good investments. Tech and Energy companies preferably. Maybe Medical. We prefer second round venture buy ins, not seed money. Don't need the risk/ reward that entails. You catch wind of anything worthwhile, I'd love to hear about it. I could even use a good legal team to work with, if you know of one." I gave him a grin. 

 "Robertson, Samuels not working for you? They're good." 

 "I'd prefer something local. I'm thinking of sticking around here. Making it home base. Plus I'd prefer working with someone I actually liked." 

 "Damn, that narrows it down, doesn't it? Rumor is you can't stand lawyers," he said with a chuckle. 

 "Almost always true. I think I'm learning to make some exceptions." 

 "I'll keep my eye open. Finder's fee?" 

 "For the right opportunity." 

 "What kind of numbers we talking?" 

 "Between 10 and 40 preferably. We could go higher for the right deal." 

 Sandy leaned over and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "What kind of deals are you boys working out? Nothing illegal or immoral I hope." 

 He grinned, while Sheri settled in between me and Dan. "Maybe a little bit of both. You remember I am a lawyer, right?" 

 "Oh, business? I was thinking something more along personal lines," she said. "How droll. Talking about business, with two lovely ladies present." 

 He laughed. "They weren't present, and the subject is benched. What would you lovely ladies like to talk about?" 

 "Vacations. Cruise, all-inclusive, something lazy and decadent, with lots of down-time." 

 I glance over at Sheri, who was trying to look innocent. 

 "Vacation?" Robert chuckled. "You've got a honeymoon in less than three months." 

 "That's a wonderful start!" she said. "I'm thinking summer, sunbathing, and as little clothing as possible." 

 It was a fun chat, and had me thinking about whether Sheri and I would be married by then. I wondered how much time she's need for a wedding. Damn, she was right. I was pussy-whipped already, and hadn't even gotten any of the pussy. 

 We split up after dinner, Dan and Robert going their own ways, and Sandy going home with us. She was laughing. "You guys have to be gentle with me. I'm serious. I'm so sore now I can barely walk. Between you two the other night, and then how Robert was when I gave him all the details, I haven't been pounded like that, since, hell, since ever!" 

 She stopped, and grabbed Sheri by the hands. "Please? I'm serious. A little gentle, tonight?" 

 Sheri hugged her. "I think I'd like to make tonight about me. I'm going to need your help." 

 Sandy hugged her, "It'll be perfect. It will. I know it. This is going to be ab-fab." 

 I was seriously wondering what it cost to live like I was full-time. Doors opened. The elevator man knowing us, taking us straight to our floor. Limo service for the asking. The room immaculate. Anything we needed a phone call away. We were living large, and it was something I could get used to. 

 I'd been thinking hard about the Sheri problem. I had an idea, that I thought we might fall back on if necessary. I wanted to see if we could make things work naturally first. I took Sandy to the side and told her my thoughts, and she seemed to like it. As a fall-back solution. 

 We went to our bedroom, and got undressed. It was so natural, to watch both girls strip down to nothing, and climb into my bed. Fucking amazing bodies, one small and curvy, the other long and slender. Both sexy as hell. Shit, I was a lucky guy. 

 We started out with the cuddling and kissing, this time with Sheri in the middle. We moved on to some sensual touching and I grinned as I shared her tits with Sandy, lifting my head for a kiss from her, before we went back after Sheri's perky little nipples. Sandy leaned over and playfully competed for a nipple, our tongues tangling. She lifted her eyes to mine, and the joy and happiness I saw there was heart-warming. "You're the best," I whispered. 

 She looked a little surprised, then grabbed my head and kissed me hard. "God, you're so damn lovable," she sighed. 

 We both went down on Sheri, and I demanded Sandy teach me some of her magic. She laughed, kissing me again. "You're not jealous of me, are you?" 

 "Damn skippy I am! And you're going to share your secrets, or any promises made about being gentle with you are out the door. I will tie you up and fuck the living daylights out of you if you don't share." 

 She giggled. "That's a threat?" 

 I shrugged. "Best I can come up with at the moment. I am in bed with two gorgeous naked women. My brain is only capable of so many thoughts right now." 

 "How about this? I teach you all I know about her, and next time we're together, you do exactly what you said, and then some." 

 "You've got a deal." 

 "Good. First thing, get out of this bed, go in the bathroom and give yourself the closest shave possible, then use her skin lotion. Your face is like sandpaper." She gave me a quick peck on the lips. "Take your time, I'll only warm her up a little." 

 Back in the bed, she made me open my mouth, and popped in a wintergreen lifesaver. "Now this is cheating a little," she teased, giving me a little kiss on the lips. "Mmmm, fresh. She'll notice. Not as much as those Altoids, but still a little advantage." 

 The rest was an education. I learned. I was taught little things, like indirect stimulation, inner vs. outer lips, fingering essentials, top and bottom, variety, pressure, teasing, blowing, sucking, licking. They were both getting into my training, and I had to take a turn on each of them, with the other giving me added guidance. I was worn out by the time I'd given them each two 'adequate' orgasms. Then they teased me by giving each other one, showing me what it could be like with practice and a little more tutelage. 

 Fuck. I had a ton of ground to makeup. They played each other like maestros. They must have read my mind, and mobbed me, hugs and kisses galore. "It's not a competition baby," Sandy teased. "You're wonderful, and there's things that you can do that leave us completely out." 

 Sheri nodded. "Your strength, for one. Feeling your big hands holding me so firmly. The direct way you attack. All good." 

 I was rewarded for my efforts by another dual blow-job. I really could get used to those. The visuals alone were mind-blowing. Sandy had nothing but praise for the progress that Sheri had made in only one evening. I delivered my praise physically, filling Sandy's mouth, with a little taste for Sheri at the end. 

 Afterward, Sheri sat on my face, while Sandy put her talented mouth back to work, getting me ready for phase two. I put my newly learned skills to practice, warming up Sheri. 

 When I was hard as steel, and I had Sheri moaning sweetly, Sandy decided it was time to put her to the test. I remained on my back, and Sheri nervously straddled me. She looked over at Sandy, "Patience, Ok?" 

 Sandy gave her a hug. "I'm an observer. I won't even get involved. You'll be fine." 

 She wasn't. I didn't understand it, everything else was going to well, but I felt bad for her. I knew she wanted to, but as she pressed the head of my cock against her opening she started shaking, and I saw the tears in her eyes. I put my hands on her thighs, gently, for support, and she practically jumped off of me. 

 She sat quietly, curled up in a ball. "I'm sorry. I know I can do this." She looked up at me. "I love you. I do. I swear to God I do." 

 I didn't reach for her, worried that I might upset her some way. "I know, baby. There's no hurry. Whatever you are Ok with." 

 She sniffled. "What if I'm never Ok?" she whimpered. "What if I'm broken?" 

 Sandy went to her, hugging and rocking her. "No, you're not broken. Look at how far you've come. That blow-job was amazing. We can do this. I know it. If not tonight, soon. Nobody's giving up here!" 

 Sheri nodded. "How about we try with me on the bottom?" 

 "You want to try again? Now?" Sandy asked. 

 She wiped her eyes and nodded. 

 Sandy fluffed the pillows, and laid my gamer girl back on the bed. We took a couple of minutes pampering and cuddling her, then Sandy moved between her legs. A couple of minutes later Sheri was obviously excited, and I took Sandy's place. I rubbed my cock up and down Sheri's slit, parting her lips, and she jerked back away from me for a second, then settled down. 

 "You Ok?" I asked. 

 "Go ahead," she whispered anxiously. 

 I pressed my cockhead into her opening, and felt her trembling. I was tempted to stop, and let her settle down, but thought maybe once I was in, she'd get over the worst of it. I pressed into her, feeling her tight opening give, watching the first couple of inches slide in. 

 "Stop," Sandy said, her hand pushing me away gently. 

 I looked up, and saw the tears rolling down Sheri's face, her eyes clenched shut, teeth gritted. 

 I pulled out, and climbed up the bed. Sheri's legs snapped shut behind me. "I can do this," she whispered. "I can."  

 

 

===

I held her in my arms, while Sandy soothed her. "No, you're forcing it, baby. It has to be good. You need to be ready. Accept him. Welcome him inside you. Not suffer through it." 

 Sheri sobbed. "Why?" she moaned. 

 God, it hurt to hear her. So much pain, so much unsaid, with that simple heart- rending cry. 

 "Hush," Sandy whispered. "We'll get through this. I promise, Ok? Me, Sheri. I promise. You know I'll never let you down. We're all in this together. You love each other like nobody's business. It's going to be alright. Better than alright." 

 She gave Sheri a long soft kiss. "I'm going to let him fuck me a while. We're torturing him. I want you to relax, and when you feel like it, you can watch." 

 Sandy pushed me on my back, and straddled me. She gave me a grin. "Plan B." 

 Plan B was simple enough. We knew Sheri was a very visual person, a bit of an exhibitionist and voyeur. We'd play to that part of her. 

 I nodded, and closed my eyes as she lowered herself onto my cock. She rode me gently, rocking back and forth easily. Sheri rolled onto her side, her head on my shoulder. "It looks so easy. Why am I having so much trouble? I want this so bad, Steve. For us." 

 I gave her a little kiss. "Maybe that's part of it. You want it too much. It's too important to you. Relax. Enjoy what we have. Play along if you want, but only what you really want to do." 

 She nodded. "It doesn't hurt, does it?" 

 Sandy answered. "No, sugar. Just the opposite. It doesn't hurt at all, unless I take him too deep at the beginning. I need to get used to it a little, because he does reach the back and that can be a bit uncomfortable." She giggled. "Luckily, our little pussies seem to adapt. When you two were pounding all the way in last night, it was amazing. No pain or discomfort at all. It just takes a little time." 

 She rose up on her feet, and squatted over my cock, lifting and lowering herself, giving us the most incredible view. "He's the perfect size, you know. Thick enough to feel great, without feeling all stretched out. Long enough to reach the deepest parts without poking a hole in the back. Fucking perfect cock," she gasped, thrusting down hard several times. 

 She dropped back on her knees. "Get behind me. See what it's like from there. You can see everything. I wouldn't mind if you played with my bottom a little, just nothing crazy, Ok? It's really tender." 

 Sheri moved behind her, and Sandy winked at me, blowing me a kiss. "Sexy, huh?" she asked. 

 "God, Sandy, he looks like he's stretching you so wide," Sheri answered. 

 Sandy lifted her hips, giving me some room to work, and I thrust up into her, longer full strokes. 

 "Mmm, that feels great," Sandy purred. 

 "All of it fits?" 

 "C'mon Sheri! He's no bigger than Buster. You know that fits pretty damn well. Both of us." 

 "He's thicker." 

 "A little. A wonderful, precious little. I love that extra little." 

 I felt Sheri's hand on my cock, just below Sandy's entrance. Her fingers sliding against my shaft as I pushed upward. "He's so hard." 

 "Yeah. Isn't that great? He gets like that for us. Hard like a rock." 

 I gave her longer strokes, until she shifted, purposely letting me fall out. 

 "Oh, put it back in baby, I'm so empty! Put him back in me," Sandy whined. 

 I felt Sheri's hand guide me back home, and I hammered at Sandy hard. 

 "That doesn't hurt? Hard like that?" Sheri whispered. 

 "Fuck no," Sandy gasped. "Perfect." 

 I pulled back extra far, popping loose, and Sheri guided me back in without prompting. 

 "Oh yeah," Sandy murmured. "That's great, when he sticks it back in. Feeling him open me up. Stretching me." 

 I started trying to think of other things, distractions, not wanting to get too worked up yet. Not yet. 

 Sandy wiggled herself free of my cock, and held herself up too high for insertion. "Taste me on him," she said. "Suck my juices off his cock." 

 Sheri's mouth engulfed me, sucking sweetly. I felt her moving up and down. "God, that's naughty," she said giggling. 

 Sandy laughed, "I know, right? Put it back now, I'm not done with him." 

 She lowered her hips and Sheri guided me home for another minute of fucking before Sandy pulled off. "Taste me, baby." She giggled a second later. "No, off of him, silly." 

 I felt Sheri's warm mouth again, and Sandy smiled at me. "Time," she whispered softly, her face inches from mine. 

 She climbed off of me, while Sheri, sucked me, watching her friend. Sandy knelt next to her. "I've got an idea, want to try it?" 

 Sheri pulled free. "What kind of idea?" 

 "Naughty. Those are the best kinds. Keep him hard for me, I'll be right back." 

 She left us, and Sheri looked at me. "You two are up to something, aren't you?" 

 I gave her my most innocent look. "Me? She's the wild one. No, let me correct that. You're the wild one, but she's no Angel either." 

 Sheri grinned, and gave me a quick suck. "Nothing bad, right?" 

 "Of course not. Speak of the devil..." 

 Sandy had a video camera and tablet in her hand. "Come here honey, we're going to try something. You and me, hands and knees, side by side, Ok?" 

 Sheri looked nervous, but let her best friend guide her into position. "Hips nice and high," Sandy told her. 

 It was an amazing view. Those two asses lifted up in welcome for me. God, I hoped this worked. 

 Sandy held the tablet between them. "Now watch him fuck me," she said. 

 I held the camera up below my chin, and guided my cock into Sandy. She purred sweetly as my length slipped into her. "Pretty amazing isn't it?" 

 "He slips right in, doesn't he?" Sheri chuckled. 

 "Oh yeah. God, it feels good. Way better than that cold rubber. He feels hot inside of me. Hot and hard." 

 I gave her long slow strokes, while listening. 

 "Mmm. So good, Sheri. I want you to feel this. It's so damned good. Try it for me?" 

 Sheri, tensed up a little. "Now, like this?" 

 "Yes. Watch the video with me. Don't think about it. Just feel his cock against you. Not even inside you, just against you. Can we do that?" 

 She was quiet. "Against me. Just the opening, right?" 

 "Yeah. Only the opening. Can we?" 

 She nodded. I backed away from Sandy who moved her leg, giving me some room. I straddled Sheri's legs, avoiding touching her at all. I aimed my cock at her opening, with the camera capturing the close-up view. 

 "Look at that," Sandy said. "Hard and waiting. Watch it. Watch him." 

 I moved forward, my cock slowly coming in contact with her. She flinched for a moment, then held still while I slid the head up and down across her lips. 

 "God, that looks so wild. Teasing, opening you up. One nudge and he'd be in you," Sandy whispered. "I'm so jealous. You have the prettiest pussy in the world. Sweetest too." 

 "Mmmhmmm," Sheri hummed nervously. 

 I moved up and down a couple more times, parting her lips. 

 "Look how wet you are, Sheri! You can see your juices on his cock." 

 I pushed forward a hair, watching the head of my cock slowly disappear, her lips parting, then slide back out. Again. And again. 

 "Wow. Did you see that? How you stretched around him? That didn't hurt did it?" 

 "No," she said, but I heard the quiver in her voice. Enough. I pulled back out and returned to Sandy. I teased her opening, just like I had with Sheri. 

 "Oh, that's so good," Sandy whispered. "Opening me, teasing me. God I love it." 

 I pushed the head in, then pulled it out a couple of times. 

 "More," she pleaded. "Don't tease me, let me feel it." 

 "It's just like in me," Sheri whispered. 

 "I know. Exactly the same. He's driving me crazy." 

 I slid inside her a couple of inches at a time, rocking back and forth getting a little deeper with each stroke, until I was all the way inside. "Look at that," Sandy said. "All of it. I'm taking all of that big fat cock." 

 I stroked her, holding her hips and going deep. After a few dozen strokes I pulled out and she whimpered softly. "Shit," she murmured. "Your turn, ready? Just the head again, Ok?" 

 "Ok," Sheri said. 

 I went back to her, opening her exactly the same way, until the head was nudging in. She was holding perfectly still, but she didn't jerk away this time. A few more nudges, and the head was out of view. I paused, leaning my chest back, and zooming in on our connection. 

 "He's in you. Look! Can you believe it? How does it feel?" Sandy asked. 

 "Good," Sheri whispered. "It looks so nasty. All that big cock trying to get inside." 

 "A little more?" 

 Sheri nodded. "A little, that's all." 

 I pulled out, and pressed back in a couple of times. On the third stroke, I continued pressing until about an inch was inside her. I stopped. 

 "God, he's fucking you," Sandy whispered. "Does it hurt?" 

 "No." 

 "Can I have him back?" she asked. 

 "Just a little more, Ok?" Sheri asked. 

 Music to my ears. I back out a bit, keeping the head inside her, then pushed forward just that inch. In and out, trying to think of gameplay, getting a little too worked up. I pushed a little extra, and saw another couple of inches enter her. Almost half my length. I pulled back and heard Sandy giggle. "Look at that. How your tight little pussy clings to him. It doesn't want to let go." 

 Sheri chuckled. "Naughty kitty. He said he was going to pet it." 

 "Very naughty. That's the extra thickness. Not bad, huh?" 

 "No, feels good," she whispered. 

 She whimpered when I pulled out of her, and went back to Sandy. 

 "Goody. My turn. You were hogging all the cock, rotten thing." 

 I slid into Sandy, going deep on the first stroke. Playing at her opening was too much for my sensitive head. Nice easy strokes inside her were better to keep me calm. 

 I looked down at the girls and watched Sheri nudge her friend with my shoulder. "I wasn't hogging. You had him a lot more than me, and he is my boyfriend." 

 "Let me have him just a little bit, sweetie? He feels so good in me." 

 "Just a little," Sheri whispered, her eyes watching the tablet where my cock was sliding into her friend. "Only because I love you so much." 

 "Oh," Sandy moaned, pushing back against me. "I love you too. Love you so much, baby." 

 Sheri watched a few more seconds. "My turn?" 

 "A little more?" Sandy whined. 

 "Who's hogging him now?" Sheri whispered. 

 "But he's yours forever," Sandy said. 

 "My turn!" 

 I pulled out of Sandy, wrenching another sweet whimper from her, then returned to Sheri. I held steady for a moment, letting the camera stabilize, then pushed into her. Just the head to start with, then with a series of slow gentle nudges I had half my length inside of her. 

 "Halfway," Sandy said. "More?" 

 "A little," Sheri said softly. 

 I pulled back and pressed forward, enough of me inside her to start stroking. Back and forth I went, inching more inside until there was only a little light between us. She felt amazing. Definitely tighter than Sandy. Almost too tight. 

 "God, girl. You're going to take all of it, aren't you?" Sandy said. 

 Sheri nodded. "All the way this time." 

 "You sure? That's a lot of cock. I can take it if you want," Sandy teased. 

 "My turn," Sheri whispered, and I felt her push back against me, until her ass cheeks pressed against my hips. 

 I couldn't help myself, and I let my free hand stray down to her back, caressing her. She flinched under my touch, then pulled forward and pressed back against me, hard. I felt the pressure inside her, where I bottomed out. She gasped, then started rocking back and forth on my cock. 

 Her eyes were locked on the tablet. "See. I can take all of it too. All of it." She pulled away, exposing all of my cock, then impaled herself, grunting sweetly. 

 "How is it?" Sandy asked. 

 "Fucking great," Sheri moaned sliding forward and driving back on my cock. "So fucking much better than Buster." 

 "My turn?" Sandy asked. 

 "God, Sandy! I just got him. Give me a little while, Ok?" She was looking down at the tablet. "Look at that, will you? He's not doing me, I'm doing him." 

 Sandy chuckled. "Of course. You always were the wild one." 

 Sheri giggled. "Is Robert like this?" 

 "Almost the same length. Not as thick. That thickness, Jesus, that feels sweet. You've got a keeper." 

 "I know, right?" she chuckled. "All that, and a nice fat cock too." 

 "My turn?" Sandy pleaded. "Please?" 

 "Fine. Meanie." 

 I moved the camera down, and captured the image of me pulling out of her, her pussy closing slowly after I pulled out. 

 "Wow," Sandy whispered. "You really didn't want to give him up. I thought I could see your tonsils there for a second." 

 "Oh, like you're any better?" She looked over her shoulder at me. "I want a good shot of her gaping for you afterward." 

 I laughed and drove my cock into Sandy, making her grunt. "Shit," she moaned. "I thought you guys were going to be gentle with me." 

 I grabbed her hips and pounded her for a while. "Opening you up, sweetness," I teased. 

 Sheri giggled. "Give it to her. Pound the greedy slut." 

 I did, fucking her hard, making her moan for me. I brought the camera down and pulled out quickly. Her opening was slow to close, a quarter sized black opening staying visible for a few seconds, before slowly shrinking away. I grabbed her ass and pulled her cheek to the side, her opening widening again, until I released her. 

 "See, slut? You're pussy's desperate for that big cock. Worse than mine," Sheri teased. 

 "He went easy on you," Sandy whined. "I couldn't help it, he banged the hell out of me." 

 I moved behind Sheri, pushing in slowly. 

 "Like her," Sheri said. 

 I grabbed her hip with my free hand, feeling a little tremble, then started fucking her harder. Long deep strokes. After only a few, I knew I was in trouble. 

 "I can't," I warned her. "If I fuck you like her, I'm going to come. I can't hold back when I'm inside you." 

 She looked over at her friend, smirking. She gave her hips a torturous wiggle. "Do it then. Fuck me hard and come for me." 

 I didn't hold back, pounding into her, and I heard her first little moan. It was driving me crazy. I would love to make her come on my cock, but there wasn't a chance in hell. I had to come. I was holding back on every stroke, but it was a lost cause. 

 "Fuck," I groaned, slamming my cock into her with long full strokes. I looked down and saw her head resting on the pillow, her eyes closed, the tablet abandoned. 

 I drove myself in to the hilt, and let go, flooding her insides. She groaned, and I gave a series of short strokes, pumping out all I could. Sandy sat up and took the camera from me, moving back and capturing a picture of the both of us. 

 "Damn, you two are hot," she chuckled. 

 I slid my hands down Sheri's back, all the way to her shoulders. I held her and drove my hips against her, trying to get just a little deeper. I leaned down and kissed her shoulder. "I love you so much," I told her. 

 She arched her back, pushing against me. "Mmmm, I can tell." 

 I pulled out of her, and laid down next to her. "Damn that was incredible," I told her. 

 She laid on her side, looking at me. "The both of us? Every man's fantasy?" 

 "The finish," I answered. "Coming inside you. Amazing." 

 She smacked me jokingly. "Bullshit. Come on. Two hotties? Taking turns on them? That had to be epic." 

 I lost track of my answer when Sandy's mouth slid over my cock. "I'm not going to lie. That was pretty amazing. But getting to fuck the love of my life for the first time? Unbelievable." 

 "Am I? The love of your life?" 

 "Stop fishing for compliments, rotten thing." 

 She giggled, rolling over onto her back, and opening her legs. "You know you love me. Don't be afraid to say it." 

 I eased my arm under her head, and she wiggled onto my shoulder. "I LOVE THIS GIRL!" I shouted. "Happy? We're probably going to get complaints." 

 "If we didn't get complaints from our little screamer two night ago, nobody's going to whine about a little love shout." 

 Sandy abandoned my cock, and shifted over between Sheri's legs. 

 "Mmmm. See why I want to keep her? Isn't she the best?" 

 "Best friend ever. Better than we deserve." 

 "No shit. But I can make her come really good. That should be worth something." 

 Sandy poked her head up. "Nice cock, too. You keep me around, you don't get to hog all the cock now, bitch." 

 Sheri laughed, grabbing her friend's head, and pushing it back between her legs. "Don't worry, slut slave. You'll be getting plenty of cock. I'd never make you do without. You know that." 

 I scooted closer, and kissed Sheri softly. She smiled, her eyes glistening. "We did it, didn't we?" 

 I chuckled. "Oh yeah. We definitely did it. You're alright?" 

 She nodded. "Better than alright. I was getting into it there, at the end. The start was a little scary. But the little bitch was making me so jealous, watching you in her, when you should be in me." 

 Sandy climbed up from where she'd been, taking the other side of Sheri. "You always amaze me, girl. Always. Can you believe where we are now? Compared to just a few months ago?" 

 "It's him, you know. It couldn't be anyone but him." 

 "No shit. If anyone should be jealous, it's me. He's stealing my baby, and you get the jackpot." 

 "You have Robert," Sheri whispered, pulling Sandy's lips down for a kiss. 

 Sandy grinned. "Yeah, I do. Wouldn't trade that one for anything. Not even your White Knight. God, I love that man." 

 Sheri giggled. "We're both pretty lucky, aren't we?" 

 "Hit the boyfriend Lotto. Home-run. Luckiest girls in the city." 

 I laughed. "Enough, you silly girls. Robert and I both know the truth. We're the lucky ones. You two could have your choice of any man in the state. No way we're deserving." 

 Sandy surprised me by climbing on top of me, straddling my hips and pushing my shoulders down roughly. "You shut the fuck up! Don't you EVER say you don't deserve us. NEVER!" 

 I was stunned by her reaction. She dropped down and hugged me, squeezing so tightly I thought she'd tear my stitches. "Don't, Ok? I can't stand it. You don't know. You have no idea what it was like. How much you've done. So don't ever, ever say you don't deserve us." 

 I held her, stroking her back softly. Kissing the side of her pretty face. "Shhh," I whispered, as she cried into my shoulder. "Don't cry, please. You're breaking my heart, Angel." 

 Sheri had snuggled in closer, and her hand was caressing her best friend, soothingly. 

 "You don't know," Sandy sobbed. "You weren't there. You brought her back. I didn't think we'd ever get her back. Two fucking years I tried everything. God, I love her so much, and there was nothing I could do, nothing any of us could do." She lifted her head and held my face in her hands. "You did it. Impossible, but you didn't care, you did it anyway. Even tonight, you knew. You just knew. I...I love you for that. Fuck, I don't mind saying it. I love you." 

 I caressed her soft skin, kissing her lips softly. "I love you too. I've told her." I glanced over to where Sheri was watching us, inches away, and saw her eyes shining. "What you've done for her, what you are to her. Even now, how you're fighting for us. You're the best, Sandy. Absolute best woman I've ever known. I love you to death." 

 She sniffled, smiling. "No, I'm not. I'm not even a very nice person. I'm selfish, and rude, and mean." 

 I smacked her bare bottom. "Don't. I know your heart. Nobody who can love like you is selfish." I kissed her again, more passionately, feeling the response below my waist. "I need to be in you now," I whispered. 

 She smiled, and reached between us, guiding me home. She pushed back against me, until I was completely seated. "I guess you do like me a little, don't you?" 

 I laughed, and turned to Sheri. "You're right. She does grow on you." 

 Sandy gave a wiggle of her hips, and giggled. "And you grow in me. I like that." 

 I sighed, feeling her hips grind against me. "God, I'm so spoiled."  

 

 

===

Sandy laughed, rising up to a sitting position. "Nobody deserves it more." She turned to Sheri. "Share the ride?" 

 Sheri looked nervous. "You think I can?" 

 "Yeah, but if you can't, no big deal. We're going to get there. We know that now, right?" She climbed off of me, and Sheri straddled my waist. Sandy turned around and sat on my chest, that sweet perfect ass of hers inches from my face. "Look at me," she told Sheri. "Don't even think about it. Let him in, and look at me, baby." 

 Sandy reached down and held my cock, wiggling it in place, until I felt the head settle home. "Let me fill you, beautiful," Sandy whispered and Sheri slowly lowered herself down. 

 When she was completely filled, Sandy hugged her. "I'm so happy right now. I can't tell you how good this makes me feel." 

 Sheri giggled, and the sound was wonderful. "Makes me feel pretty good to." 

 Sandy chuckled. "I bet." She gave Sheri a short little kiss. "I'm going to get out of your way now." 

 "No!" Sheri whispered. "Not yet. Stay with me, like this. I want to feel your arms around me a little longer, please?" 

 Sandy nodded, hugging her, rocking with her, telling her how wonderful she was, how beautiful, how sexy. She giggled. "Robert would have a heart attack seeing this." She stroked Sheri's hair. "Someday, right? You'll let him see us together? Hold me while he fucks me?" 

 Sheri nodded. "Of course. I'd do anything for you." 

 Sandy pulled away slowly. "I want to see you two together, alright? I'm right here." 

 She climbed off of me, laying beside me, head on my shoulder. "Isn't she beautiful?" 

 "Yeah, but I'm prejudiced. Most beautiful girl in the world. And she's mine." 

 Sandy giggled, and gave me a pinch. "Ours. I won't even insist on 50/50, but don't you dare lock me out." 

 "Shame on you to even suggest that. Ours. But I get first dibs on all the good stuff." 

 I looked up at Sheri, and opened my arms to her, beckoning. She laid down on my chest, and I held her. "Are we one screwed up relationship, or what?" 

 She giggled. "You don't like it?" 

 "I love it. I love you. But no way is this normal. I'm lying here telling your lover I love her, and arguing over who you belong to. Talking about her fiancée and you two together." 

 "Does that bother you?" she asked nervously. 

 "No. I mean, it probably should. I've not had the best track record with women, you know. Two cheaters who left me. I'm still a little insecure I guess." 

 "If you don't want me to, we won't do it. He's not going to get me. He'll only be with her." 

 "No. He should get to see you two together. It's amazing. She's going to be his wife. I want you to be with them, however you're comfortable. Just remember that you're mine, Ok?" 

 She sighed, pressing back against me as my cock continued its short, redundant journey inside of her. Her lips brushed my neck. "I love this, here, now, with the two of you. I can't believe how wonderful it feels, you inside me, like this." 

 Sheri lifted her head, looking into my eyes. "Can we stay like this? Love me gently just like this, until you fill me again? Please?" 

 I chuckled, hugging her. "Forever, if you want." 

 After that, there wasn't a lot of kissing, or talking. I held her, making love endlessly. She was completely relaxed, and I knew that the excitement level for her was nothing compared to much of what she'd done, but it was perfect, nonetheless. Joined and together. 

 The world was narrowed to the two of us. Eyes closed, feeling her weight on me, her body mine, my cock inside of her. 

 "I love you," she whispered. 

 "Love you to." 

 It was wonderful, but nothing lasts forever. I was ready for her. I thrust a little harder, deeper, hands on her delightful ass cheeks. "Coming for you," I whispered. 

 She whimpered softly, pushing back against me for a few more strokes until I pushed in to the limit and yielded. 

 She hugged me, and I could feel her body shaking. She was crying softly. 

 "What's wrong, baby?" I asked. 

 "Nothing. It's perfect. I never thought it could be like this. So perfect. Thank you," she whispered, brushing her tears away. 

 I chuckled. "You've got to stop crying. I thought maybe I'd hurt you." 

 She laughed, her tight little pussy pushing my wilting cock out. "Get used to it. I'm a girl. I cry. It's not a bad thing." 

 Sandy bounced onto the bed next to us, grinning. "Man, that was great. I guess my job is done here. Unless you want me to stay. I don't want to be a third wheel." 

 Sheri giggled. "Your job is definitely not done. You've got some serious cleaning up to do. And there's no way you're leaving this bed tonight, even if I have to tie you down to keep you here." 

 Sandy pouted. "All I get is clean up duty? Where's the love, Sher?" 

 "Clean us up, and I'll show you the love. Besides, when he wakes up hard, who's going to take care of him? My poor kitty is already complaining about the beating she's taken. She's not used to this. You're going to have to deal with him in the morning." 

 She did. Twice. Sheri got clean up duties. I don't know what they had against a warm washcloth. That had always worked for me in the past, but I wasn't about to complain. 

 Hell of a way to start the day. 

 * * * 

 It wasn't perfect after that. We still had issues. A couple of times she had to get on the phone with Sandy, and talk things out, before she could calm down enough for sex. Sandy came over at least a couple of times a week. We kept the suite for almost a full month, until I found a nice apartment for us. 

 I had a surprise for her. When we moved out of the hotel and into our apartment, I stopped her in front of the door. Her eyes got big as I dropped to one knee. 

 "Make me the happiest man in the world, Sheri? Say you'll marry me. Let me take care of you forever. Please? I love you, and don't want to live without you." 

 I opened the box and held it out to her. I'd manage to finagle a ring shopping trip with her mother and Sandy. They picked out the setting, a simple solitaire, round cut. Less than three carats, nothing ostentatious. I would have gone with something fancier, diamonds on the sides, but I went with their advice. Not cheap, but considerably less than the cost of a month in the hotel. 

 Sheri dropped to her knees, hugging my neck, tearing up. "Forever. I swear. Forever and ever." 

 I put the ring on her hand, and she was crying hard. I lifted her in my arms, and opened the door. 

 The room held about twenty of our closest friends and family. All my gang, her parents, Sandy and Robert of course. About a dozen of her long time friends. She was mortified at first, to be caught crying, but was soon running around showing off her ring. It was a wonderful moment, to see her like that. Happy, at ease with everyone, men and women alike. Glowing. 

 Dan laughed. "You just can't take your eyes off her, can you? Sometimes I wish I knew what that was like." 

 "Giving up your tomcatting days?" I teased. 

 "Hell no. Not 'til I find one like yours. I don't mind the search." 

 "Speaking of the search, how's the other one going?" 

 He looked around cautiously. "Not much progress. It's getting kind of expensive. You sure you want to keep going?" 

 "Every penny I have, if needed." 

 He chuckled. "We're not talking that kind of expensive. We'll stay on it. I'll let you know if we have any progress." 

 Three nights later, I was staying up alone, drinking heavily. She was with them. I knew I said it would be Ok, but my stomach thought otherwise. It was unfair, I know. Robert had been so good about everything. I guess I'm just not built the same. It was eating me up. The phone rang several times, but it was never her, and I didn't pick up. I fell asleep on the couch, watching some damn 50's black-and-white gangster movie. 

 I woke to her holding me. I reached around her and hugged her tight. "You look terrible," she said softly. "Did it upset you that much? He barely even touched me, nothing more than a friendly hug or caress. I swear." 

 "I'm sorry," I whispered. "I know it's not fair, but I hated it. Not knowing. I trust you, I trust both of them, but I couldn't stop wondering." 

 "Shh. It's Ok. It's done. He was ecstatic. Sandy was so happy it almost hurt. You did a kind and wonderful thing, but we never have to do it again." 

 "They don't want to?" I asked. 

 She giggled. "Of course they want to. I don't. Not without you. Never again without you. I loved being there for her, but I didn't like it. Being a sideshow. I thought I'd like it better. I missed you every damn minute of it." 

 "I don't want to be selfish," I told her. 

 "You're not. Robert's different. He likes to hear about it. He gets off on it. Sandy loves sharing and teasing him. It works for them, but they're not us. I could never do what she does, and we both know you're nothing like him. Not in that way. It's alright." 

 "Were you naked?" 

 She nodded. "As a baby. He got an eyeful. I got her off for him at least half- a-dozen times, then he fucked the shit out of her for a good thirty minutes or more. I...I couldn't go down on her after that. I think I disappointed them both a little. I just couldn't. She got me off a couple of times, barely, but it really wasn't about me. It was all about Sandy." 

 "She was happy?" 

 "Delirious. They both were. You did a good thing. We did a good thing." 

 I nodded. "That's what matters most. I...I can bear it, I guess, if it's that important to them. I understand if you ever want to do it again." 

 "No. Not a fucking chance in hell. Maybe if you're there too. I could deal with the four of us, but not without you. Don't even ask me to." 

 "I won't. I'm selfish. I want you for me, and me alone." 

 "And Sandy," she teased. 

 "Ok. Sandy too. Sharing you with her is different, you know?" 

 "Of course. We all love each other. I don't love Robert like that. I know you don't." 

 She hasn't done that again. Not the three of them. 

 * * * 

 It was four months of bliss before we got the first nibble. Dan kept me updated, while progress proceeded on the first investment that Robert had located. We were at dinner, the four of us, Sandy & Robert, still newlyweds, and Sheri and me. I received the text from Dan. "Target acquired. CP Southeast corner. 15 minutes." 

 I tried to act calmly, but gave my dinner companions my apologies. "Urgent meeting," I explained. "Can I impose on you to give Sheri a ride home?" 

 Sheri was confused. "Urgent meeting? You never have urgent meetings," she said. 

 "Rarely. I can't miss this one. I really have to run. I'm sorry. I'll see you tonight." 

 I grabbed a cab and was dropped at the Ritz Carlton a couple of blocks away, making my way to the rendezvous from inside the park. The Grand Army Plaza, with all the horse and carriages begging for tourists was a great place for anonymity. The plain grey Ford pulled up and I hopped in the back. It was dusk, and the light was fading. 

 "Twenty minutes ago," Mark said. "Dan is with him, Jaime's on his way. Our resources have left the building." 

 We took the Brooklyn Bridge and headed south to the Port Authority. As we drove up to one in a long line of identical warehouses, the metal garage door opened, and we pulled inside quickly. It lowered behind us, before the lights came on. Mark walked with me to the door leading to a stairwell. Dan was standing at the base of the stairs. "No information yet. We really haven't tried so far. Confirmed ID. Definitely one of the four." 

 A red light started blinking, followed by a soft beeping. I could hear the motor for the garage door operating above. A few seconds later, Jaime came walking down the stairs. He looked like I felt. 

 Funny how the women thought he was a big cuddly teddy bear. Grizzly was more like it. Dan moved in front of him and was almost bowled over as Jaime walked through him as if he didn't exist. 

 "Don't kill him..." Mark started speaking rapidly. "We need information." 

 Jaime walked up to the guy, and slapped him on the side of the head hard enough to lift the guy and his chair off the ground, toppling him sideways. "I want him when you're done," he growled. 

 Dan had hold of one massive arm. "That's not your call," he said calmly. It's up to Steve." 

 It was not a pretty scene. Nothing scientific or calculated. Mark worked on the guy for a couple of hours, until we were certain we had all the information we could get out of the bastard. None of us were professionals in this line of work, but I believe we did an adequate job as motivated amateurs. 

 Dan was carefully taking notes, asking questions, repeating them in different ways, going over previous details, until he was satisfied. "Let Jaime have him," he finally said. He turned and walked up the stairs. Mark picked up his tools and followed suit. 

 I stood beside Jaime, seeing the veins bulge on his temple. I almost felt bad for the guy. After over three years, I'm sure he thought he'd gotten away with it. Just a little fun, right? 

 "Go ahead," I told Jaime. 

 We weren't wearing masks or trying to disguise ourselves. This piece of filth would never identify us to anyone. Not in his short lifetime. 

 I knew Jaime was dangerous. He had a temper that had gotten him in serious trouble before. Getting him out of the trouble, once a long time ago, was how our friendship was originally born. What I saw scared me. For well over an hour Jaime 'tended' to our guest. He didn't talk to him, didn't explain, didn't threaten. No hope for the future, for escape, for redemption. Not for this piece of shit. He didn't use anything but his own hands, knees, elbows and feet. He must have broken half the bones in the guys body, methodically snapping his ribs one at a time with his boots. I refuse to describe what he did below the waist. 

 The guy was still alive, somehow, when Jaime moved the chair out of the way, and centered his victim in the large plastic sheet. He looked over at me, and even though I was feeling nauseous, I had to add my own signature to the effort. I unzipped and pissed on the fucker, in his face, taking my time, shaking off the last few drops. 

 Jaime folded the ends of the plastic in, and rolled it up. If he was still alive, it wouldn't be for long. Suffocation was too good for him anyway. He took a roll of duct tape off the table and tossed it to me. I strapped the plastic closed, while he held it off the ground. He delivered one last massive kick, and turned away. We walked up the stairs, and he sighed. "I feel better, how about you, Ace?" 

 "Twenty percent or so," I told him. 

 He laughed. "Yeah, that's about right. It's a start." 

 * * * 

 I picked up flowers on the way home. I thought I'd be in deep shit for my abrupt departure, but I didn't expect the reception I got. Sheri flew into my arms, making me drop the flowers to catch her. 

 "I was so worried for you. You've been gone for hours. I couldn't get hold of you." 

 I hugged her, my precious gamer girl, my wife-to-be. I didn't say anything, just held her, until the tears stopped flowing. What she'd gone through. How close I'd come to losing her altogether before I even had a chance to meet her. How she'd suffered. 

 "What's wrong?" she asked. 

 "I love you, Sheri. More than anything." 

 She clung to me. "Do you want to tell me what this is all about?" 

 "No. I'm not going to lie to you, but I'm asking you to stay out of this. Please." 

 "I'm your wife. Your life partner now. You shouldn't be keeping secrets from me," she said. 

 I picked her up in my arms and sat down in the living room, with her on my lap. "Please. I can't talk about this." 

 "The wives are upset. Something bad's happening, isn't it? We're not in trouble are we? Maria's frantic." 

 "No. It's something we have to do. With luck it'll all be over soon, alright? I don't ask for much do I? Let this one go." 

 She stared into my eyes, and slowly nodded. "Someday." 

 "Maybe. I don't know." 

 She hugged me. "Take me to bed, Steve. I'm scared. I need you close." 

 I didn't tell her that I hoped in the near future, she'd never have to be scared again. 

 * * * 

 Five more weeks. Cost us well over a million dollars in all. Dan was funneling our company funds through two offshore accounts. I had told him to use my money, but he insisted on using the business, so everybody was paying in, almost $200K a piece for them. Angela had a cow, but Mark laid down the law, which he so rarely did, and she let it go as well. There was stress at the home front, with the impromptu meetings and hush-hush discussions. 

 The third one gave me nightmares. He was the worst of the perpetrators, and Jaime wanted vengeance in kind. "You like forcing sticks and bottles up inside little girls, you piece of shit? Let's see how you like it?" 

 He didn't, and I was certain his screams would stick with me for the rest of my life. Jaime was careful with him, not wanting him to pass out too early. The bastard suffered for hours, until one of the bottles broke. That didn't stop Jaime. The fucker's not suffering now. 

 A lucky break found the evil son-of-a-bitch who had taken advantage of her after she'd made her escape. We thought that was a lost cause, but we had a huge reward out, and the idiot had to boast. He was in prison, behind bars. That actually made it easier. Dan told me it cost less than $20k. Only an extra couple of grand to have "Child Raper" tattooed across his forehead. That scumbag suffers every day, reminded of what he did each time. He's only in for three years, but he'll never walk out alive. Never hurt anyone again. 

 The four of us met for a beer when it was all over. We didn't talk about it, but we silently toasted each other. Dan was in a quiet mood, and ordered a round of shots. He lifted his. "To CherryBomb." 

 We drank to my fiancée, and agreed never to mention the subject again. Five scumbags who'd nearly destroyed one young girl's life, would never harm anyone again. I had no sympathy for them, none. I didn't know if they left family behind, if they'd changed their lives for the better, if they regretted what they'd done. I didn't care. They got what they deserved. 

 Time to move on. 

 * * * 

 It was only a week later, when I found out that someone had let the cat out of the bag. I knew it wasn't me. 

 We were visiting Sheri's family. Her father and Sheri had gone out to pick up dinner. I was sitting in the living room, when Carol walked in, took my drink from me, and sat in my lap, shocking the hell out of me. 

 She put her arms around my neck, and kissed me on the cheek. She hugged me closely. "Thank you," she said softly. 

 I was confused, and started to talk, but she put her finger over my mouth. "Shh. I don't want to know. It was a foolish, dangerous thing, but thank you. I won't mention it again." 

 My heart was racing, and I wondered how much had gotten out, and who knew. She could only be talking about our 'equalizing'. We didn't consider it revenge. We considered it balance. 

 Sheri acted like nothing had happen, but she was nervous that night, like she hadn't been in months. I held her, until we both fell asleep. I knew I'd have to call the guys and see if we needed any kind of damage control. 

 When I woke Sandy was in bed with us. I had no idea when that happened. She was lying there facing me, spooning Sheri. When she saw I was awake, she gave a nod toward the bedroom door, and followed me out to the family room. 

 "She had a bad night," Sandy said softly. She took me by the hand and sat me on the couch climbing in my lap and holding me. "We know, Steve. The wives, me and Carol. Not Robert. Not her father. Just us. That's all it will ever be." 

 "I had to do it," I tried to explain. 

 She had tears in her eyes and hugged me tight. "I know. I don't know exactly what you did, none of us do. We don't want to know. All that matters is that five of the dregs of society will never hurt anyone again, and Sheri won't be looking over her shoulder the rest of her life."  

 

 

===

She grinned. "Remind me never to get on your bad side." 

 "She wasn't supposed to know. It wasn't about that." 

 Sandy nodded. "And she'll never let on that she does. This is the last that I or anyone else will ever talk about it, Ok? If she needs to discuss it, she'll talk to me, Maria, or her mother. As far as she's ever to know, it's our secret, as much as it's yours. You boys have yours, and this is ours." 

 She had a nervous look. "I...Should I be scared of Jaime?" 

 I laughed. "Not in this lifetime. Anyone who ever thinks of hurting any of you women, that's different. He takes that whole 'protector' thing to another level. Please don't ask me anymore." 

 She kissed me hard, curling my toes. "I love you, Steve Jeffery. Thank you." 

 "I love you too, Sandy. Thank you for being there for her, when I couldn't." 

 She smiled, and got up, taking me by the hand. "She shouldn't wake up alone." I thought she'd get on the other side of Sheri, but she climbed in with me on my side. "As long as you and I are up, what do you say I start a down-payment on a lifetime of rewards you've earned, Mister White Knight?" 

 I chuckled softly. "I've already got my reward, thank you very much, beautiful. Marrying her in a few weeks. With that said, I sincerely doubt I'll ever be able to say no to you." 

 She grinned. "Then don't. I'll never say no to you. You don't mind banging a prego?" 

 She laughed at my surprised look. "How can you not know? Did you think I was getting fat? Two months along now. Honeymoon baby. Good thing. Last thing I want is for my first baby to look like you. No offense, but he is my husband. Besides, you're not a bad looking guy, but hubby's a hunk." 

 I wasn't about to argue. Those two hit the genetic jackpot. That was going to be one damn good-looking kid. 

 Sandy was riding me quietly, trying to keep our movement to a minimum, when sleeping beauty woke up. She smiled sleepily, and snuggled up against me. "How're my two favorite people in the world doing?" she whispered. 

 "Pretty wonderful," Sandy said. 

 Sheri closed her eyes, kissing my shoulder. "Take care of him. He's the best, you know." 

 "We'll take care of him. Always. Together, right?" Sandy said, relaxing on my body, reaching out and brushing Sheri's hair from her face. 

 "Forever and ever. I promised," Sheri whispered. 

 * * * 

 I don't know what the future holds. I can hope for the best. I have great friends, the best girl in the world, and family I could only dream of growing up. The doctors think Sheri should be able to get pregnant and carry a child to term. 

 Tomorrow's the big day. Sheri's hoping that we can follow in Sandy's footsteps, getting pregnant on our honeymoon. We're taking a 12 day cruise on Crystal Cruises, from Lisbon to Miami, where everyone's joining us for a 17 day Discover America journey. Robert can only make a week of it, so Sandy will be joining Sheri and me in our Penthouse Suite. It only has a queen-size bed, so it should be cozy, especially with Sandy four months pregnant. Robert was teasing that she gets cold at night, so we have to let her be in the middle. Apparently the cats out of the bag about our unusual relationship. I have no idea when that happened, but it seems I'm always the last to know about everything. 

 We're all excited about the trip. Robert's not part of the core four yet, I'm not sure he'll ever be. He's more like the wives, included, accepted, loved, but unable to crack our inner sanctum. Sheri's closer to that than anyone. Not so much for what she is or has done, but from what we did for her, and learned in doing. She stole a little of all of our hearts. She has Jaime wrapped around her little finger almost as bad as Marie. They're like sisters, a clique within the clique, of Sheri, Sandy, and Marie. Angela's business keeps her a little out of center, and Dan's girl of the hour doesn't stand a chance, although he swears this one is a keeper. Sandy assures me he's wrong, but she's on the lookout for the right one. 

 This time spent together, our first group vacation, we're hoping will strengthen us even more. Kind of scary. I don't know if we can get much closer. The women are already threatening to make it an annual thing. 

 We rarely game anymore. I miss it. Sheri assures me it's temporary, but we're busy getting on with our lives, making families, even (shudder) earning a living. That's right. We have an office in Manhattan. Go in at least three times a week. The wives were a little pissed when we shifted operations from D.C. to Manhattan, and we've been dealing with the moves, and new offices since. Angela was especially unhappy, until her company offered her a raise and promotion to move to Manhattan. It's good to know people. 

 It was less than a year ago that I was a lonely, depressed man, self-isolated, with little ambition, and not much going for me other than three very good friends. Victim of two disastrous marriages, including a total betrayal. I'd lost my company, which I'd worked so hard for. The only thing I was good at was a stupid game, which almost consumed my life. Thank God, or I would never have met CherryBomb. 

 Today I'm on top of the world. I've got the greatest girl, which makes everything else in life that much sweeter. There'll never be any question about her love for me. If anything in life is true, that is. How could I be any happier? 

 I'm getting married tomorrow.
