 ****** The Bought Husband Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "Jack, Gloria would like to see you in her office." 

 It was the one thing that no one at Stearns Inc. wanted to hear because it usually meant that you were history. Gloria Stearns believed that she owed it to the people getting bad news to get it from her direct and not from some lower minion. The current economy sucked and Stearns was downsizing and it looked like I was on my way to the unemployment line. 

 I knocked on the door to Gloria's private office and heard her say "Come in." I opened the door and stepped into her office as she came out from behind the desk and walked toward me with her hand out-stretched in greeting. I felt the same tingle in my groin that I got every time I saw her. Tall, willowy and with runway model good looks she lit any number of fires as she walked through the office. I took her hand as she said, "Jack, how nice to see you. Have a seat." 

 After shaking hands she moved back behind the desk and sat down. As I took a seat she picked up a folder on her desk, glanced through it quickly, looked up at me and then back down at what I could only assume was a file on me. 

 "How long have you been here at Stearns Jack?" 

 Eleven years. I came to work for your father right out of high school." 

 "It must have been hard for you to work here full time while going to college at night." 

 "It wasn't easy Miss Stearns, but your father helped me a lot." 

 "Yes, I know. For some reason he never explained he looked on you almost as a son. He even loaned you the money for your education and then forgave the loan as a graduation present. Why did he do that Jack?" 

 "I don't know." 

 "Yes you do Jack, and what's more, so do I. Why did you do it Jack? Why did you stick your neck out like that?" 

 "Your father was a good man Miss Stearns and I wasn't about to let that bitch screw up your father's life." 

 "Was the money for your education a pay-off Jack?" 

 "No mam. Your father had already given me the loan and had already forgiven it as a graduation present. I guess that is one of the reasons that I did it. He didn't have to help me; he did it out of the goodness of his heart and you don't standby and watch a man like that get shafted by some money grubbing little bitch." 

 "You're lucky that they didn't have DNA testing back then; it could have blown your story out of the water." 

 "Not really. There was a fifty-fifty chance that it would have proven my story." 

 "You and daddy both did her?" 

 "I don't know that your father ever did, but half of the guys in the mail room did and anyone of us could have been the father." 

 "Still, what made you stand up when she said my father made her pregnant and say that she told you that she knew it wasn't his, but was going for the big bucks?" 

 "Loyalty." 

 "My, but you are old fashioned aren't you." 

 "As far as I'm concerned loyalty never goes out of style." 

 "Any chance that the loyalty you felt toward my father could extend to other family members?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Just that Jack. Any chance that your loyalty to my dad could bleed over to me?" 

 "I still don't understand Miss Stearns." 

 "I'm in trouble Jack and I am in desperate need of a knight in shining armor to come to my rescue." 

 "I'll do what I can Miss Stearns." 

 "Maybe Jack, and maybe not. You need to know up front that my knight is going to be severely shit upon, will suffer outrageous indignities for almost five years and may very likely learn to hate the sight of me. I would like you to have dinner with me tonight Jack. We can discuss it someplace where I don't have to worry about the walls having ears. Can I pick you up around seven?" 

 "Yes, of course. I'll give you directions." 

 "I don't need directions Jack, I know where you live." 

 The curiosity must have been all over my face because she said, "You'll get the answers tonight Jack, just be patient." 

 Just be patient! Easy for her to say, but not at all easy for me to do. How did she know where I lived? What did she mean with that comment about the wall having ears? What could she possibly want from me and why did she think I might do it knowing that I was going to be, as she put it, shit upon? I sat at my desk and didn't get a damned thing done for the rest of the day. I couldn't concentrate on my job for beans; all I could think about was our dinner that night and what she could possibly want me to do that would make me hate her on sight before it was over. 

 "I want you to marry me Jack." 

 I was stunned. I had expected something a little way out following our conversation in the limo on the way to the restaurant, but nothing anywhere close to that. I'd no sooner settled on the seat than she looked over at me and took a deep breath. 

 "I'm going to hang it all out tonight Jack and I praying that I can trust you to keep what we talk about in confidence even if you decide not to do what I'm about to ask of you. To be frank I do not expect that you will do it. God knows I wouldn't do it if it were me. The only reason I think I can ask it of you is your relationship with my dad. Do you know that it is in his will that you have a job for life at Stearns? That you can never be fired or laid off?" 

 "I had no idea." 

 "You were never supposed to know. The only reason that I'm telling you is so that won't fear for your job if you say no to what I'm going to ask. Can you do that Jack? Can you promise me that no matter what your decision is tonight what we talk about stays between the two of us?" 

 "You already know that I will Miss Stearns or we wouldn't even be having this conversation." 

 "Under the circumstances Jack I think you should start calling me Gloria. Here we are," she said as we pulled up in front of the restaurant. "As soon as you get your first drink under your belt I'll hit you with the bomb." 

 The look on my face amused her and she smiled. "I know a thousand things have gone through your mind since this morning, but I'll bet that wasn't one of them, was it?" 

 "No mam, not anything close to that." 

 "I told you Jack, it's Gloria. So, how does the idea sound to you so far?" 

 "I'm afraid I don't understand Miss St...Gloria." 

 "I'll spell it out for you Jack. For purely financial reasons I need a husband and for purely personal reasons my lover can't be the man I marry." 

 "I still don't understand." 

 "I'm not going to explain why I can't marry my lover, but I will explain the rest. My father, for reasons known only to him, wrote his will in such a way that if I am not married by the time I reach thirty my trust funds, there are three of them, will revert to various charities and foundations. I will be thirty in seven months. I can not marry the man I love, but I am totally unwilling to let my money go to some group that wants to save whales, hug trees or secure habitat for some goddamned mouse. So, I need a husband, but it has to be a special kind of husband. He has to understand that he is a husband in name only and that sex in the marriage will be minimal and almost totally one sided. He will be verbally abused and humiliated and he will have to put up with it for five years before he can get a divorce and a some point in that five year period he will need to father a child. Does that sound like something that you might be interested in Jack?" 

 "Uh, no, not really." 

 "Well then, let me tell you the rest of it. Two point five million dollars deposited in a Cayman Islands bank account, which will make it tax-free. You will not be able to access it until the five years is up. You will live with me and I'll pay all the bills, furnish the cars, the country club memberships and anything else you will require, need or want and you will get an annual spending allowance of ten thousand a month. In return you have to promise to be a faithful husband for five years and put up with whatever indignities I send your way. Sound a little better now?" 

 "Some, but there are major concerns." 

 "What are they?" 

 "Minimal sex and I'm to remain totally faithful. No, not at my age and definitely not for five years." 

 "If I can do something about the sex part how does the rest sound?" 

 "What I would get sounds fine, but my concerns are the other things you mentioned; the indignities, the verbal abuse and the humiliation. I need to know more, much, much more about those things." 

 "There would be no physical abuse Jack, but there will be a lot of verbal abuse, most intended to humiliate you. It will be all mental Jack and it shouldn't bother you because you will know it is coming and you will also know that it is all bullshit because of your status. You won't be the cuckolded husband, just a play actor." 

 "I still want to know what I'm getting into." 

 Gloria looked at me and I saw that she was thinking of how to say the absolute least and still win me over so I said, "Okay, how about this. I'll agree in principal to do it, but only after full disclosure and to insure full disclosure I'll want an agreement in writing releasing me from the five year obligation to get the offshore money if you have not disclosed every thing. I also want the written agreement to release the money to me if the marriage does not go the full five years through no fault of mine." 

 She looked at me for almost a full minute with her piercing blue eyes and then she said, "Deal" and extended her hand to me and we shook on it." 

 It turned out to be something simple, but kinky. Her lover was a black man named Jumal Washington and for reasons she would not go into she could not marry him or let her relationship with him see the light of day. Her fathers will stipulated marriage by thirty, the marriage to last a least five years and a grandchild by the age of thirty-five. While married to her I would have to put up with Jumal and he was, quite frankly, an obnoxious asshole. Her few close friends who knew about Jumal could not stand him and they were constantly asking Gloria what she saw in him. 

 "Love is blind Jack. I know he is an asshole sometimes, but I still adore him even though I know it. It doesn't matter what he does Jack; I'll find excuses for him. You know about that don't you Jack? You've been there and done that with Shelly so you know what it is like." 

 "How did you know about Shelly?" 

 "I know everything about you Jack. I've had private detectives all over you since I chose you to be my husband. I try not to take chances Jack. I knew of the bond between you and my father and I gambled that it might work in my favor, but there is 31 million at stake here Jack so I made it my business to know everything about you that there was to know. Just out of curiosity, how long did you know about Shelly before you ended it?" 

 "Two years, eleven months, one week, three days, two hours and fifteen minutes." 

 "You let it go on that long?" 

 "You said it yourself; love is blind and you find excuses. I'd still be finding excuses if I hadn't walked in on them. Even then it was only because of who it was that I tossed her out. A lover I might have been able to handle, but her father and her brother and both of them at the same time? I just couldn't handle it." 

 "So, will you do it?" 

 "Full disclosure Gloria. There is still that little matter of sex that has to be talked about. I especially want to hear about the minimal and totally one sided part." 

 "Oh that." 

 "Yes, that." 

 "I love Jumal and I intend to stay faithful to him, at least after a fashion. You and I will have sex one time after the ceremony to legally consummate the marriage and then we won't have sex again until it is time to make the baby. That said, I have a certain need that Jumal absolutely refuses to meet. He is willing to let you do it to me and not consider it cheating, but only under certain circumstances." 

 "What is it and what are those certain circumstances?" 

 "Do we have to go into it now Jack?" 

 "Full disclosure Gloria. I am going to have to know sooner or later and anything that you don't want to talk about makes me nervous." 

 "I love to have my pussy eaten Jack, but Jumal absolutely refuses to do it. He says that it is beneath him to do such a thing. He will let me have you do it to me and not consider it cheating, but only after he has made love to me first. And there will be times he will want to watch." 

 "You can't be serious!" 

 "I am Jack, dead serious. Think of it Jack, one hundred and twenty thousand a year for five years as spending money and a 2 point five million dollar pot of gold at the end of a five year rainbow. You've done before Jack. You know that you have gone down on Shelly after she had been screwed and it hasn't killed you and you didn't have a pot of gold waiting for you after you did it. I'll make sure that you have a sex life Jack, it just won't be with me. So, will you do it?' 

 It was pretty much a no brainer. Five years of bullshit in exchange for almost three million dollars. Hell, I'd be thirty-six years old and set for life to say nothing of the life of luxury I'd live for five years. All I had to do was put up with some bullshit three or four times a week from some obnoxious asshole. I should be able to do that standing on my head. 

 I stared at Gloria as the wheels turned in my head and finally I said, "Three conditions. One, the signed agreement. Secondly, I get to approve whatever plan you come up with to see that I have a sex life. Last, but by no means least, our wedding night is mine and only mine." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "Two things. You have already said that your boyfriend will want to watch when I go down on you so I wouldn't put it past him to want to horn in on our wedding night. That will be a no-no. I don't want him within five miles of us on our wedding night. The second thing about it being my night is that you are mine for the night. Not just a quickie so you can honestly and with a straight face say that the marriage was consummated, but the entire night and we will do it all. I'll want anal, oral and vaginal sex with you on that night." 

 "I can't do that Jack; I would be cheating on Jumal." 

 "Yes you can Gloria. You have already accepted that you have to have sex with me on our wedding night and you have already decided that since you have to do it that it isn't cheating. What's the difference? One time or all night, it is all the same." 

 "I can't do it Jack. It just wouldn't be right." 

 "Your choice Gloria, but it is a deal breaker as far as I am concerned." 

 "You would throw away almost three million over that?" 

 "You would throw away almost thirty-one million over it?" 

 "I can always get someone else Jack." 

 "Yes, you could." 

 I picked up the menu and looked at it. "Is the prime rib any good here?" 

 "Don't change the subject Jack." 

 "No subject change Gloria. I told you what I have to have and you said that I couldn't have it. Subject closed. We came here for dinner and when we are done eating I'll catch a cab home and save you the trouble of having to drop me off." 

 "Why is that one thing so important to you Jack?" 

 "It is for my mental health Gloria." 

 "That doesn't make sense Jack." 

 "Not to you maybe, but it does to me." 

 "Can you explain it to me?" 

 "It is quite simple Gloria. You have already put me on notice that part of my earning the money is putting up with your asshole of a boyfriend for the next five years. I'm no dummy Gloria, I can even write the script for the next five years. It will start out with him rubbing my nose in the fact that he is fucking my wife and I'm not. It will move to him wanting me in the next room when he screws you so I can be on call to eat you when his stuff is still hot and fresh in you. He'll get tired of that after a while and he will want me to be in the room when he does it so I'm forced to watch. Then he will talk you into having me go sixty-nine with you while he screws you from behind so I can see him ramming you from only inches away from my face. Somewhere along the way, after he has seen me eat you a dozen times or so he will make the comment, "Wouldn't you just like to cut out the middleman and come over here and get it fresh from my dick?" 

 "And all the time I'm supposed to smile and take his shit. Well, I'll do it, but I want to be able to look at him and be able to say to myself, "I fucked your woman asshole. I came in her mouth, I pounded her butt hole and I did my best to fill her womb with my cum. Your woman asshole - I took your woman every way it was possible to take her so go ahead and babble because it don't mean shit to me." Like I said Gloria, it is a mental health issue with me and it costs you nothing because you were already going to have sex with me that night anyway." 

 "I guess I need to rethink a few things Jack. Yes, the prime rib here is very good. If you are ready, let's order." 

 After dinner she wouldn't let me call a cab and the ride home in her limo was a quiet one. As I was getting out she said, "We will talk again Jack, but first I have some thinking to do." 

 It was two days before Gloria called me into her office and told me to have a seat. As soon as I was seated she pushed a piece of paper across the desk to me, "There is your signed agreement on disclosure. Against my better judgement I am going to give you what you require as far as our wedding night is concerned. All that is left is to see that you have a sex life for the five years we are married. To keep things as discrete as possible and to preserve the outward appearance of utter faithfulness I've decided that whatever you do needs to be done in the confines of our home. I've decided that what I need a maid. Of course one of her cleaning duties will be to clean your pipes as often as you like. If that arrangement meets with your approval the next step will be to pick the right woman." 

 She opened her briefcase and took out a three ring binder and handed it to me. 

 "See if there is anyone in there who appeals to you. The ones with a line drawn across their face are not available." 

 I found myself looking at pictures of beautiful women. Each page had a couple of pictures, vital statistics and some information about the likes, dislikes and hobbies of the women. I looked up at Gloria and she smiled at me and said, "One of my very good friends owns a modeling agency and an escort service. I've been assured that the women in that book will be more than happy to do what I want of them for what I am willing to pay. Just pick one Jack and I'll make the necessary arrangements. If you get tired of her after a couple of months you can go back to the book and pick another one. Do we have a deal?" 

 While she had been talking I had been leafing through the book. Suddenly I stopped dead and stared at what I was seeing. Sally Ann was the wife of one of the guys I played softball with and I had lusted after her for years. 

 "All of the women in this book play for pay?" 

 Gloria nodded and I handed her back the book and pointed at Sally Ann. "That one." 

 "I take it that we have a deal?" 

 "Yes Gloria, we have a deal." 

 That's when my life began to get hectic. For the next three months there was a phony courtship followed by the announcement of our engagement, followed by a hundred parties given by friends and relatives. There were the wedding plans (according to the society pages of the local papers one of the "social events of the season") to be made, a honeymoon to be planned and through it all Gloria and I were seen almost every evening at some "In" place in town. By the day of our wedding our "bona fides" had been established, the society pages were calling us the perfect couple and friends and relatives positively gushed over how much in love with each other we so obviously were. 

 There was one glitch however, and I had to remind Gloria of it and she told me not to worry, it would be taken care of. I told her I wasn't worried because I knew the wedding wouldn't go off until it was taken care of. Two days later she handed me confirmation of deposit to my account in the Cayman Islands.  

 

 ****** The Bought Husband Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I still hadn't met Mr. Washington and I could only assume that Gloria had put him on ice until after the nuptials. Still, I scanned the crowd in the church looking for someone who might be Jumal. I figured that he was the kind of guy who would show up and sit in the back row and smirk as the "love, honor and obeys" were said. I wouldn't put it past him to have told Gloria that he would be there and just might have to speak his piece when it got to the "Is there anyone here who knows of any reason why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony." 

 I almost missed him. He had timed his arrival so that he sat down just as Gloria started down the aisle toward me. She was radiantly beautiful and as I looked toward her I saw Jumal take his seat and our eyes met and I got the sneer and smirk that I had known would be there. I smiled at him as I thought to myself, "Smirk all you want asshole, your woman is going to be my slut tonight and then after tonight I'll still have a part of her you will never have and I'll know it every time I eat her pussy." 

 As I watched Gloria walk down the aisle toward me I thought, and not for the first time, what a crying ass shame it was that this was all bogus. 

 The ceremony went off without a hitch and I don't think Gloria was ready for what she got when the minister said, "You may now kiss the bride." I made it a long lasting one as I looked over her shoulder in the direction of Jumal. I had hoped to see a slow burn, but his face remained impassive. It was childish of me and I knew it, but I was going to be on the receiving end of his shit for the next five years and I wanted to get my digs in whenever I could. 

 The reception was like all wedding receptions and at an appropriate time my bride and I changed clothes and escaped. Two miles from the reception the limo driver pulled off onto a side street. 

 "What are you doing?" Gloria asked the driver. 

 He pointed at me and I said, "I have a little surprise for you my love" as the limo pulled up behind a car that I had pre-positioned. 

 The driver helped me move the luggage from the limo to the car and then I handed him the five hundred I had promised him. While that was going on Gloria kept asking, "What are you doing Jack. What is going on here? Whose car is this?" 

 "Be patient my love, it will all be clear in a minute. " 

 As the limo sped off I told Gloria to get in the car. "I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what this is all about." 

 "Get in the car Gloria. I won't hesitate to drive off and leave you standing there. Then you can hitch hike to the honeymoon hotel and explain why you arrived without your new hubby." 

 Gloria gave me a murderous glance, but she got in the car. As I pulled away from the curb she said, "Okay Jack, just what the fuck is going on here?" 

 Tsk, tsk, Gloria, is that any way to talk to your new husband?" 

 "Cut the shit Jack, I want to know what you are doing." 

 "Simple my love, I don't trust you. You gave in on the 'my night only' demand way too easy. You are a schemer Gloria and I could hear the wheels and gears turning in your head. Promise him whatever he wants. Once the marriage has taken place, stiff him. He will already be married and he'll be a realist and he will behave because of the money." 

 "Jack, that's not true." 

 "Sure it is Gloria. The tight schedule you insisted we maintain - the schedule that would have us at the hotel by eleven and the marriage consummated by midnight. And then something was supposed to happen. Maybe you would get up and walk across the hall to the room where Jumal was waiting? Or maybe he was just going to knock on our door and you would get up and let him in to join us. I could have been wrong, but I knew I wasn't when the ceremony was over and I saw you make eye contact with Jumal. I saw him tap his watch and I saw the slight nod that you gave him. The fix was in and it was screw Jack time only Jack decided a long time ago that you couldn't be trusted so Jack made his own plans. Right now we are on our way to the motel where I will see to it that our marriage is consummated and that I get what you and I agreed on." 

 "This is not the way to start our marriage Jack." 

 "This isn't a marriage Gloria and you know that better than anyone. This is a business deal and I will honor my part of the deal. I said that I would and my word is as good as gold, but only if you honor your part of the bargain." I pulled over to the side of the road. "Choice time Gloria. If you don't intend to honor your part of the bargain get out and start hitch hiking. I'll start the annulment proceedings in the morning." 

 I saw the resignation come over her face and then she said, "Of course I will honor our agreement Jack. I'm just surprised that you don't trust me and that you thought I wouldn't." 

 "The marriage is a sham Gloria and we both know it, but let's not make it worse by starting out lying to each other. I saw the watch tap and the little nod and being the halfway intelligent guy that I am I made some phone calls from the reception hall. We were registered in room 1216 and there just happened to be a Mr. Jumal Washington registered in room 1220 and one of the things I was specific about was that he wasn't to be within five miles of us on our wedding night. I didn't just fall off the turnip truck my love and if you want this thing to work you had best not forget it." 

 As far as wedding night's go I suppose that it had it's good and it's bad. When we got to the "hot sheet" motel I had picked (knowing that no one would look for Gloria in a place like that) Gloria matter of factly stripped and laid down on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. The message was clear, "Let's hurry up and get this over with," but since that was what I had expected I had come prepared. I opened my suitcase, took out a book and handed it to Gloria. 

 "What's this? 

 "Something to keep you occupied while I enjoy my evening." 

 I got on the bed and pushed her legs apart and she said, "Aren't you forgetting something?" 

 "Nope." 

 "You most certainly are. Where is the condom?" 

 "Don't need one." 

 "Oh yes you do. I am not ready to get pregnant." 

 "You can't get pregnant from what I'm going to do. Just read your book," I said and then I went down on her. I like to eat pussy and I have been told that I'm extremely good at it. It didn't take me long to get Gloria to the point where she was moaning and pushing her pussy up at my mouth. I worked a finger into her pussy to get it wet and then I started teasing her anal rosebud. 

 "What are you doing?" she gasped and I stopped eating her long enough to say, "Just read your book Gloria and don't mind me." 

 I worked that finger in her ass for a couple of minutes and then I pushed another one in. I was sucking on her little 'man in the boat' while working her ass with two fingers and Gloria dropped the book and grabbed the back of my head with both hands and she did her best to pull me inside her cunt. I increased the pressure on her clit and added a third finger to her ass and she screamed - actually screamed - "Fuck me damn you, fuck me." 

 I smiled as I reached for the tube of KY Jelly that I had dropped on the bed when I had climbed on. I put some on my cock with one hand while I kept the fingers of the other on her clit to keep her moaning. When I was lubed up I grabbed her legs and lifted them up onto my shoulders, lifted her ass clear of the bed and then drove my cock into her ass. 

 "Arghhhhh" is the closest I can come to describing the yell that came out of her mouth as she tried to pull away, but I was buried deep in her and I had a firm grip on her so she was pinned there as I started pounding into her. Past experience had shown me that some women love anal sex; some just learn to like it and some never do. It didn't matter to me which category Gloria fell into because this night was all about me and I didn't give a rat's ass if she got anything out of it at all. Still, it was nice to see that after a minute or two of my plowing the dirt road that she was responding and soon she began hissing, "Yes yes yes yes" through her teeth. 

 To prepare for the night I had beat my meat eleven times in the past twenty- four hours just to make sure that my cock would stay up for quite a while. I pounded Gloria's ass for a good ten minutes while she moaned, yelled and cried. She had two orgasms before I was finally able to have mine. When my cock went limp I pulled my cock out of Gloria's ass and went into the bathroom to wash it. Gloria just lay on the bed and watched me with an unreadable expression on her face as I cleaned myself up. 

 I went back to the bed, pushed Gloria's legs apart and with my knees both just off to the side of her head I went down on her again. This time my fingers worked on her pussy instead of on her ass and once again her hands went to my head and she pulled me to her. I kept working on her until she cried out, "Please put it in me Jack, please fuck me." 

 I took my mouth off her pussy just long enough to say, "Can't do it. My dicks not hard enough yet" and I went back to working on her pussy with my mouth and fingers. She was humping up at me and crying out, "Fuck me Jack, please fuck me." I stopped eating her long enough to say, "As soon as my dick gets hard and I went back to working on her clit. Maybe thirty seconds went by and then I felt one of her hands on my cock. She stroked it several times and then scooted her head to the left and I felt her head push under me and her hot mouth close around my dick. It was what I had been hoping for. I wanted her to ask me for everything that I did to her and so far she had begged me to fuck her and now she was sucking my cock on her own which to me was the same as asking. 

 I let Gloria suck on me for about two minutes and then I swung around and got between her legs. I held myself still above her and looked down at her beautiful face and wished again that it were for real and not fake. 

 "Please" she said, "What are you waiting for? Hurry, hurry up and fuck me" and no mention was made of a condom. 

 I didn't get my wish. She never did ask me to fuck her in her ass even thought I did do it to her two more times. I made love to her (and yes it was) three more times and I ate her pussy after each time and it drove her wild. It was five in the morning when I finally fell into an exhausted sleep. I woke up at nine-thirty and the first thing I saw was Gloria leaning on her elbow and looking down at me. "What?" I asked as I sat up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. 

 "Nothing." 

 "Then why are you looking at me like that?" 

 "Why not? It is the first day of the rest of my life and the first time I've woken up with a husband in bed beside me." 

 "Yeah, well we know all about that husband shit." 

 I stood up and went over and picked up my pants. 

 "What are you doing?" 

 "Getting dressed so we can get this show on the road." 

 "You wake up with a naked me next to you and you want to get dressed?" 

 "The deal was that I was to get the night all to myself. Nights over, it is daylight outside and you should know by now that I'm going to live up to my end of the deal." 

 "The night isn't over until we are both out of bed and dressed." 

 I dropped my pants on the floor and got back into bed. "What changed your mind?" 

 "A girl only has one first night as a married woman. Besides, I told you that I love to have my pussy eaten and that you might have to do a lot of it. And last night I discovered just how big a turn on it can be when I'm full of cum. I want to do it some more Jack." 

 We didn't get checked out until two in the afternoon, which totally screwed up Gloria's carefully planned schedule. We missed our flight to St. Thomas and Gloria had to make a dozen phone calls to reschedule things. Since the next flight for the Islands didn't leave until the next day we drove to Gloria's house where I spent my first night in the room that was to be mine for the better part of the next five years. I heard Gloria on the phone trying to reach Jumal who, since he had adhered to Gloria's schedule, was already in St. Thomas. She never did reach him and she slammed the phone down in a fit of rage. I smiled to myself and thought, "True love never does run smooth." Actually, I hoped the asshole went SCUBA diving and a shark got him and with that pleasant thought on my mind I put my head down on the pillow and fell almost immediately to sleep.

 ****** The Bought Husband Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© The honeymoon was as bogus as the wedding had been. The script had been given to me well before hand so that I would be able to play my part so that any observer would only see what they thought was a happily married couple. Gloria was a conspiracy freak and she saw people everywhere whose sole purpose was to prove that she hadn't met the terms of her father's will. 

 "I know you don't believe it Jack, but the people in charge of the charities and foundations that will get the money if I don't meet the conditions of daddy's will are going to do their best to find a way to get that money. They like their half million a year salaries and they will do their absolute best to get my money. You absolutely have to be a convincing husband." 

 "Well if that is true Gloria, all they have to do is put an army of private detectives on the case and they will turn up the skinny on you and Jumal in no time." 

 "That won't matter Jack. There is nothing in daddy's will that says I can't cheat on my husband and if push comes to shove I'll fall back on that old standby, "I love my husband, but I'm a slave to a big, black cock." If that happens you will be shocked, but you love me so much that you will forgive me. Besides, I have a ton of personal security. You won't even know that they are they, but any private eye that tries to get close will meet them up close and personal. Money does have its advantages Jack." 

 The script had the two of us in the honeymoon suite and Jumal in a room just down the hall. I was to sleep in Jumal's room and he would be sleeping with Gloria. All the activities planned for the two weeks were scheduled to give Gloria and Jumal as much time together as possible while I read one of the many books I'd brought along, did crossword puzzles, or did whatever else I wanted with my time. 

 A typical night would have Gloria and I going out for dinner and dancing where we could be seen as a loving couple by anyone who was watching. When we got back to the hotel we would go back to our room where Jumal would be waiting and if no one else was in the hall Gloria would go into the honeymoon suite and I would go to Jumal's room. If anyone were in the hall we would both go into the suite and wait for the hallway to clear before I would go to the other room. 

 A typical day would have us going somewhere where we could be alone except that Jumal would already be there. One day we rented a boat and sailed it to a secluded cove and Gloria and Jumal did whatever they did (I didn't watch) while I sunbathed on the deck of the boat. At four in the afternoon Gloria came back aboard and we sailed the boat back and went to our room to get ready for another night of dinner and dancing. 

 The routine was broken on three of the nights when Gloria came into the room while I was sleeping and got into bed with me. She played with my cock until I woke up and when I was awake she sat on my face. 

 "Eat me Jack. Eat my pussy. Jumal left a big mess in me Jack; be a good hubby and clean me." 

 Well, it was part of the deal and I knew ahead of time that it was eventually going to happen so I did what I was hired to do. Gloria had been right in that I probably had sucked another man's leavings out of Shelly, but I had never known it so it hadn't bothered me at the time. In Gloria's case I knew for sure ahead of time that she had been fucked by Jumal. I was concerned that knowing that I was licking up an arrogant nigger's leftovers might translate into a quick trip to the porcelain throne. Surprisingly enough, Gloria didn't taste all that different from the times I had eaten her after cumming in her on our wedding night. I didn't like it, but it didn't kill me. 

 The honeymoon passed without incident and then we flew home. I returned to my job at Stearns, the same one that I had when it all started. After all, we couldn't have it said that I married the boss just to get ahead nor could we have it said that Gloria was playing favorites. I didn't care. I liked my job and I was good at it; good enough that everyone there knew I would make Regional Manager on my own merit. The only thing that changed was that Gloria and I rode to work together in the morning, had lunch together and then rode home together at night. Most nights when we got home Jumal was there waiting for us. 

 To the casual observer Jumal being at our house was explained by a snippet on the society page of the local newspaper. 

 "Apparently Gloria Stanton, nee Stearns, is having to redo the family manse to accommodate her new hubby." 

 When we got home there would be a van in the drive with Elate Construction on the side in big letters. Elate had employees, Jumal and his cousin Darrnel. Sometime shortly after Gloria and I returned home Darrnel would get in the van and drive off. The van had tinted windows so you couldn't tell if there was one man or twelve inside. Dinner would be a quiet affair as Jumal and Gloria didn't want to talk in front of me and I had nothing to say to them. After eating I would go either to my room or to the home office I had set up. 

 The first week went by with Jumal and me ignoring each other until it was time to go to bed and then I went to my room and they went to theirs. The second week Jumal started doing what I had always known that he would. 

 "Well, its bedtime. See you in the morning Jack. I'm going to take your wife upstairs and fuck her eyes out. You don't mind, do you?" 

 The next morning on the drive to work Gloria apologized to me for Jumal's behavior. 

 "No need to apologize. I knew it was coming. Don't forget that I already told I could write the script. The first act came just as I said it would. While we are on the subject, I'm ready for my sex life to begin." 

 "I'll get on it as soon as we get to the office." 

 At lunch Gloria told me that, "The woman you chose will start tomorrow. She can only be there during the day so you are going to have to take long lunches and I'm going to have to arrange some fake business meetings to explain your absences from work. All I'm asking is that you be discrete." 

 "I will have to come up with a story that will explain why a newly wedded husband is getting his sex from a play for pay lady. How do you feel about being a closet lesbian that just needed a husband for appearances sake?" 

 Gloria laughed, "I'm way ahead of you Jack. I had an interview with her shortly after you picked her out. I told her that our marriage was a little on the weird side, that we loved each other deeply, but that for medical reasons I couldn't have sex. I told her that I realized that you had certain needs and that I was seeing to it that they were met." 

 Gloria reached over and patted my knee, "She is being extremely well compensated Jack; try and see to it that I get my moneys worth." 

 That night Gloria came into my room after I had fallen asleep and woke me up by playing with my cock. As I was shaking the sleep out of my eyes I heard her say, "I'm overflowing Jack. Eat my pussy. Lick my pussy and clean me out." 

 I went home at lunchtime and found Sally Ann sitting on the living room couch reading a magazine. She looked up when I walked into the room and I saw the astonished look on her face. 

 "Jack! What are you doing here?" 

 "You didn't know?" 

 "Know what?" 

 "That I'm your date?" 

 "Good Lord no. If I had known that I would never have accepted this assignment." 

 "Am I that repulsive?" 

 "It isn't that Jack, it is just that you are friends with Fred and I've worked hard at keeping what I do from him." 

 "Well Sally, let me set your mind to rest. I've had the hots for you since the first time I laid eyes on you and when I saw your page in the agency's book I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I picked you out of that book because I've wanted you for years. Do you really think that I would blow my chance at you by running to Fred and telling him that I screwing his wife?" 

 "When you put it that way, no, I guess you wouldn't." 

 "So, you want to be romanced or do we get right to it?" 

 "A little romance might be nice, but maybe later. Right now I think we should get to the business at hand so I see what I have to work with." 

 "Any limits?" 

 "I don't do animals or anything that involves pain, but I'm pretty much open to anything else." 

 "Well I'm a pretty ordinary kind of guy who is into oral, anal and regular sex and usually wants all he can get." 

 "You sure married the wrong girl for that from what I hear." 

 "What can I say? Love is blind. She told me she wanted to be a virgin when she married so we never fooled around first. I didn't find out about her medical problems until after I said "I do." But I love her and if she is willing to set me up with someone like you to take care of the sex angle I can live with it." 

 "It's your house baby, lead the way." 

 Sally was every bit the hot piece of ass I'd always thought she would be and we bounced around on my bed most of the afternoon. She gave the most glorious head, loved being fucked in her butt and was multi orgasmic. I was trying for one more time when she said; "I can't Jack. I have to get home before Fred and have his supper ready when he gets home." 

 "Won't he know what you have been doing when you go to bed? Won't he be able to tell from how your pussy feels?" 

 Sally giggled, "How would he know the difference Jack? There hasn't been a day since we got married that he was the first man in me and that includes our wedding day. Should I just come back tomorrow or wait for you to call?" 

 "Tomorrow sex-pot. Same time, same script." 

 Sally Ann giggled, kissed me and took off for home and a husband who didn't have a clue. But hey, who was I to laugh at poor Fred. He was married to a woman who got paid to fuck other men and here I was married to a woman who paid me not to fuck her. 

 Life settled into a routine for the next nine months. Two and sometimes three times a week Sally and I would have a good time together. Gloria would come to my room two or three nights a week to have her sloppy, cum filled pussy eaten. Jumal was his usual obnoxious self and there were times I want to smack that stupid sneer off his face or knock him on his ass. I just could not see what Gloria saw in that asshole. But as bad as I wanted to hurt the son of a bitch I didn't; I just thought back to my "mental health" night with Gloria and let things ride. 

 Because of Gloria's position and her involvement in community and charitable affairs I found myself out in public playing the role of loving and adoring husband as we attended this civic function or that charitable dinner and I began to notice some things. There actually were people who were watching us and watching us close. I began to think that Gloria's paranoia was not necessarily misplaced. About the same time something else occurred to me. I was playing the part of loving husband, but Gloria was not playing the part of adoring wife, at least not to the extent that I thought she should. 

 One night at a do for the Girl Scouts I noticed a man closely observing us and I'd seen him doing the same thing at several other affairs. Gloria had gotten up to go to the restroom and on her way back I intercepted her and as I took her in my arms I whispered, "Don't fight me on this, just go along" and I kissed her. I made it as passionate as I could and when I broke the kiss I whispered, "Look over my shoulder as you run your hand down my back and squeeze my ass. Do you recognize the man sitting at table three?" 

 She did as I asked and then said, "Yes, that is Brian Moser." 

 "Who is he?" 

 "He heads up the Clayton Foundation, why?" 

 "Pull yourself against me and act as if you are rubbing yourself against my cock." 

 She did it and she felt my erection. She gave me a strange look and said, "Did I do that?" 

 "You've done it for years lady, but that isn't what this is all about. Turn around and walk outside with me holding hands and I'll explain." 

 Once outside I told her about the bald headed guy and how he had been watching us. "And what he is seeing is me playing my part to the hilt to what appears to be a disinterested wife. If we are going to pull off this charade you are going to have to give me some help here. You are going to have to start acting like a loving and adoring wife when we are in public, at least until we get a year or two away from the wedding and honeymoon." 

 I unzipped myself and took out my cock. 

 "What are you doing? 

 I stroked my cock a few times while she watched and said, "I'm playing my part Gloria." I tucked my cock back in my pants so that the partial erection showed and left the fly unzipped. "I'm going to walk back in with you with my fly open and I want you to be adjusting your bra strap as you go through the door. Try and look like you just snuck away for a quickie with your hubby. I can almost guarantee baldy will have his eyes glued to the door as we go back in." 

 He was looking and I looked over at Gloria and saw that she noticed and it caused her to blush which was a nice touch. On the way home that night Gloria said, "Still think I'm a conspiracy nut?" 

 "I don't know Glory, it could be a coincidence." 

 She gave me a funny look. "Why did you call me that?" 

 "What?" 

 "Glory. You called me Glory." 

 "Just trying it out." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because we are madly in love and should have pet names for each other. After tonight I'm going to have to act more affectionate in public. Touch you more, gaze lovingly at you and make the people the people around us sick to their stomachs with all the lovey-dovey shit. Somehow sweetlips, babycakes and hot stuff don't seem to suit you while Glory does." 

 She was quiet for a while and then she said, "What did you mean when you said I'd been doing it for years?" 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "Your erection when you stopped me coming back from the john." 

 "Oh that." 

 "Yes, that. Just what did you mean?" 

 "Just that I, like every other guy who works at Stearns had the hots for you." 

 "Had, not have?" 

 "Get serious Gloria. You felt it, you know the answer to that." 

 The rest of the ride home was made in silence. 

 Jumal was waiting up for us when we got home. He and Gloria headed for the wet bar in the dining room and I headed for my room. I was just sliding under the covers when Jumal and Gloria walked into the room. 

 "Slide over Jack and make room for me and your wife. She wants her cunt licked and I want to watch you do it, but you know the rules." 

 Well, it was in the script as I had described it to Gloria way back when so I moved over and made room for them. Then I reached over to the nightstand and picked up the book that I had been reading, propped myself up and pretended to ignore them while reading. I did my best to hide the erection that seeing Gloria's naked body and hearing her moans gave me. When Jumal finished and pulled out he sneered at me and said, "All yours now hubby." I rolled over to keep my hard cock hidden and I went to work eating Gloria's pussy. The Gods were on my side that night and as I munched away on Gloria's cum muffin she had two loud orgasms - louder than the one orgasm she had when Jumal fucked her. When Gloria pushed me away, "Enough Jack, enough" I rolled over, picked up my book and pretended to read it until the two of them were gone. As soon as the door closed behind them I beat myself raw. 

 That night was the first and last time that Jumal fucked Gloria in front of me and it was also the first and last time he watched me eat her pussy. I guess his ego was too fragile for him to handle my giving Gloria bigger and more orgasms with my tongue than he gave her with his dick. What he didn't know and what I sure wasn't going to tell him was that it rarely happened. Like I said, the gods were on my side that night. 

 The next six months flew by with not much changing. I say not much, but there was a small change. Gloria made more trips to my room at night. It went from two or three times a week to five and sometimes six times and the visits themselves were just a tad different. Where before Gloria had come into the room and had then wakened me by playing with my cock until I was awake and then sitting on my face, now she stroked me until I woke up and then she kept stroking me for a while before moving up to be eaten. Then came the night that she kept stroking me until I came. She wiped her hand on my sheet and then sat on my face. After that night she jacked me off once or twice a week. Nothing was ever said, not then and not on the ride to work the next day. 

 Sally Ann was an insatiable slut and she kept me drained. A couple of times Gloria asked me if I wanted to get another girl from the book and I told her no. I wasn't sure, but I got the feeling that she thought that I might be having too much fun with Sally. I couldn't help but wonder if she might be just a touch jealous that her husband was having such a good time with another woman. 

 Our charade seemed to be working and almost everyone seemed to buy that we were a happily married and loving couple. I say almost everyone because I still saw Moser closely watching us. I had a bad feeling about him and the more I saw him the worse that feeling got. There was just something about him that set my teeth on edge. 

 And then one day I found out that my feelings were justified. 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** The Bought Husband Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© It started out as a series of, what were at the time, seemingly unconnected events. I went out of my way to avoid Jumal and Gloria when the three of us were in the house together, but sometimes you just can't avoid loud. It was on one of those rare nights when I was in the den playing Hearts on the computer. The den is just off the dinning room and Jumal and Gloria were sitting at the dinning room table and I don't believe that they knew I was in the den. 

 They were arguing and their voices grew louder and louder as they continued to argue. I didn't get it all, but the gist of it was that Jumal expected to be her second husband once I was out of the picture. Gloria on the other hand, did not see it that way. Her point being that the reasons she couldn't marry him in the first place would still be there even after I was gone. I think she shocked me just as much as she shocked Jumal when she stated that it just would not be socially acceptable for her to marry him. Where it went from there I have no idea because Jumal got up and stormed out of the house and I wasn't around when they next talked about it. 

 The second event happened a month later when I came home during lunch for a romp with Sally. After doing what she called her Hat Trick, my cumming at least once in her three available orifices, she said, "Jack, I love fucking you. I get a delicious turn on knowing that a man who knows my husband is fucking me on a regular basis, but you do know that I'm doing it for the money, right?" 

 "I'm shocked Sally Ann. I thought it was my manly charm and my ability as a stud." 

 She laughed, "That too. My point is that I'm in this for the money, not the love or lust. I'm not a stupid bimbo Jack and I know that there is more going on with this weird marriage of yours than you want people to know. The "can't have sex for medical reasons" is just so much bullshit because I've seen your wife and that obnoxious nigger going at it. Whatever is going on, it is obvious that you and your wife don't want people to know about it. We need to discuss this Jack and we need to talk money." 

 The next event took place three weeks later. I received a call from Brian Moser asking me to have lunch with him. He got right to the point. 

 "For some time now I have suspected that your marriage to Gloria Stearns is a sham. I have always believed that she paid you to be her husband in name only so she could cheat the various charities and foundations out of the money that her father intended then to have. Now I have positive information that this is true. I know that you have been paid two point five million to take part in this sham." 

 I started to say something but he cut me off. 

 "Don't bother trying to deny it because I wouldn't believe you anyway. The point is that I have enough proof to go to into court and show that Gloria Stearns is trying to defraud the Clayton Foundation and several other worthy charities. The purpose of this meeting is to get you on board." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "Oh come come Jack, you aren't stupid. My informant wants five million to testify to the scheme in court and while I personally believe that what he has to say is sufficient for my foundation to win I don't like taking chances. If I have you on the stand telling the story it would be a slam-dunk. I'd rather give you the five million and have a sure thing than give it to my informant and have an uncertain outcome." 

 "Let me see if I have this straight Mr. Moser. You will pay me five million dollars to get up on the witness stand and testify that my marriage to Gloria is phony?" 

 "That's it in a nutshell Jack." 

 "Well I'm sorry Mr. Moser, but that would be lying under oath and I can't do that. Sorry." I got up and left him sitting there. 

 Three weeks later Gloria was served papers. She was being sued by six foundations and three charities. 

 "Oh shit! What do I do now?" 

 "You get a good lawyer and you fight them. You take advantage of the of the time it takes a case to get to court and you use that time to get yourself pregnant." 

 "Pregnant? Good God, are you crazy. Get pregnant at a time like this?" 

 "What better time? You have to have a child to meet the terms of your fathers will anyway so do it now." 

 "But I didn't plan on having the baby until we got closer to the five years." 

 "Things change Glory." 

 "No Jack, no. It is out of the question." 

 "Think about it Glory. You have a completely valid marriage certificate following a wedding performed by an ordained minister and witnessed by over two hundred people. What you don't have is any way to prove that the marriage was ever consummated. They will contend in court that it is a marriage in name only, that you and I conspired to defraud those charities by having a phony marriage. They will not believe either one of us when we say that we have a marriage that is complete in all aspects including sex. If you are pregnant you take that argument away from them. The only thing that they can claim then is that the child is not mine and a DNA test will shoot that argument down." 

 "What you have to do is sit down, plot out your cycle and figure out when you are at your most fertile time and then for a week before and a week after we will fuck like bunnies. Only one thing. Don't let Jumal know what we are doing because I don't trust him not to try and interfere. It will be an ego thing with him. Maybe what we need to do is have you leave on a business trip of some sort and a day or two later I can meet you." 

 "God Jack, I don't know. I'm not ready. I knew I was going to have to do it, but I thought that I had lots of time yet." 

 "Well, it is your money Glory, at least until the trial." 

 It was stupid of me, but hey, it happens to almost everyone sooner or later. I fell in love. What was bad was that it was with my wife; the wife who was going to say goodbye to me when the five years were up. 

 Gloria decided that I was right and that she needed to move up her timetable for having a baby. She also agreed with me that it would be wise not to let Jumal know. The reason I gave her (his ego) for keeping him in the dark wasn't my real reason, but Gloria didn't know that and what's more, I couldn't let her find out the real reason. Gloria told Jumal that she had to go to Denver for business and would be gone for five days. The next day she caught a flight for Palm Springs. I waited a day and then I left for a business trip to Atlanta where I caught a flight the Springs. 

 The next six days were spent lying beside a pool and taking the sun during the day and enjoying the Palm Springs nightlife at night. And of course there was the sex. We made love on the average of five times a day. I knew that the sex, as enjoyable as it was and as much as Gloria seemed to enjoy it, was for the sole purpose of having the baby she needed to meet the terms of her father's will. And I also knew that she felt guilty that she was doing it behind Jumal's back. 

 Still, even knowing all that, I found that she could be passionate, inventive, and at times insatiable. She never got tired of my eating her pussy and always wanted me to start out our lovemaking sessions by doing it. She went crazy when I ate her after cumming in her; something that I had been reluctant to do until she pointed out that the stuff I could get to wasn't going to go any farther into her anyway. She was smart, beautiful, and witty and by the end of our time alone with each other she owned me, body and soul. 

 Six days is all Gloria could arrange to be away from work and so our sexual meetings had to take place after we got back home. To keep Jumal in the dark as to what we were doing, even thought it tore Gloria up to do it, we fucked on either her desk or mine at work after everyone else had gone home and we did it every day right up to the day she told me that she was pregnant. 

 That news triggered the one thing that I knew would make her hate me forever. I remembered her telling me that by the end of the five years I might have grown to hate the very sight of her, but I had never suspected that it would be the other way round. What I did I did for her, but I could not tell her that or why I did it, at least not then. The night after she told me she was pregnant I walked into her office at quitting time with a bottle of champagne and two glasses. I popped the cork and filled the two glasses and handed Gloria one of them. 

 "Here is a toast to the mother to be and to a healthy child." 

 We clicked glasses and then we sat there and sipped the bubbly until the bottle was empty and then I called for the limo and we left the office. By the time I helped her in the car the Special K had taken effect and Gloria was almost out of it. 

 "Here Glory, drink this, it will make you feel better" and I helped her drink the glass of water with the tab of Ecstasy in it. I told Mack, our chauffeur, to drop us at the downtown Hilton and then to take the rest of the night off. I got Gloria on the elevator and up to the seventh floor and when I knocked on the door it was opened by a tall good-looking black man. Dave and I had been frat brothers in college and I had arranged with him to do me this special favor. 

 For the next five hours I walked around taking pictures with a digital camera and shooting video as Dave and five of his friends fucked the living shit out of my wife. They used her every way that six men could use a woman and I got more than a dozen pictures of her with three men in her at one time. By the end of the second hour Gloria was begging and pleading with the men to fuck her and she was sucking cocks as fast as they went limp to get them back up again. At the end of the five hours the only man in the room that still had a hard cock was me. None of the other six could get it up again no matter how much Gloria begged, pleaded or worked with her hands and mouth to make it happen. 

 As Dave left he said, "I hope it works out for you bud. I know you told me why and I know you only expect it to happen the once, but if the lady has developed a taste for it, don't forget me." 

 Gloria was crying and whining as the six men left and she crawled across the floor to me and tried to pull my zipper down, but I pushed her away. I had the hard on of all hard ons and I wanted to make love - not fuck, but make love - to Gloria in the worst way, but I couldn't. I just couldn't do it because as stupid as it may have sounded, it wouldn't have been right. I pulled Gloria over to the bed and I lay down and pulled her close to me and held her tightly until she fell asleep. 

 I woke up in pain. As soon as I was awake I saw Gloria swinging a table lamp at me and from the way I felt she had already connected with it several times. I rolled away from her and got off the bed and when she followed me and swung again I caught her arms and wrestled the table lamp away from her. I didn't bother to ask her why she was doing what she was doing because I already knew and I knew that from her standpoint I deserved it. As I held her she kicked and screamed at me and one of her knees caught my nut sack and I fell back onto the bed. I had both hands covering the jewels and I was wincing in pain when she went over to her purse and got out something. She came back, climbed on the bed and sat on me. 

 "You rotten mother fucking bastard. It is there because of you you miserable cock sucker so you better get all of it out" and then she spun around into a sixty-nine position, grabbed my cock and I felt something cold against it. She sat down on my face and shoved her cum filled pussy right up against my mouth. "You better get every last drop out of me you bastard or I will saw your cock off" and I felt cold steel against my dick. 

 I fought off the nausea caused by the shot to my balls and went after Gloria's cunt like my life depended on my doing what she wanted which, of course, it did. I was so into saving my cock that I don't even know when it was that her hands let go of my dick and she started wailing and having orgasms, but I eventually became aware that I seemed to be out of danger. By then the guilt I had felt over doing to her what I had done took over and I considered that getting every drop of cum out of Gloria would be partial penance. I stayed after her pussy until she feel back on the bed exhausted from the strength of her orgasms. 

 I quickly got off the bed, dressed and got out of the room and went down to the lobby and caught a cab. I had it take me cross-town to another hotel where I checked in for a two-day stay and then I went to the room and fell asleep. It was a Saturday so I had two days before I had to go to work and face Gloria. Two days to plan on what to say to her without really saying anything to her at all. I couldn't tell her why I had done it; there just wasn't anyway I would be able to convince her of the truth - that I had done it for her - without telling her why it was for her benefit. She just couldn't know, at least not yet. 

 I was spared having to talk with Gloria on Monday. She didn't come to work and she didn't ask to speak to me when she called in. I figured that the best thing for me to do was stay in my hotel room for a couple of more days and that night, after work, I went back and registered for two more days. The next morning Gloria called me in her office. 

 "Where have you been?" 

 "Staying a hotel." 

 "That won't do. With the court case coming up now more than ever we must keep up appearances. I shudder to think of what the opposition would make of your staying in a hotel if they found out. I can't stand the sight of you, but I need you to be around me. We will try and act like the loving couple that we are supposed to be. When we are alone just stay out of my way and stay out of my sight." 

 Under the circumstances I didn't feel comfortable being in the house. With the exception of going home for lunch and letting Sally Ann fuck me silly I stayed away as much as I could. I took up activities that would keep me out of the house. I joined clubs, took up bowling and signed up to bowl in three leagues. I was gone so often the Gloria called me into her office and complained. 

 "You aren't living up to your end of the bargain Jack. I need you to be seen in public with me. It doesn't look right for me to show up at a charity dinner alone because you are off somewhere bowling or some such thing." 

 "Our deal didn't say anything about my not having a life until after our divorce Gloria" 

 "That isn't the point Jack. I need you with me so that there won't be any doubts raised." 

 "When we are in public I am loving and attentive and your swelling belly attests to the fact that we are a loving couple." 

 She stared at me for a minute and then she said, "What went wrong Jack? What poisoned you against me? What made you do that despicable thing that you did to me?" 

 "You'll know soon enough Gloria. You won't like it, but you will know." 

 I'd been expecting it so the shock on Gloria's face when Jumal got up on the witness stand and blew the whistle on Gloria's plan didn't surprise me. 

 "That bastard! He slept in my bed last night and he does this to me today? I thought he loved me." 

 "You never should have told him that you weren't going to marry him after you divorced me." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "If you didn't marry him he couldn't get access to your money so he decided to settle for the five million that Moser offered him" 

 "What? What the hell are you talking about?" 

 "Oh grow up Gloria. The love of your life just sold you down the river. You think he did it because he saw it as his civic duty? He got paid Gloria, or he thinks he is getting paid. If Moser made Jumal the same deal he offered me Jumal is expecting five million dollars for his testimony, but I don't think he is smart enough to know that Moser is going to stiff him if the foundation doesn't win." 

 "What deal? What the hell is going on here Jack?" 

 "Just be patient Gloria, you'll see." 

 Gloria's lawyer got up to cross-examine Jumal. "Mr. Washington, are you being paid for your testimony here today?" 

 "No, of course not." 

 "You are telling me that you are not being paid five million dollars to sit on this stand and tell this story? Think very carefully before you answer Mr. Washington. You are under oath and there are severe penalties for perjury." 

 Jumal was starting to sweat. How could the lawyer know the exact amount? He looked over at the table where Moser and his lawyers were sitting. 

 "Come now Mr. Washington, no need to look over to that table for guidance, yes or no, are you being paid five million dollars for your testimony?" 

 There were a bunch of objections, but the judge told Jumal to answer the question so he did and being Jumal he lied, "No I am not." 

 Next came a bunch of people who testified about the will, it's provisions, what they believed the intentions of Gloria's father to be and things along those lines. We broke for lunch and as I ate mine Gloria fidgeted and poked at her salad. 

 "How can you eat at a time like this? I thought what you did to me was bad enough, but this, this is just unbelievable. That bastard sold me out. I'm toast." 

 "It ain't over until the fat lady sings Gloria." 

 "Oh bullshit Jack. My whole world is going to disappear and you just sit around saying don't worry, be happy." 

 "Okay, you win, life as you know it is over. Which, by the way is true, life as you knew it is over, but that doesn't mean that the life you will have left will be without your money." 

 "Just what the hell does that mean Jack?" 

 "It doesn't matter what we do to defuse Jumal's testimony, the fact still remains that he was your lover and he can tell enough that people will be able to check on things and verify some of it. You are a cheating wife. Your social circle will know that you had a nigger for a lover. You have been unfaithful to your husband and all of that is going to be public knowledge after this trial whether you win or lose. So yes Gloria, life as you knew it is over. Your real friends will rally around you and the ones that aren't worth a shit will avoid you like the plague. The best thing for you to do now is get your chin up, hold your head up high and get on with it." 

 Court reconvened and it was our turn. Our lawyer called witnesses who testified as being present at our wedding. The minister was called and verified that he was ordained and authorized to perform marriages in our state and that he had performed ours after being given a copy of a legitimate marriage license. The next witness called was me. 

 "Only a few questions for you Mr. Stanton. Is your marriage to Gloria Sterns a sham?" 

 "Absolutely not." 

 "You are not merely a husband in name only? You do in fact perform your husbandly duties?" 

 "Yes I do. You may notice that my wife is seven months pregnant." 

 "Yes I have noticed that and so I will ask you the question that the plaintiff's lawyer is sure to ask. Are you sure that the child that Mrs. Stanton is carrying is yours?" 

 "Easy enough to check in this day and age, what with DNA tests available, but yes, I am sure that the child is mine." 

 "One last question Mr. Stanton. Do you love your wife?" 

 "Yes I do." 

 Then it was Moser's lawyers turn. "Mr. Stanton, I'll be brief. You have testified that you love your wife. You can say that even though Mr. Washington has been on the stand and testified to having a long standing affair with her?" 

 "Yes I can." 

 "Frankly Mr. Stanton, you will have to forgive my saying that I don't believe you and if I don't believe you how can you expect the other members of this court to believe you?" 

 "Neither you or any other member of this court knows the reason for my wife's infidelity. Mr. Washington was blackmailing her and I expect that Mr. Moser and his foundation had a hand in it. I won't say that things are perfect between us right now, but I expect that we will work things out."  

 

 ****** The Bought Husband Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© There was an uproar and a lot of gavel pounding before things settled down. The lawyers were called to the bench for a side bar and when it was over Moser's lawyer came back to me. 

 "Mr. Stanton, you are aware that false statements can lead to civil penalties are you not?" 

 "I am" 

 "You have just accused Mr. Moser and his foundation of possibly taking part in an illegal act. Knowing that there are penalties for making those kinds of false statements would you like to retract that statement?" 

 "No, of course not. I do not believe that it is a coincidence that Mr. Washington was blackmailing my wife for something that happened at a Clayton Foundation dinner and that he is here now testifying on behalf of the Clayton Foundation. I believe that what happened at that dinner was a set up and I believe that officers of that foundation, of which Mr. Moser is one, had a hand in it." 

 "And would you like to explain to this court just how The Clayton Foundation had a hand in this so called blackmail scheme?" 

 "My wife attended one of their social functions and someone slipped date rape drugs in her drink. Sometime during the evening she was photographed in several sexually compromising positions and two weeks after the affair Mr. Washington showed up with the photos and began making demands. Because of my wife's social position she did not feel that she could let those photos become public so she foolishly gave into Mr. Washington's demands which, unfortunately, included a demand for sexual favors as well as money. Unfortunately I knew none of this until Mr. Washington took the stand. My wife confessed and explained what had happened to me at lunch today." 

 "But you have no proof of this do you?" 

 "No, I don't, at least not tying the foundation to it, but I do have the photos that Mr. Washington gave my wife when he approached her to blackmail her." 

 "All right, let us move to something else. Have you been paid to be your wife's husband?" 

 "Define the word "paid." 

 "Very well. Are you getting something for being your wife's husband?" 

 "Yes I am." 

 "Frankly sir, I never expected you to admit it. Would you please tell the court what you receive for being her husband?" 

 "Smiles, hugs and kisses, love and affection, companionship and she spoils me rotten. 

 "Very clever Mr. Stanton. Have you not been paid two and a half million dollars to be her husband for five years?" 

 "I have not." 

 "What would you say if I told you I have proof that it is in fact true?" 

 "I would say that you manufactured that proof at the same time that you paid Mr. Washington five million to get on the witness stand and perjure himself. What is more, I have proof. Well, actually it is indirect proof, but proof to any thinking person just the same." 

 "I don't believe that I have ever heard of the concept of indirect proof. What pray tell might that be?" 

 "I'll answer your question with a question. If you had 2 and a half million in your left hand and five million in your right and you were told you could have one or the other, which one would you take?" 

 "The five of course. Any sane person who make that choice." 

 "So, if I had been paid two and a half million to be a phony husband I would have to had been either stupid or insane to turn down the five million Brian Moser offered me to get on the stand and say that my marriage was a fake, now wouldn't I?" 

 There was a lot of yelling, gavel pounding, finger pointing and threats of being sued until I produced the tape I had made of my meeting with Moser. Gloria won hands down and the judge told Moser that he was going to recommend to the District Attorney that Moser be tried for a half a dozen different charges. Unfortunately the tapes didn't give a name to the informant that Moser referred to even though everyone knew it had to be Jumal so, since there was no proof, he skated on the deal. 

 The ride home was silent until we were almost in the driveway. Gloria had stared at me most of the way home and finally she said, "The blackmail photos that you said you had were the ones from that night weren't they?" 

 "Yes." 

 "You knew that far ahead of time what Jumal was going to do?" 

 "Yes I did. I knew that I had to have a way to diffuse his testimony about your continued affair with him and that it had to be real enough to pass examination if it had to be produced in court. The only way to make it real enough was to make it real." 

 "But how did you know?" 

 "You owe Sally Ann big time for that and I did tell her that you would see to it that she got a large bonus when the dust settled." 

 I told her how Sally Ann had found out about how the medical story was bogus, how she had overheard Jumal on the telephone offering to sell us out for a price and I told her about being in the den when she and Jumal had the argument. 

 "I put them all together and when Moser called me and asked me to have lunch with him I knew what was happening and I wore a tape recorder to the meeting to see if I could get him to commit on tape." 

 "Why didn't you tell me Jack? Why did you let me suffer all these months thinking that I was going to lose everything?" 

 "I didn't trust you Glory." 

 "You didn't trust me? Just what the fuck does that mean?" 

 "I put that poorly. What I meant is that I did not trust you not to act like a love-sick female." 

 "You keep digging your hole deeper Jack. Just what does that mean?" 

 "It means that I knew Jumal was selling you out and I remembered our first dinner together on the night you offered me the deal. Your exact words were, "Love is blind Jack. I adore him. It doesn't matter what he does I'll find excuses for him." If I told you what I knew you would have said, "Bullshit Jack" and you would have run to him with my "ridiculous" story. He would have called Moser and they would have known that we were on to them. The only way my tape was going to work was if they never saw it coming." 

 "You could have at least shared it with our lawyer." 

 "He is your lawyer Glory, not mine, and the same thing that I didn't want to happen would have happened. I tell him. He discuses it with you, you confront me and then run to Jumal." 

 She stared at me in silence for several moments and then said, "Why did you do it Jack? Why did you pass on five million just to two and a half?" 

 "You still don't get it do you Glory? As bright as you are and as good a businessperson as you are and you still don't get it. I would have thought that your father would have passed it on to you in his genes. Think on it Glory; think on it and see what you come up with. I'm going to bed now. We need to get up early tomorrow. This court thing has kept us away from the office for too long and the work is piling up. Goodnight." 

 As I walked toward my room she called out, "Jack." I turned and she said, "Thank you Jack, thank you for everything." I smiled at her, turned and went to my room. 

 I was surprised when about two hours later Gloria came into my room. Mostly I was surprised because she didn't wake me up by stroking my cock like she usually did. This time she woke me up with a blow job. When she had me awake she said, "I'm keyed up. I need to take the edge off. I don't have anything in me this time, but you think you could see your way clear to eat me anyway?" 

 "Yeah, I think that I could do that." 

 I went to work on her and I went slow and easy so she could relax, but she really didn't want to relax - to take the edge off - and her hands dug into my hair and she pulled me to her and started to moan. It began as a low hiss, "Yesyesyesyesssssss" and rose to an "oh god oh god oh god" and then became a "fuck me fuck me fuck me, oh god please fuck me." I did, but it was awkward for me at first. Once we knew Gloria was pregnant we stopped having sex so I had never made love to her with her big belly. I finally figured out what to do and I got the job done and then Gloria surprised me again - she laid down next to me, snuggled up and went to sleep. 

 When I woke up in the morning Gloria was awake, lying on her side, leaning on an elbow and looking down at me while she stroked my cock. 

 "What's going on?" I asked. 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Last night I get head, pussy and a partner to snuggle up to and this morning, unless I'm greatly mistaken, I'm going to get laid again." 

 "A girl gets horny when she's knocked up. You just happen to have the equipment needed to take care of the problem." 

 I couldn't resist; I just had to say it, "You seem to have gotten over Jumal pretty quick. I expected you to take to your room and cry your eyes out for a week." 

 "I probably would have if he had left me for another woman or if I had come home and found him in bed with Sally Ann. But the cold way it happened, in my bed making love to me and not eight hours later he's in court shooting me through the grease tended to kill things quickly. Oh look, I think he's ready to play. You are going to play, aren't you?" 

 "You are one of a kind Jack, when they made you they broke the mold." 

 We were in the car on the way to work when she said that. 

 "How so?" 

 "I thought about what you said and I finally figured it out. Loyalty. That and the fact that you gave your word. Honesty and truthfulness are the watch words, right Jack?" 

 All I could do was shrug my shoulders." 

 "Anyone else would have taken the five million and run with it. What I don't understand is how you can be that way and then lie under oath in court." 

 "I didn't lie in court." 

 "Sure you did. The man flat out asked you if you had been paid two and a half million to pretend to be my husband and you said no." 

 "That wasn't a lie." 

 "Sure it was." 

 "No Gloria, it wasn't. We were in a court of law and in court a word means just what it means. His question was "have you been paid." I don't get the money until the five years is up. If his question had been "Are you going to be paid" and I answered no then I would have been lying." 

 She was silent for several miles and then she said, "What about the other?" 

 "What other?" 

 "Do you love your wife" was as direct a question as you could get and you said yes." 

 "I did, didn't I." 

 "Well?" 

 "Well what?" 

 "That was a lie." 

 I looked at her for several seconds and then I turned and looked out the window as I said, "No, no it wasn't." 

 She stared at me for several very long moments and then in almost a whisper, "Oh. Oh Sweet Jesus." 

 The work had piled up while I had been spending time on our court case and the day went quickly as I dug into it. Gloria had her plate full too and we worked through lunch and we didn't talk again until the ride home that night. We were no sooner in the limo than she put the divider up and said, "You said you loved me. How can you square that against what you had done to me in that hotel room." 

 "Tina Turner has a song about that. It's called "What's Love Got To Do With It." 

 "Must you always speak in riddles Jack? Can't you just give me a straight answer for a change?" 

 "Not a riddle Gloria. You didn't hire me to love you. You hired me to see to it that you got thirty-one million dollars. Five hours in a hotel room with six guys was a small price to pay for such a large return on investment, especially since you so obviously had a good time. Fortunately we didn't have to use those photos in court to smear Jumal, but I had to be ready just in case." 

 She was quiet almost all the rest of the way home and as we pulled into the drive she said, "What are you going to do about Sally Ann?" 

 "I don't know. Now that she knows all about the arrangement you had with Jumal I suppose I can start having her over in the evenings if she can get away. That way I won't have to miss so much work. Why?" 

 "We really don't need her anymore." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Well for one thing I've already told you how horny that being pregnant makes me and you did say in court that you handle your husbandly duties." 

 "Are you asking me to be your real husband?" 

 "You are my real husband Jack. The paperwork isn't fake and neither was the wedding ceremony. I am legally Gloria Marcella Stanton and all I'm saying is that it is time for me for me to be a proper wife to you." 

 "What happens after the baby arrives and all those scrambled hormones that are making you horny level out?" 

 "It won't change anything Jack, we will still be married." 

 "What happens at the end of the five years?" 

 "That will be your choice Jack." 

 "You sure about this?" 

 "Never been more sure of anything in my life. I have an honest to god Knight in Shining Armor and I'd be a fool to let him get away." 

 "Okay. We will settle up with Sally Ann and give her a nice bonus for alerting us to what was coming and then I guess we will just see what happens." 

 "You want me to move to your room or will you move to mine?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Men sometimes have ego problems Jack. Can you handle sleeping in the bed where I spent so much time with Jumal?" 

 "Look at it as my claiming my territory after driving him from it." 

 "Oh Jack, you are such a romantic." Report_Story
