 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She sat at her desk and read the memo that she found lying in the middle of her desk when she came in that morning. The information it contained was disturbing and she frowned. She had promised her husband that she would free her schedule so the two of them could take a four day weekend and sneak off and be alone. The arrangements were made. Jake had made the reservations at the resort hotel and all was ready. 

 The memo in her hand said she was scheduled for a 4 PM meeting on Friday, the day she was supposed to be leaving. She and Jake had planned to be on the road by 8 AM Friday morning, but someone had committed her to a meeting on a day she was supposed to be off. She picked up the phone and buzzed Marci. Marci was Dan's secretary and Dan was the general manager of the hotel that employed her. 

 "Marci? This is Fran. I found a memo on my desk when I got here this morning and I see that I'm set up for a 4 PM meeting with Daimler/Parsons tomorrow. What is going on? I'm supposed to be off tomorrow. Jake and I are taking a four day weekend end to go SCUBA diving." 

 "All I know honey is that Dan told me to schedule you for the meeting." 

 "Put me through to him please." 

 "No can do honey, he is in a very important meeting right now." 

 "I need to talk with him ASAP Marci. Jake will not be happy if I cancel this weekend on him. It will be the fourth or fifth time in the last six months that my job has gotten in the way of our plans." 

 "Not to worry honey, about talking to Dan I mean. I'm sure that he will be calling you as soon as his meeting is over. The meeting is with Brian Daimler and I'm certain that Dan will talk to you about what has been said." 

 Daimler she thought, that's the name of who she was scheduled to meet with at 4 PM the next day. "Okay Marci, I'll sit by the phone and wait for his call." 

 She hung up the phone and turned to her computer and Googled Brian Daimler. The information she found gave her a sinking feeling. President and CEO of Amalgamated Industries and on the board of directors of five other corporations, one of which was the corporation that owned the luxury hotel where she was employed as an events coordinator. As important as he was there was no way she would be able to skip that 4 PM meeting, not if she planned on keeping her job. 

 She cleared her screen and did a LexisNexis search and discovered that he was engaged to be married to an Estelle Parsons and it all became clear. She was the hotel's events coordinator and part of her job was planning and coordinating weddings and that she was suddenly set up for a meeting with Daimler and Parsons meant that she was suddenly between a rock and a hard place. To pass on the Daimler/Parsons meeting would please Jake, but probably cost her her job. Take the meeting and Jake would not be happy. He was already upset over how many times her job had gotten in the way of their personal life. The phone rang and it was Marci telling her that Dan wanted to see her in his office. 

 She entered Dan's office and he told her to take a seat. "Fran, do you know who Brian Daimler is?" 

 "Yes sir. I know he is on the board of directors of the corporation that owns this hotel." 

 "Well, he has decided that his wedding and reception will be held here at the hotel. I've scheduled you to meet with him and his intended tomorrow at 4PM. This wedding could very well be the 'social event' of the year and it is important that we shine. I know it will put a lot of pressure on you, but I am confidant that you can handle it. It goes without saying that I will see to it that you have whatever you need. Any questions?" 

 "Yes sir. I'm not scheduled to work tomorrow. My husband and I are going off on a four day weekend and I won't be back to work until Tuesday." 

 "I'm afraid that you will have to cancel your plans. Tomorrow is the only day that Mr. Daimler has available. I'm sure that your husband will understand and I will make it up to you. Tell him I will see to it that we comp you for a weeks stay at our hotel in Cabo San Lucas once the Daimler/Parsons wedding is out of the way." 

 She knew that trying to talk her way out of the meeting was useless so she just stood up, said "Yes sir" and left his office. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 "You what?" her husband asked. 

 "I have to attend a meeting tomorrow at four." 

 "How are you going to do that? We will be over a hundred miles away." 

 "I have to make this meeting honey. If I don't make it I could lose my job." 

 "Your job is more important than our relationship? Your job is more important than spending time with me?" 

 "No baby, but..." 

 "No buts Fran. You have let that job interfere with the last five times I've set up something for us to do. I don't give a rat's ass if you do lose it. You don't need it anyway. I make more than enough to take care of us. We don't need the money that the job pays you. The only reason you work is to give you something to do. If you have to have something to do then get another job." 

 "Be reasonable honey. It is a good job, I like doing it and I'm good at it." 

 "I don't care Fran. I'm sick of having a job you don't need screwing up our plans." 

 "Dan said he would make it up to us. He is going to comp us for a full week at the hotel in Cabo." 

 "Fran, I made plans for this weekend and I'm not going to change them. I'm going. You can either go with me or not, but I am going. And I'll say one more thing while I'm at it. Your job will never again get in the way of any plans I make. If I schedule it, it will happen; with you or with out you, it will happen." 

 He got up from the table and said, "I'm going to pack" and he walked out of the room. As she watched him walk away she wondered if the job was worth getting in arguments over. She loved the work and she had a flair for it. Okay, so it did get in the way of Jake's plans every once in a while, but so what? It wasn't as if it happened all the time. Granted, it did happen several times in the last five months, but that was an abnormality. Prior to those occurrences they had gone a year and a half with out her job being a problem at all. 

 She suspected that Jake's animosity toward her job was based on some macho idea that as the man of the house a working wife was an insult to his ability to provide for his family. Well that was just too bad. She was not going to sit at home with nothing to do but watch inane daytime television. And if she was going to work it was going to be at something she liked and was good at and that just happened to be the job that she already had. 

 It was still dark out when Jake's moving around woke her up. She glanced at the bedside clock and saw that it was only 5 AM. She sat up in bed and watched him dress. 

 "Why are you up so early?" 

 "Since I'm going alone I decided to get an early start. If you have changed your mind I'll wait while you get dressed and pack." 

 "I haven't changed my mind. I have to make that meeting." 

 "Okay then, I'll see you late Monday or early Tuesday" and he turned and left the bedroom without even offering to kiss her good-bye. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She had cleared her desk in anticipation of being off that day and she really had nothing to do until her meeting at four, but she didn't want to sit at home and stare at the walls so she went into work. She was sitting at her computer checking her e-mails when the phone rang. It was Marci telling her she was wanted in Dan's office. 

 "A little late perhaps, but some good news, at least for you. Miss Parsons has had a death in the family and has to fly to Kansas City so this afternoon's meeting is going to have to be rescheduled. You get your weekend after all." 

 As she left his office she looked at her watch and saw that it was five after nine. Her SCUBA gear was already in the trunk of the car and it wouldn't take her anymore than thirty minutes to drive home and pack. She could be on the road by ten and at the beach by noon. She would still be able to get in almost a full day of diving and maybe a hot evening in the sack with Jake would smooth things over between them. 

 She made good time and got there at a quarter to twelve. One of her tanks was empty so she pulled up at the dive shop to get the tank filled before going to the hotel. While she was waiting for her tank she glanced out the back window at the beach and she saw Jake. He was not alone. He was helping a good looking blonde with the straps on her tank harness and from the way he was looking at her it was clear that he was trying to get something going. She turned and headed for the door intending to go out and put a stop to what she thought was happening, but she stopped as her hand touched the door and as bad thoughts flooded her mind. Jake hadn't been gone from her seven hours. Allowing for the two hour drive he had only been there five hours and he was already working on having a playmate? 

 She thought back on the dozen or so business trips he had gone on over the last few years and wondered how he spent the nights. Alone in his hotel room or had he found playmates then also? She decided that she was not going to let Jake know that she was there and she was going to watch and see what he did. 

 Once her tank was filled she moved her car away from the dive shop so it wouldn't be noticed if Jake should happen to need something from the shop. She grabbed her beach blanket from the trunk, got her 7 X 15 binoculars and an old floppy hat out of her duffle bag and went out on the beach. She spread her blanket out and sat down on it just in time to see Jake and the blond wade out into the water. She debated putting on her gear and following them, but at the last second she decided that she didn't want to chance Jake knowing that she was around. 

 It was an hour before she saw Jake and the blond woman again. They came out of the water and removed their fins and walked to a blanket and picnic cooler under a beach umbrella. They dropped their weight belts and helped each other get their tanks off and then they sat down on the blanket. She was far enough away from them not to be noticed and there were a dozen other people on the beach with binoculars who were looking in all directions so her looking their way wouldn't draw attention. 

 She watched as Jake and the woman talked, spread sun-screen over each other and talked some more. She was watching when Jake bent down and kissed the woman and she was watching when the woman's arms went around Jake's neck and she returned the kiss. The two of them fell back on the blanket and began to do some serious necking. 

 She had seen enough. It didn't take the brain of a rocket scientist to know if Jake and the woman had reached that point that early in the day what would happen that evening was a forgone conclusion. Tears were streaking her cheeks as she got up and headed for her car. That bastard! How could he! 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The drive home gave her a lot of time to think about her situation. Nine years of marriage and it meant nothing to Jake. What did it mean to her? It meant nine years of taking care of Jake; nine years of being a loving and faithful wife to a man who turned out to be a worthless asshole. 

 By the time she was halfway home she was making lists in her mind of what she needed to do when she divorced his sorry ass. It wasn't until she was pulling into her driveway that she had an epiphany. The sorry bastard had been cheating on her and what she needed was to get even. Well, probably not even because she had no way of knowing how many bimbos the bastard had slept with during their nine year marriage, but she could get back at him. Why give up her home and her comfortable existence just because Jake was a cheating asshole. No. She would continue to let him pay the bills and she would maintain the facade of a good marriage, but even though he would never know, she was going to pay him back in kind. 

 As she walked into the house she was still making a list in her mind, only now it was a list of the men she was going to give herself to. She was sitting in the kitchen drinking a beer and working on her list of about to be fuck-buddies when suddenly she knew she couldn't do it. She was making a list of men she knew and found attractive, but almost all of them also knew Jake. Sooner or later one of them would let something slip and word could get back to Jake and she didn't want that. She wanted Jake to continue thinking that she was a loving and devoted wife while she was busy hanging horns on him. She wanted Jake to support her and take care of her while she fucked around on him. The men she spread for would have to be strangers. 

 She wadded up her list and tossed it in the trash. She finished her beer and then headed for the shower. She had three nights alone, courtesy of Jake, and she saw no reason for not getting started on her revenge. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 "Oh God yes!" she screamed, "Yes baby, yes" as she had her seventh orgasm of the night and maybe her twenty-fifth since Friday. The man - Barry, Barney, Benny or some such name like that - pounded his cock into her as she screamed, cried and begged. Her arms and legs gripped him tight to her as he finally pushed his third load of the night into her hot, wet and hungry pussy. He pulled out and fell to the bed next to her and she rolled over and slid down to take his limp cock in her mouth. After three or four minutes she gave up trying to get him up again. 

 Maybe in a couple of hours he would recover enough to go again, but she couldn't give him a couple of hours; she needed to get dressed and get home. As she drove home she thought back over the last three days. Friday she had gone to a lounge on the other side of town. She actually felt the eyes on her as she walked through the door in her little black dress and four inch heels and made her way to an empty stool at the bar. She ordered a drink and when the bartender brought it he waved away her attempt to pay and pointed to a man sitting at the end of the bar and said that her drink had been taken care of. She raised her glass to the man in salute and after that it was one man after another asking her to dance. 

 She had nursed her drink; she didn't want to get drunk, just loose enough to really enjoy it when she finally chose the lucky guy. Three hours later she was in a motel with her legs up on the shoulders of a man whose name she had already forgotten. She had fucked him and sucked him off and on for almost six hours while listening to her cell phone chime as Jake tried to reach her. In the morning she had left the man lying on the motel bed, spent and exhausted, and had gone on home. The answering machine had five calls from Jake on it and she deleted them all without listening to them. 

 Saturday night had been a repeat - different lounge, different motel, but with the same result. She had left another exhausted man on a motel bed and she had again ignored Jake's attempts to reach her. 

 That night's conquest had been different. She and what's his name had gotten out of their cars at the same time in the parking lot and on the way to the door he had asked her to save him a dance when they got inside. She had stopped and looked at him for a second and then she had said: 

 "If you are here for the same reason I am why even bother going inside?" 

 Twenty minutes later she was on her knees in a motel room and sucking his cock while he was removing his shirt. As she was leaving the motel room he had asked her when they could do it again and she told him the same thing she had told the two before him: 

 "Sorry, this was a one time only thing. It was great and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but we won't ever do it again." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When she got home she ran herself a hot bath and soaked in it for a while. As the heat warmed her body she thought that it was too bad that she hadn't found out about Jake sooner. She enjoyed getting strange cock and if the weekend was any indication, the more she got, the more she was going to want. When she got out of the tub she douched herself real good. She wasn't worried about pregnancy; she was on birth control pills and she also had a diaphragm in place, but on the off chance that Jake wanted to have sex when he got home she didn't want him sliding in someone else's soup. It would be great revenge to give him sloppy seconds or have him eat her with someone else's junk inside her, but what if he noticed? No, she had to keep it clean. 

 She noticed that she had already in her mind changed the act of intercourse from 'making love' to 'having sex'. She wouldn't deny Jake sex when he wanted it, but she would never again be the one to initiate it. She wondered if he would notice the lack of "real" passion. She would fake it, but real passion was something that Jake would never see from her again. 

 She put on some sweats and got busy cleaning house and doing laundry. As she worked she wondered if the fact that Jake hadn't been able to reach her all weekend would cause him to come home early that night or whether he would not be home until Tuesday morning. Because he might come home early she was going to have to pass on going out hunting even though she wanted to. 

 Those thoughts prompted another. She was going to have to find some other way to get strange cock. She couldn't lounge shop with Jake at home; that is what she would do when he was on his business trips, but she was going to have to find some way to get fucked while he was around. She thought about that most of the day while she worked, but it wasn't until she was laying out the clothes she was going to wear to work the next day that the idea occurred to her. She rolled it over in her mind and then she decided. She was going to start a tradition. She would make it her goal to bed a member of the wedding party of every wedding she worked on as the events coordinator. 

 She averaged one wedding a week and some weeks she did as many as three. She would try to limit it to a specific list; fathers of the bride and groom, the best man and the ushers. She giggled as she thought she'd better take a pass on the ring bearer if she wanted to stay out of jail, but the rest of them would be fair game. Hell, she might even try for the groom. Only as a last resort would she go after a guest at the wedding. If she could pull it off it would hold her until Jake went on a business trip. He averaged one a month and was usually gone three or four days. 

 She made a mental note to buy a small note book to keep track of how many men she was going to let put horns on her husband. No names, no dates, nothing specific, just a check mark so she could keep count. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Jake got home at nine that night. She was in the kitchen and when he came in he walked up to her and took her in his arms and tried to kiss her, but she turned her head away. He stepped back and looked at her: 

 "What's that all about? You aren't glad to see me?" 

 "What it is about asshole, is that you walked out of here Friday morning and didn't even attempt to kiss me good-bye so I'm damned sure not going to give you a kiss to welcome you home." 

 "I'm sorry baby, but I was upset over you not going with me." 

 "Not near as upset as I am over your attitude." 

 "Is that why you didn't take any of my calls over the weekend? 

 "Yes it is. If I had taken any one of those calls it would have turned into a shouting match before it was over and I was already pissed off enough. I didn't need any more shit to have to carry through the weekend." 

 "Let's go into the bedroom and I'll make things up to you." 

 "No." 

 "Come on baby, don't be like that. Why don't you go slip into something slinky and sexy while I take a quick shower."  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Slinky and sexy huh?" 

 "Naked will work; I'm easy to get along with." 

 She thought, "Don't I know it asshole; I saw just how easy you are to get along with through the dive shop window." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was already naked and under the sheets we he came into the bedroom. Normally they started their love making with some necking and then some sixty- nine, but that night she was going to let him do all the work. She would make the appropriate noises and probably get into it when he started fucking her, but she wasn't going to help. 

 It went pretty much as she had expected. He played with her tits and rubbed her pussy, but when he tried to swing into a sixty-nine she wouldn't let him. She wouldn't have minded letting him suck on a pussy that had been filled all weekend with strange cock, but she wasn't about to suck his cock after it had been in strange pussy. He knew she was pissed over what had transpired over the weekend so she knew he wouldn't push. When he spread her legs she pulled her knees back to give him better access and then she wiggled a bit, faked some moans while he banged her. She didn't start getting into it until she started comparing him to her weekend lovers. His cock wasn't as long as Friday's stud and it wasn't as big around as Saturday's and he wasn't pushing her buttons near as well as Sunday's lover. Thinking of her three strange cocks helped her have an orgasm which Jake probably thought he gave her. 

 When it was over she rolled over and pretended to go to sleep and as Jake started to softly snore she was already working on a plan to get herself laid at the wedding she would be working that weekend. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© The first thing next morning she turned on her computer and accessed the file on the wedding she had coming up that weekend. She had made a check list based on what the bride and the bride's mother had specified. The flowers had been ordered, the kitchen had been given the menu and housekeeping had the floor plan for the table set-up. The bride's mother had specified a u-shaped arrangement and had furnished a chart showing the seating arrangement and place cards had been ordered. 

 The groom had said he wanted a live music and not a DJ so she had arranged for a band and had given them a list of the songs that the bride and groom wanted played at some point during the reception. The groom's father had stopped by her office and asked that she make sure that the bar have Famous Grouse scotch on hand and a call to catering found that Famous Grouse was not a brand kept in stock so she had ordered a case of it. 

 By ten she had everything well in hand for the coming weekend's wedding and she started making up a check list for the one on the weekend following. By lunch time she had it pretty much roughed out. The only problem she saw with it was that the bride's mother was insisting on the flowers coming from a specific florist, one that the hotel did not have a contract with. It was a problem in that the hotel insisted that business be done only with firms they had contracts with. She would have to take it up with Dan. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 One of the perks of her job was that her meals in the hotel restaurant were free and so that is where she almost always had her lunch. As she sat there waiting for her taco salad she sipped her iced tea and gave some thought to her situation. She'd had a ball over the weekend and she had enjoyed the hell out of it. If fact, she had enjoyed it so much that she didn't really want to sexually limit herself to her cheating ass husband and some guy from a wedding once a week. 

 She had liked sampling strange cock and she wanted to sample more. She wanted to go home and at night, when they went to bed, she wanted to give Jake some freshly used pussy. Well, maybe not "freshly used" as in only an hour or so old, but pussy that had been used at sometime during that day. 

 She smiled at the thought of spreading her legs so Jake could eat her pussy; shoving his tongue into her pussy after another man's cock had been there. The thought of him licking her and sucking on her clit after it had been bathed in another man's cum excited her and made her pussy wet. However, as much as she would love to do it she would never take a pussy full of cum home to Jake. The idea was to hang horns on the asshole for the next twenty or thirty years and never have him find out. No, she would always go home clean; used, but clean. 

 The question was how to do it more often than once a week at a wedding. She did stop after work occasionally and have a drink or two with her co-workers, but that was only once every two or three weeks. If she started to do it more often it might raise a red flag where Jake was concerned. Whatever she did would have to be done in a way that would never give Jake cause to become suspicious. And, whatever she did would have to be done during the day unless Jake was out of town on business. 

 The obvious answer was to get something going with a co-worker. She did have a master-key card to the hotels hospitality suites so a place to do it wouldn't be a problem. But could she take the chance that whoever she did it with wouldn't talk about it? The last thing she needed, next to Jake finding out, would be for it to become common knowledge among the staff that she could be had. 

 There was the possibility of having something to do with a guest. That could work. Get some one who was passing through and who would be gone in a day or so. It wouldn't matter if he bragged because he would be miles and miles away. But would he? A lot of people from close by stayed at the hotel. Some because work was being done in their homes; some because of personal problems at home and some because they didn't want to drive home after drinking. She would need to make sure that the guest lived at least a thousand miles away. 

 Her thoughts were interrupted by the waiter bringing her the salad she had ordered. Nice looking guy she thought, too bad he works at the hotel. He looked like he might be fun. She looked around the restaurant and saw any number of guys she wouldn't mind playing with and several of them were looking at her. She wondered what they were thinking. Business woman on lunch break? Bored housewife at the hotel looking for a little fun? A call girl cruising the hotel looking for a customer? Wouldn't that be a kick; having some one come up to her and ask her how much. What would she say? How would it feel to give Jake pussy that another man had paid for? 

 She finished her lunch and then hurried back to her desk. She called Marci and asked if she could get in to see Dan and Marci said to give her a few minutes and she would check. Three minutes later Marci called her back and told her that Dan could see her right away if she could hurry over. When she got to Dan's office Marci said: 

 "He's a real bear today honey. Something to do with his ex-wife so stay away from family talk if you know what I mean." 

 "I didn't even know he had an ex-wife. I always thought that he was a confirmed bachelor." 

 "Hardly. I wish I had a dime for every time he's tried to get me to have drink with him after work." 

 "He asks even thought he knows you are married?" 

 "Oh come on Fran; you know that wedding rings don't slow them down. They look at the fact that you are married as meaning you aren't a virgin any more and you will know what to do if they can get you alone." 

 "Dan does that?" 

 "Oh yeah sweetie; that's why his last secretary quit. He just would not stop hitting on her. Although I do suspect that the real problem was that her husband worked here also. Better get in there Fran; he is pretty busy today." 

 As she walked into Dan's office she wondered if what Marci had said was true. Dan had never hit on her and she looked at least - at the very least - as good as Marci. Dan looked up from his desk and said: 

 "Whacha need hon?" 

 He had never called her anything but Fran before so what was up with that? She explained her florist problem and asked how she should go about handling it. He thought for a minute and then said: 

 "Do you know what she wants as far as floral arrangements go?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Explain to her that the contract she signed with us covers flowers. If she wants to use her own florist tell her to go ahead, but we will not be giving any refund from our contracted price because of it. Anything else?" 

 "No, that was my only problem." 

 "How did your weekend go?" 

 Marci had just finished telling her to stay away from family talk, but Marci had said that Dan had hit on Marci and here he had just called her 'hon' so curiosity got the best of her and she said: 

 "Not so good in one way, but not bad in another." 

 "That is an interesting answer." 

 "Jake took off without me and that pissed me off so that's not so good; we are barely speaking right now. On the other hand since I had the weekend to myself I went out and partied. I ended up having a damned good time." 

 "You went out and partied without your husband? You must have been fighting guys off all weekend." 

 "Who fought?" 

 He looked at her and grinned. "My kind of girl. We should continue this conversation over a drink." 

 "I think I'd like that." 

 "What does your calendar look like for this afternoon?" 

 "I'm caught up." 

 "Why don't you meet me at the Bistro at four?" 

 "I can do that." 

 As she left Dan's office she was smiling and Marci said, "You are smiling and he didn't bite your head off so it must have gone okay." 

 "He hit on me." 

 "What did you do?" 

 "I smiled." 

 "You better watch yourself girl. I don't think you know what you are getting yourself into." 

 Oh but I think I do she thought to herself as she headed back to her office. As high up the food chain as Dan is it isn't very likely he will do any bragging or spreading the word that she is a married woman who is willing to play. As a back-up, since she did work for him, she could always use the sexual harassment ploy if she needed to. On the plus side if they did anything it could be done during the day at work in any of the available empty hotel rooms. Oh yes Marci, I do think I know what I'm letting myself in for. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was sitting in a booth at Barney's Bistro sipping a frozen margarita when Dan arrived. When he sat down she saw the looks of disappointment on the faces of several men who had trying to work up the courage to approach her and try their luck. Dan ordered a beer and then said: 

 "I don't like to waste a lot of time beating about the bush Fran so let me put it right out there. Are you here after what I'm here after?" 

 "It depends Dan. You have to tell me what you are looking for." 

 "You are a great looking woman Fran; great looking and sexy as hell. I've wanted you since the day you came to work." 

 "Then why haven't you ever made a pass at me?" 

 "Two reasons. One, you are married and two, I don't mess around in my own sandbox." 

 "Marci is married and she works in your sandbox and according to her you hit on her all the time." 

 "That's just flirting and Marci and I both know it and we both know that is all it ever will be." 

 "I'm married, in your sandbox and it sure sounds to me like you want to get something going." 

 "True, but I think you are the exception to the rule. I stay away from married women who work for me because you usually can't tell if they are happily married or not. Take a shot at the wrong one and you end up on the bad end of a sexual harassment complaint. The reason I think you might be the exception to the rule is the tone of voice and the way you said, "Who fought?" when we talked about your weekend. If I'm wrong in what I'm thinking then we have enjoyed a drink together and I'll see you at work tomorrow." 

 "You aren't afraid that I'll take it as sexual harassment?" 

 "Not at all. Nothing was asked for, nothing was offered and I can always say that you were a little upset over what happened over the weekend and I offered to have a drink with you and give you a shoulder to cry on." 

 She looked at him for several seconds and then said, "And if I am here for what you are here for? What then?" 

 "I'd suggest we finish our drinks and go on back to the hotel." 

 "I'll need to hit a drug store first." 

 "What for?" 

 "I'll need to get a douche bag and some douche. When I have Jake eat my pussy tonight I don't want him tasting you. I want the kick I'll get knowing that he is eating a pussy that another man has played in, but I don't want him tasting something that might make him suspicious. That would end my fun." 

 "You are that pissed at him for going off and leaving you last weekend?" 

 "Oh you bet I am. There was a little more to it than him just going off without me." She told Dan what had happened. "So it is revenge time for me. I was completely faithful to that asshole, but that's over with now. My goal now is to see to it that every time he fucks me he is the second man that day. They won't be sloppy, but they will be seconds." 

 "I'm more than happy to be able to contribute to the cause. Shall we go?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As she drove home she thought about how lucky she was that she had connected with Dan. It made things so much easier for her. What they did together could be done during the day at work and that would eliminate having to use the excuse that she was stopping with the girls for a drink after work when she wanted some strange cock. 

 With Dan during the day and her intention of fucking at least one member of every wedding she worked she would be able to give Jake plenty of 'seconds'. And if her afternoon romp with Dan was any indication she was really going to enjoy the time she would spend being used so Jake could get leftovers. Her pussy tingled as she remembered what they had done. 

 As soon as she and Dan had gotten back to the hotel they had gone to Dan's office and pulled up a list of the rooms not in use. Room 304 was on the "The not available" list because it was being repainted so they had hurried to it. Their clothes were coming off before the door was completely closed behind them. Dan pulled the plastic drop cloth off the bed and dropped it on the floor and then he had pulled her down on the uncovered bed. 

 "You want foreplay" he asked and she had said, "Hell no. Just put it in and fuck me." 

 "Can't do that. I have to taste you first" and he had pushed her legs apart and buried his face in her pussy. She squealed like it was her first time and had pushed her hips up at his mouth and moaned. He attacked her clit and she cried out as she had a small orgasm. 

 "You are one hot little slut" Dan had said as he pulled his face away from her pussy and moved up so that his hard cock was touching her pussy lips. "Do you want it?" 

 "Oh yes, I most definitely want it." 

 "Tell me what you want." 

 "Fuck me. Put your cock in me and fuck me." 

 "No missy, you have to put it in." 

 She had reached out and had taken his cock in her hand and had pulled it to her so that his cock head parted her cunt lips and then she pushed her hips up at him and an inch or two of his meat had entered her. He smiled and then drove his cock the rest of the way into her. She was wet and she was ready, but still the full length of him driving into her with one hard push had taken her breath away. Dan had started fucking her and she had cried out: 

 "Oh yes, oh yes lover; it feels so fucking good. Fuck me lover, fuck me hard." 

 Her legs locked onto his hips and her nails clawed at his back as she urged him on and he drove himself harder. 

 "Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes" she moaned as she felt another orgasm start to build. "Harder, harder, fuck me harder, make me cum." Dan had slammed his cock into her and she had screamed as the orgasm took her. Seconds later she felt the hot, wet splash inside her that told her he had reached his own climax. 

 Dan held himself in her until he began to soften and when he finally pulled out he had asked: 

 "How long have we got?" 

 She had told him that she had to shower and douche and get home to fix dinner and then she had said: 

 "We can start earlier next time so that it can last longer." 

 "Next time is tomorrow, right?" 

 "I wouldn't miss it" she had answered. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was only a half hour later than her usual time in getting home from work and she was able to blame that on a traffic accident that slowed things down. As she fixed dinner she made small talk with Jake and let him know that she was expecting a little bedroom fun after the dishes were done and put away. She headed for the bedroom while Jake took out the garbage and when he came into the room she was on the bed naked and with her legs spread wide. She was running a finger back and forth in her pussy and she said: 

 "Getting it juicy for you baby, I know how much you like the taste. I've been lying here thinking of your magic mouth and I'm hot and ready baby." She smiled with wicked pleasure as Jake lowered his mouth to her recently fucked pussy. She moaned as she felt his tongue slide in and his lips start sucking. She pushed her pussy at his face and moaned again. Jake took his mouth off of her long enough to say: 

 "You like this baby? You like it when I do this?" 

 "Oh God yes; I love it honey. Don't stop honey, don't stop" and she moaned again as his mouth went back to work. 

 Hopefully, she thought, there was still one small drop of Dan's cum in her that the douche hadn't washed out. Not enough for Jake to notice a different taste, but just enough for his tongue to lick up. Just the thought of that maybe happening gave her a small orgasm. 

 Jake used his hands to roll her over and then pull her up on her knees. He gripped her hips and entered her from behind. She thought of Dan as Jake fucked her and she smiled as she thought of how much more used pussy she was going to give her loving husband. 

 As she faded off to sleep she thought of what a shame it was that she had to clean herself up after Dan. It would be such a turn on to feed Jake Dan's cum and let him soak his cock in Dan's juices. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The rest of the week was busy for her. She had a convention of ball bearing manufacturers using the Aspen Room and a sales seminar in the "B" ballroom to take care of and she had to stay on top of the wedding scheduled for Saturday. She also had to bury herself in the details of the monster weekend she had coming up the week after. She had three weddings on that weekend. 

 And every afternoon around two-thirty she got a phone call from Dan asking her to meet him in a room. She would grab her travel bag from under her desk, go to the appointed room and spend two or three hours being a wanton slut. When it was over she would shower, douche and then go home to her cheating asshole of a husband. The only bad thing was that she couldn't fuck Jake and give him seconds every night. She'd read somewhere that one of the signs of infidelity was an increase in sexual activity so she had to be careful not to break the normal pattern of their having sex. She thought again of how quickly she had gone from thinking of it as making love to calling it just having sex. 

 Thursday night at the dinner table she asked Jake what his plans were for the weekend. 

 "Why?" 

 "I wondered if tomorrow is your bi-monthly poker game and if you plan on playing golf with Sid on Saturday." 

 "Yes to both. Why?" 

 "If you aren't going to be home I'll stick around at work and make sure that the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner go off okay. The wedding is at eleven on Saturday and you won't be home from golf till after two so I might run in to work and make a last minute check on things. If you were going to be here I'd pass on doing those things." 

 "No need to take a pass this weekend, but don't make any plans for Saturday night. We are going out. Dinner and dancing. Sound okay to you?" 

 She said, "You bet" as she thought "Yes indeed you cheating shit-head. We can celebrate my first full week of getting back at you." 

 As she was doing the dinner dishes she wondered about Jakes twice monthly poker games. It had never been held at their house. Did he really get with the guys and play poker or was he out with some woman poking her? 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The first part of Friday was a bit of a drag. Dan had to fly to New York for something or other so her afternoon was free. She hadn't realized how much she looked forward to her afternoon play time. She hoped that she would be able to make something happen at the rehearsal or the rehearsal dinner since she was horny as hell. Jake would scratch the itch when she got home, but she did not want him to be the first one that night. Hell, she never again wanted him to be first. 

 She sat off to the side during the rehearsal and looked over the assembled males. Any one of them would do. The bride groom looked real yummy, but he only had eyes for his bride to be. She looked at the two of them and silently wished them better luck with their marriage than she was having with hers. 

 She caught one of the ushers glancing her way and she gave him a smile and he smiled back. The next time he looked over her way he saw that she was looking at him and he smiled and she smiled back as she adjusted her skirt to show a little more leg. The next time he looked he saw her sitting there looking back at him with a high heel dangling from her left foot. She didn't understand it, but that seemed to grab the attention of some men and getting a man's attention was what the night was all about for her.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© When the rehearsal was over she led the group to the banquet hall where the rehearsal dinner was being held. Once every one was seated she invited them to stick around after the dinner and enjoy dancing to the live band in the lounge. 

 "As an incentive to stay we are giving you your first drink on the house" and then she circulated and handed them all a complimentary ticket to give to the bartender or their waitress. She deliberately timed it so the last person she gave a ticket to was the usher she had been flirting with. As he took it he said: 

 "I'm here alone tonight so if I'm going to take advantage of your offer to stick around I'm going to need a dance partner. Will you be there?" 

 She looked at him for a moment and then said, "I suppose I could stick around for a couple of dances." 

 He was a good dancer and she enjoyed dancing with him. She wondered if she should be forward and make a move on him or wait for him to make the move. But what if she waited and he didn't do anything? What if he was just being a nice guy - just being sociable? She was short on time and she needed to get it done and get home at a reasonable time. Reasonable meaning before Jake. He usually got home from his poker (poke her?) game around midnight. 

 Just as she decided that she was going to have to be the one to push it she felt his hand slide down from her waist to rest on the cheek of her ass. She responded by moving in to him and was delighted when her leg touched a very hard bulge. She saw him looking at her to see her reaction and she smiled and pushed her leg harder against his cock. 

 "Are you really all that interested in dancing" he asked, "Or is there something that you would rather do?" 

 "What would be your best guess on that?" 

 "My apartment isn't that far away." 

 "Then why are we standing out here in the middle of the dance floor?" 

 She followed him to his apartment and when just inside the door he turned to take her in his arms and kiss her she pushed him away. 

 "We both know what we are here for so lets not waste any time. Lead me to your bedroom." 

 When they got to the bedroom they were already naked and they fell on the bed. She pulled him on top of her, grabbed his hard cock and pulled it to her slit. 

 "Push it in" she moaned, "Push it in and fuck me." 

 He hesitated and she grabbed his hips and made him shove it in. She pushed up at him and hissed: 

 "Fuck me damn it, fuck me!" 

 He grabbed her ankles and held her legs up in the air and pushed his cock deep into her and then he started to pound her pussy. The bed shook and rattled and she moaned and cried and clutched at him. In only minutes he moaned: 

 "I'm gonna cum, I can't hold it, I'm cumming" and he started to pull away from her. 

 "No!" she cried and she grabbed at him with her hands. "In me, I want it in me" and then she felt his spurts and they triggered her orgasm. 

 He pulled out and even though she had just climaxed she wasn't ready to stop. She moved so that she could take his cock in her mouth and work on it. She took hold of his cock, kissed it, licked the shaft from the tip to his balls and then back and then she took the cock head in her mouth. 

 "Oh yeah baby, suck it, suck my cock" he moaned. 

 "Come on honey, fuck my mouth" she said as she sucked on him. He began to grow and she pulled her mouth away from him and said, "Fuck me now, come on lover, put it in and fuck me." 

 He lifted her legs up on his shoulders and pushed his cock into her slippery cunt and she moaned as he slid into her. "Oh yeah baby, hard, fuck me hard." 

 "You are one nasty bitch" he said, "I don't believe I've ever fucked a slut as horny as you." 

 "I'm horny all right, so fuck me, really fuck me. Pound my pussy and make it cum." 

 "You slut" he moaned as he fucked her as hard as he was able. He drove into her and she pushed back and the two of them had clawed and grabbed at each other until finally he told her he was cumming again and she hollered out "Oh yes!" as the two of them came together. 

 As she was dressing he asked her when he could see her again. "You can't lover. This was a one time thing. I loved it and I'll remember it, but it will never happen again." 

 She beat Jake home by half an hour and that gave her time to shower and douche and be ready for him. 

 She was in bed when Jake got home and as he undressed she asked, "Were you a winner or a loser tonight?" 

 "I lost a little." 

 "Poor baby. Come over here and let me console you." 

 She spread her legs wide in invitation. He knew she liked to start their love making with having her pussy eaten and as he moved into place and lowered his face to her honey pot he said: 

 "What if I had won?" 

 "Then I would have said, "Come her and let me congratulate you" or maybe, "Come here and lets celebrate." 

 As his tongue slid into her recently used pussy she smiled. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© While she sat at her desk and waited for the computer to come up she took the small spiral note pad she had purchased Saturday out of her purse. She still hadn't made up her mind how she wanted to record her illicit meetings. The date and number of times? Just the date and a check mark? Just a check mark on each line to represent a lover? There would be no names or descriptions; no number of stars to denote how great the time had been. She smiled as she remembered Friday night with Scott. He would have gotten three and a half stars after his check mark. 

 She finally decided on just the date and a check mark and got out a pen and brought the notebook up to date. There were the three guys from the first weekend, Dan, and then Scott from Friday night. That made five in one week after years and years of only Jake. She wondered how many of those years Jake had been cheating on her. No matter; the one she knew about was enough. She dropped the notebook back in her purse and started in on her days work. 

 Her first order of business was to handle the florist problem with the Burkett wedding. She called Elise Caldwell, the bride's mother and explained that flowers were included in the contract she had signed. If she wanted to use her own florist it was fine, but there wouldn't be any refund on the contracted price. The woman said she had not realized that flowers were included in the contract and she certainly wasn't going to pay double for flowers. She said she would contact her florist and cancel the order. 

 Next order of business was the catering for the Heinzmann wedding. It was not being held at the hotel, but the hotel's catering unit would be doing the food. She made a couple of phone calls and got the scheduling worked out. 

 Next on her list was the "turn key" wedding for the Masterson's. The idea of "turn key" weddings had come to her when a girlfriend had bemoaned the fact that she wanted a traditional wedding, but couldn't see how to make it happen. The friend had a job that took up a huge amount of her time and left her little or no time to do the things that had to be done in order for her to have the wedding she wanted. Also, both her family and her fiancé's family were in different states and the usual wedding arrangers - the moms - weren't available. 

 She had given the idea some thought and then had approached Dan with the idea. They would do it all. Arrange for the minister, the food, the music, the flowers and even the wedding dresses and tuxedos. All the bridal party had to do was show up for the wedding rehearsal and then go through with the wedding. Dan had given her the go-ahead and it had been a huge success. Since then she had done seventeen of them and they had all gone off like clockwork. 

 She took out the Full Service wedding checklist and got out her notes that she had taken when she had gone to lunch with the bride and groom. Her first call was to Beatrice's Bridal Boutique. She gave Beatrice the time of the rehearsal dinner and then called Toddman's Men's Apparel and gave her contact there the same information. Representatives from the two businesses would be at the rehearsal and would take the measurements of the people in the wedding party. The would have samples available and the bride and groom would select the styles and colors they wanted and the clothes would be delivered to the hotel the morning of the wedding and the members of the wedding party would change clothes in the rooms provided. 

 Next, she looked at her list of ministers and started calling them until she found one who was available for the day and time of the wedding. At her lunch with the couple they had given her their preferences where music was concerned and she arranged for the appropriate band. They had also picked what they wanted in the way of food and alcohol for the reception and a call to the hotel's catering unit took care of that. She arranged for the flowers and then it was lunch time. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She hadn't been back from lunch fifteen minutes when she got a call from Dan asking her if she could meet him in room 602. "Poor baby must be anxious" she thought, "Must not have gotten any over the weekend." She grabbed her purse and her travel bag containing her douche and douche bag and headed for the room. 

 She used her master key card to get into the room and was not surprised when she found Dan naked and waiting. His cock was hard and pointing up at the ceiling and she giggled and said: 

 "Is that for little ole me?" 

 She was stepping out of her skirt when Dan answered, "I don't know. I called for room service. Is that why you are here? To service me?" 

 "Well, normally Housekeeping takes care of dirty things on the bed, but seeing that I'm already here I may as well just go ahead and take care of it." 

 "That is one of the great things about this hotel - a dedicated work force." 

 "And enthusiastic. Don't forget enthusiastic." 

 She reached for his cock and said, "Since service is what we are going to deliver, may I ask your requirements sir?" 

 "I'm too horny to waste time on head so how's about you climb on and ride em cowgirl." 

 "Oh goody. Can I yell out, "Yippie-ki-yay?" 

 "You can do anything you want as long as you don't let it slip out." 

 "Fat chance of that" she said as she swung over him and guided him into her pussy. It took her five minutes of sliding up and down and rocking back and forth on his cock to get him off and then she giggled and said, "Not afraid of your own stuff are you?" and she swung over him in a sixty-nine and her mouth went for his cock. It took another five minutes to get him back up and the she got on her hands and knees and wiggled her butt at him. He took the hint and moved in behind her and slid his cock into her hot, wet cunt. He gripped her hips with his hands and started fucking her. 

 "Oh yes lover, like that" she moaned as he slid deep into her. "Fuck Jake's pussy. Fuck Jake's pussy hard." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 All during the drive home that night and all during dinner her pussy tingled in anticipation of her sitting on Jake's face when they went to bed that night. Just the thought of Jake sliding his tongue into the pussy that Dan had only recently fucked made her wet and she wished - not for the first time - that she could have Dan's cum in her when Jake covered her pussy with his mouth. One day she would, but not until she was ready to end it with Jake. 

 She was lying in bed naked with her legs spread and running a finger in her pussy when Jake came into the bedroom. He looked at her waiting for him and said: 

 "I sometimes wonder about you." 

 "In what way?" 

 "Other guys who have been married as long as we have are always complaining about how they only get sex once or twice a week and yet we have barely slowed down since our first time." 

 "Ever stop to think that the problem is with them and not their wives? Maybe they aren't getting the job done so their wives don't have any interest in them any more. Maybe they don't eat pussy - hint, hint." 

 "Subtle aren't we?" 

 "This wife knows what she wants. Bring me that beautiful cock and let's do some math." 

 "Do some math?" 

 "Yes Sweetie. Remember Sesame Street? The part where they would say, "Today's number is...?" Well on this street tonight's number is 69 so how about you getting over here and we start counting." 

 As her mouth worked on Jake's cock she imagined Dan's cum sliding out of her pussy into Jake's mouth and then down into his belly. Just the thought of Jake sucking up Dan's leavings triggered the start of her first orgasm. Jake pushed her away and got her on her hands and knees and as he drove into her from behind she remembered that afternoon when Dan had done the same thing and she had another orgasm. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next two days it was business as usual as she planned, scheduled, coordinated and interacted with all the businesses she had to deal with be it for weddings, conventions or trade shows. Her afternoons were spent with Dan's cock plunging into her pussy or trying to get all the way down her throat and into her belly. 

 She didn't fuck Jake Tuesday night, but she did kiss him and slip him some tongue from the mouth that had spent a goodly bit of time that afternoon sucking on Dan's cock. Wednesday night when she did fuck Jake two of her three orgasms came because she was thinking about what Dan had done to her that afternoon. The third one was caused by Jake. He was a marvelous lover even if he was a cheating asshole. 

 When they were done she rolled over and fell asleep wondering if she would be able to get a lover out the next wedding. 

 At breakfast she reminded Jake that she would be late that night. "I have the Masterson wedding rehearsal tonight and it is a turn key wedding and all the fittings take up more time than the usual rehearsals." 

 "When are you going to give up that job Fran? You don't need it. We don't need it. I make more than enough so you don't have to make a paycheck." 

 "I do need it Jake. I have to have something to do with my time. If you want me to stay home get me pregnant." 

 "I don't think that the Gods that be want us to have kids. Lord knows we have been trying for nine years now." 

 "You have" she thought, "But I haven't." When she and Jake had first gotten married she had looked forward to having children. That is she had until she saw how totally disruptive kids could be in your life. She saw friend after friend go nuts trying to cope with babies and still keep the romance in her marriage. A good third of those marriages had ended in divorce. She had early on decided that she wanted the romance to last more than she wanted to hear the pitter-patter of little feet so she had put herself on strict birth control. Birth control pills, diaphragms and spermicides were a major part of her life. 

 Jake didn't know and she never intended for him to find out. When she hadn't become pregnant during those first years of their marriage Jake had insisted that they go in and be tested. The tests had shown that they were both fully capable and Jake had accepted that they would just have to be patient and let it happen. For years she had felt guilty over denying him children, but now she was glad she had. Divorce was hard on children and divorce was where she and Jake were headed. Hopefully it wouldn't happen anytime soon, at least not until she had gotten plenty of revenge, but it would happen. Maybe she would have a baby, just not Jake's. Wouldn't that be a kick? Have a baby and let him think it was his and he could pay her child support for eighteen years so she could take care of another man' offspring. Now that would be revenge! 

 Her day at work was spent stamping out small fires. One of the unions was threatening to throw a picket line in front of the hotel over a dispute on who was going to handle the set up work for an automotive parts manufacturer's trade show scheduled for the main ballroom. Catering told her that they wouldn't be able to furnish the center-piece for the main table for the Namur wedding; something about an ice carver who wasn't answering his phone. Housekeeping didn't have enough tables and chairs to cover the two trade shows, the motivational sales meeting and the three business conferences scheduled for the next week. All of that taken care of she got busy on the final details for the nights rehearsal and fittings. 

 A two o'clock call from Dan resulted in a two hour bout of recreational sex in room 112. She had walked into the room expecting to find him already naked and on the bed and she was not disappointed. It was different from most of their fuck sessions in that this time Dan got some sort of satisfaction out of denigrating Jake and she was only too happy to go along. 

 "I know that the only reason you are here is that your husband has a small cock and can't satisfy you. That revenge story was just so much bullshit. You are here because you love my cock. Admit it. You are here because I've made you my bitch." 

 "No, it isn't true. I am only here for revenge." 

 He pulled here down on the bed and pulled her head down to his cock. "You can't shit me you slut. You are here because you can't get enough of this" and he pushed his cock against her lips. 

 She resisted a fraction of a second and then gave him a fake moan as she opened her mouth and let him push his cock in it. 

 "That's it you little whore, suck it. Taste a good cock instead of that puny little thing your husband has." 

 She worked on his cock for a minute or so and then Dan pulled it out of her mouth and said, "Admit it bitch. You want this cock and that is why you are here." 

 "No damn you, I love my husband. I'm only doing this to punish him." 

 "Then go and punish him some place else" and he pulled away from her. 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "You want me to fuck you it has to be because you WANT me to fuck you, not because you want to get even with Jake." 

 "Please don't go. I'm ready; I need it." 

 "Not bad enough it would seem" and he bent to pick up his pants. 

 "No, please come back here." 

 He pulled one pant leg on and she cried, "Okay damn you, I admit it. Jake is a small dicked wuss and he can't satisfy me. Now get over here and show me that you can." 

 "I'm better than Jake and you know it. I want to hear you say it." 

 "Jake can't fuck me like you do. You are so much better." 

 "How much better?" 

 "You make me cum more than he ever did. Now please come over here and fuck me." 

 He crawled between her legs and said, "You want it; you put it in." 

 She grabbed his dick and pulled it to her pussy and got the head started and then Dan drove it home. The two of them fucked steady for ten minutes and she had three orgasms before Dan blew his load in her. She sucked him hard and he had fucked her a second time and then she had to get back to work. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 At the rehearsal she checked out the men present and decided that any one of them would do. She began watching them to see if any of them showed any interest in her and she was delighted when the eyes of the father of the groom kept turning to her. When the rehearsal was over she made a point of being next to him when he was measured for his tux. She all ready knew that he was divorced and from out of town and was at the rehearsal alone. She heard him say: 

 "I hate wearing these monkey suits. I don't see why people can't get hitched in their regular clothes. Why not a good suit instead of a tux." 

 It was an opening and she took it. "I think you will look very distinguished in a tuxedo." 

 "That's a cold shot." 

 "How so?" 

 "I thought I looked pretty good without one." 

 "I'll give you that, but we are talking "good" versus "distinguished." 

 "And distinguished would get me what as opposed to what good would get me?" 

 "Good point." 

 "I take since you work here you live in the area and might know something about the area's night life?" 

 "Some." 

 "Where could a single out of town guy like me go to find some action?" 

 "The lounge here in the hotel is as good a place as any. It has a pretty good live band and that pulls in a lot of people." 

 "Lots of women?" 

 "I'd say that there will probably be a nice assortment." 

 "So you think a guy like me could find some one?" 

 "I'd be willing to bet on it." 

 It was another half hour before everyone was measured and when it was done she headed for the lounge. She saw him sitting at a table next to the dance floor and she walked over and sat down with him. 

 "Hey sailor; buy a girl a drink?" 

 "Good thing I didn't take your bet." 

 "I only bet on sure things. Are you a sure thing?" 

 "Why didn't we do this while we were upstairs? Would have saved me some time, the cost of a couple of drinks and my room was only one floor away." 

 "True, but I was on the clock and there are some things I can't do on company time." 

 "Do you really want that drink or is there something that you would rather have?" 

 "I think you already know the answer to that sweetie." 

 "Then let us get the hell out of here and get to it." 

 In the elevator he said, "I noticed your rings. Do I have to be quick so you can get on home?" 

 "Don't you dare be quick, but yes, I do have to get home by eleven. That gives us two and a half hours. Plenty of time if we use it wisely." 

 Inside the room he wasted no time in undressing and neither did she. He pulled her to him and kissed her, slipping her a little tongue. She sent hers into his mouth and the two tongues dueled for several moments and then he broke the kiss and lowered his mouth to her hard nipples. She slid her hand down his body, grasped his cock and started to stroke it. His hand slid down to her pussy and he started to rub her clit and she moaned. He picked her up and placed her on the bed and she hissed out: 

 "Fuck me lover, fuck me now." 

 He penetrated her and she pushed up at him as he drove himself deep into her. Her legs clamped around him and he started fucking her hard. For maybe three minutes he pounded her pussy hard and then he groaned: 

 "I'm close baby, real close. Are you protected?" 

 She was, but thought it would be more of a turn on for him if she said no. "No lover, but it doesn't matter. In me, I want you to put it in me." She felt his spurts as he let go in her and as he softened and pulled out she said: 

 "Again lover; I want to do it again." 

 "As soon as I can get it up again honey." 

 "I'll help" she said as she changed position and moved her head to his crotch. She licked their combined juices off of his limp cock and then took the head into her mouth and started sucking on him. Slowly his cock started to rise and when it was hard enough to suit her she swung over him and slid down on his erection. She rode him until he came again and then he went down on her. As he licked up his own juices she wished that it was Jake down there cleaning her out. After several minutes she pushed him away and moved into a sixty-nine and when he was hard she rolled over on her back, spread her legs wide and said: 

 "Again lover, fuck me again." 

 A she was dressing he asked, "Does your husband know? Is he one of those guys who gets off on his wife taking on lovers?" 

 "No. He doesn't have a clue that I play around." 

 "Just out of curiosity, why do you do it?" 

 "Because while my husband is a nice guy and a good provider he doesn't get the job done where it counts - in the bedroom. On a good night I get three minutes and then he is done and rolls over and goes to sleep. Most nights I don't even get three." 

 "I'll be here through Sunday." 

 "I can only get out on nights I work and tonight was it for this week." 

 "Can I call you the next time I'm in town?" 

 "I'm sorry, but no. I don't take too many chances. Tonight just turned out lucky for both of us." 

 She left his room, went to her office and got her travel bag and then used her master key to get into one of the rooms used for the fittings. It wouldn't get maid service until the following morning. She showered, douched herself, and as the nozzle of the douche bag slid into her pussy she thought of the cock that had just been there and how Jake would be getting his seconds within the next hour or so. She smiled as she reminded herself to make a check mark in her notebook. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 04 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Monday was a busy day for her. She had a trade show that was running from Tuesday to Thursday, a motivational seminar to set up for Wednesday and two weddings coming up on the weekend. For the first time since she had started her affair with Dan when he called her and asked her to meet him in room 617 she was reluctant to go. She just had too much on her desk. But she hadn't had sex with Jake since Friday night so they would almost certainly have sex that night and she couldn't pass up a chance to give him his 'seconds.' 

 It was enjoyable as always - and when she was getting dressed Dan asked: 

 "Have you given any thought to what you are going to do when you get caught?" 

 "I don't intend to get caught." 

 "But you will. It is inevitable. No one ever thinks they will get caught when they cheat and I will grant you that some don't, but only because they do it only once or twice and then stop. Those who continue doing it always get caught. Think about your case. Do you think Jake thought he was going to get caught? No he didn't, but circumstances put you in the right place at the wrong time for him and the same could, and eventually probably will happen to you." 

 "So what's your point?" 

 "I'm just asking if you have thought ahead." 

 "No, I guess I haven't. Some day, way down the road, I intend to let him know that I found out about him and that I have been getting even, but I'm thinking years before I do that. Why are you asking?" 

 "I was thinking of offering you a proposition that would help you get ready for the day when it comes." 

 "A proposition? What kind of a proposition?" 

 "Don't get pissed at me here; I'm just thinking of something that can benefit us both. You want to screw a bunch of guys to get even with Jake and I have guys who ask me to find them women. I have a list of girls that I use for the purpose and they make on the average of two thousand a night." 

 "You want me to be a prostitute?" 

 "Yes, but not really." 

 "Explain that to me." 

 "A prostitute stands on a corner or sits on a barstool and takes on anyone who has the price. You would be more of a high class call girl. You wouldn't be looking for customers; it would all be set up ahead of time. Say Bill calls me and says he will be in town on the twentieth for some meetings and he has to stay the night. He asks me if I can find him some company so I say sure and I call one of the girls on my list." 

 "So you are a pimp?" 

 "Nope. I don't take a dime for setting him up with a girl. I just do a favor for some one I know. Most of the girls on my list get fifteen hundred a night and they usually get a tip on top of that. If you are interested I can add you to my list. It would help you build up a slush fund for the day everything comes unglued for you." 

 "I don't know Dan. I don't think I can do it. I wouldn't have any problem screwing them, but there is no way that I could spend a night." 

 "Doesn't Jake go out of town on business trips? You could do it on the nights he is gone. I'm serious Fran. You could build yourself a very nice financial cushion against the day your marriage ends. And I do get some guys who are only looking for afternoon fun. I'm not trying to talk you into anything here Fran; all I'm doing is offering you a chance to do something different in sticking it to your husband." 

 "I'll have to think on it Dan. It sounds a little way out there for a girl like me. But I will give it some thought." 

 "Well sweetie, think about this while you are thinking. I've got a guy coming in tomorrow and he was wondering if I could find him some companionship for Wednesday afternoon. My other girls tell me he is a fun date and he tips well if you make him happy. If you are interested I'll give him to you instead of one of my other girls." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She did think about it. She thought about it all the way home and she thought about it as she fixed dinner. She was even thinking about it as she was giving Jake his 'seconds.' How would it feel letting Jake lick a pussy that had been bought and paid for by another man? Would it feel any different than him eating her or fucking her after Dan or one of the men from a wedding party? Would the fact that she took money for cuckolding him excite her more? 

 Something that Dan mentioned came back to her. "You could do it on the nights he is gone." She did intend to go out and pick up guys when Jake was out of town on business. If she was going to do it anyway why not get paid for it? Why not let Dan set it up instead of going out and taking pot luck. Then the thoughts were driven away by an approaching orgasm as Jake worked on her clit. 

 The next morning she asked Marci if Jake was available and Marci told her she would check. Five minutes later she called and said Dan could see her in ten minutes if she could make it. She went right over to Dan's office and while she was waiting to get in and see him Marci asked: 

 "How are you and Dan getting along?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "You told me that he hit on you and when I asked you what you did you said you smiled." 

 "I've done a little more than just smile if that is what you wanted to know and so far I'm not regretting it." 

 "Just be careful Fran." 

 Just then the intercom went off and Dan asked if she was there yet. Marci said she was and Dan said to send her right in. She walked in and sat down opposite Dan and said: 

 "I've thought about what you brought up yesterday and I think I'd like to try it at least once and see how it goes. But, never having done anything like that I have no idea of what to do." 

 "Ever gone out on a date and ended up in bed with the guy?" 

 "When I was in college." 

 "That's all there is too it. The only difference is that when it is over you have money in your purse." 

 "But what do I ask for? What do I charge?" 

 "You don't. You just go on a date and when it is over he hands you an envelope. You smile sweetly, tell him you had a good time and wouldn't mind seeing him again sometime." 

 "What if he doesn't give me an envelope?" 

 "Then the next time he calls me and tells me he is coming to town and asks me what I can do for him I hang up. It has only happened once in the last ten years." 

 "So I have no way of knowing what I'll make before hand?" 

 "Fran, let me be honest here. You were going to go out anyway when Jake was out of town and all you were going to get out of it besides getting laid was a couple of drinks that you wouldn't have had to pay for. So what do you care about what is in the envelope? If it was only twenty bucks you would still be ahead. But I will say this; none of my other girls has ever complained about what she got out of the deal. So, should I set you up for tomorrow afternoon?" 

 She hesitated for a second or so and then said, "What the hell; why not. If I don't like it I don't have to do it again." 

 "Good girl. I'm betting that you won't be disappointed. Since I won't be seeing you tomorrow I guess I'd better get my fill today. You feel up to wearing me out this afternoon?" 

 "Always lover, always." 

 And she had worn him out that afternoon. There was just something about sticking it to Jake that charged her batteries and made her feel like a sex machine and Dan, depending on how you looked at it, paid the price or reaped the benefit. 

 As she was dressing Dan told her that everything was set up for the next day. "Just go to the Hilton at one and tell the hostess that you are meeting Mr. Ferguson and from that point on treat it like a blind date." 

 "You don't book him into our hotel?" 

 "Usually I do, but since this is your first time I thought you might be more comfortable some place else." 

 "He does know that I have to be home by seven; that I'm not going to be spending the night?" 

 "He knows." 

 She was at the Hilton at five to one and when the hostess led her to Ferguson's table she was pleasantly surprised. He was an extremely attractive man and she wondered why he was paying for his fun. She wouldn't have expected him to have any trouble at all in picking up some one in any one of the local lounges. 

 His name was Sam and he was pleasant company. He had a nice sense of humor and she was very comfortable with him. After lunch he suggested a drink in his room and she of course said she would like that. In his room he took her in his arms and kissed her. It was a long, hot kiss with some tongue action and when he broke it and asked her what she would like to drink she said 

 "Water will do fine. Alcohol dulls my senses and I want to enjoy this to the fullest." 

 And she did. 

 They undressed each other and then he ate her to a screaming orgasm and then he mounted her and fucked her hard. He gave her two more orgasms before he had his and then she went down on him and licked his cock clean. She kept licking and sucking on him until he was hard again and then she mounted him and rode him cowgirl through three more orgasms before she was able to coax his seed out of his balls. 

 She rolled off of him and let her hand trail down his body until it came to his limp, wet cock: 

 "How soon before you think you might be able to go again?" 

 "You keep that up and it won't be long." 

 It was almost ten minutes before he was able to come erect again and when he slid into her he fucked her slow and easy through one more orgasm and then he sped up until he pumped his load into her. 

 And then she had rushed so she could beat Jake home and be showered and douched when he got there. 

 As Jake slid his cock into her well used pussy she was thinking of what a good lover Sam had been and how much she had enjoyed her afternoon with him. She hadn't looked in the envelope he handed her until she was in her car and she was astonished to find one thousand dollars in it. Four hours of absolute enjoyment and she was paid two hundred and fifty dollars an hour for something she would have done for free. When she moaned: 

 "Fuck me lover, fuck me" she was saying it to Jake, but she was thinking of Sam. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was Saturday night and once again Jake was sliding his cock into a well used pussy. She hadn't expected to bed anyone from the Baxter wedding party, but circumstances had dropped the best man right in her lap. 

 The wedding was a small one and it took place in the morning. Instead of a regular wedding reception there was a wedding brunch after which the happy couple was going to catch an afternoon flight to Cabo San Lucas. Normally she wouldn't have even been there, but Jake had a golf date and she didn't feel like sitting at home and so she had gone into work to check on things. She had looked into the banquet room where the brunch was being served and she was standing there looking at the newly married couple when the best man walked up to her and said: 

 "Sickening isn't it; the way they hang all over each other?" 

 "I think it is sweet." 

 "Just how sweet would you think it was if you knew that two nights ago she was in my bed?" 

 "You're joking, right?" 

 "Afraid not. It is killing me that she is going to be with him tonight instead of me." 

 "If you feel that way about it why didn't you marry her?" 

 "She turned me down. She said she liked me as a good friend and bedmate, but she didn't love me enough to marry me." 

 "And he still wanted you as his best man?" 

 "He doesn't know and God knows I'll never tell him." 

 They stood there looking at the couple and then he said, "It still pisses me off that she will be with him and I'll be alone." 

 "Is that love talking or are you just upset that he will be getting laid tonight and you won't?" 

 He was silent for a few moments and then said, "I guess it is a little bit of both." 

 "Well, I can't help you with the love part, but I could probably help you with the other." 

 He turned and looked at her and she smiled at him and said, "Well, they are going to be leaving in a few minutes and so your best man duties are done and I don't have anything else to do until three this afternoon." 

 "Now that is a coincidence. I don't have anything to do for the rest of the day either." 

 She didn't know about the rest of it, but it didn't take her long to find out why the bride had liked him as a bedmate. He was a passionate lover and he was superb when it came to eating pussy. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She got home before Jake and changed into a pair of Daisy Dukes and a tank top with no bra underneath. She knew the outfit would push Jake's buttons and he would want to make love by the time they went to bed. She'd read in Cosmo or some other magazine that one of the signs of a wife cheating was either a big slow down in the sex department or a significant increase in frequency so it was important for her to get Jake taking the lead in getting things going. 

 He had taken the lead and she was taking his cock deep into her as she thought about the three hours she had spent with the best man from the Baxter wedding. She had never learned his name, but he was now a checkmark in her little spiral notebook. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 05 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She had been at work an hour when she got a call from Jake. 

 "They have a situation in the Atlanta office and I have to fly down there. I'll probably be gone until Friday. I'll call you when I know more." 

 "When are you leaving?" 

 "I'll head for home as soon as I hang up, pack a bag and head for the airport." 

 "When you check into the hotel don't forget to show them your employee discount card." 

 "You know I never use it. It goes on my expense account and the company pays it." 

 "Don't you ever listen to me?" 

 "About what?" 

 Hotels Jake. If you stay in one of ours and show your discount card and a suite is available they will upgrade your room. You can stay in one of the suites for the cost of a regular room so even if your company does reimburse you, you still get a better room out of it. And the wet bar in the suites is complimentary." 

 "I didn't know that." 

 "Only because you never listen to me." 

 "I'm sure that you never mentioned the complimentary wet bar because I know I would have homed in on that." 

 "Whatever. Give me a call as soon as you know what your schedule is going to be." 

 "I will. I love you and I'll see you in a couple of days." 

 She hung up and seconds later she called Marci to see if Dan was available and he was so she hurried to his office to catch him before he got busy. 

 "What do you need sweetie" Dan asked as soon as she walked in the office. 

 "Two things. First, put me down on your list of girls. Second, Jake is flying to Atlanta today. Do you know anyone at our unit in Atlanta to ask for a favor?" 

 "Yes, as a matter of fact I do know a couple of guys and they both owe me favors." 

 "If it can be done I'd like to know what Jake does while he is there. I don't need pictures or anything like that; all I want is to know. Ever since I caught him at the beach I've wondered if he screws around on me whenever he is out of town on business." 

 "Should be easy enough to do. While we are on the subject, can I use you on the nights he is away?" 

 "Absolutely." 

 "I may have something for you tonight. Is that too soon?" 

 "Not in the least. Jake won't be here and my plan always was to go out and play when he is gone. The more guys I play with before I tell him will just make him that much more pissed off. That means that I had intended to go lounge shopping tonight. If you have something for me I won't have to." 

 "I should know by lunch time if Jared is going to be coming in from San Francisco. If he does he will want you for the night. Will that be a problem?" 

 "Not at all. Jake hardly ever calls when he is out of town. He will call me as soon as he gets to where he is going to tell me where he is staying and then I won't hear from him again until the night before he is coming home when he calls to give me his flight information." 

 "One more thing. Jared always stays here when he comes to town. Is that going to be a problem?" 

 "Shouldn't be. The people here are used to seeing me at all hours. I'll just have to be careful about being seen leaving his room." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The rest of the morning was spent doing all of the mundane things she did every day; talking with suppliers, arranging for all of the many things that went into the events she planned and coordinated. 

 She had her lunch in the hotel restaurant and as she ate she was thinking of back-up plans in case Dan didn't have something for her. She'd had good luck at the lounges and bars she'd gone to that first weekend when she'd found out that Jake was a cheating asshole. If Dan didn't have something for her she would go back to those places. She would get laid every night Jake was gone even if she had to hire a male escort! 

 She was just finishing her lunch when her cell phone beeped. It was Dan and he asked her to come to his office. When she got there Marci told her to go right on in. 

 "Your desk clear?" he asked when she walked into his office. 

 "I'm all caught up at the moment." 

 "Jared will be here this afternoon. I need you to run on home and dress for a cocktail party and dinner. When you get back I should have more information for you." 

 "A cocktail party? You think heels and a little black dress will do?" 

 "I think that would be perfect." 

 She had showered, shaved her legs, done her hair and make-up and was sitting on the bed rolling on a pair of nylons when her cell phone beeped. She answered it, put it on speaker phone and said hello as she continued to roll on her nylons. 

 "Hi honey" Jake said, "I'm in Atlanta and thank you for getting me to use my discount card. They did upgrade me to a suite." 

 "See? My job does have some benefits. Just do your best not to drink the wet bar dry." 

 "No worries there. I'll need to have a clear head when I go into the office tomorrow. I'll probably go to bed early so I'll be bright eyed and bushy tailed in the morning." 

 "Sounds like what I have planned" she said as she slipped on her 'come fuck me' pumps with the four inch heels. "I'll probably curl up with a good book and go to bed early." 

 "Oh? I thought you would take advantage of my being gone and go out with the girls after work." 

 "No thanks. Last time I did that one of the girls I was with got hit on by a guy who was with a buddy and she spent the next two hours trying to talk me into getting together with the buddy so she could go off with the guy trying to pick her up." 

 And if I knew then what I know now I would have done it she thought as she dug through a dresser drawer looking for her Spanish pearl thong. 

 "Well, I'm in room 815 if you need to reach me. I love you baby and I'll see you sometime Friday." 

 "Love you too" she said before disconnecting. As she slipped on her black dress she wondered just how early Jake would go to bed and whether he would be getting in that bed alone. She was glad she had gotten him to check into a hotel in their chain. If Dan's friend came through for her she would maybe have a better idea of the extent of Jake's cheating, but even if he went to bed alone every night he was in Atlanta it wouldn't change what he did at the beach. 

 She looked at herself in the mirror and wondered what she should wear as a necklace and then she smiled. "Silly girl," she thought, "It is just so obvious." She went to her jewelry box and got out a single strand of pearls. It should knock this Jared guy to his knees when her dress came off and he saw her standing there bra-less in her Spanish pearl thong with pearls around her neck. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was back in Dan's office at three and Marci took one look at her and shook her head as she said: 

 "I sure hope you know what you are doing." 

 Dan whistled and said, "I don't think I want to send you to Jared. I think I should keep you for myself." 

 She smiled and said, "I don't care just as long as I get laid." 

 "Damn, I am tempted, but I don't have time to find someone else for him. He will meet you in the lobby at four and I know it sounds corny, but he will be sitting there with a rose in his hand. That gives you almost an hour to kill. It would be bad form for me to send you to him to give him sloppy seconds, but just looking at you has given me a raging hard on. Feel up to giving me a blow job?" 

 "Since you ask so eloquently I don't see how I can say no." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As she entered the lobby she spotted him right away. Hard not to with the rose he was holding. When she saw him she had the same thought that she'd had when she saw Sam. What in the world was he doing paying for it? He could have gotten out of that chair, walked twenty feet to the lounge and had a woman hanging on his arm in minutes. God knows that if Dan hadn't come through for her and she had gone lounge shopping he was what she would have been looking for and hoping to get. 

 She walked over to him and said, "What a lovely rose. Did you pick it out just for me?" 

 "Well, I did pick it out for a lady named Fran." 

 "Then you must be Jared." 

 He smiled as he stood and handed her the rose. "You don't need to be careful in handling it; I trimmed all the thorns off with my pocket knife." 

 "How thoughtful of you." 

 "One never wants to cause a beautiful lady pain." 

 The cocktail party was at the Marriott and while she didn't know a soul there she did recognize several of the people who were in attendance. There was the Governor, the Mayor and two prominent city council members and Jared seemed to know them all. 

 She was introduced as Jared's personal assistant and all she had to do was hang on his arm and be admired. One man asked her what her duties were as Jared's personal assistant and she had smiled and said: 

 "Whatever it is that he wants done." 

 She saw Jared smile at that. 

 The cocktail party over Jared took her to Maxine's for dinner and while they sipped a before dinner drink they made small talk. The two things that did not come up in their conversation were why was he paying for feminine companionship and why was a nice girl like her selling her pussy. After dinner they went dancing at The Pit Stop and at eleven they were in his room at the hotel. 

 She walked over to the bed, turned to face him and then she released the clip that was holding her hair in place and shook her head. Her hair fell to her shoulders as she reached behind her to pull the zipper of her dress down. The dress fell to the floor and pooled around her ankles and she looked into his eyes as she kicked it away and stood before him in only heels, thigh highs and the Spanish pearl thong. 

 "My God" he said as he took in the sight, "You are magnificent." 

 She walked over to him and her hands went to his belt. She unbuckled it, undid the top button and pulled down his zipper. His pants fell away revealing a rather impressive looking tent in his boxers. She slid her hand down inside the waist band of his under-shorts and touched the head of his cock and he moaned and his cock throbbed. While she teased his cock head with her fingers he hurriedly removed all of his upper garments. He pushed her hands away and removed his underwear and he went to his knees in front of her. He slid her thong down her legs and as she stepped out of it he leaned forward and buried his face in her pussy. He pushed her legs apart and then went to work on her with his tongue. Heat coursed through her body and she moaned. He stood up, picked her up in his arms and set her down on the bed and then the two of them went to work in an effort to totally destroy the bed. 

 She left the room at 6 AM and went to her office and she didn't open the envelope Jared had given her until she was sitting at her desk. It contained twenty-five one hundred dollar bills. Twenty-five hundred dollars for what she would have happily done for free. As she looked at the bills she decided that she had to rent herself a safe deposit box. A checking account or a savings account, even at a different bank from the one she and Jake used, would generate paperwork, lead to monthly statements and open up the possibility for discovery. No way she wanted that - at least not for a while. 

 Knowing that she would be spending the night with Jared she had packed a small bag with the clothes she would wear to work and she picked up that bag and headed for the bathroom. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The morning flew by as she attacked the pile of paperwork on her desk and made phone calls to arrange deliveries for the two weddings she had coming up that weekend. 

 At two Dan called her and asked her to meet him in room 814. He was already naked when she got there and as she undressed Dan told her that Jared had really been impressed with her and wanted to use her exclusively whenever he came to town in the future. 

 "He even asked me to sound you out on the possibility that you might be able to fly to Chicago and spend some time with him occasionally." 

 "I wouldn't mind" she said as she stepped out of her panties, "but I don't see anyway that I could do it." 

 "Maybe we can work something out. I'll think on it." 

 "What are you getting out of this?" 

 "Doing favors for people who can someday return the favor." 

 "Do you ever get repaid?" 

 "Sometimes. I did you a favor and now here you are getting ready to help me with a stiffness I seemed to have developed." 

 "Well, I'm no massage therapist, but I will bet that I can make the swelling go down." 

 And she did. Twice. 

 That night as she was doing her laundry her cell phone rang and it was Dan wanting to know if she could take care of a friend of his the next afternoon and she said that she could. She spent five hours with a business man from Dayton and added $1200 to the money piling up in the safe deposit box. Thursday was an all-nighter with a lawyer from Kansas City and another $2000. 

 It amused her that Dan had a code of conduct he stuck to whenever he set her up for a date; he wouldn't fuck her that day, but he did insist on a blow job. She didn't care because every time she did it she was getting back at Jake. 

 Friday at ten Dan called her and asked her if she could take care of one of his friends from Boston and she said she would have to take a pass. 

 "I have the rehearsal dinner for the Cole wedding and Jake will be due back tonight." 

 Besides, she thought, she needed to fuck someone in the Cole wedding party to keep her string going. She wouldn't make any money on the deal, but meeting the goal she had set for herself was important to her. 

 At two Dan called her and asked her to come to his office. "My friend in Atlanta called me twenty minutes ago. It seems that your hunch was right on. Jake has had a woman in his room every night this week and it hasn't always been the same one." 

 "That makes it easier for me to do this" she said as she slipped off her panties, lifted her skirt to her waist and then bent forward over his desk. She looked back over her shoulder and smiled as Dan got off his chair and moved around behind her. 

 She moaned as his hard cock slid into her and she pushed back hard at him to get him in as deep as he could go. He took her waist in his hands and started fucking her hard as she moaned: 

 "Yes, yes, oh yes lover; fuck me, fuck me hard." 

 Dan fucked her steady for several minutes and then he said, "Here it comes baby, here it comes." 

 "Do it!" she cried, "Do it, do it, do it" and then she came just as Dan shot his wad into her. 

 Dan had just cum in her pussy and was standing behind her, his softening cock soaking in her wet heat when her cell phone beeped. She took it out of her pocket and answered it. It was Jake. 

 "It is going to be Monday before I finish up here honey. I can't see any sense in flying home tonight and then flying back here on Sunday." 

 "Well I won't pretend I'm happy about it, but you are right; it wouldn't make sense to fly home and then turn around and go right back." 

 While she was talking she stood up and Dan's cock slipped out and she turned and went to her knees in front of him. She took the limp dick in her hand and licked it and then said: 

 "Don't sweat it baby. I'll find something to keep me busy" and she gave Dan's cock another lick. "I do have two weddings going on this weekend and I can hover over them. It will keep me busy. And Dan has a special project for me to work on." 

 She opened her mouth and took Dan's cock in as Jake said, "I'll make it up to you honey. We will do something special next weekend. Maybe go on a dive." 

 She stopped sucking Dan's cock long enough to say, "That's okay baby, but I've got to go now. Something just came up. Call me as soon as you know when you will be home. Love you" and she swallowed Dan's cock as she disconnected. A minute later she was again bent forward over Dan's desk and moaning as Dan shoved his hard cock into her. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The rehearsal went off without a hitch. The only thing wrong with it was that the pickings were slim as far as meeting her goal was concerned. Everyone seemed to be paired up. She did see some interest on the faces of two of the ushers and on the face of the father of the bride, but all three seemed taken. 

 As everyone sat down for the rehearsal dinner she handed out the complimentary drink coupons and thought that it was too bad that she hadn't said yes when Dan asked her to take care of his friend from Boston. She would just have to hit the lounge and see if she could score there. She was sitting at the bar stirring her frozen margarita with the straw when someone slid onto the stool next to her. She glanced over and saw that it was the father of the bride. 

 "Off duty" he asked, "Or on duty and just sitting here to make sure that the comp tickets you handed out aren't abused?" 

 "Off duty and easing down from a long and tiring day." 

 He stuck out his hand and said, "I'm Vince." 

 "Fran" she said as she took his hand for a quick shake. 

 "So tell me" ha asked, "Are you allowed to associate with the customers when you are off duty?" 

 "What a strange question. Of course I can. What I do on my own time is my business." 

 "Not a strange question at all. Most of the bars and lounges I frequent at home have a rule that the help can't associate with the customers after hours at their place of employment unless it is on their day off." 

 "What a silly rule." 

 "Silly rule, but some blue-nosed city council members have been pushing for a law since it was discovered that some of the girls working at the stripper bars were meeting customers when they got off work to play for pay. Of course the law would cover all bars and not just stripper bars so the bar owners put the rule in place to try and diffuse the situation. How the hell did I get into that? All I wanted to do was find out if I could ask you to dance." 

 "Where is your wife?" 

 "Don't have one of those anymore." 

 "Oh? I thought that the woman sitting with you was your wife." 

 "That was my sister and she lives here and has already gone home." 

 "You are staying here in the hotel?" 

 "Through Sunday." 

 Just then the band started playing and she got off her stool, took his hand and said, "Shall we?" Once on the dance floor she moved in close to Vince and her leg felt the hard bulge inside his trousers. She looked up at his face and smiled as she said: 

 "Is dancing what you really want to do?" 

 "If you know enough to ask the question then you already know the answer." 

 "You staying here?" 

 "Room 304." 

 "Get your key ready" and she started leading him to the elevators. 

 It was pure fuck and suck until noon Saturday. They got to his room, stripped and then she had him eat her to get her wet and then they fucked. She sucked him hard and they fucked again. Next it was sixty-nine until he was hard and then he took her from behind. She had five good orgasms before he had to admit he couldn't get it up again, but she told him not to worry, that with some rest he would be good to go in the morning and he was. They fucked twice more before he had to get ready for the wedding which was at three. As she was leaving he thanked her and asked her if she would be around that night. 

 "Sorry. I only get the urge to be a slut once in a great while. Last night was probably it for the next couple of months. But it was fun. Have a good time at the wedding." She blew him a kiss and left. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was home soaking in the tub and thinking about where she was going to go lounge shopping that night when the phone rang. She picked up the cordless, answered and it was Dan. 

 "I know it is short notice sweetie, but something just came up and all of the other girls on my list are spoken for. Jake won't be home until Monday, right?" 

 "That's what he said although given what he is doing I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to get another day or two out of it. I won't know until Monday when he is supposed to call and let me know when he will be home."  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 05 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Can you spend the rest of the weekend with a fried of mine?" 

 "You know my goal Dan; to get laid every day that Jake is gone. Where and when?" 

 "Let me call him and let him know I can help him out and I'll call you right back." 

 Five minutes later Dan called her back. "He is sending a limo to pick you up. It will be there at three. He said dress for dinner and dancing tonight and pack casual for tomorrow and tomorrow night." 

 As she poked through her closet she thought about the possibilities. If Jake did come home Monday night and she did spend Sunday night with Jake's friend and if she did fuck Dan Monday afternoon she would be able to give Jake some very well used pussy Monday night. And she would insist that he eat her first. Damn! She wished she could give him her pussy full of cum. Some day! Some day she would feed him another man's leavings, but she wasn't near ready to do that. 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 06 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© As Jake's tongue slid into her pussy she lay there looking up at the ceiling and thinking of the last forty-eight hours. Saturday she had been wined and dined and then taken to a luxury condo on Steven's Lake and thoroughly fucked by Harvey (Dan's friend) and then on Sunday she had hung on Harvey's arm as he visited the Museum of Modern Art and then the Museum of Natural History. 

 On the way back to his condo Harv had had the limo driver put up the partition and then he had taken her on the back seat of the limo. When he was spent and she lay there looking up at him with heavy-lidded and lust filled eyes he had said: 

 "You didn't cum and I won't be ready again for a while. Do you want the driver?" 

 "The driver?" 

 "Yes, the driver. 

 She had surprised herself when without even thinking she said, "It doesn't matter what I want; I'm on your time." 

 Harv had smiled down at her and had said, "So you are my sweet, so you are" and he had rapped on the partition to get the driver's attention. She had blown the driver and then had fucked him while Harv had driven the limo. At the condo Harv had invited the driver to come in and that night she had experienced her first double penetration as Harv shoved his cock down her throat and the driver had fucked her from behind. In college she had done five guys at a frat house mixer, but it had been one at a time and she had never before had two at once. 

 The driver left and Harv fucked her one more time before they fell asleep together. In the morning he fucked her again and then he told her he wanted to fuck her in her own bed. It was the one thing that she never intended to do and she had told him no, but then he had thrown her words back at her: 

 "It doesn't matter what you want because you are on my time, remember?" 

 When they reached the house Harv had again invited the limo driver to join them and the two men had taken turns on her on Jake's bed most of the night. In the morning Harv had placed an envelope on the dresser, in almost the same spot where Jake's wallet and wrist watch now rested, and had said: 

 "You were worth every cent of it my sweet." 

 When he was gone she had looked in the envelope and had found fifty brand new one hundred dollar bills. Five thousand dollars for the most sexually satisfying weekend of her life. Five grand and two more entries into her notebook, "And I owe it all to you" she thought as she looked up at her husband. 

 She smiled and said, "Fuck me baby. Enough foreplay for now. I want you in my pussy." 

 "Yeah asshole" she thought as he lifted his mouth from her pussy and moved up on her, "Put your cock in my well used cunt." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Dan had been out of town on Monday and when she saw him on Tuesday he told her that she had gotten rave reviews from his friend Harvey. 

 "He's busy today, but he wants you for the rest of the week." 

 "Do you know what that means?" 

 "No, what?" 

 "You will have to settle for blow jobs if you stick to your policy of sending me off to your friends without any of you in me." 

 "So? There isn't anything wrong with blow jobs, but I did say that he was busy today and that means I won't have to settle for your mouth today." 

 "Now? Over the desk?" 

 "Not now, but only because I have a lot that I have to get done. I'll give you a call sometime this afternoon." 

 As she was leaving the office Marci stopped her and asked her if she would have lunch with her and she said she would. The morning was busy as she worked on coordinating the events she had going on that week. She also had two weddings for the weekend, Closman on Friday evening and McMartin on Saturday. She did occasionally wonder why Marci wanted to have lunch with her, but didn't spend too much time thinking on it since she would know in a couple of hours. 

 She got to the restaurant and found that Marci was already there. She sat down, ordered her customary salad with a glass of iced tea and then waited for Marci to speak. At first it was just small talk about the hotel and office politics, but she knew that Marci had something else she wanted to talk about and was working up to it. Finally, just after the waiter brought her the salad she'd ordered, Marci blurted out: 

 "Dan asked me if I would be interested in sleeping with a friend of his." 

 "Why in the world would he do that?" 

 "Because I talk to him a lot and he knows the situation I'm in as far as my husband is concerned." 

 "And that is?" 

 "I found out he has been cheating on me. Dan wanted to know if I wanted to get even with my husband and I asked how and he said that I could do what my husband was doing. I thought Dan was asking me to sleep with him to get back at my husband and I told him no, that I didn't believe that affairs with co- workers was a good idea. That is when he said he didn't mean with him, but that he had a friend who needed a date for a cocktail party and then for some fun after. I told him I couldn't do something like that and he asked why not and I said because it wouldn't be right." 

 "And I bet I know what Dan said then. He said, "But what your husband is doing is?" 

 "Yep; that is what he said and then he told me I should talk with you." 

 "Talk to me? Whatever for?" 

 "He said it worked for you so maybe it would work for me and then he said that maybe you could give me some insight." 

 "I don't know what to say; what to tell you." 

 "Are you doing what he asked me to do?" 

 She thought for a moment and then she said, "Yes Marci I am, but I still have no idea of what to tell you. I don't know anything about you and your husband so I don't know what to say." 

 "Why would that make a difference?" 

 "I'm doing what I do because I found out that Jake was cheating on me and I'm doing it to get back at him. I can do it because once I found out he was a cheating bastard I washed my hands of him. The love is gone. So is the 'like'. I pretend that everything is fine between us so he will support me while I stab him in the back every chance I get. I don't know that what I'm doing would work for you. You might still love your husband and be willing to forgive him after having a revenge affair and in that case what I'm doing is something you probably shouldn't. 

 "Also, I have no way of knowing if you are the type of girl who could just go out and have sex with strangers. I can do it because more than anything I want to hurt the bastard I'm married to. I want to bed as many as I can before he finds out and then I will glory in telling him how long I've been doing it and with how many and how much I enjoyed it. And then I'll let him know that every time he had sex with me it was just after some other man had just had me." 

 "Oh I can do it all right. I was pretty wild in college and I'm no stranger to having sex with guys I've just met. Like you, I've washed my hands of the cheating asshole, but I hadn't thought about staying with him and letting him support me. I was just going to go for a divorce. I think I like your idea better. What do you do?" 

 She explained to Marci about the envelopes that she was handed at the end of her dates. 

 "So you are a call girl?" 

 "Yes, I guess I am, but so what? That just gets me the men I need to get my revenge on Jake. And, if you like sex, you usually end up satisfied with money in your purse and a check mark on the revenge chart." 

 "I guess you have given me something to think about and I do like the idea of building up a slush fund against the day I leave Frank." 

 At three-thirty Dan called her and asked her to meet him in room 412. He was already naked and on the bed when she used her master key card to let herself into the room. As she was undressing Dan said: 

 "I understand that Marci talked to you today." 

 "We had a little chat over lunch." 

 "She has decided that she is going to do what you are doing. How would you feel about a double date with her?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Harvey's son will be getting in tomorrow morning for the wedding and Harvey wanted me to get a girl for him." 

 "Whoa up there boss. What wedding, and have you forgotten that I can only do afternoons as long as Jake is in town?" 

 Dan gave her a funny look and then said, "You don't know? You really don't know?" 

 "Know what?" 

 "I thought Harvey would have mentioned it to you. His son is Robert McMartin and it is his wedding that you have been working on. That's why Harvey is here, for the wedding." 

 "He never mentioned it to me." 

 "Did he also not mention that he owns the company that your husband works for?" 

 "No he didn't. He never said a word about it to me." 

 "I told him about your situation and why you are doing what you are doing. He knows that you aren't a pro and are only going with the guys I set you up with to get back at your husband. Like I said, Harv is quite taken with you and wants to see a lot more of you so this is what is going to happen. Jake will probably be bubbling over when he gets home tonight. It seems that the owner of the company was so impressed with the work Jake did when he was out of town last week that he requested Jake for a special project. Jake will be flying to Tampa tomorrow and he will be gone at least until next Wednesday which, strangely enough, is when Harv has to return to Los Angeles. Is the picture a little clearer now?" 

 "Crystal." 

 "And since Harv comes to town two or three times a month I would figure on Jake traveling at least that often." 

 "Oh damn! Doesn't that just break my heart. But back to the double date. His son is getting married on Saturday and Harv is setting him up with a hooker?" 

 "High class call girl." 

 "Whatever." 

 "What can I say? Some father and son bonding? A last fling before settling down? I don't know and it isn't any of my business so I'm not asking." 

 "Can Marci get out at night?" 

 "She says she can. So, do you have any objection?" 

 "No. As long as Jake is out of town I can do it, but I'll have to be honest; it just doesn't make any sense to me that he is paying as much as he does when he could walk into any lounge in town and the ladies would swarm over him." 

 "I can't answer that one either except to say that the rich are different than the rest of us. I guess when you have millions it doesn't matter how much you spend or what you spend it on if it gets you what you want." 

 "Are you sure about this? About Jake going out of town?" 

 "Reasonably sure. He could always refuse to go, but how likely is that?" 

 "Not very. What about Marci? How does she feel about this double date idea?" 

 "She likes it. She likes the idea of some one she knows being along on her first time out." 

 When she entered the room Dan's cock had been rock hard and pointing straight up at the ceiling and now it was limp and lying on his thigh. She pointed at it and asked: 

 "Has it lost interest in me or has the conversation been that boring?" 

 "It is just resting and storing up energy for what is about to happen. I'm sure that you know how to make it suitable for use." 

 "I wouldn't be the least bit surprised" she said as she joined him on the bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was in the kitchen fixing dinner when she heard the front door open and then close and Jake holler out, "Honey, I'm home." 

 "Big fucking deal" she thought as she yelled back, "I'm in the kitchen." 

 Jake came into the room all smiles and he walked over to her, hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. "I've got some great news babe. Actually, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the company is finally recognizing my talents. The bad news is that the recognition is going to mean that I have to go out of town again." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "The work I did last week in Atlanta caught the eye of somebody higher up in the company and he requested me specifically to take care of a problem in Tampa. The really bad news is that I have to leave in the morning and I'll be gone until the middle of next week." 

 "But you just got home from a week of being gone." 

 "I know honey, and I'm no happier about it than you are, but it is an opportunity for me to shine and that could lead to a promotion and more money." 

 "But it isn't fair to me. I need you here baby. I just don't feel right when you are gone." 

 "I'll make it up to you babe." 

 "That's what you told me last week. You were supposed to take me diving this week, remember?" 

 "I know I did, but this is too good an opportunity to pass up. If I do a good job I could end up a regional manager or maybe even a vice-president and then I wouldn't have to travel at all," 

 "Oh sure. With our luck you will do such a damned good job that they will keep you doing it." 

 "Oh come on baby; this could turn out good for us in the long run." 

 It is going to turn out damned good for me she was thinking as she said, "You'll have your work cut out for you tonight then, because you are going to have to give me enough to hold me until you get back home." 

 "I'll do my best babe. Why don't we skip dinner and start now?" 

 She smiled as she thought about his mouth being on her pussy only two hours after Dan's cock had been there and she said: 

 "Race you!" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She and Marci had showered and dressed in one of the vacant rooms for their evening out with the McMartins, father and son, and Harvey's limo had picked them up in front of the hotel. She had given Tony a big smile as a way of letting him know she remembered the nice fucking he had given her the last time they had seen each other. She saw his look at Marci and she knew he was wondering if he might get a taste of her. She didn't know, but all things were possible she supposed. 

 As they rode across town o the country club where they would meet the McMartins she asked Marci: 

 "Are you nervous?" 

 "A little. Frank has been the only man in my life for the last twelve years. There could have been others - God knows I've had the opportunities - but I have been faithful to Frank until now." 

 "Just think back to when you were dating. That is all this is you know; just a date. The only difference is that back then the guy was always hoping he would score and this time he knows he will. Treat the guy like he is the man you want to spend the rest of your life with. Relax and enjoy it and go home with a smile on your face knowing that you've gotten back at your hubby and had fun doing it. You never said, is this a one time thing and then you are going home and rub Frank's nose in it?" 

 "I'd thought about that, but then I decided I like your idea better. Let the bastard support me while I hang horns on him." 

 "I should warn you; things might get a little kinky if you let it." 

 "How do you mean?" 

 She told Marci about the night Harv had shared her with his driver Tony. You did him AND the limo driver? The one up front now?" 

 "Yep, and what's more I loved it, but I could have said no and Harvey would have accepted my no. It was my choice." 

 "I don't know if I could do something like that. I've never done more than one since my senior prom." 

 "Oh you slut you. How many did you do?" 

 "Four. I got really wasted that night and I probably would have done more, but my date finally found me and got me away from the party." 

 "He didn't like sharing?" 

 "Hell, he didn't even get any. He wasn't one of the four. In fact he'd never gotten more than a kiss from me during the four months we dated. I never heard from him again after that night." 

 Just then the limo pulled up in front of the country club. She looked over at Marci. "Are you ready?" 

 "As ready as I'll ever be." 

 "Then let's do it" and the two of them got out of the limo as Tony held the door for them. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 "Oh yes, fuck me, deeper damn it, deeper. Fuck me hard lover; fuck me like you mean it" came the cry from the next room. 

 She took her mouth off of his cock long enough to say, "She sure is a noisy bitch" and he laughed. 

 "If she wants it harder and deeper I'm sure that dad will oblige her." 

 As she went back to sucking Bobby McMartin's cock she thought back on the night and how she had come to be on her knees and sucking the cock of Marci's date for the evening. 

 They had arrived at the country club and the hostess had taken them to a table that had been reserved for Harvey and then she had informed them that Mr. McMartin had called and said he was running a few minutes late. She and Marci had ordered a drink and were sitting there talking when Marci exclaimed: 

 "Oh my God!" 

 "What?" 

 "He's here. My Dream Man - my fantasy man - just walked in." 

 She had turned to look and when she turned back she asked, "Which one?" 

 "The one in the blue suit." 

 "Well then girlfriend, you are both lucky and unlucky." 

 "How is that?" 

 "You are lucky because unless I miss my guess he is your date for the evening. You are unlucky because if he is your date for the evening he is getting married Saturday." 

 Just then Harvey and a younger version of Harvey walked up to the table. After the introductions were out of the way there had been dinner, drinks and dancing before Tony drove them to the condo on Stevens Lake. Once inside Harv had said, "You two have fun" to Bobby and Marci and then he had led her to his bedroom. When the door had closed behind them he had asked her if she was wearing pantyhose or thigh highs. 

 "Neither. Nylons and a garter belt." 

 "Are you wearing anything bought for you by your husband?" 

 "Everything. The only thing he didn't pay for was my having my hair done for you today." 

 "Are you wearing it because you knew you were going to be fucking another man tonight?" 

 "Why else?" 

 "Good. Just take off your panties. I want to do you while you are still wearing everything that he paid for." 

 She had stepped out of her panties and he had asked her to hand them to him. "I'll use them to wipe my cock when I'm done." 

 "How do you want me?" 

 "First time just bend forward over the bed, brace yourself with your hands and spread your legs." 

 She did what he wanted and he moved in behind her. He didn't waste anytime on foreplay because he knew she would be soaking wet in anticipation and she was. He slid deep into her with his first stroke and she moaned as he bottomed out. He grabbed her hips and started fucking her and she shoved back at him and hissed: 

 "Fuck me honey, fuck me hard. Fuck my married cunt so I can hang another horn on my husband." 

 "I will baby, I will. I love fucking married women. I love making them into my sluts." 

 "Do it lover, do it. Make me your slut" she gasped as he slammed his cock into her. 

 He fucked her hard for several minutes and brought her to her first orgasm of the evening before shooting his load into her and then he pulled out and had her sit on the edge of the bed and suck him hard again. Once hard he pushed her legs apart and mounted her. The second time was a lot longer than the first time and she came three times before he gave her his second load. 

 While they were resting up they heard Marci begging Bobby to make her cum. Harv laughed and said, "Boy is she ever loud. Dan told me that this is her first time." 

 "Yep, and she is doing it for the same reason I am." 

 "Wonder if she would like to be added to the list of married woman I've fucked." 

 "Nasty old man! That's your son's date." 

 "I'll be fair about it; I'll give him you." 

 "You really are a nasty old man. You should be ashamed of yourself. Sending your own son sloppy seconds." 

 "It's only fair; I'll be getting his. Besides, I can see it in your eyes that you like the idea." 

 "Well you did say you wanted me to be your slut." 

 "Yes I did, didn't I. Well then, let us go see if Bobby is willing." 

 Bobby was and now Marci was screaming at Harvey to fuck her harder and she was on her knees sucking Bobby's cock. Bobby fucked her twice before switching again with his dad who did her one more time before Marci said she needed to leave and get home to her husband.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 06 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Since your husband is out of town you can stay right?" Harvey asked her. 

 "I can as long as you realize that I do have to go to work in the morning." 

 "How about it Bobby? Would you like her to stay?" 

 Bobby reached down and stroked his rapidly growing cock, smiled and moved towards her. She laughed and said, "I'll take that as a yes." 

 When Harvey walked back into the room after walking Marci out to the limo Bobby already had her on her hands and knees and was fucking her from behind. Harvey walked up to her and dangled his limp cock in front of her and she opened her mouth and took his cock in. Bobby came in her and said he was done for the night and he left for one of the other bedrooms. Harvey moved from her mouth to her pussy and gave her her umpteenth orgasm of the night before he shot into her and then the two of them fell asleep together. 

 She woke up at five forty-five with Bobby sucking on her tits and Harvey working on her clit with his thumb and as soon as she was fully awake the two men fucked her one time each and then headed for the shower. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 On the ride into work in the morning Harvey asked her how many men she had done at one time. She thought back to her college days and the kegger where she'd done the gangbang and then told Harvey that she had done five. "Why" she asked. 

 I'm putting a bachelor party for Bobby tonight and I was going to bring in the traditional stripper, but I think I'd rather have you do it." 

 "Why me?" 

 "Because you are a married woman cheating on her husband and that is such a turn on for me. Just thinking of you getting gangbanged will keep me hard all day." 

 "I've never done a strip before; I wouldn't know how." 

 "What I want you for comes after you take your clothes off. Just undress while you sway to the music, toss your clothes to the guys and smile suggestively." 

 "How many will be there?" 

 "Just the wedding party. There will be the six ushers, the best man, the father and brother of the bride, Bobby and me." 

 "Whoa! The father and brother of the bride?" 

 "Jimmy and I grew up together. Our families were close and we stayed tight even after we grew up and then after we both married we stayed close. Bobby and Jimmy's daughter Pam pretty much grew up together. Anyway, tonight won't be the first time that Jimmy and I have been to a gangbang together. As far as Rick is concerned, he and Bobby were frat brothers in college. Only God and the two of them know what they have done together." 

 "This one of those families that play together stay together things?" 

 "I guess you could put it that way." 

 "To be honest Harv, I don't know if I can do that many." 

 "How about if I can get you another girl to help?" 

 "I could do it I suppose." 

 "Good. I'll talk to Dan this morning and arrange for another girl. But if he can't get one will you still do it?" 

 "I'll try, but don't get upset with me if I can't do all of them. I'll try my best, but no promises." 

 He kissed her before she got out of the limo and told her that he would see her that night. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As she walked to her office she thought about what Harvey wanted her to do and the more she thought about it the more she liked the idea. Her goal from the beginning was to fuck some one from every wedding she worked. She now realized that the goal had been a little un-realistic; there was no way she could do it when she had multiple weddings on a weekend and she had settled for doing at least one. She had never even remotely imagined doing an entire wedding party at one time. The only down side was that Jake wouldn't be there for her to go home to when it was over. But maybe that was a good thing. She remembered how loose she was after the five guys at the frat party. Jake would surely notice how loose she was after eleven. 

 She had another thought as she sat down at her desk. Harvey hadn't given her an envelope when he dropped her off. Should she say something to Dan about it? She decided to wait and see what happened that evening. 

 She got a call from Marci at eleven asking her to meet Marci for lunch. Marci was all smiles as she walked up to the table and sat down. As soon as they had ordered Marci said: 

 "You were right. I felt so damned good sitting across from Frank at breakfast this morning, smiling at him and remembering what I had done. Which, by the way, was fantastic. All I thought about on the way to work was when can I do it again. And when I looked in the envelope that Harvey put in my purse when he walked me to the limo I almost fainted! Two thousand dollars! Two thousand dollars and all I did was enjoy myself." 

 "I'm glad you liked it." 

 "Like it? Honey, I loved it and like I said, all the way into work all I could think about was doing it again. And that's my problem. Dan wants me to do it again tonight." 

 "Where's the problem?" 

 "He wants me to go with you to a bachelor party and he said that there may be as many as a dozen men there. To me that says I'll be pulling a train." 

 "And that's a problem for you? Didn't you tell me that you pulled one after your prom?" 

 "Yes, but it was only four and I was drunk out of my mind that time." 

 "You had no problem with being passed around last night" 

 "Yes, but that was only two. I don't know about a dozen." 

 "Think of it this way. I'll be there doing half and you will be doing the other half and that is only two more than you did after your prom." 

 "Still, that's a big step for me to take Fran." 

 "Yes, I imagine that it is, but think about how good it will feel to smile at you husband, kiss him and let him make love to you while all the time you are thinking about how many strange cocks that you let use the pussy that he thinks is his and his alone." 

 "When you put it that way I can see the appeal. But what if I get started and then after a couple I decide I can't do any more?" 

 "Then you don't. I told Harvey I would try to do them all if he couldn't get me some help, but that I might not be able to handle them all and he was fine with it." 

 "Harvey? What does Harvey have to do with it?" 

 "Dan didn't tell you? It is Bobby's bachelor party." 

 "Bobby? My Dream Man? I'm in, but I get to do him first!" 

 "Deal" she said as she reached for Marci's hand and shook it. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 07 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© The bachelor party was being held at Harvey's condo on the lake and he had sent his limo to pick her and Marci up when they got off work. They got to the condo almost an hour before the guests would start arriving. Marci and Bobby were off somewhere, probably fucking, and she and Harvey were sitting on the leather sofa in the den. She was looking out the window at the lake when Harvey said: 

 "A penny for your thoughts." 

 She turned to him, smiled and said, "They aren't worth that much." 

 "Maybe so, but you were somewhere else just now and I'm curious." 

 "I was thinking about how this is all going to turn out for me." 

 "In what way?" 

 "I'm doing what I'm doing to get back at him for cheating on me. My plan was to continue to let him support me in the style to which I have become accustomed while I hung horns on him. I had hoped that it would go on for years, but then you came along and now I don't know how things are going to work out." 

 "What has my coming along got to do with it?" 

 "You being Jake's boss changes things. By sending Jake out on special projects to get him out of the way so you can play with me you have made him think that he is going places in the company; that his worth is finally being realized and that possible promotions are on the horizon." 

 "So?" 

 "What is going to happen when sooner or later I'm no longer the flavor of the month and you drop me? Jake's trips will stop; he will come to realize that he isn't going anywhere with the company and his ego will drive him to quit and go looking for some other company that will appreciate him. When that happens my comfortable existence will go into the toilet because there are not that many jobs out there that pay what Jake is making now and he isn't likely to find one. He will have to start over and work his way up and that translates into a lower standard of living for me." 

 "First off, what makes you think that I'll get tired of you?" 

 "You said it yourself. You enjoy turning married women into your sluts. I think it is fairly safe to say that you have accomplished that with me. You got me to do Tony, have a mini orgy with you and your son and tonight I'll be pulling a train for you. If that doesn't make me a slut I don't know what will." 

 "So?" 

 "So I expect that now you will go looking for another married woman to turn into a slut. Don't get me wrong here lover; I didn't and don't expect anything long-term. When Dan set me up with you it was just another date. It still is just another date, but it has turned into a date with complications." 

 "I don't recall saying that I went from married woman to married woman turning them into sluts. What I remember saying was that I loved turning married women into my sluts. And here you are. Just what I want. Why would I stop seeing you now that you are just what I like? Secondly, I didn't get where I am in business by being stupid and making silly mistakes and bad errors of judgment. Your husband is very good at what he does and if I never saw you again after tonight he would still be working for me and he will get promoted. He has been under consideration for some time now and it was going to happen eventually. My meeting you and finding out about you has speeded it up a little, but it is going to happen. 

 "But I can tell you now that the job he is likely to get promoted into will be a traveling job. You will still have your standard of living and you will have the luxury of him being gone a lot of the time and that will allow you to do what it is you want to do. So don't waste your time worrying. If push came to shove and for some reason he did quit you could leave him and I'd set you up in your own place as my mistress." 

 "I can't leave him. I'm nowhere near ready o leave him. I haven't hung enough horns on him yet." 

 "Well then, since you are my slut I guess I'll have to see to it that you get all the cocks that your little heart desires so you can collect horns. Do you have a magic number - a goal to reach?" 

 "No. The length of time I do it is just as important to me as the number of men. A dozen a year for ten years or a hundred in five years, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that when I finally let him know it is sufficient to rock him to his core." 

 Before any more was said the doorbell rang as the first of the guests started arriving. She and Marci started out the evening acting as hostesses while the men played cards. They kept the chip and dip bowls full and fetched drinks when the glasses and the beer bottles got empty. About two hours into the party Harvey came up to her and told her that it was time. She walked over to the sound systems and hit player and the CD she had placed in the changer started to play. 

 She and Marci moved into the middle of the room and she pulled a chair from one of the card tables and placed it in the middle of the room. She pointed a finger at Bobby and crooked it in a "come here" sign and all the guys hooted and hollered as Bobby moved forward and sat down. Then she danced over to Marci and took Marci's blouse off of her and tossed it out to the crowd. Marci did a twirl around her and removed her blouse and threw it out to the yelling men. As the music played the two of them danced and twirled around and undressed each other until they were both down to thigh highs and high heels and then the two of them strutted over to where Bobby was sitting in the chair and Marci went to her knees in front of him. 

 There was no lap dance - this was a gangbang and Marci had a time limit - and as Marci was removing Bobby's slacks and boxers she started removing his shirt. Once it was off she stuck her right breast in Bobby's mouth and he started to suck on it while Marci captured his cock with her mouth and went to work on it. Someone moved up behind her and fingers felt for her pussy. She spread her legs and the fingers went into her and began to finger fuck her. A voice said: 

 "She's already wet and ready for it." 

 She heard a zipper go down and seconds later the fingers were removed and a hard cock took their place. She bent at the waist and with her hands bracing her on the back of Bobby's chair she moved her feet a little farther apart and the cock went in deeper. 

 Marci had Bobby's cock hard by then and she stood up and straddled him with her back to him and then she slid down on his erection. She started to ride him and Jimmy, the bride's father, stepped forward and aimed his cock at Marci's mouth. She smiled at him and then opened her mouth and swallowed the head of his dick. 

 The man fucking her from behind slammed hard into her and flooded her pussy with his discharge and then pulled out and was immediately replaced by someone else. Someone moved in front of her and she looked up and saw that it was Harvey. He smiled at her and pushed his cock at her mouth and she opened her mouth and took it and then Harvey and the man behind her buffeted her between them until the man behind her came in her and pulled out. Another man moved in behind her and her third cock of the evening entered her. Harvey came in her mouth and his place was taken by one of the ushers. 

 By then Marci had taken Bobby's load and Jimmy had cum in her mouth. When she got up from Bobby's lap one of the ushers took her by the hand and led her off to one of the bedrooms and three other men followed along behind. 

 As she watched Marci being led away the man behind her came and when he pulled away from her the best man moved to take his place. His cock slid into her and as he stroked into her he started working on her butt hole with his fingers. She was going through an orgasm and didn't notice, but when she did she went to pull her mouth off of the usher's dick to say no. The usher, feeling her start to pull off, grabbed her head and held it in place as he started shooting into her mouth. The best man, not hearing a no from her, started pushing his cock at her ass. By the time she had finished gulping and swallowing the cum from the usher the best man already had his cock started in her ass. She was no stranger to anal sex and the best man went slow and easy so even though she would have preferred not to be taken in the butt she relaxed and let it happen. 

 After the best man came in her ass someone else took his place and then another and then another and another until she found herself with a cock in her ass, her pussy and her mouth. She lost track of who, what and how many times. She was only vaguely aware of Marci coming up to her and saying that she had to go in order to beat Frank home, but with a mouthful of cock she couldn't say anything. 

 She was picked up and carried into one of the bedrooms and then they came at her one, two and three at a time until they couldn't get it up anymore and left her. She fell asleep totally exhausted. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When Harvey dropped her off in front of the hotel in the morning he kissed her and told her that the memory of the previous night was going to keep him hard all day and that he was looking forward to spending some time alone with her after the rehearsal dinner. Then he said: 

 "I know you are wondering about your envelope. Don't you worry about it. I plan on giving it to you before I leave which I'm hoping won't be until Tuesday morning." 

 "I don't know that I will ever understand it Harv, but it blows my mind that you are paying me for what you could get for free. You are handsome, fun to be with and God knows you do spoil a girl." 

 "I have my reasons sweetie and I'm comfortable with them. See you tonight." 

 She got a call from Marci at nine. "Dan wants to see you in his office. No rush; his day is pretty much open." 

 "I don't have much going on right now so I'll see you in a minute or so." 

 The first thing she noticed when she got to Dan's office was that Marci wasn't her usual chipper self. Before she could ask if something was wrong Marci said: 

 "Go right in; he is expecting you." 

 She walked into Dan's office and he looked up from what he was working on and smiled. 

 "Here she is - my star!" 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "It means that you have earned me the undying gratitude of one of my best friends. Harv can't stop raving about you. I'll be able to collect favors from him for the rest of my life. But that isn't why I called you for you." 

 He handed her a package and said, "Here, this is for you." 

 "What is it?" 

 "Remember asking if it would be possible to have someone keep an eye on Jake while he was in Atlanta?" 

 "Yes." 

 "You said you didn't need pictures or anything like that; you just wanted to know for sure what he did away from home. Well, my friend in Atlanta made a copy of the security tape from the cameras on your husband's floor. It shows him going into his room with a woman at 11:30 one night and her leaving the next morning at 6:10. As an added bonus it shows him standing naked in the doorway kissing her goodbye." 

 "Thanks Dan; I owe you one." 

 "And I will collect. But not now. Run along sweetie, I've got a ton of stuff to do." 

 As she left Dan's office she stopped at Marci's desk and asked her if she was feeling all right. 

 "About as well as anyone whose life is in the toilet." 

 "Was last night that bad for you?" 

 "Oh no, there was nothing wrong with last night; in fact, last night was great except for Bobby seeing me being a cock-hungry slut." 

 "So why all of a sudden is your life in the toilet?" 

 "I find the man of my dreams only I'm already married and he is going to be. And even if I weren't and he wasn't he saw me being a slut." 

 "Oh come on Marci; he's a customer, a date." 

 "Fran, I know it sounds silly, but Bobby is the man I was meant to have. I knew it the instant I saw him walk toward us at the country club that night. It sucks Fran. Even if I could dump Frank overnight Bobby would still be married before I could get to him. And even if he wasn't he wouldn't want the slut he saw me being." 

 "I don't know about that. It could be a case of like father like son and I know for a fact that daddy is hooked on sluts." 

 "It doesn't matter Fran; he is out of my reach and that's a bummer." 

 "Tell you what. Why don't you stick around after work and we can pretend you are my assistant when I work the rehearsal dinner. Maybe we can arrange for you to have one last shot at him before he goes down the aisle tomorrow." 

 "You think there might be a chance?" 

 "Don't get your hopes up, but you never know." 

 The rehearsal went off without a hitch and when it was over and everyone was heading for the rehearsal dinner Harvey pulled her aside and told her he had some business to take care of an she should relax in the lounge until he was able to get free. She let Marci hand out the complimentary drink coupons which would give her an opportunity to have a few words with Bobby. 

 She didn't feel like sitting in the lounge waiting for Harvey so she went to her office and got some of her paperwork out of the way. While she worked she wondered if she would ever again feel what Marci was feeling for Bobby. She had felt that way once - with Jake - but that was gone. She hoped it wouldn't be too hard for Marci to put Bobby behind her. She would have to talk to Dan and see if he couldn't use Marci a little more often. Maybe quantity would help her forget quality. 

 She looked at her watch. Harv might be ready so she locked her office and headed for the lounge. Harv wasn't there, but most of the McMartin wedding party was. She looked around, but she didn't see Bobby or Marci and she hoped that Marci had gotten her last chance. 

 Someone slid onto the bar stool next to her and she glanced over and saw Pam, the bride to be. "Buy you a drink" Pam asked. 

 "Thanks for the gesture, but mine are always on the house." 

 "I want to thank you for all that you've done. Everything has just been so perfect. May I ask you a question?" 

 "Sure, go ahead." 

 "Is Bobby any good in bed?" 

 "I beg your pardon?" 

 "A little birdie told me that you were the entertainment at his bachelor party." 

 "Who told you that?" 

 "One of the ushers and it was confirmed by the best man. I'm asking if he is any good as a lover." 

 "You don't know?" 

 "No I don't. Why would you think I would?" 

 "He didn't get to be as good as he is without a lot of practice and no offense, but you do not look like a virgin." 

 "I'm not, but Bobby and I have never done it." 

 "Dare I ask how the best man and one of the ushers know you well enough to tell you who Bobby makes it with?" 

 "I told you I wasn't a virgin." 

 "You aren't a virgin and you and Bobby aren't doing it. Does that mean you have been telling Bobby you were saving yourself for marriage?" 

 "No. I've tried to get him to make love to me, but he always finds a way not to." 

 "That doesn't make any sense. You are one hell of a sexy looking lady and Bobby loves to fuck." 

 "Just not me." 

 "Like I said, that just doesn't make any sense." 

 "Bobby and I grew up together. Our families are close and Bobby and I got thrown together a lot. Our families took vacations together, spent the holidays together and I'm afraid that Bobby sees me as a sister." 

 "Then why is he marrying you?" 

 "Because it is expected of him. There has never been any doubt in my fathers mind or Bobby's father's mind that Bobby and I would marry. Bobby will do whatever his father wants." 

 "And you will do what your father wants?" 

 "No." 

 "No? Then why are you going through with the wedding?" 

 "Because I love Bobby. I've loved him since I was seven years old." 

 "Does he know?" 

 "I've told him a hundred times, but he still thinks of me as a sister." 

 "Then you have to show him that you are not his sister." 

 "How do I do that?" 

 "How bad do you want him?" 

 "Bad enough to do whatever I have to do." 

 "Can you be a slut? I mean a real get down and be dirty slut?" 

 "I did the usher and the best man together this afternoon. Is that slutty enough?" 

 "Here is the sixty-four dollar question - do you want him bad enough that you will gamble on taking a chance that might just cause you to lose him if it goes bad?" 

 Pam was silent as she thought about it and then she said, "I don't have him now and a ring on my finger won't stop him from thinking of me as a sister so yes, I might as well take a chance if there is some hope of winning." 

 "Okay then, I may be able to help, but you are really going to have to be an absolute slut. I can't impress that on you enough. You WILL have to be an absolute slut." 

 "I can do it." 

 "All right then; here is what we are going to do." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When Harvey showed up and asked her if she was ready to go she asked; 

 "Where is Bobby?" 

 "He is in a room upstairs with Marci." 

 "I want him to go with us and I want the both of you to come home with me. I want you both on my husband's bed and I want to be Bobby's last before he says I do." 

 "What about Marci?" 

 "She can come to if she doesn't have to go home." 

 But Marci did have to go home so it was just Harvey and Bobby in the limo with her on the ride to her house. The partition was down and Tony was watching in the rear view mirror as she sucked Harvey's cock while Bobby fucked her from behind. When they pulled into her drive Bobby was almost ready to cum so they stayed in the limo until he blew his load into her. Then, as she pulled up her panties she said: 

 "I feel real slutty tonight; can Tony join us?" 

 "How about it Tony" Harvey asked, "Would you like another taste of her?" 

 "You bet Mr. McMartin." 

 "Then come on inside with us" and the four of them got out of the limo and headed into the house. Once in the bedroom and undressed she took charge. 

 "I want Tony in my mouth" she said to Harvey, "And you and Bobby can decide who gets my pussy and who gets my ass." She climbed on the king sized bed and said, "Come on guys, we are wasting time here." 

 Tony had his fingers in her hair as he fucked her face while she rode Harvey's cock and Bobby was sliding his cock in her ass and the sounds of sex were bouncing off the walls of the bedroom when a voice said: 

 "Damn it! You weren't supposed to start without me." 

 All heads turned and looked toward the doorway where Pam stood in all of her naked glory. She pulled her head off Tony's cock and said: 

 "Sorry; I was really horny. Which one do you want?" 

 "Well, I've been trying to give it to Bobby for years, but he wouldn't take it so I'm thinking he can wait until after the ceremony tomorrow. I don't know if I'm quite ready for daddy in law yet, so let me have Tony." 

 "You can use the bedroom across the hall." 

 "Why? Looks like you have plenty of room on that bed. It will give me a chance to show Bobby what he has been missing all these years." 

 As she climbed on the bed said asked, "You eat pussy Tony?" 

 "Yes ma'am, I surely do." 

 "Then come on, let's get to it." 

 Tony hesitated and looked first at Bobby and then at Harvey and Harvey gave a little nod and Tony scrambled over to Pam and buried his face in her muff. In no time at all Pam was moaning as she shoved her pussy up at Tony's mouth. Harvey looked over at Tony and his about to be daughter in law and then he looked up at her and asked, "Why?" 

 "Tell you later. Right now you and Bobby need to get me off." 

 For the next six or eight minutes Harvey and Bobby worked to get her and themselves off, but their attention was on Pam and Tony. She heard Bobby mutter, "bitch" when Pam moved into a sixty-nine with the chauffer and just seconds later Bobby shot a load deep in her ass. He pulled out of her and went into the bathroom to wash his cock off and when he came back Pam was on her hands and knees and squealing as Tony fucked her from behind. Bobby watched for a minute and then he climbed on the bed and stuck his cock in front of Pam's face.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 07 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Go away" Pam grunted as Tony slammed into. "You've been pushing me away for years so you can just wait for tomorrow." 

 Bobby grabbed a handful of her hair and snarled "whore" as he pushed his cock against her lips and Pam opened her mouth. After that things got very active as the five of them switched partners back and forth. The high point of the night for her was watching father, son and chauffer three holing the bride to be. Pam was a cum covered mess and needed to take a shower but Bobby said no. 

 "You aren't done yet. There is still the limo ride back to the hotel." 

 "I have my car here." 

 "We will arrange to get it moved out to Steven's Lake." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She helped a very nervous Pam adjust her veil and then she parted the curtain and looked out at the assemblage. 

 "Is he there" Pam asked, afraid that after the previous night he would have run off. "Oh please Fran, tell me he's there." 

 She turned to Pam and smiled and then said, "He is not only there sweetie, but he looks very anxious; like he is afraid that you might not show up. I don't think you have to worry about him treating you like a sister anymore. You have an entirely new problem now." 

 "What?" 

 "You have to decide how to handle daddy in law and the chauffer from now on." 

 "Fuck them." 

 "What?" 

 "I'll fuck them. Bobby didn't seem to mind when daddy and Tony took turns on me on the back seat as Bobby drove the limo. Thank you Fran. Thank you for everything." 

 The music started playing and Pam got ready to walk down the aisle. Just before she walked out of the room to take her father's arm she said: 

 "And by the way, tell your friend that I will share as long as she doesn't try to steal him from me." 

 "My friend?" 

 "The one Bobby snuck off with before we went to your place. I saw how she looked at him and I will share because God knows that after last night Bobby knows that he is going to have to." 

 "Good luck" she said to Pam as Pam left the room, took her father's arm and headed for the next part of her life." 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 08 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "I suppose you are pleased with yourself" Harvey said to her as they left the wedding reception. It was the first time they had been alone since the doings at her house the night before. 

 "I guess I would have to say that I am." 

 "Why in the hell did you do it?" 

 She explained the talk she'd had with Pam in the lounge after the rehearsal dinner: 

 "That marriage would have been dead before the two of them finished speaking their vows if Bobby hadn't been shaken up. Maybe the way I did it was a little over the top, but I didn't have a whole lot of time to come up with an elaborate plan and one thing is for sure, he damned sure doesn't look at her like a sister any more." 

 "Maybe, but did you have to turn her into a slut to make it happen?" 

 "She already was a slut" and after making Harv promise not to tell Bobby she told him about the best man and the usher. "So we decided that letting Bobby know was the way to go." 

 "I can't believe he wasn't nailing her. I thought the two of them had been at it for years." 

 "The question now is did I cost myself a customer?" 

 "Why would you wonder about that?" 

 "You like married sluts and I saw how you were with Pam last night. Now you have one closer to home and she won't cost you a dime." 

 "She was a great fuck and I won't lie. She is a nice little fuck bunny and I will do her whenever I get the chance, but I don't think she has what I look for in my married sluts." 

 "And that would be?" 

 "A deliciously slutty mind. A mind like the one you showed me last night. A mind that could think of doing what you did is what will keep me coming back to you just to see what you might do next." 

 "Don't you be putting pressure on me to come up with stuff. Last night could very well be the only time I do something like that." 

 "Bullshit sweetie. You have already told me about your plan for sticking it to your husband, your goal of fucking someone in the wedding party of every wedding you work and your notebook full of check marks. Only a slutty mind could come up with stuff like that. But as to Pam; part of the fun of fucking married women is doing it behind their husband's back. In Pam's case Bobby would know and even though he was into last night it could gave been more because he was surprised and caught flat-footed by the situation and you and Pam didn't give him any choice or time to think about it. Before he had time to get a grip Pam was already working on Tony's dick. Shit!! 

 "What?" 

 "That brings up another potential problem. Tony has been with me a long time and he is a good and dependable employee. I'm going to have to watch how Bobby is around him from now on. I hope I don't have to let him go." 

 "Why would you have to let him go?" 

 "Bobby is family sweetie and you always side with family when there is trouble." 

 "Why would there be trouble?" 

 "If I'm already thinking about fucking Pam again, what do you think Tony is doing? And if he does try how will Bobby handle it? I can't blame Tony because Pam was the aggressor last night so who knows how he will behave around her. If Bobby gets bent out of shape over it Tony will have to go." 

 "That doesn't seem fair." 

 "It isn't, but no one was ever promised that life would be fair." 

 "What if Pam wants Tony's attentions?" 

 "Again sweetie, it depends on Bobby. If he is cool with it, there is no problem." 

 She sunk back in the leather seat and was quiet. Finally Harvey asked her what was wrong. 

 "I was trying to help, not screw things up for everyone. I like Tony and now it seems like I might have cost him his job." 

 "You didn't cost him his job sweetie. You may have cost him the job he has now, but I'm not asshole enough to put him out on the street over a piece of pussy. I'll find some other place in the company for him; some place where he and Bobby won't be in daily contact and where he won't have a lot of access to Pam. Does that make you feel better?" 

 "Some." 

 "Well how about this as a way to cheer you up. You like Tony so I'll ask him to join us tonight and I'll let you be the one who chooses what we do and who does what. That okay with you?" 

 "What ever I want to do?" 

 "You name it." 

 "I want to be fucked in every room of the house before you have to leave and go back to Los Angeles. I want you in the tool shed where Jake keeps the lawn tools and on his work bench in the basement and any other place that he spends time." 

 "There is that deliciously slutty mind at work again. You don't have to worry about being replaced sweetie; you are definitely a keeper." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She sucked Tony's cock as he sat on Jake's riding mower and Harvey fucked her from behind. She was fucked on Jake's work bench - her legs up on Tony's shoulders - while he fucked her hard and deep and she sucked Harvey's cock. They had her on the love seat in the family room. They fucked her on the kitchen table and the kitchen counter, the table and the top of the buffet in the dining room and on top of the washer and dryer in the laundry room. 

 Then things got a little kinky. 

 The two men were roughly the same size as Jake so they went through his closet and his dresser drawers and got out Jake's clothes which they wore while they fucked her in every piece of lingerie that Jake had bought her. When Monday morning rolled around there wasn't one room in the house that she had not been fucked in and not one piece of furniture that was big enough to hold her that she hadn't been taken on. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When Harvey dropped her at the hotel on Monday morning he handed her two large manila envelopes. 

 "The really thick one is a bonus for you. I've already told Dan to keep your schedule clear for the week after next. I'm only scheduled to be here for three days, but I'll want you on all three of them." 

 He leaned over and kissed her and then she was out of the limo and on her way to start her work week. 

 When she got to her office she closed and locked the door, sat down at her desk and opened the envelopes. The first one was full of one hundred dollar bills. She had spent five nights with Harvey and she expected that she would get two thousand a night with a little extra for the bachelor party. She was expecting to find between ten and twelve thousand dollars, but when she counted the money she was stunned! There was twenty thousand dollars in the envelope. 

 She picked up the second envelope and wondered what it could be. Harvey had said it was a bonus, but if it was money why wasn't it in the first envelope. She opened it and found a private detective's report detailing Jake's evening activities in Tampa. Wednesday and Thursday nights he spent the night with a Miss Sarah Gilman who he picked up in the hotel bar. Friday and Saturday were spent with a Mrs. Joan Feldman who he met on the beach outside his hotel. There was also a CD-ROM that had a note attached to it that said it contained images from mini-cams secreted in Jake's room while he was at work. She put it in her briefcase and would look at it when she got home and then put it and the cash in the safe deposit box with the hotel security tape and the other money she was earning as a party girl. 

 She picked up the phone, called Marci and asked Marci to meet her for coffee at ten and then she attacked the pile of paper on her desk. At ten she headed for the break room to take her coffee break with Marci. She had given some thought to what Pam had told her and to whether or not she should tell Marci. She decided not to. If Bobby called Marci fine, but no sense in getting Marci's hopes up. After Friday there was no telling what kind of talks went on between Bobby and Pam. It could very well turn out that the two of them would agree that the past was the past and that their wild oats had been sown and from then on they would be true to each other. Or not! It would be a case of just waiting to see. 

 Marci was already there when she got there. She sat down on the chair across from Marci and said: 

 "I noticed that you and Bobby disappeared about the same time on Friday. Just a coincidence?" 

 "Oh no, definitely not a coincidence. Thank you for letting me be your assistant so I'd have the chance." 

 "Get him out of your system?" 

 "It will be years, if ever, before that happens." 

 "What now?" 

 "I will try to talk Dan into using me more. Maybe if I stay busy I won't think about Bobby so much." 

 When she heard Marci say that she smiled to herself; that is what she had planned to do - ask Dan to keep Marci busy. 

 "What about you" Marci asked. "How goes your plan to stick it to Jake?" 

 "Good, or not, depending on how you look at it." 

 "That's a weird answer." 

 "Good because almost every night Jake has been gone I've had a cock in me. Bad because they have all been the same and I've not been able to put any new check marks in my notebook." 

 "The same ones every night?" 

 "Except for the bachelor party it has been Harv, Bobby and Tony the entire time Jake has been gone." 

 "I suppose it will be Harvey again tonight?" 

 "No. He was supposed to be here until tomorrow, but he got a call and he has to leave a day early." 

 "You open for an idea?" 

 "I don't know, what do you have in mind?" 

 "Jake won't be home until tomorrow evening right?" 

 "That's the way it is supposed to be but knowing Jake he might try and milk another day out of it. Why?" 

 "Where is it written that we can only play with whoever Dan sets us up with? Who says we can't find us a place tonight where there are a couple of available men and have us a girls night out? Who says we can only fuck for money?" 

 She sat there and thought about Marci's idea. After the last five days she had planned on resting with a quiet evening at home, but having a girls night out with Marci would give her a chance at another check mark for her notebook and she had promised herself that she would get laid every night Jake was out of town. Once Jake was home she would be limited to Dan and whatever afternoon dates he set her up with. What the hell; why not! 

 "Okay, count me in. Where do you want to go?" 

 "You choose. You have been at this longer than I have so you might have a better idea." 

 "I'll think on it and give you a call before quitting time." 

 When lunch time came she went to the bank where she had her safe deposit box and put away the private investigators report and the cash from Harvey and when she got back to work she found a note on her desk asking her to call Marci. 

 "Got your message, what's up?" 

 "I just wanted to check with you before I did something." 

 "Why?" 

 "I need to know if it is all right with you." 

 "If what is all right with me?" 

 "Dan has been after me to give him a taste. Would you mind?" 

 "Good Lord no. Why would I mind?" 

 "He did seem to be your private stock on afternoons." 

 "I have no attachment to Dan Marci; he is just a good fuck and I liked going home to Jake knowing that another man had fucked me only hours before I kissed Jake hello when I got home. But I thought you told me that you let Dan know you wouldn't do him because you didn't believe in work place affairs?" 

 "I've rethought that. Is it really an affair? It's more like taking care of your pimp if you know what I mean." 

 "Don't let him wear you out. Don't forget we have a girl's night out planned for after work." 

 "Honey, the girl I've become over the last week isn't about to let any one man wear me out. Eleven couldn't do it at the bachelor party - no way Dan can do it. Talk with you later." 

 "Oh my," she thought as she hung up the phone, "I think I've helped create a monster." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The two of them were sitting at a table just off the dance floor at the Landing Strip Lounge. They had just ordered their drinks and were looking around the place. 

 "See anyone you like" Marci asked. 

 "No, but it's early yet. The band won't set up for another half hour. Once they get going the place will fill up." 

 "What then?" 

 "We pick and choose and hopefully I'll be putting another check mark in my notebook." 

 "I'm thinking of doing that." 

 "What?" 

 "Starting to keep a record. Do you realize that in the last five days I've had sex with twelve different men and that isn't counting my husband? Twelve in just five days!" 

 "True, but pulling trains at bachelor parties isn't something that is going to happen all that often." 

 "Pity. I liked it. Hey! Why don't you find some way to make it part of the service when you plan and coordinate weddings. I can see it now; "Yes sir, in addition to the wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner we also provide a bachelor party. Would you like one woman or two?" 

 She laughed and then said, "It's a great idea, but it wouldn't work." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because it is usually the bride, the mother of the bride and sometimes the mother of the groom who work with me and I can just see myself offering them a bachelor party as part of the package. I rarely come in contact with the men until the wedding rehearsal." 

 "You're a smart girl; you will come up with a way." 

 She had to admit, she did like the idea, but she really didn't think it had a prayer of happening. 

 The band had been playing an hour and they had danced with three or four guys and had not had to pay for a drink, but so far none of the guys had made what could even remotely called a pass. She was debating on moving to another lounge when Marci said: 

 "Don't make it obvious, but check out what just walked in." 

 She glanced over at the door and saw two ruggedly handsome men standing there looking the place over. 

 "I'm running out of time here. I need to beat Frank home so I only have about two and half more hours. If something doesn't happen soon I'm the one who is going to make the pass and if those two aren't here to meet their wives or girl friends they are the ones I'm going to hit on." 

 "You are just awful. I can't believe you could be such a slut." 

 "Says the girl who was lying on the bed next to me last Friday with a dick in her mouth and another one in her pussy." 

 "At least I didn't go looking for it." 

 "Now you are rationalizing." 

 "Okay, okay, you win, I'm a slut. Now, how are we going to do this?" 

 "We wait until they sit down and then if they are alone we will attack." 

 "Attack?" 

 "Just follow my lead." 

 The two guys sat down and ordered drinks and then began looking around. One of them got up and asked a girl to dance and Marci said: 

 "That's it - that's the sign - they are alone. When he sits down we move." 

 "What if he brings her back to his table or joins her at hers?" 

 "Depends on her. If she hasn't let him know right up front she can be had she is history and just doesn't know it yet." 

 The music stopped and the guy walked the girl back to her table and then returned to his to join his buddy. "Come on Fran; time to get this show on the road." 

 She got up and followed Marci over to the table where the two guys were sitting and Marci said: 

 "Hi guys. I'm Marci and this is my friend Fran. We were wondering if you are here for the same reason we are." The two guys looked at each other, but before they could say anything Marci said, "Because if you are the question is why are we still here instead of some place where we could be getting it on?" 

 One guy said, "Are you for real?" 

 "You will never find out sitting there." 

 The other guy chuckled and said, "I've been know to be silly, but I try real hard not to be stupid and I think I would be stupid to pass up on this." He stood up and said, "My name is Roy and the slow on the up take guy there is Steve." 

 "Slow on the up take my ass!" the other guy said as he stood up. "Our place, your place or a motel?" 

 "My husband doesn't have a sense of humor and since he could show up in the middle my place is out." She turned to Fran, "Your husband is out of town until tomorrow isn't he?" 

 "Yes and he won't be back until late tomorrow night." 

 "Can we use your place?" 

 She thought about her resolve never to do it in her own home, but Harvey had shot that all to hell so she said: 

 "Sure, why not?" 

 "No offense ladies," Steve said, "But I'm not big on being surprised by husbands coming home earlier than expected so why don't we use my place." 

 "Let's go" Marci said, "We will follow you so we don't have to come back for our cars." 

 "We don't mind bringing you back" Steve said. 

 "That's nice" Marci said, "But I'm tight for time. I only have a couple of hours before I have to be home and I don't want to waste the time it would take to come back." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As soon as they were inside Steve's apartment Steve said, "Who is with who?" 

 "It is your apartment," Marci said "So you choose." 

 "I kind of like women who take charge so I choose you." 

 He turned to Fran and said, "The couch is a fold-out and Roy knows how to open it" and then he took Marci's hand and led her off to the bedroom. Roy opened the sofa bed and started undressing. As he dropped his trousers he asked: 

 "What's your pleasure?" 

 "Straight up fucking" she said as she dropped her bra on the floor. "I like doggie or on my back with my legs up on your shoulders so you can go deep." 

 "Most girls want a little pussy licking to start." 

 "I would like it too, but I've been hot and wet for hours and I'm ready." 

 He took her with her legs up on his shoulders the first time and after she had sucked him hard again he took her doggie. She was begging him to do her harder and deeper when Marci walked up to the fold-out and stood there watching. Marci waited until Roy pushed his load out and then Marci said: 

 "Can we switch?" 

 Roy looked from Marci to her and then asked, "Would you mind?" 

 "I don't know. I know I can get you up again, but I don't know about Steve's stamina. Can he get it up again now that my slut girlfriend is done with him?" 

 "I got him back up before I came out here. He is lying on his back with his pole pointing up at the ceiling. All he needs is your slutty cunt sliding down on it." 

 She looked at Roy and then shrugged. "Well, if you don't mind I sure don't" and she got off the sofa bed and headed for the bedroom. She wasn't eight steps away when she heard, "That's it baby, suck it" and she turned and saw that Marci already had a mouthful. 

 Steve was lying on the bed and as Marci had indeed left him ready to go. She climbed on the bed, moved over him and as he lifted his hips her pussy swallowed the engorged pole. She leaned forward, putting the pressure on her clit and then she moved up and down on Steve as he played with her tits. Sliding up and down and rocking back and forth soon brought her to the edge of an orgasm and she moaned: 

 "I'm close, I'm close, ohhh yessssss, I'm gonna cum." 

 Steve flipped her over onto her back and gave it to her hard and fast and she cried out as the orgasm grabbed her. Steve kept driving hard into her until he too had his climax and then he fell to the bed beside her. She was lying there catching her breath and fondling Steve's limp cock when Marci came into the room. 

 "Got to run" she said as she started gathering up her clothes. "See you at work tomorrow" and she headed for the bathroom to get dressed. 

 Roy walked into the room, sat down on the edge of the bed and asked as he reached out and began to roll her left nipple between his fingers: 

 "Do you have to leave also?" 

 She looked into his eyes and said, "As long as there are hard cocks to play with I'll stay and play." 

 "Help me then" and he moved up on the bed and positioned himself so his cock was an inch from her mouth. She smiled and then her lips wrapped around him and she went to work. Roy started moving slowly back and forth pumping his semi- soft cock into her mouth. She took her mouth off his cock and then licked and sucked on his balls before taking his cock back into her mouth.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 08 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Meanwhile her hand had been working on Steve's cock and it too began to stiffen. Steve pushed her hand away and then he moved between her legs. She automatically spread them and waited for his cock to enter her, but instead she felt his hot breath on her pussy. His hands went under her ass and he pulled her pussy to his mouth and treated it to a sensuous kiss. She was stunned! She had two loads of Roy's cum in her and the load that he had just given her and he was eating her pussy! The juices were flowing out of her as he licked and kissed her slit. His lips captured her clit and went to work on it and she screamed in delight as her body shook with an orgasm. 

 At that point Steve rolled her over and as her body still trembled from the force of her climax he pulled her up to her knees and as Roy positioned himself so her head was over his cock Steve pushed into her from behind. She was pushing her ass back at Steve and her head was bobbing up and down on Roy and he body was shaking with orgasms. 

 After several minutes Roy moaned that he was going to shoot and she clamped her lips tight around him and Roy sent a flood of hot cum into her mouth. She gulped and swallowed and kept on sucking until he went limp and fell out of her mouth. Steve was pounding hard into her and she was slamming her ass back at him when he too sent his load into her and triggered yet another climax. 

 As she lay between the two men relaxing and enjoying the feeling of sexual satisfaction Roy asked her if she could spend the night. She thought about it for a moment before saying no, that she needed to go home and get a little rest before she had to go to work in the morning. 

 "But I do have time for one more before I have to go." 

 "Dibs on pussy this time" Roy said and she laughed. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As she drove home she thought back to when Steve had eaten her cum filled pussy and how intense her pleasure had been when he did it. She wanted to feel it again, only she wanted to feel it as she fed some other man's sperm to Jake. Would she ever be able to do that? 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 09 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She managed to get four hours sleep before the clock went off. As she showered she ran through a mental checklist. She had cleaned the house thoroughly so that there would be no sign that she had "entertained" while Jake was gone. She had washed and put away the clothes of Jake's that Harv and Tony had worn while they had fucked her. She had even remembered to clean the cum stains off the seat of the riding lawn mower. The place would be ready for Jake when he got home. 

 Jake was sure to want to make love when he got home so she would have to make sure that Dan fucked her if he couldn't set her up with someone. She could not - just could not - give Jake pussy unless it had been freshly used by someone else. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She had just sat down at her desk when the phone rang. It was Marci telling her that Dan wanted to see her in his office. 

 "You don't look any the worse for wear this morning" Marci said when she walked into Dan's outer office. 

 "No thanks to you. I can't believe that you bailed out on me and left me with two sex starved young kids." 

 "Hey, you knew going in that I would have to leave to beat the asshole home. Besides, I was more worried about them. You forget dearie, I've seen you in action. Go right in; he's waiting for you." 

 Dan looked up and smiled when she walked into his office. He pointed at the chair opposite the desk as he said: 

 "Good morning sweetie. What do you have on your schedule today?" 

 "Not much. No weddings this weekend for a change. I do have the Advertising Council conference tomorrow, but it has been covered. Should have nothing to do on it unless there is a last minute problem. Day after tomorrow is the seminar put on by that guy who is trying to sell his system for playing the stock market and that one is a piece of cake. Coffee and donuts at ten and he will be out of there by noon." 

 "So you will be free for lunch today?" 

 "I suppose." 

 "Good. You and I are going to have lunch with a friend of mine and after that I believe that he will keep you busy most of the afternoon. Harvey tells me that you pull a pretty good train. Is that right?" 

 "Let us just say that I know how to party with a group." 

 "How would you feel about acting as a hostess at a poker party?" 

 "Describe hostess?" 

 "Serve beer and snacks and satisfy sexual urges." 

 "For how many?" 

 "Six, counting myself." 

 "I could probably do it, but the question is when? Jake is due back today so evenings are out until he leaves on another trip." 

 "According to Harvey that will be the week after next. But back to the poker game. It will be tomorrow from one until six. If you can't or don't want to do it I can probably get Marci to do it." 

 "Oh I'll do it all right. No way will I pass up a chance to give Jake a pussy that well used." 

 "I'll swing by your office around eleven to pick you up for lunch." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Lunch with Dan and his friend Al was pleasant. The afternoon with Al was enjoyable and she had another envelope to add to her safe deposit box. She was showered and well douched when she got home. Jake was already there and unpacking his bags when she walked into the house and the first thing he said was: 

 "What's for dinner?" 

 She lifted her skirt and pointed to her pussy and said: "This! And if you do a good enough job on it I might even see my way clear to cooking you a steak." 

 As Jake lapped at her pussy she remembered Al sliding his cock in it only an hour earlier and the thought triggered an orgasm. Jake took his mouth off of her and asked: 

 "What is going on with you? I never used to be able to get you off just by eating your beaver." 

 "You never used to be gone for a week at a time before either. I get super horny when I'm doing without and so I'm much more responsive when you do get home and take care of me." 

 Jake went back to sucking and licking her well used pussy and she wished again that she could be brave enough to leave at least just a taste of someone else's cum in her pussy for Jake to lap up. Oh well, maybe some day. After several minutes Jake moved as if he were going to get in a position for a sixty-nine and she said: 

 "No Jake, I need it in my pussy now. I'm ready for it baby, let me have it now." 

 Since finding out about what Jake was doing she made it policy not to suck Jake's cock until he had been in her pussy. While she wanted Jake to taste whatever flavor her lovers might have left behind and that she couldn't wash off, she had no intension of tasting who he had last been with. She would at least dilute it with her juices. 

 She parted her legs and Jake moved between them and as he pushed his cock into her she was thinking about the poker party the next day. Depending on how many times the six men took her she might have to plead "headache" for a couple of days to keep Jake from feeling the 'looseness.' Then she suddenly remembered that whole purpose behind what she was doing was to give Jake recently used pussy. She would just have to fuck his eyes out that night and again in the morning. If he commented on the looseness she would say it was because of how many times he had done her. 

 She did Jake four times that night and twice the next morning and then jokingly said: 

 "I may have to stay home from work today lover. I don't know if I will even be able to walk after the workout you have given me." 

 "Make it through the day baby and tonight I'll kiss it and make it better." 

 She smiled and said, "I will hold you to that lover; I will most definitely hold you to that." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She spent the morning doing paperwork and clearing out her "in" basket. At ten to twelve Dan called her and asked if she was ready to go and she said yes. He told her to meet him in the parking garage and then he drove her to his condo. When they walked in the door she saw the appreciation on the faces of the five players (Dan being the sixth) and that made her feel good. 

 It was pretty much the same as they card game part of Bobby's bachelor party. It started with her keeping the chip and dip bowls full and fetching beers for the players. A trip to the table to deliver a beer or fill a bowl always got her a hand on a breast, a hand up under her skirt or a hand rubbing her ass. 

 An hour into the game one of the guys threw in his hand and said: 

 "That's it for me. My luck at this table sucks so I'm going to see if I can do better in the bedroom." He looked at her and said, "How about it sweetie? Think these guys can get their own beers for a while?" 

 She smiled at him and said, "I guess they will just have to, won't they?" She reached out and took his hand. "Come on lover, the bedroom is this way" and she led him from the room. 

 He was pounding her hard and she was right on the edge of an orgasm when the next man came into the room and started undressing. Then the card game ended as everyone got up to see what was going on in the bedroom. Everyone but Dan did her twice. Dan did her three times; the last as they showered together after the others had left. Then Dan had driven her back to the hotel so she could pick up her car. As she started to get out of his car he handed her an envelope. 

 "The guys told me to tell you that you were worth every penny. Pete wants to marry you and Benny asked me to ask you if he could see you again. I think he would like to make a steady arrangement with you. All in all you were a big hit." He looked at her quietly for a moment and then said, "I'm going to miss you." 

 "Miss me? Why? Are you going to fire me?" 

 "No sweetie, but I'm betting that it won't be too much longer before Harvey makes you an offer that you can't refuse." 

 "I don't think he can do that. I'm committed to fucking over Jake for a long as I can and going with Harvey would put an end to that." 

 "I hope you mean it sweetie because I am in no hurry to lose you." 

 "Not to worry Dan; I'm meeting way too many interesting people through you." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Jake was already home when she got there and he had already started fixing dinner. He must have been feeling guilty about something because him doing anything inn the kitchen was something that rarely happened. 

 "What's the occasion?" 

 "I'm sorry honey. I know I've only been home two days, but I have to fly to Houston in the morning and I won't be back until some time Saturday." 

 Inside she was smiling - a chance to get more check marks - but outside she decided that it was time for some payback. 

 "You know Jake, for over a year now I've listened to you harp on how my job always seems to get in the way, but what about your job? When are you home any more? It is getting so that you rush in the door, make love to me a couple of times and then say, "Se you babe" and rush right back out the door. Your job is playing hell with my sex life Jake and I'm not the least bit happy about it. All the things that you used to bitch at me about are what you are doing now." 

 It was all she could do to keep from spitting in his face when he said, "I'm hurting too baby." She thought of the private investigators report sitting in her safe deposit box and seethed although she hid it well. 

 "I'm on the edge here honey. I've got their interest and I can smell the promotion. Once I get it I won't have to do these road trips and things will get back to normal. Please baby; just bear with me. I promise you things will get better." 

 She walked over to the stove and turned the burners off. "We don't have time for dinner. If you are leaving tomorrow and won't be back until Saturday you have your work cut out for you. But first you have a promise to keep. You have to kiss it and make it better and then you will have to use it a weeks worth." 

 "Oh I'll kiss it and make it better all right, but I don't know about the weeks worth part. No way am I going to be able to get it up a dozen times, but I will do my best." 

 She spread her legs wide and waited with a smile on her face as his mouth moved toward her pussy. She let out a sigh as Jake's tongue slipped between the folds of her pussy and started working on her clit. She felt incredibly hot knowing that he was feasting on her after all those other cocks had been there. Jake hungrily ate her pussy, probing deep with his tongue. She could feel her juices starting to run as an orgasm took hold of her and she hoped that there might be a trace of cum mixed in with her juices as Jake lapped them up. 

 After that it was straight sucking and fucking until Jake couldn't get it up any more. She fell asleep content knowing that she had fucked over her husband one more time. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The first thing she did when she got to work the next day was stop by Marci's desk and ask her if she wanted to play a little after work. She told Marci about Jake's sudden road trip and how she would be free in the evenings for the rest of the week. 

 "I can't tonight Fran. I told asshole I'd go with him to a cocktail party that his boss is having, but I don't have anything planned for tomorrow." 

 "Then I guess I'll let Dan know I'm available for the evening. Maybe he will have something for me to do. Have him call me when he gets in." 

 Dan called her at nine and she filled him in and told him she was free for the next two evenings if he needed her to take care of someone. 

 "How free Fran?" 

 "I've got until Jake gets back from his trip on Saturday." 

 "Up to taking a road trip of your own?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Remember Jared?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She woke up first and glanced over at the bedside clock and smiled. She had time before needing to leave for the airport so she pulled the sheet back to expose his naked body and then she slid down and took his cock in her mouth. She gave Jared a leisurely blow job until he was fully awake and then she rolled over on her back. Jared ran his fingers along her pussy and ass and she was more than ready for him to make love to her. Jared moved over her and as his cock pushed in to her she pushed her hips up to meet his thrusts. She could feel his cock swell, getting harder as it pushed deeper into her. 

 "You like that?" she heard him say. 

 "Oh yes lover; oh yes I do." 

 She gasped as he started fucking her harder and faster. "Yes" she moaned, "Like that; hard and fast like that. Fuck me, make me cum." 

 Jared was ramming her hard and she was crying out, "Yes, yes, yes" as her ass was bouncing off the mattress and her nails were dug into his ass trying to pull him in deeper. She screamed as she came and seconds later Jared spilled into her. 

 She lay there basking in that warm "just fucked" mood and was wishing that she didn't have to get up, shower and get ready to leave. Her cell phone chirped and she was reaching for it when Jared's hand caught her arm. 

 "Don't answer it. If you don't get involved in a phone call that might drag on we may just have time for one more." 

 "I have to answer it. The only person it could be is my husband and if he can't reach me he might start having thoughts that I don't want him to have." 

 The phone stopped chirping as she picked it up and she hit the buttons to pull up "missed calls." It had been Jake. She hit the 'pre-set' for his cell and when he answered she said: 

 "I was on the pot sweetie and couldn't get to the phone quick enough. What's up?" 

 "Bad news honey. I'm stuck here another day. I can't get out of here until tomorrow afternoon. That should get me home by nine." 

 "You know Jake, I could really learn to hate that that fucking job of yours" and she disconnected. She put the phone back on the bedside table and it started chirping almost immediately as Jake tried to get back to her. She smiled at Jared. 

 "You wanted one more? If you can change my flight to tomorrow you can have several more." 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 10 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She was all set to play the role of pissed off wife when Jake got home. On her flight home from Chicago she had given some thought as to how someone who really loved her husband would take what was going on as far as Jake's job was concerned. She figured that a loving wife would be more and more upset as things went on and then she would finally get pissed. So, although she was tickled to death to have him gone she needed to appear to be pissed at him for all of his absences. 

 "Honey, I'm home" he called out as he came in the front door and dropped his suitcase on the floor. She glanced at her watch and saw that it was twenty after nine. She was in the family room reading (on the same couch where Harvey and Tony had double-teamed her) and she didn't answer. She had a fine line that she had to walk. She had to play the upset and extremely pissed off wife while at the same time not letting things get so out of hand that there would be no fucking that night. She had fucked Jared three times between the time she got up and left his place to catch her flight and, as always, it was important to her that she give Jake pussy that someone else had recently used. Jake came into the room and said: 

 "There you are. Don't I get a hug and a kiss?" 

 She ignored him and kept on reading her book. He stood there looking at her, apparently unsure of what was going on. 

 "What's the matter Fran?" 

 "You know damned well what's the matter." 

 "Oh, that again." 

 "Yes Jake, that again." 

 "It is my job Fran. It is what I do for a living. It is what pays the bills." 

 "That may be Jake, but it is not what I signed on for. I signed up for a life with my husband Jake and not a life where my front door is a revolving door for my husband. You worked your job all these years and maybe made a trip twice a year and now it is every god damned week. And that isn't even the worst of it. Do you realize that on your last five trips you have told me when you would be back only to call me the day before I expected you home to tell me that you had to stay longer? Right now I am thanking God that I never let you talk me into quitting my job. At least it gives me something to do with my time. It keeps me from having to sit here in this house all alone all the time." 

 "I keep telling you it is going to get better honey. It won't be much longer." 

 "Well I've got a news flash for you Jake. It had better not be much longer because I've been offered a promotion. I've turned it down twice because it means that I would have to travel and I didn't want that, but if you are never going to be here anyway I might just change my mind." 

 She got off the couch and headed for the stairs. 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "To bed!" she snarled at him as she headed toward the bedroom. 

 She knew Jake and she knew what he would do to try to smooth things over. It was about fifteen minutes before he came into the room and got in bed with her and in less than fifteen seconds she felt his hand on her right breast. She ignored him and his hand slid down and he began rubbing her pussy. She stayed still and kept quiet for maybe a minute and then she moaned, muttered "damn you Jake" and opened her legs. He moved down and she felt his tongue slide across her pussy lips and then enter her and she smiled as Jake licked the pussy that Jared had used three times that day. Three times that day and twenty-six other times from the time she got off of the flight to Chicago. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was looking at a busy week when she went back to work on Monday. She had an event every day that week and a wedding on Saturday. She spent the day contacting suppliers and arranging for services and she didn't even have time to break loose for a quickie with Dan. She did stop for a drink after work with Marci and Marci told her about the two "dates" that Dan had arranged for her the previous week while Fran had been in Chicago. She almost asked Marci if they were helping her get past Bobby, but decided that bringing up Bobby would only upset Marci. 

 She told Marci about Chicago and then Marci asked if there was a possibility that they might be able to go out some night that week. 

 "I don't see how since Jake will be home all week. But he will be gone next week. Harvey will be in town, but I don't know what he has planned for me so I may have one or two nights that we could go out and play." 

 She knew as soon as she mentioned Harvey that she should not have. Mentioning Harv triggered memories of Bobby and she saw the change come over Marci's face. Marci looked at her watch and said she needed to be going so they finished their drinks and got up and left. Since she couldn't give Jake used pussy that night she pleaded a headache and went to bed early. 

 Tuesday she was able to squeeze in an hour with Dan in room 601 and he got two hours from her in 321 on Wednesday, but Thursday she was snowed under with work. Thursday night was the rehearsal dinner for Saturday's wedding and as she checked out the men who were there she saw that unless she was willing to settle for fat, balding and ugly the pickings were slim. The groom, the best man and one of the ushers were the only ones with any appeal, but the best man was out because he had a girlfriend and she was hanging all over him. She was contemplating a move on the usher when another guy came into the room and went up to the usher and from the way they behaved toward each other it was obvious that the usher was gay. That left the bridegroom but she couldn't see any way to get to him. It looked like that wedding was going to give her her first failure. 

 She handed out the complimentary drink coupons and then went to her office to sign off on the voucher request for the comp tickets. That done she headed for the bar to have one drink before going home. She saw the bridegroom sitting at the end of the bar staring down into a beer and on a whim she sat down next to him and said: 

 "Having second thoughts?" 

 He looked at her and said, "And thirds and fourths and fifths." 

 "She looked like a nice enough girl." 

 "Oh she is that all right." 

 "Then what seems to be the problem?" 

 Without looking at her he said, "You, for one thing." 

 "Me? How did I get into this?" 

 "What I mean is that you are emblematic of what is wrong." 

 "Explain please." 

 "How can I get married when I want to make a pass at damned near every woman I see? This afternoon I got a haircut and the girl that cut my hair turned me on and I made a pass at her. She said her boyfriend wouldn't like it if she went out with me, but the fact is that even though I am getting married in two days I still took a shot at her. You walked into the rehearsal dinner tonight and all I could think of was ditching Shelly in a hurry so I could take a shot at you. And I would have too if I hadn't noticed your rings. So how can I get married with an attitude like that?" 

 "If that is how it is why have you let it get this far? Why didn't you cancel or at least postpone the wedding?" 

 "Because Shelly is the perfect fit for me. She is everything that I ever wanted wrapped up in a beautiful package. If I were to let her get away I know that I would never find another one like her." 

 "But with your attitude you will probably end up running around on her and if or when she finds out what then? The way it looks to me you have some options, but the problem is that none of them are good." 

 "Options? I don't see any." 

 "You could tell her how you feel and ask her to postpone things until you get it out of your system. She might surprise you and say that she feels the same way; she might be understanding and tell you she will wait or she may tell you to fuck off and die. 

 "You could get married and hope that you don't get caught, but the odds are that you will. When it happens she might leave you or she just might just say. "Okay, you want to cheat so I will too" and I don't know how you would feel about that. Maybe you could agree to have an "open" marriage. Or you could just walk away and leave her standing at the alter. She would be hurt and would probably never forgive you, but the odds are that the first two options would also hurt her. Anyway, it gives you something to think about between now and Saturday. And there is something else you need to think about." 

 "What?" 

 "This" she said as she took off her rings and dropped them in her purse. You said something about taking a shot at me, but the rings scared you off." She held up her hand in front of his face and asked, "What rings?" 

 He looked at her blankly for a second or so and then he broke into a smile and said, "Wait here while I go get us a room." 

 "Never mind about that" she said as she took her master key card out of her purse. "I'll take care of the room. 

 Once in the room she quickly stripped off her clothes, got on the bed and waited for him to get undressed. When his cock sprang free from its confinement she couldn't believe the size of it. It was by far the biggest she had ever run across. She marveled at its size and her pussy started tingling at the thought of taking it in. 

 He moved to the bed and she moved her head to take his cock in her mouth. She kissed the head of it and licked it with her tongue while she wrapped her hand around it. It throbbed with an urgency to get into her and he moaned as her mouth closed around the cock head. She didn't spend as much time as he would have liked sucking on him because she wanted his cock in her. She just had to know how something that big would feel in her. He worked into her slowly, giving her time to get used to his size, and then he slowly started fucking her. She felt stuffed. That was the only way she could describe it - stuffed! But other than a full feeling it didn't feel that much different from any of the other cocks she had taken since she started getting back at Jake. She enjoyed the fucking, but somehow because of his size she expected more. When he came it didn't feel any different from any of the others. Oh well, her string was unbroken, she had another check mark for her book and she did get one nice orgasm out of it so what more could a girl ask for? 

 She watched him dress and as he headed for the door she said, "Good luck lover. I hope that whatever you decide works out for you." 

 She showered and douched and then hurried home to get her used pussy to Jake while it was still warm from her romp with the bridegroom. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Jake was watching television when she got home and even though she wanted to feed him her used pussy she wanted him to have to ask for it. It made it all the more sweeter when he asked. She walked into the living room and told Jake she was beat and that she was going right to bed. 

 She was lying there pretending to be asleep when Jake got into bed. She knew that he was going to want to make love and she knew how he would try to get her to do it. When she felt his hand on her breast she said: 

 "No Jake, not tonight; I'm just too tired." 

 He pulled her over onto her back and kissed her stomach and then moved his mouth down her body to her pussy. In the darkness he couldn't see her smile as she opened her legs to let him get at what she wanted him to have. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Friday at two-ten as Dan was sliding his cock into her he said, "Don't forget to keep next week clear. Harvey will be back in town sometime Monday afternoon." 

 That of course meant that when she got home Jake would be telling her that he had to go out of town again. Should she pretend to get pissed over it? Well, maybe just a little, but not enough to keep him from lapping her pussy while it was still fresh from clasping Dan's cock. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 11 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She was having lunch with Marci on Monday and they were talking shop when Marci asked: 

 "Isn't your boy supposed to be here today?" 

 "My boy?" 

 "You know what I mean. Isn't Harvey supposed to be here?" 

 "Some time this afternoon is what I was told." 

 "So it is doubtful that we will be able to have a girl's night out?" 

 "I don't know. I don't have any idea what his schedule is until he gets here and we have a chance to talk. But you will get to play. Dan doesn't like to send used goods to one of his friends so that means you get to take care of him as long as Harvey is here." 

 "But doing Dan doesn't get me any check marks in my book. That's how you do it right? He only gets a mark in the book the first time?" 

 "It is your book so you get to do it anyway that you want. I do it the way I do it because when I finally show it to Jake I want him to see how many it was and not how many times they did it." 

 "I guess that makes sense. I guess if I marked down each time I'd go through the book in a hurry." 

 She was about to tell Marci to buy more books when her cell phone went off and she got it out of her purse. It was Dan telling her that Harvey was out front waiting for her in his limo. She put her phone away. 

 "That was Dan. Harvey is here. I've got to go. Talk with you later." 

 The limo was parked at the curb and when Tony saw her coming he got out and opened the door for her. She kissed him on the cheek, said "Thank you" and then slid onto the back seat next to Harvey. 

 "Miss me?" she asked as the door closed behind her. 

 "My driver gets a kiss and I get conversation?" 

 She reached over and put a hand on his leg. "And just where would you like your kiss?" 

 "Why don't you start at the top and work your way down?" he said as he leaned over and put his mouth to hers. He broke the kiss and asked: 

 "The condo or your house?" 

 "My place. I want you on my husband's bed." 

 Her head was bobbing up and down on Harvey's cock when Tony pulled up in front of her house. 

 "You want to finish here sweetie or go into the house?" 

 She took her mouth off his cock long enough to say, "The windows are tinted and the neighbors can't see" and she went back to sucking his cock. She had him close to cumming before they turned into the drive so it only took her another minute or so to get him to cum. She swallowed all he put out and then licked his cock clean before saying: 

 "Better tuck it away. I'm not sure that the neighbors would understand my taking a man into my house who had his cock hanging out for all to see." 

 "Will we be needing Tony?" 

 "You know the answer to that lover. I'm on your time so we do whatever you want to do." 

 "How about it Tony? You want to stay?" 

 "If it is all right with you Mr. McMartin." 

 "That's settled then. Let's get into the house." 

 They went straight to the bedroom and as she took off her clothes she watched the two men strip as they watched her. She could see the anticipation in their eyes and she wondered what they saw in hers. She moved to Harvey and took his hard cock in her hand. She bent down and kissed the head of his cock and then she ran her tongue along the top and then down the underside. Her mouth went over the head and as she closed her lips around him she heard him moan. 

 Meanwhile, Tony was turning her body and maneuvering her into a kneeling position with her knees wide apart and the he slid a finger into her pussy. She started to move her hips as his fingers worked into her as she continued to suck on Harvey. She gasped as Tony slid his cock up into her and then she just gave herself over to the two men to do with whatever they pleased. 

 Hours later she was lying on the bed between the two men when Harvey asked her if she had thought of any other place that needed to be "christened." She thought on it and then said: 

 "No, not here, but I have been thinking that there is one other place I'd like to do it." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 An hour later they were crossing the lobby and the security guard said, "Good evening Mr. McMartin." 

 "Good evening Ralph. How's Mary doing?" 

 "She's fine sir." 

 "Tell her I said hi." 

 They got in the elevator and Harvey pushed the button for the fifth floor. When the elevator stopped Harvey led her and Tony to a small office on the west side of the building and opened the door. She stepped inside the office and looked around. A desk, two chairs and two file cabinets. She turned to Harvey and Tony and said: 

 "No way are we going to be able to do it on top of the file cabinets so here is what we will do." 

 She wished someone could be filming it as a naked Harvey and a naked Tony sat on top of the file cabinets and as she (also naked) moved back and forth between them and sucked their cocks. Tony came first and she swallowed his juices and then told him to stay where he was while she concentrated on getting Harvey off. It took another three minutes before Harvey gave her her reward and then she went back and forth again until both men were erect. 

 She had them get down from the file cabinets and sit down on the two chairs and then she played her version of musical chairs moving back and forth between the laps of the two men until she got both of them off. She sucked them hard again and moved to the desk. She laid down on her back and then both men took turns fucking her. Harvey pounded into her as she sucked Tony's cock and then the two men switched places again and again and again. She lost track of how many orgasms they gave her before they were both spent. 

 As a final act she used her panties to wipe her pussy going so far as to work them up inside her to get them good and soaked with her lover's juices and then she tossed them into Jake's center desk drawer. They were generic cotton and with nothing on them to identify them as hers. Jake would find them and then go crazy wondering whose they were and how they came to be in his desk. 

 As they left the building Harvey asked, "Now what?" 

 "Want to wake up with me in the morning on Jake's bed?" 

 When Harvey dropped her off at work the next morning he said, "How about a somewhat more traditional evening tonight? Dinner, dancing and then some serious necking that might lead to...who knows?" 

 "Deal - as long as we wake up on Jake's bed in the morning." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Her day was an active one as she stayed busy stomping out little fires that kept cropping up. A union problem in the setting up of Ballroom B for a jewelry show; the wrong flowers delivered for the motivational seminar in the Aspen Room and a call from the wife of the minister who was supposed to officiate at the French wedding on Saturday saying that he was in the hospital because of a stroke and wouldn't be able to attend. It took almost an hour to find a replacement for him. And there were a good half dozen other smaller, but still important things to take care of. She was glad when the day was finally over and was looking forward to the drinks she would have with dinner. 

 Dinner was over and she and Harvey were sipping Baileys Irish Cream when Harvey asked: 

 "Do you have a plan for what you are going to do with your husband?" 

 "A plan? No, not really. Just get as many check marks in the book as I can before letting him know." 

 "But when are you going to let him know? What is going to be the trigger?" 

 "I don't know. I've never really given it much thought. It has always been one of those "I'll know it when I see it" kind of things. Why?" 

 "I just wondered how far you have looked ahead." 

 "At what?" 

 "At the outcomes. There are only two outcomes that I can see. The first is that you say "You did this and I did that and now we are even. Do you want to try and save the marriage now and make it work?" The second of course is divorce." 

 "No way will I be going with the first. It has always been going to be a divorce." 

 "Then why drag it on? You already have enough to rub his face in. End it and get on with your life." 

 "I told you my plan Harv. It is to let him support me in the style to which I have become accustomed while I stick it to him. If I end it I end up a single woman in an apartment somewhere. I do not want to give up what I have and that means Jake's paycheck has to keep coming in." 

 "It doesn't need to be that way." 

 "It does unless I hit the lottery." 

 "Well then, here I am." 

 "Here you are?" 

 "The lottery sweetie. I want you to come to work for me as my personal assistant. The pay is probably ten percent higher than what you and Jake combined are taking home now and one of the fringe benefits is a two bedroom condo. And, you get to furnish the place to your liking and send the bill to me." 

 "Have you talked with Dan about this?" 

 "No. Why?" 

 "Just the other day he asked me how much longer I was going to work for him and when I asked him why he asked that he told me that he thought that you would be making me an offer." 

 "I haven't mentioned it to him, but he does know how highly I think of you. So what do you think?" 

 "I'm flattered Harvey; I really am, but I have to say no." 

 "Can you tell me why?" 

 "Because you would not be getting what you would be paying for." 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "What I mean Harv is that you want a slut; a slut with - how did you put it? - a slut with a deliciously slutty mind? That isn't what you would get Harv. I only became the slut that I am to get back at Jake. Everything I've done has been with one goal in mind and that was to be as bad as I could be and then throw every last little bit of it in Jake's face. Once Jake and I are through the slut goes away. I'll probably try and find a nice guy and give marriage another try. That's the real me Harvey; a loving wife and homemaker. It is what I was before I found out about Jake and it is what I want to go back to being." 

 "Sweetie, believe me when I say that you are enjoying being a slut and you won't be able to go back to the loving wife and homemaker mode." 

 "I hope that you are wrong." 

 "Either way you need to start looking ahead and making plans. We will be offering your husband the promotion he has been looking for, but the job is in Atlanta so if he takes it you will be moving." 

 "How did we get on this depressing subject? I thought we were going to have a nice dinner and then go to my place and play." 

 "We did have a nice dinner and I'm certainly up for the play part if you are." 

 "Then let's go do it." 

 As Tony drove them to her house she rolled over in her mind what Harvey had just told her. It looked as if her confrontation with Jake was fast approaching. She was not going to move to Atlanta. That information changed things in a big way. She had expected to have several years before she ended things with Jake. Harvey was right; she did need to start looking ahead. Harvey interrupted her thoughts. 

 "I think I would like to have you to myself tonight. Is that okay with you?" 

 "Of course it is lover." 

 When they got to her place Harvey told Tony to pick them up at seven in the morning and she and Harvey went into the house. Harvey made slow leisurely love to her and they fell asleep in each other's arms. 

 On the ride into to work the next morning she asked Harvey for a favor. 

 "What would you like sweetie? 

 "Let me know a day ahead of time when you get ready to offer Jake his promotion." 

 "Why?" 

 "I'll hit him with the divorce papers when he comes home all smiles and bubbling over. It will be my answer to him when he asks me how I feel about moving to Atlanta." 

 "I take it that you have made up your mind." 

 "I'm not moving to Atlanta so it is time to end it with Jake. It would be nice if you gave him a big raise with the promotion. It would help me in how much alimony I can get out of him." 

 "Are you sure about this?" 

 "Positive." 

 "I'll give you a call later today with the number of the attorney you should use. Marty is an absolute shark. Your husband will be lucky to get out of the marriage with the clothes on his back." 

 "Good! That's just what I'm after." 

 "Then what will you do?" 

 "I don't know yet." 

 "Keep my offer in mind. What time do you want me to pick you up tonight?" 

 "I'm usually done by five on Wednesday." 

 "I'll be here at five then." 

 She got out of the limo and when she reached the door of the building she turned and watched it drive away. She thought about how fast things could change and then she went inside. 

 At ten Marci called her. "You know what your schedule is yet?" 

 "He flies back to San Francisco tomorrow at two." 

 "You have any plans for tomorrow night?" 

 "No." 

 "Want to go out and play?" 

 "Well I did promise myself that I would get laid every night that Jake is away so I guess we could go out looking together." 

 "Good. I hate going out there by myself. I tried it alone Monday and I spent the whole night sitting there and being nervous." 

 "Didn't hook up?" 

 "Oh yeah, I found a guy, but while I enjoyed the hell out of what we did the night leading up to it wasn't all that good. I hated sitting there alone with no one to talk to while waiting for some one to ask me to dance and work up the nerve to make a pass." 

 "You didn't need to wait. As I recall you do rather well in going after it." 

 "Yeah, but I had you there for moral support. Dan's ringing, got to go. I'll talk with you later." 

 It was an easy day and she pretty much just shuffled papers. Harvey called her at two and gave her the name of the attorney he was suggesting she used and when he hung up she called the attorney and made an appointment to see him. 

 At five she was waiting in the lobby when the limo pulled up out in front. It was a dinner, drinks and dancing night and when it was time to go Harvey handed her an envelope. 

 "I've got a late meeting to go to. Tony will take you home. I'll call you early next week and let you know the timing on your husband. It will be two weeks before I can get back here and I want you to use those two weeks thinking about my offer." 

 When Tony pulled into her drive and got out to open the door for her he said, "Good night Mrs. Baxter" and she only hesitated a fraction before saying, "Aren't you coming in with me?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Her head was on the pillow which raised her ass to just the right height for Tony to slide his cock in it. He was slowly easing into her when she had the thought. 

 "Stop lover; there is something that I want to do." 

 She pulled away from him and got the bedside phone and called the hotel where Jake was staying. When Jake answered she moved back and nodded to Tony to go back to ass fucking her. As Jake asked, "What's up babe? You don't usually call me" Tony was pushing his cock deep in her ass. 

 "I'm sorry to bother you honey, but for some reason tonight I'm feeling super lonesome." 

 She suppressed a moan as Tony slowly fucked her ass and then said, "I really am sorry to bother you honey, but I just had to hear your voice." 

 "I'm lonely too baby and believe me, I can't wait to get home." 

 Lonely my ass she thought. She knew he had some slut in his bed and it was only fitting that she have some one in hers. It felt good to know that she was putting one over on him while he was lying there rubbing his whore's tits and thinking how clever he was to be doing it while talking to his wife on the phone. Tony picked up the pace and she moaned. 

 "What was that" Jake asked. 

 "I'm masturbating while talking to you honey; that's how bad it is" and she moaned again. 

 "You are masturbating?" 

 "Here baby, listen to my fingers slap my clit" and she held the phone down close to her pussy so Jake could her the "slap, slap, slap" of Tony's balls hitting her ass on his in stroke. She brought the phone back up to her ear and said: 

 "I wish it was you instead of my fingers baby." 

 "I wish it were me there to babe. Don't wear it out. I'll be home Friday and take my turn." 

 "Oh shit! I've got to go honey. I'm almost there and I'm going to need both hands. Hurry home lover, hurry home." 

 She stuffed the phone under the pillow so Jake wouldn't hear her scream as Tony pushed her over the top. 

 When Tony dropped her off at work in the morning and she watched him drive away she wondered if Harvey was right. Did she enjoy being a slut? She had certainly been one last night. Then again, was she being a slut or just keeping her promise to herself to get laid every night that Jake was gone? She turned and entered the building and headed for her office. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 12 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She had been at her desk for maybe twenty minutes when Marci called. 

 "We still on for tonight?" 

 "I'm planning on it." 

 "Dan wants to see you around ten. Will you be free?" 

 "I'll try to squeeze him in." 

 "You are too tight or he is too big?" 

 "You are horrible!" 

 "It is all your fault. You are the one who got me going. Got some one on the other line. Talk to you later." 

 Dan looked up, smiled and pointed at the chair when she entered his office. She sat down and Dan said: 

 "I need a favor." 

 "You know that I'll do it if I can." 

 "You will be handling the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for the Bryns wedding right?" 

 "Yes." 

 "The father of the bride is an old friend of mine. There won't be an envelope in it for you, but I would appreciate it if you would take care of him after the dinner." 

 "Do I tell him you sent me?" 

 "No, but I will hint to him that you have been known to cheat on your husband and if I know him as well as I think I do he will hit on you. Just take it from there." 

 "He isn't fat and ugly is he?" 

 "Fat no, but ugly? That depends on your personal definition of what constitutes good looks." 

 "Oh goody - a blind date. Just what a girl my age needs." 

 "Oh give it up sweetie. A dick is a dick and it is another check mark in your book." 

 When she left Dan's office Marci asked her what time she wanted to leave and she said regular quitting time would do. 

 "Where do you want to go?" 

 "I think maybe Susie Q's. I had good luck the last time I was there." 

 The phone was ringing when she got back to her desk and she answered it. 

 "Fran? This is Pam; remember me?" 

 "Given what we did when we were last together it would be almost impossible to forget you. What can I do for you?" 

 "I wanted to invite you to a party tonight at my place." 

 "I wish I could say yes, but I have already committed myself to a girl's night out with my friend Marci so I'll have to pass, but thanks for thinking of me." 

 "Marci? Isn't that the girl who has the hots for my hubby?" 

 "That's her." 

 "She's invited too then." 

 "Given the way she feels about Bobby I don't think that would be a good idea." 

 "No problem there. Bobby won't be there; he is out of town on business." 

 "Oh? What kind of party is this?" 

 "Well...you remember what we did the last time we were together? It is that kind of party." 

 "And just how many party goers are we looking at?" 

 "At least enough to keep three healthy and active girls busy." 

 "Do I get to wear a silly little pointed party hat with a tassel on it?" 

 "No, but there should be plenty of whistles to toot." 

 "What time and how do we get there?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 "I don't know how I let you talk me into this" Marci said. "How can I party with the wife of the man who was meant to be mine?" 

 She had never mentioned to Marci that Pam had offered to share so she said, "Be nice to her and maybe - just maybe - she will let you play with her new hubby." 

 She rang the doorbell and a very naked Pam answered it. Pam gave her a hug and said: 

 "Thanks for coming. As you may have guessed I started without you." 

 She introduced Marci to Pam and then Pam took Marci's hand saying, "You and I have so much to talk about" and she pulled Marci along with her into a large family room where seven naked men with hard ons were standing around talking. 

 "Hey guys" Pam said as she walked into the room, "I've got reinforcements." She turned and said, "I was doing a 'round robin' when you rang the bell" 

 "A round robin?" asked Marci, "What is a round robin?" 

 "I'm on my knees and the guys are around me in a circle and I go from cock to cock and the last guy to cum is the winner." 

 "What does he win?" 

 "He gets to watch the first guy to cum do me." 

 "So the first guy to cum is really the winner?" 

 "Don't go getting technical on me." 

 "So how do we do a round robin with the three of us?" 

 "How about the first girl to get a guy to cum gets to pick the first guy to do her?" 

 Marci turned to her and said, "How does that sound?" 

 "It sounds like more check marks in my book" she said as she started to undress. 

 Marci won and picked a tall redhead and led him over to the couch and in less than thirty seconds she had her legs up on the guy's shoulders and he was driving into her. 

 Pam was the next one to get a mouthful of cum and she grabbed a hunky looking blond and led him over to the couch where she said something to Marci and then Marci and her guy got up and followed Pam and the blond out of the room. 

 She looked at the five men she was left with and made up her mind. Two of the guys had just cum in the mouths of Marci and Pam and that left her with three hard cocks. She did a quick "eeny, meeny, mineey, moe" and settled on a guy and moved to him. 

 "My knees hurt so no more of this moving around on the floor from cock to cock. I'm going to suck this one" and she took hold of the cock in front of her and then said, "and one of you two other hard dicks can do me from behind." 

 She leaned forward and took the cock in her mouth and seconds later she moaned as a hard cock slipped into her pussy. The guy in her pussy came first and when he pulled out of her the guy she was sucking moved to fill her pussy and even as his cock slid into her wet, slick cunt the last hard cock was at her mouth. Too bad Jake couldn't see her now she thought as she pushed back at the cock fucking her while her hand played with the balls of the guy she was deep throating. 

 The man in her pussy came, but before the man in her mouth could change positions she called a halt to things. 

 "Let's go find the others and a bed. I need to get up off this floor before I get carpet burns on my knees." 

 She and her five man fuck posse went looking for Pam and Marci and they found them in a bedroom on a king size bed only now the redhead was fucking Pam while the blond was doing Marci. The five of them stood there watching the action on the bed until Pam noticed them. 

 "There is another bedroom across the hall." 

 Marci looked over at the five and giggled. "I've got room for one more." 

 "Come to think of it so do I" Pam said and two of the five with her moved to the bed and a waiting Marci and Pam. 

 She turned to the guys still standing there with her and said, "It looks like you three are mine. Let's go find that other bed." 

 After that it was musical bedrooms as the seven guys did their best to take care of the three women. At one point she and Pam were watching as Marci did three guys; one in each of her holes. 

 "She is almost as big a slut as I am" Pam said. 

 "The girl does love to play. I take it from tonight that you and Bobby have decided on an open marriage?" 

 "Well, not really. We have kind of avoided talking about what happened the night before we got married. I think we both felt it might be better to wait until after the honeymoon to talk about it. Then when we got back we kind of have been pussy-footing around it." 

 "He does know what is going on here tonight, doesn't he?" 

 "No. Tonight wasn't planned; it just sort of happened." 

 "How?" 

 "Before Bobby and I married I expected that the marriage was only going to be one of convenience. I told you how it was, remember? Anyway, not expecting much from Bobby in the way of sex I told Jimmy and Bill that they could fuck me as much as they wanted after I got back from our honeymoon. Jimmy and Bill are the best man and usher I told you about. Well, they knew that Bobby was going out of town so they decided to take me up on my offer. They know me and they know my sexual appetite so they told Mark and Steve they were coming over and somehow the word got to Ralph, Sam and Hank and they all showed up. I couldn't send them away because I'd already promised Jimmy and Bill and I always keep my word. But I couldn't just let Jimmy and Bill stay and tell the others to go. So, like I said; tonight just sort of happened." 

 "What is Bobby going to think about it?" 

 "I don't plan on telling him about Jimmy and Bill. He doesn't know about me doing them before. I'll tell him about the other five because he doesn't know them all that well. I'll tell him that I made a couple of them promises before I knew how our marriage was going to be. I'll tell him what I just told you and then we will work it out. Before they leave I'll clue Jimmy and Bill in and let them know that things have changed. But that is later. Right now I see a couple of hard cocks that are not being used and I just cannot bring myself to let them go to waste. Shall we?" 

 Probably the most amazing thing to happen that night was the bond that formed between Pam and Marci. She saw the two of them sitting and talking and giggling together while she was being made airtight by Jimmy, Bill and Hank. 

 When it was over and she and Marci were driving back to where Marci had left her car Marci said: 

 "Pam told me that she was willing to share Bobby with me if I promised not to try and steal him away from her." 

 "I know." 

 "How could you know?" 

 "She told me that the day of the wedding." 

 "And you didn't tell me?" 

 "What? And get your hopes up? I decided that since I didn't know what kind of marriage that they were going to end up in I'd keep quiet and just wait and see. I still don't know and neither does Pam if Bobby is going to want to play or be a faithful husband. It isn't likely that he is going to be a faithful hubby since Pam says she isn't going to be a faithful wife, but it is still a wait and see situation." 

 Marci pouted the rest of the way to her car and as she was getting out of the car she said: 

 "You still should have told me." 

 "And what if he never called? No way I was going to set you up for a fall like that Marci. Goodnight." 

 When she got home she got out her notebook and added seven more check marks. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 During the rehearsal she checked out the father of the bride. He wasn't a movie star, but he wasn't bad looking. He looked fit and that was a mark in his favor. 

 After the dinner she handed out the free drink coupons and when she handed the father of the bride his he took her hand and said: 

 "Will you sit with me while I have this drink?" 

 "If you would like me to." 

 "Oh I do, I really, really do." 

 He didn't even finish his drink before he made his pitch and ten minutes later she was in his room and had his cock in her mouth. One more mark in the book she thought as she moved over him and impaled herself on his cock. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 13 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© As she settled in behind her desk on Monday morning she thought about her weekend. Jake had come home from his trip to Atlanta Friday evening and he had wanted to play. For the first time in months he was actually the first one to use her pussy. Dan had been out of town and there had been no other way for her to get herself laid before going home to Jake. As Jake did her she realized how much she hated giving Jake her body unless someone else had used it first. She knew she had to do it in order to keep him happy while she stabbed him in the back time after time after time, but she still didn't like it. 

 She was glad that it would soon be over. He would get his promotion and that would trigger the divorce and she would be rid of him. Her plan was simple. Harvey would tell her when they were giving Jake the promotion. The night before he received it she would feed him her pussy with another man's cum still inside of it and the next day when he came home beaming over his promotion she would hit him with the divorce papers. When the divorce was final she would hand Jake her little black book and explain to him what it was. Then it would be time to start a new life. Knowing that it would soon be over helped make sex with Jake bearable over the rest of the weekend. 

 Her day was fairly busy as she worked on the details for the two conventions that would take place that week. There was no wedding scheduled for the weekend which was probably a good thing since Jake would be home all week. With things finally coming together for her she could do without the argument that staying out for the rehearsal dinner would bring (to say nothing of having to go to the wedding if she didn't score at the rehearsal). She was only weeks away from it being over so she would try and keep things calm and easy. At two Marci called her and said that Dan wanted to see her. 

 "Is he in a good mood?" she asked Marci when she got to Dan's office. 

 "He seems to be and from the way he is acting I'm betting that he probably horny to." 

 "Why aren't you in there taking care of him?" 

 "Only when asked girlfriend, only when asked. Go on in." 

 Dan looked up at her and smiled when she walked into his office. "Two quick things sweetie; I have a friend I would like you to spend the afternoon with tomorrow. Is your desk clear enough to handle it?" 

 "As it looks right now I should be free." 

 "Good, good. The other thing is a little more immediate" he said as he stood up and pulled his zipper down. "I need some relief and I can't wait for this afternoon. You won't mind if I take you bent over my desk will you?" 

 She had to laugh at that. "You sure are a silver tongued devil" she said as she pulled her skirt up, pushed down her panty and stepped out of it. 

 Dan walked to the door and stuck his head outside long enough to say "No interruptions Marci" and then he closed the door and locked it. 

 While he was doing that she pushed aside what Dan had on the desk and then leaned over it and rested on her elbows. "Go easy" she said, "I'm not wet." 

 "I was a Boy Scout sweetie; be prepared and all that shit" and he opened the top drawer of his desk and took out a tube of KY Jelly. He coated his cock with some and then used his fingers to lube her up. Dan lined his cock up with her slit and she pushed back as he pressed forward and his cockhead slid into her. 

 "A little eager are we?" he asked. 

 "You seemed to be in a hurry and I just wanted to help." 

 The playful banter quickly turned into moans as Dan's hard cock speared into her. There were worse ways to start your work day she thought as the heat built up in her. Bent forward over the desk she was on her toes and not able to get much in the way of leverage, but even so she pushed back as best she could to meet Dan's thrusts. 

 "Oh Jesus Dan, yes, yes, yes" she moaned as she felt the orgasm. 

 The orgasm brought contractions and her cunt muscles squeezed Dan's cock and that made him cum. As he pulled his softening cock out of her he said: 

 "Thanks sweetie; I really did need that." 

 She turned, went to her knees and licked the wetness off of Dan's cock and then looked up at him and smiled as she said: 

 "I hope that this was just the appetizer." 

 "Oh you do, do you? I guess I'll just have to make sure that there is a room available this afternoon." 

 "I hope that's a promise. Jake is home all week and I really do love taking him a freshly fucked pussy." 

 Dan did meet her that afternoon and he fucked her twice before sending her home to her husband. That evening as Jake licked her clit she thought about how she was going to give him a pussy with fresh cum in it soon and the idea turned her on so much that her body gave a little shiver. Jake looked up from what he was doing and said: 

 "Like that, do you?" 

 She grabbed his head and pulled it to her pussy and growled, "Hell no I don't like it - I love it!" 

 Tuesday there was no sex with Dan because he wouldn't send her used to anyone he set her up with. She got an envelope with grand in it for an afternoon with Dan's friend from Cleveland and then had two orgasms that night when Jake ate her pussy. 

 Wednesday turned into a busy day for her as she got involved with two unions that were in a "turf" war over work being done to set up Ballroom A and the Aspen Room for a convention. When she left work and headed home she hoped that Jake wouldn't want sex that night. She hated having sex with him unless she was giving him "used" pussy. 

 He was on the phone when she walked in the door and she heard him say, "Got to go. The wife is home. I'll talk with you later." 

 When he hung up she thought for a second that he had a guilty look on his face. Probably talking to one of his honeys arranging to see her on his next trip. The thought that he might have been talking to one of his whores pissed her off and she said: 

 "You're on your own for dinner tonight. I have a hell of a headache and I'm going straight to bed. There are plenty of leftovers in the fridge" and she headed for the bedroom. 

 The rest of the week flew by. She took care of one of Dan's friends on Thursday and Dan himself on Friday, but both nights Jake didn't come to bed until after she had fallen asleep. 

 Saturday night she went with Jake to his company Christmas party which was being held in the warehouse section of the building where Jake worked. Both Harvey and Bobby were there, but she had to pretend that she didn't know them. They sat at the head table and she and Jake and another couple were at a table toward the back. As they walked by the head table Pam saw her and winked at her. 

 About halfway through the evening she saw Harvey get up and head toward the bathrooms so she got up to go to the ladies room. She was in the hall when Harvey came out of the men's room and she looked both ways to make sure that no one else was around and then she asked: 

 "Is there some place we can go for a quickie? I want to do it while Jake is so close." 

 He laughed, "There is that deliciously slutty mind at work again" and he took her hand and led her to a door. "This is the production manager's office. You want it bent over the desk or lying on it?" he said as he closed and locked the door behind him. 

 "Whatever will be the quickest for you." 

 "On your back then." 

 She raised her skirt and pushed down her panties and stepped out of them. She lifted herself up on the desk and waited for Harvey to step out of his trousers. He moved up to the desk, lifted her legs up onto his shoulders and slowly started to ease his cock into her pussy as she moaned and cooed: 

 "Oh yes lover; oh yes!" 

 As Harvey was unlocking the door she said, "Have Bobby meet me here in thirty minutes." 

 "I don't know if he can get away from Pam." 

 "Ask him and if he doesn't show he doesn't show, but I would like to give Jake pussy tonight that has been used by both you and Bobby. Is Tony here?" 

 "No. He doesn't like these kinds of affairs so I gave him the night off." 

 "Oh well, I would have liked doing the three of you, but I guess I'll just have to settle for what I can get." 

 When she got back to the table Jake was talking to some guy she didn't recognize about sales ratios and quotas or some such thing and it didn't seem like he even missed her. Ten minutes after she got back he moved over to a table with three other guys were sitting and started talking business and he hadn't come back by the time for her to head for the production manager's office to see if Bobby were there. 

 The door was locked and she tapped on it lightly twice and seconds later Harvey opened the door and beyond him she could see Bobby. Bobby already had his pants off and his hard on was bobbing in anticipation. 

 "Hurry" Bobby said, "I need to get back to Pam before she misses me." 

 "Oh oh" she thought as she stepped out of her panties for the second time that night, "Does not sound like Bobby and Pam have discussed the open marriage thing." But Bobby was hard and ready and she decided that she would worry about Pam later. She got up on the desk and Bobby lifted her legs up onto his shoulders and slid his cock into her. As Bobby's cock entered her Harvey positioned himself so he could get his cock into her mouth. Bobby fucked her fast and furious and he came before she was even close to an orgasm. He pulled out and said: 

 "Sorry baby, but I have to get back before I'm missed." 

 He pulled on his pants and headed for the door. Harvey followed him and locked the door after Bobby left and then he cam back and took Bobby's place between her legs. He brought her to orgasm, got himself off and then said: 

 "I think we need to get back. I'll be in town Wednesday and Thursday. Can you fit me in?" 

 She laughed. "Into my busy schedule or into me?" 

 "You know damned well what I'm asking." 

 "Maybe in the afternoons, but the evenings are out. Jake is supposed to be in town all week." 

 "I'll take care of that. Figure on the evenings." 

 Back at the table it was obvious that Jake hadn't missed her and even though she had reached the point where she could hardly stand to look at him it still pissed her off that he ignored her. 

 Then she had a thought - a bad thought. She had not planned for what happened with Harvey and Bobby. She would need to get clean before getting Jake to go down on her. She could get most of it with paper towels in the bathroom, but she wouldn't be able to get the stuff up inside her - the stuff that would flow down as she walked and danced and stood around talking or when she got excited and her own juices started flowing. She would need her douche bag to get really clean, but how to do that without making Jake wonder why? She didn't see any way that she could do it. As much as she hated letting a chance to feed Jake used pussy go by she would just have to take a pass on having sex with Jake when she got home. 

 She was at the punch bowl filling her glass when Pam joined her and asked: 

 "Are you doing anything special for lunch on Monday?" 

 "No. As far as I know I don't have anything on for Monday." 

 "Have lunch with me at Marco's at noon?" 

 Can do that." 

 "Good. I need to talk to you. I have a problem and you seem to have the touch when it comes to helping me with my problems." 

 "What kind of problems?" 

 "Bobby problems. Got to go. See you Monday." 

 Back at the table Jake asked, "Why were you talking to that blond bimbo?" 

 "Who? Pam? How do you know she's a bimbo?" 

 "Cause she's married to that asshole son of the boss." 

 "He is an asshole so it is automatic that she is a bimbo?" 

 "Yeah. Why were you talking to her?" 

 "Just making conversation. She introduced herself and said she was trying to meet new people. Said she felt weird sitting at the head table and not knowing another soul in the building. She seems nice. I don't know why you think she's a bimbo." 

 "What other kind would the dipshit marry?" 

 "You certainly don't sound like a big fan of his." 

 "I'm not. I'm busting my ass to go somewhere in this company and that little turd just walks in and becomes a vice-president for no other reason than he is the owner's brat." 

 "If he is a VP then somewhere along the way you are going to be working for him and you would be wise to hide your dislike or you just might find yourself out on your ass." 

 "I can't help it. The dipshit just grinds on me." 

 As soon as Jake said that she knew that she was going to take a chance and let him eat her pussy when they got home. What could be better than letting him have a taste of someone he disliked so much. If she could get a couple of more drinks in him - strong ones, doubles or even triples - he might not even notice that it wasn't her natural juices he was licking up. If she got enough booze in him he might not be able to screw her, but she didn't care about that anyway. What did it for her was Jake eating her pussy after someone else had played in it. 

 She managed to get enough alcohol in Jake to get him in the condition she wanted him in, but by then she was in no condition to drive so she had to call a cab to get them home from the party. Jake was ambulatory - just barely - and she got him into the house and up to the bedroom. She helped him undress and then she undressed herself and pulled him onto the bed with her. 

 "Get me ready baby, get me wet and ready." 

 She guided his head to her pussy and he licked and sucked and never said a word about how wet and juicy she was or about the taste. She wished that she hadn't cleaned out what she had. It would have been just marvelous for Jake to have sucked it all up. 

 Sunday Jake was an absolute bear! He had the mother of all hangovers and she just stayed out of his way all day and that evening he went to bed before she did and he was sound asleep when she slid onto the bed next to him. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Pam was already at the restaurant when she got there. 

 "Thanks for coming Fran. I really do appreciate it." 

 "So what is this Bobby problem you have?" 

 "I don't think he likes being married to a slut. I would have thought that after the night at your place and the limo ride after he would know what he was getting for a wife. For Christ's sake Fran, he drove the limo while his father and Tony tried to fuck me senseless on the back seat and seven hours later he married me anyway." 

 "You haven't talked about it with him?" 

 "Every time I try and bring it up he changes the subject or gets up and goes somewhere." 

 "You were alone for two weeks on your honeymoon and it was never mentioned?" 

 "Not once. The last word on the subject was at the end of the limo ride. Bobby pulled up and parked and said, "We're here" and I said, "Just a couple of more minutes; I need to finish these guys" and Bobby said, "Damn!" All we did on our honeymoon was play and make love. It was like we had an unspoken agreement not to say anything until the honeymoon was over. Now the honeymoon is over and I can't get him to talk about it. When he got back from this last trip I told him about our little party and he didn't say anything; he just got up and left the room." 

 "I wish I'd known all this the night that you, I and Marci partied." 

 "Why?" 

 "I would have left Bobby alone at the Christmas party." 

 "You did Bobby at the party?" 

 "Bobby and Harvey both." 

 "And your husband was there? Did he join in?" 

 "Not hardly. I guess you don't know about Jake." 

 She told Pam about what was going on where Jake was concerned and why she did what she was doing. 

 "So you did Bobby and Harvey and then went home and fucked your husband?" 

 "He had so much booze in him that he couldn't get it up, but I had him eat my pussy. I just wish I hadn't cleaned most of Bobby and Harvey out of me before going home." 

 "But the fact is that Bobby did do you and that means that his mindset isn't "We are married now so no more of this playing around stuff." 

 "He did rush a bit and he said the reason was that he had to get back to you before you missed him." 

 "Why? That doesn't make sense. Why would he want to hide it from me when I'd already told him what I had done with you and Marci?" 

 "I don't know Pam; that is something that you are going to have to pull out of Bobby." 

 "How? I can't get him to talk to me about it." 

 "Then we will just have to put him in a situation where he will have to talk about it. I've an idea, but I'll probably have to involve Harvey." 

 "You worked miracles for me last time so I'm going to trust that you can do it again." 

 "No promises Pam, but I'll try." 

 She had been back at her desk about an hour when Jake called her and told her he was going to have to fly to Atlanta that afternoon. She had been expecting the call since Harvey had told he would be in town during the week and would see to it that Jake wouldn't be a problem. The news didn't bother her since Dan was out of the office for the day and he hadn't set her up with anyone. If Jake was home he would have wanted sex and she would have had to avoid it somehow since her new posture was that Jake only got used pussy and it looked as if the day was going to be a bust as far as her being "used" was concerned. But then again Jake wasn't going to be home and it was also her policy to get laid every night that Jake was out of town. She smiled and picked up the phone and punched in a number. 

 "Hey Marci; doing anything tonight? 

 To be continued…  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 14 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She was late getting to work on Tuesday. She'd lost track of time playing with Pete and Darin, the two boys she and Marci had hooked up with the night before and she had rushed home, showered and changed before hurrying to work. There was a note on her desk telling her to call Marci ASAP. 

 "Hey girlfriend, whatcha need?" 

 "Dan needs to see you right away. What is going on? You are never late." 

 "You know what is going on. You are the one who bailed out and left me with two oversexed young hunks. I had a hell of a time getting away from them." 

 "Not my fault sweetie. You know when we go out together that I have to quit in time to beat Frank home. If you don't want to leave when I do you know that you will have to take up the slack." 

 "What does Dan want?" 

 "Haven't got a clue. He just told me to get you into his office as soon as you got here." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 "What does your day look like" Dan asked her as soon as she walked into his office. 

 "Nothing major. I have some contracts to review and I need to do some set up work on the Cole wedding this coming Saturday." 

 "Could you have it all cleared up by noon?" 

 "I suppose I could. What's up?" 

 "Jared is flying in from Chicago. He gets here at eleven, plans on being here through Thursday and he specifically asked for you." 

 "You have a problem then. Harvey is going to be in town tomorrow and Thursday and I've already committed to spending those days with him. Or at least those evenings." 

 "So you could take care of Jared today and during the day on Wednesday and Thursday?" 

 "Today yes, but no on the rest. I won't take Harvey sloppy seconds." 

 "Ouch! This puts me between a rock and a hard place. I don't want Jared or Harvey pissed at me, but it doesn't look like I can avoid it." 

 "It shouldn't be a problem for you. I can handle Jared. I'll just tell him he should have let me know sooner that he was coming. That way I would have known not to make other commitments. Where am I meeting him?" 

 "Here in the restaurant at 12:30. That will take care of today, but I'll need to find someone for the next two and I hope he won't be too disappointed." 

 As she was on her way back to her desk the idea came to her and she turned around and went back to Dan's office. She stuck her head inside the door and said: 

 "Hold off on finding someone else for Jared until I get back to you. I think I have a way to take care of the problem." 

 Back at her desk she made several phone calls and inside of thirty minutes she was down to needing only one thing to make her plan happen and she was sure enough of getting that one thing that she called Dan and told him that the Jared problem had been taken care of. She looked at her watch and saw that she had just a little over two hours to get her desk cleared before she had to meet Jared. 

 The afternoon went pretty much as expected. Jared met her in the hotel dining room where they had lunch and talked and then she surprised him by taking him home with her. 

 "I get all hot inside when I do my lovers on my husband's bed." 

 She undressed him and then sat him down on the bed and then did a slow strip tease for him. When her dress hit the floor and she was standing in front of him in just heels, bra and thong panties he was sitting there stroking an already hard cock. She walked over to him and bent down to take him in her mouth as she removed what little she still had on. Knowing his tastes she left the heels on and the she pushed him onto his back and moved over the top of him. She used her right hand to guide him into her as she sank down on him. When she had him fully inside she began to rock back and forth and slide up and down on him and she continued it until he was so close to getting off that he rolled her over onto her back, lifted her legs up onto his shoulders and then started fucking her hard. She had a very hard orgasm and just seconds later he had his climax. 

 He fell to the bed beside her and for several seconds they laid there gasping for breath and then she moved her hand slowly down his body and started fondling his cock. She felt it twitch in her hand and she giggled and moved her head down and took him in her mouth. He was hard in minutes and she pulled him on top of her and they did it again. A shower, followed by a light dinner was followed by two more romps with a sixty-nine between them and then the two of them fell asleep. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Wednesday was a busy day for her and she couldn't get away from work until 5: 30. She hurried home and got busy getting ready and at 6:30 the doorbell rang and when she opened the door Harvey and Bobby were standing there. She stepped forward and kissed both of them and then stepped aside to let them in. 

 "Should I wave for Tony to come in?' Harvey asked her. 

 "You know the answer to that one lover." 

 "Yes, I suppose I do. What is it you are always telling me? Oh yeah, that you are on my time." 

 He waved for Tony to join them and said, "He got a big charge out of doing you while wearing your husband's clothes." 

 She led the three into the kitchen where she had set up a veggie tray and a meat and cheese tray. She told them that there was beer in the refrigerator, wine on the counter and stronger stuff in the cabinet above the stove. Harvey got a beer out of the fridge and then asked: 

 "Okay, now what is this big secret that you have for me?" 

 "Come in the living room and I'll tell you." 

 They left Bobby and Tony in the kitchen picking over the meat and cheese tray and went out and sat down on the couch. 

 "Please don't be too pissed at me, but I am meddling in your family affairs again." 

 "What did you do this time?" 

 The doorbell rang and she looked at her watch and said, "There she is. Right on time." 

 She went to the door and let Marci in and said, "He's in the kitchen." 

 Marci gave her a hug and said, "Thank you Fran, thank you, thank you, thank you" and then she was her way to the kitchen. 

 She went back and sat back down with Harvey and he asked, "All right sweetie, what are you doing now?" 

 She told him about the talk she'd had with Pam over lunch. "They have to sit down and talk Harv. I'm hoping that I can make it happen. I really like the both of them and I want to see them work it out. I promise that if tonight doesn't work I'll walk away from it and I won't meddle any more." 

 "That still doesn't tell me what you are doing." 

 "Just wait and watch lover. Just trust me and wait and watch." 

 They were all on the king size bed and she was on her knees and elbows while Harvey slowly fucked her butt and next to her on the bed Marci had Tony in her pussy and Bobby in her mouth when: 

 "God damn it! This is the second time you started without me." 

 All eyes turned to the bedroom door and saw Pam standing there with Jared. 

 "Shit! There isn't even any room for me on the bed. Come on baby; we will use the bedroom across the hall" and she took Jared's hand and led him away. 

 Bobby watched them go and the look on his face was priceless. He was in the middle of a fantastic blow job that he didn't want to stop, but at the same time he was drawn to follow his wife and see just what the hell she was up to. Wife won over blow job but he hadn't counted on Marci and when he started to pull away from her mouth she reached out and dug her nails into his ass cheeks and held him there. The only way he was going to get away from her was to cum so he grabbed her head and started fucking her face. He had already been close so it didn't take long for him to get off and as soon as Marci released him he was off the bed and out the bedroom door heading after his wife. 

 "What now" Harvey asked her. 

 "Now? Now it is in the hands of the Gods." 

 Harvey finished in her butt and then the two of them got up and walked across the hall and looked in the spare bedroom door. Jared was fucking her from behind and Bobby had his cock in her mouth. She looked at Harvey. 

 "At least they aren't fighting. Come on lover; let me wash your cock so I can do some work on it to get you hard again." 

 Then things got busy. With the exception of Marci, who tried hard to monopolize Bobby, the rest of them played "musical holes" as the men rotated through the women. Marci had to leave at 10:15 and that made four men and two women and by midnight she and Pam had reduced the men to quivering wrecks. Nothing that she or Pam could do would produce another hard on. Worn out, the six of them went to bed; Pam, Bobby and Tony in the one bedroom and Harvey, Jared and she in the other. 

 The alarm woke her and she reached for Harvey's cock and as it stirred she lowered her head and took it in her mouth. Harvey came fully awake and pulled her up on him and she settled down on him and rode him until he came. By then Jared was awake and as she got off the bed he said: 

 "How about me?" 

 She laughed and said, "The girl that brung you is across the hall. I have to shower and get ready to go to work." 

 By the time she was ready to leave everyone had moved to the king size bed in her bedroom. Pam was riding her husband's cock while Tony worked his cock in her ass and Jared used her mouth. 

 "You going to join in" she asked Harvey. 

 "As soon as there is an opening. Are we still on for tonight?" 

 "I get off at five. Make sure you lock up when you leave." 

 She kissed him and headed off for work. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 There was a lot on her desk and the day flew by as she tried to get most of the work done before leaving to meet Harvey. At 3 PM Dan asked her if things with Jared were going to work out and she told him that she had it covered and she hoped that she did. Her deal with Pam was that in exchange for putting her and Bobby into a situation where they had to talk Pam would take care of Jared while he was in town. Marci had agreed to be backup if things between Pam and Bobby turned to shit and Pam had to cancel. She had not heard from Pam so she assumed that everything was all right. 

 At 4:30 Harvey called and told her he would meet her in the hotel restaurant when she got off work. He was sitting at a table next to the windows when she got there. After they had ordered he asked: 

 "You up to a quiet evening in tonight?" 

 "Whatever you want baby; you know I'm...." 

 "I know, I know; you are on my time, but it won't kill me to do what you want to do for a change." 

 "I'd like a quiet evening." 

 "I gambled that you would and I gave Tony the night off. You get to drive. You prefer the condo or your place?" 

 "My place is closer and you know how I feel about other men being in hubby's bed." 

 After a leisurely dinner she drove them to her place. She got him a beer and they sat on the couch and talked for a while and then they went to bed and made love twice before falling asleep cuddled up next to each other. They made love in the morning and then showered together and then she drove him to his 'in town' office. When he went to hand her the envelope she waved it away. 

 "I think you and I have reached a point where that isn't necessary any more." 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "Because I look on you as a very good friend now." 

 He was silent for a moment and then he handed her the envelope and said: "I want you to have it any way. Call it a finder's fee or a commission." 

 "For what?" 

 "Well, your little party Wednesday night put me together with Jared and it turns out that we will be doing some business together." 

 He leaned over and kissed her, said "I'll be in touch" and got out of the car. She didn't count what was in the envelope but she did stop at the bank on the way to work and put the envelope in her safe deposit box. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As soon as she was in the building she headed for Dan's office to check in with Marci. When she got there Marci was all smiles. 

 "I didn't get to have him all to myself, but I did get to see him so thank you for that." 

 "Did Pam call you and ask you to take care of Jared?" 

 "No." 

 "Good. That means everything went well. At least I hope it did. No news is good news, right?" 

 "What do you have going for tonight? Can you stop for a drink?" 

 "No can do tonight. I've got the Cole wedding rehearsal. I hate it when they do it the day before the wedding, but half of the wedding party is from out of town and tonight is the only night they could all be here together." 

 "Bummer! I was hoping you could stop." 

 "Why? You plan on hunting tonight?" 

 "No. Frank will be home so I can't go out and play. Of course I wouldn't say no to a backseat quickie if I could still be home by seven." 

 "You are such a slut!" 

 "Says the slut who taught me everything I know." 

 Her phone was ringing when she walked into her office. She picked it up and it was Jake. He was facing a full day and wouldn't be able to catch a flight until noon on Saturday. She couldn't pass up chance to take a dig at him so she snarled into the phone, "I'm getting to hate that fucking job of yours!" and she hung up on him. She smiled as she set the phone down into the cradle and wondered how he took her abrupt ending of the phone call not that she really cared. She was ready - more than ready - for her farce of a marriage to be over. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She stood in the back and watched the rehearsal. Actually, it wasn't the rehearsal that she was looking at; she was checking out the men in the wedding party. There were only two she had no interest in - the father of the bride and the father of the groom. The were both fat, balding and totally unappealing. Two of the ushers were hunks and so were the groom and best man. The other ushers were okay and if she had to settle for one of them she wouldn't be all that upset. 

 As soon as the rehearsal was over she handed out the complimentary drink coupons and then went to the lounge and took a seat at the end of the bar and waited to see how things would shake out. The wedding party came in and pushed several tables together and sat down. All the men seemed to be paired up. She sipped her margarita and watched to see if any of the pairs would break up, but after forty-five minutes it looked like her string was going to be broken unless she could hook up with a wedding guest on Saturday. 

 Some slid on the barstool next to her and she heard, "What's a hot honey like you doing sitting here all alone?" 

 She turned and saw that it was the father of the groom. Fat, balding and unappealing. 

 "I'm sitting here waiting for some one." 

 "He must be a fool! Only a fool would leave a fox like you sitting alone. You have been sitting her for over forty-five minutes now." 

 "You've been watching me?" 

 "Hell yes I've been watching you. I told you that you were a fox. Half the men in her have been looking at you." 

 "And you felt it necessary to come over here to tell me that I've been sitting here alone for that long?" 

 "Hell no honey. I'm over here to try my luck. Take a shot at you and see if maybe I can get lucky." 

 "I don't suppose you have noticed my rings?" 

 "Oh yeah; I seen them, but they don't mean nothing. My wife wore her rings too and she was the biggest whore around. So, how about it? Want to have some fun?" 

 Fat, bald and crass, but he was available and she really did want to keep her string going. And then she thought, "Yes, I do want to keep it going, but do I want it this bad?" 

 Nah! 

 She smiled at him and said, "Maybe you will have better luck with those ladies at the other end of the bar" and she got up and left the lounge. 

 As she was walking across the lobby on the way to the parking lot she saw one of the ushers talking to one of the bridesmaids. Suddenly the girl slapped the usher and stormed off. Sensing an opportunity she walked up to him and asked: 

 "Are you okay?" 

 "I'm fine, just living proof that honesty is not always the best policy." 

 "I take it that she didn't like something that you said." 

 "Oh she most definitely didn't like it" he said as he rubbed his jaw, "and she sure packs a wallop." 

 "I'd offer to kiss it and make it better, but I don't know you well enough. Maybe if I bought you a drink we could change that." 

 "I sure could use a stiff one right now." 

 "Funny, so could I." 

 "What?" 

 "Nothing. Come on; let's see what a drink can do for you." 

 Later, as she watched Steve dress she said, "You never did tell me why she slapped you." 

 "She was my girlfriend and I found out she was fucking another guy and I walked away from her. This wedding tossed us together for the first time since I walked. She wanted to know what happened to me and why I'd never called and I told her what I'd found out and I'd never called because she was a slut and I wanted nothing to do with her. I guess she didn't like being called a slut." 

 "And yet here you are with me." 

 "Yeah, but being with a slut is a whole lot different from having a slut. No offence meant here, but while you might be a slut you aren't mine. You are some other dude's problem." 

 "So you don't mind sluts, you just don't want one of your own." 

 "That's it in a nutshell. You are great in the sack and if you want to give me your number I'd like to do it again." 

 "How about we treat this as two ships passing in the night and let it go at that." 

 "Suits me. Take care" and then he was gone. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The house was clean, the laundry done and she had a meat loaf in the oven when Jake got home. She pretended to be happy to see him and they hugged and kissed. 

 "How long before dinner" Jake asked. 

 "I just put the meat loaf in the oven so it will be an hour at least. Why?" 

 "It has been almost a week baby and I'd like to use some of that hour to help play 'catch up' if you know what I mean." 

 It was what she had hoped for. It had been just a little over twelve hours since Steve had come in her three times and she hadn't showered or douched. She'd had to use the bathroom three times since her evening with Steve and while urinating probably took out a good part of what Steve had left in her there would hopefully still be some traces of his sperm still left. 

 "That's a great idea sweetie. I've missed your magic mouth." 

 She looked down at him as he licked and slurped at her pussy and thought about what it was going to be like to give him a fresh fucked pussy full of fresh cum. She was determined to do it the night before she hit him with the divorce paperwork. All she needed was to know when he would get his promotion so she could time things. 

 Either no trace of Steve remained or Jake didn't notice because he ate her to orgasm without saying a word. Then they had sex and after cumming in her Jake started to move up so she could use her mouth to get him hard again, but she moved and got out of bed. 

 "No more" she said, "until after dinner." 

 "Oh come on sweetie." 

 "We have all evening and all night Jake. I'm hungry and I'm ready for dinner." 

 "To hell with dinner" he said reaching for her and taking hold of her arm. 

 She jerked away from him and snarled, "God damn it Jake; I said no!" 

 Hopefully, she thought, that will set the tone for the rest of the evening. She did not want to suck his cock especially after he had just spent the night with one of his whores. She had gotten what she wanted. He had eaten her well used pussy and as far as she was concerned they were done for the night. 

 Dinner was a silent affair and when they were done eating Jake disappeared into his basement workshop leaving her to wash and put away the dinner dishes. She went to bed early and pretended to be asleep when he came to bed. He made no attempt to wake her and that suited her just fine. 

 In the morning he woke her by sucking on her breasts and finger fucking her and she let him have sex with her before getting out of bed. She managed to get through the day without barking at him and that night neither of them made and sexual overtures.  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 14 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© To be continued…  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 15 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Monday was a slow day and it was going to be a slow week. There were no weddings scheduled for the weekend and only three events were going to be held in the ballrooms or conference rooms. At ten Pam called her and invited her to lunch and at eleven-thirty she slid onto the seat across from Pam in the booth. After they had ordered Pam said: 

 "Well, we had our talk for all the good it did." 

 "That doesn't sound very encouraging." 

 "It isn't. He flat out told me he doesn't love me. He loves having sex with me, but he only married me because his father expected it of him. He was surprised when I told him that I married him because I loved him and not because of our parents grand dreams of a family and business merger. 

 "I asked him if there was any chance he could learn to love me and he said no. He told me that he was already in love with someone, but she was unobtainable because of the fact that she was already married and so was he. I pressed and found out that the object of his affections is none other than your friend Marci. In the end we agreed to keep up appearances and turn a blind eye towards each others affairs. I'm right back where I was before the wedding; in love with a guy who thinks of me as a sister. The only difference is that he apparently doesn't mind committing incest with me. He doesn't love me, but he loves fucking me. At least I'll have that much of him." 

 "What a mess. Oh God honey, I'm so sorry." 

 "Don't be Fran. Thanks to you we got it all out into the open. We both know each other a lot better now. If it hadn't been for you we would have gotten married and the ended up cheating on each other behind each others backs. This way we are together and have an open marriage and for me that is better than nothing. Plus, as long as we are married and living together I have the opportunity to work on him. I'm not going to give up Fran. I have half of him now and I'll work on getting to other half. You going to tell Marci?" 

 "Good God no! That would only mess things up even more." 

 She told Pam about how Marci felt about Bobby, "And if I told her what you just told me she would divorce her husband tomorrow and for what? You won't give him up because you love him and Bobby won't leave you because it would upset the merger apple cart and piss off his father and your father. Oh no Pam; if Marci ever finds out it won't be from me." 

 They finished lunch and she went back to her office. She felt bad for Pam and couldn't help but wonder if Pam and Bobby wouldn't have been better off if she had never gotten involved. She was sitting there wondering how things might have turned out had she not invited Pam to join them that first time when the telephone rang. It was Harvey. Jake was going to be offered his promotion to the Atlanta office on Wednesday. She thanked him for the heads up, made a phone call to her attorney and then went to Dan's office and let him know that she was taking the rest of the afternoon off and then said: 

 "If you can set me up for something tomorrow I would appreciate it. If not, can you keep yourself available?" 

 "What's up?" 

 "Tomorrow I need to feed Jake his first pussy full of another man's cum." 

 "What if he notices?" 

 "Won't matter. I'm serving him with divorce papers on Wednesday." 

 "You can forget about me setting you up with someone. I want to get in on this. We can do it just before you leave work so it will be nice and fresh." 

 She left work and stopped by her attorney's office and picked up a copy of the divorce paperwork and then she headed home. She had a nice dinner fixed and ready for him when Jake got home from work and she was so lovey-dovey that it was almost sickening. 

 When they went to bed Jake wanted to fool around, but she told him no. 

 "I have an appointment with my gynecologist tomorrow and I have to be really, really clean when I see him or (and she giggled) he sees me. I'll make it up to you tomorrow." 

 Most of Tuesday was spent in reviewing contracts and doing some preliminary work on events that would be taking place over the next few weeks. At 3 p.m. Dan called her and told her to meet him in room 719. She entered the room and found him already naked and lying on the bed. His erection was pointing up at the ceiling and as she closed the door behind her she said: 

 "Is that for me?" 

 Dan fucked her three times and they both would have liked to do it one more time, but she needed to be home when Jake got there so she got up and got dressed. She thanked Dan on behalf of Jake for the gift he was sending Jake and then hurried home. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When Jake got home at six she was waiting for him in a black lace night gown and "come fuck me" pumps with four inch heels. Jake took one look at her and smiled. 

 "Dinner going to be a little late tonight?" 

 "If we even get to it." 

 She turned and walked to the bedroom and Jake followed. She moved to the bed, turned and slowly let the night gown slide off her shoulders. "You like?" she asked as she cupped her breasts in her hands. 

 "Do I ever!" 

 He stripped as she got on the bed and spread her legs wide. "Come on baby; turn me on the way I love." 

 Jake climbed on the bed and his mouth went straight to her pussy and the feeling that she had knowing that Jake would be sucking up Dan's cum was almost enough to give her an orgasm. Jake's tongue delved into her and her body shivered. 

 "Like that, do you?" 

 "Oh God yes baby, I love it when you eat me." 

 Jake went back to work on her pussy and it was a good two minutes before he raised his head up and looked at her. 

 "You taste funny and you are extremely wet." 

 "It is probably the douche making me taste different and I'm wet because I have been extremely horny for two days now." 

 "Douche? Why did you douche before making love?" 

 "The doctor shot me full of dye for one of the tests and then the nurse gave me the douche to get the dye out of me. I knew we would be making love so I asked the nurse about the douche and she told me that some men like the taste of it. She told me her husband loved the added flavor. What's wrong baby; is it upsetting you?" 

 "No. It is just that you taste different and I wondered about it." 

 "Well honey; if it bothers you, you don't have to do it." 

 Jake hesitated a second or so and then he went back to licking and sucking on her pussy. She smiled as she thought, "That's it you mother fucker, clean Dan out of me" and then she had her first orgasm and it was brought on as much by knowing she was feeding Jake another man's cum as it was by Jake's tongue and mouth action. Jake ate her for another two minutes and then she moaned: 

 "Fuck me baby; I need your hard cock in me." 

 She was thinking "Hurry, I want you to feel sloppy seconds on your dick" as he slid his cock into her. And then she turned it loose and tried to fuck his brains out. It would be their last time and she wanted to give him something to remember - something he could look back on and be sorry that he had tossed it away. She fucked him five times that night - the most they had ever done - and she was trying for six, but her mouth just could not get him back up and all the while he was trying to push her away saying: 

 "Enough Fran; enough already!" 

 Oh yeah! He would remember all right! 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was sitting at her desk and reading a memo from Dan. "How ironic" she thought. The memo informed her that there would be a meeting in his office Friday at ten to discuss the details of the up-coming Daimler/Parsons wedding. It was the cancelled Daimler/Parsons meeting that set in motion the events that would later on that day culminate in her dropping divorce papers on Jake. 

 The phone rang and when she answered it was Harvey on the line. 

 "He was offered the promotion and he took it. He was told he needed to be in Atlanta on the tenth and he said there wouldn't be any problem with that." 

 "There won't be. He could probably report there in the next day or two since I'll be kicking him out of the house tomorrow. I wanted to do it tonight but the lawyer told me it would be better if we did it tomorrow." 

 "How are you going to do it?" 

 "He will come home happy as all get out and give me the good news and then I'll give him the bad news. I'll hand him a copy of the divorce papers, but the attorney says that my giving them to him is just more or less for show. It appears that my handing him the papers carries no weight in the law so tomorrow a regular process server will give him the official set which, by the way, will include the restraining order that the attorney wouldn't give me a copy of. Anyway, when he leaves the house tomorrow he won't be coming back unless it is a court supervised visit." 

 "So what will you do once you have booted him out of your life?" 

 "For one thing I'll stop my wholesale whoring. Once Jake is history I won't need any more check marks in my little black book. In fact, I'll probably become a pretty good imitation of a nun. At least until the divorce is final." 

 "Why would you do that?" 

 "I sued for divorce using infidelity as grounds. Jake will be looking for something he can use to counter-sue, at least he will be if he gets a half way decent attorney and does what the attorney tells him. My attorney suggested that I be as pure as the driven snow until the divorce is over. You are the one who recommended him and told me how good he was. I would be foolish to ignore his advice." 

 "Do you really think you can go without sex for as long as the divorce is going to take?" 

 "I didn't say that I was going to go without. I said I'm not going to go out playing." 

 "I don't get what you are saying." 

 "No more bars, no more wedding party hook-ups, no more afternoon or evening dates set up by Dan. But if you were to come to town and take a room at the hotel the chances are damned good that sometime during the day little ole me will show up at your door. Whoever Jake has following me will follow me to work and then will wait outside to follow me when I leave work. He won't have a clue about what I do from 9 to 5 inside the building." 

 "I still think you should come to work for me." 

 "I wouldn't be what you want Harv. You want a slut, but my slut days are over when I'm rid of Jake. I only did what I did so I could throw it in his face. On the day the divorce is final Jake gets the whole story, but my time as a slut ends when I hand him the divorce papers tonight." 

 "The offer will always be there sweetie. I'll talk with you later." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She had dinner ready when Jake got home. She was surprised that he was quiet and somber. She had expected him to be happy and ready to share his good news. She didn't even get the usual kiss on the cheek. 

 "Bad day at work?" 

 "No, not bad at all." 

 "Then what seems to have you down?" 

 "Just something that I have to do. I've been putting it off until the right moment and I guess now is as right as the moment is going to get and it is proving to be harder to do than I thought." 

 "Does it have anything to do with us?" 

 "Yes it does." 

 She was thinking that he knew she wasn't going to be all that keen on moving to Atlanta and he was wondering how to break the news to her so she said: 

 "Just spit it out Jake; it can't be that bad." 

 "I'm afraid that it is." 

 "For Christ's sake Jake, out with it!" 

 He took a deep breath, "I've been spending a lot of time in Atlanta for the company. Well, the thing is that I've met somebody; somebody I'd rather be with. I want a divorce." 

 She sat there stunned and looked across the table at him. This wasn't the way it was supposed to happen. He was supposed to be happy over his promotion so she could rain on his parade with the divorce papers. Then she would smile sweetly at him as he looked all confused. It wasn't working out that way. 

 "Divorce? You want a divorce?" she said as she stood up from the table and walked over to the kitchen counter. She picked up a large envelope and turned back to him. 

 "You want a divorce? Your wish is my command" she said as she threw the envelope at him. "You can sleep in the spare bedroom tonight, but I want your ass out of here in the morning." 

 She was in the bedroom fuming when Jake came into the bedroom waving the divorce papers. "What the fuck is this infidelity shit? And I'm not moving out of this house." 

 Do the names Sarah Gilman and Joan Feldman ring a bell asshole?" 

 "You had me followed?" 

 "Bet your ass I did. After I caught you with that slut at the beach I knew you were a cheating bastard and I set out to get all the proof I could get to use in court when I filed for divorce." 

 "What slut at the beach?" 

 She told him how she had gotten loose from work and had rushed to the beach to try and save the weekend and then she told him what she had seen from the dive shop window. 

 "If you have known since then why haven't you done anything before now?" 

 "I was waiting for your big promotion and raise. The more you were making the higher my alimony would be. I just got tired of waiting. I don't believe there ever was a promotion. It was just a fucking excuse to cover all of your screwing around." 

 "Well I'm not leaving the house. I make the payments. If anyone moves out it will be you." 

 "Maybe if you can find a good enough lawyer you can get me out and you back in, but until then read the paperwork. Pending hearings I've been granted the sole use of the residence. And notice the interim separate maintenance. Miss one check and I'll have your ass for contempt of court. Now get out of my face before I call the cops and file a complaint against you for spousal abuse." 

 "That's bullshit and you know it. No one is going to believe it." 

 "Want to bet that I can't give myself several bruises between the time I call 911 and the cops get here? It will be your word against mine and I'll be the one marked up. Save yourself some grief and get your ass out of this room and over to the spare bedroom and YOU WILL be out of here tomorrow. If you are still here tomorrow you had better plan on staying awake 24/7 because if I catch you asleep I WILL cut your cock off and feed it down the garbage disposal. In fact, I'm not all that sure that I won't do it tonight. Now get the fuck out of my bedroom and stay the hell out of my sight." 

 Jake stared at her for several moments and then he turned and left the room slamming the door behind him. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was watching when Jake left the house in the morning and she called the locksmith she had already made arrangements with. Then she called Dan's office and left a message on his voice mail that she would be a little late getting to work. By nine the locks had all been changed and she headed in to work. 

 She stopped by Marci's desk on the way to her office and asked Marci to tell Dan that she needed to talk with him as soon as he could see her. 

 "I pulled the plug on Jake last night. I served him with divorce papers." 

 "I thought the plan was to stick it to him for years and years." 

 "It was, but he got a promotion and it is in Atlanta and I am so not moving there." 

 "I guess now you are free to party." 

 "Just the opposite. I can't give Jake any ammunition to use against me so I'm going to have to behave. No going out and giving some private eye a chance to follow me and catch me being bad." 

 "Oh you poor girl. With your sexual appetite how are you going to survive?" 

 "That's what I need to talk with Dan about." 

 At 10:05 the attorney called and told her that the process server had served Jake as he was going into the building where he worked. At 10:15 Marci called and said Dan could see her. She entered Dan's office and said: 

 "It is done. He's been served and it will change some things for me. You will have to take me off your list of girls. I know Jake and I can predict what he will try and do. He will hire a private detective to follow me and try to catch me doing something that he can use to counter-sue. I'm still going to want some sort of sex life so if you have some one who is staying here in the hotel during the day I'll take it otherwise I'm off the market." 

 "I can use you some during the day, but it won't pay you near as much as you get working evenings or going out of the hotel on dates." 

 "I know, but I've got the asshole right where I want him and I'm not going to give him anything to ease the pain. Besides, it was never about the money. What got me into it was being able to hang horns on him - put check marks in my book. The money was just a side benefit. Like you told me in the beginning - a slush fund for when and if I ever dumped Jake." 

 "If?" 

 "I would have kept hanging horns on him for thirty years if things had remained the same, but his promotion and having to move to Atlanta to take it changed everything. I wasn't about to follow him to Atlanta." 

 "I don't know of anything coming up during the day this week, but you will get first crack at it if something comes up." 

 "I'm counting on it." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The divorce took eight months to become final mostly, she figured, because Jake was dragging his feet to give him time to come up with something that he could use to counter her filing of infidelity. 

 There would have been a ton of stuff he could have used if he could have gotten his private detective into the hotel to spy on her during the day. A week didn't go by that she didn't take care of at least one friend of Dan's or Dan himself and Harvey was a frequent visitor to the hotel. 

 Finally, probably because legal fees and whatever it was costing him to have her watched were eating him up he stopped dragging his feet and things were finalized. She was awarded half of the assets (money from savings, checking, certificates of deposit and half of the equity resulting from the sale of the house) a share of his pension and 401k and separate maintenance. She had her attorney make Jake's attorney an offer. She would give up the separate maintenance in exchange for Jake's half of the equity in the house. Jake's attorney responded and said the offer was unacceptable since alimony would stop as soon as she remarried which she could do the day after the divorce was final. In effect his client could end up giving up seventy thousand dollars in exchange for one separate maintenance check. 

 There was some negotiation and the end result was that she relinquished her claim on his pension and 401k in exchange for his half of the house, but she kept the separate maintenance. Jake didn't know it, but he would be paying her alimony for the rest of her life as she had no intention of ever getting married again. If she found some one she liked well enough she would live with him, but marriage was out of the question. 

 The day after the divorce was final she and Jake along with their attorneys, a woman from a title company and a man from the mortgage company met for the transfer of the ownership of the house into her name. Once all the papers were signed she asked for a private moment with Jake. When the room was cleared she opened her purse and took out her little black book and handed it to Jake. 

 "I want you to have this. It is a little something to remember me by." 

 Jake opened the book, leafed through the pages and then looked at her in confusion. "It is nothing but a bunch of pages with check marks on them?" 

 "But each one of those check marks has significance. Each mark represents a guy that I fucked after catching you with that slut at the beach. Remember how I always wanted you to eat my pussy before we had sex? Every time you licked my pussy one of those check marks had been in it just hours before your tongue got there. All of those check marks made you a cock sucker by proxy."  

 

 ****** The Wedding Planner Ch. 15 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "You fucking bitch!" 

 "I know, but you are the one who made me that way. And as for being a bitch? How does this grab you. Ten minutes ago a special messenger handed a package to Miss Abigail Hodges. It contained a copy of everything that I have on your cheating ass. The reports, the video tapes, the audio tapes---all of it! Along with it there was a note that said: 

 "You may still want him, but at least you can't say you weren't warned. He cheated on me our entire marriage with multiple women. Just remember...once a cheater, always a cheater." 

 "Have a nice life Jake" and she walked out of the room with a huge smile on her face. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The night her divorce was final she, Pam and Marci went out to celebrate and the three of them ended up in an apartment with five guys. Marci had to leave at ten, but she and Pam took care of the five until noon the next day. 

 The next night she went out alone only intending to have a drink or two before going home and she ended up taking three guys home with her and three nights later she stopped for one drink again and ended up in an apartment with two more. She did another poker party for Dan and while on the bed with a cock in her mouth and a cock pushing deep into her pussy she finally admitted to herself that she really was a slut after all. 

 The next day she called Harvey and asked if his offer was still open. 

 "Of course it is. Who will I be getting the woman who said she wanted to get married again and settle down or the slut that I'm crazy about?" 

 "The slut Harvey; you get the slut." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 EPILOG 

 Harvey did indeed get the slut he wanted. She did whatever he wanted her to do and he wanted her to do a lot. He did set her up in a three bedroom condo and then handed her the deed to it. She sold her house and banked the money with the rest of her "earnings" against the day when Harvey might get tired of her. She didn't think it would happen - he was hinting at marriage - but she had learned that a girl needed to think ahead. 

 She never did tell Marci what Pam had told her about Bobby being in love with Marci. Bobby took care of that himself. He called Marci two and sometimes three times a week. Sometimes he brought Tony with him when he saw her and once or twice he had his dad with him. Eventually he told her how he felt about her and she immediately left her husband and sued for divorce. She asked for sixty percent of the assets and when her husband told her to go to hell she told him if he didn't settle and do it quick she would change her filing from "irreconcilable differences" to "infidelity" and then she dropped the private detectives report on him that she had obtained using some of the money she had made helping out Dan with his friends. His choice was simple - a sixty-forty split OR whatever the court ordered and a successful "infidelity" suit in a state that did not have "No Fault" could amount to a seventy-thirty split, alimony and a share of his pension and 401k when he retired. Frank wisely did not fight the divorce. 

 Bobby was going to set Marci up in an apartment and when Pam found out about it she put her foot down and said "no way." After a sit down between Pam, Bobby and Marci, Marci moved in with Pam and Bobby. So far it seems to be working out. Tony is a frequent visitor and seems to sleep over a lot. She and Harvey spend a lot of time there also. 

 Dan was upset at losing two of his best girls, but the women he hired to replace them turned out to be just as good when it came to "helping out" his friends and she and Marci did come back and visit Dan on occasion. 

 Jake moved to Atlanta and married Abigail Hodges. She had read the reports that had been sent to her and had decided that Jake had strayed because his wife was a cold fish in bed and she had tossed the report into the trash. Six months after her wedding to Jake she found that she had 'some how' gotten a social disease. Her divorce from Jake is pending. Report_Story
