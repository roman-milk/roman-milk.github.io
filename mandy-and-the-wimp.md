 ****** Mandy and the Wimp ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I wasn't ready for it. I knew what I was going to find when I got there, but I still wasn't ready for it and it didn't help any to know that it happened because of something I'd done. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I met Mandy when she came to work at the XYZ Corporation as a secretary. I had started at XYZ the week after my graduation from Eastern Michigan University and in seven years I had risen to regional manager. Sarah, my secretary was going on maternity leave and personnel had sent Mandy to me as her replacement. 

 

 To say I was smitten would be an understatement. I took one look at her and my heart started racing. For me it was a case of love at first sight and that was a bad thing. It was bad because Mandy worked for me. XYZ had been the target of several sexual harassment suits and the corporation had put several policies in place to insure that it never happened again and one of those policies was a strictly enforced "no fraternization" rule. If Mandy worked in a different department or division or different building it would be okay, but working for me or working in my department made her strictly off limits to me. 

 All I could do was look at her day after day and eat my heart out. Several times I caught her looking at me with an expression that I couldn't decipher. I wanted it to mean, "Talk to me, please ask me out" but of course I didn't dare because I had already seen how ruthless XYZ could be when their policies were ignored. In the space of six months I'd seen three managers let go because of what I considered minor, extremely minor, infractions. All I could do, unless I was willing to give up my career, was look longingly at Mandy and eat my heart out. 

 One day in the lunchroom Stella, our office manager, sat down at my table and asked me what I was going to do about Mandy. 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "The poor girl can't keep her eyes off of you and everybody sees how you look at her. Something has to give here." 

 "You know the policy, same as I do." 

 "You two belong together Rob, are you going to let your job get in the way?" 

 "You bet I am Stella. I can see it clear as day. I ask her out, she says yes, we go on a date and find out that outside of a physical attraction to each other we have nothing in common - nothing else going for us. We thank each other for a nice time, neither of us planning on seeing the other socially ever again and the next day I come to work and get fired for dating my secretary in violation of corporate policy. That is a chance I'm not willing to take. She might be worth it Stella, but she might not." 

 I suppose I could have asked Stella to move Mandy someplace else in the office so I wouldn't have to look at her every day, but since she hadn't been with me long it would look bad on her record. Stella would know the reason and she wouldn't put anything bad in Mandy's file, but no one else in the corporation would know that. All they would know was that she came to work for me and I had her moved out in a very short while and therefore there would always be questions about her ability and efficiency. 

 Things limped along for another four months and then a miracle happened. When Sarah went on maternity leave she told me that the odds on her coming back were long, that she was strongly considering being a stay at home mom. Then her husband got laid off and she felt she had to come back. Stella was going to assign her to Bill Brodman, but I saw a chance and I took it. 

 "Give her back to me Stel. That will give you a legitimate reason to move Mandy. Get her out of this department and into another division. If you do it that way it won't look like I got rid of her because she wasn't a good secretary." 

 Stella did it and Mandy was transferred. That happened on a Thursday and I began to plan my next move. I'd give Mandy a couple of days to settle in at her new job and then I'd ask her out. I wasted time in making my plan. When I left work that night I found Mandy leaning on the front fender of my car. We were married four months later. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Fast forward five years. Mandy is a stay at home mom with Todd Allen (4) and Nancy Elise (2) and I have risen to divisional manager with a good shot at becoming the next vice president of Engineering. Mandy and I are still as much in heat and love with each other as ever and our marriage is still going gangbusters. I have a great career and a marvelous home life. Life is good. The only bad spot in things is the fact that as a divisional manager I have to travel and at least twice a month I'm gone for two or three days visiting units in my division. I have to do it, but I hate it. As far as I'm concerned time away from my family is wasted time, but it is a necessary evil and I have to do it and do it well if I hope to make VP. If I make VP it is the people under me who will have to do the traveling. 

 Mandy had a sister who lived in New York and I'd never met her, but Mandy talked with her on the phone several times a week. One day I came home from work and Mandy greeted me at the door naked except for high heels. 

 "The kids are next door with Sally (the girl who did our babysitting) and I have a great desire to have dessert before we have dinner. Think you can remember the way to the bedroom or has my naked body clouded your mind?" 

 I dropped my briefcase and took her right there on the floor. When it was over she gave me a passionate kiss and said: 

 "I should do this more often." 

 "The fact that you don't prompts me to ask what is the special occasion?" 

 "God, I can't slip anything by you can I? I want to ask you a big favor." 

 "Go ahead, ask it." 

 "Tanya (her sister) is moving here. She got a promotion and they gave her the office here. Can she stay in the spare bedroom until she can find a place of her own?" 

 "Of course she can. She's family. You don't have to bribe me to get me to agree to that." 

 "That's only part of it." 

 "What's the rest?" 

 "I want to take her out and show her around, but she won't know a soul here except for us. Somewhere along the line I'm going to want you to find her a nice guy to date." 

 "You want me to set your sister up with a blind date?" 

 "Yes baby, that's what I want." 

 "I won't promise you anything. I won't set her up with anyone I know until after I've met her and satisfied myself that she isn't cross-eyed and has buck teeth." 

 "You are awful. Can we do it again? On the bed this time?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Tanya was almost as gorgeous as Mandy and I remembered the favor Mandy wanted and realized that it wouldn't be a chore after all and in fact, I'd probably make points with whoever I set her up with. She had a great personality, a wicked sense of humor and was extremely intelligent. 

 Having another woman in the house to some getting used to. For one thing I had to learn to close doors when I was in the bathroom and I had to stop running around the house half naked. 

 The first two weeks Tanya was with us she spent settling into her new job and taking over from the previous manager who was retiring. I was packing my suitcase for a three day trip when Mandy reminded me that I said I would find someone to set Tanya up with. 

 "I want to go out when you get back so think on it, okay?" 

 "I'll give it my best shot." 

 "Honestly babe, someone nice. I just want....oh shit! Never mind. She's a big girl now. She should be able to handle what comes along." 

 That night after I'd checked into the hotel I called home and Sally answered. When I asked where Mandy was Sally told me that Mandy and Tanya had gone out and said they might be late. I told Sally to have Mandy call if she got home by ten and that if not I'd talk to her the next day. I called the next morning when I woke up and found out that the two girls had gone out for dinner and drinks to celebrate Tanya's first day of being in sole charge of her new office. 

 "We had a fun time being together and I'll probably want to do it again; you know, a girls night out kind of thing. It will let me get to know a sister that I was never really close to." 

 "It will give you something to do when I'm on my trips. Got to run honey, I'll call you tonight." 

 That night when I called Mandy asked me if I had given any thought to whom I might try to line Tanya up with and I told her that I had a couple in mind, but that I hadn't sounded anyone out on the idea of a blind date yet. I told her I'd get on it as soon as I got back from the trip. 

 Two days later when I was back at the office I approached Jake and explained the situation to him, how Mandy wanted to take Tanya out and show her around, but didn't want Tanya to feel like she was a third leg so we needed an escort for her. Jake said he couldn't help. He'd just gotten into a relationship that might go somewhere and he didn't want to jeopardize it. Next I approached Norm, explained the situation and he said he would give it a try, but only after threatening me with bodily harm if he found out that I'd set him up with a dog. I told him I would set things up for Friday and then I went home to give Mandy the news. 

 "Who is it?" 

 "Norm Stafford." 

 "Do I know him?" 

 "No. He came to work for us after you left." 

 "He's not going to hurt Tanya, is he?" 

 "Who knows sweetie, they might hit it off and they might not. Whatever, if it goes somewhere and then ends badly it won't be our fault." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Friday I had Norm follow me home, introduced him to Tanya and Mandy and then we headed out. We had a nice dinner and then we started hitting the nightspots. We did several lounges and clubs, did quite a bit of dancing and a good time was had by all. 

 As we got ready for bed that night I commented to Mandy that Tanya and Norm seemed to hit it off okay. 

 "They did," she said. "He asked her out for tomorrow and she said yes. So come on over here and get your reward for doing such a good job and she laid down on the bed wearing her high heels. She knew my buttons all right. The only thing that turned me on more than seeing her naked was seeing her naked except for high heels. She spread her legs wide in an open invitation and smiled as she crooked a finger at me and said: 

 "Come on baby, Mandy is waiting." 

 I lowered my face to her pussy and saw that the lips were already wet with anticipation and then I heard the long, low moan as my tongue parted those lips. Mandy and I rolled around on the bed for over an hour. After I worshipped her pussy for a while she coaxed me into a sixty-nine and when she was ready she mounted me. We made love fast and hard the way she liked it and then she sucked me hard again and we made love slow and leisurely the way I liked it. And then we went into another sixty-nine and made love again. It was a very satisfying night. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Once Tanya had her office running like she wanted it she started looking for an apartment, found one and then moved out of our spare bedroom. Six months went by and though I usually only saw her about once every two weeks Mandy told me that she was getting along fine. Mandy still had her 'girls night out' with Tanya when I was out of town on business and not being a busybody I never bothered Norm by asking him how he and Tanya were getting along. 

 The first indication that all was not right in my world came the day I called Sally and asked her to baby-sit for us and she said she couldn't sit for us anymore. I asked why and she told me that her mom wouldn't let her sit for us. 

 "She won't let you baby sit or she just won't let you sit for us?" 

 "I can't sit for you Mr. Maples." 

 I found another sitter and then the next day I paid Sally's mother a call to see if I could find out what the problem was. All I could get from her was that she didn't want her daughter exposed to what was going on. I kept trying to get more out of her about what was 'going on' but she said it wasn't her place to be talking about things like that. 

 The following day I was parked outside the high school when Sally's classes ended and when she came out of the building I walked up to her and told her I needed to talk with her. At first she wouldn't say anything, but I kept poking and prying and finally she told me why her mother wouldn't let her sit for us anymore. 

 "Mrs. Maples sometimes comes home with a man and he is still there when I leave and I've seen his car still there when I go to school in the morning." 

 "And you told your mother and now she doesn't want you exposed to things like that, is that it?" 

 "Yes sir." 

 "Thanks for talking to me Sally." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was in no mood to go home just then so I went back to the office and worked on clearing up some paperwork while I thought about what I'd just found out. I loved Mandy, had from the first moment I'd laid eyes on her, but being in love doesn't mean you have to be stupid. I wasn't about to go into denial and try to tell myself that there could be a perfectly good and logical reason for Mandy brining a man home and for his car to still be there in the morning. There was only one reason for something like that and I knew damned well what it was. 

 But thinking you know and knowing for sure are two different breed of cat. If it was an overnight thing then it could only take place when I was on trips. Mandy's birthday was coming up in a month and I decided to try and use that fact to dig a little. I was going to have to take a gamble. Mandy said she wanted her girl's nights out with Tanya so she could get to know a sister she had never been close to a little better. I was going to gamble that she still didn't know Tanya well enough to let her in on what she was doing behind my back. If Tanya knew, or worse, was a part of whatever Mandy was doing, it shouldn't hurt because I wasn't going to make accusations. The worst it would do would be to make her wonder if I was maybe getting suspicious. If she put two and two together then it would be out in the open quicker than I wanted it to be, but oh well. 

 I called Tanya and asked her to meet me for lunch the next day and not let Mandy know. She asked why Mandy couldn't know and I told her that Mandy's birthday was coming up and I was working on a surprise party. Tanya met me at Mario's and as soon as we had ordered and the waitress had gone I asked: 

 "When you and Mandy go out on your girls nights out what is Mandy's favorite place?" 

 "What girls night out Rob? Mandy and I haven't gone out since I moved into my new apartment." 

 Well, I had wanted information and it sure hadn't taken me long to start getting it, but I needed to cover myself so I said: 

 "Yeah, I know, but where did she usually want to go?" 

 "I guess we went to the Pink Lady more than any other place. Why?" 

 "I'm thinking of throwing her a surprise party. You know, get everyone to the bar and then take her out to dinner and then stop at the bar after and surprise her." 

 "Should work," she said and then we made general conversation for a while. I asked how she was getting along with Norm and she told me that she wasn't seeing him anymore. "He was a nice enough guy, but I always felt like he wasn't really interested in me. I got the feeling that he had someone else he was interested in and I was just a fill in." 

 "Got anyone else on the line?" 

 "I'm dating a guy I work with, but I don't think it is going anywhere." 

 "I don't understand it sweetie; just based on looks alone guys should be falling all over themselves to get to you. I'll bet they flocked to the table to ask you to dance on your nights out with Mandy." 

 "Oh they flocked all right, but the draw was Mandy, not me." 

 "You're kidding?" 

 "Well, I guess that isn't really the way it was. What it was was that Mandy danced more than I did because I was more selective than she was. If I didn't like the looks of them I said no thanks when asked, but Mandy loves to dance and she never said no to anyone. Some of the ones she danced with were so aggressive that I'm surprised I was able to get her out of the place and home in one piece. So how are you going to handle the birthday?" 

 "Not sure yet. I want to do it on her birthday and it is on a Wednesday. I'll need to see how many people want to come out on a weekday night for a party." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I left the restaurant knowing that Mandy had been lying to me for almost six months. Every time I went on a trip she told me that she went out with Tanya, but Tanya just finished telling me that she hadn't gone out with Mandy since she moved out of our spare bedroom. I also knew something else, something that Tanya hadn't realized she was telling me. From her description of their nights out it sounded like Mandy would have been decorating backseats in the parking lot if Tanya hadn't been there to act as her keeper. 

 Is that what had been going on? After Tanya moved out had Mandy kept going to the Pink Lady and meeting guys? I would have to find out and there was only one way I could do that. Apparently Mandy only did it when I was out of town on business so I was going to have to fake a trip and then follow her. 

 My next trip was not for another two weeks and I spent those weeks closely watching Mandy. I didn't see anything different in her attitude towards me. She seemed as loving and affectionate as always. As the date of my trip approached I didn't see any indication that she was in a hurry to see me leave, no sign of anticipating getting together with her lover (or lovers). I made the necessary calls to reschedule my meetings and I of course did not tell Mandy of the changes. 

 The day of the supposed trip she kissed me goodbye and casually reminded me that she might not be home if I called before eleven. 

 "Tanya and I are going out for dinner and drinks." 

 "Well have a nice time sweetie. Say hi to Tanya for me. Tell her not to be such a stranger. She needs to stop by and visit once in a while." 

 I drove to the airport, parked in the short-term lot and then hit National car rental and rented a small compact. Next stop was a motel where I took a room for the night. I went over to the recreation center and worked out for a couple of hours and then caught an afternoon matinee after which I drove back to my neighborhood where I found a place to park where I could watch the house and then I settled in to wait. 

 It was six in the evening when Mandy came out of the house with a bag and did something in the backseat and then she went back in the house and came out with the two kids and loaded them into the car. I noticed that she was wearing a short skirt and high heels. I followed her to a house where she got the kids out of the car, took them into the house, and a short time later she came out alone, got in her car and drove off. Mandy had obviously found a replacement babysitter for Sally. 

 I followed along behind her and was not surprised when she pulled into the parking lot at the Pink Lady. She parked and went inside and I found a place where I could park and watch her car. I couldn't go inside and risk being seen so I had to settle for sitting outside and waiting to see what would happen. It was ten to seven and Mandy had told me that she wouldn't be home before eleven so I had four hours to sit. 

 It didn't take four hours. At nine-thirty she came out of the bar with some guy and got in her car. They necked in the front seat for a bit and then I saw her head go down and I knew the guy was getting a hum job. Maybe three minutes later her head came up and I saw her wipe her mouth with the back of her hand and then the two of them got in the back and a minute or so later I saw her legs come up and her feet start kicking in the air. The two of them fucked for about six or seven minutes and while they were getting it on several people came out of the bar, walked past the car and stopped to watch for a bit before moving on. One guy knocked on the window and asked the guy inside if he was going to share. I didn't hear the reply, but it must have been no because the guy moved on. Finally the guy must have gotten off because he and Mandy sat up and talked for several minutes and then her head went down again and three or four minutes later they fucked again.  

 

 ****** Mandy and the Wimp ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I was surprised at my lack of anger and at my ability to just sit there and watch. I guess that after my talks with Sally and Tanya I had already accepted that the marriage and my relationship with Mandy were dead and by the time I got my proof I just didn't care enough to be outraged by it. 

 After a while they both sat up in the back seat and talked for several minutes and then the guy got out of the car and went back into the bar. Mandy got out of the back and I saw her take a bag from the front and put something from the back in it and then she started up and drove off. I followed her as she drove over and picked up the kids and then followed her home. 

 There was a car sitting in the drive when she got home and there was somebody sitting in it. Mandy unloaded the kids and took them in the house and whoever was in the strange car just sat there. About fifteen minutes later - long enough to put the kids to bed - Mandy came back to the front door and turned the porch light on and waited. A man got out of the parked car and moved toward the front porch and as he entered the light and I got a good look at him I remembered back to what Tanya had said about Norm -"He had someone else"- and now I knew who that someone else was. 

 Norm went in the front door and it closed and then the porch light went out. I waited several minutes and then I got out of my car and went over to Mandy's. I had some curiosity about the bag I'd seen her bring out of the house and then put something in when she and the guy at the bar finished what they were doing. When I picked up the bag and looked inside I saw a beach towel. Mandy had used it to keep cum stains off of the back seat. I dropped the bag back in the car and quietly closed the door. 

 I went around to the back of the house and very, very quietly let myself in the back door and eased the door closed behind me. I heard voices coming from the living room and I moved over to where I could peer around the doorframe. Norm was sitting on the couch, still fully dressed, but with his cock exposed and in his hand. Mandy was doing a slow strip in front of him and as she took off her clothes she seemed to be describing to him what she had done that night. 

 "... a nice cock and he loved the way I sucked on him. How about it lover, can you imagine it? Can you see my head bobbing up and down on his cock?" 

 Norman just sat there, stared at her and stroked his cock. 

 "He fucked me twice lover and I'm full of him. I've got lots of him inside me lover and I really don't like it there. Are you ready lover, are you ready to pray at my altar?" 

 Norm moaned, "Oh yes, please" and he hurriedly got off the couch and I noticed that Mandy had also covered the couch with a beach towel. As Norm stood up Mandy moved by him, sat down on the couch and spread her legs wide and giggled as she said: 

 "Come on lover, show Mandy how bad you want her." Norm was stripping as Mandy continued, "Come on lover, hurry it up. Get over here and show me how bad you want me." 

 Norm still had his socks on as he went to his knees in front of Mandy and buried his face in her crotch. "That's it lover, that's it. Suck him out of me. Get all of him out." 

 I watched amazed as I saw a Mandy that I never knew existed. The woman I'd been watching since she left the house to drop off the kids was and absolute whore. 

 "Come on lover, dig that tongue in and get all of him out of me. Or maybe you don't want to. Maybe what you want is to soak your cock in his leavings. Is that it lover? You want some really sloppy seconds?" 

 "You bitch. You fucking bitch" Norm whined. "I bet you don't treat Rob this way." 

 Mandy laughed, "OF course I don't. My husband is a man. You are a worm. No real man would put up with this. Rob would throw me out on the street if I even asked him to do something like this. Now lick me clean lover or soak your pathetic little cock in a man's cum or get your worthless ass out of Rob's house. You decide." 

 Norm stood up and then sat down next to Mandy and then she stood up and lowered herself down on Norm's cock as she laughed and said: 

 "God lover, you are just so pussy whipped." 

 "This would be better in bed Mandy. Are you ever going to let me have you on your bed?" 

 "Of course not lover, that's Rob's bed - a man's bed - and I can't foul it with a worm like you." 

 I looked at my watch and saw that it was ten after eleven. I had noticed that Mandy's purse was on the end table next to the couch and that it was within easy reach. I smiled to myself as I took my cell phone off my belt and then stepped back from the doorway. I quietly moved several paces backwards so she wouldn't hear that I was right behind her and I hit the preset for her cell phone. It rang and I saw her reach for her purse and take out the phone. She saw from the display that the call was from me so she covered Norm's mouth with one hand and kept riding his cock as she hit the button to take my call. 

 "Hi sweetie, I wondered if you would call." 

 "How was your night with Tanya?" 

 "It was okay. We had dinner and a few drinks and I was home early. Got home about nine. Tanya said to say hi." 

 She was moving up and down on Norm's dick, still with one hand over his mouth as she said: 

 "Damn sweetie, I do wish you were here right now." 

 "Why?" 

 "What do you mean sweetie, you I miss you." 

 "Really? Is that why you fuck Norm when I'm gone, because you miss me so much?" 

 She stopped riding Norm's cock and said, "That's not funny Rob." 

 "Might not be funny Mandy, but it is the truth." 

 I took several steps forward so I was standing in the doorway when she said: 

 "Just what are you accusing me of Rob?" 

 "Look over your shoulder Mandy." 

 Her head whipped around and I took her picture with the camera feature on my phone. I got a couple more as she scrambled to get off Norm and then I put the phone away. Exerting all the control I was able to muster to suppress my anger I told Norm to get his clothes and leave while he was still able. 

 "I don't want to go to jail over a worthless piece of shit like you, but I'm only going to be able to hold back the anger for so long and you had best be gone before I lose control." 

 He hurried off the couch, put on his pants and then gathered up the rest of his clothes and ran for the door. I turned to Mandy. "Get dressed and get out!" 

 "No Rob, this isn't what you think it is. We need to talk." 

 "You heard what I told that asshole. I'm barely in control of myself right now and I want you out of here before I come unglued." 

 "I'm not leaving Rob. I'm not afraid that you will hurt me. I know you better than that. You love me and you won't lay a finger on me. I love you too Rob and you need to let me explain what you walked in on." 

 "Will that explanation include what you did in the parking lot of the Pink Lady?" 

 "That's part of it so yes, it will be included." 

 "Sorry Mandy, but I don't have the faith in me that you have." 

 I had already packed for my trip and had clothes in my motel room so I turned and headed for the front door. 

 "Where are you going? We need to talk Rob." 

 "I'm going away from you Mandy," I said as I walked out the front door. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next morning I caught my flight for Atlanta and spent the next three days taking care of business and the nights staring at the ceiling unable to sleep. My first day in Atlanta I called Harry (my boss) to give him a progress report and then I told him about Norm and Mandy. 

 "I'm telling you this so you will be prepared for the problems when I get back to the office." 

 "What kind of problems?" 

 "I'll probably go for his throat first time I see him." 

 "That would not be a good thing," he said and then he changed the subject. 

 Mandy called me on my cell a dozen times each day I was in Atlanta, but I didn't take any of the calls. I flew home on Friday and when I went into the office I sensed that all eyes were on me as I headed for Harry's office to turn in my report. I also handed him my letter of resignation. 

 "What's this?" 

 "I'm resigning. I obviously can't work here now. I'd be after Norm every time I laid my eyes on him." 

 Harry tore up the letter and tossed it in the trash can next to his desk as he said: 

 "Norm doesn't work here any more. I fired him five minutes after talking to you on the phone. You going to need some time off to take care of other personal problems?" 

 "No, I don't think so." 

 "Okay. Take off and I'll see you Monday morning." 

 I left the office and checked into a motel and started looking in the Yellow Pages for a divorce attorney. I was in luck. The first one I called was still in his office and he said he could see me Monday and I made an appointment for after I got off work. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I spent the weekend playing golf, going to the movies and not taking Mandy's phone calls. Monday I buried myself in work and ignored my cell since I knew that every time it went off it was Mandy. At quitting time I was almost out the front door when I spotted Mandy leaning on the front fender of my car. I turned before she saw me and went out the back door and down the street until I found a working pay phone and called a cab. 

 "Are you sure, absolutely sure, that you want to do this?" the attorney asked. "No way you can heal the breach?" 

 "None that I can see." 

 "If you go through with this you are going to get hosed pretty bad. This is a no fault state and that means a fifty/fifty split of assets plus you will be paying child support, probably alimony and almost certainly all of the legal costs and by that I mean her attorneys fees, my fees and all court costs. You could go for custody of the children claiming she is an unfit mother since she did what she did while they were in the house and she wasn't behind the closed doors of her bedroom. In all honesty that rarely happens unless the wife is a stoned out drug addict and even then it is iffy. 

 "What happens if I do nothing? Just move out and send her money each week for the kids." 

 "That would depend on her. She could accept it for a while or forever or she could get a lawyer and start divorce proceedings of her own. If she did that the outcome would be almost the same except she might have to pay for her own attorney. Still want to do it?" 

 "I think I need to think on it a little more." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I took a cab back to work and had it drive by slowly by the parking lot so I could see if Mandy was still there and when I didn't see her I had him drop me off. I had just started the car when I heard: 

 "I hoped I wouldn't have to spend the night here sleeping on the back seat" and I turned to see Mandy sitting up. 

 "What have you got against back seats. From what I saw last Monday night you do some of your best work on a back seat. Get out of the car Mandy." 

 "No Rob. We have to talk. You have to let me explain." 

 "What the hell is there to explain Mandy? You are fucking other men and you have been so blatant about it that Mrs. Ebbert won't let Sally sit for us any more." 

 "Oh Jesus, is that what happened?" 

 "You figure it out Mandy. You came home with a man and his car is still sitting there the next morning. What do you think her mom is going to do, come over and ask you if you had a good time?" 

 "I'm sorry, I guess I didn't think it through. I should have had him come over after Sally went home." 

 "Listen to yourself. "I should have ....," Shit! Get out of the car Mandy, just go!" 

 "No Rob, not until you hear me out." 

 There was nothing for it. She was obviously going to haunt me until she could do what she wanted. I could get out of the car and leave, but she would just arrange to catch me again so I decided to get it over with. 

 "All right Mandy. Go ahead and speak your piece and then get out." 

 "I had hoped that you would listen with an open mind Rob, I'm trying to save my marriage here." 

 "Then you are wasting your time and mine. I watched you fuck two different men last Monday night and that ended the marriage as far as I'm concerned. No way we stay together after that." 

 "Doesn't it even matter that I love you?" 

 "Some love. Two men that night and God only knows how many before then." 

 "Believe it or not Rob, I do love you and I don't want to lose you. What you saw tonight was me getting something I can't get from you." 

 "So, after five years you finally decide to tell me I'm no good in bed?" 

 "No Rob, that isn't it at all. I found out something about myself that I wasn't aware of before. I discovered I have a need to dominate, to bully a man, and it couldn't be you. For one thing, if you had allowed it even though I love you I would have lost all respect for you. I knew that so I didn't even try." 

 In spite of myself I was interested in where she was going with it so I sat there and waited for her to go on. 

 "It started one night when Tanya, Norm and I were out. It was just after Tanya moved into her apartment. Norm was driving and he dropped Tanya off first. I thought it a little strange that he would do that since he was after all supposed to be her date, but I didn't think too hard on it. You were on one of your trips and when we got to the house Norm asked if he could come in and I told him no. Then he grabbed me and kissed me. I was so stunned I just sat there and stared at him and he kissed me a second time and then I slapped him as hard as I could. He moaned and crowded across the seat at me and pinned me against the door and kissed me a third time and that time I hit him in the head as hard as I could with my purse and he moaned, "Yes, yes, oh God yes." I reached for the door handle and he grabbed me and said: 

 "Don't go, you can't go, look at what you have done to me." 

 "I glanced over and saw that he had taken his cock out and it was as stiff as a board. He grabbed and pulled me toward him and I hit him again and he moaned, "Oh God, hurt me, please hurt me." 

 "I was pretty pissed off by then and I thought, "Hurt? You want hurt? I'll show you hurt" and I grabbed his cock and dug my nails into it and then scooted around so I could get my other hand on his nuts and I squeezed them as hard as I could and he screamed out, "Oh yes, oh yes yes yes." 

 "I don't know why, because it had never happened to me before, but I was getting turned on by inflicting pain on Norm and I wondered how far I could go. I wasn't even thinking about what I was doing when I lowered my head and took his cock in my mouth. I took him in as far as I could and then I bit him - hard - and he came. It caught me by surprise and I jerked my mouth off him and his last couple of spurts went on my face. I called him a shit-headed pig and told him to get his fucking cum off me and he took my head in his hands and started licking his stuff off my face. 

 I sat there amazed, both at what I had done and at what he had allowed me to do, and at the same time I was wondering what else I could do to him. I called him a fucking worm and told him to follow me into the house. That was the start of it. The more I mistreated him, the more he wanted to be mistreated and humiliated and the more I did both the more turned on I was. When I was so turned on I was ready to climb walls I let him fuck me. I was so excited that it never took him more than a minute to get me off and then I would pull off his cock and leave him hanging. 

 "I treated him like dog shit and he loved it. The problem was that I loved it too and the only one I could do it with was Norm. Honest to God Rob, I love you and I don't want to spend my life with anyone but you. What I did with Norm wasn't love or even like, it was just sick sex. I was just getting something from Norm that I could never get from you." 

 "What about the man you fucked in the parking lot?" 

 "He meant nothing to me Rob, I just used him as another way to humiliate Norm." 

 "You'll have to explain that one." 

 "I did it so I could make Norm suck another man's cum out of me." 

 "You do that often?" 

 "That night was only the second time." 

 "Would there have been a third?" 

 "I don't know. I was always looking for nasty things to do to Norm and if I'd had come up with some new way probably not." 

 "But if you found nothing new to use it probably would have happened again right?" 

 She looked away from me. "So what has changed Mandy?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "If it is something you need why aren't you with Norm right now tormenting him. You could be abusing him full time instead of only occasionally." 

 "I don't want to be with him Rob, I want to be with you." 

 "That is something you should have thought about before you started up with Norm. You are used goods now Mandy. By your own admission you have been used by Norm and two other men and more would have been in your future if I hadn't caught you. No Mandy, we are toast! You've had your say, now please leave and don't bother me any more." 

 "Doesn't the fact that I love you mean anything to you?" 

 "Not any more Mandy, not any more." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I decided on the do nothing strategy. The house was mine before I married Mandy and mine was the only name on the title so I sold it. I gave Mandy enough to move into an apartment and suggested that she get a job since all I was going to give her was enough to take care of the kids. I pick them up every Friday evening and keep them until Sunday afternoon. They are too young to understand what is going on and I'm dreading the day they start asking. 

 So far Mandy hasn't seen a lawyer, but I expect that she eventually will. I have no idea if she is still getting together with Norm to abuse him or if she is seeing some one else and I have no interest in knowing. 

 I'm dating even though I know it can't turn out well in the long run. We are a good enough fit, but the external relationships are going to be the problem. Tanya called me one night and said: 

 "I hear that you and Mandy have separated." 

 "That's a fact." 

 "Was it Norm?" 

 "Yes, as a matter of fact it was." 

 "I kind of thought he was interested in her from the way he looked at her, but I never noticed her looking back." 

 "Long sad story there." 

 "I'd like to hear it sometime." 

 "It isn't very pretty." 

 "I don't expect it would be. You do need to know that that kind of behavior doesn't run in the family." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "You're a smart guy, you'll figure it out. Call me" and she hung up. 

 I did figure it out and I did call her, and we started dating. I have no idea how a relationship with the sister of the wife I kicked out is going to go. It will be interesting to see what happens. Report_Story
