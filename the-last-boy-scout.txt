 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 01 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© ====================== 

 He can't resist helping anyone in need. 

 This is a four chapter story. Not a lot of the hot and heavy in the first chapter, but it comes on strong in the next three. All chapters are complete, and will be submitted in the next few days, after final edits. 

 The characters in this story are all at least 18 years old. 

 ====================== 

 Don't get me wrong. I love camping. 

 I like the preparation, selecting my gear, carefully loading the backpack, picking out the area to hike, and planning the whole event. I love the experience, the hours spent trekking through the wilderness, selecting a suitable campsite, the quiet of the outdoors, the majestic vistas, the fresh air. I even enjoy the sense of accomplishment of minimally invasive outdoor living, where after a few days, you'd never know somebody had bivouacked there. 

 This was not camping. 

 The Outdoors Club had selected the campsite. The permissible fire locations evaluated and chosen. Tent locations tagged. There were even tables for eating. 

 

 It's not that I'm not sociable. Au contraire. But camping, to me, had a different connotation than most in this group. In part, that's why I was hauling my gear to the most remote camping space I could find within the 'allowed' area. If I was going to rough it here, I'd do it apart from the others where possible, and do it in style. 

 I say camping space, since where the rest of the school's Outdoors Club were spending the absolute minimum amount of time setting up a tiny pop-up 2-man tent, I was going to create a personal retreat. 

 My family was trekkers, climbers, and outdoorsmen, and like my father and brother before me, I was an Eagle Scout, proudly. Before I was 14 I'd summited my first 20,000 ft. peak. Our outdoor gear tended to the high-end. Either ultra-lightweight, ultra-sturdy gear that could (and had) survived a blizzard at 16,000 ft, or ridiculously luxurious family gear you could drag out of the Land Rover and setup within 50 ft or so, where weight and size weren't an issue. 

 When planning for this trip, I had opted for comfort. The school van was dropping off our gear within a couple of hundred yards of where we planned to spend our extended weekend, miles away from anything resembling civilization. No need to worry about cramming two weeks of sustenance and survival into a 50 lb backpack I'd be hauling for hundreds of miles. A $500 Alpine mummy bag, good to -40°, might be critical on a Denali summit attempt, but an early fall, national park weekend outing screamed out to me for the parent's ultra-spacious North Face 3-season double bag, with self-inflating double-width pad. Sure, at nearly 16 lbs it was four times as heavy as I would normally carry, but then again, I was only carrying it a quarter mile or so. 

 Of course I had ulterior motives. My girlfriend had graduated and moved away over the summer. I was single, for the first time in over a year. If there was any chance of getting lucky on this trip, the double-wide sleeping bag had its advantages. To be honest, I believed the odds were in my favor. I wasn't just available, but actively pursuing opportunities. The Outdoors Club was a target rich environment, restricted to upperclassmen, with two girls for every guy in the club. Literally. With 22 people on this trip, there were only 8 guys total, excluding the chaperons. Like I said, nice odds. 

 As for equipment choices, so important on a mission like this one, comfort and privacy were behind my tent selection. Watching my class-mates erect their "Happy Camper" $25 Sears pup-tents, I was still clearing out the flooring area of rocks and twigs and laying out a 9' x 12' ground tarp when they started taking off for the river. I had selected a location a good 50 feet away and at least 10 feet higher up than the wide flat space where most of them had chosen to setup camp. It was away from the clearing, under cover of the massive trees, and almost like being outdoors. 

 My backpack was pretty loaded, even without the tent, sleeping bag, and ground pad. I had been on enough of these 'Tenderfoot' trips, to know how ill prepared most people were, including our chaperons. I had a pack full of useful stuff, from paracord to poly tarps, wool blankets to windbreakers, coffee to cocoa. Spare knives, lots of first aid supplies, and twice the clothes I'd normally pack for three days. I had it drilled into me enough: "Be Prepared." 

 I broke out the biggest camo tarp, 14' x 20', and ran a rope between two trees a little wider than the cloth. It only took about five minutes to create a spacious rain/sun shelter, and I moved my gear underneath it, along with my two camp chairs. I took a break, looking down at the work going on below. Nearly everyone else was finished, and I hadn't even started on my actual tent yet. 

 Teri had been teasing me, in a good-natured way, after finishing her own setup. "That's a lot of gear you've got," she observed, watching me hammer the heavy- duty stakes into the ground with the back of my hatchet. 

 "I like to be comfortable and dry," I explained, unfolding the tent in the center of the ground preparations. I looked over at where her tent was, the nearest to mine. It was higher than the others were. "Good choice for your spot, it should stay dry if we get any of the predicted rain. I can't believe the area we're supposed to camp is in a depression." 

 "Thirty percent chance of showers on the last day? What are you? A wuss? I wouldn't sweat it too much." 

 "Gotta love those weathermen, always 100% accurate." 

 She was a loud mouth, and a pain in my butt, but a decent friend in spite of all that. "Need some help?" she asked, reaching out to one corner of the folded up material and straightening it. 

 "Thanks, that would help a lot." 

 I had always liked Teri. We'd been the best of friends through middle school, and even up through my freshman year. She was honest and open, speaking her mind, but rarely judgmental. A goody-two-shoes, for the most part, and pure as the driven snow, but unlike some she didn't force her values on you. Lucky for me. 

 She was ready for the water, wearing a bikini top and shorts, with open-toed sandals. It was only a hundred yards or so to the bank, one of the main reasons we'd chosen this spot, but there wasn't much of a trail. I hoped her feet and legs didn't get scraped up too badly on the way back and forth, that would be a true shame. Her chest might not be head-turning, barely filling her bikini but from the waist down, not bad. Those legs, though a little skinny for my tastes, seemed to go on forever. Teri was about 5'9" and most of that was legs. Easily her best feature. 

 "Jeez, Alex, how big is this thing?" she asked, as we continued the unfolding. 

 "Mmm," I purred. "You have no idea how many times I've dreamed of you uttering those very words." 

 She slapped me on the arm, looking around for any witnesses of my verbal haranguing and her physical assault. "Ass," she said, but I could hear the smile in her voice. 

 "It's not that big. It's a six man tent, but it has a pretty large entrance vestibule, bigger than the tent." 

 "Just a six man tent. While I'm stuck in an oversize matchbox with Heather and her 20 lbs of makeup. I've built bigger tents than ours out of cushions in my parent's living room." She was helping me thread the bungeed pole through the series of a dozen or so loops that would hold the dome up. One of six poles the mountaineering base camp tent used to keep it sturdy. It would survive a monsoon. Bending over, I got a nice view of a little boobage. Not a lot, but enough to make me smile. 

 "Hey, I offered to let you share mine," I reminded her. 

 "Right. Never mind the Herculean effort it would take to keep my virtue intact, how many ways could that plan go wrong?" 

 Herculean. I liked that about Teri. Not afraid to exercise her vocabulary. "Wrong?" I countered. 

 "One. Chaperons? Remember? No going in each other's tents? We'd be kicked out of the club, and possibly suspended. At least I would be, somehow you always seem to skate. Two. My impeccable reputation, which is being sullied as we speak from the mere proximity of our resident Don Juan..." 

 "Don Juan?" I interjected, trying to invest my voice with all the injustice and hurt I could, while sliding the longer poles into their slots, where they would hold the roof in place. 

 "Hush, Señor Juan. Three, the absolute certainty my parents would find out about my behavior and upon my shameful return home, I'd see all my belongings scattered by the curb, my face cut out of the family portraits, and a large street sign in the yard announcing eviction from my childhood manse, on the basis of moral turpitude. With Alex, no less, of whose questionable morality I'd been warned of plenty of times, from family, friends, and foes." 

 She stood up, continuing to lecture me on the dangers I presented, while we bowed the center poles, raising the tent roof. 

 "Four, the inevitable shaming and humiliation I'd endure from the myriad young ladies present who really want to be in your tent. The same girls who would banish me from the coveted first floor, east-wing ladies room, ostracizing me and forcing me to change my name to Hester and embroider a large 'A' above my breast." 

 I chuckled sliding the last pole in place and adjusting the tension all around before staking everything securely. "A for Alex?" I teased. "You'd name your breast after me? That's sweet." 

 "You heathen," she growled. "Unlike the hoi-poloi we're doomed to consort with, you know better." 

 "Consorting now? What's that going to do for your impious reputation, Miss Prynne?" 

 She was still helping me, stretching the fly across the top of the tent, elastic cords stretching it in place. I dodged an incoming plastic stake. "Impeccable, not impious." 

 "I stand corrected. So if that's all that's standing in the way, why don't we get your stuff and move you inside with me." 

 "Is that all, Casanova? What could possibly induce me to enter your fiendish lair of iniquity?" 

 "First, Don Juan? Really? Amoral womanizer, seducer of countless women, heedless of their marital status, age, or temperament? Don Quixote is more like it, misunderstood knight of purest chivalry and intentions, in search of his one lady love." I sidled up next to her while she held one of the fly tie-downs in place. "Dulcinea, my love. I've searched for you long and far. I've erected this monument to your beauty. Care to help me christen our castle?" I murmured with a cheesy Spanish accent. 

 She gave me a shove with her shoulder. "Cut it Alex. You don't want me. The only reason you chase me at all is because you can't have me. There're enough girls here who'd swoon to be chosen as your ladylove. Pick one and let's be done with it." 

 Truth was, she was kind of right. Not that I didn't like her, or that she wasn't attractive enough. We had been friends since we were kids, really close in middle school, but for the last couple of years there'd been an awkward feel to our friendship, which I felt could go haywire at any time. Besides, I had already given it a shot, only to be rejected repeatedly. Now she was off my radar. 7th grade crush gone bad. 

 I had my sights set on other, more tempting and much more available targets. I glanced over to where one of those targets was lingering over her own campsite, casting looks our way, some wistful, some irritated. I don't believe Julie Samuelson approved of the amount of attention that Teri was garnering. Call it a turf war. 

 But Teri was fun to tease, and once into the role, it was hard to back off. I stood and helped her to her feet. Leaning over I whispered, "You can't be more wrong. I like you a lot. Pretty, brilliant, and begging to be corrupted." My hand gently brushed her hair back, and caressed her cheek lightly. 

 She blushed heavily, stepping cautiously away. "See? That's what I'm talking about. Alex. Always pushing the limits. Quit the damn teasing and grow up. It's not like I don't know what you really like." She glanced over at the sexy young thing waiting her turn. "I can't believe anything you say. That is why you'd never catch me entering your tent, come Hell or high-water." 

 She turned away from me and marched off, looking even better walking away than she had approaching in the first place. What an ass. And I mean that in the nicest way. 

 Julie meandered over, acting casual, while I started moving my gear inside. I enjoyed watching her, almost laughing aloud at her antics. She was scanning the area, scoping out any possible competition, walking a serpentine path toward my well-delimited domain. As she got closer she adjusted her skin-tight shorts, brushed her mid-length platinum blonde hair back, licked her full red lips and a soft sway enveloped her heavenly hips. 

 I knew that, most of all, she was making sure her older sister Lisa wasn't in the area. Apparently, she didn't trust me either, especially with the little hottie that had blossomed over the summer. The term 'barely legal' was coined for innocent hotties like her. 

 She slowed down, posing, hip thrust out, one hand on her waist, the other playing with a lock of her radiant hair. "Hey Alex," she chirped cheerfully. 

 I pretended like I hadn't seen her approaching while I was spreading out my pad and sleeping bag inside the tent. I peered out of the opening, looking up at her. She was only a couple of feet away, and her outstanding ta-tas were between me and her face. She actually leaned forward a bit to peer down at me. 

 "Julie! Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. Good job on the tent. I saw you hammering in those stakes nice and deep. If we get a good storm, half those other tents are going to collapse or blow away." 

 I knew she'd only been biding her time, waiting to come over. Of the girls around the place, she was one of the few that made it deliciously obvious she'd like to be better acquainted. Unfortunately for her, Lisa, her elder, had put the kibosh on that. I wasn't certain why, but fantasized it was because she had her own sights set on me. Not fair, really, since the equally stunning older sister already had a boyfriend. 

 Julie grinned hugely, her perfect teeth peeking out from behind her mesmerizing lips. "Looks like your tent won't be going anywhere. I think it's built stronger than the cabin we passed on the way in." 

 "Do me a favor, gorgeous, pass me my pack?" 

 She reached over to grab it and almost fell over. The pack probably weighed almost half of what she did. She struggled with it, dragging it the 3 or 4 feet over to me. I lifted it easily, at least in comparison, and put it to the side. 

 Her head appeared in the doorway, and she peered in. "Nice. I bet I could stand up in there." 

 She was maybe 5' tall. Diminutive and sexy as hell, all the right curves in all the right places, exaggerated by her tiny stature. A living doll I'd love to unwrap and play with. "Want to give it a try? I won't bite." 

 She chuckled nervously, looking around again before stepping in. "We won't get in trouble?" 

 "Not while we're setting things up." I put my hand on her bare hip, just above her stupidly tight shorts, her skin baby soft, and guided her to the center. "You're right, a good eight inches to spare." I stood, having to bend over a good bit, putting my face very close to hers. "As for me, I think I need a bigger tent." 

 She giggled again, her eyes darting around, betraying her nervousness. My hand was still on her hip, closing minutely, holding her in place. I moved my lips to her ear. "It's going to be lonely in this big tent, all by myself." 

 I detected a faint tremble, and felt her warm breath on my neck. "You probably won't be alone." 

 I pressed my lips to her neck, tasting her smooth skin. "Promise?" 

 She gasped, her trembling more pronounced. "Lisa would kill me." Her hand moved hesitantly, a cautious creature inching forward, landing on my arm. 

 My lips glided across her cheek, seeking out hers. I held her head in my hand, turning it slightly, to signal my control over her. I pushed my tongue against her teeth, and she opened her mouth to me, letting me kiss her for a few seconds before returning my ardor. I pulled her closer, our bodies pressing together, her full tits smashed against my chest. Her arms eagerly embraced me. 

 I retreated, the hand on her waist descending smoothly, caressing her rear, while I released her head. She surprised me by leaning forward and stealing a second quick kiss. She was blushing bright enough to illuminate the tent. 

 Kneeling back down, I opened my backpack. "I'm going to change into my bathing shorts. Wait for me?" I peeled off my shirt and started opening my khaki shorts. 

 Poor sweet thing. She was thoroughly befuddled. When I started pushing my shorts down, she darted for the entrance. I watched her cute rump exit my tent. "I'll wait," she answered from outside. 

 Such an innocent. She didn't even peek in. 

 Too bad. I stroked myself a few times, thinking of playing with the cutie, giving my package a little extra heft before going down to the water and putting it on display. I was ready to do a little trolling. 

 A couple of minutes later we strolled down to the river, side-by-side. Apparently, she was willing to face the wrath of her sister, and be seen in my company. At least for the moment. I wonder if it was the kiss. 

 * * * 

 It was a fun afternoon, splashing around, playing in the water, chicken-fights, some Frisbee, a little 'accidental' groping, and a bit of sunning. A great start to the long weekend. 

 Except for one thing. 

 I wanted a new girlfriend. Scratch that, I needed one. I was tired of doing without sex, and liked having that one steady girl you could depend on for so many wonderful things. No matter what Teri said. In spite of all my flirting and teasing, I wasn't really a player. Hell, I had only slept with three girls in all of high-school, and all of them had graduated. I was ready to make it four. 

 The only question was who? Two of the girls I was seriously contemplating a relationship with were on this camp-out. Three if you counted Lisa, which I refused to do until she broke up with her current boyfriend. Sexy young Julie made the cut, as did the delightfully delicious Dominique. For the moment, Dominique seemed immune to my charms, although she was friendly enough. 

 Not that there weren't other potentials. Shit. Half the girls on the camp-out I would happily bounce bellies with, and that included Miss Shannon, our ever-so- female chaperon, and not-so-secret crush of mine. I'm certain that Teri would be a worthwhile conquest, and her tent-mate Heather was beyond doable. The only thing keeping her off my list was her open disdain for me. Not worth the effort to fight. No, I was better off concentrating on Julie and Dominique. 

 We had a simple campfire dinner of burgers and chips, and talked about the activities we had planned for the next day before our diligent chaperons reminded us of the rules. No leaving the camp area after 10:00, no swimming after lights-out, skirts up and pants down, indicating the need for the guys to go downstream and the girls upstream to go to the bathroom. Most of all, stay out of each other's tents. 

 Bunch of spoilsports. 

 Julie was under Lisa's watchful eye, and one of the underclassmen was doing his best to make time with her. When he looked my way, I gave him my best glare, and when Lisa wasn't looking, I did the old thumb across the throat gesture. I think he got the message. 

 With Julie occupied and under watch, at least for the moment, I sought out the stunning Dominique, easily the prettiest girl in camp, if we took Miss Shannon out of the equation. Dominique looked like a model, tall, slender, and graceful. She was a hard nut to crack though. Whenever I sat near her, she would clam up, obviously nervous around me, speaking in single word answers, or the briefest of phrases. If I casually touched her, she would jump to the stars, and I'd be hard-pressed to get her speaking for minutes afterwards. I kept coming back for more. You know the whole moth/flame thing. To me she blazed like the sun. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 01 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© I fantasized that if I was able to get Dominique alone, instead of surrounded by half the camp while sitting by the huge central fire, I'd have more luck. I'd have to do something about that. Luck favors the prepared. 

 Despite my best (or worst) intentions, I was in my sleeping bag, alone, before eleven, and planning my personal missions for the next day. 

 I'm certain of one thing. I slept better and more comfortably than most of the group. No sticks or stones digging into me, the doubled-up pad isolating me from the rough earth, my sleeping bag soft against my naked skin. 

 I could still hear a faint amount of rustling and muted conversation going on in the tents below me. 

 "Who else is sleeping naked?" I called out into the night. 

 I was bombarded with a chorus of, "Me!", "Ewww!", "TMI", and the requisite "Alex Hamilton - Enough of that!" from my favorite chaperon. 

 I relaxed into my bag. Day one shot. I had high hopes for day two. 

 * * * 

 I was one of the first up, getting the fire going, and putting two kettles to boil over the coals. Years of camping had me getting up with the sun when outdoors. I ambled down to the riverside, cleaning up as much as I could, running a comb through my hair, brushing my teeth, and making myself moderately presentable. When I had returned to the fire, a few weary souls were struggling out of their tents, stretching, and then heading up or downstream to take care of their immediate needs. 

 Miss Shannon Ryan, Humanities teacher extraordinaire, looking quite fetching in a light t-shirt and shorts, squirmed out of her tiny tent, scanning the campsite with a tired scowl. Her wild mane of dark red hair was particularly unruly, making me fantasize about being the one who'd mussed it up. I smiled when I saw her sniff the air, heading my way. 

 "Is that coffee?" 

 I held out a mug for her, which she accepted gratefully, inhaling its aroma deeply before taking a taste. "God bless you," she whispered, pursing her pretty lips and blowing on it before her second sip. She eased herself down to the log beside me, huddled over her steaming mug in the cool morning air. I glanced over and saw she wasn't wearing a bra, her nipples responding to the morning chill. Her sleeveless tee was too large, and from my angle, I had a dick hardening view of side boobage, maybe even a nipple. 

 I had a light windbreaker with me and placed it around her shoulders. She looked at me quizzically. 

 I nodded down to her chest. "The girls are standing at attention," I said softly. "I'm not complaining, but that's a little too much stimulation for some of the boys." 

 I wasn't sure how she'd respond, particularly in this environment but she took it in stride, slipping her arms into the jacket, and closing one snap right between her boobs. "Thanks, too early to be fending off the walking hormones. I'm not up to it at this ungodly hour." She took a sip. "I hope you got your fill." 

 I chuckled. "You know I'll never get my fill, but as an appetizer, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Little Alex thanks you as well." 

 Shit. I hadn't meant for that last bit to spill out. 

 She didn't even look my way. "Too far." 

 Enough said. It was our code. In a situation like ours, sometimes things got out of hand, one or the other had to draw the line. In the open campground, I guess Shannon figured my last comment was over the top. 

 I could challenge her, of course. But she was right. We had an unusual relationship, and not what you're thinking. It was too easily misinterpreted so we kept it cool in public. 

 I glanced back at her, and let her know I understood. "Sorry." 

 She looked up from her mug, smiling. "No you're not." 

 She had me there. "No I'm not. Not for the comment. But the time and place is all wrong." 

 Her eyes scanned the immediate area, observing the campers starting to slowly wander over. "You gonna be good this trip? Or am I going to have to tell your Mom?" 

 "Jeez, Shannon. The Mom card? Already?" 

 She gave me that evil look of hers, smirking, knowing she had won without even making a effort. I had nobody to blame but myself, and my neurotic need to help anyone in distress. Like a brand new teacher. 

 That's a different story. For a different time. 

 A few people were wandering toward the campfire, which was blazing nicely, while I continued to feed it. Needed a lot of hot coals for breakfast. "Coffee and hot chocolate's ready for anybody who wants some. Bring your own cup." 

 A couple of them were content to stand near the fire, stretching their hands forward toward the flames, warming up. Several others, however, scampered back to their tents, returning with a wide variety of cups in hand. 

 John showed up, close friend, fellow scout and second year member of the Outdoor Club. He sat down nearby holding a mug out, which I filled with coffee. "Man, it got cold last night. I'm glad I wasn't sleeping naked." 

 Miss Shannon almost spit up her coffee. "Inappropriate much?" she asked, peering at him. 

 "Hey, I didn't start it," he argued, looking at me pointedly. 

 "Don't remind me," she growled. She stared at me for a few seconds, and then went back to her coffee. "Dispensation for the coffee and jacket. Now clean it up, Mister Hamilton." 

 The last name thing was my warning. But I had to hand it to her, she always gave me the warning, an opportunity to reel myself in before she had to. In public Miss Shannon was cool. She could tease with the best of 'em, but was able to draw the line at how far things could go. I was always careful not to get carried away. A few different witty and salacious comments struggled within my head to be heard, but I successfully kept them at bay. Things you might get away with in private, among friends and family, did not play as well in public. 

 She looked over at me, raising one immaculately maintained eyebrow over those dark, sleepy, bedroom eyes, waiting for a smart-ass response. 

 Not today. Under the radar. Looking for some wiggle room in case things went my way later. I was being good. "Yes ma'am. Last thing I would want to do is cause any trouble for my all-time, number one, favorite teacher. Can I give you a refill?" 

 She smiled for me, secure in holding the upper hand, and held out her mug. I took her hands in one of mine, steadying them, while I poured the coffee. I took my time letting go of her hands, my thumb caressing the back of one, intimately. She didn't look at me, but I saw the beginning of a blush. 

 * * * 

 Miss Shannon's blush was about the best I did all day. Saturday was a training day. All of our activities predetermined, keeping us busy until almost sunset. The day had turned hot, high 80's at least, and the views were spectacular, but there was very little time for personal activities. The teachers paired us off when we did any projects, and it looked like Miss Shannon and Dr. Reed were determined to match me up with those who I had the least interest in being with. I would not put it past them to do it on purpose. 

 We were all tired by the time we settled in for our dinner, a huge pot of spaghetti, meat sauce, and toasted French bread. A large beverage cooler with punch and another with water, kept us hydrated. We took turns doing the cooking and cleanup, but I had volunteered to take care of the fire each morning, escaping most of the cooking and the dreaded cleanup. The meal was filling and there was enough to satisfy even the hungriest among us. 

 After we had our end of day wrap-up and were reminded of the camp rules and the following day's activities, things wound down and people wandered off on their own. I did a little housekeeping, hanging up my t-shirt from the day before to air out, and cleaning up my personal dishes. I had started on making my covered shelter more inviting by creating a fire space just in front of it, with a tall stack of wood behind it, creating both a heat reflector and a visual wall from the rest of the camp. Instant privacy. Now all I was looking for was a reason to need it. 

 I dug the fire pit out almost a foot deep, piling the excavated earth behind it and to the sides to help reflect the heat back into the covered area. The slope of the front of the pit made it easy to access the fire while enjoying it. I piled up the initial starter tinder and wood, only lacking a match to set it off. A large log, 'liberated' from a not-too-distant campsite, was lying lengthwise and would create an intimate seating area when the time was right. I'd had to recruit John's aid to get it in place, starting his grumbling. 

 Moving back down to the central area, I got John to help me build up a large stock of fallen wood for the communal fire, which in turn got several others participating, until the pile was almost the size of Julie. I also surreptitiously hauled out a canteen of Bacardi 151, and headed back to the main area. 

 People came and went, the conversation ebbing and flowing. By 10:00 it was getting a little cooler, nice after the heat of the day, and the wind had picked up a notch. I was happy enough to be parked between the sisters, Lisa and Julie, flirting openly with both, pleasantly surprised at Lisa's openness and willingness to play along. Julie had sought me out during dinner, and Lisa had joined us, seemingly content playing chaperon. We were all drinking the punch, which I'd openly spiked, with their approval. I was keeping the existence of the rum quiet. I did not have enough for everybody and if we were caught, there might be hell to pay. Best if that risk rested on my shoulders. 

 The crowd around the big common fire circle had broken up into half-a-dozen small groups, and I was more than content with my quiet corner of it. The fire was warm, the smoke was blowing away from us, and the log we were perched on comfortably worn down from countless rears before ours. As it got cooler, and the wind picked up, the groups seemed to collapse in upon themselves, huddling closer together, little black holes of teenage angst and desires. With the amount of desire I was feeling, I imagined our singularity was greater than most. 

 Miss Shannon passed by and, obviously sucked in by our gravitational field, leaned over me a second and placed my jacket in my lap. I'd completely forgotten about it. "Thanks," she said. "I think I'm fine now." 

 I turned toward her, giving a quick glance down at her breasts. "That's too bad. You know where I live if you need it again." 

 She gave me that look that warned me I was treading on thin ice while sipping from her ever-present coffee mug. The woman was a caffeine junkie. I rolled the dice of chance, standing up, my back to the fire, hiding my actions. "Umm, can I give you a little something for your coffee?" I held out the thermos, so she could catch a whiff. 

 She took a sniff then looked up at me with a look of caution. "Alex..." 

 I moved closer and spoke very softly. "Just a drop. To take the edge off. It has to last the whole weekend." I tipped the bottle over toward her mug, and she held it steady. Good enough for me. I poured her an ounce or so. 

 She moved even closer, almost touching me, lowering her voice. "Who knows?" 

 "Just the four of us, at the moment." 

 "Keep it that way. If anyone gets drunk, I'll have your ass." 

 "Don't tease me, you wicked thing," I whispered back, grinning mischievously. "For an offer like that I'd get everyone shit-faced." 

 "Alex!" she hissed. 

 I had been teasing Miss Shannon for almost a year now, ever since shortly after she came to our school. I'd ended up helping her out of a situation, and in the doing she'd become friends with my family, and my mother in particular. She knew of my strong feelings for her, and there had been a possibility of reciprocation, once upon a time. But cooler heads had prevailed, and things eased back to the current level of public teasing and private flirtation. She was a teacher and I was a student, at least for the rest of this year. As much as I lusted for her, I liked her too much to jeopardize her name and career. I had to be content with fond memories of one warm evening when she almost became my third. 

 "I'm just kidding, Shannon. I would never do anything to get you in trouble. You must know that by now, right? I'll keep it cool." 

 She shook her head, sighing. She sipped her coffee, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. She opened her eyes looking up into mine. "Take it easy on that stuff, OK?" 

 "Of course. Let me know if you'd like some more." 

 "You're not trying to get me drunk, are you?" she whispered, her eyes sparkling. The edge of her mouth turned up just a hint. 

 "Here? With all these people around? Not a chance." 

 She rolled her eyes at me. "I'm not sure that makes me feel any safer." 

 "I promise. Scout's Honor." I grinned, holding up the scout salute, then crossing my first two fingers, a skill I'd worked on diligently. 

 "Damn, you can be a pain in my ass." 

 The responses I had for that were almost overwhelming. I thought I was going to bite my tongue off reining them in. "I know. Believe me, your patience is very much appreciated. Keeping you locked in at the top of my favorite teacher list. Number one with a bullet." 

 She rolled her eyes at me, and then stepped over to the sisters, addressing them. "The devil. He is the devil. Sweet talker like that is nothing but trouble. Watch out for him." 

 Lisa almost killed me when she answered. "Oh, we know. We watch out for each other," she said with a nod toward her sister. "You better watch out too." 

 Our teacher's eyes opened wide, and I almost laughed aloud when she turned away, lost for words. 

 "Wounded. I'm mortally wounded, Lisa," I told her with a disappointing shake of my head as I sat back down, squeezing in between them. 

 "Poor baby. Don't worry, you'll do fine. There are enough girls around here that aren't aware of your game, Casanova." 

 "Casanova? First Teri calls me Don Juan, and now Casanova? What's with you girls?" 

 She looked at me like I had two heads. 

 Teri had been sitting nearby, sort of between groups, eavesdropping on both. She was now watching our wordplay from the next log over. She twisted her torso around, scooting a bit closer, poking her nose in. "What's with you, Casanova? Camp full of cuties and you're setting one sister against the other? You'd have Lisa cheating on Darryl, but dollars to donuts you'd be doing the same with sweet cheeks given half a chance." She was grinning hugely, getting her kicks out of poking me with her verbal sharp stick. 

 Honestly, I was a little shocked. "Cheat? Me? Why would you say that? I have never cheated on a girlfriend. I mean, flirt, and joke around, sure. We're all having fun. But I'm not a cheater." I was quite vehement in my own defense, attracting more attention than I had intended. 

 I guess I was a little too vociferous, and I saw Teri shrink back a bit. "I was just teasing," she said. 

 My anger was slow to cool, but I didn't want to make a huge scene. "Alright. Let's talk about cheating. I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, right?" I lowered my voice and leaned forward. Teri had to scoot closer and lean in to hear me. I grinned. She was doomed. Captured by our gravity well. 

 She nodded, and the sisters on each side of me leaned in as well, adding an additional modicum of privacy to our discussion. 

 "What's cheating? Where do we draw the line? Who's to say if someone's cheating? If I were to kiss Lisa, right here right now, would that be cheating? She has a boyfriend. Would kissing Julie afterward be cheating? Kissing two different girls?" 

 It was funny to hear three different responses. Lisa was quick to answer, "Of course!" 

 Julie was hot on her heels saying "No way." 

 Teri? She took the weak ass middle road, "It depends." 

 I looked at each of the sisters. I reached out for Lisa, pulled her close and gave her a brief peck on the lips. Without waiting for her reaction, I turned to Julie, and gave her a kiss as well, less of a peck, since she seemed eager to respond. 

 "Now. Did she cheat? Did I cheat on either one of them?" I turned to Lisa, "Did I cheat on you, kissing your sister?" 

 She seemed a little shocked, and shook her head no. 

 "How about you?" I asked, turning to Julie. 

 "No." 

 I waved Teri closer, "Come here." 

 She shook her head, looking nervous. 

 "Come. Here." I said more firmly, pointing directly in front of me. 

 She looked at me, then the sisters, before scooting forward and kneeling right in front of Julie, inches from me. I reached out and held her jaw in my hand, leaned in and kissed her hard. I pulled her chin down, encouraging her to open her mouth, and slid my tongue between her lips. I'd known her eight years and it was the first time I'd really kissed her. She whimpered softly before opening her mouth and meeting my tongue with hers. We kissed for several seconds, before I pulled away. 

 "Who did we cheat on just now?" 

 She looked at me with confusion, and a hint of anger. "Nobody, but that's not a fair question." 

 "Why not?" 

 "It's all in the intention. If I was your girlfriend, then kissing them would be cheating." 

 I sat back and looked at the girls on each side of me. Interestingly, Teri kept her place, kneeling at my feet. "Is she right?" 

 Lisa was quick to answer. "Maybe." 

 "Maybe? God, you guys are wishy-washy. How is it 'maybe' cheating? It's only a kiss, damn it!" 

 "If you mean it," Lisa insisted, "if the kiss is meant as wanting more, I'd think it's cheating. The kiss you gave me, it's not cheating. If you kissed me like you kissed her," she nodded toward Teri, "that could be cheating." 

 I sat back, taking a sip of my punch, while the wind blew the dying fire back to life. The temperature was still dropping to the point where it was getting chilly, and the fire was failing to keep up. Perfect excuse to move our little party. 

 "Excuse me a minute, ladies. I'll be right back, and we can continue this debate." I passed my half-finished mug of spiked punch to Teri, who took my spot as soon as I got up. I grabbed a nicely flaming log from the fire and jogged the couple of dozen steps to my shelter, putting it under my tinder pile, starting a nearly instant blaze. 

 I climbed into my tent and retrieved my large wool blanket. Essential camping and survival gear. I fed my nascent fire, and headed back down to my waiting trio of lovelies. 

 "Ladies, let's move this party up the hill. It's getting a little chilly out here, and my wind shelter will keep us nice and warm." Julie and Lisa seemed eager to follow my direction. Teri appeared to have some reservations, but followed along since it was either that or get left behind. I got them seated, Teri in the middle bracketed by the sisters, and wrapped the blanket across all of their shoulders, with a good bit left to wrap around the outside of each of the sisters. 

 I turned back to the fire, stacking a few more logs and getting the flames soaring. The difference in heat was obvious. I went back to the girls and took all their mugs for another refill at the beverage box, adding an ounce of liquid uninhibitor to each one. I filled a fourth cup for myself. 

 Teri started to get up when I got back to them, but I told her to stay put. Not like she would listen. She slid off the log, sitting on the grass, and once I'd sat back down in my original place, she leaned back into me, between my open legs, her arms resting on my thighs, facing the fire. I reached down and rubbed her shoulders. "Comfy?" 

 "Not bad," she replied casually. 

 Both Lisa and Julie moved in closer pulling the blanket tight to keep them warm. It was a cozy little private nest that I was at the center of. 

 "Back to cheating," I announced. "Gotta confess, I don't get it. We're all on such clearly different wavelengths. For me cheating is pretty simple. You're dating someone. You're sleeping with them. You've told each other you're committed. Then you do the deed with a stranger. That's cheating." Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 01 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© "Do the deed?" Julie asked. 

 "Coitus, intercourse, the two-backed beast." Teri expounded, peeking back over her shoulder. "Sex." 

 Lisa poked me. "Really? That's the only way to cheat? Let me guess, if you pull out, it's not cheating, huh?" 

 "Hey. I didn't say that. If you have sex to the point where you finish, it's cheating whether you come inside or out." 

 Teri decided to pile on. "If you accidentally slid your python into some poor thing, but you managed to pull away before you came, that's not cheating?" 

 "I, I guess it depends," I stammered. 

 "Ah-HA! Who's the wishy-washy one now!" Lisa gloated. She bumped me with her shoulder and smacked me on the leg. I noticed that afterward her hand stayed there, warm against my inner thigh. 

 "What about umm, oral," Julie asked, sounding sincerely curious. "Cheating or not?" 

 "Giving or getting?" I asked. 

 "Jesus Alex! Like there's a difference? How can oral not be cheating?" Teri snapped. 

 "Shhh," I cautioned her after she raised her voice. "I was going to say that giving is cheating. I mean, you're in control. On the other hand, you wouldn't call rape cheating would you? Of course not. So if I was on the receiving end and I was encouraging it, it could be cheating, but if I was just a participant, no." 

 Julie seemed to have the most problem grasping the nuances of our discussion. "I don't get it. If you had a girlfriend now, like me, but Teri turned around and gave you a BJ, that's not cheating 'cause you didn't ask for it?" 

 Teri pulled away from me, as if she had touched a hot coal. "Why me? Why am I the one giving the blow-job?" she asked angrily. 

 Julie chuckled cutely. "You're not. But if someone were going to, you're right there." The little cutie nodded toward my crotch where the conversation was having its effect on me. 

 Teri pretended not to notice. "Can we change the subject?" She artfully moved back between my legs where I could continue to rub her shoulders, neck and temple, carefully avoiding any indication she was pressed against my hardness. 

 Lisa leaned against me. "I guess we never will agree on what cheating is." 

 I laughed. "Of course we can. Maybe everybody can't but every couple can. It's easy enough. If I was lucky enough to be dating you, and we were intimate, and I had managed to somehow maintain my sanity after our first time together, you would get to determine the limits. You tell me what you would consider to be cheating and I wouldn't do it." I had lifted my arm around her and given her a firm hug. 

 "Why are we arguing about it then?" She shocked me to the core when she took my face in her hands and turned me toward her. She moved within a few inches of my face, staring intently into my eyes. "Never have sex with anybody but me, and always come back to me, and everything else is forgiven," I sensed no joking in her statement. Her lips closed the distance between us with a soft kiss that in any other circumstance I would have assumed sealed the deal. 

 But this wasn't any other circumstance. She had a boyfriend, and I was embraced by her sister on one side, and my best friend Teri between my legs, leaning back against my aching hard-on. 

 I drew back from her, watching her eyes for any hint of teasing or joking, but they seared through my soul, an open invitation if I dared to take her up on it. 

 I was a coward. 

 I turned to my old friend, a safe haven in times of confusion. "How about you Teri? What would our version of cheating be, between you and me?" I teased her, sliding my hands down her front, across the top of her breasts for a few inches, stopping before her nipples. 

 "Not happening. You know it." She grabbed my wrists and moved them up just a bit. 

 "I know, but if it did. Where would you draw the line?" I slid my hands to the sides, feeling the firmness of her smallish tits. 

 "Not. Happening," she repeated, grabbing my wrists, but not pushing them away. 

 "But if it did..?" I curled my fingers under her breasts, always pushing her limits. 

 "Hypothetically?" 

 "Hypothetically." 

 She sighed and leaned back, tilting her head way back and looking up at me upside down, giving me a chance to grope her tits for just a second, before I slid my hands back up to her shoulders. "I'm selfish. I don't want another woman to ever see your thing. Don't touch their privates. Stay off their breasts. No tongue when kissing. Don't profess your love or desire for them. Don't get hard for them. No porn. And anytime you backslide, you inform me immediately." She turned, her upper arm leaning into my crotch. "Quite demanding, huh? Still interested?" 

 I leaned down and gave her a kiss on the forehead. "If I was involved with you, and that's what it took to keep you happy and maintain the peace, it'd be a small price to pay." 

 "Bullshit. Easy to say, but I doubt you could stay faithful a single day." 

 I sighed dramatically. "You wound me again, beautiful, ornery lady." I turned to Julie. "Same question. If you and I were dating and in a committed relationship, what would you want me to do or not do? What would be cheating?" 

 She smiled easily and nuzzled under my arm. "That's easy. When you're my boyfriend, I don't want you to do anything behind my back you wouldn't do in front of me." 

 I nearly leaped out of my skin as did the ladies around me, when a voice broke in from behind us. "Now that may be the best answer I've heard yet." Miss Shannon. I wondered how long she had been listening. I heard her giggle, "Sorry, didn't mean to scare you all. Nice little private party you have here Mr. Hamilton. I would appreciate it if next time you warned me before starting a second fire. Let's try to wrap it up OK, it's getting late." 

 Looking downhill, I saw the main campfire was almost abandoned. Two small groups were all that remained. 

 "And you probably have to stay up as long as us, to make sure nobody misbehaves, right?" 

 "You got it, bucko. Making me hike up here isn't making my job any easier." 

 I pulled out my canteen of rum and offered it to her. She took it, gave it a shake to see how much we'd polished off, and recharged her drink. "Miss Shannon, I promise you we will all retire to our own tents in the next 30 minutes, and we won't do anything behind your back we wouldn't do in front of you." 

 She passed me back my canteen. "OK. But I'm going to hold you to that." She peeked over the blanket at the three girls. "What did I tell you about him? He's dangerous. Watch out for each other." 

 Teri grinned large. "Us? You're the only one he's committed to so far. Nothing behind your back he wouldn't do in front of you?" 

 That had the girls in a giggle fit, and had Miss Shannon headed off for one last tour of the camp, her red face lighting the way. 

 I gave Teri a shake. "You are rotten." 

 She stifled her giggles, struggling up from her position. "Ow, my legs are getting cramped." She waved her mug around, my spare mug to be precise. "Anybody else in need of a refill?" 

 Both Julie and Lisa passed over their empty mugs, and as soon as Teri was gone, Lisa slid into her place. "That shoulder rub looked nice," she hinted. 

 The girl was nothing but surprises. Nice ones I might add. I laughed, reaching down and rubbing her soft shoulders. I tilted her head back and gave her a short soft kiss on the lips, then went back to loosening her muscles, working around her neck. I turned to Julie, who was patiently leaning against me. I leaned toward her and she met me halfway, delivering a long wonderful kiss. 

 She pulled away and wrapped her arm around my back. "So Alex. Am I asking too much of my boyfriend?" 

 "What do you think, Lisa?" I deflected the question. 

 "She's right. I like her answer better than mine. It seems simple enough. Nothing behind my back. If you do it in front of me, and I don't like it, then we can talk about it, but there's no surprises. And this way, there might even be things that I might think would bother me but turn out not to," she answered, wriggling under my hands. She turned sideways, her arm resting on my leg, her shoulder and side pushing against my hardness. 

 She looked up at me, eyes big, a small expectant smile on her full lips. She tilted her head back when she saw me staring at her lips, parting them fractionally. I reached down and stroked her hair, before kissing her, slowly and warmly, closing my eyes and losing myself in it. Damn, why did she have to be taken? 

 I pulled back and Julie was turned toward me, straddling the log, her breasts pressed against me. I caught my breath after the surprising older sister kiss. "Any ideas about things you thought might bother you and didn't?" I asked, while Julie's young lips mapped out the exposed flesh around my neck and chest. 

 "Yeah," Lisa answered in a voice full of need. "Like seeing you kiss my baby sister, Heaven help me." 

 With her sister's explicit encouragement I pulled Julie close and kissed her as ardently as I had her sister. I moaned into her mouth when I felt Lisa openly rubbing my cock. 

 "Jesus!" I heard Teri exclaim from a distance. "I go to take a tinkle, and I return to Sodom and Gomorrah." 

 Julie looked contrite, as she settled in next to me, arms still holding me tight. Lisa turned, obscuring the fact that a large wet spot was developing on my shorts. Darker color shorts next time. 

 Teri passed out the mugs, and then settled in beside me. She kept a few inches away, and squealed softly when I pulled her in close, kissing her as well. "Welcome back, Bestie." 

 "Did I say you could kiss me?" she snapped. 

 "I'll stop if you tell me to." 

 She heaved a huge sigh as if she was the most put upon person in the world. "What did I miss?" she asked giving me a warning glance. 

 Julie grinned. "Lisa said she could go along with my idea of cheating." 

 Teri was not quite as willing to jump aboard that train. "It sounds right, I'll admit. I just don't know. If you ended up with a guy like shameless here, who knows what he'd try to do in front of you? Probably everything I just told him not to do, just to test me. Constantly pushing boundaries." 

 She leaned her head against my shoulder. "How come you haven't picked out your next girlfriend yet, Alex?" she asked softly. 

 "I don't get to just pick them. There's a mutual element to it you know. They have to pick me back." 

 "Semantics. How come?" she argued. "You haven't been without a girlfriend for more than a couple of weeks in the last three years. It can't be that hard." 

 Lisa nudged her shoulder against my painful erection and giggled, before joining in. "What's your process? I'd love to know. It's so easy for guys. They get to make all the decisions. We girls have to wait to see who's interested and then decide if we're willing to accept their choices." 

 "It's not that easy. Nobody likes to be shot down, or made fun of." 

 Julie whispered softly. "I'd never do that, Alex." 

 I smiled, giving her a tender kiss. "I know, Angel." 

 "She's right. Who around here would turn you down?" Teri insisted. 

 "You mean besides you?" 

 "Please. You're never serious, always teasing. How do you decide for real?" 

 I had never really given it much thought. "I guess it starts with narrowing down the field. Who would I like to be with if I could? I guess I'm picky. Fun, pretty, smart, good company, I don't want just any girl. I imagine I'm like most guys. I have a list in my head of the top babes. I have enough of an ego to believe I deserve them." 

 That got Lisa's attention, getting her to turn partially around again. She was getting naughtier. She lifted her arm and rested her wrist on my steely shaft. "You've got to tell us. Who's on the list? Anybody here at camp?" 

 "Spill," Teri chimed in, giving me a poke in the side. 

 I felt Julie's lips by my ear. "Please?" she whispered before nibbling my earlobe. 

 Shit. This was looking dangerous. So far, being open with them had been beyond interesting. I'd never expected any of what was going on. "Two are here." 

 Julie's voice betrayed her nervousness. "Anyone we know?" 

 I reached around and gave her a warm hug, almost spilling her drink. "You, pretty girl are definitely high on the list." 

 Her sweet smile was bright enough to light the heavens. Damned if I didn't see tears in her eyes. She hugged me tightly, whispering, "Just ask." 

 I kissed her forehead, waiting for the fallout from the other two. 

 "Who's the other?" Teri asked, seeming more curious than anything. 

 "Dominique." 

 Lisa moved her hand over my hardness, giving me a not so subtle squeeze. "Dominique? Really? You hardly even speak to her." 

 "I know. She seems a little out of my league, and immune to my boyish good looks and boundless charm." 

 "Puh-lease! You've got to be kidding. She'd go for you in a heartbeat. I happen to know you're at the top of her list." 

 "You guys have lists?" 

 "Well, Duh! We all talk about it, just like you." 

 "I don't talk about it. I've never even told anybody but you three." 

 Lisa was scratching her fingernails down my shaft, driving me crazy. "We all talk. The guys we'd choose if we could. Who our favorites are. You must know you're on a lot of lists." 

 "Yours?" I asked, teasing. 

 She looked at me quite seriously, before nodding. "But I guess I'm not on yours," she pouted, breaking my heart. 

 I reached down and ran my fingers through her hair. "True confession time. All three of you would make up the top of my list, except that two of you have issues." 

 Lisa's unobtrusive stroking stopped. "Issues? What kind of issues?" 

 "Come on Lisa. You're taken. There's no way anyone as fun, sweet and gorgeous as you wouldn't be at the top of everyone's list, but once you're out of the game, you're off the list. Believe me, I wish you weren't, but I wouldn't do that to you or Darryl." 

 "So you're saying if I wasn't dating Darryl..." 

 "Top 3." 

 "Not number one?" she asked with a smirk. 

 "You really think it's fair to ask?" I glanced over at her sister. 

 "I take it I have issues, too?" Teri asked, her voice less playful. "It's not 'cause I'm taken." 

 "No, it's not that." 

 "What is it?" she asked sharply. 

 "I'd rather not say," I answered. 

 "Oh, right. You're suddenly mister close-mouthed. Go ahead. Give it to me. What's the problem?" 

 "You know." 

 She was definitely irritated. "Because I'm a virgin? Saving it?" 

 "Now that's crazy. Every girl I've ever been with so far has been a virgin." 

 "Oh, Mister Cherry Popper! How many virgins have you slain? Ten? A Dozen? More?" 

 "Stop it Teri." I said softly, trying to pull her closer. 

 She fought me. "Come on, I know you're dying to share. How many?" 

 I looked down at Lisa, and was disappointed to see she looked just as eager to find out. "Three," I finally admitted. 

 "Three?" Teri responded, sounding confused. 

 Lisa chimed in as well. "Three? You've dated more girls than that." 

 "Three. Three! That's it! Happy?" I barked. 

 Julie reached up and touched my cheek. "Shh," she said. "Nobody's judging you, Alex." 

 Teri moved away from me. "I call bullshit. I know more than that many who have told me they slept with you." 

 "Who?" I asked. 

 "Who?" she faltered. "I can't say, but there's more." 

 "Who?" I demanded sharply. "I'll tell you who's lying." 

 She got quiet for a moment. "Angela," she said, challenging me. 

 My girlfriend for over a year. And the only girl I'd slept with more than half- a-dozen times. "True." 

 "Maria." 

 My girlfriend, before Angela. And my first. "True." 

 "Denise." 

 "Nope. Didn't happen. Not even close. Second base." 

 Teri looked at me in disbelief. "You're kidding right? She told us all about it, and I'll be honest, she made you sound awfully good." 

 "A lie. Didn't happen. Not every likely to. Not even in my top 10." 

 Teri seemed shocked. "Heather?" 

 "Heather? Which Heather? Not Heather in your tent?" I asked in open disbelief. 

 She nodded. 

 "Jesus! Why would she say that? She doesn't even like me! I've never so much as kissed her." 

 "I thought your families stayed at the same resort last summer? Didn't you guys hook up? That's why she's mad at you. You used her and dumped her at the end of the summer." 

 I shook my head in complete bewilderment. "No. Not Heather. I did make a friend on that vacation, a local girl. We played around a good bit, but never went all the way. She was saving it." I gave Teri a meaningful glance. "I'd have been willing to go out with Heather, but she was already involved with family friends and I didn't have a chance." 

 "Who?" Teri asked. 

 "I'm not going to say." 

 "C'mon. She lied about you, you could at least tell the truth about her," Teri argued. 

 "I don't talk about that stuff. Not to anyone. Not my relationship, not other peoples'. Sorry. Would you want me to be talking about you, if we did anything?" 

 Lisa had been hanging on every word. "Kaitlyn?" 

 "Graduated last year?" I asked. 

 "Yeah." 

 How did she know? That was the secret one. Totally private. But I wasn't going to veer from my path of honesty. "Yep. Now you know all of 'em." 

 "Was it last Spring Break?" Lisa insisted. 

 Damn! She was good. And I knew where this was heading. "Possibly." 

 Teri interrupted, "While you were still with Angela! And that's not cheating?" 

 "No. Angie was there when it happened. And that's all I'm going to say on that subject." 

 Lisa by this time had turned almost completely around and her breasts were cradling my hard-on, intentionally or not. "You're kidding. Both of them?" 

 "They were best friends. It just happened, OK? Not planned, and not repeated." At least not with both of them. "I didn't think anybody knew. Can we drop it?" 

 Lisa put her hands on my chest. "Alex, you have to share. They're not here. We won't tell. You wouldn't be hurting anyone. Pretty much everyone knows you were with them, just not at the same time." 

 "Funny, how I'm the one doing all the sharing." 

 She leaned closer moving up and down enough to make it clear to me at least, that she knew exactly where my cock was happily residing. "Please. I promise, I'll tell you anything you want to know about me. Everything." She looked over at her sister. "So will Julie. I swear. Right Jules?" 

 Julie had remained quiet. "Of course. I'll tell you anything." 

 Teri sounded almost sad when she said, "I'd tell you everything, if there was anything to tell. Or anything you didn't already know." 

 I sighed. "There's not that much to tell. And it never leaves this circle. Agreed?" 

 The girls all nodded in expectation, pulling in closer. The wind was really picking up, gusting, and I could hear the occasional drop of rain landing on the tarp overhead. Better get this show on the road. I stood and stepped around Lisa to tend the fire for a moment, while getting my thoughts in order. I took a large, courage fortifying drink from my mug, and then moved back to my place on the log, with the three girls instantly molding themselves to me. Pretty incredible. 

 "It should be no surprise that Angela and I were doing a lot together. I was her first. She was my second. We did what we could when we could, but it wasn't enough for either of us." I lowered my voice, and looked around, before taking another big sip of the rum-punch. I was starting to really feel it, which was good under the current situation. 

 "We went down to Kaitlyn's beach house over Spring Break. David was supposed to have come with us, but they broke up a couple of days before we went, so she was alone. She was really bummed out about it. He didn't know it, but that weekend she had plans to give him her virginity. She'd even gotten on the pill, in case it became a regular thing. Idiot didn't deserve her. Kaitlyn was a little irritated that every time her parents were gone for even a few minutes, Angela and I were going at it, sometimes leaving her on watch, reminding her of what she was missing out on." Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 01 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© Lisa was driving me nuts, still pressing my cock between her breasts, while looking up at me while I spoke. 

 "Kaitlyn's Aunt and Uncle were supposed to come down for the second weekend, and her parents left us in their care. But the weather turned bad, and since all they do is golf every day, they decided to wait until after the storm blew over. Leaving us alone. As soon as we got the word they were going to be delayed a couple of days, we started drinking and fooling around. Angela and I were getting bad, doing it anywhere and everywhere. We'd never been alone like that for so long. A house to ourselves. The first couple of times we did it around Kaitlyn, she'd just leave, but finally she just sat beside us, ignoring us, while Angela sat in my lap and we watched a movie together, screwing the whole time." 

 The girls were clinging to my every word. I put my hand on Lisa and eased her away from me. "You've gotta stop that, beautiful, or I'm going to make a mess." She blushed hard, and moved back just a little. "God, I can't believe I'm telling you guys this." 

 I looked around to see if they wanted me to go on. It seemed obvious. 

 "We were getting more and more blatant. By the time the movie ended the first night, we were all pretty drunk. Angela and I were both naked, and Kaitlyn was wearing a threadbare t-shirt and panties. I'll be honest, it was driving me crazy to have her around. 

 "'Are you guys always like this?' Kaitlyn asked. 

 "Angela laughed at her. 'Never, I think he's getting off on having my best friend watch us.' 

 "I was pretty worn out, but Angela slipped between my legs and took me in her mouth, right in front of Kaitlyn, shocking her. 

 "'You're kidding me, right? Again?' she gasped. 

 "I was tempted to beg off, but Angela changed my mind pretty quickly. 'Just one more. Help me?' she asked." 

 Teri gasped, "She asked for her help?" 

 I nodded. "She didn't ask for much. She pleaded with Kaitlyn to take off her shirt. 'Please,' she asked. Kaitlyn did, then she rubbed her tits for me and moved in real close. She even told me I could touch them. Between Angela's blow-job and playing with Kaitlyn's big tits, I got hard again, and Angela climbed on my lap for another ride. I was still playing with Kaitlyn's tits, and she got on her knees and let me suck them. Apparently that worked Angie up even more than me. I heard the change in her breathing, felt a new urgency in her actions. I was getting a little crazy, touching Kaitlyn all over, sliding my hand into her panties, urging her to take them off, until she was naked and coming on my hand. Once her friend came for me, it set Angie off and she exploded, the first of many intense orgasms on that ride. But it seemed no matter how long we fucked, I wasn't going to come again. Angela eventually climbed off of me, and grabbed both of us by the hand and dragged us to the bed." 

 Lisa was back to doing bad things with her tits and my cock. "All three of you naked in bed? Is that when you screwed her?" 

 "No. Everything but that. It was crazy. We spent that night and the whole next day playing around. I was still screwing Angela, but I spent a lot of time underneath the two of them, with Kaitlyn parked on my face. They blew me together, and I could do pretty much anything I wanted except fuck Kaitlyn. At one point Angela even let Kaitlyn try me for just a minute, so yeah, I was inside of her, not the whole way, but enough to make it official. I just held her while she lay on top of me, and we didn't move. She seemed to like that a lot. Kaitlyn got so worked up she was even able to come for me, without my doing anything but hold her and kiss her. That was amazing. Really intense, feeling her shaking and trembling while she came for me. I had to pull out of her, and Angela finished me off with her mouth while Kaitlyn clung to me. After dinner that night, Angela finally gave in and said she wanted to see me do her friend. Take her virginity for real." 

 "God, I'm so jealous," Julie whispered to me. 

 "After almost 24 hours of having to stop short, given the green light I got a little crazy. I should have treated her gently, and made a special moment out of it, but I wanted her so bad I was burning up with desire. I got on top of her, and without any more foreplay, forced my entire length inside of her in one hard stroke, making her scream my name. Jesus, if y'all only knew what it was like to hear your name from a woman's lips while you're fucking her. It's like an adrenaline shot to the brain. We screwed for hours, and now I could take turns on them. I spent most of the time in Kaitlyn, since it was probably my one and only chance. Even after we went to sleep, I woke up and had Kaitlyn twice more. She got up to get a drink, and I followed her to the kitchen and did her on the table. I couldn't get enough of her. I probably spent three or four hours that night, constantly hard and always in somebody's mouth or pussy. It was epic. Best fucking night of my life." 

 I sat back sipping my drink while Lisa slowly rubbed her tits up and down on my cock, completely open about it. She was rubbing her nipples against me, first one, then the other. The girl had no shame. God, there was so much to like about her. Where the hell had this come from? 

 "The next morning, Kaitlyn left us so I could have one more turn with Angela in private before the Aunt and Uncle arrived. We never even talked about it after that, although we'd occasionally drop hints, but it was clearly a one-time thing." 

 I looked down at Lisa. "Lisa, if you don't stop right now, I'm going to lose it." 

 She had that look of a kid caught with her hand in the cookie jar. "I'm sorry, but that was sooo fucking hot." 

 Julie spoke up. "And you guys never did it again?" 

 "She got back together with David a week later." 

 "You didn't answer the question," Lisa said with a mischievous grin. 

 "Fine. Over the summer, after Angela and I ended it and she went off to college, Kaitlyn and I got together a few times before she had to leave." I looked over at Teri. "Those were the only three. Do you believe me now?" 

 Teri leaned against me. "I'm sorry about what I said about cheating. I didn't know. I thought what they'd said was true." 

 "And that's our biggest issue. You and me. You don't trust me. You always think I'm lying to you and find the worst in anything I say." 

 "No I don't," she argued, but she knew I was right, and her heart wasn't in it. 

 "I wish it wasn't true," I told her. I lifted her face to mine and gave her a kiss. "How many times have I told you I like you and asked to move our relationship further?" 

 "You're just teasing me," she said sullenly. 

 "See? You still don't believe me. I've never lied to you about that. Never." 

 "But you're always joking about stuff, like 'christening your castle.'" 

 "You're right, I do now. I joke because it's easier to take getting shot down if it sounds like I'm kidding than when I'm serious." 

 "You should have said something," Teri kept arguing. 

 I sighed. "Whatever. You're going to hear what you want to hear, and believe what you want to believe. And that's why you're no longer in my top five." 

 I pulled back a bit, and made a show of looking at my watch. "And now I'm going to go to bed, and so are you guys, like we promised Miss Shannon. And nobody is ever going to breathe a word of what I told you here tonight, to anybody. Right?" 

 "Wait," Lisa said, grabbing me. 

 I stopped. "What?" 

 "Who are the others? The ones that aren't here?" 

 "I don't think it matters. I've made up my mind already, and they're no longer in the picture." I got up and started folding up the blanket. The wind was gusting hard, and I was afraid we were going to get hit with a big storm, not the showers predicted. 

 The girls were still all standing around, as if they didn't know where to go. Finally Teri, came up to me and pulled me down for a kiss on the cheek. "I really am sorry, Alex. Do you think maybe we can talk about it a little tomorrow?" 

 I gave her a hug. "Bestest girl since sixth grade? I'll always have time for you." 

 She hugged me back, gave me another peck and headed for her tent. 

 Looking around, I could see we were the last ones up. The main fire was deserted. "Goodnight girls," I said, heading to my tent for one of the half- dozen tarps I'd brought. I took it back to our woodpile, covering it, and before I knew it, the sisters were helping me. I scattered the fire so it could burn out. "It's starting to rain. I've got this. You guys should go to bed." 

 Julie came to me, wrapping her arms around my neck. "Thanks for sharing with us. This was the greatest night ever." She drew me down for a long hot kiss that curled my toes. Afterward she looked over toward her sister. 

 "Go ahead," Lisa said. "I'll be with you in a second." 

 "I'm going to take down this fly, so it doesn't blow away," I explained to Lisa who still gave no indication of leaving. 

 I didn't put the fly away, I just took it down, folding it up in thirds and staked it down thoroughly. Lisa helped. When I was done, she moved next to me. "You and I need to talk, OK? Don't make any big decisions before we chat, please?" 

 I was afraid she was going to try to make her sister off-limits. That was going to be an ugly chat. It must have showed on my face. 

 She slid her hand in mine. "Nothing bad, Alex, I promise. It's just that tonight has been eye opening." She moved in for a hug, as the bigger raindrops started falling. "I had a great time with you tonight. A lot better than I expected to, to be totally honest. I think I had let your rep get to me." 

 "Rep?" 

 "We'll talk about it tomorrow. Can I have a kiss goodnight, too?" 

 She needn't have asked. I kissed her there under the trees for several minutes, getting acquainted with much of her awesome body. It was surreal, holding her in the soft rain. "Go, you're going to get soaked." I told her, turning her away, and patting her ass. 

 She blew me a kiss, and ran over to her tent. 

 I walked over to Miss Shannon's tent. "Shannon, you still awake?" I asked softly, trying to avoid attention. 

 It was silent for a moment. "What are you up to, Mr. Hamilton?" 

 Uh-oh. Mr. Hamilton. She was not happy with me. "The girls have gone to bed. Everyone else too. It looks like a storm is coming. I'm going to secure a few things around the camp. I wanted you to know, in case you heard anything going on out here." 

 She poked her head out of the opening, looking up at me. "Thank you. I'm sorry I snapped at you." 

 "No problem. Stay in there and keep warm. It looks like the storm could be bad." I knelt down in front of her, reaching out and stroking her hair brazenly. "Wouldn't want my favoritest teacher in the world getting wet on my account." 

 "Don't mistreat those girls. They're good kids," she said softly, almost pleading. She didn't pull away from my hand, as I ran my fingers through her hair. 

 "Wouldn't dream of it. We really had a nice talk. I've never had a chance to talk to girls like that, so openly. Not even with my girlfriends. It was good. I learned a lot." 

 She rolled her eyes at me. "That's all we need." She reached up and gave my hand a squeeze. "Thanks for helping, and for keeping your trouble-making to a minimum." She gave me a big grin at the end. 

 "Anything for you," I teased her with a similar grin, inching closer. 

 She sighed. "Go on now, before one of us says or does something stupid." 

 I leaned forward and saw her tremble for a second before my lips reached her forehead. "Goodnight, Shannon." 

 "Goodnight, Alex." She watched me for a second before disappearing back into her tent. 

 I was getting drenched by this time. I ran back to the fire and picked up where we'd been sitting. My mug, canteen and windbreaker were still there. I slid the windbreaker on, pulling the internal hood over my head, and made my way down to the main site. I scattered the logs figuring to let it burn itself out, keeping it going a little longer as a light source if nothing else. I had little fear of it getting out of control with the rain coming. It took about ten minutes but I put away my stuff, and secured the eating area as best I could. 

 I stood outside my tent, in the covered vestibule, stripping off my wet clothing and drying off with the towel I had used at the river that day. By the time I got in the tent, I knew it was going to be a bad one. The wind was whistling through the trees, and it was raining hard. 

 In my tent I organized my stuff, moving everything as far from the entrance as I could. I closed up most of the mesh windows, since it was getting cold. I was worried about the camp. I pulled together an outfit to wear if I had to go back out, including an ugly but utilitarian rain poncho. My clothing was stacked outside of the backpack, leaving all my 'miscellaneous' gear in the pack. I realized I had to take a leak and stood in the vestibule, pissing out the side, when the first loud thunderclap hit. It was like an announcement, and the rain became a pounding wall of water. Shit. 

 Back in my tent, I relaxed in my sleeping bag. Even the massive storm outside couldn't completely distract me from thoughts about what had happened that night. The discussion, the hugging, the kissing, the soft tits encasing my cock. I was hard, recalling it all, stroking myself slowly, wondering what Julie was going to be like. 

 She was mine. I could feel it. And nothing her sister was going to say was going to change that. Damn, she had a tight little body. And it had been months since I'd gotten any. 

 The sudden pounding of hail came as a surprise, pelting my tent. I peeked out the entrance but it was pitch black outside, what little light the fire was producing struggling to reach the inside of my vestibule. I hunted down my flashlight, and was more than a little shocked to see that the batteries were all but dead. Some prepared, huh? At least I had a backup. I found my penlight and looked around. Big hail, some of them the size of a nickel. Crap. We were going to have some very unhappy campers before the night was out. I was certain of that.

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 02 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© ====================== 

 The Camp Savior, and hotel Alex 

 This story could fall under so many categories. Group sex, Mature, First Time, Romance. I'm going with Group sex, although it's more a series of one-on-ones then a full blown orgy. I hope you enjoy the second installment of The Last Boy Scout. 

 I've been holding on to this series for a while, and am releasing it in celebration of my 3000th favorite. Thank you all. 

 ====================== 

 The storm was in full force, rain and occasionally hail pelting the campground. I was warm and dry, but wondered if that would be true for everyone else, if the storm continued for long. 

 I lay back down, closing my eyes and concentrating on images of Julie doing what her sister had done, while wearing less clothing. Much less. Back to stroking my hardness. I needed relief, after the exquisite torture Lisa had subjected me to. 

 Maybe Lisa wouldn't be against us. Hell, maybe she'd even play along. Sisters? How cool would that be? The image in my brain became the two of them, their mouths on my hardness, taking turns pleasuring me. 

 The storm was so loud and noisy, I didn't hear her until she repeated herself. "Alex, can we come in please? Please?" 

 I retrieved my penlight and peered outside. Teri and Heather stood there, soaked to the bone. I grabbed my towels, and unzipped the entrance. "What happened?" I asked, passing the girls both my towels, one still slightly wet. 

 "Our tent collapsed. It's filling with water." 

 "Crap. Dry off, and I'll get you something to wear, OK?" 

 I grabbed two of my t-shirts and held them out to my visitors. "Take everything off, and put these on." 

 Teri took the shirts, shivering. She leaned over, whispering, "You're naked Alex, and putting on quite a show." 

 Whoops. My dick was still hard, and waving in the wind. I ducked back into my tent, searching for my boxers. A little more presentable, I moved the sleeping bag and unfolded the pad underneath, so it would cover more area. I found a garbage bag, and handed it out the door, into the darkness. "Here's a bag. Put your wet stuff in it." 

 "Can we have a flashlight?" Teri asked. 

 Damn. I was supposed to be the prepared outdoorsman. Here I was doing everything wrong. I passed her my penlight, and waited in the dark. A couple of minutes later Teri entered the tent. "We're going to get dressed in here. We would just have gotten the shirts wet outside. Don't look, OK?" 

 I laughed. The darkness was complete. "I wish I could, but it's too damned dark." 

 Heather spoke up for the first time. "Is it OK if I come in too, Alex?" 

 "Of course. Plenty of room." 

 I heard the rustling, and the girls whispering. The light turned on, and they were standing by the entrance. "Where should we go?" Teri asked. 

 They were both shivering uncontrollably. The temperature outside must have dropped 20 degrees in the last hour. "Get in the sleeping bag before you freeze." 

 She handed me the penlight, and I waited until they were in the bag before I went to the doorway. I checked on their wet clothing, moving the bag where it wouldn't blow away or fill up with water, and hung up the towels inside the tent, so they could dry a bit. I zipped the entrance closed, keeping out any stray rain. The vestibule roof was snapping in the wind, but it was doing a decent job of keeping the water out. I flashed the light over the bag, and the girls were at each end, looking back at me nervously. I climbed in between them, reaching out for Teri. "You alright?" I felt her skin and she was chilled to the bone. 

 "Cold," she admitted. 

 I pulled her closer, and she leaned into me, her body and legs icy. "You're warm," she said. 

 I looked over at Heather who was shivering silently. "Come over here and warm up," I told her. She didn't hesitate, moving in close. I wrapped my arm around her, and held them both, until the shivering stopped. 

 Teri rested her head on my chest. She giggled. "He's like a furnace." 

 Heather, nodded. "Thank God. I thought we were going to freeze to death." 

 "I'm going to turn off the light now, save the batteries." I twisted the top and tucked it into the pocket on the side of the tent behind my head. Heather lifted up while I did it, but snuggled into my side as soon as I was done. I'd never have predicted that, not from her, but she was wonderful to hold. 

 We were quiet while I held them, letting them warm up. The only sound was the beating of the rain on the tent, until the silence was broken by Heather's sobs. 

 I gave her a squeeze. "Shh. Everything's cool, Ok? You're warm and safe now." She hugged me tightly, burying her face into my chest. 

 Teri ran her hand down my chest. "I feel like an idiot. I'm so sorry that I didn't believe you about who you'd slept with. I should have trusted you. Should have known better." 

 I felt Heather tense up next to me. I rubbed my hand over her back. "Relax, it's no big deal. Don't worry about it." I said to her. 

 "What did you tell her?" Heather asked eventually, hesitantly. 

 "The truth. As much as I wish otherwise, nothing happened between us that summer." 

 "It was an accident," she said, and I felt her trembling again. 

 "It's OK. Really." I held her tight, still rubbing her back briskly, trying to get her warm. 

 "No it's not. I shouldn't have said it. I was telling someone about my summer wildness, and when they asked who it was, I was too embarrassed to say it was my cousins. You were the first person who came to mind, since you were there. I'm sorry, Alex." 

 "Your cousins? As in plural? Cousins?" Teri asked. 

 "Don't tease her Teri. We've all done things we'd rather not see the light of day." 

 Heather sighed. "No kidding. What a screw up." 

 "All's forgiven," I told her. "Water under the bridge." 

 Teri giggled, and I felt her lips pressed against my chest. "How many girls do you think he's been with, Heather?" 

 "Teri," I warned, smacking her rear loud enough to hear it. "What happened to keeping our talk secret?" 

 "Sorry," she said, leaning into me and throwing her leg over mine. I leaned down and gave her a soft kiss which she returned nicely. 

 "Eight? Ten?" Heather asked, curiosity getting the better of her. 

 "You can tell her, Alex. It's just us. You won't tell, right Heather?" 

 "Hell no. I owe him big time. First for not calling me out when I lied about us, and now for saving my freezing butt." She gave me a squeeze, tucking her head into my neck. "I promise, Alex. I'll be good." 

 "Alex?" Teri pleaded, her hand moving across my stomach, her leg moving back and forth across mine. Heather wasn't behaving any better, her leg draped over mine as well. 

 I surrendered. "You can tell her." 

 "Three," Teri said quickly. 

 "Three? Angela, Maria and who else?" 

 I chuckled. "Since when is my love life so important?" 

 "Since you only date older girls, leaving your classmates wanting," Teri quipped. "What's with that anyway? Aren't we good enough for you?" 

 I gave her a kiss. I kind of liked all this kissing in the dark. I missed the lips as often as not, but a little seeking around did the job. "Haven't you learned anything tonight? You've always been more than good enough for me." 

 Heather snuggled in closer. If that was possible. My hand was stroking her back, all the way down to her back side. I pulled the back of her shirt up a bit, feeling her smooth skin underneath. I was hard as a rock. I knew they were bound to notice soon. 

 "Who else?" Heather asked again. 

 "Kaitlyn Thomas," Teri said. She was kissing my neck and I was having a hard time keeping it together. 

 "Wow. Not Denise?" 

 "Nope, another liar," she said with a fair amount of animosity. "Like Erin. And Naomi." 

 Heather got quiet. "I said I was sorry." 

 "No more sorries, OK? Denise never had a chance anyway. I don't mind you saying we were together. Believe me, given half-a-chance, it would have been true." 

 I felt her moving against me, her hand wandering down my body. "For real?" 

 I reached over, felt for her face, and brought my lips to hers. "Of course. You're pretty amazing, when you're not pretending to be pissed at me for dumping you." 

 Teri giggled. "Would she make your list?" 

 "Solid top 5 last year," I admitted. "One of two from our class." 

 "List?" Heather asked. 

 I jumped a bit when I felt a hand settle over my cock. It took me a couple of seconds to realize it was Teri. I stifled a moan, feeling her grip me. 

 "His favorite girls. The girls he'd date if he could." 

 "Shit. And I kicked myself off your list, huh?" 

 "Temporarily." I kissed her again, a little longer. "I think if everything was cool between us, you'd be back in the running." 

 She giggled. "Don't make me grovel, Alex. As of now, you're my hero." She pressed her lips to my ear, barely whispering. "Let me show you." 

 Teri's hand left my cock, and reached for my head, turning me toward her for a kiss. Things got quiet after that, and I spent several minutes alternating between kissing the cuties lying with me. It was getting more intense, each of the girls practically crawling on me when it was their turn. Hands were moving all over me, commonly landing on my cock, giving me soft squeezes and light strokes. 

 The extra large t-shirts didn't offer a lot of protection. The girls were practically swimming in them. I had access to both of their bare asses under the bottom of their borrowed tees. Quite nice asses, if still a bit cool to the touch. I was bad, pulling up their shirts higher, sliding my hand inside, fondling their soft breasts. I was in heaven 

 Heather was lying fully on top of me, my cock trapped between her closed legs, my hand cupping her butt cheek, while we quietly kissed and learned about each other. A guy could get used to this. 

 "Alex!" I heard Lisa shout from the entrance. 

 Heather slid off of me, and I scrambled out of the sleeping bag, grabbing for my light. 

 I heard Teri whisper "Shit," making me smile. 

 The rain had not let up a bit. I opened the doorway and flashed the light around to find Lisa and Julie standing there, thoroughly waterlogged. The water was pouring off of them. 

 "A stream filled our tent!" Lisa sobbed. 

 They looked even worse off than my first two guests. I passed her the penlight, and the wetter of the two towels. "Strip down, dry off, and then come in. I'll get you something to wear." I stumbled over the girls in the bag, moving to the back of the tent, searching through my stuff. I had one shirt left, and the one I had been wearing which was still wet. The one drying outside couldn't be in good shape. "Crap." 

 "What?" Teri asked. 

 "I'm out of shirts. I only have one left." 

 I felt her moving then she was pressing her shirt into my hand. "I'm warm enough. You can use mine." 

 "Thanks baby. Mine from today will be drier by morning. I'll make sure you're taken care of." 

 "I know." 

 I moved toward the entrance, and had a short glimpse of the naked sisters before they turned off the light and entered the tent. I reached forward and felt a leg. "Here's a couple of shirts. Put 'em on." I was kneeling in front of them, grabbed the nearest towel, and dried the legs in front of me. "Sit down here, and let me get your feet," I told her. 

 The girls struggled into their shirts. "Decent?" I asked. 

 "Ye-e-e-s," I heard Lisa manage through chattering teeth. 

 "Give me the light." 

 She found my hand and pressed the penlight into it. I turned on the light, illuminating the sleeping bag. Heather and Teri were looking back at us. 

 Lisa almost leaped out of the tent. "You're not alone?" 

 "No, their tent collapsed half-an-hour ago." 

 She just stood there shaking. 

 "Jesus, Lisa. Take a seat so I can dry your feet. You too Julie, sit down." 

 Both girls sat down on the sleeping bag. Lisa's legs were trembling badly. I held them in my lap and dried her calves and feet as well as I could. "In the bag with you." I scooted over to Julie and pulled her legs into my lap. The angle of the penlight on the sleeping bag was pointed toward her, and when I looked up, I had a breathtaking view between her legs. If she had any hair there, it was so blonde and fine as to be almost invisible. I dried between her toes, then moved to the second leg. She bent the leg I'd finished with, moving it out of the way, spreading her legs open. Pretty pink slice screaming out to me for attention. Jesus, I was blessed. 

 "Done, get in there and warm-up, Angel." 

 Julie crawled into the bag, and I got a brief view of her bare ass pointed my way before she struggled into the middle of the bag. I looked for my blanket, sitting near the entrance. It was still dry, and 100% wool; it would keep me warm even if it got wet. I wrapped it around my shoulders, sitting by the entrance. 

 "What are you doing?" Teri asked. 

 "I'll be fine. You guys warm up and get some sleep." 

 "No way. There's plenty of room in here for all of us." 

 I smiled. "No there's not. It's a two man bag. Four people is already pushing it." 

 The sisters were huddled together in the middle, shivering. 

 Heather apparently was on Teri's side. "Try. Besides, they'll still freeze to death without our 'furnace' in here." 

 I watched Teri and Heather move to the very outside edges of the bag, and then they were pulling the girls apart, snuggling up to them. "See?" Teri said. 

 I moved to the middle, and with a little effort I was able to wiggle my way in. I pulled each of the sisters close, Lisa on Teri's side, and Julie with Heather toward the front of the tent. They clung to me, their bodies shaking all over, teeth still chattering. Within moments they were sandwiched between our warm bodies, and starting to warm up. 

 Julie was the first to speak. "Everything was fine. It was cold, and the rain was loud, but the tent was holding up. Then all of a sudden it filled up with water, at least three or four inches deep. Everything got soaked." 

 Bad location. I'd tried to warn most of them. No need rubbing it in. "You're safe now. This tent isn't going anywhere, and we're high enough that we shouldn't get any runoff." 

 I was keenly aware of Teri's bare breasts pressed against the arm I was holding Lisa with. 

 Lisa finally spoke. "He is a furnace, isn't he?" 

 Heather giggled. "Told you so." 

 Both of the sisters were leaning over me, clinging to me for warmth. "Lights going out, OK?" 

 "OK," Lisa answered, while Julie nodded. 

 I held them in the dark, my mind going nuts with the crazy situation. Eventually the shivering stopped. "Feeling a little better?" I asked Julie. 

 She kissed my neck. "A lot better." 

 Lisa squeezed me tight. "Me too, thanks." 

 "How was it out there?" 

 "A couple of tents down, but I think there were people still in them. One other tent was full of water, but empty. I don't know where they went." Lisa explained. 

 I heard the zipper on the end of the sleeping bag. "What are you doing, Heather?" 

 "I'm going to open the side, and use your blanket doubled up on the end to give us a little more room." 

 "Make sure you tuck lots of it under the sleeping bag, or you'll be freezing in a while." It wasn't a bad idea. At the moment we were cocooned, with barely room to breathe. 

 "Alright." I heard her moving around, and my arm was no longer trapped against Julie's back. I stroked her softly, and hugged her close. She moved up to kiss me, and I let my hand caress her hip while she did. When I turned toward Lisa, I found her face next to mine, bumping our heads with a giggle before kissing her as well. She climbed on top of me, letting Teri scoot in closer, and freeing up my hand to do a little wandering of its own. 

 "See," she whispered. "Plenty of room." 

 We kissed long and deep, and I felt her hips grinding against my hardness. I loved the feel of her, and could smell a hint of her shampoo in her hair. She was an aggressive kisser, but I wasn't complaining. 

 "Share, sissy," Julie whispered plaintively. 

 With a sigh, she started sliding off of me, and I scooted toward Julie, before she took over her sister's place. I straightened her out on me, and was very aware of her legs opening, and my hard cock pressing against her. Fucking incredible. A few minutes of kissing and bare bottom fondling later, I was a little surprised to hear Teri whisper, "Share?" 

 Julie gave me a last deep kiss, nibbling on my lip, and moved off of me. Teri climbed over Lisa and on top of me. 

 "Are you naked?" Lisa whispered. 

 I thought it was funny everyone was whispering. The storm was still pounding outside, the rain was like drumsticks against the skin of tent. 

 "He ran out of shirts. I gave you guys mine, so you could warm up." 

 No more talk after that. Just more delightful kissing, touching and rubbing. Her bare skin encouraged me to reach for her soft tits, feeling her hard little nipples. Teri's nipples. It was a long time fantasy of mine, and I was wallowing in it. 

 "OK," she mumbled, and I realized someone must have tapped her or something to get her to move. She slid down between Lisa and me, and then Heather was mounting me, dressed only in her birthday suit. 

 I didn't say anything, accepting her generous offer. 

 It was amazing, total silence in the pitch black darkness and girls moving on top of me switching off every couple of minutes. Soft flesh pressing against me. Pillowy tits mashed against my body. Full ass cheeks bared to my touch. It was difficult to keep track of who was who, even more so when they started switching sides. I don't know how long it went on, before I realized they were all naked. Not a shred of clothing anywhere. I felt hands at my waist, pushing my boxers down. It came from my right side, but I had no inkling of who it was. My hands were getting braver, naughtier, exploring between their legs, feeling warm moistness in contrast to their cool skin. 

 The movement was often awkward, knees, elbows and hips bumping against each other, heads butting together, toe nails scraping. I heard the occasional whisper, but never directed to me. I felt they were scheming, but under the decadent avalanche of teen flesh, who was I to complain? 

 During the movement, hands would frequently grasp for my cock, tugging on it, stroking me, squeezing. Fucking incredible. 

 Whoever was on top of me opened her legs and reached for my cock. "Who..." I started to ask, and I was hushed from all sides. Soft lips closed over mine from the side, efficiently quieting me. I felt myself entering a tight warmth and I groaned. 

 She settled over me with exquisite slowness. My arms were pinned down by the young angels parked on each side of me, their taut bodies immobilizing me. The girl kissing me slowed down, her mouth barely covering mine. I could feel her lips turn back in a smile, as I gasped, my cock completely enveloped in velvety moist sweetness. 

 I was balls deep in one of these amazing girls. She rose up to the very limit, and I felt naughty questing fingers searching out where we were joined, a curious fingernail stroking my length in advance of that fantastic feeling pussy descending over me with torturous slowness. Another mouth moved over mine, and I groaned at the sensory overload while two tongues, side by side, explored my mouth. 

 The girls kissing me pulled back, and the new love of my life gave my cock one long stroke inside of her before lowering herself to my body and delivering a sweet kiss which I welcomed. The teasing hands were still roaming around our lower connection, adding an unimaginably magical sensation to this perfect moment. 

 My new lover settled into an exquisite rhythm, riding my full length with a slow inexorable motion. She eased back and forth for only a minute or so, and moved off before it got to be too much. When she pulled off of me I wanted to cry. It was a good thing my arms were trapped beneath the girls at my side, or I would have grabbed her and pulled her back onto my cock until I achieved my desperately needed release.

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 02 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© My next companion wasn't as prone to surrender everything, content to grind against me, her body writhing against mine. My hands were freed, allowing me to fondle her to my heart's content, and I breathed a sigh of relief, my need to come momentarily ameliorated. She gave me a last long kiss and moved away. 

 Another body eased onto me, and I groaned in feverish anticipation when her legs embraced me, an invisible hand holding my cock steady, poised to enter another teen hottie. My hands moved up to her thighs, but they were pulled back to the sides and encouraged to take up residence between the thighs of my soft bookends. Sliding my fingers inside of my special friends, my cock slowly penetrated another tight young pussy, teasing hands still joining that molten slot on my cock. 

 The cloud of sexual ecstasy faded from my brain long enough for me to wonder who was fucking me. Two girls now. My guess was Heather and Lisa were the suddenly generous ones. Teri I knew was saving it, and I suspected Julie was still a virgin. This girl knew what she was doing, her upper body remaining pretty still while her hips gave me a hell of a working over, slamming down onto my stiffness over and over again. She rose up on her hands, and the girl to my left moved in for a hot as hell kiss. 

 I pulled away. "Stop," I moaned softly. 

 All I got was a chorus of hushes. Abruptly I was unsheathed and my silent rider was inside the bag, her mouth finishing me off. The feel of her tongue bathing me was beyond description, the current situation only making it more intense. I moaned, as I filled her anonymous mouth, exploding harder than I ever had in my life, cumming continuously. 

 "God! Oh, God, oh GOD!" was my groaned prayer of thanks. 

 I finished in that incredible mysterious mouth, my heart hammering in my chest, barely able to breathe. I was treated to lots of attention from the girls on each side of me, while that warm wondrous mouth restored me to hardness. It didn't take long, with the thought of getting inside one of those tight little pussies again. Sweet Jesus, I was getting fucked by the school's hottest girls! I wanted this perfect storm to never end. 

 I felt my dear cock tender move away, and the body on my left moved on top of me. It was strange. I was thinking less of them as individuals, and more as soft tender bodies, delivered to me for my pleasure. Another kisser, she closed her legs holding me tight, while I thrust up between them. One of my more intimate girls replaced her, sliding onto me easily. I was tired of being passive. I tore my hands free, reached for her hips, raising her up, and started thrusting into her, looking for a rhythm I could sustain. She lowered her chest to mine, soft tits pressed against my chest, tilted her hips upward and I found the feeling I was looking for. I started hammering away forcefully, firm ass gripped tightly in my hands while I pounded upward. They had driven the action so far, but I was starting to take over, holding this girl's hips high as I fucked her into submission. 

 I probably could have worked out who was who, but it was certainly more fun and exciting this way. I didn't know. I didn't care. 

 Her moans accelerated, and I felt her tremble. "Come for me," I whispered into her ear, straining at the intense pace. She gasped, "Oh, God!" and dug her fingernails into my skin, coming hard. I held her firmly, long stroking her while she caught her breath. More hands joined mine, caressing her, touching her softly. 

 When she moved away I eagerly drew my next girl on top of me. She spread her legs for me, and I was determined to make my other lover come like the last. Let the two virtuous girls see what it was like. I felt her hand guiding me home. I was going to fuck her senseless. 

 Lips were pressed against my ear from the side. "Gentle," she breathed softly. "Please." 

 Gentle? Oh God. Was it possible? 

 I felt the girl move slowly, awkwardly, my cock turning to granite at the possible prospect of being her first. She whimpered softly, then I felt the tip enter her. She stopped, laying against my chest for a few moments, and I caressed her, gently, warmly. She rose up and pushed down slowly. I felt the pressure increase, her tightness impenetrable. I held her smooth, tight ass cheeks in my hands and with a hard thrust on my end, I was abruptly inside of her. She cried out softly, her hands gripping me tightly, nails piercing my flesh, an echo of my own piercing. I was achingly aware of everything about her, the moment so clarifying, unimaginably intense. I immediately discerned it was young Julie skewered on my cock, much smaller than the others, her head didn't even reach my chin when I was fully buried inside of her. The large soft tits pressed against my skin only confirmed my guess. 

 I leaned down and kissed the top of her head, my hands softly stroking her back. She started moving on me, and I slid in and out of her, short, gentle strokes, not probing her too deeply, yet still wringing breathy moans and whimpers out of her. I reached down and held her perfect little butt in my hands while I used more of my length on her. She trembled, letting me fuck her tenderly before she pushed back against me, stopping me. She inched forward, pulling off my cock and kissed me heatedly. I held her carefully, wrapping my arms around her, kissing her as warmly as possible, doing my best to let her know how much I appreciated her gift. 

 I felt a hand around my cock after she got off, a cloth wiping me down, before my next rider climbed aboard. I alternated fucking Lisa and Heather, and groping Teri, for several more rides, each of them getting a little wilder and more intense. The sleeping bag was shifting downward, the cool air on our skin, making their pert little nipples harden under my touch. The time spent actually fucking was growing longer, sweeter, allowing me more time to enjoy each girl. The pauses between the girls, and the interludes with Teri allowed me to extend my stamina, taking the edge off. 

 The rain was starting to abate a bit, steady, but not the torrent of earlier. Things were quieter, and the air warmed from the proximity of our bodies, and our energetic calisthenics. The room was growing almost comfortable. 

 When Julie finally took her turn again, I knew instantly it was her. The young sexpot settled onto my cock, slow and careful, tenderly taking me home. I tried to be gentle with her, unlike my performances with Lisa and Heather, who I speared with great abandon. I enjoyed the sweet ride, calming a little after my last aggressive pounding. Julie started moving with me, responding, her movements more accommodating and less enduring. I swear at one point she purred for me. She was exciting me to no end, and it was only with the greatest effort that I didn't take her more forcefully. I loved her gently, easily, until she was comfortable with me, momentarily sated, and drew away, with a lingering kiss. 

 Our tent was becoming a haven of mind-numbing sexuality. I was getting a little crazy, playing with mysterious tits, screwing anonymous pussies, fondling perfect tight bodies, and kissing generous lips. I didn't ask permission, or even check their preferences. I did what I wanted with whatever I could get my hands on. And I loved it. 

 After Julie, my next rider sat upright and fucked me hard, riding me like she was born to it. A natural cowgirl. I reached up and gripped her tits, playing with them, teasing her nipples, all in the pitch black, all by feel. Another epiphany. Big tits. Lisa was riding me like she was born to it. Working in the dark so much seemed to heighten my sensations, particularly touch. It was too much, and I had to warn her. "I'm close," I moaned softly. 

 Whoever was beside me moved downward, and as soon as my cowgirl dismounted, a mouth settled over me, working devotedly, taking only a minute or so to drain me again. I groaned when I felt another mouth join hers, and the two of them proceeded diligently to restore the iron to my rod, and keep the games going. While they did their part my face was enveloped in 2 sets of full, amazing, absolutely glorious tits. 

 Only two girls I knew had tits like these. The fabulous Samuelson sisters. Big, full and soft, and remarkably similar. And now I knew they were topped with the sweetest, firmest, tastiest nipples which responded to my attention in the most amazing way. I was struck with the thought that with the fabulous sisters up here, virgin Teri was one of those working on me down below. She might be saving 'it' for marriage, but she clearly wasn't saving everything. I'd have to thank her. 

 That little interlude gave me a chance to sort everything out, whether I wanted to or not. Lisa on my left feeding her nipple into my mouth, newly deflowered Julie on my right clinging to me as if her life depended on it. On my left, below, was my sweet rider, Heather, who could fuck like a minx. I think I owed her cousins a debt of gratitude. Meaning the sweet mouth going down on me was none other than my darling Teri. 

 As fun as the mystery play had been, knowing who was who, plus the knowledge it was the puritan Teri whose mouth was caring for me so delightfully, had the steel surging into my shaft. Ready for Act III. 

 What I wasn't ready for was the sisters moving apart so that Teri could claim top spot. The sleeping bag had been pushed down to my knees and she was straddling my hips, hers raised to grant me that most intimate access. 

 I couldn't stay quiet. "Are you sure?" 

 Lisa pressed her sweet lips to mine. "Shh." 

 Julie breathed into my ear, "It has to be you, Alex." 

 I found myself trembling in anticipation. I'd fantasize about having Teri more than anyone ever. Not because I found her so much more desirable than any of the other girls, but because I'd wanted her for so long, since I first got an erection. One of my longest running fantasies finally on the verge of coming true. 

 Suddenly I hated being in the dark. I wanted to see this. I wanted to see her pretty naked body settling over my cock. I desperately wanted to watch Teri's cute little tits bouncing with wild abandon while she fucked me into sweet oblivion. 

 I could feel Teri moving over my cock. It was pressed against my belly, while her moist pussy slid back and forth over it. Her hands pressed down against my chest, and she lifted up, ready for me. 

 A flashlight beam played across the inside of the tent, illuminating Teri in her resplendent nudity, poised above me, if only briefly. 

 "Alex? I need your help." 

 The sound of Miss Shannon's voice had the girls scrambling under the covers, and I was run over by sweet soft flesh in their mad scurry. "I'm coming," I announced loudly, grabbing for the penlight. 

 "I'm turning on the flashlight," I announced quietly, and with its narrow beam I searched through my clothes pile for shorts to wear. It took a few more moments to slip them on, and I barely made it before the zippered front opened and Miss Shannon poked her head in. 

 "Are you decent?" she asked. 

 I scrambled for the entrance, heedless of the squirming bodies underneath me. At the last moment I leaned over to Lisa, closest to the door, and gave her the penlight. 

 Miss Shannon shined her light in, running it over me. "Are you alright, Alex?" 

 "I'm fine," I assured her, moving forward until she backed out. I climbed out after her. There was enough light for me to see she was soaked. "How are you? You look pretty miserable." 

 She gave me a tired smile. "It's been a rough night." 

 "What can I do?" I asked. 

 "First, you can tell me what's going on in that tent." 

 "Nothing's going on." Which was technically true, now that I had left. "But it's pretty full. Teri and Heather came first, when their tent collapsed. Then an hour or so ago, Lisa and Julie showed up when theirs flooded. Soaked to the skin and chilled to the bone." 

 "I thought I saw a lot of bare flesh in there," she said with a raised eyebrow. 

 I pointed out the plastic bag. "Their wet clothes. I gave them the three dry shirts I had, but I was one short. Teri's wearing nothing but my boxers. But she's as pure as can be, and besides, I've known her since we were kids, and seen her naked more than once. Anyway, she has the least to cover up on top. She seemed the safest bet." 

 "I guess that's why you're barely dressed," she observed, looking me over. 

 "And getting cold out here. What can I do for you?" 

 "The camp's a mess. Half the tents are down and flooded. I was hoping we could put some people in here but it looks like you're nearly full up. Can you help us put together some kind of shelter?" 

 The rain was still falling, but the front had clearly passed. Hard to tell how much longer it would come down. The wind was almost non-existent, and I hadn't heard thunder in hours. "I figure we can do something half-decent now that the wind has died down." 

 "How can I help?" she asked. 

 "How's your tent doing?" 

 "Not so good. I wasn't high enough to avoid the flooding either." 

 I took the flashlight from her and she gave it up readily. I ran it over her, and saw my first guess was right. She was soaked, chilled, and half dead on her feet. "Get dried off and warmed up before you catch pneumonia. I'm going to find John and set up a shelter and fire for anybody who needs it. You get inside with the others, before you pass out." 

 "I can't do that," she said. "I'm responsible for everyone." 

 "Where's Dr. Reed?" 

 She looked like she wanted to spit. "More useless than tits on a bull. He's still in his tent, won't let anybody in. I'm not so certain he's alone, either." 

 "Ellen?" 

 "That would be my guess. Stupid asshole." 

 I moved forward, and took her in my arms, holding her. "You're freezing Shannon. I'll take care of things from here. Dry off, warm up, and try to get a little sleep. I'll let you know when things are taken care of." 

 "You sure about this?" 

 "Positive." I moved over to the tent entrance. "Miss Shannon's coming in. Find her a pair of my boxers, and Heather, you let her wear your shirt." 

 I turned back to her. "I'm going to borrow your flashlight, if you don't mind. Take off those wet things and dry off the best you can out here. There's a towel by the door you can finish the job with once you get inside. If you're shy, they'll turn off the flashlight until you're clothed." 

 She nodded. "Why have Heather give me her shirt?" 

 I chuckled. "Truth be told, if I were to come back later and see either you or one of those sisters topless, I'm not sure I could be responsible for my actions. Heather? Heather and I have issues." 

 She chuckled. "You are one cocky little son of a bitch, aren't you?" 

 I took her in my arms again. "Go on. You've earned it." I took the biggest chance I had in my short life, and raised her chin, giving her a soft lingering kiss on her lips. "You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for my favorite teacher, Shannon. Let me take care of this for you." 

 She pulled me down and kissed me back, brief but firm. "Thanks, Alex. I knew I could count on you." 

 I gave her a squeeze. "Always." 

 The air was cool, but not horribly so. Walking around shirtless wasn't that bad. A hat kept the water out of my eyes as I surveyed the camp devastation. It was ruined. "John, you out here?" I called out. 

 I heard him answer from over by the meal area. "Alex, that you?" 

 "Yeah." I wandered his way, and saw a pretty miserable looking crowd huddled under the table, a tarp above them, trying to stay warm. It was a mixed crowd, and John was holding Dominique in his arms. Lucky bastard. It might prove hard to get him out of there. 

 "You look like shit," he observed, grinning. 

 "Feel like it, too. I need your help, we gotta do better than this," I nodded toward his makeshift setup. 

 "Why's it always gotta be my help?" he griped, with a nod toward the lovely Dominique huddled in his arms. 

 "'Cause I hate you, especially right now." 

 He grinned, leaned down and gave Dominique a kiss on the cheek. He peeled off his jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders. He climbed out from underneath his haven, peeling off this shirt. Fucker had pecs like slabs of concrete and some serious abs. "I love you too. You say the sweetest things." 

 "Let's go, Dickweed." 

 He laughed, following me back to my area. "That's Mr. Big Dickweed to you." 

 When we'd put a little distance between ourselves and the meal area, I had to bust his chops. "Dominique? Really? How the fuck does a limp-dick cocksucker like you rate someone like that?" 

 "Ill wind that blows no good. She was in need, and I was there. Jealous much?" 

 I didn't mention what was in my tent at that moment, or what we'd been up to. "Hell yeah. Jealous as shit. God, for a moment there I had a suicidal urge to jump in and fight you for her. You think it'll stick?" 

 "You gonna interfere?" he asked cautiously. He was well aware of my interest in her. At least before tonight. 

 "With you? No. Any other fuckwad around here, I'd have to kick their ass just to make a point." 

 He laughed, bumping up against me as we got to my tent area. "You know I didn't intend anything right? It just happened, and how the hell was I going to turn away an opportunity like that?" 

 "You'd be an idiot if you did. And I know you're no idiot, all kidding aside. I really would have had to kick your ass if you fumbled an opportunity like that one. I hope it outlasts the weekend." 

 "Thanks. Anyway, seemed you were doing pretty well with the big titty blonde sisters." 

 "Yeah. No complaints." I wondered if they could hear us, we were only twenty or so feet from the tent, but I knew the rain on the tent made it almost impossible to hear anything outside. Hell, I couldn't hear someone yelling from the entrance. 

 "I want to set up this fly for a shelter. I've got another tarp I can put underneath. Build up the fire in front of it and add to the back wall to reflect the heat in. It should be able to hold most of the homeless." 

 "Sounds like a plan." 

 Easier said than done. The ropes were still in place from earlier, but I wanted to stake it down better, build up some sides, enhance the fire pit, and do it all quickly. With the roof in place, I sent him to get more wood from the stack near the central fire, the bottom of which was now under water. While he was away, I returned to my tent. 

 "It's me," I said softly in case anybody was sleeping. "Anyone up?" 

 "Just a sec," Teri replied, showing up in the doorway. 

 "How's it going?" 

 "Good. Everyone's napping. For some reason most of us are kind of tired." 

 I leaned forward, kissing her lips. "I hated leaving when I did. You have no idea how much I hated it," I told her in hushed tones. 

 She grinned, opening up the fly enough that I could see she was still naked. "I have a fair idea." 

 "God, you're killing me." 

 "Did you come here to ogle me?" 

 I looked her over, imagining that sweet little body of hers underneath me. Or on top of me. Maybe both. 

 "Alex?" 

 I looked up to her face. She was smirking. "You are bad." 

 "I know. In the bottom of my backpack are some plastic tarps. Can you get them for me? And the cord of rope with them." 

 "Sure." I held my flashlight on her as she turned away, watching her pretty little butt, and that glorious space between her legs. Shit, that was almost mine. 

 She returned a minute or so later. "Here. Anything else?" 

 "No, I'll be back a little later. Still have a ton to do." 

 "You know you have a near naked teacher in your sleeping bag. She wouldn't take Heather's shirt." 

 "Fuck. Why would you do that to me?" 

 She giggled. "I bet you'll get back here quicker." 

 "Hardly. Nothing could get me over here faster than knowing you're waiting, dressed like this." 

 She gave me a quirky little smile. "You know, I would have called bullshit normally, but I'm changing my ways. I'm going to try to trust you more, and believe it when you say nice things, no matter how improbable." Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 02 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© I gave her a soft kiss. "Six years of being around you. It's a miracle I ever go soft." 

 She reached out and gave me a push. "I'm trying, Buddy. I'm really trying. So cut the hyperbole, finish up and come back to me." 

 I returned to the work-site with my cock straining my shorts. 

 I'd guess it took the better part of an hour before we had the shelter ready for its new guests. While John took care of getting them relocated without getting too wet, I stopped by Dr. Reed's tent. It was set back from most of the others, but in direct view of our new setup. Which could cause some trouble. 

 I knelt in front of the tent. It looked like it had held up well. I gave it a firm shake. "Dr. Reed. You up?" 

 He sounded logy when he responded a moment later. "Who is it?" 

 "It's Alex. Alex Hamilton. I don't want to interfere, but I thought you should know. In a few minutes about 10 people are going to be setting up shelter not 20 feet from here. From that moment on, you're not going to have a bit of privacy. If there's anyone with you, now would be a good time to fix that, while nobody's the wiser." 

 "What are you intimating?" 

 "I'm not intimating anything. With all the wind and rain, we're all taking shelter where we can. There's five people in my tent right now. If I had been near your tent, I would have made for it. But appearances matter. We have a nice warm shelter setup for anybody who needs it." 

 "Who's there with you?" he asked. 

 "Nobody. I swear, I won't be speaking of anything that goes on tonight. It's certainly extreme circumstances. But if we could avoid any serious rumor mongering, it would probably be for the best. You've only got a couple of minutes before any chance of avoiding observation is gone for good." 

 There was some whispering and rustling, and a minute later the fly opened and Ellen climbed out, holding a jacket over her head. "I, uh, just got here. My tent was leaking." 

 "I know. Let's go." I put my arm around her, and brought her to our shelter. "I brought you here from your tent, just now. Got it?" 

 She nodded, looking thoroughly embarrassed. "Got it. Thanks, Alex." 

 I leaned nearer, "Your shirt's on backward and inside out. You might want to take care of that." The girl had the biggest tits in the free world. Everyone would be looking at that chest, and couldn't miss the dressing faux pas. I stood in front of her, holding her jacket blocking the view from the rest of the camp while she rearranged things. I'm ashamed to say I'm not enough of a gentleman to avoid taking a peak. Her tits were mammoth, far larger than any I'd ever seen. It was amazing she could walk upright. 

 She caught me peeking, and blushed. 

 "Sorry," I whispered. "I couldn't help myself. You have the most amazing body, beautiful." She pulled her shirt down, and I slipped her jacket around her shoulders. She turned and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "Thanks for taking care of me. That would have been bad." 

 "I'm not one to lecture," I told her, brushing her hair back and letting my hand stroke her cheek. "But you can do better." I left her, and she walked over in front of the raging fire, extending her hands toward it. 

 While John got everyone transferred, I started on my next task. Why was I such a friggin' Boy Scout? I started checking out the tents that were underwater, moving all their contents near the new shelter. I had a second tarp setup as a cover, with a couple of clotheslines underneath it. We could dry off clothing, and even sleeping bags there. I'd let the owners deal with their own belongings. The tents I unstaked and dragged to higher ground, with help arriving halfway through. John and a new recruit, Max, who looked young but seemed to be holding up better than most. They helped with moving the four worst tents. We spent another 20 minutes re-erecting the tents that had collapsed, which weren't under water. 

 We checked on our relocated survivors. They seemed in a lot better frame of mind. It had taken some doing, but I had a nice fire blazing, and most of the wood from our original pile was still dry. It made a nice side wall to the shelter, and the tarp that had been covering it served a similar purpose. 

 The inside of the shelter was warm, throughout, and they were chatting away. Clothes were drying under the side tarp, and it was almost a party atmosphere. I turned to John. 

 "You got it from here?" 

 "Sure." 

 "Good, 'cause Dominique's looking lonely. You should try to get some of the sleeping bags opened up and dried out. You can make a nice community sleeping area. Could be fun." 

 "I got it, Alex. What are you going to do?" 

 "Couple of last tasks, and I'll see if the gang that's taken over my tent will let me in. Wish me luck." 

 Before settling down, I stopped by all the remaining upright tents, waking any sleeping occupants and letting them know there was a shelter set up if they wanted, or needed. My last stop, against my better judgment was Dr. Reed's. 

 "Dr. Reed? Alex again." 

 He must not have been asleep, he answered quickly enough, actually opening the front and peering out. 

 "Everything's fine now. If you wanted to go up to the shelter and check on everyone, it might be good, letting them know you're in charge and all. You've got about a dozen people up there, girls and guys. If your sleeping bag is dry and you could spare it, you'd be a hero." 

 "Would a blanket help?" 

 "Anything would be better than sitting and laying on bare tarps." 

 He stared at me for a moment. "What are you up to?" 

 He was frying my last nerve. "I'm trying to keep people out of trouble, including stupid little girls who don't need any more rumors around them than they already have. I'm trying to make it a little more comfortable for this crowd on a rough night. I don't want anybody getting into any trouble we can avoid." I calmed down. "Miss Shannon's been dealing with everything until now, but she's wiped out, and soaked to the skin. The worst is over. Everything should be good until morning. You need to take over now." 

 He looked like he wanted to say something, but seemed to think better of it. "Alright. I'll do what I can. What are you going to do?" 

 "Me?" I laughed. "I'm freezing, soaked, and haven't slept. I've been working my ass off while everyone else was either feeling sorry for themselves or waiting for someone else to do the heavy lifting. I'm going to see if I can't get a couple hours of shut-eye, if that's alright by you." 

 He held his hands up, waving them awkwardly. "No offense, Alex. Really. I was only curious. I appreciate what you've done tonight. Everything you've done," he said softly, emphasizing the 'Everything'. "You get some sleep. I'll take over." 

 I nodded. "Thanks." I started to turn away, but turned back at the last moment. "Listen, Dr. Reed. They like you. But they're cold and exhausted. You could really make a difference here. Find a way for them to get a little sleep, don't fuss about 'guy' areas and 'girl' areas. Let them get their comfort from each other, and I swear you're golden." 

 He nodded. "I'll take that under advisement. I do appreciate your effort." 

 "Sure." 

 I passed by the shelter, standing in the front, letting the fire burn off the worst of the chill. Everyone was settling in nicely. I almost felt bad about dragging a chaperon up there, I counted five guys and seven girls, and they were obviously in a happier state of mind. I caught John's eye, where he was reclining with Dominique in his arms, and gave him a thumbs up. He responded by giving me a wink and planting a lip-lock on his new girl. I wanted to be just a little angry with him, but hell, he'd earned it. I had a new list now, anyway. 

 Back at my tent I dried off the best I could, shedding my soaked shorts, looking forward to the warmth of the sleeping bag and soft bodies. I opened the fly a bit. "Cold, tired, naked man coming in," I warned them. 

 Inside the door I grabbed the 'finishing' towel and did the best I could. I covered my flashlight with my hand, only letting a hint of light through to see if there was any chance of finding a place to lay. Miss Shannon was nearest the door, mostly in the blanket. Next to her were the sisters, followed by Heather with Teri on the end. They looked to be sleeping, but Lisa popped her head up, putting her fingers to her lips. She gestured for me to join them between her and Julie. 

 Sounded like a decent enough plan to me. 

 I watched her nudge her sister awake, and they moved apart, turning on their sides. I slipped between them, my teeth chattering and I was shivering hard. I must have been colder than I'd thought. The inside of the tent wasn't too bad, but the warm sleeping bag felt heavenly. 

 There wasn't enough room for me, but Julie solved that problem by propping herself up so I could slide underneath her. She settled on to me, shivering. "You're frozen!" she whispered. I responded by giving her a small kiss and extinguishing the flashlight, letting the darkness back in. 

 I held her while Lisa snuggled in close. "Everything OK?" she whispered. 

 I nodded, then realized she couldn't see it. "F-f-fine," I managed to say through my chattering teeth. 

 She kissed my shoulder. "Mmm. Good," she murmured sleepily. 

 I felt movement from my opposite side. "Alex?" Miss Shannon asked sleepily. 

 "P-p-present." 

 She moved nearer, reaching out for me. "God, you're an ice cube!" 

 "M-m-melting a l-little," I told her. 

 She moved against me, and I heard her chuckle. "Julie? Is that an appropriate position?" she whispered. 

 "He's freezing! And he wouldn't fit in here with us otherwise." She was very firm in her reply. I imagined if Miss Shannon tried to get her to move, she'd have a fight on her hands. 

 She did feel great on me. I really was starting to warm up a bit. 

 "I think we can let this one slide. I imagine the camp savior deserves a hero's welcome." 

 That got a giggle out of my diminutive human blanket. 

 Shannon was pressing against my side, and I recalled that she was topless, at least according to Teri's last report. A real Hero's welcome. 

 "How'd it go?" she whispered into my ear. Her breath against my neck had my hormones kicking into overdrive. 

 I turned my head toward her, bumping foreheads. "Ow," she said teasingly. I could feel her breath on my face when she said it. 

 "Sorry. All done. Shelter, fire, and clothes hung up and drying. A baker's dozen under the new tarp." 

 She wiggled against me and I moved my arm around her, pulling her close. "You're warm," I said. 

 "Mmm. Thanks to you." 

 Julie eased to the opposite side a bit, still lying on me but straddling my left leg. I scooted toward Shannon. She turned on her side, leaning against me, one leg sliding over mine, her bare breast pressed against my chest. 

 "Anything else I need to know? Do I need to go out there?" she asked with dread in her voice. 

 I lowered my voice to the faintest whisper. "No. Dr. Reed's tent is empty now, and he's going to take over." 

 She pressed her lips to my ear. "Ellen?" she asked so faintly I could barely hear it. 

 "Personally escorted to the shelter, away from prying eyes." 

 "Fucking ass," she mumbled. 

 Julie was up to no good, and had her hand wedged between us, rubbing life back into my frozen cock. It was turning out to be quite effective. I reached down and gave her ass a squeeze. Still bare, and still delightful to touch. 

 "Everything copacetic here?" I asked. 

 Shannon giggled. "Oh yes, we had a delightful discussion." She whispered again, "Naughty, naughty boy." 

 It was too much. I leaned down and kissed her, and was delighted when she returned it in full force. 

 Julie giggled. "Mmm. He liked whatever you just did." 

 I'd behaved until then, but that kiss put me over the edge. I slid my hand down her back, caressing her warm skin, and slid it inside her loose shorts, or I should say my loose shorts, giving her round butt a nice grope. 

 If I expected any kind of recrimination, I'd be waiting a long time. I had a hand full of her ass cheek, massaging it, while our kiss grew more intense. I felt a leg tussle going on below, and Julie's won out, sliding between Shannon and I. God, that girl was brazen. 

 She had me fully hard, and was trying to get me inside her. It took a few seconds before she could claim success. I moaned into Shannon's delightful mouth. 

 Our sexy chaperon pulled away. "Is she?" 

 "MmHmm," I acknowledged, pushing into my unofficial girlfriend. "How much did they tell you? I asked. 

 She nibbled on my shoulder. "Everything, I think. Your little friend Teri is quite the chatterbox." She giggled while Julie fucked me gently. "I mean, hell Alex, it was hard to hide it. Four practically naked girls in a tent that reeked of sex. Any doubts I might have had are pretty much quashed now." 

 "Angry?" I asked her. 

 She pressed her lips to mine. "What do you think?" 

 "I think I've died and gone to Heaven." 

 She nibbled on my ear. "I think 'Heaven' is currently fucking you." 

 "Hell, yeah," I chuckled. 

 "All of them?" she asked while Julie maintained her sweet rocking motion. 

 "All but little oral Teri," I teased. "I should be mad at you for that one. I was moments away from corrupting her completely when you showed up." 

 "Poor baby. How can I make it up to you?" 

 I moved my hand down her ass crack, pressing a finger against her moist pussy, easing it in. 

 "Here? Now? With all these girls around?" 

 "Trade places with Julie." 

 "Alex. I can't. Not like this." 

 I caressed Julie's hair, getting her attention. She was totally fixated on servicing me. "Julie, trade places with Shannon." 

 She slid off of me, and started crawling over our teacher. I tugged Shannon onto me, "You have to now, there's not enough room otherwise." 

 She moved over me slowly, and I felt her hands slide her shorts off. "God, you're terrible," she whispered to me. 

 I held her in my arms, kissing her deeply. When she came up for air, she reached between us, and eased my cock into her warm hole. I sighed as she slid me into her welcoming pussy, taking her time, until she was grinding for more. "Is that what you wanted?" 

 "For damn near forever." I held her ass in my hands and thrust into her hard, getting a sweet little whimper in return. 

 "Gentle, baby. That's a lot to get used to." 

 Julie snuggled up to me. "It wasn't just me then? I didn't think it would even fit." 

 "No sweetie. It's not just you. That's a lot to take care of. He didn't hurt you did he?" 

 "No way. It was perfect. I mean, it hurt at first, and for a while I didn't think it was even going to be possible. It took some getting used to, but I really like it." 

 "You don't mind sharing with me?" 

 She giggled. "Nothing behind my back he wouldn't do in front of me." 

 Shannon was rolling her hips, teasing me. I reached down and held her hips, pushing deep. 

 I looked over to the other side, wondering about Lisa's attention, but she seemed to be sleeping again. Incredible. 

 "Isn't it nice?" Julie asked. 

 Shannon moaned softly. "Wonderful." 

 "OK, now here's the rules," Julie whispered. "We all share, just a few minutes each. And we all stay totally quiet. Nobody should know who's doing what, except the people involved. Everything is totally private. What happens between him and any one of us, is our own little secret. Like I don't know what you guys are doing right now, not for sure, and you don't know that I was doing the same to him just a minute ago, until he got greedy," she giggled. 

 Shannon raised her hips for me, so I could thrust into her harder. "Who's idea?" she gasped sweetly. 

 "At first it just sort of happened that way. Then Lisa made it a rule. It's pretty wild." 

 "I bet." 

 "Oh yeah, and when he has to come, we finish with our mouths so we don't make a mess." 

 "Have you done that?" 

 "Miss Shannon! Did you already forget the secret part?" I felt little Julie rise up and caress our teacher. "Nobody is supposed to know who does it, or that I haven't yet, but I will finally get a chance to when he finishes with us, if nobody else wakes up." 

 Shannon's motions slowed, and with a press of her hand against my hip, she managed to get me to pause. She turned toward Julie, accepting our teen's gentle touch, and bringing her down for a gentle kiss. "I guess we should be quiet then, so we don't wake anyone." 

 "Yeah. More for us," Julie giggled. 

 "Thanks for sharing him with me, Julie." 

 "You're his favorite. We all know that," Julie whispered. "Now hush up." 

 I fucked her in perfect silence, the patter of the rain our only accompaniment. Julie let us have a nice long time together, before they switched off. I tugged at Shannon, moving her higher until I could reach her breasts with my mouth. Once she understood what I was looking for she was very accommodating, leaning over me while I sucked on those fantasy tits. Shannon could give Julie a run for her money. 

 Julie removed her shirt, leaving the three of us naked; no complaints from me. Once they had the process down, they made sure to keep me isolated at the end of the sleeping bag, with the girl 'on deck' between us and the rest of them. They must have switched places 4 or 5 times before I got the first really nice reaction from either. 

 Shannon was on top and I was pounding her very hard and fast. "There, right there," she whispered, before Julie could shush her. I gave her a steady dose of hammering, and felt her tense up. She surprised me by biting down on my shoulder, while she came for me, fucking back at me with a vengeance. The bite didn't hurt too bad, and I brought her down gently, long slow strokes, testing her depths. 

 Julie hadn't come for me yet, and I dearly wanted to change that. When Shannon started to get off of me, I turned on my side and pulled Julie underneath. I let her guide me into her, and took her firmly. I pumped her with long, firm strokes, my mouth on hers, kissing her the entire time. I felt Shannon's hands between us, caressing us. She concentrated on Julie's breasts a while, then reached down between the teen's legs. At the first touch, Julie whimpered sweetly. I picked up the pace a bit, and Shannon matched my pace. Julie gasped, "Oh God, that's good," and I shushed her, covering her mouth with mine. Her breath was heaving, and I felt her body tensing, her hips pushing back harder. I whispered in her ear, "Come for me Angel, I'm dying to feel you come on my cock." 

 She squealed, the noise muffled by my mouth on hers, and bit down on my lip. It hurt but I refused to be distracted, holding her by her shoulders and slamming into her. She felt wonderful, and I slowed the stroking, keeping it long and deep. She was gasping for breath, before crying out again, a second orgasm quickly following the first. I kept pumping, wanting to see if that was an accident. She came for me three more times in quick succession, until she struggled underneath me. "No more," she gasped, before arching her back and coming harder than ever. 

 I was going to enjoy fucking this one. 

 I eased her down, slowing before coming to a rest deep inside of her. "Don't move, please," she whispered, trembling uncontrollably. 

 Shannon's hand had retreated sometime during our little escapade. I don't know when, but I'm certain it was a big part in getting Julie over the hump for that first one. 

 I nudged my cock into her and felt her body spasm. God she was sweet. I pulled out just a little then diddled her with short little strokes. She whimpered and came again, wriggling underneath me, while I pinned her to the floor. "Too much," she pleaded. 

 Shannon put her hand on my shoulder, "My turn?" 

 I moved over on top of her, her legs open in invitation. I felt incredible, strong and fierce, my cock a steel rod. We were outside the end of the sleeping bag, the blanket underneath us, but open. Shannon guided me into her, then pulled her legs back. I leaned over her, slipping my arms around her legs, pinning them down, and started up where I'd left off, with some short teasing strokes that became longer and longer, until I was pounding into her as hard as I could. She slowly climbed her own peak, until I got her off as well. She was able to contain it better. "Come for me, Alex, please. Come inside me," she whispered. Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 02 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© A hell of an invitation. One I couldn't turn down. I found the motion and angle that allowed me to build my own need, holding back as long as I could, until I had to finish. I groaned, pushing deep and erupting inside of her. I continued with a dozen or so deep thrusts, filling her with my juice. 

 Exhaustion hammered me down immediately, my legs trembling with fatigue. I rolled with her, pulling her over on top of me, leaning against Julie's semi- conscious form. With an enormous effort, I straightened out the blanket, covering us. I stayed inside of Shannon, nudging her with my cock, fondling her tremendous ass, trying to keep hard, never wanting to pull out of her. It was working at least a little, as I stayed thick, buried inside of her. 

 "God, Shannon. You are amazing," I whispered, closing my eyes and holding her. 

 "Mmmm, you were pretty awesome yourself, Mr. Hamilton." I felt her weight settle down on me, her breasts billowing out to the side. 

 I'd push into her every few seconds, maintaining my hardness. I'd screw her for a few strokes, then relax and enjoy the feeling of being inside of her. Her breathing slowed, and I listened in the silence to the soft snoring coming from a short ways away, the occasional burst of laughter from afar, and the constant drumbeat of the rain on the tympani of our rain fly. My hands explored every inch of her flesh that I could reach, while my cock hardened within her, growing thicker, longer and harder. 

 I had fucked her. The ultimate schoolboy fantasy. The sexiest teacher in school. I'd fucked her hard, I'm made her come for me, twice. I'd spent my seed deep inside of her. All with my new girlfriend cheering us on, and taking her turn. 

 And now Shannon was lying on me, surrendering herself completely, my cock buried inside that tight, warm forbidden pussy. I was fucking her again, and I swore to myself it wouldn't be the last time. 

 Her breathing was slow and steady, hypnotic. She was asleep on me, while we continued our ancient dance. 

 I was drifting off, fighting it, so I could stay inside of her, her pussy molding itself to my shape. I dozed off for a second, and wakened as she pushed back against me. 

 "Alex," she moaned sleepily. 

 "Shannon," I whispered, thrusting harder. 

 "Again," she murmured. 

 I thrust into her again, harder, repeatedly. 

 She whimpered sweetly. "No, say my name again." 

 "Shannon," I whispered to her, kissing her forehead. "Shannon, Shannon, Shannon." 

 She chuckled softly. "Miss Shannon." 

 I groaned, getting more excited by the moment, feeling her hips respond to me. "Miss Shannon. God, you are incredible Miss Shannon. Everything I've fantasized and more. I can't believe we waited this long. I love being inside you Miss Shannon." 

 She lifted up a bit, seeking out my lips. I kissed her deeply, grunting while I came inside of her, my cock buried to the hilt, while it pulsed out its creamy prize. 

 She kissed my lips tenderly and settled back down against my chest, hugging me. "Alex, Alex, Alex. What am I going to do with you?" she whispered. 

 I surrendered in my battle to stay awake, with one last push inside of her. "Shannon," I uttered, that simple word, a prayer of thanks to God for the storm that had delivered her to me. "My Shannon." 

 * * * 

 I woke alone, slowly looking around my now sadly vacant tent. I was tired and sore all over, not the least between my legs. I had to pee like a racehorse. I rummaged through my belongings to find the only things I had to wear were a not quite dry bathing suit and a rain poncho. I arrived with five shirts, two pairs of shorts, some boxers, one bathing suit, one jacket, one rain poncho, and that's all I had left. 

 I could hear the soft echo of the raindrops hitting the tent fly, alerting me to the fact the rain may have slowed but hadn't stopped completely. The rain made me smile. I loved the rain, especially after last night. 

 I took a minute to straighten things out a bit, getting a little organized, and rechecking my inventory. I opened all the flaps to let some air in, and headed out into the real world, a little sad to leave my magical tent and its recent memories behind. 

 The voices were loud and boisterous coming from my impromptu rescue fly, and I turned away from them to take a leak, my tent blocking the view. Turning back to the protected area that John and I had created the night before, I was surprised to see the changes. 

 The single over-sized fly that everyone had huddled under was now a network of coverings, with four more tarps covering different areas, creating a virtual habitrail. The big tarp was nearest my tent, less than 10 yards away. A few feet from that one was what I liked to think of as our 'drying' tent. It had a separate smaller fire in front of it now, the heat reflected into where the clothing was hanging from ropes, drying. These first two shelters had backs that faced west and reached the ground, providing a wind break and extra protection from the elements. 

 After the first two, which John and I had erected, again separated by a few yards, was a single large overhead tarp. It had no sides or backs, but provided a nice dry area away from the business of the first two. The final tarps seemed to have been added for no particular reason. Two smaller ones, side by side, creating a long narrow shelter. Nothing was going around under it, but it did give additional coverage. 

 Just past the last shelter was the new tent zone, where the previous flooded and collapsed tents were setup in the hopes that a little sun might dry them out and make them usable again. 

 People were up and about, half-clothed, staying busy, laying out wet clothing, sleeping bags, or just looking for a place to chill. 

 I was gazing around to see who was where and what they were doing. It didn't take me long to spot Heather and Teri, both wearing my t-shirts, organizing some of the clothing in front of the drying fire. I couldn't spot Shannon anywhere, which was odd. She was always easy to identify in a crowd. Tiny Julie, on the other hand, could be invisible unless she was right in front of you. 

 A smiling face broke my reverie, as Lisa appeared before me, mug of hot cocoa in hand. Not my preferred morning libation, but I appreciated the effort. "Good morning. About time you rolled out of bed, lazy bones. You're one of the last ones up," she said. 

 "I could still use another 8 hours sleep. What was I thinking, putting that thing so close to my tent?" I asked, gesturing toward the crowded main shelter. 

 She laughed. "You were thinking it was for you, not for the entire camp. How are you feeling?" 

 "Worn out, but not complaining. You?" 

 She grinned, moving closer. "Wonderful. Got a minute for a quick chat before integrating yourself back into society?" 

 "For you? Of course. Always," I teased, taking a sip of my morning cocoa. Not bad, really. 

 She put her arm around my waist, turning me away from the crowd, walking deeper into the woods. She had my windbreaker on over my t-shirt, a Dave Matthews Band concert shirt. Definitely looked a whole lot better on her. She was quiet for the first few minutes, leaning against me, as I wrapped my free arm over her shoulders. The tree coverage overhead was dense, and it was hard to tell if it was still raining, or just branches dripping. Either way, the rainfall was almost unnoticeable. It was nice to walk through this more natural setting with Lisa. She moved well. I couldn't help but think what it would be like to go on a real trek with her. 

 "Darrel and I broke up last week. It was my decision. He's not taking it especially well, but it was his own fault. I found out he'd been screwing around with Tammy." She blurted it out quickly. 

 "Tammy? His ex? What a fucking idiot!" I almost exploded. "When he had you? What the holy fuck is wrong with him?" 

 "My thoughts exactly." She reached up and held my hand in hers, pulling it tighter around her shoulders, moving in closer. "I wanted you to know before you made any decisions about who you want to date." She was quiet for a moment. "I want to be back on your list." 

 I stopped and turned to face her. "Jesus, Lisa! You could have told me this yesterday." 

 She looked sad. "Are you saying it's too late? I know I'm not a virgin like your previous girls. I've been around a little. But I thought we had a nice thing going last night." 

 I almost laughed. "Nice thing? Amazing. And being a virgin is the least of my concerns. I never sought them out, it's just the way things happened." I leaned down and kissed her softly. "You were number one, before Darrel, and probably would be now, if not for last night. What about Julie? I've all but told her she was my choice." 

 She took my hand in hers, and started walking again, headed downhill toward the water, still away from camp. "After last night, I have no idea where things stand. What with Teri willing to make you her first, and Heather making up for past mistakes. I'm not even sure I want to know what happened between you and Miss Shannon. Julie is probably the least of our worries." 

 "Don't worry about Heather. She's not in the running. All is forgiven, but not forgotten. And Shannon's our teacher. As far as anyone should be concerned, nothing happened there, and nothing will, so long as her job is on the line." The walking was getting more difficult, and I had to help her over a couple of fallen logs, before we broke into the beach area, turning and heading back in the general direction of the camp. 

 "Teri?" she asked, cautiously. 

 "I don't know. I like her, and I tease her, and she's been my friend since 6th grade, but she's pretty much driven herself out of the running over the years. Until last night. She and I need to have a heart-to-heart, but to be brutally honest, if I picked my top 5 right now, you, your sister, and Dominique would all rate higher than her. Although it looks like my supposed best friend John has snaked Dominique out of the running." 

 Lisa chuckled. "Totally. She looks like she's fallen for him in a big way. He's the hero of the camp, thanks to you abdicating your role last night, just so you could have your way with us." 

 "Me have my way with you guys? You're kidding. I was practically gang-raped last night. I thought there might be a little kissing and grab-ass in that sleeping bag, until y'all got crazy." 

 "You complaining? After all that teasing around the campfire?" 

 "Hell no. Best damn night of my life. I challenge anyone to have a better one. Ever. I'm just saying, I was the victim, not the instigator." 

 She laughed. "Keep telling yourself that." She gave my hand a squeeze. "It was all pretty amazing though, wasn't it? God, that was so hot, riding you, with everyone touching us, not knowing who was who. And to see you deflower my sister. Unreal." 

 "I wasn't expecting that," I confessed. 

 "Who was? Did you see the shirt she's wearing? It's the one we cleaned you up with after. An actual cherry, I didn't think that really happened. I lost mine to a hairbrush. But not Julie. Nasty bloody smear on the shoulder, and she's wearing it like a championship trophy. She'll probably never wash it. Baby girl is a wild thing." 

 "Seems like a family thing," I teased, giving her a squeeze. 

 She stopped and pulled me in for a kiss. A real one this time. "It could be. A family thing. You choose me or Julie, and I'm thinking that she and I can work it out. At least she sounds cool with the idea this morning." She walked toward a huge tree, pulling me along by the hand, until we were beside the trunk, protected from the rain. She reached for the bottom of my poncho, lifting it up and over my head. She peeled off her rain-jacket, and leaned into my chest, kissing my shoulder. "God, you look good Alex. A guy shouldn't look so good." 

 I had to laugh. "Look who's talking. Prettiest girl these parts have ever seen." 

 She smiled up at me. "We'd make a good-looking couple. Don't you think? King and Queen of the ball." 

 "The queen and her jester, is what I'm thinking," I told her, leaning back against the tree, the bark rough against my skin, while I held her in my arms. 

 She squeezed me tight. "Are Julie and I really at the top of your list?" 

 "With a huge gap after." 

 "Then choose us. Us. Or choose me, and I promise I'll bring her along." Her lips were pressed against my skin, her hand pressing against, unlikely as it would seem after the previous night, my new hardness. 

 "I don't understand. Are you afraid if I tell her I choose her, she'll lock you out? I gotta be honest here. I've practically told her already, since I thought you were out of the picture. We're more than friends." 

 She shook her head. "I don't know. What I do know is that I've had two serious boyfriends in the past, and I settled. Both times. The guys I wanted didn't ask me, so I eventually gave in to those who did. I don't want to settle, Alex. Not again. You're number one for me, in a big way. Please don't make me settle for somebody else. Give 'us' a chance." 

 "Let me hammer things out with Teri, and then you, me and your sister need to have a talk. Believe me, gorgeous, you are the girl of my dreams. But I'm not going to hurt Julie." 

 "Before we leave this weekend?" she asked. 

 "Before the sun sets." 

 She grinned hugely, her smile a thing of beauty. She reached up for another deep kiss that didn't disappoint. I felt her hands pulling at my bathing shorts, and within moments she was kneeling at my feet, her sexy mouth engulfing my cock. 

 "Mmm. I wonder who this is I'm tasting? A special redhead maybe? Or an innocent little blonde. How naughty would that be? Licking my sister's dried juices off your cock." She took me back in her mouth, sucking expertly. 

 Fuck. This gorgeous sexpot could be mine. I only had to say the word. 

 I looked out across the water, the raindrops dotting the surface of the lake, the crisp clean air filling my lungs, the prettiest girl in school, with the most amazing sexy body, eagerly swallowing my cock. "This is incredible," I told her. 

 She stood, dropping her shorts and turning around, presenting herself to me. "Take me, Alex," she said softly. 

 I gazed at that perfect ass, alabaster cheeks, so soft and smooth, beckoning. I opened my legs wide to bring myself to her level, and slid inside of her. She was wet and ready. The feeling was perfect, holding her hips, filling her, using my full length on her, the beauty of nature surrounding us. I was in no hurry, finding a nice pleasant pace that didn't tax my strength, while I could concentrate on the feeling of piercing her repeatedly. Sliding inside that heavenly warmth. 

 After a few minutes she was breathing harder. "Fuck me, Alex. Harder" 

 I picked up the pace, fucking her faster, deeper, her body shifting, absorbing the pounding. 

 "God," she gasped. "Don't stop." 

 Like that was going to happen. I hammered her, the tightness doing wonders for me. She groaned, bending almost in two, and clinging to her legs. My hands dug into her hips, pulling her against me hard on every stroke, until she cried out for me, and I felt her body react to her orgasm. I was getting closer, pounding harder, faster, deeper, the need to finish rising, until it was all-consuming. 

 "I'm gonna come," I groaned, warning her. 

 "In me. Fill me with your cum, Alex," she pleaded. "Make me yours." 

 With a final deep thrust she got her wish. I grew light-headed from the feeling, and had to lean back against the tree, pulling her with me, earning the cutest little squeal for that effort. 

 A few minutes later we were walking back into camp, hand in hand. "Tonight?" she asked. 

 "We'll talk. I promise." 

 She leaned against me, "Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear." 

 * * * 

 Back in camp, I found some cereal to eat, reclaiming one of my camp chairs from the same punk who'd tried to make time with Julie earlier on the trip. He seemed eager to give it to me once I made it clear it was mine. Hell, the whole damn setup was mine. Besides, I didn't like leeches who lived off others work, and didn't contribute. 

 Sitting back, feasting on Honey Nut Cheerios, a steaming cup of coffee appeared suddenly before me. In Miss Shannon's hand. 

 "Good morning. I see you're still alive," she said grinning. 

 "Barely. Rough night." 

 She avoided any reference to the tent activities. "You did a good job with this setup. Even if your buddy John is getting all the credit." 

 I took a sip from the coffee. Strong and bitter. Divine. "Good for him. I'm not worried about it. My reward is in doing the right thing." 

 She smiled. "It is, isn't it? This whole setup must be feeding your neurotic do-gooder alter ego to no end." 

 "I like to help people who need it. So shoot me." 

 She leaned in close, whispering. "Shoot you? God, I'm dying to kiss you." 

 She stood up abruptly, mussing my hair. "You look a fright. You should clean up. And check around the camp. I'm sure there's something you could be doing to save some poor soul in need. It's been what, 3-4 hours? You must be in withdrawal." She walked away, and my eyes followed her shorts encased rear. Damn. I had hit that. Hard. 

 I got up from my chair, reluctant to leave it behind, but Shannon was right. There were things that needed doing. Conversations that needed to be held. 

 John was sitting nearby, with Dominique at his side. Too unfair. "Hey Dominique. Bozo treating you right?" 

 She smiled shyly, leaning against him. "Couldn't ask for better." 

 "Good. I'm glad. He's a little rough around the edges, but he's the best guy out here. Don't ever let him know I said so." 

 She grinned at the big lunk sitting beside her. "Our secret. I promise." 

 "Speak of the devil. John, camp savior and superhero. Walk with me?" 

 I'm sure the kiss he gave Dominique was a reminder of his new claim on her. "Again? Jesus Alex, last time you had me working half the night." The words might have sounded like complaining, but the smile he was wearing said otherwise. He got up and we started touring the camp, to see how everything was. 

 "How'd it go once I left?" I asked. 

 "Not bad. Dr. Reed showed up, but he was cool about the whole situation. Helping but not bossing around too much, and giving a lot of leeway in how people were dressing and acting. Kind of surprised me." 

 "Good. Everything else copacetic? No major problems?" 

 He gave me a shove. "I told you, under control. No problems at all. Funny how the storm brought everyone together." 

 "Dominique?" I asked. 

 "Too good to be true. I think she really likes me." 

 "What's not to like? Second best catch in the school. She's lucky." 

 He blushed. I'd never expected that. Some kind of comeback about best catch maybe. Not that. "She's something," he said softly. 

 "All yours. No interference from me, I swear." 

 He smiled, as we checked out the cooking area. "How about you? Rumor has you and Julie together. Or maybe Teri. Can't believe she's singing your praises today. And what's the deal with Heather? I thought she hated you?" 

 "Give a girl a dry tent and a warm sleeping bag, and all the old issues seem to fade, I guess. I think we're cool." I was thinking about the cooking area. "Want to move these tables? I'm sure they'd be a lot more useful under cover. Maybe under that big empty tarp near the end." 

 He kicked the heavy chain links on the ground. "It's chained to the tree." 

 I gave the chain a kick and lifted the leg off the loop. "By an idiot." 

 He sighed, walking to the far end of the biggest. "No rest for the weary, huh? You're a fucking slave driver." 

 "Lift, Toby. Work more, whine less." 

 "Fuck you, Massa," he laughed, almost falling in the mud on the first step. "Fuck! If I break my leg, I'm going to kill you, you know?" 

 "Work more, whine less," I teased. 

 We barely had the table in place, before its benches were full. I was happy to find Max, our assistant from the night before, falling in step with us. "How can I help?" he asked. Report_Story #5 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 02 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© "If you and John get the other picnic bench, I'll get the table." I was asking a lot. John and I both had a good 50 pounds on the kid. Didn't seem to matter, he was a trooper, holding up his end. I thought it a sad commentary that of six guys sitting around, only Max offered to help. Didn't surprise me, but it was disappointing. 

 I had a good memory for things like that. Max was earning himself a place on the good guys list. 

 Before we were done, the rain picked up again, light but consistent. I saw everyone scrambling toward the shelters, like they'd melt otherwise. A few of the girls were closing up the tents which were open to dry out when the occasional sunlight broke through. With John and Max in tow, we checked on all the tarps, tightening ropes that might have stretched from getting wet, and re- anchoring loose stakes. I retrieved some of my poly cord and we tied down the tarps at more points, distributing the stress, and keeping the material taut. If the wind really picked up, like last night, we'd be in trouble. All we could do was our best. We got wet, but it was warm out, and didn't feel bad. My rain gear might have been a miserable fashion piece, but it was keeping me dry on the inside. More than I could say for John. 

 He kept glancing over at Dominique. Eventually I couldn't take it. "I'm doing you a favor dragging you away. No girl wants a clingy guy." It didn't stop him from watching her. "Fine. Go. Go to her. We're done." 

 He grinned. "Good. Give a shout if you need anything. But not for at least an hour, Ok?" 

 I chuckled. "I'll leave you alone. And I'm still jealous, you homely whipped bastard." 

 "Right. I saw what came out of your tent. You're not fooling me." 

 Max was still standing beside me. "You still here? Isn't there some pretty little thing you should be chasing?" 

 He grinned. "Yeah. A couple. But hanging out with you guys even for just a few minutes helps my odds." 

 I laughed. "You little fucker. And I thought you were an altruist." 

 "I don't mind helping. If it pays off, that's just a nice little bonus. You really done?" he asked. 

 "Yeah, some personal stuff I need to take care of," I explained, seeing Teri standing nearby, watching us. "Who've you got your sights set on, anyway." 

 He nodded toward a skinny brunette girl sitting at one of the benches we'd brought over. "Wendy." 

 "Introduce me." 

 We walked over and he sat down next to her, on the edge of the bench. "Wendy, you know Alex, right?" 

 She had a nice smile, "Who doesn't?" 

 "Hey Wendy. Having fun? This is your first club trip isn't it?" 

 She nodded. "Not what I was expecting, but definitely an adventure." She had a sparkle in her eyes. Pretty little thing. I could see why Max was interested. 

 I nodded toward Max. "Take care of this guy for me, will you? The only one out here worth a damn in a crisis. Doesn't bitch and moan like John when we're fixing up this place and getting the tents straightened out." I started to turn away. "I'm only loaning him to you, understand? We'll need his help later if the rain picks up again." 

 She looked at me like I was crazy. "Me? Max?" 

 "You," I told her. "Keep the riff-raff off him. He deserves better." I turned back to Max. "Take it easy. Everything's cool now, but if the wind picks up, this place will get ugly. Let me know if you need any help taking care of the main shelter. Or get John to help you if I'm not around." 

 He nodded. "No problem. I've got it under control." He was grinning. 

 I didn't know if I'd helped or not, but if so, good. He deserved it, stepping up when nobody else did. Like I said, I remember things like that. 

 Teri was waiting patiently, standing nearby, watching me. I went to her, giving her a hug. "How are you feeling this morning." 

 She grinned. "Good, if a little frustrated." 

 "Tell me about it. Got a minute for me?" 

 "What do you think?" 

 I put my arm around her waist, walking over to my tent, ignoring the light drizzle. 

 "We can't go in there," she said softly. 

 "Not planning too. I thought we could talk here in private. I'd take you for a walk, but it looks like the rain's picking up." 

 We stood under the vestibule, while I opened the front of the tent wide, bringing out my poor blanket which had been abused the night before. I hung it up within the vestibule, then went back in to see what I had that we could sit on. My rain poncho seemed like the best option, with all my tarps in use. I took it off and laid it out on the soggy ground, and put the towels from the night before on top. I sat on them, drawing Teri down beside me. 

 She seemed unusually nervous, and kept her distance from me. Not acceptable. I pulled her close, my arm around her. "Any fallout from last night's sleeping arrangements?" 

 She shook her head. "None, thanks to Miss Shannon choosing to stay with us. Chaperoned, what could have happened? Especially with four girls," she said with a grin. 

 "Good. What are you feeling this morning," I asked. 

 "Confused. A little weirded out. That was crazy last night, wasn't it?" 

 I laughed, hugging her. "Insane. Everything cool between us?" 

 "I should be asking you that. I'm really sorry about the way I've been acting. I'm going to try to trust you more. I don't know why I haven't." 

 "It's my fault too," I told her. "I tease you way too much. Maybe I'm a little too private about my life, when it comes to my friends. I should have been clearer about my feelings all along. I never did actually come out and tell you how I feel about you, all these years, did I?" 

 She leaned into me, her head on my shoulder. "Were you really interested? Not just kidding?" 

 "Very. Seventh and eighth grade I had it bad for you. You were my personal fantasy. Didn't know how to say it. By 10th, I guess I'd kind of given up. Settled for friendship. I'm not complaining, you've been a great friend." 

 She chuckled. "We're so stupid. I always harbored hopes you'd stop the teasing and make me your girlfriend. I was tempted so many times to call you on the teasing. But I was scared, at the same time. Of course, you always had those other girls. Older girls." 

 "Where do we stand now?" I asked. 

 "You're asking me? How would I know? I'm still coming to grips with the fact you haven't slept with half our class. Of course, going from three conquests to six overnight doesn't help things. Have you decided?" 

 "Girlfriend? Not completely." 

 "Heather changes things?" 

 "No. Not really. I wish I could, but I can't get completely over the way she treated me for the last year. Forgiven but not forgotten. Although her apology was very nice." 

 "We figured that, but she was hoping. Lisa?" 

 "Yeah. She broke up with Darrel last week. Did you know?" 

 "No. But it explains a lot. I thought it was odd how she was behaving with a boyfriend at home. So Lisa or Julie, huh? Tough decision." 

 "Or you." 

 "Me? You're kidding, right?" 

 I reached for her legs and pulled her into my lap, holding her. "I'm not kidding at all. I've liked you on and off since seventh grade. Still do." I slid my hand inside her shirt, caressing her soft skin. 

 She seemed surprised. "Wow. I wasn't expecting that. You'd choose me over Lisa or Julie? Or Heather? What's the chance of that?" 

 "Best friends for 6 years counts for a lot. And I've always had a thing for smart girls." 

 She leaned into me, head on my shoulder, while I held her. "I don't know if I'm ready for someone like you, Alex. It's a huge step from where I am." 

 "How's that? You've known me forever. We get along great, most of the time." 

 "As friends. We're not talking about that now. I've never even kissed a guy before yesterday. When it comes to boys, I'm taking baby steps. You're running marathons." 

 "What do you want?" I asked, tilting her head up and kissing her softly. 

 She closed her eyes and sighed. "I don't know. I love you, Alex. I do. You've been so good for me. But I'm not sure I love you. Last night was just too intense. I get so carried away with you, I almost broke my promise to myself. That's what you do to me." 

 "You don't want to be in a relationship, then?" I asked, curious. 

 "I do. I'm just not sure it should be with you. Not my first. I think I'd rather be with someone my speed. Starting out. Learning with each other. I'd always feel inadequate around you." 

 "I'd tell you you're being silly, but it's your call. I'll tell you this much. Being able to sit down and talk like this with you, so openly, it's incredible. We can still be friends, right?" 

 She smiled. "Best friends. Special friends." 

 "But sex is out of the equation. And I guess that means no more blow-jobs." 

 "Alex!" she hissed, looking around. 

 "It was pretty spectacular." 

 "You're not even supposed to know it was me," she whispered, blushing hard. 

 "Incredible," I told her. 

 She leaned against me. "No sex. As for other things, we'll see. A lot's going to depend on your girlfriend. I'm not going to make a cheater out of you." 

 "We're cool though? You're not angry with me are you?" 

 She shook her head. "The opposite. I'm proud of you, for all you did around here, and for the way you're handling this. All of it. Heather, me, everything. I've been mean to you for a long time, and you'd still choose me. It's hard to fathom." 

 "We can be good for each other. You want a starter boyfriend? I can hook you up. Guaranteed." 

 She shook her head. "I'll take my chances on my own. Hell, I'm sure my stock is going up this very moment." She grinned, wrapping her arms around my neck and giving me a big kiss. "Look at me. I'm Alex worthy." 

 "Silly girl. You're so much more." We looked out over the scene in front of us. When we came on this trip, there was only one couple in the entire group. Now it looked like everyone was pairing up. 

 I got an idea. "Can you do me a favor?" 

 She looked at me suspiciously. "It doesn't involve getting me in private, or anything below the waist, does it?" 

 "Where's the trust, Bestie? You've set our boundaries, and I'll abide by them. Friends. As a friend, you could help out another one." 

 "How's that?" 

 "Out of all the guys on this trip, only Max over there has been of any help. He's trying to get in good with that girl beside him." 

 "Wendy?" 

 "Yeah, you know her?" 

 "Sure. Cheerleader. A little stuck up." 

 Cheerleader? I should know things like that. "Go show Max a little attention. Let him know you appreciate how much he helped last night. He worked with us getting all the collapsed tents out of the water, and re-erected on high ground." 

 "Are you asking me to flirt with him? I can't do that. I don't think I would even know how." 

 I laughed. "You're a master, and you don't even know it. Just sit by him for a bit. Thank him for his help. A little hug and kiss on the cheek would be nice. See if you can't make Wendy re-evaluate him and get her jealous." 

 "You're asking a lot," she sighed. 

 "You need the practice anyway. Give it a try. For me?" 

 She pulled my face down and gave me another long, sweet kiss. "For you. But you'll owe me." 

 She climbed out of my lap, straightened herself up, and jogged across the open ground to the cover of the shelter. I watched her go over to Max, leaning over and talking to him. She definitely had the attention of everyone in the area. They talked a bit, then she leaned down and hugged him, giving him a kiss on the lips before walking away. 

 Poor Max. He didn't know it was a setup. I saw him turn, watching her leave. He couldn't take his eyes from her. He started to get up, and Wendy grabbed his arm, speaking animatedly. He tore his eyes away from Teri, and put his arm around the cutie beside him. She smiled. 

 Another good deed. Shannon was right. I felt immensely pleased about it. My fix. 

 ================ 

 Lisa and Teri are (mostly) taken care of. Time to work things out with the younger sister and Heather. Thanks for taking the time to read this little tale. Report_Story #1 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 03 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© ====================== 

 Girlfriend decisions and campfire fun 

 ====================== 

 With my latest good deed out of the way, I decided to deal with some of my personal camp issues. 

 I put my poncho back on, grabbed my blanket and headed for the drying shelter. Nobody seemed to mind when I moved a few things around, so I could hang up my blanket under cover, but directly in front of the fire. The fire needed work. I spread it out a bit, so it would cover more of the area, and fed it. We were going through a lot of wood with two different fires, and I didn't look forward to the prospect of finding more, hopefully not waterlogged, before it got dark. 

 "You are a greedy one, aren't you?" 

 I turned and Heather was talking to me, adjusting where my blanket was hanging. "Nothing behind this is going to dry." 

 I shrugged. "My fire. My wood. My tarp. My ropes. My shelter. I guess I feel a little entitled." 

 She grinned. "There is that, I guess. I'm kind of in charge here. I'll watch over it for you. Move it to the back once it's good and dry." It was already steaming from the heat. 

 "How'd you get that job?" I asked. 

 "Same as you. Someone's got to do it." She moved nearer, stacking wood around the fire to keep it dry, one of the few people who didn't seemed worried about getting a little wet. "Thanks for last night," she said softly. 

 I laughed. "I believe I'm the one who should be thanking you." 

 She shook her head. "I've been a bitch to you for a year, for no good reason. I spread some pretty mean lies about you. You could have left me out to freeze in the rain. I probably deserved it. Still you treat me like everyone else, even better. As good as your girlfriends." 

 "I don't have any girlfriends. Not yet. Not officially." 

 We were getting a little wet by the fire, from the constant drizzle. I moved back under the shelter, and she stood by my side. "Is it too much to hope that I could be in the running?" 

 I put my arm around her. "Timing, Heather. If we'd hashed this out a while ago, I think things could be different. But I'm pretty much committed at this point." 

 "Julie? Or Teri?" 

 "Teri shot me down. Again." 

 Hard to believe Heather even knew some of the words she directed at my best friend. I had to calm her down before our chaperons took exception to her vocabulary. My lips on hers stopped the tirade. 

 She hugged me tightly, her lips hot and demanding. Making promises that I had no intention of following up on. I tried to pull back but she was insistent, before slowly releasing me. 

 "Stupid little bitch! I can't believe her. We talked about this. She promised to give you a chance. I can't believe she'd be so damn stupid!" 

 "It is what it is. She's not ready for the kind of relationship I'm looking for." 

 Heather looked up at me hopefully. "I am." 

 "I know. Let's give us a little time to put the last year behind us. For now, it's Julie or Lisa. Last night it would have been Julie, but Lisa is arguing otherwise." 

 "She has a boyfriend," Heather griped. 

 "Had. She broke up with him last week. I just found out this morning." 

 Heather sighed. "Shit, I guess that's that." 

 "Listen. I want to get to know you. The real you, not the one perpetually pissed at me. Friends, for now? Let's see what the future brings." 

 "Friends with benefits?" she asked with a smile. "I really had a good time last night." 

 "So did I. We'll see. I'm not a cheater." 

 She nodded. "I know. Now. But if everyone's cool...?" 

 "That would be wonderful. And maybe things with the sisters won't workout. I may be back on the market before too long." 

 She nodded. "Ok. Friends for now. I'd still like a chance to apologize in private. Maybe when we get back?" 

 "Maybe. I'd like that." 

 "I know you would. I promise, you'd love it." 

 "I'm starving. You think they're still serving lunch?" 

 She smiled, taking my hand in hers. "Sandwiches, in the last shelter. I could use one. I built up an appetite last night, and missed breakfast." 

 Cold cuts, bread, cheese and fixin's hit the spot. We weren't alone at late lunch, and it was nice to sit with Heather and several other campers, talking about the night before, what everyone went through, and the expectations for the coming night. Most of the tents were moderately dry, as was much of the gear. It looked like most of the camp would be able to retreat to their tents again, if the weather didn't take a turn for the worse. On higher ground this time. 

 At the end of lunch I excused myself from Heather, who went back to check on the drying racks, and made a more determined effort to find Julie. I'd seen glimpses of Lisa, Teri and Shannon all morning long, but Julie had been harder to spot. I finally checked in with her sister. 

 "Julie? Haven't seen her for a couple of hours. Not since shortly after we got back from our walk," Lisa told me. 

 Teri had no more information for me. Looks like Julie was staying out of sight. Which had me concerned. 

 We were experiencing another break in the rolling storms, so I expanded my search beyond the shelters. I finally found her sitting in her little tent. "Julie? You in there?" 

 "Yeah," she said softly. "I was trying to organize things a little." 

 "Got a few minutes for me?" 

 I heard a sniffle. "Give me a second, Ok?" 

 "As long as you want. I'll wait out here." 

 It took her about five minutes, but she finally appeared from between the tent flaps. Her eyes were red and puffy. Had she been crying? "Everything Ok?" 

 "Peachy," she said, with a false smile. 

 I held my hand out to her and she accepted slowly, letting me help her up. "C'mon. Let's walk a bit. We have a lot to talk about." 

 "I bet," she said softly. 

 This wasn't what I was expecting. We were heading away from the camp, through the original cooking area, toward the road. "What's wrong, Julie?" 

 "Nothin'," she said quietly. "Everything's back to normal." 

 "Are you mad at me?" I asked. 

 Her answer was non-committal. "Why would I be mad at you?" 

 "I don't know. I thought we had a great time yesterday." 

 "I thought we did too," she answered snidely. 

 "Then what's wrong?" 

 She stopped. "Why did you let me think I was going to be your girlfriend?" 

 Her words surprised me. "Uh...because you are?" 

 "Really? That's why you had time for every one of your girls but me today? Why you've been avoiding me?" She looked like she was ready to cry again. 

 I tried to hug her, but she was stiff in my arms. "Julie. Stop this, please. Hear me out." 

 She pulled out of my grip and started walking briskly. "Hear what out? That you're choosing Lisa over me? Or that you're with Heather? That's right, I saw you guys eating together. Or is it Teri? Making out with her in front of your tent, half-naked. I thought you liked me," she whined, tears rolling down her face. 

 There was a railing on the side of the dirt road, and I guided her over to it. I sat on the railing, pulling her against me. "Listen to me, and stop with the drama, Ok? If you're going to be my girl, you can't act like some whiny middle schooler." 

 She wiped her eyes, sniffing. "Fine. I'm listening." 

 I held her close, arms around her narrow waist. "A lot happened last night. Things I wasn't expecting, I wasn't ready for. Can you understand that?" 

 She nodded. 

 "Teri's been my friend forever. What happened last night changed our relationship drastically. We had to talk about it. We weren't making out. Pretty much just the opposite. She and I are going to remain friends. Only friends. I needed to clear that up with her." 

 "Friends?" she asked quietly. 

 "Just friends. In fact I'm thinking of helping find her a starter boyfriend." 

 Julie actually giggled. "I think I could help with that." 

 "As for Heather, it's even worse. I used to like her, then we had a year of her lying about us, followed by that torrid make-up session last night. She'd like to be with me, but I told her I already had made up my mind. She and I are going to try to be friends, and I'm not ruling out ever being more than friends with her, but not now. Lunch was just us trying out being friends for once. That was all. She's not my girlfriend, and was never even in the running. Do you believe me?" 

 She nodded. "I'm sorry. She doesn't look at you like a friend." 

 "I guess we're more than friends. Friends don't usually do what Heather and I did last night. It's awkward. That's why I had to speak with her, and get that cleared up. I'm trying to minimize the hurt feelings," I explained. 

 "What about Lisa?" she asked. 

 "That's the million dollar question, isn't it? She told me this morning that she had broken up with Darrel. That she wanted to be back on my list." 

 "What about me?" she asked piteously. 

 "You? You're my girlfriend if you'll have me." I lifted her chin and kissed her softly. "You're the one. The one I want." 

 She threw her arms around my neck and started crying, while plastering kisses all over my face. I eventually calmed her down, brushing away her tears. "Is that a yes?" 

 "Of course!" she squealed. "Are you sure? You really choose me? Over Heather? Over Lisa?" She climbed into my lap, straddling me, hugging me tightly. 

 "You're the one. I love everything about you, Julie. Except for this drama. I wasn't expecting that. Everyone else takes getting dumped better than you take getting chosen." 

 She hugged me tight. "Oh Alex, I'm so sorry. I was certain I'd lost you. I just knew it. I can't compete with those girls. I can't. How could you possibly choose me?" 

 "You make me happy, just to be around you." 

 "I'll make you happy. I promise. No more drama." 

 I held her tightly, enjoying the feel of her in my arms. "What about your sister?" 

 I felt her tremble in my arms. "Did you tell her yet?" 

 "No. That's what I wanted to talk about. I thought you already knew I had chosen you." 

 She sighed. "I thought so, last night, but today seemed so different. It seemed so impossible. It was before you had sex with Heather and Lisa." 

 "And before I had sex with you. That was pretty wonderful." 

 She smiled. "I thought so." She ground her pelvis against me, naughtily. "I'm glad you were my first." She glanced down at her shirt, with the rust colored smear on the shoulder. 

 "Me too. I really am honored you chose me." 

 She leaned against me. "It's going to kill Lisa, you know. Choosing me over her." 

 "I know. It shouldn't come as a complete surprise, though. We had a long talk this morning. I made it pretty clear that as of last night, you were the front- runner. She said if I chose her, she'd bring you along." 

 That got Julie's undivided attention. "She said that? That you should choose her, and you'd get me too?" 

 "She wanted me to choose you both." 

 Julie looked confused. "You can do that? How's that supposed to work out?" 

 "I don't know." 

 "She shouldn't be saying things like that. That you'd get me if you chose her." She looked irritated. 

 "She told me she doesn't want to settle any more. Her last boyfriends she dated, not because they were who she really wanted to be with, but they were the ones who asked. Now she wants me and doesn't want to settle for anybody else. She'd pretty much say and do anything to get her way." 

 "Why are you telling me all this, Alex? Why would you choose me, if you could choose her and get both of us?" 

 "I don't know. I guess the long and short of it is, I want you. But I don't want to hurt Lisa's feelings any more than I have to, and I don't want to create a rift between you and your sister." 

 "Am I your girlfriend? Really? No matter what?" she asked quietly. 

 "Officially. If you'd like, I'll announce it around the campfire. Hell, I'll stand on the table and shout it to the world." 

 She giggled. "That won't be necessary. But you don't mind if I tell anybody, do you?" 

 "Nope. I'd be proud." 

 Her smile got even bigger. "Would you mind if Lisa and I had a talk before things became official? We should work things out first." 

 "Of course not. You're sisters. Two of the closest I've ever seen. Anything you can do to soften the blow would be appreciated." 

 She looked at me oddly. "Do you mean that?" 

 "Of course. If you want, I can be there when you tell her." 

 "No. Let us work things out alone first, Ok?" 

 "Whatever you want, girlfriend." 

 She grinned. "You're not going to regret this, I promise. I'm going to be the best damned girlfriend you ever had. I swear, I'll do anything and everything I can to make you happy you chose me." 

 She slid off my lap, her hand rubbing the hard-on that our closeness had raised. "I'd like to start now. There's something I wanted to do last night, that I never got a chance to." 

 She was tugging at my swim shorts, and I raised my hips so she could have her way. She pulled them down to my ankles, and brought her lips to my shaft, kissing it softly. "This is my first time, Ok? So be patient with me," she said nervously. 

 "I promise." 

 "And could you lose that ridiculous poncho for a while?" 

 It was the least I could do. Although I did feel a little weird standing in the open, naked except for my muddy shoes. 

 She was fun to watch, the way she looked at me, playing with my rod, holding it, touching it, tasting it. She took it in her mouth carefully, testing her own limits, sucking so sweetly. Her sexy tongue was lively, moving, the bottom of it sliding over the top, then twisting around it, before disappearing back inside her mouth, my cock following gamely. She looked up at me, then pulled off gently. "Am I doing Ok?" 

 "It's wonderful. I'll tell you a secret. If a girl likes doing it, it makes it 100% better." 

 She grinned. "I love doing it. I love the feel of you, your hardness, and softness, the way you react. The heat, the texture, the way it responds. The way you look at me when I'm doing it." She took the head in her mouth, her tongue active, playing, while she gazed up into my eyes. The edges of her mouth somehow managed to turn up at the edges, almost smiling. 

 I relaxed and watched her play and learn, until her antics resulted in the reward she'd earned. "I'm going to come for you, Julie," I warned. 

 She held the crown in her mouth, bobbing up and down, until I gasped, shooting off in her young mouth. Her eyes bugged open wide, and she struggled to maintain her motion, gasping, and losing much of my juices down around her hand. 

 Julie was a trooper, sucking and licking her hand and my cock clean, until she leaned back, smiling, obviously pleased with her efforts. 

 She giggled. "I guess I did Ok," she said with a smile. 

 "Wonderful, Angel. Really your first try?" 

 She was still playing with my rod, wiggling it in her hand. She leaned down and licked the head, making it twitch. She laughed. "Won't be my last, I promise you that." 

 She gave me one last sweet suck, then grabbed my shorts and passed them to me. She looked up and down the empty road. "I can't believe I gave my first blow- job on the side of the road, in public, where anybody could have driven by!" 

 I laughed with her. "Your sister said you were a wild child." 

 She grinned. "I guess I am. At least with you." 

 "Feeling better now?" I asked, pulling up my shorts. 

 "100%." She walked up to me and gave me a big hug. "I still can't believe it. I mean, really, Alex Hamilton's girlfriend." 

 "I know, right? Julie Samuelsons' boyfriend! I rock!" 

 She gave me a grin, poking me. "Don't tease." 

 "We probably should head back soon. We're lucky the weather has held up this long." The sun had actually broken through a few of the clouds, but the wall of black thunderheads approaching from the west did not bode well for the future. 

 On the way back we held hands, while she regaled me with the problems of growing up with a popular older sister, and having to see the guys come and go, while always being an observer. 

 "Must have been difficult," I commiserated. 

 "Naw, not really. She was always good about it. When I started to get curious, she even set it up so I could watch from in private a couple of times." 

 "No kidding? That seems pretty cool." 

 "She even offered to get me a boyfriend, but I guess we're more alike than I'd like to think sometimes. I didn't want to settle either. Lucky for me, I didn't have to. It's pretty incredible, huh? My first real boyfriend is the guy I've been dreaming and fantasizing about for over two years." 

 I pulled her in for a hug. "Enough. You're starting to embarrass me. I'm the lucky one here. And I know it." 

 She laughed in derision. "Bullshit. But it's sweet of you to say it." 

 "What if it hadn't worked out? What if I'd gone after someone else? You put all your eggs in this one basket? Who was next on your list?" 

 She shook her head. "My list is short. One amazing guy." 

 "That's taking a huge risk, isn't it? What if I didn't like fun, charming, gorgeous blue-eyed, blonde, fallen Angels with incredible racks and a body to die for?" 

 She pouted. "I don't want to think about it. I guess I would have waited my turn, and kept on trying. I'm not like Lisa. I'm not going to settle for second best." 

 We broke into camp, and I saw Lisa was perched at the end of the first bench watching for us. Crap. This was such a mess. I liked her. A lot. Almost as much as her sweet sister. Almost. I even felt it was a little unfair, she should have a chance to be with her #1, just like I was getting my chance, and so was Julie. I knew part of it was Julie giving me her virginity the previous night. How could I dump her after that? Without even giving us a chance. Jesus, what a mess. 

 Julie stopped, tugging on my hand. "Let me talk to her now, Ok? Before we tell anybody. I don't want her to be hurt." 

 "Of course. I'd hate to hurt her. But there's only one of me." 

 She grinned. "Are you sure? No secret twin hiding out? It would solve a lot of problems." 

 "Sorry. My genetic experiments haven't gotten that far yet. If they had, I'd be making clones of you, not me." 

 "Oh really? One of me isn't enough for you?" she teased. 

 "Of course it is, but two of you is what dreams are made of." 

 She smiled mischievously. "Don't you have some camp miracle to perform? Get moving, and keep our secret a little longer." 

 "Got it. But don't leave me hanging too long." 

 "Don't worry. I'm worth the wait. I promise." 

 "I believe it. Get going. I'm going to see how the firewood situation is coming. I'm guessing we don't have much more than an hour or two before the skies open up again."

 I recruited John and Max to help with the wood scavenging, finally coercing a few more into helping, with the threat of a cold wet night ahead. As the skies darkened, I tracked down Shannon and Dr. Reed and shared my concerns. "Looks like a big storm headed this way. If the wind gets bad, and it probably will, we could lose a couple of the shelters. They're not built for a serious storm." 

 "What can we do about it?" Shannon asked. 

 "Not much. Make sure everything is well anchored. They're facing away from the storm so that should help. Except for the ones on the end. We might want to take those down." 

 "Everyone can retreat to their tents," Dr. Reed suggested. 

 "Probably. Some of those tents aren't made to survive storms like last night. Even without the flooding, they could collapse. Falling branches are an added risk." I looked around, pointing out the better ones. "The domes will flex with the wind, at least the better ones. Those two will probably have no problem," I observed, pointing out some of the better tents, "Yours too, Dr. Reed. I don't have a lot of hope for the others. Any one of them could collapse from too much rain and wind. Just not designed for it. It's a gamble." 

 "Better than the tarps, though, right?" Shannon asked. 

 "My big one is heavy duty. It won't tear. Heavy edging and grommets. Strong material. The one with the clothing drying is sturdy too. We should probably take all the clothing down, and count on half the camp sleeping under those two." Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 03 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© Shannon laughed. "30% chance of showers, huh? This is turning into quite the adventure." 

 I laughed. "Yeah, but they'll learn more from this than from 20 other tame camping trips. Survival. Staying dry and warm. Dealing with adversity. It's all good." 

 The sky was already dark, and the wind was slowly picking up. I could hear the patter of raindrops accelerating. 

 Dr. Reed surprised me, taking charge. "I'll take care of the end shelter. Shannon, why don't you find out who is in the weaker tents, and get them to move their sleeping bags under the big tarp. No sense in taking risks. Alex, can you take care of the drying tent, and building up the fires?" 

 I nodded. "Got it. Time's running out, so we'd better get moving." 

 Within minutes the campsite was like an anthill someone had kicked. Max already had his gear under the big shelter, making him available to take care of the fires. I was pleased to see Wendy at his side. "I've got to take him back now, Wendy. He's in charge of the fires." 

 She smiled shyly. "I can help. I won't get in the way." 

 "Good, the more the merrier. Max, move some of the wood to the back of the shelter, to keep it dry and to anchor the bottom so it doesn't blow away. Leave the sides of the shelter open so the wind can blow through. It might make it a little wetter, but it should hold up better." 

 "Got it. Should I do anything with the fires?" 

 "Build 'em up big. Don't want the rain putting them out." 

 Heather was still working the drying shelter, with Teri at her side. "Mmm. Two of my favorite ladies. Storm's coming. We've got to take everything down." 

 Heather nodded. "Most everything is dry anyway. Your stuff is in your tent. I dried your towels too." She and Teri were both still wearing my shirts. And I was stuck with a sticky Gore-tex poncho against my bare skin. 

 "Any of my shirts dry?" I asked. 

 She laughed. "You had five, from what I could figure out. I think four of them are lost forever, unless you want to try to get them off your girls. I'm not giving mine up without a fight." 

 Teri giggled. "Me either. Sorry, but that's the way it is. My souvenir of a pretty spectacular weekend. But I'll trade you my nightshirt as long as you don't mind Hello Kitty." 

 "That means one is left? In my tent?" 

 Heather nodded. "The one from the first day. A little dirty, but dry. Has to be better than that monstrosity you're wearing. If you were wearing that yesterday, I'm thinking you would have been sleeping alone." 

 "Right. My rain poncho would have stopped your tents from collapsing and filling with water." 

 "No, but it might have made us look elsewhere for shelter." She was grinning when she said it. 

 Teri poked her. "Speak for yourself. He could have been wearing faux fur and jodhpurs, and I would still have been climbing in that sleeping bag. Have you forgotten our furnace? I was freezing." 

 Heather leaned into me, wrapping her arm around my waist, inside my poncho. "How could I forget? My hero and savior. Those first few minutes when we had him to ourselves, absolutely wonderful. Makes me wish certain other tents had survived better. If it had been just us three, things might be different today." 

 "No shit." Teri said, surprising me with her tone. 

 "All wishing aside, we only have a few minutes left. Get this stuff down, while I see if I can find my last shirt." 

 I left Heather badgering some of the underclassmen into helping, while I jogged the few steps over to my tent. I got rid of my shoes, which were more mud than shoe at this point, stripped off the poncho, and checked inside. 

 Someone had cleaned up. Everything was stacked and organized. My shorts were folded next to my pack, and my shirt was beside them. The towels were stacked next to them. I was happy to get out of the bathing suit which had never had a chance to fully dry and was starting to chafe. I picked out my loosest knit shorts, wearing them commando, and pulled on the shirt, which felt great against my skin. My windbreaker was nowhere to be found, I figured Lisa probably still had it. Looks like I'd be wearing the poncho after all. That or get my last and only shirt soaked again. 

 I found my ball-cap by the door, and put it on, a little frightened of what my hair must look like. A swig of mouthwash had me feeling a little more civilized. Nothing I could do about two days of stubble. 

 I left the tent feeling like a new man. I took my poncho with me, in case I needed it, but was happy to carry it. 

 From my tent the big shelter was the closest, and I jogged over barefoot, rather than wear my miserable shoes. It was a little crazy in there, with half a dozen sleeping bags lined up in the back, and more being laid out as I watched. 

 Shannon, my Shannon, was directing things and came over to me. "How are you holding up?" 

 "Great. Honestly, I've never felt better." 

 She grinned. "Boy Scout mode. You're in your element, aren't you?" 

 I shrugged. "It's fun to get things done. How about you?" 

 "Better than I would have thought. I'm still trying to figure out the logistics of sleeping tonight. You've got the biggest tent, but I'm not sure how good it would look for you to have it full of girls again." 

 I looked around. This was no place to be talking about what I was thinking. "Come with me?" 

 She nodded, and followed me back to my tent entrance. My one place of semi- privacy. 

 "We have 22 people right? And Dr. Reed has his own tent, which I suspect he'll have the good sense to use alone." 

 She grinned. "0 for 1. He's going to stay in the big shelter, as chaperon. He's already told two of the girls they could use his." 

 The day was full of surprises. "Ok. That leaves 19. The two best domes can hold up to three each. One is John's." 

 Shannon nodded. "I believe he's going to try to get Dominique to share it, if Dr. Reed and I turn a blind eye. Which I think is the plan. I'm not going to make a fuss." 

 "Ok, 17. Who is in the other one?" 

 "Erica and Kaylee. We might convince them to let in one more person." 

 "Let's say we don't. That leaves 15. If there were four in my tent, we could easily fit the rest of them under the two best shelters. It should work out." 

 She looked at me suspiciously. "And who are you thinking should be in your tent tonight?" 

 "I'm hoping Julie and Lisa, and my favorite chaperon." 

 She took her time answering. "It can't be like last night. That was crazy. You and I can't do anything." 

 "I know. I shouldn't have done that. Put you in that position." 

 She smiled. "Which position? The one with my knees around my ears?" 

 "Jesus, Shannon! Don't remind me. Now I can't be seen in public for another 10 minutes." 

 She laughed. "I know. You're right. I'm not complaining, but we can't do it again. Not here. I'm trusting that Julie can keep a secret." 

 "She will, or she'll be finding a new boyfriend." 

 "So she won the lottery? Must have broken a few hearts." 

 "Teri's cool about it. Heather's a little disappointed." 

 "What about her sister? She seemed to have her claws dug in pretty good." 

 "I don't know. They're talking it out. I'll have to hunt them down soon and see how that went." 

 "What if Teri wants to be in your tent. You going to say no?" 

 "She'll be welcome. I don't think it's likely." 

 She sighed. "I guess if I'm going to play chaperon, I should get my sleeping bag. At least give the appearance of propriety." 

 "Same for the sisters, if that works out. We can use theirs as extra padding," I said, grinning. 

 "Alright. I'll tell Dan about the plans." 

 "Dan?" 

 "Dr. Reed," she explained. 

 I laughed. "I thought Doctor was his first name." 

 She grinned. "It's a big deal to him. The whole doctorate thing. Shall we get going? I think the storm's about to hit." 

 We headed back to the crowd, Shannon hunting down her fellow chaperon, and me looking for my new girlfriend. Didn't take too long to find them. They were at the last shelter, now that the food shelter had been taken down. They were sitting together, seemingly in a good mood. Still, I approached with more than a little trepidation. 

 "You pretty girls mind if I join you?" I asked. They had the picnic bench to themselves, while everyone else hustled. 

 They moved apart, and Julie patted the space next to her. "I'd be upset if you didn't." 

 I sat down, not knowing how to ask what needed asking. 

 After a few awkward moments, Lisa laughed out loud. "Now I've seen everything. Mr. Alex Hamilton, lost for words. Are you afraid I'm going to make a scene?" 

 Not helping. 

 "Don't tease him, Lisa," Julie told her sister. "This isn't funny to him. He's been all stressed out over it." 

 "Good thing you gave him a little stress relief out by the road then, isn't it?" 

 "I only gave him a blow-job. I didn't drop my panties for him, when I knew he was still trying to figure things out," Julie snapped. 

 "I wasn't wearing panties. Besides, I had to get my bid in, didn't I? For all the good it did." She looked at me. "Not that I'm complaining, it was fun, and really hot." Her face moved even closer, just inches away. "I've felt your juices leaking out of me all day. You came a ton inside of me." 

 Julie leaned into me, catching my attention. "So, boyfriend, if we decided to share you, how would we do it?" 

 I was stunned. I looked over at Lisa, who was smiling, while Julie kept up the questioning. "What do we tell everyone? Are you her girlfriend? Mine? Both of ours?" 

 "I...I don't know. This is all new to me." 

 Julie giggled. "You said you wanted a clone of me. Lisa's about as close as you're going to get. Unless you'd rather choose just one of us. I gotta warn you, that'll probably piss off both of us, no matter who you choose." 

 I turned to Lisa. "You're alright with this?" 

 "It was my idea, wasn't it? I didn't think you'd make Julie work it out for herself. You should have just come to me, dummy." 

 "How do you guys want to handle it?" I asked. 

 Julie answered. "She wants to say you're dating us both. It'll probably raise some eyebrows, and things will be a little rocky at home, but we wouldn't have to hide anything. I think we should take turns. You could date me, with her on the side, then later you could date her, and I'd be the secret third wheel. We could have fun with that, making up excuses to break up and get back together, and watching everyone deal with our weird relationship." 

 "I don't like hiding things," I told them after a few seconds of thought. 

 Lisa grinned. "Two against one. Can that work for you, official girlfriend?" 

 Julie gave me a hug. "Mom's going to raise hell. We might even get grounded. You have a problem with that, sister girlfriend?" 

 "None. This will be so awesome. We're going to have everyone talking." Lisa moved in close. "Can we make it official? We're both your girlfriends? 50/50?" 

 "It works for me," I told her. "More than I could ever have dreamed of, so nobody pinch me for at least a year." 

 Wrong thing to say. They both started pinching me. "Wake up and accept it. You are ours, and that's the end of it," Lisa told me. 

 "Only ours, got it?" Julie growled, pinching me harder than the teasing warranted. 

 I laughed, pushing their hands away. "Can I get a kiss from my new girlfriends, to make it official?" 

 Lisa giggled. "You can have a kiss anytime you want. I think we'll make it official later. In your sleeping bag." 

 Ouch. "We're going to have company in the tent. Shannon is going to chaperon. No girls and guys in tents alone, remember? We can't hide it, since almost everyone else will be sleeping under the shelters." 

 "That shouldn't be a problem, she's cool. Does that mean we'll be able to share your tent openly? Since we do have a chaperon." 

 "Absolutely. We should move your sleeping bags in now, before the rain picks up any more." 

 "Sleeping bags? Why?" Lisa asked. 

 "For appearances. No way you're not sleeping in mine tonight." 

 She grinned. "As long as that's clear. You really think Miss Shannon will be cool with that?" 

 "She knows. She's already moved her sleeping bag in there." 

 Julie stood up. "Let's get moving. Just us four then?" 

 "I think so. I haven't talked to Teri yet. I don't know what her plans are." 

 Lisa spoke up. "She can come visit, but I expect you to keep the play just between the three of us." 

 "Not a problem. No sex between me and Teri. We've agreed on that. Friends only." 

 Julie giggled again. "That would be pretty wild. Having her and Miss Shannon in there with us, our audience, while we rock your world." 

 Lisa chuckled. "I told you she was the wild one." 

 "I think I'm beginning to believe you. Let's get moving then. I'll save us a place by the fire, probably at the smaller shelter." 

 I gave them each a quick kiss goodbye, still incredulous over my miraculous fortune. Both of them. Unbelievable. I got up and hunted down Teri, who was sitting by the small fire, next to John and Dominique. It looked like they had the shelter to themselves. Perfect. 

 She scooted over against John, making room for me. "Hey stranger. You done with your camp stuff and ready to take a break?" she asked. 

 I sat down, putting my arm around her. "Absolutely." The wind was gusting pretty hard, and the rain was consistent, if not yet torrential. "What are your sleeping plans for tonight?" I asked. 

 She blushed. Really. Bright red. "I hadn't thought about it too much. What are you doing?" 

 "Me and the sisters in my tent. Miss Shannon will be there chaperoning." 

 John laughed. "Sucks to be you, bud. Both Samuelsson and Miss Shannon there to keep you behaved. That's twice in a row now? Looks like someone up there is pissed at you. What do they say, No good deed goes unpunished? You've got a lot of punishing coming your way." 

 "Right. Like you haven't been doing your share of good deeds. Gorgeous over there doesn't look like much punishment." 

 Dominique giggled. "That's where you're wrong, Alex. I'm going to make his life hell. He gets to find out what dating a princess gets him." 

 "Poor bastard. Not like there aren't a thousand guys that wouldn't kill to take his place." 

 She laughed. "Like you?" 

 "In a heartbeat. You were top of my list." 

 She looked shocked. "Shut up. I was not." 

 "Ask Teri." 

 She looked around John at Teri, who nodded. "Top three. He won't tell us the order. You and Julie. Lucky for you John stepped up, or he'd be hounding you to death." 

 I was surprised to see Dominique blush. Two for two. A good evening. 

 "Fuck, dude! What did you say about not interfering?" John snapped, sounding sincerely pissed. 

 "Who's interfering? You won the big prize didn't you? You guys are a couple now, aren't you Dominique?" 

 She nodded. 

 "It's cool. I'm with the sisters, you've got Dominique. The best girls this school has to offer, with two guys who don't deserve 10 seconds of their attention." 

 Teri interrupted. "The sisters? You're not planning on dating both of them are you?" 

 "Their idea. Not mine. Has me scared spitless." 

 That turned John around. He laughed loud enough to attract attention. "We are so screwed. At least I'm only going to be wrapped around one pinky. Those girls are going to own you so bad." 

 "Don't I know it." 

 Dominique looked even more surprised than Teri. "I don't get it. Both of them? Are you going to take turns or what?" 

 "Two girlfriends. Both of them at the same time. Don't ask me how it works out, I figure I'll just do what they tell me." 

 I turned to John. "Don't want to sound interfering," I said exaggerating the interfering part, "but I thought I'd let you know that it would be cool if you guys wanted to share a tent tonight. Apparently I'm the only one around here who needs chaperoning." 

 That had the girls giggling. John was slow to answer. "Uh...I hadn't really thought about it." 

 I leaned over and looked at Dominique. "He's lying. He's thought about it. Probably a lot. Doesn't have the cojones to suggest it." 

 "Alex, man, keep it up and you and I are really going to have a problem." 

 "Bullshit. Ask her." 

 "He doesn't have to. Now I won't have to sneak in," Dominique answered. 

 "Room for two more?" I heard Lisa ask. I turned from the fire, to see the two girls approaching, their hands full. 

 Dominique scooted down, dragging John with her. Teri followed, leaving space for Lisa on that side. Julie sat next to me on the other. Lisa had my coffee pot in her hands. "Get this going. I want some cocoa." 

 Julie was passing out cups. "He only has 4. Can you guys come up with two more?" 

 John looked out at the rain, which was heavy, pounding down on the tarp. Lisa was wearing my windbreaker and took it off, handing it to him. "Hurry. If you have any contraband, bring it." 

 While he was up, I tended the fire, adding wood and dragging some coal near the edge, where I set the coffee pot. The girls had filled it with water, saving me a trip. 

 "What did we interrupt?" Lisa asked. 

 "Your boyfriend teasing the shit out of his supposed best friend." Teri said. 

 "Teasing you? Why?" Julie asked. 

 "Not me. John." Teri said. 

 Lisa put her arm around Teri. "You going to share our tent tonight?" 

 Teri looked at me. "I don't know. We hadn't talked about it." 

 I was staying out of it. Tending fire had become my permanent job until there was a little more testosterone around our circle. 

 Julie chimed in. "You should. It'll be fun. At the least you know it's going to be the most comfortable place to sleep." 

 "You sure? I don't want to be a third wheel." 

 Lisa laughed. "Fourth wheel. And that's Miss Shannon's job. Come with us." 

 Dominique was watching the interplay with open wonder. 

 I couldn't play with the fire forever. As it was, I was getting soaked. I stood and backed away from the fire. "Anyone seen my poncho? I don't remember where I put it." 

 "You had it at the picnic table," Lisa said. 

 I went to retrieve it, although it was a little late. I figured I'd need it sooner or later. 

 A sudden burst of gale force wind had the tarp overhead snapping, and the skies finally opened up with the torrential downpour I'd been expecting. I hurried back to our little group, as the girls pushed back the seating log, further from the fire and away from the splatter of incoming rain. 

 I slipped on the poncho, just as John came running into the shelter, hunched over under my windbreaker, and soaked to the skin. "Great fucking idea. Thanks Lisa." 

 She took it in stride. "Next time come to the fire prepared. Or run faster." 

 He stood back away from the fire, peeling off the windbreaker and his shirt, before wringing it out. 

 I didn't have time to joke around. I fed the fire, trying to keep it alive long enough to survive the flood. The flames were leaping at least 3 feet high when I went to check on the others. 

 "Boy Scout mode kicking in," I heard Teri tease. 

 The big shelter seemed to be holding up well. The fire was burning strong, with Max parked in front of it taking charge. 

 I grabbed a few logs and added them to the end, trying to extend the width of the fire a bit. "Looks good, Max. How's everything else going?" 

 He grinned. "Couldn't be better." 

 I turned to Wendy, who was sitting nearby to no surprise. "I'm borrowing him again. Sorry." 

 She grinned. "Just bring him back in one piece." 

 "C'mon Max. Quick tour to see how it's holding up under the wind." 

 He stood and walked with me as we checked each of the tie downs, giving a quick tug on each string. Everything was doing fine. "Looks like it's going to hold." I turned to him. "How's things with Wendy?" 

 "Unbelievable. I hope it lasts beyond the weekend." 

 "If it doesn't, there's other fish in the sea. I've seen a few lovelies looking your way." 

 He grinned. "They probably figure if Wendy's interested, I can't be all bad." 

 "Shit. You're an alpha male. Take charge guy. You run this shelter. It's a genetic thing. Girl's love that crap." I gave him a friendly shove. "Go back to your girl. You made a move on her yet?" Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 03 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© "Holding her. Arm around the shoulder." 

 "Enough. You're going to make me slap you for being a pussy. Go back and thank her for waiting and give her a kiss. On the lips. A little tongue would be good." 

 He looked at me like I was crazy. "In front of everyone?" 

 "Of course. Like it's expected. Trust me. The worst she could do is get pissed at you. If she does, ignore her, and give your attention to someone else. She'll come crawling back for more." 

 "She only started talking to me today," he whined. 

 "Man up, Max! Do it. Trust me on this." 

 I spotted Shannon standing to one side, watching our interplay. "Go, I've got stuff to do. Stop by the small fire later and let me know how it goes. Twenty bucks says she's snuggling you and not vice versa 10 minutes from now." 

 I walked over to Shannon. "I've got water boiling." 

 "Coffee?" she asked, her eyes lighting up. 

 "Not yet. The girls want cocoa. I'll have the coffee ready in 15 if you want to stop by. Everything working out over here?" 

 "Better than I expected. It's not the cluster-fuck it was last night, that's for sure." 

 "Good. Then relax a little. We've got space by our fire if you'd like to join us." 

 "Who's us?" 

 "Me, Teri, John and Dominique, Lisa and Julie." 

 "You got your sleeping arrangements worked out?" she asked. 

 "Looks like Teri will be joining us." 

 Shannon nodded. "That's good. The more the merrier. Looks a lot less suspicious. Don't want the good name of our favorite Boy Scout to get sullied." 

 I smiled. "I'm gonna run and get the coffee. Stop by later, Ok?" 

 "Wouldn't miss it." 

 The poncho was a lifesaver. With the hood pulled up, I stayed dry running to my tent. I found my second water pot and the coffee. I also found my canteen, which was still half full of 151. 

 There were three new sleeping bags in my tent. It was getting crowded. I couldn't help but wonder where Teri and Shannon were going to sleep. Were they going to be in the big sleeping bag? I figured Shannon would probably sleep in her own, and Teri would most likely be cajoled into getting into the shared one. Could be interesting. 

 I grabbed my big blanket as a last thought, and loaded down, headed back to my fire. Walking through the big shelter, I saw that Max was openly necking with Wendy. Good for him. 

 In the small shelter I dumped the gear. I kicked myself for not filling the coffee pot for water. The water was running off the side of the shelter in buckets. I held the pot under a steady stream, feeling the weight slowly increase. 

 "What's that for?" Julie asked. 

 "Coffee." 

 "Is that sanitary?" Teri asked. 

 "Boiled rain water? I'd say so. You don't have to drink any if you don't want to." 

 I kept the poncho on while I checked on the fire and swapped out the coffee pots. The first one was boiling. Stepping back out of the rain, I held it up. "Who's for cocoa?" 

 All four girls held out their mugs. I poured each one full, then refilled it from my roof tap. Once it was back in place next to the other pot, I pulled out my canteen. "Vitamins, anyone?" 

 "Vitamins?" Dominique asked. 

 "Bacardi, good for what ails ya." 

 They all nodded, and I added an ounce or so to each mug. I stepped back into the shelter, peeling off the poncho before wrapping the blanket around my girls. "Sorry Dominique. You're going to have to switch places with John if you want in." 

 She looked up at John, eyes raised in expectation. He sighed, stood up and waited for her to scoot over next to Teri before sitting back down. 

 I sat on the opposite end, next to Julie. "What did I miss?" 

 "Nothing, nosy," Lisa quipped. "Serves you right for abandoning us." 

 Teri laughed. "Get used to it. The last Boy Scout. The public good always comes first." 

 Lisa sighed. "Great. Now you tell us. Anything else I should know? I figure you and John over there know him best. What are we getting into?" 

 John laughed. "You're on your own. Nobody really knows him. Pig-headed do- gooder who keeps to himself. Now if Shannon were here, she might be able to help." 

 "Leave her out, John," I said softly. 

 He looked away. Only John knew about Shannon's relationship with our family, since he was practically one of us. Not even Teri knew. "Sorry. I forgot." 

 Lisa turned to me. "You've got to be kidding! You can't leave it like that! What's the scoop on Teach?" 

 I glared at John, trying to figure out how to save the situation. Max chose that moment to come running over. He squatted down next to me, beaming. "I owe you twenty. Friggin' second base." 

 I laughed putting my hand up for a high five. He smacked it hard. "What do I do now?" 

 "Ease back. She'll make the next move. Don't press it. And don't do anything more than kissing until you have a little privacy." I looked around our shelter. "You might want to move your sleeping bags over here for later. None of us will be staying here. You might get it to yourself." 

 "Cool. Thanks. I owe you." He looked over and saw Teri sitting with us. He smiled at her. "Hi Teri, uh...thanks for earlier." 

 She grinned at him. "Good luck." 

 He took off practically running. 

 "What was that about?" Julie asked. 

 "Girl advice. He's striking pay-dirt with Wendy." 

 Lisa laughed, "And he's coming to you for advice? You succeed in spite of yourself." 

 "Say what you will. She wasn't speaking to him yesterday. Now she's all over him like a cheap suit." 

 Lisa slid off her seat, sitting on the ground in front of the fire. "I could really use a shoulder massage," she said, looking over at me. 

 I got up and took her seat, letting her lean back into me, while I rubbed her shoulders. 

 "Shit," Teri muttered. "This is how everything started last time. Don't go causing trouble, Alex." 

 "Me? You guys started it all." 

 "Us?" Julie spoke up. "All that kissing, talk of cheating, dirty stories. That was all your doing, Don Juan." 

 "Oh no you didn't!" I told her. "The Don Juan myth was killed, remember. Three. That's it." 

 Teri giggled. "Six, now. Almost seven." 

 Dominique was confused. "Three? Six? Seven?" she asked. 

 Teri turned to her, "How many girls have you heard he's been with?" 

 "Jesus, Teri! Again?" 

 "Come on, Alex. She was on the list. She should know." 

 Even John looked confused, "Know what?" 

 "How many," Teri asked Dominique again. 

 "I don't know. Maybe 10?" 

 Teri hooted her joy. "Exactly! That's what we thought. But it was only three. All the rest made it up." 

 Dominique looked surprised. "But why? Who would make up something like that?" 

 "Heather for one. Who knows why? Maybe because he's too much of a gentleman to call a girl a liar. I don't know." 

 I was getting irritated. "Damn it Teri! As far as anyone is concerned, Heather didn't make anything up. Got it?" 

 Teri just rolled her eyes at me. 

 "What did you mean by six?" Dominique asked. 

 "See what you started, Teri? Jeez, you're nothing but a pain in the ass." I told her. 

 "You know you love me," she giggled, leaning into me. "Since forever." 

 "Pain. In. My. Butt." 

 "Shoulders," Lisa reminded me, squirming under my idle hands. 

 I went back to rubbing her, glaring at my supposed best girl friend. 

 Julie leaned forward. "There was kind of a competition for this bum, if you can believe it. Four girls vying for his attention. If he was more of a jerk, and played his cards right, he could have had all of us. Not all at once, but probably all, if he was leading us on. That would have been seven. Turns out Heather's not really in the running. Six. So we're still looking at three, but numbers four and five might be on his horizon if he plays his cards right." 

 Nice little surprise. Julie covering for us. Too much idle talk about what happened in the tent the previous night wouldn't be good. Especially since we supposedly had a chaperon. 

 Dominique was fascinated. "Do you guys always talk about this kind of stuff so openly?" 

 "No!" I answered quickly. "You open up once, in private, with everyone promising to keep it a secret, and this is what happens." 

 "Jesus, Alex, don't be an ass! Look at where you are! You've got two of the hottest girls in school as your new girlfriends. That's what happens when you open up. Tell him Lisa. If he didn't tell us the whole truth last night, would you be here with him now?" 

 Lisa took a sip from her spiked cocoa before answering. "Probably not. I thought he was a sleaze and a cheater. Didn't want Julie getting involved with him, just to get her heart broken." 

 She looked up at me. "You really do have a bit of a rep. We're going to have to do something about that." 

 "But I didn't do anything!" 

 Julie giggled. "We know that. Now. You're not the bad boy everyone thinks you are. You really should hear what Denise says about you. Such a perv." 

 It was a little hard having everyone laughing at my expense. Julie hugged me, gluing herself to my side, kissing my shoulder. "Is it so bad? We like the open you. A lot. Enough to make a spectacle of ourselves." 

 I turned and kissed her. "Open book, Angel, if that's what you want." 

 She giggled. "Ding-ding-ding! Right answer. Tell the man what he won, sissy." 

 "Alex Hamilton! You've won two hot young blue-eyed blondes, measurements 36-25- 34, who are going to spend as long as you want making you the happiest man in town, and the envy of every red-blooded male for 100 miles around. But wait! That's not all. You've also won the heart of your childhood friend, who may be a pain in your ass, but will stand up for you against anyone, and may even, someday, fulfill your fondest wishes. Total value of this package is more than you could ever hope to pay." 

 "34-22-32," Julie added. 

 "Fondest wishes aren't guaranteed and are not typical, see childhood friend for actual likely results," Teri finished, chuckling. 

 What had I gotten myself into? 

 "Share, sissy?" Julie said teasingly. 

 "Might as well. He's doing a shitty job. So much better when he was still chasing us." Lisa got up, taking Julie's place next to me, while the younger sister settled in between my legs. She pulled off her shirt, sitting in a bikini top. "You have to keep him interested." 

 "Tease," Lisa muttered. 

 "You're just mad because you didn't think of it first." 

 "I can't. I'm not wearing anything under my shirt," Lisa argued. 

 "You think he'd complain?" Teri piped in. 

 Dominique was laughing. "Can anyone get a massage? Or is it limited to girlfriends?" 

 "Hardly," Lisa answered. "Teri started it. Back when she was still pissed at him." 

 "That was before," Teri argued. 

 "Oh. So now you won't even get a massage from him? It's not cheating. Is it Julie?" Lisa asked. 

 "No problem here. As long as it's in front of us and not behind our backs." 

 I was trying to stay a little more focused on the task at hand, rubbing Julie's shoulders and staring down into her cleavage. I had that to look forward to. Damn, she had nice tits. 

 The rain had slowed for a bit but was now a steady downpour. Between the noise of the rain beating against the tarp, and the ten foot wide sheet of rain separating our shelter from the larger one, we were as isolated as if we were on our own island. The trees the tarps were tied to, plus the stack of wood under the shelter staying dry, completely blocked the view of the adjoining crowd. I liked that. 

 "John, make yourself useful. You should be rubbing someone's shoulders by now. I'll be damned if I'm going to be the designated masseuse." 

 I looked over to see Dominique settling in between his legs, pulling off her shirt, exposing her bra. 

 She saw me looking and grinned. "Your friends are a bad influence." She looked up at Teri. "And nothing about this leaves this group, right?" 

 Teri nodded. "Of course. He's the only one I can't help myself around." She turned to me, and pulled my head down for a kiss. "You know I don't mean nothing bad, right?" 

 "Pain in my butt," I muttered. 

 "Don't be that way," she pouted. "You're hurting my feelings." 

 "Fine. One more kiss then, and all's forgiven." 

 The next kiss was a good one, sweet and lingering. Distracting. 

 "Enough kisses," Julie spoke up. "Let the man do his job." 

 Teri pulled back grinning. "Forgiven?" 

 "Always," I assured her, my hands back to work, wandering a little more than might be seen as reasonable in mixed company. 

 "Share?" Lisa asked her sister. 

 "Aww, he was just getting good," Julie whined, getting up and switching places with her sister. 

 Lisa pulled off her shirt, flashing us all for a moment, before covering her breasts with it. She looked up at me. "Consider this a challenge. How well you do here will influence my behavior later." 

 I was doing my damnedest to give her the best massage ever, when Shannon showed up, a garbage bag over her head, doing a mediocre job of keeping her dry on the journey from the main shelter to ours.. "Things are looking pretty cozy over here. You guys behaving?" 

 Julie giggled. "No. Sit with us Miss Shannon. Tell us stories. John says you know more about Alex then either him or Teri." 

 Shannon glared at John who had the good sense to look ashamed, while he rubbed his new girlfriend's naked shoulders. "John said that?" 

 "It just slipped," he muttered piteously. 

 She sighed, shaking her head. "I don't suppose you could take your wandering hands off that poor girl long enough to get your old worn out teacher a cup of coffee, Alex?" 

 I'd completely forgotten about the coffee. I leaned down and gave Lisa a quick kiss. "Give me a minute?" 

 She smiled. "For Miss Shannon? Take two." 

 I hopped up, throwing on my poncho, and stepping out into the pouring rain. It was still coming down in buckets, but the wind was almost reasonable. I retrieved the coffee pot, coffee already mixed in. "It's going to be strong, almost a quarter of the pot's boiled away." I filled Shannon's cup, then John's. 

 Shannon produced a second cup and held it out. 

 "Is that mine?" I asked. 

 "For Dan. He's earned it. For once." 

 I filled it for her and looked for my own, filling that one as well. I added another half scoop of coffee, and refilled the pot with rainwater, putting it back on the fire after dragging over some more coals. 

 Teri had the powdered cocoa out and was putting some in each of the girl's mugs. "Refills?" she asked. 

 I got the second pot of boiling water and filled their mugs. Another rain refill, and everyone seemed set. I grabbed the rum canteen and walked down the line, giving everyone a splash. No comment from Shannon, so I gave her a double. She had some catching up to do. 

 I worked on building up the fire again, until it was too hot to stay near. When I turned around, I saw Teri walking off. "Where's she going?" I asked. 

 "Delivering the coffee," Shannon said, sipping hers. "I'm not moving. First time I've been warm all night." 

 "Take Teri's seat. Get under the blanket," I told her. 

 "Hardly seems fair, since I just sent her away." 

 "She'll be fine. She's been nothing but trouble tonight, anyway." 

 I took off my poncho, shaking the water out of my hair, before retaking my own place between Julie and Shannon. Lisa slid back up against me. 

 "Long two minutes," she said. 

 I leaned down and kissed her. "Sorry." I went back to rubbing her shoulders. 

 Teri showed up and squeezed into where Dominique had been sitting before getting her massage. John had to scoot over a bit, but they managed. She grabbed the end of the blanket and pulled it around her own shoulders. 

 "A little crazy over there. They're playing truth or dare by the fire." 

 Shannon laughed. "And that's any worse than topless massages?" 

 My hands were working the sides of Lisa's breasts. Caught dead to rights, I wasn't going to say a thing. 

 "Stories, Miss Shannon. Spill. We want to know what we're getting into." 

 Teri, of course, was the real trouble maker. "How come you know so much about him, anyway?" 

 Shannon sighed. "I trust this is all just between us, right?" 

 Everyone assured her of their eternal silence. 

 "It's not that big a deal. Not really. We just like to keep it under wraps. When I first started teaching here, I had a few problems, and our notorious do- gooder couldn't help but come to the rescue. John too, for that matter. I didn't know anyone in the area, and Alex's family welcomed me like a long lost child. His mother and I are good friends now, and I spend a lot of time at their place, especially on the weekends. It's been that way for over a year now. I knew his old girlfriend pretty well. His father, not as much, he's overseas most of the time. Gives me and his Mom a lot of time together. I guess I know him as good as anyone, outside of his family." 

 Lisa spoke up. "Doesn't seem that big a deal, not worth keeping a secret." 

 "It's not. But there are always busybodies. If certain people knew I spend almost every weekend at the home of one of my students, tongues would wag. I don't need that crap." 

 "Any good stories?" Julie asked, persistent as a bulldog. 

 "Lots. But I'm a lot like him. Private. I'm not telling if he doesn't want me to." 

 "He doesn't mind," Julie argued. "He promised he'd be an open book. So far all we've seen is the cover and the end page. Maybe the introduction." 

 "Let me hear it from him." 

 I sighed. No getting out of it. "I don't mind." I shrugged, giving it some added thought and coming to a new realization. "You know what? I really don't. John and Teri I've known forever. And I figure my girlfriends can know anything they want. I don't want to keep anything from any of them. Dominique as John's girlfriend might as well hear it too. Half the stories probably involve him anyway. Tell 'em anything." 

 I should have shut up. Turns out Shannon knew every good deed I'd ever done since I was 6 years old, thanks to Mom. She spent the next hour entertaining everyone at my expense, while I took turns massaging the girls. All of them. It started out with Julie and Lisa of course. Then Teri had to get her turn. Shannon decided she wasn't going to go on until she got a coffee refill and a chance at a massage of her own. I was more than happy to oblige. She didn't complain once about my perpetual erection trying to drill a hole through her spine. 

 Teri, as usual, had to upset the cart, complaining that Dominique was hogging two of the four hands doing the massaging. John got dragged into things, massaging Teri, and then Lisa. Dominique figure she deserved a shot with me. After that it was a free for all, every few minutes another beautiful girl between my legs, leaning back against my inevitable hardon, while entertained by Shannon's seemingly endless tales. 

 The stories ran the gamut. Some made me seem silly, others, I still was proud of. Shannon told the tale of one of my earliest attempts at righting wrongs, and helping out the weak, when I took on my first bully. Dad was wrong. Sometimes standing up to a bully just got your ass kicked. Especially when you're seven years old and the bully is 11 and has friends the same age. 

 "Your Mom said you lost two teeth and got your nose broke for that one. I'm surprised it didn't get you out of the good deed business." 

 "Baby teeth. No big deal." It had been a big deal. I'd been afraid to go home and cried like a baby. 

 "He's a planner, our Boy Scout. His father taught him how to fight dirty, and Alex here took them all on, one at a time, ambushing each and hospitalizing two. Damn seven years old and the terror of the neighborhood. Their parents apparently complained and his father laughed in their faces, threatening to do the same to them for raising bullies." 

 "Everyone faces bullies," Lisa said. "Doesn't seem like much of a good deed." 

 Shannon had a quick answer. "They weren't bullying him. They were bullying older kids. Girls. Made one of them cry in front of him. That was their mistake. Once the waterworks start, his common sense goes out the window." Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 03 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© That had my girlfriends teasing me for trying to be a seven year-old superhero. It also got me some nice kissin' so I wasn't complaining. 

 Teri had maneuvered herself in front of me, and had joined the ranks of the topless, as naked as Lisa, with her T-shirt wrapped around her chest. "Do you know how I met him?" she asked Shannon. 

 "I do. But that's your story to tell." 

 "It's not a big complicated story. Pretty simple, really. Back in 6th grade I rode my bike to school, at least on nice days. Only a few miles each way. Too long to walk in a reasonable time, but less than 10 minutes on bike. 

 "I stayed late for theater, and the weather started to get bad. I tried to rush things, and ended up crashing my bike a couple of blocks from school. Bad. My back wheel wouldn't even turn afterward. 

 "Alex found me dragging my bike, crying in the rain. I had a bloody knee and probably looked like shit. He stopped and helped me. He was like a real life hero. He put my bike over his shoulders, made me sit on his handlebars, and rode me to my house. He dropped me off, and told me he'd fix my bike. The next morning it was under my carport, working like a charm. I didn't even know his name." 

 Teri was crying, which I thought was a little silly. "It was no big deal, Teri. Anybody would do it." 

 "God, Alex! You are such an idiot! Nobody else would do it. Nobody else stopped to help me. It was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for me, and to you it's no big deal. I remember every moment like it was yesterday. When you stopped, and I was scared, I didn't know what was going on, in the dark and the rain. You gave me your jacket, checked on my knee, and brushed my tears away, begging me not to cry. You put that stupid bike over your shoulders, when it probably weighed almost as much as you, and insisted that I sit on your handlebars, scared for my life that you wouldn't be able to handle all the extra weight. I knew it was impossible that you could handle two of us and the bike. Impossible. Hell, you were smaller than me! And yet you did, pedaling hard, riding slowly, talking to me, comforting me, promising me you wouldn't crash. And keeping your word. As I would learn over the years you always did." 

 Shannon gave me a hug. "Give him a break, Teri. He really doesn't understand why the things he does matters. The idiot believes it's what men are supposed to do. He's even managed to con John into thinking the same." 

 John wasn't taking that lying down. "Don't lump me in with him. I only help when it's needed. He sees every tiny injustice as a personal challenge. If I didn't owe him, I'd let him handle most of the crap on his own." 

 Shannon laughed. "Bullshit, John Weber. How many hours did you spend on your own, rebuilding my piece of crap old car?" 

 "Piece of crap? It's a classic! I had to fix it. It just wasn't right." 

 Teri stood in front of me, then turned and straddled me, dropping her shirt to sit topless in my lap. She put her arms around my neck. "He's saved my bacon more than once." She kissed me softly. "That's why, Alex, you can do no wrong by me, and the sixth grader inside of me will love you until the day I die. You rescued a tired, scared and hurt little girl, and never asked anything in return." 

 I let her hug me, stroking her back gently. "I did ask something in return. I wanted to be your friend." 

 She laughed, almost hysterically. "You are such a fucking idiot! I had no friends. I was new. You GAVE me friendship, and brought me into your private inner circle. You heaped on the debt, with me owing you more and more, knowing I could never, ever repay you." 

 "You're being silly, Teri. You don't owe me anything. I helped you because I wanted to. I became friends with you because I liked you." 

 Teri turned to Shannon. "Head like a rock. Maybe you can explain it to him." 

 Shannon hugged me, giving me a kiss on the cheek. "She's right, Alex. You can't do one-way good deeds. You have to let us give back sometimes." 

 I turned back to Teri, wondering how my new girlfriends were taking all this. I pulled her away from me holding her at arm's length, gazing down at her naked torso. Her small breasts that fit her so well, hard little nipples begging for attention. "Can't you see that holding you here, now, like this, is worth far more than I could ever do for you? One of your kisses is payment enough for 10 years of good deeds." I pulled her in and kissed her deeply. "There that makes us even until you're thirty. Now you should get dressed and get off my lap before my girlfriends get jealous." 

 Lisa was getting a massage from John, and chose to speak up. "No jealousy here. How about you, Julie?" 

 "Not with Teri. She gets a pass. Always. She and Miss Shannon, right?" 

 "That's what I figure," the older sister said. 

 I chuckled, while Teri wiggled in my lap, hugging me even closer. "You better get up anyway. Much more of this, and I won't be responsible for you losing your cherry." 

 She nibbled on my ear. "It's yours. Right now if you want. I'd let you claim me in front of everybody." 

 I peeled her arms off of me, and held her pretty face in my hands, inches from my own. "I don't deserve you." I took her shirt, and straightened it out, putting it over her head. She maneuvered her arms into it, before climbing off my lap. 

 "I mean it, Alex. Whenever you want." 

 "I think that's a private discussion," I told her. 

 Julie piped up. "Uh-uh. Nothing behind our backs, you wouldn't do in front of us. That's the golden rule." 

 Dominique was sitting next to Shannon, but she got up to take Teri's place, glancing up at Julie. "Ok?" 

 "Sure," Julie giggled. "You're just getting him primed for later." 

 She leaned in to me, pulling her bra straps down to expose her smooth shoulders. "So let me see if I got this straight. You've rescued Teri, and Miss Shannon, and apparently John too, since he says he owes you, is that right?" 

 "Rescue's a strong word. I've helped them." I told her, massaging the back of her neck. 

 John barked a half-laugh. 

 "What about Julie and Lisa? Any good deeds there?" 

 Lisa laughed. "Two cold wet girls whose tents flooded. He shared his with us and took care of us." 

 "Come on," I argued. "That's not much of a good deed. What man wouldn't let you two into his tent, storm or not?" 

 "Ignore the idiot," Julie said. "He already had two girls in his sleeping bag, but he invited us in, dried us off, gave us his clothes and his sleeping bag and tried to sleep in this stupid blanket." 

 Lisa was switching places with Teri, who had John working her shoulders. "That's what got me, you know," she said, squeezing in next to Shannon. "Not the campfire, or even letting us in his tent. No. It was giving us the privacy of darkness to wear his shirt, and then making me sit down so he could dry my legs and feet, before telling me to get in his sleeping bag, and watching him fold that stupid blanket around himself by the door, so we could be comfortable." 

 Julie laughed. "I know, right? When he turned off that light, huddled by the door, I was going to kill him if he didn't get in the bag with us." She poked me. "It was so unfair. He did everything right. Spent twice as long making sure his tent was safe and sturdy. Set it up in the right spot. Bringing extra clothes, towels, blankets. Then giving it all to us, so we'd be warm and comfortable, while he tried to pretend a wet blanket and the cold floor was good enough for him. He didn't even have a shirt, after giving all of his to us." 

 Dominique turned to me, looking up, pressing her breasts against my leg. She definitely had my attention. "Backup. He already had two girls in his sleeping bag?" 

 Teri giggled. "Yep. Me and Heather. Poor Heather. She was scared to death to ask for help. She'd lied about their relationship and treated him like crap for a year, for no reason at all, and next thing you know she's standing at the entrance to his tent with me, soaked to the skin and freezing, begging for his help." 

 "You were hardly begging," I reminded her. 

 "I wasn't. I knew you'd take care of me. No matter what. She didn't. But he took us in, got us dried off, gave us dry shirts to wear, and shared his sleeping bag. We were frozen, and he just took us in his arms and held us until we were warm again. Never said a word about the past to Heather. He just held her. He had every right to kick her out and let her fend for herself, after the way she treated him. Instead he told her none of it mattered, and he held us both, while she broke down. 

 "We were almost naked in his sleeping bag, and he didn't do anything but hold us until we were warm again." 

 Dominique giggled. "Doesn't seem likely from the way y'all are behaving now." 

 Teri laughed. "HE didn't do anything. Heather and I decided some reward kissing and snuggling was in order. We were half way to ravaging him when those two showed up. I wanted to tell them to find their own friggin' tent, but the Boy Scout showed up, off to the rescue. Damn it." 

 Dominique leaned back against me, and my hands moved down her arms, and across the top of her chest, stopping at the material of her bra. I wasn't about to maul her tits, no matter how tempting they were. She was John's. Dammit. 

 "So everyone here is one of his rescues, except me. But I was rescued last night by John, which I guess makes me a rescue by proxy. Cool. I feel much better now." 

 That had the crowd giggling, but it also put the end to that massage while Julie switched places with her. 

 Shannon started in on another story while I concentrated on making Julie feel good. She had other ideas, turning and facing me, tucking her head into my side. "Rub my back now," she said. 

 The little vixen had her hand in my shorts, stroking and squeezing me, hidden by her body. It felt nice, but I was going to have to stop her if it went on much longer. 

 Dominique was straddling the log beside me, one leg pressed against my rear. I felt her hands move up to my shoulders, rubbing me. "Poor baby. All the good deeds, and all those massages, and nobody takes care of you?" she whispered into my ear. I felt her lips against my earlobe, and a gentle nibble. 

 This was bad. I turned to face Dominique, and her lips met mine. Just for a moment. She pulled back smiling. "Shhh." she whispered. "Just enjoy. You've earned it. I know I missed my chance." 

 I had no idea what Shannon was talking about after that. I was in my own little world, rubbing Julie's back while she played with my cock, Dominique rubbing my shoulders and neck, kissing my back. I was getting way too worked up. I lifted up Julie, gently moving her hand away from my shorts. "Kiss me, Angel," I told her. 

 She rose up on her knees, and kissed me hard. Dominique got up, giving me a little kiss on the neck, before going over to John and evicting Teri from her spot between his legs. 

 I took a short break after that to tend the fire, and provide drink refills, killing off the Bacardi. My shorts were tenting badly, but I wasn't concerned. The girls had certainly earned it. I ended up with Lisa back between my legs, topless, facing me, her breasts encasing my aching cock. 

 Shannon seemed to have no end to her stories, and things were just getting crazier as John broke out his contraband. A bottle of tequila, a salt shaker, and a squeeze lime. I served as a salt lick for whoever was beside me, before the tequila founds its way over. Lisa, Julie and even Teri were all being bad, playing with me when it was their turn in front of me. I wasn't paying attention to John, I could only hope he was having half as much fun. 

 I was as bad as the rest of them, openly fondling the girls I had access to. Even Shannon. When she took her turn for the massage, she kept her shirt on, a loose t-shirt. I grabbed the bottom of her shirt in back, and pulled it upward. 

 

 "Alex. What are you doing?" she said warningly. 

 I pulled it up and over her head, until her shoulders were exposed and her shirt was bunched up over her arms, doing a decent job of covering her chest. She leaned forward, still telling tales on me, while I rubbed her soft skin, letting my hands drift down and forward, cupping her breasts. 

 It was easy to see the booze was hitting her. She was talking slower, sometimes slurring her words. She was letting me fondle her openly, playing with her hard nipples. I'd have to watch out for her. Not enough to stop me from enjoying her. 

 When the tequila came around Julie leaned over, pressed Shannon's head forward and sprinkled the salt on the back of her neck. I licked it clean, my hands squeezing her breasts, her hard nipples held by my fingers, all hidden by the shirt and her position. 

 Lisa had the booze, took a swig of it, then tilted my head back and fed me my share from her mouth. 

 I was learning that Julie really was the instigator and wild child. She took the salt shaker she'd used on Shannon, pulled up the edge of my shorts and sprinkled the salt not an inch from my hard cock. 

 "Your shot, Miss Shannon." She leaned over and turned Shannon toward her, pushing her face down against my leg, my cock pressed against the side of her pretty face. Shannon licked me, more than once, her lips pressing against my skin edging closer to my shaft. 

 I looked over to see who was watching. John had Dominique sitting in his lap, straddling him, making out like there was no tomorrow. Teri, oddly enough was facing them, her arms around both. Lisa was watching me. She grinned and grabbed my chin, tilting my head back, holding the tequila bottle to my lips. "For Miss Shannon," she said, tilting it up. 

 Julie was holding the back of Shannon's head, pressing her into my crotch. Shannon's tongue had found its way inside my shorts leg, teasing the side of my cock. I reached down and moved her head back off of me, tilting her face up. I leaned down, placing my mouth over hers, slowly letting the tequila drain into her mouth. She swallowed, then her tongue reached out and licked my lips. 

 Julie was out of control. She dropped to her knees beside our teacher, and pulled my cock out into the air. 

 Shannon looked at it for a moment, then at our mischievous friend. "No baby. Not here. Not like this." 

 "One suck, and I'll put it away," Julie urged. 

 I almost died when Shannon lowered her mouth over my cock, taking me deep, before pulling off, and covering me up. "You are trouble, aren't you?" she asked Julie. 

 Julie giggled, leaning down and shocking all of us by pressing her lips against Shannon's. 

 It was too much. I could feel the tequila hitting me hard, and could only imagine how much it was effecting the girls. We were way out of control. And there were a dozen schoolmates not twenty feet away. 

 I fixed Shannon's shirt, looking into her glazed eyes. She was bombed. I lifted her up in my arms. "Come on, you. Bed time for everyone." 

 She leaned into my arms, hugging me. "I shouldn't, Alex." 

 "Tent. Now. All of us." 

 I held onto Shannon, while she swayed. Shit. I wasn't going to walk her through the crowd next door like this. I turned to Lisa and Julie. "I'm taking Shannon the long way, behind the shelters. I'll meet you at our tent. 

 I put my poncho over Shannon, a job in itself, and walked with her behind the shelters, back to my tent, getting soaked in the process. Julie and Lisa were waiting for me. I took my poncho back, and left Shannon with my new girlfriends, heading back to the fire to clean up. 

 The other three were still there, and I was more than a little surprised to see Teri sitting in John's lap kissing him. Dominique was beside them but she stood and walked to me, pulling my head down and kissing me like we were long lost lovers. She was tall, only a couple of inches shorter than me, and hugged me close. "Damn, you guys are wild. I had no idea." 

 I chuckled, kissing her softly. "Me neither. This is all new." 

 She reached between us, giving my cock a squeeze. "Are you fucking all of them?" 

 I shook my head. "Just the sisters." 

 "Who was number six, then, if not Teri or Miss Shannon? And none of that bullshit Julie was trying to feed me." 

 "Heather." 

 She kissed me again, her hand stroking me. "If you asked John, I bet we could all fit in your tent. It might be crowded but it could be a lot of fun." 

 "What's the deal with Teri?" I asked, deflecting the offer. 

 "I guess she's known him almost as long as you. Long stifled urges." She pouted. "I might be his fantasy, but she has her hooks in him deep, just like in you. You would have chosen her over the others, wouldn't you?" 

 "I don't know. Probably. There's a lot of history." 

 "Same with him. Poor baby came in his shorts when she kissed him." She sighed. "You either need to take her with you, or take me. And soon." 

 "God, Dominique. You're killing me. Do you know how long and badly I've wanted you?" 

 "No. That's the problem isn't it? If I'd known, it would be me riding you all night long, and not those devil sisters." 

 "But I've got two brand new girlfriends waiting, and you're with my best friend now." 

 She sighed, leaning into me. "I know." She held me while I looked over at my friends. "He really is a great guy." Teri was wriggling in John's lap, still kissing him, but she was watching me. 

 "I'm going to go get Teri now," I told Dominique. 

 "I know. We missed our chance. This is not a onetime offer, you know. If things should change between you and your playthings, keep me in mind, Ok?" 

 I was curious. "Why now, Dominique? Every other time I've tried to spend time with you, show you some attention, you completely shut down." 

 She blushed. "You're pretty intimidating, Alex. I don't suppose you know that. Your past, with all those women. Now I know that a lot of that was rumor, but I didn't know it before. I didn't want to be a notch on your belt. I don't have a ton of experience with guys, and the ones I've been with were...different. I was in control. I knew it wouldn't be like that with you. You were fascinating, but kind of scary. You made me so damn nervous." 

 "But not now?" 

 "No. Once I got to know you a little, and see how your girls are around you, I went from nervous to jealous, and now a little sad that I missed my chance. God, the more I learn about you, the more I could kick myself. Don't take me off your list. If anything changes..." 

 I kissed her again. "Count on it." I gave her one last hug. "I'm going to grab my stuff and get Teri. I'll leave you two alone." 

 She smiled at me, wistfully, and gave me a last kiss on the cheek. "Don't forget me," she said softly, turning back toward John. 

 I gave Teri a 'come here' gesture, and she peeled herself away from John, grinning. "Later, big guy," she said, and came skipping over to me like a little girl. 

 "You're being bad," I told her, pulling her into my arms. 

 "Not really. We're just playing." 

 "You've got Dominique jealous." 

 She looked surprised. "Really? How cool is that!" 

 I gave her a swat on the rear. "Not cool at all, Trouble." 

 She pouted. "Party pooper. We going to your tent to play now?" 

 "After we pick up." 

 She rolled her eyes. "You've always got to be so damn responsible, don't you." 

 "C'mon. It'll take us two minutes, and then we have the whole night ahead of us." 

 I lied. It took us closer to 10 minutes to gather up the mugs, empty the coffee pots, gather up the blanket, and knock down the fire. It was till raining, but lightly, and there was almost no wind to contend with. 

 John and Dominique left for his tent while we were cleaning up. I really hoped things worked out for them, but I didn't have high hopes. Not the way she'd been behaving. "Later, you and I are gonna talk," I told Teri, as we left the fire. 

 "About John?" she asked. 

 "Yep." 

 I passed by Max and Wendy. She was sitting in his lap while they chatted. "The other shelter's empty," I told him. "For that matter, looks like the worst of the storm is over. Your tent might be an even better choice." Report_Story #5

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 04 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© ====================== 

 Sisters, Teacher and Best Friend. Jealous? 

 Sometimes, I'm a big ol' idiot. I don't use an editor often enough, but MarieWriter helped with this series, and it's considerably better for her assistance. I should have mentioned that in the first chapter, where she provided a lot of insightful advice. Of course, I'm never happy with the story and keep tweaking until the last minute. I assure you, any errors are mine, not hers. 

 ====================== 

 I stood in the vestibule of my tent, holding Teri's hand, still stunned by my incredible luck, and wondering what was in store for me under the canvas. 

 I passed Teri a towel. "Let's get rid of most of these clothes out here, so we don't bring the storm in with us." 

 I stripped down to my shorts before entering the tent, while Teri took off everything but her underwear. We toweled off, and I gave her a quick hug and kiss, before opening the zipper and heading in. I had quite the surprise waiting. All three girls were naked, with Shannon lying on my sleeping bag between the sisters. 

 "Are we the best girlfriends ever?" Julie asked. "Look what we have for you. A beautiful naked teacher, all primed and ready to go." 

 I could see that Julie had her hand between Shannon's legs, and Lisa was playing with her tits. 

 "Alex," Shannon greeted me, slurring her words, "your girls are being so bad." 

 "Julie, what are you doing?" I asked her softly, kneeling down beside her. 

 "Getting her ready for you. You don't get us, until you do her first." 

 I was torn. This wasn't what I'd expected, but then again, nothing this weekend had worked out the way I'd supposed. I felt hands around my hips and looked over my shoulder to see a naked Teri pulling down my shorts. "It's Ok, Alex. Everyone can see how you two are with each other. It's just us. Nobody has to ever know." 

 Shannon might have been drunk, but she wasn't completely gone. "You all have to promise. Nobody can know," she said. "Promise?" 

 Julie leaned over and kissed her. "We promise. It's our secret. Forever." 

 Shannon looked at Teri. "Promise?" 

 Teri surprised me for the umpteenth time tonight by leaning over Shannon and kissing her softly. "I promise. I'd love to see you with him, if just this once." 

 Shannon turned her head to Lisa, for another, deeper kiss. "I promise too," Lisa said. 

 Shannon opened her legs, looking at me. I moved between them. "I'm so worked up now, I won't last 10 seconds," I warned her. 

 She grinned, struggling up to a seated position. "I'm going to suck you dry, then you can do me, Ok?" 

 I think I liked drunk Shannon. 

 The girls pulled me to the ground, gathering around, and then Shannon was between my legs, holding my cock in her hand, looking at it. "I've wanted this for so long, Alex. Why did you make me wait?" 

 "I wanted to graduate first, so we wouldn't risk your job. Next summer I was going to fuck your pretty brains out." 

 She gave my cock a lick. "I guess we'll just have to get started early." She looked around, "It's our secret right?" 

 Everyone nodded, watching while her sexy mouth lowered over my cock. She bobbed her head up and down slowly a few times, then lifted up, sucking hard, and pulled off me with an audible pop. "Is that what you wanted, you naughty boy? Sticking your hard prick in your teacher's nasty mouth? 

 "God, I'm so close Shannon. Suck me off, please." 

 It didn't take a lot of time or finesse. She smiled and took me in her mouth, moving her head up and down steadily. She watched me the whole time, only using her mouth. It wasn't a minute before I warned her of my release. "Now," I groaned, thrusting up into her mouth, and releasing my soul between those amazing lips. 

 I came hard, shooting over and over, each time I thought I was finished another burst shooting outward. She kept me in her mouth, letting me finish then sat back on her heels, opening her mouth for us, showing it coated from top to bottom with my cream. She crooked her fingers toward Julie and Lisa, beckoning them closer. The girls moved toward her, and she pulled Julie close, pressing her lips to her, sharing my cum. She pulled back, a sticky string stretching between their lips, turning to Lisa. Lisa went to her eagerly, and they kissed for an eternity, before Shannon pulled away. She closed her mouth, swallowing, then opened it for me, showing empty. She smiled at the sisters. "See? I can share too." 

 Teri was on her hands and knees, over my waist. She looked up at Lisa. "Can I get him ready for her?" 

 Lisa nodded. "Sure. But that's all for now, Ok?" 

 Teri didn't answer. She started working on my cock, licking and kissing it. I watched as Shannon moved over next to Julie, putting her arm around my girlfriend's waist. "Aren't you even a little jealous?" she asked. 

 Julie grinned. "Nope. He could have had her. Could have had any one of them. He chose me. Me." She turned and pressed her lips to Shannon's, kissing her deeply. "I'm never going to let him regret that choice." 

 I was already hard in Teri's generous mouth, but I wasn't about to stop her. It was too fun watching my friend of so many years enjoy herself. 

 Lisa noticed. "I think he's ready," she observed. 

 Shannon leaned over and ran her hand down Teri's bare back, all the way to her sweet little ass. "Let her play a bit. I think he'll last a while now." She turned to me. "You're going to last for me, aren't you Alex?" 

 "I swear, this thing isn't going down until dawn. Not with you guys here." 

 We gave Teri a couple more minutes. It was nice, filling her mouth, watching her play, sucking, licking, kissing. In a way it was good she didn't know what she was doing, I was hard, but I wasn't really getting worked up. I'm sure Shannon would have had me on my third erection by now. 

 Shannon lay down beside me, sighing sweetly. "Whenever you want me lover, I'm here for you." 

 I reached down and lifted Teri's face off my cock. "Thanks beautiful. That was nice." 

 She pouted. "Nice? I was going for incredible." 

 I laughed. "Maybe if you're good, the girls will allow you some more practice. I'm sure you can be incredible." 

 I got up and moved between Shannon's legs, pausing to listen to the rain and the murmur of the last of the evening's revelers. I lifted her legs, pulling them back toward her head. Julie and Lisa were kneeling on each side of her, watching. I looked at them, "Hold these, will you?" 

 The girls took Shannon's legs, tilting them back. "Gently," Shannon warned, "I'm not as flexible as you young things." 

 She was wide open for me, a pretty little field of red hair above her open pussy. I lay down between her legs, lowering my mouth to her moist lips. 

 "Oh, God, Alex," she moaned. "Eat me." 

 I did my best, putting all I'd learned one special weekend at the beach into play. She was moaning from the beginning, and it didn't take me too long to get her to come for me. 

 She was a moaner, pretty quiet otherwise. When she came, the moans rose in pitch, quieting afterward. She was consistent about that, as I made her come on my tongue twice. The third time, when her moans had nearly reached the perfect pitch, I rose up and thrust my aching cock into her, to the hilt, pushing her immediately over the edge, and making her come hard on my cock. Lisa leaned over me, caressing my side, her hand wandering down to my ass, squeezing my butt cheek. 

 "Did you like eating her out?" she asked, while I drove my cock in and out of our teacher with a nice leisurely pace, enjoying myself. 

 "I loved it. Making her come like that." 

 She kissed my shoulder. "You'll do that for us, right?" 

 I chuckled. "Until you beg me to stop." 

 "Mmm. That might take a while. There are two of us, you know." 

 "Lisa, I'm dying to taste your sweet little pussy." 

 "Let her legs go," I told my accomplices in the ravishing of our teacher. 

 They did, and Shannon stretched her legs out, then wrapped them around me. I leaned over her, bringing my face down to hers. "I could do this forever," I told her softly, kissing her briefly. 

 She grinned. "That wouldn't be fair to our friends. Half of forever will do." 

 I was feeling strong, in no hurry to finish. And I wanted to play. 

 I pulled out of her, rolling her over, and lifting her hips high. She rose up on her hands, looking back at me. "Like this, lover?" 

 "Exactly like this," I told her, sliding back inside her warmth. 

 Julie shuffled over on her knees, looking down at where I was sliding in and out of our teacher. "God that looks sexy," she said, reaching between us, her fingers bracketing where my cock was entering Shannon. 

 "Kiss me?" I asked. 

 She grinned and brought her lips to mine, kissing me warmly, our tongues playing, while I fucked Shannon. Lisa moved in on my other side, tapping her sister. "Share?" 

 Julie pulled back, grinning. "Always, with you sissy." 

 I turned and kissed Lisa, for a long, long time almost missing it when Shannon's moans started rising. I pulled back from Lisa, grabbed Shannon's hips and hammered her. She came for me sweetly, gasping, and dropping her head to the ground, that sweet pussy of hers still held high for me. 

 I looked around for Teri, who was laying on her side, watching us, her hand between her legs. I blew her a kiss, and she grabbed it out of the air, and placed it between her legs, moaning loudly, then winking at me. God, this was a part of her I'd never have imagined. 

 Shannon sighed, pulling away from me. "Let me watch you with them, Alex. Please." She rolled onto her side, looking devastating. 

 I looked back and forth between Lisa and Julie. "Shall we?" 

 Lisa nodded. "Lie down." 

 I did, stretching out, eager to start. Lisa turned to her sister. "You go first." 

 "Are you sure?" Julie asked, straddling me. 

 Lisa nodded. "I want to feel his tongue." 

 She straddled my head, lowering herself. I held her by the hips, adjusting her, until I had room to work. I was right. She did have a sweet pussy. I felt Julie lower herself onto my cock, her tightness driving me crazy. 

 I spent several minutes under the two of them, before they traded places. Same blonde peach-fuzz, same narrow inner lips, same hard little clit. I couldn't tell one from the other, not by look or taste. Lisa rode my cock a little harder, and was easier to drive into. Funny that my cock could recognize the difference. 

 I was starting to feel that change in urgency, when they switched back again. They didn't talk, one minute they'd be straddling me, then they'd be switching. The brief switch helped reduce my need. 

 They were playing with me, switching more often, only a couple of minutes each time. I was losing track, even my cock was getting confused. I felt the sister on my face starting to squirm against my tongue, and I worked hard to try to get her off before the next switch. I wasn't successful, but I was getting to both of them finally. The next pussy was in the same state of eagerness, trembling against my tongue. 

 After the next switch, I pulled her hips down and sucked hard around her clit, pressing forward with my tongue. I was rewarded with two hands gripping my hair and pushing back, while she shuddered her release. 

 The girl at my waist was fucking me hard, and I thrust up against her, groaning, gasping for air. The pussy over my face drew away, but the one down below kept working. I looked down and saw Julie, eyes closed, forehead wrinkled in concentration, while she rode me. 

 I reached for her, pulling her down to my chest. Her eyes burst open staring at me. I lifted her hips up and jackhammered that tight little pussy, until she squealed for me coming so very sweetly. 

 Lisa lay down beside me, watching. "Fuck her hard, Alex. Pound that poor tight little pussy to pieces." 

 I was straining from the exertion, but I kept pounding into her, listening to her sweet little moans and gasps. I recalled the night before when she'd gone multi-orgasmic on me. "Come on my cock, Julie. Come for me." 

 She cried out, shuddering, gasping, then cried out again, "Fuck," she groaned. 

 Lisa whispered, "Not inside her, she's not on the pill yet." 

 I moaned, pounding her with long strokes, feeling that small sexy body tense up, before trembling with ecstasy. 

 "I'm going to cum," I gasped to Lisa. 

 Lisa moved down and indelicately pushed her sister off me, taking my cock in her mouth. I held her head, thrusting into her hot mouth for a few more strokes before erupting. She swallowed gamely, sucking me dry, before pulling away. 

 "Lisa!" Julie whined, "Where's my share?" 

 Lisa grinned. "Next one's yours, Ok?" 

 That seemed to console her. "Alright, but don't forget." 

 I looked over to the side and saw Shannon was sleeping. "I guess we were too boring for her." 

 Teri giggled. "Are you kidding? That was better than porn. You guys fucked the shit out of him." 

 Lisa grinned, grabbing my cock and shaking it. "You want to get him ready for us?" 

 "Can I?" 

 "Please, have fun." 

 Teri was looking for some fun of her own. She straddled me in 69, peeking back over her shoulder at me. "Do you mind?" she asked. 

 "I'd love to taste you, Bestie." 

 It was wonderful. We just played with each other, licking, tasting and sucking. Lisa peeked over Teri's ass. "Hey Alex, you got anything to drink in here? I'm really thirsty." 

 I took a break from licking Teri. "Sorry. Nothing." 

 She pouted. "Where can we get something?" 

 "I'll get us some water," I told her. "Teri, can we take a little break?" 

 Teri rose up, grinning. "No hurry. As long as we can play later." 

 Lisa gave her a hug. "All the oral you want. I promise. Just no sex, right Alex?" 

 "That's it. She stays a virgin," I confirmed. 

 Teri sat up, hand stroking my cock. "Works for me. You guys are the best." 

 Julie piped up. "That's the plan. Best girlfriends ever. He'll never be able to leave us. Who else would be willing to share with someone like you or Miss Shannon?" 

 I threw on shorts, and headed into the night. I had my coffee pot with me, planning to fill it with water. The camp had completely died down, and things were pretty quiet. I noticed that some of the sleeping bags were intimately close, but I kept my distance, not wanting to interfere with budding romance. 

 I walked through the second shelter, where we'd spent such an interesting evening, finding it empty. I figured that Max may have convinced Wendy to join him in his tent after all. 

 The third shelter held the picnic tables, and the foodstuff that had been moved from the last shelter before the storm. The huge water cooler was there, as I'd hoped, and it only took me a few moments to fill my pot. 

 I had an urge to check all the tarps, just in case, and to work on the fires, but I forced that urge down. Enough Boy Scout for the evening. I had more serious business ahead of me. Two sisters that I was going to do my damnedest to wear out, before they broke me. 

 Back in the tent, I was welcomed with a naked parade of firm teenage flesh. We filled up a mug and passed it around, twice, to slake our thirst. "It was that damned tequila," Lisa said. 

 The girls had opened up one of the extra sleeping bags, and covering our sleeping teacher with it. I went to check on her. She was sleeping soundly, and I couldn't resist leaning over and giving her a little kiss goodnight. 

 Julie showed up next to me. "If you want we can wake her up." 

 "Let her sleep. You and your sister are more than enough for me." 

 She giggled. "Let's just play a while. Get to know each other, a little like last night." 

 Her idea was for us to relax in the dark, kissing, hugging, touching, fondling, all that good stuff. She even thought Teri should play along. 

 We killed the flashlight, and played. There was no attempt to hide who was who, the dark just made everything a little more intense. I spent a good amount of my time playing with the 4 Samuelson tits, which I doubted I'd ever get enough of. Every time I moved to a new one, I seemed to earn a chuckle. "You really do like our tits, don't you?" Lisa asked as I moved from one tasty nipple to the other. 

 "They are perfect. The best in the school. Best I've ever seen." 

 "Ellen's are a lot bigger," Julie said, offering me hers. 

 I teased her nipple hard. "Bigger isn't better beyond a certain point. Your bodies are both so amazing, soft, curvy, firm, smooth, it's almost beyond belief." 

 "What about Teri?" Lisa asked. "What do you like about her?" 

 "I love her tits, on her. They fit her. And she has the most incredible ass and legs. I love to watch her walk away from me." 

 I got a squeeze from beside me. "You really like my ass? It's not too big?" 

 "Are you kidding? It's maddening how sweet your ass and legs are. When I used to beat off to thoughts of you every night, I was almost always thinking of that perfect butt." 

 "You masturbated thinking of me?" she asked. 

 "Non-stop from 7th to 10th grade. I've come for you thousands of times." 

 She sighed, reaching down and squeezing my cock. "Damn, Alex. You have to stop telling me things like that. My pussy is flooding and the urge to cram that huge cock of yours into my virgin pussy is driving me crazy." 

 Julie must have been behind her, at least that's where her voice came from. "So fuck him already. You both want to. It's your stupid rules keeping you apart. I'll give you a free pass." 

 I turned toward her, feeling Lisa cuddle up behind me. I leaned down and kissed my longtime friend. "We can wait 'til you're ready. There is no rush, Teri. We can have lots of fun, without making you go that far." 

 I reached down for her breast, and found Julie latched on to it. The girl was a never ending supply of surprises. 

 Teri moaned slightly. "I just want it to be special." 

 Lisa giggled. "More special than this? None of us are ever going to forget this weekend. Ever. Julie, was it special for you?" 

 "Oh my God! To have you here with me, and my fantasy man doing it, in the dark with everyone touching me, unbelievable. My dream boyfriend took my cherry, and I got to share it with you." She sighed. "It was so incredible. Later, when Miss Shannon and I shared him, just the two of us, and he gave me my first sex orgasm, and then later, a dozen more, I could have died and gone to heaven. Shannon was so sweet, helping me get that first one, and telling me it was Ok that it was uncomfortable at first, that he was big, it wasn't just me. I could just eat her up." 

 Julie had let the cat out of the bag. "You screwed Miss Shannon last night?" Teri asked. 

 "It surprised the hell out of me. I was freezing to death when I got back from fixing up the camp for everyone. Only Lisa and Julie were up. Lisa, you drifted off, while Julie tried to warm me up, lying on top of me. Shannon woke up and cuddled in next to me to help warm me up. She was topless. So I held her and we talked about the camp." 

 Julie giggled. "He was freezing. Teeth chattering, body trembling, the whole works. His normally great big cock was a little tiny cold Vienna sausage hiding from me. Then he kissed her and I swear he grew to full size in less time than I can say it. He really liked kissing her." 

 I laughed. "I did. I like kissing her. But then wild thing thought it would be a good idea to put my cock to more intimate use, right there in front of Shannon." 

 Julie chuckled. "She called me 'Heaven'. I only got to do him for a few minutes before he asked me to switch places with her. I couldn't believe he was going to do her right there, with me watching." 

 "Pretty good, huh?" Lisa asked. "Nailing the teacher." 

 "Hell, I've wanted her since I brought her home the first time. We almost did it once, a long time ago, but stopped. I knew I wouldn't be able to handle seeing her in school every day and not give it away. We've been flirting ever since. Every once in a while I'll steal a little kiss, but not like last night." Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 04 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© "He did us both," Julie giggled, "taking turns. How cool was that? Sharing him with her. He made her come for him, and then he fucked my brains out, making me come so much I thought I was going to die. And she helped me get that first one, playing with my clitty, while he pounded me into the ground. I don't know how long he fucked her after that. I fell asleep and twice woke up to him still screwing her." 

 "You guys didn't act like you'd been doing it, when you were around the fire," Teri said. 

 "I think we've been around each other long enough now, that we can keep it separated from our public life. At least I hope so." 

 Lisa had her hand around my stiff cock, stroking it. "Fuck her again for us, Alex?" 

 "She's sleeping." 

 "I know I'd love to be woken up by your big dick plowing me," Lisa argued. 

 Julie liked the idea. "Let's do it, Alex. Let's fuck her again." 

 "She'll love it. To think you can't resist her, even with these two here." Teri said. "I know I would. That would be special. Losing my virginity to you because you couldn't resist having me, even sleeping, with these two here. God, I almost came just imagining it." She moaned. "I'm half asleep, and I wake to you kissing me. I feel you between my legs, pushing yourself in. I'm groaning, feeling its thickness, a sharp pinch when you steal my virginity, then that wonderful cock filling me. You're holding me, that hunk of meat sliding out, and then pushing all the way in, filling me completely, bottoming out. 'I couldn't wait a moment longer', you tell me. 'I had to have you'. Now that would be spectacular." 

 I had to laugh. "No, that would be rape. Fucking a sleeping virgin." 

 She pulled me down for a kiss. "You can't rape the willing." 

 Julie wasn't having any of it. "Suck him Teri. Make sure he's hard and wet. We're fucking Miss Shannon." 

 I felt like a bastard, but I let them talk me into it. We uncovered Shannon and opened her legs. She mumbled a bit, but seemed relaxed. Teri was on her hands and knees sucking me sloppily. I pushed her away and pressed the head of my cock into Shannon's pussy, moving it up and down until she opened for me. I pushed the head in and leaned over her, watching her beautiful face, as I eased the full length of my cock into her. 

 She didn't wake up immediately. She gave a soft little moan somewhere around the 4th or 5th stroke. I long-stroked her gently, and leaned down for a kiss. Her eyes fluttered, and slowly opened. She smiled so sweetly it broke my heart. "Mmm, that's nice," she said softly, closing her eyes. 

 I stroked her harder, making her perfect tits jiggle. She wiggled underneath me, pushing back against me. "God, that's good. I wish I could wake up like this every day of my life." 

 Lisa poked me. "See? I told you she'd love it." 

 Julie squeezed in between us, and kissed her. "You're gorgeous when you're sleeping." 

 Shannon's eyes opened, slowly focusing on Julie. "What time is it?" 

 Julie kissed her again. "It's still the middle of the night. You can go back to sleep if you like." 

 Shannon sighed, "You couldn't resist me, could you, Alex? Not even with our little wild thing here." 

 Teri giggled. "Told you so." 

 I leaned in and kissed her, fighting with Julie for access to Shannon's luscious lips. "Who could resist you? I just had to have a little taste. I couldn't wait until morning." 

 Shannon grinned, "Anytime you want, lover. I'm yours." 

 Julie moved down and started sucking on Shannon's tit. It wasn't long before Lisa was latched on to the other one. Shannon moaned sexily. "Your girlfriends are naughty, Alex." 

 "Just relax, Shannon. Sleep if you want to. We'll only play with you for a little while." 

 "God, you're all so bad. Playing with me. Using me. Fucking me." I could barely hear her as she muttered. "Am I dreaming?" she asked. 

 I was on my knees, holding her legs up, and fucking her harder. "You're in my dream," I told her. 

 Teri was still a bystander. "Kiss her, Teri. Get involved," I told her. 

 Teri climbed up next to Julie, and leaned over Shannon, hiding her face from my view. All I could see above her belly was my girls covering my teacher. Leaving that sweet pussy, the object of so many fantasies, to me. 

 I watched my cock entering her, plunging into her over and over again. The view was intense, and ridiculously exciting. I fucked her harder, feeling her move under me. I was only going to play, but now I knew that I had to finish inside her. 

 I tilted her legs back and drove down into her. The feeling was exquisite. Too intense to hold back. I groaned my need, "I'm going to come," I announced, moments before exploding deep inside her. I kept stroking into her, pumping out all I had, hating the thought of ever pulling out of her. 

 Teri was the first to back away, giving her a last kiss. "Good night, Miss Shannon," she said. 

 Julie took her place, kissing her for a while. "Thanks for that. Sweet dreams." 

 Lisa gave her a kiss as well, "We love you Miss Shannon. We all love you. You're the best." 

 I pushed my semi-hard cock into her, and leaned down for a goodnight kiss of my own. "You were wonderful. Thank you." 

 She grinned, her eyes still closed. "Thank you, Alex. That was the best dream I ever had." 

 I still couldn't stand the idea of pulling out of her. I eased in and out, kissing her gently. I concentrated on the feeling, and who I was doing. Slowly, I felt some stiffness return. Not complete but enough to move inside of her. 

 "More?" she asked smiling sweetly. 

 "Just a little, if it's Ok," I said grinding into her, letting her warm tightness breathe life into my cock. 

 She opened her eyes and lifted her arms. "Hold me, Alex." 

 I laid down on her, wrapping her in my arms. I felt a hand touching me where I entered her. 

 "Kiss me," she asked. 

 I pressed my lips to her, exploring her mouth with my tongue. She started moaning for me, softly at first. I picked up the pace a bit, pushing deeper, getting that beautiful reaction from her, the escalating moaning, pulling her mouth off mine and gasping, fingers digging into my back. Teri lay down next to her, brushing Shannon's wild red hair back. "It's Ok, Miss Shannon," she whispered. "Come for him. Come for us. Come for me. Let me see what it's like to be with him." 

 Shannon reached out for her, hugging her tightly. "So good, baby. So good." 

 Enough gentleness. I rose up on my hands, fucking her hard. She groaned, and the moans started up again, after Teri's interruption. Lisa was over my shoulder, caressing me. "Finish her, Alex. Give it to her." 

 I grabbed Shannon's shoulders, and hammered that forbidden pussy, finally wrenching a beautiful orgasm out of her, feeling her body tense up, her moans peaking. I slowed down, moving gently inside her, while she caught her breath, slowly relaxing. 

 I stopped, kissing her gently. "Thank you," I told her softly. 

 She smiled, stretching sweetly. "Mmm, you're spoiling me." 

 I chuckled. "I'm going to spoil you a lot more, you know that right?" 

 She nodded, her eyes closed. "Counting on it. Now play with your girls." 

 I gave her a last peck, rolling off of her onto my back. I wasn't exposed for more than a few seconds before Julie was sucking my cock. 

 She lifted her head, grinning at me. "I can taste her on you." 

 I reached down, and pulled her up my body, getting a cute little squeal for my efforts. I kissed her, and felt her sliding my cock into her tight young pussy. 

 

 "Did she taste good?" I asked. 

 "Mmm. So hot, knowing it was her juices on you." 

 "You like girls?" I asked. 

 She wriggled on my cock. "I don't know. It's all new, you know. I like Teri and Shannon. Kissing is cool, and getting to play with their boobs is a lot of fun. I like that a lot." She lifted her hips, and settled down on my cock, taking almost the full length. "I like this more." 

 "You liked tasting her. Do you think you'd like tasting it directly?" 

 She gave me a kiss. "Kind of scary, you know? That's different." 

 Teri was lying beside me, quietly watching our interplay. I looked at her, while Julie rode me gently. "You are the surprise of the night," I told my longtime friend, pulling her close for a kiss. "I love that saucy mouth of yours." 

 She grinned. "How about a little taste now?" 

 "I'd love it." 

 She moved down between my legs, and I lifted Julie's hips high, releasing my cock. I felt Teri's mouth engulf me, sucking me so nicely, before easing my cock back into my girlfriend. I thrust into Julie, and she moaned. 

 "She's touching me," Julie whispered. 

 "Like it?" 

 "MmmHmm," she moaned, holding me. 

 I reached down and grabbed her tight little ass cheeks, spreading them open. I thrust into her, and held her still, filled with my cock. It was perfect for me, taking the edge off. 

 "Oh God," she groaned, and I felt Teri's hands covering my own. "She's licking me back there," Julie whispered. 

 "Ok?" 

 "God, yes," she moaned. "She's going to make me come." 

 I started pushing into her, just a little, keeping her impaled, while Teri played with her. 

 "Oh fuck! Oh FUCK!" she cried out, grinding against me. 

 Lisa was sitting next to us, giggling. "You like that, Jules?" 

 "Oh God, Fuck me Alex. Now, hard," she gasped. 

 I lifted her hips, driving into her fast and deep. Lisa moved closer, her face close to mine. "Two fingers in her bottom," she whispered. 

 Julie hunched over, whimpering, before suddenly crying out. I felt her pussy clenching down on my cock. I kept pumping her, through her orgasm, feeling that change in her as she came off her high. She was gasping, shaking, looking at me with eyes open in wonder. Julie's mouth opened, no sound coming out, as she came for me again, hard. It seemed to last forever. It was working me up, to my own finish. 

 I long-stroked her, bottoming out on each deep thrust, her body rocking with each new movement. Lisa reached in and grabbed her sister's tits, giving her nipples a hard squeeze. 

 Julie went wild, fucking back against me hard, wrenching her ass free from my hands, pounding down against me. She gasped, and I felt her trembling again, and again, until she slammed down on me, crying out once more. 

 She was gasping for air, noisily, "Too much," she moaned. 

 I lifted her up bodily, putting her on her back, and climbing back between her legs, driving into her with one hard stroke, and pounding her with all I had left. 

 I loved the way she came so easily, once she was worked up. I knew I couldn't last much longer, and somehow managed to remember I wasn't supposed to come in her. 

 I reached out for Teri, grabbing her head, and pulling her down to where I was connected to the wild one. Julie was coming for me in delightful spasms, wordless cries escaping her. It was too much. I pulled out of her, and pushed Teri's face over my cock. She took it eagerly, let me stroke into her mouth, aggressively, making her gag, until I could hold back no longer, letting loose inside her teasing mouth. 

 Immediately, I felt guilty for using Teri like that. She was sucking me clean, and I pulled her up off my cock. I lifted her to her knees, kissing her softly. "Sorry, I didn't mean to be so rough." 

 She grinned. "Am I incredible yet?" 

 "Jesus, yes! Better than my fantasies." 

 She kissed me hard, the taste of own cum strong on her lips. "Good. Use me however you need. That was amazing." 

 Lisa walked up to me on her knees. "I'm starting to feel a little left out," she pouted. 

 I looked down at her sister, who was lying helpless and used up. "That's silly. This was all just a prelude to the main act." I nodded at Julie. "Let's tuck her in with Shannon, before you and I get down to business." 

 Her smile was brilliant. "Promise?" 

 "Absolutely." 

 I lifted up Julie, and Lisa drew back the cover off Shannon. I laid the tiny teen down next to our teacher, pulling Shannon's arm around her, before covering them up. 

 "Was this your plan? Wear us out, one by one?" Lisa teased. 

 "I don't want to wear you out. I want to love you until dawn," I told her, kissing her softly, my tongue brushing against hers. 

 The flashlight we'd attached to the overhead cord was dimming, but it had served its purpose. "I think that's enough of the craziness for a while. I'm going to turn that out, and lay with you two for a minute, like the first night." 

 I reached up, removing the light from the string. I opened up the big sleeping bag, which had served as a mattress for us so far, lay down inside it and brought both of my girls in to my arms. With everything much saner, I turned out the light, dropping it behind my head. It was pretty much shot anyway. 

 Lisa kissed my shoulder. "You look like you're worn out. That was pretty crazy what you did to Julie." 

 "Not at all. It's just that the craziness isn't what I need right now. I just want to hold you, touch you, feel you against me. This is all so incredible. You here with me? Unbelievable. I just need to experience it for a while." 

 "Any more incredible than doing our teacher?" she teased. 

 "Different. I knew that I'd have her someday, just as I knew for a while that I'd probably be having your sister. But you two? Either one of you is beyond belief. Having both of you here with me, like this? Forget the sex for a moment. Just this, naked, alone, touching, kissing, it's totally and completely beyond even my best fantasies." 

 I kissed Lisa firmly, my hand caressing her. "You were out of reach. Too much to hope for. The hottest girl in school, and always taken." 

 She giggled sweetly. "I'm not the hottest girl in school." 

 "What are you, nuts? Of course you are. Tell her, Teri." 

 Teri chuckled. "Gotta be top two or three. It's hard to pick just one. But she'd be on anyone's list. That body? Are you fucking kidding me?" 

 Lisa was rubbing me gently between my legs, keeping my cock, if not hard, thick and substantial. "This is pretty fantastic, isn't it? This, here, now. Us." 

 I was enjoying the fondling. I knew that before long, I'd be putting it to her again, but for the moment, I wanted the intimacy. "Fantastic is a nice word for it." 

 Lisa leaned across me, her hand reaching for Teri. "Are you having fun, Teri? I know this is all kind of crazy. Not what I expected when I thought you should join us." 

 Teri giggled. "And what were you expecting?" 

 Lisa sighed, resting her head on my shoulder. "Something totally different." 

 I kissed her forehead. "Share?" 

 She chuckled. "I guess I thought it would be me and Julie here in the bag with you, with Miss Shannon and Teri looking on. You'd take turns with me and my sister, while they watched. More voyeuristic, I guess. Less hands-on." 

 I hugged her to me. "Kind of what I was expecting," I told her softly. "More intimate than what happened." 

 "Me too. I thought I'd be in for a show. Not the designated fluffer," Teri added. 

 "Fluffer? How do you even know about things like that, little Miss Innocent?" I teased. 

 "I thought you had a thing for smart girls?" she responded. I felt her hand join Lisa's on my cock, getting a little more of a rise out of it. 

 "I have a thing for this one." 

 She kissed me on the neck. "Can I say something?" she asked hesitantly. 

 "Of course." 

 "It's not always like this, is it? I mean, I really like playing with your thing. It's so cool to hold it, taste it, see what it does, feel how you react. But the way you pound these girls with it, what you did to Julie, it's kind of scary." 

 Lisa laughed. "No, it's not like this. Not in my experience." 

 Teri sighed. "Thank God. I'd be scared to death to let him have me. I honestly think I'd dislocate a hip or something. I wouldn't be able to walk for weeks." 

 "Now you're being silly," I told her. "Don't you remember last night? The way I was with Julie? Slow and gentle is the key for the first time." 

 "I figured that might have been because of the situation." 

 I pulled her chin up and kissed her gently. "No. I'm not a beast." 

 Teri was obviously still curious. "What was your first time like, Lisa?" 

 "Nothing to write home about. After a couple of months of fooling around, and getting fingered plenty, when we finally decided to do it, it took a few minutes to get it inside, and a few seconds before it was done and wilting." She giggled. "I thought two minutes was all I could expect." 

 She climbed on top of me, relaxing in my arms. "To be fair it wasn't always like that. Darrell was a little better, and he'd at least get me off with his hands now and then. And a few times he was up to the task, giving me a few minutes before popping. I never came on a cock before this one, though." 

 "What's it like?" Teri asked, softly. 

 Lisa leaned over and kissed Teri. "Beautiful. Really. Someday you'll see. Feeling so full, and wanted. That crazy feeling building up inside, nothing like doing it to myself. God, it's nice." She turned back to me, kissing my lips gently. "Make me feel like that again, Alex?" 

 "I'd love to." 

 She sat up, and reached between her legs, slowly sliding me inside of her. "This, right now, you've got to try it, Teri. Feeling him open me up, his thick shaft stretching me so deliciously. The full feeling when it's finally inside. Moving a little until the fit is a perfect match, knowing that my little pussy is encasing his entire cock." She settled down on me, wriggling her hips a bit. "There. Now. I can feel the pressure on the back of my pussy. If he was even half an inch longer, I couldn't take it all. It's on the verge of uncomfortable, so big, so thick, filling me completely. Like it was made just for me. God, Teri, it's amazing." 

 She rose up, until I was barely inside her. "You can pull out, and feel it all over again, the slow filling, the feel of him rubbing my insides. Slow, like this," she murmured, taking her time riding my full length. She giggled. "Until he can't take the teasing, and hammers it home." 

 I took the hint, held her hips, and drove my cock into her, making her grunt. "Shit," she gasped. "Mind blowing. Knowing how bad he wants me." 

 "How would you do me, Alex? My first time." Teri asked. 

 I pulled Lisa down and kissed her softly. "Ok if I show her? With you?" 

 Lisa kissed me back. "I'll be a virgin for you. Show us both what it could be like." 

 I rolled over with her, putting her on her back. "I'm no expert, of course, but first of all, we spend a lot of time getting you worked up," I said to my lovely audience of two. I leaned over Lisa, kissing her warmly, my tongue exploring her mouth, taking my time. I kissed her all over her pretty face. "I can't believe this is happening," I told Lisa softly. "I want this to be perfect. Talk to me. Let me know if I do anything wrong. Share with me what you like." 

 I moved down her body, nibbling her ears, tasting her neck, pressing my lips against her collar bone. My hands were in motion, gliding across her skin, caressing gently, learning her. 

 My southward journey paused at her breasts, letting me enjoy them the way I had wanted to the past couple of days. Tasting, sucking, nibbling, tugging at her hard nipples, squeezing the supple and generous flesh. "You have the most wonderful tits. This is Ok, right? Let me know if I'm too rough," I told her softly, before sucking her nipple deep into my mouth, biting down carefully on her breast, hearing the sweet sound of her first moan. I flicked my tongue across the pink peak, before taking it between my teeth and pulling, stretching her tit out. Her torso twisted, offering her tit to me. When I felt the tension was too much, I closed my lips and sucked hard on her nipple, until it popped free. I gave its twin similar treatment, playing until the need to continue urged me downward. 

 The voyage was a slow one, exploring the flatland of her waist from side to side, from tits to tan-line, teasing her cute innie, nibbling her soft flesh. I pushed the sleeping bag down, exposing her body under the dim outside light of the fire reflected off our tent. My eyes had grown accustomed to the dark, and I could barely make out shadows of my playmates. Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 04 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© I was at her hips, licking her hip bones, tugging on her fine pubes with my lips. 

 "You don't mind the hair?" she asked nervously. 

 What a stupid question. "It's beautiful. Perfect. Like all of you. So fine and soft, all natural like everything about you. Never shave it off. It would be a crime." I ran my fingers through it playfully, tugging lightly. 

 "I thought guys liked it shaved," she said. 

 "I don't know about anyone else, but I swear as God is my witness, I couldn't imagine anything more perfect than your pretty little playground here. You keep it trimmed so cutely, a little arrow, pointing the way to heaven." 

 I heard her giggle, and felt her running her fingers through my hair. "I really like that. The way you're touching me and playing with me. It's so sexy." 

 I was rubbing my face against the soft down, my tongue brushing her skin, my hands moving lower, at the joint of her leg, my thumbs stroking the soft flesh where her legs met her body. 

 With her puffy tight pussy in front of me, I took the playing more seriously, exploring her, playing with the narrow folds of flesh, pinching gently, pulling, parting her lips. She started squirming, her hips rolling. I licked the inside of her thighs, the outside of her swollen lips. I teased the inner folds open, sucking each one gently, hearing more delightful moans. 

 Moving my mouth over the top of her pussy, I sucked in all the flesh surrounding her clit, rubbing my tongue against the folds, pushing around the elusive bump within. "God, Alex, that's good," she moaned, her hand back in my hair. An excellent barometer. 

 I eased a finger inside of her, pressing against the outer walls, pushing downward, feeling the give of her flesh. I continued the sucking, while a second finger joined the first, easing her open, preparing her. 

 I looked up toward Lisa, and saw that Teri had followed me down, her face only a couple of inches from mine, straining in the near total dark to see what I was doing. 

 Lisa's hips were driving against my mouth, her breath coming faster, her hands pressing my head down. "Close," she whispered, "I'm so close." 

 I gave my tongue a little more freedom, piercing the folds, working its way down to tease her sensitive clit while I kept my mouth over her. My fingers were teasing the upper inside of her pussy, rubbing across the rough texture just a couple of inches inside, urging her onward. 

 The orgasm burst upon her suddenly, her legs clenching tightly around my head, her fingers pulling at my hair. "Fuuuuuuuck," she groaned, lifting her hips several inches from the ground, her entire body taut as one of the ropes tying down our tarps. 

 Her body slowly released its tension, settling back down, her legs opening invitingly, her hands brushing my hair back. "Sorry, I'm sorry," she whispered. "I didn't hurt you, did I?" 

 I gave her a long slow lick the entire length of her pussy. "No. It was nice." 

 "Nice?" she asked. "I almost tore your hair out and snapped your neck." 

 I climbed up her body, wiping my face dry with a hand, before kissing her. "Nice. I made you feel like that. That reaction. I loved it." 

 I kissed her again more thoroughly. "Are you ready for me now?" 

 She nodded, "Please. I need to feel you inside me." 

 I opened her legs, taking my cock in hand, and rubbing it up and down her opening, spreading the lips, pushing in just a bit. "I'm going to start now," I told her, pushing the head in far enough to lodge it in her opening. "You're tight. Really tight," I told her. 

 "Too tight?" she asked, teasingly. 

 "I hope not." I leaned over and kissed her again. "If I forget later, I want to thank you for this. For choosing me." 

 She hugged me, "God, how I wish you had been my first," she said. 

 "I am. This may hurt a little, but I'm going to take your cherry now. I can't get in any further until I do. Alright?" 

 She looked up at me, her gorgeous blue eyes only glistening shadows in the dark. "I'm ready." 

 I bent over her, my hands holding her shoulders. I thrust hard, driving into her to the very root. 

 She gasped, thrusting back against me, her back arching, her fingers digging into me, "Oh God!" 

 I held still, while she ground against my cock, "I know it hurts a little. Let me know when it's Ok to move again." 

 She moaned, "I felt it, Alex. I really felt you take my cherry," she said. 

 "I know, it was wonderful," I told her, leaning over her and kissing her softly, my cock buried inside of her. 

 "No, I'm serious. I could swear it was the real thing. That was fucking intense," she said, clutching me to her. "Fuck me now, slow and easy, while I get used to it." 

 I eased my cock out of her slowly, and took my time with her, screwing her so slowly, long full strokes. I started moving my hips more sideways, stirring her up. 

 "Oh shit! Do that some more," she said. 

 I fucked her for a long time, like that, on her back, playing inside of her. Fast and slow, short strokes, and long ones. All the different angles I could find, moving her legs around, using her wonderfully. 

 Teri spent much of the time behind me, up on her knees, holding me, touching me, kissing my shoulders and neck, and watching my cock pierce Lisa endlessly. "How long does this go on?" she asked quietly. 

 "Until one of us can't take it any longer. I'm thinking hours." 

 "You're going to last hours?" Teri asked. 

 "No. I'm going to last a good long while, over and over again." 

 "When are you going to go crazy on her?" 

 "I'm not. This is our first time. She may not even come. This is all about learning each other, and getting that sweet virgin pussy of hers used to having my fat cock inside of it." 

 Lisa was beautiful, laying there for me, eyes closed, letting me have her. I felt her start up the peak toward orgasm a few times, before falling short and moaning sweetly when I'd change things up. 

 "Let her come, Alex," Teri said. "I want to see it. A virgin's first orgasm on a cock." 

 It was worth a try. I leaned over Lisa. "I want you to come for me. What do you need?" 

 "Long firm strokes, Alex. All the way to the bottom," she said softly. 

 I kissed her, and did as she asked. Long, firm and fast, all the way. 

 "A little slower, and grind at the bottom," she gasped. 

 I slowed down, fucking her hard, grinding my hips against her with every stroke. I'd found her weakness, and watched her scale the peaks again, the sexiest sounds escaping her lips. 

 I could feel her legs trembling, and I pressed them backward, my hands gripping the back of her thighs tightly. I tried to maintain that same pace, not wanting to change anything, when it seemed to be working for her so well. 

 She started whimpering, squeezing her own tits, tugging on her nipples. "Harder," she begged. 

 I didn't speed up much, but each thrust was powerful, shaking her body. I found a motion that rubbed my pubic bone against her clit, sliding against it, at the end of each stroke. Her moans and whimpers became a gasp, and then quiet. I kept pounding her, and she finally went off, huge. She screamed out, and I hurried to cover her mouth with my hand, while I kept fucking her, milking the orgasm out of her. She screamed into my hand again, successfully muffled, squirming underneath me. 

 I eased up on her, fucking her slowly, while she recovered. She lay quietly, legs splayed open, unmoving, while I still played inside of her. She giggled abruptly. "Now THAT's how you fuck a virgin. Damn, Teri, I'm so jealous." 

 "Jealous of me?" Teri laughed. 

 "Hell yeah! That's what it going to be like for you, only better," Lisa said stretching sexily. "I got 5 seconds and an apology." 

 Teri gave me a hug. "Is that what our first time's going to be like, Alex?" 

 I stopped my motion and pulled her in for a kiss. "Yeah, except I won't stop you from screaming." 

 I pulled out of Lisa, and turned her over, lifting her hips up nice and high. "I've been dying to do this," I told her. 

 "Don't let me stop you," Lisa answered with a chuckle. 

 The last one had been for her, this one was all for me. I slid back into her and grabbed her hips, hammering her hard from behind. When I got a little tired, I made her fuck me, holding still while she did the work, backing up against me. I played with her firm round ass cheeks, squeezing and fondling them when I was screwing her easily, before grabbing her hips again and fucking her as hard as I could. 

 "Fuck," she gasped, "I'm going to come for you." 

 I looked at Teri, slowing the pace, "Don't let her scream." 

 Teri scrambled up the sleeping bag, holding Lisa's head in her lap. I hammered her again, as hard and fast as I could, for as long as I could last. I felt her tensing up, her teasing whimpers accelerating. It felt incredible, fucking her like I was, as hard as I could, claiming her completely, stretching her, molding her tight little pussy into my shape. I couldn't see what Teri was doing, but I knew Lisa was on the edge. And she was taking me there with her. "I'm coming, baby," I groaned, my hips going into overdrive, until I slammed deep into her, erupting powerfully inside. 

 Lisa was trembling, but quiet. "She's coming, Alex," Teri said softly. 

 I pushed the last of my cum into her, with short firm strokes, bottoming out with each. She whimpered sweetly, while I finished with a few last easy strokes, enjoying her while any remnant of my hardness lasted. 

 Teri moaned, "Lisa!" She gasped a few seconds later. "Oh God, Lisa!" 

 I eased in and out, until I wasn't hard enough to continue, sliding out of her. She stayed on her knees. I moved forward, and saw she had her head between Teri's legs. 

 I sidled up to Teri, holding her. "I guess she's as wild as her sister," I said softly, stroking Lisa's hair. 

 "Jesus, Alex," Teri whispered. "She's so good at it." 

 I played with Teri's breasts, kissing her shoulder. "I'll have to ask her for lessons." 

 Lisa rolled off, gasping for air. "Damn!" she murmured. "I need a break." 

 I laughed, straightening out the sleeping bags so we could lay in them together, a hottie on each side of me. 

 I pulled Lisa to my side, hugging her to me. "You're just full of surprises this weekend." 

 She cuddled in tight, "Is that Ok?" she asked sleepily. 

 "It's wonderful. Are we official now?" I asked, kissing her forehead. 

 "I hope so. Any more official I wouldn't be able to walk," she whispered. 

 I caressed her amazing body, still finding it hard to believe she was mine. Teri was squirming against my other side, looking for attention. 

 I turned to her, and found her lips, kissing her gently. She sighed, relaxing against me. "I could kick myself for losing you," she said softly. 

 I chuckled, which had Lisa tunneling under my arm. "You can't lose me, ever." 

 "You know what I mean. All these years when I didn't know, and now, because I was afraid." 

 I pressed my lips to her ear. "Girlfriends come and go. You are for keeps." 

 She kissed me again, a little more possessively. "Would you be my first if I asked?" 

 "Absolutely. I might have to invite the sisters along for the show, but there's no way I'd miss that." 

 "I'm having second thoughts. That sex thing looks kind of fun." 

 I gave her ass a squeeze, while she giggled. "It does!" she whispered. 

 "Let's see how you feel by the light of day." 

 She kissed my chin, "How do I feel now?" 

 "Like a dream come true. Honestly, you guys are killing me. The only thing I have left to fantasize about is going all the way with you. All my other fantasies have come true." 

 "Like?" she crawled more on top of me, her leg between mine, her arms around my neck. 

 "Anything with you. Seeing you naked, feeling your mouth on me, even just kissing you, are all things I've dreamed about for years." 

 "Not disappointed?" she asked tentatively. 

 "Not in the least." 

 "Not even the boobage? I'm the only B cup around." 

 "I love your cute tits, Teri." 

 "What other fantasies? And not about me." 

 "Shannon, of course. I've been dreaming about her for over a year. Unbelievable." 

 She chuckled, kissing me softly. "Good word for it. What else?" 

 "Lisa. I use to fantasize about her a lot last year." 

 "Not Julie?" 

 "No, she was under the radar until the last couple of months. And somehow I believed I could get her if I wanted her." 

 "Uh, yeah. Not like she didn't make it pretty damn clear." 

 "What was your favorite?" I asked. 

 She kissed me. "Easy. When you pulled out of Heather and came in my mouth. The first time I put my mouth on any guy's thing, and I got a mouthful. Between her juices on you, and the way you shot in my mouth, I shocked myself that I was doing it. Then swallowing your cum and sucking you back hard. God, I felt so naughty. Nasty. A dirty little girl, for you." She was rubbing her leg against my cock, and kissing my neck. "How about you?" 

 "The whole sleeping bag scene last night, especially the moment you climbed on me naked. My heart almost stopped. All up until the moment you were poised to take me, only a few seconds from making the ultimate fantasy come true, and that damn Shannon with the flashlight." 

 She giggled. "Kind of how I felt when the sisters showed up at your tent. Otherwise, I knew that Heather and I were going to give you everything." 

 I held her quietly, caressing her. "John, huh?" 

 She sighed. "Yeah. I'm interested. Lost two in one night. You and him. To the top of your list, no less." 

 "Patience, my naughty little BJ queen. I have a feeling Dominique and he may not last." 

 "Really? Why?" 

 "She knows he likes you better. She was jealous, when you were on his lap kissing. She told me to either take her, or take you back to my tent. Doesn't sound like she's too serious, if taking her was one of the options." 

 "And you chose me. Any regrets?" 

 I spanked her bottom. "None." 

 She lay on me kissing my shoulders and neck. "Sleep, naughty girl." 

 "Can I suck you again?" she said softly. 

 "I'm done. Really. Wiped." 

 "I don't care. Can I?" 

 "Go ahead if you want. Like I would ever say no to that?" 

 She climbed into the sleeping bag and took me in her mouth. It was wonderful and relaxing to feel her warm mouth on me. She was getting better, and she got me semi-hard. Pretty big and thick, but not quite fully up. She was content to suck and play with me for a long time, long enough for me to go to sleep with my 7th grade fantasy girl's mouth full of my cock. 

 * * * 

 I woke with the dawn, and a bad case of morning wood, in a tent full of naked women. I had to pee badly. I managed to free myself from the tangle of arms in the sleeping bag, and headed for the tent entrance, slipping out quietly. It took me a minute or so to soften enough to take a leak. The rain had stopped, and I looked around at the shelter, where everything was dead. 

 I would get the fire going in a minute. 

 I climbed back in the tent, stroking myself to hardness. I wanted to wake up Shannon right. She was only half covered by the sleeping bag, and she looked incredibly sexy. I moved the covers off of her, and opened her legs. God, I couldn't believe I was going to fuck her again, even if only for a little fun. 

 I rubbed myself across her opening, firming up instantly, and slid my cock into her. It took a little effort, and I leaned over her, kissing her lips. She slowly woke, opening her mouth to me. I kissed her deeply, my tongue exploring her mouth, while my cock eased its way into her. 

 She sighed, stretching and smiling. "Morning handsome," she said softly. 

 She cracked one eye, tilting her head. "What time is it?" 

 "Sun's coming up. I'm going to tend the fire in a minute and get the coffee going. But I couldn't resist having you again." 

 She smiled. "I'm glad. I've never been woken up better." 

 I fucked her easily, enjoying the ride, wanting nothing more than that feeling of being inside her. 

 "Did we really do it with everyone watching?" she whispered. 

 "Uh, huh." 

 "And again, with all those girls teasing me?" 

 "Yep. They love you, you know. You're everyone's favorite, not just mine." 

 She sighed. "God, I can't believe I let this happen. If word gets out..." 

 "Not a word to anyone. Ever. I promise. It stays in this tent. And in a couple of minutes, you're going to get dressed, and help me with the fire and coffee." 

 "Just a few more minutes?" she said sleepily. 

 I kissed her lips softly. "Sure. I'm going to say good morning to Julie for a bit. She fell asleep shortly after you." 

 "Mmm. Ok. You know how to wake me when it's time." 

 I pulled out of her, covered her up, and moved over a little, uncovering Julie. She was dead to the world, and I was fucking her for a couple of minutes before I got any response at all. 

 She was sighing in her sleep, while I long-stroked her. Her eyes popped open, and she looked startled. 

 "Shh, it's me, baby." I told her, stroking her hair, and pressing my lips softly to hers. 

 She sighed deeply, relaxing, "What a dream!" she whispered. "I dreamed you were teaching me how to fly, and to do it, I had to have you in me. When I woke, I thought we were really flying." 

 "Sorry, no flying." 

 She purred, wriggling against me. "This is so much better." 

 "I'm going to go get the fires burning, and start the coffee. But I wanted to tell you how wonderful being with you was. And say good morning to my new girlfriend." 

 She sighed, while I fucked her gently. "It was wonderful, wasn't it?" 

 "Perfect." 

 "You going to wake up sissy like this?" 

 "I thought I'd let her sleep," I whispered. "We were up pretty late." 

 "No. She'd love this. I promise. A little wakeup surprise on our first full day together." 

 This was getting a little crazy. "Ok, I hate to stop though," I said. 

 She giggled. "Don't worry. You're going to get as much of this as you can stand." 

 I kissed her softly, pulling out and covering her up. "You can sleep for another hour or so." 

 "Mmmhmm," she murmured. 

 I crawled into the sleeping bag, and rolled Lisa gently onto her back. I moved on top of her, and she reached for me, opening her legs, her eyes still close. I guided my cock into her, her sister's juices still wet on my cock. I pushed into her firmly, all the way inside within a couple of strokes, her arms holding me. 

 "Never wake me," she murmured. 

 It was slow and gentle, like the previous two, and she laid there quietly, not moving other than to sigh or moan quietly. I kissed her face, neck and shoulders, while I enjoyed her. When I kissed her, she opened her mouth slightly, letting me do whatever I wanted, her tongue barely moving in response. 

 I was getting excited, and slowed to almost a stop. "Go back to sleep. It was just a dream," I whispered in her ear. 

 She smiled and murmured, "Thank you." 

 I had a brief urge to wake Teri the same way, but I managed to suppress it, going back to Shannon. She accepted me easily, and I fucked her a little harder, my excitement level almost out the roof. Doing the three of them like that was beyond incredible. 

 "God, I need to come for you," I whispered. 

 "Good," she whispered. 

 I hunched over her and gave her a minute or so of fast thrusting, until I had reached my limit. I put my lips against hers, and came strongly, pumping her full. She kissed me back, holding me. I pulled out of her, and she sighed sweetly. "Damn, Alex. Best alarm clock ever," she whispered. 

 I climbed up and held my cock in front of her mouth. She looked up at me, her eyebrows cocked. "Really?" 

 "Please," I begged. 

 She sat up a little, bent over and took me in her mouth. She sucked me clean, and kept at it for a while, until I started to firm up, stopping before I could get fully hard. 

 "You are so spoiled," she whispered, teasingly. 

 "I know." 

 "Help me find my clothes," she said. 

 We sorted through the clothing scattered around the tent, and found hers and mine. We got dressed, bumping into each other at the front of the tent. I reached out for a couple of nice gropes, which she would tolerate for a bit, before pushing me away. "Later. At home." Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** The Last Boy Scout Ch. 04 ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© I pulled her close for a hug and a kiss. "Is there going to be a later, for us?" I asked nervously. 

 "I hope so," she said. 

 With shirt and shorts on, I climbed out of the tent into a new day. 

 * * * 

 I did my job, getting the fires going, putting on some boiling water, and starting the coffee. I thought I'd be exhausted, but I was exhilarated. 

 Shannon joined me shortly after I got going, and parked her sexy little butt in front of the fire, sipping her coffee and watching we work. 

 I walked around sleeping bodies, seeing them slowly come to life, while I started putting some things away, folding up the tarps that were on top of the logs, breaking down the two shelters that nobody was under. A few people were moving around, and Julie came over and gave me a hug and a kiss. 

 "Cocoa's with Miss Shannon," I told her. 

 She grinned sleepily, filling her mug and sitting next to Shannon, leaning against her. Shannon put her arm around her. It was so cute, I wanted to drag them back to my tent. 

 The sun was out, the sky was blue, and the day was quickly heating up. The breakfast crowd started in preparing all the food that was left. We were going to be picked up at 11:00, so we didn't have too much time to waste. I started breaking down the girl's tents, watching couples emerge from their tents, hand in hand, heading for the coffee, the food, or down toward the water. 

 I saw John emerge with Dominique, both of them looking quite content. Dominique gave me a wave and a smile, as she headed upstream, and John headed down. Max emerged, leaning in and giving Wendy a kiss at the entrance of their tent. He grinned hugely headed my way. 

 "Success?" I asked. 

 "Third base, and then some," he said. "Give me some direction. I'm your slave for life." 

 I laughed, and accepted his help folding up the Samuelson girls' tent. Heather walked over as we worked on the tent she was supposed to have shared with Erin. She gave me a hug. "Morning, Alex." 

 I leaned over and gave her a small kiss. "Sleep well?" 

 "Better than I would have in that tent of yours, unfortunately." 

 I chuckled. "I'll see if I can't make it up to you." 

 "You do that. Making me sleep all alone," she pouted. 

 She helped Max and I fold up the tent, stacking their gear next to it. I looked over and all my girls were sitting by the fire, chatting, content to let me slave away. 

 The morning flew by, eating breakfast flanked by the sisters, tearing down the shelters, my tent, cleaning up the campsite. It was fun to see that six of the eight guys had managed to get paired up. Ellen was all googly eyed for one of the underclassmen, which suited me just fine, getting her away from Dr. Reed. 

 No surprise that me and my new girlfriends got quite a bit of attention, especially with Teri constantly with us. I was feeling pretty damn good about myself, free with the hugs and kisses, until Shannon put the kibosh on that. 

 "Enough, Alex. We can let a little PDA slide, but you're getting a little ridiculous. Set an example." 

 I grinned. "I am Miss Shannon." 

 She rolled her eyes at me. "A GOOD example for once, Mr. Hamilton." Any sternness in her tone was ameliorated by the little wink she gave me. 

 At 10:30, the site was cleared and the gear stacked out on the road. I had help this time, three willing girlfriends, if I got to count Teri, as well as Max and even Wendy. It only took 1 trip for all of us to lug my gear out. 

 We made one last pass of the campsite, and waited for the bus. I pulled Julie to one side, and leaned against the same railing where we'd confirmed she was my girl the day before. 

 "Less than 24 hours ago, right here," I teased. 

 "Want me to do it again?" she asked, grinning. 

 "I do, but I think that would be a little over the top, don't you?" 

 Lisa ambled over. "Let me guess. BJ home-base?" she asked. 

 Julie nodded. "Pretty cool, huh?" 

 The bus showed up a few minutes later, and my girls ran for the doors. "We'll let you do the heavy lifting," Lisa said. 

 I did. It seemed like John, Max and I did 90% of the work, but that's probably just me. Shannon and Dr. Reed were back in teacher mode, giving directions, and chasing people down. 

 I got on the bus, sad to leave. One unexpected storm had changed my life forever, I knew that, and wondered how things would be. The girls waved to me from the back of the bus, and I saw they had commandeered the entire last bench. It was going to be a cozy fit, with me and my pretty blonde girlfriends on one side, and John on the other, flanked by Dominique by the window and Teri on his other side next to Lisa. 

 Max and Wendy were in front of us, and Heather was seated next to Miss Shannon on the other side. Dr. Reed was in the first row, responsible for chaperoning the front, while Miss Shannon had back of the bus responsibilities. 

 She turned around and faced us. "Don't get too carried away back there, you hear me, Mister Hamilton?" 

 Lisa leaned forward and whispered in her ear. Shannon blushed almost as red as her hair, and turned around. 

 I pulled her close, "What did you say to her," I asked softly. 

 "I told her we're going to blow you all the way home. She can have a turn if she wants," she whispered to me. 

 Julie already was working on opening my pants, not content to just open the top, but pulling them down to my ankles. The bus wasn't moving for more than a few seconds before she had her face in my lap. 

 It looked like it was going to be a hell of a year.

 I hope you enjoyed The Last Boy Scout. I have a few more of Alex's adventures plotted out, but nothing as extensive as this little tale. His early relationships with Miss Shannon, and with John. I like the characters and may add to the series, once I finish a few more works that I have committed to. Thanks for all the support, votes, and comments. They are always appreciated. Report_Story
