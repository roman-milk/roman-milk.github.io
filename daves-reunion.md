 ****** Dave's Reunion ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I was sitting in Bennigan's with my wife and my best friend Ben. Ben and I had been friends forever it seemed, at least from the sixth grade on. After we finished eating we sat there making small talk and Ben asked me if I was going to our classes twentieth reunion and I told him that I wasn't. 

 "Hey bud, you really need to go, the things are a blast." 

 "Why would I want to go and see those assholes? Most of them made my life miserable when I went to school with them." 

 "That's the beauty of it bud, you get to go back and see what they turned into. You didn't go back to the tenth so you missed out on some pretty good laughs. Remember Beverly Abeg? Miss Super Hot Cheerleader who thought that her shit didn't stink? She waddled into the reunion bud, actually waddled. She was two- fifty if she was an ounce. It did my heart good to see her like that. She turned me down for a date half a dozen times when we were in school. It tickled me to death to be there with Marcia (his very foxy wife) on my arm. Billy Holbrook, star quarterback and Mr. Big Shot On Campus is bald and has a beer belly that you wouldn't believe. You have to go bud. You owe it to yourself to see what a bunch of losers that the people who put you down really are." 

 "I don't think so Ben. I've put all that behind me and I think I prefer it that way." 

 "Oh come on bud, forget about those assholes. You need to go back and rub their noses in it. You are successful, you have a gorgeous wife and you keep yourself in great shape. You ain't Mr. Four Eyed Nerd anymore. Go back bud, go back, flaunt it and rub it in." 

 "It's not my style Ben." 

 "Okay, then do it for me." 

 "What?" 

 "When I went back for the tenth people asked about you and I told them how great you were doing. I'm sure that none of them believed me so go show them that I'm not a liar." 

 Then my wife Julie chimed in, "You should go Dave. It would give you closure on some of the things that you have carried around in your head for so long." 

 +++++ 

 I didn't really want to do it, but between Ben and Julie they finally wore me down and got me to agree to go. The three of us made plans to make the two hundred-mile drive and then at the last minute Ben's company sent him out of town on business. As Julie and I drove I thought back to my high school years and remembered how much I had hated them. I was the classic example of the kid that everybody liked to pick on. Glasses, a little pudgy, not interested in sports, grade A student, in short, I was what everybody called a nerd. I was the butt of practical jokes and girls laughed at me when I asked them for dates. The only friends I had were my fellow nerds and of course Ben. In general, the whole period from sixth to twelfth grade sucked. 

 Things changed for me in college. There was a more divergent student body and most of the kids there were there to learn so I wasn't the odd man out. Contact lens came along and that put an end to the Coke bottle glasses I had been wearing. I got a girlfriend who ran track and she made me run with her almost every day and that put an end the pudginess. Stella and I ended up splitting, but I never stopped running and it has kept me in pretty decent shape. I was definitely not the Dave Wilson who had graduated from that school twenty years ago. 

 It was a good thing that we were all wearing name tags because I did not recognize a soul. I began to understand what Ben had been trying to tell me in Bennigan's. Almost all the girls that I had been enraptured by in high school were matronly looking, overweight, wearing too much makeup and I couldn't believe all the dyed hair I saw. I smiled to myself when I thought about how I had lusted after them and had wished that I could make them mine. Now I thanked God that none of them had taken me up on my advances. The guys, with several exceptions, were all about the same. Almost every one of the jocks had let themselves go and they looked like a bunch of fat used car salesmen. 

 I was surprised to find that the ones who had come through the years in decent shape were my fellow nerds. We all ended up at the same table and began to compare careers, goals and the rest. The nerds had gone to college, applied themselves and had become successful and like most successful people they found that it was to their benefit to have a good appearance and that meant staying fit. I looked at the only friends that I'd had in that miserable school and to a man they all looked better than the guys who had been the jocks and the most popular guys in school - and we all knew it. We sat there and looked at all the ones that had looked down on us and made life hell for us and then we had a good laugh at how things had turned out. 

 I had been so wrapped up in talking to my old friends that I had not paid too much attention to Julie. She had been asked to dance by a couple of guys and I had lost track of her. I looked around and didn't see her and I figured that she must have gone to the ladies room. I went back to talking, but a half-hour later I looked around again and still didn't see her. I excused myself from the group and went looking for her. I asked people if they had seen her and no one had. It might have been my imagination, but I thought I saw smirks on several faces as I went around looking for Julie. Finally one girl told me that she thought she had seen Julie leave with Billy Mack and Bobby Joe Martin. I asked the girl if she had any idea where they might have gone and the girl's face flushed, she looked away from me and said she had to be going. I didn't think she knew what she was talking about anyway. Why would Julie have left with two black guys? 

 I was walking back to the table I'd been sitting at and as I passed by another table I heard a snatch of conversation, "...Bobby Joe got a party going up in room 623 and he...." I tried to remember if there was more than one Bobby Joe in our class and while I wasn't positive, I was pretty sure that there was only one. Did Julie leave to go to a party without telling me, or was I so wrapped up in talking to my friends that I didn't hear her. I didn't think she would go without telling me. Maybe she just got bored and went up to our room. When I got back to the table I said goodbye, promised to keep in touch and headed up to our room. 

 +++++ 

 Julie wasn't there. I picked up the phone and asked the desk to connect to Bobby Joe Martin's room. When the phone was answered I could hear a lot of noise in the background and I asked for Bobby Joe, "This is he." 

 "This is Dave Wilson Booby Joe and I'm looking for my wife. Someone said that they thought that she might have gone up to a party in your room." 

 "Yeah Dave, she's here. Room 623, come on up" and he hung up. 

 I wasn't all that sure that I wanted to party with Bobby Joe and Billy. While they had never been among my tormenters in high school, they hadn't been all that friendly either. The black students had hung together and very few of them had made any effort to get to know the white students. To be fair about it though the white students hadn't made any effort to get to know the blacks either. No matter, Julie was at the party so I had to go there. 

 I knocked on the door to 623 and the door was opened by a black guy whose nametag said "Jeff Lewis." I vaguely remembered him, but I don't believe we had ever spoken before. "Dave, you lucky motherfucker, come on in." 

 I walked in the door and the first thing I saw was Julie. She was on the bed naked and on her knees with her head buried in a pillow and with Billy buried in her pussy. 

 "What the fuck?" I yelled and started toward the bed to shove Billy off of her. Hands grabbed me and forcefully shoved me down in a chair and held me there. 

 "Sorry man, I had hoped that you would be cool with this" Bobby Joe said. For the first time I noticed that there were eight black men in the room besides Billy. I struggled to get up and Jeff grabbed Julie's bra up off the floor and used it to tie my hands behind my back and the he tore up a pillowcase and used it to tie me to the chair. 

 "Sorry about this Dave," Jeff said, "But we don't want you getting hurt and that's just what would happen if you tried to interfere." 

 "Sorry about this Dave" Bobby Joe said, "Me and Billy thought we could rip off a quick piece and get her back to the reunion before you missed her, but some of these guys found out we had her here and they wanted a taste of her too and things kind of got out of hand." 

 On the bed Billy was hissing, "Here it comes baby, here it comes" and then he stopped plunging into Julie and just held himself still while he drained. When he got off the bed I could see that he had been in Julie's ass and not her pussy. As soon as he was out of the way another guy got on the bed and plowed into my wife. She moaned and I saw her push her ass back at the invading black cock. The man started fucking her and she began moaning into the pillow again. Billy came over and stood by me, "She loves it man. You are one lucky motherfucker to have her full time. She is one hot piece of ass and it was well worth the wait." 

 "What wait. What are you talking about?" 

 "I've been waiting ten years for this and for the entire ten years I've been praying that you would come back for this reunion and bring this slut with you." 

 "What the hell are you talking about?" 

 "When Ben came back for the tenth reunion we got to drinking and talking about pussy. He told Bobby Joe and me that your old lady was the finest piece of pussy he'd ever had. The way he described her and what she did to him made me and Bobby Joe want to meet her." 

 "He told you that? Ben told you that he was fucking my wife?" 

 "Said he was doing her before you got married and just never got around to stopping. That's how we got her up here man. Told her if she didn't take care of us me and Bobby Joe would make sure that you found out about her and Ben." 

 "So why are you shooting him through the grease now?" 

 "We're caught man. If we had got her back downstairs you would have never known, but we didn't. When this is over and you talk to her she would have to tell you because she can't holler rape, not without us blowing the whistle on her and Ben." 

 On the bed the man fucking Julie had finished and Jeff and another guy rolled Julie over onto her back. Jeff moved between her legs and they came up and locked around him as he speared into her. I saw her white hand reach over, grasp the other man's black cock and pull it to her mouth. I don't think that she was yet aware that I was even in the room. 

 I sat tied to the chair and watched as three more blacks fucked Julie and it wasn't until two of them wanted her ass and pussy at the same time that Julie knew I was in the room. Two of them had just finished, one cumming in her mouth and one unloading in her cunt, and the next two pulled her up so they could sit her on one while the other took her ass from behind. As soon as she was pulled up into a sitting position she saw me and her face drained of color. Then the two men pushed her into the position that they wanted her, which had her facing away from me, and then they started fucking her. For the first time since I'd come in the room Julie didn't have her face in a pillow or a cock in her mouth and I got to hear more than just moans. 

 "Oh God, oh Jesus, oh yes, like that, just like that, fuck me, fuck me hard." 

 Even as they plowed her holes and she asked them to fuck her harder she kept trying to look back over her shoulder at me, but the guy on the bottom kept pulling her face down to his so he could tongue fuck her mouth. Even with her mouth on his I could still hear her mewls of pleasure as both cocks continued to batter at her ass and cunt. 

 The guy in Julie's ass finished first and as he got off the bed Julie pulled her head up and looked back at me. She started to say something but just then Bobby Joe shoved his cock in her ass and I saw her face contort as she screamed out, "Oh yes, oh dear God yes!" 

 I looked up at Jeff, "You can cut me loose now. I've seen all I care to see and I want to leave." 

 When I was untied I got up and headed for the door and Jeff said, "We'll take good care of her and see that she gets back to your room safe. 

 "Keep her for all I care. I've got no use for a whore." 

 I went back to my room and packed all of my stuff and then I packed all of Julie's. I carried Julie's bags up to room 623 and when Billy answered the door I handed him the bags and then I headed down to the front desk to check out and get started on the long ride home. 

 +++++ 

 When I got home there were seven messages on the answering machine, all of them from Julie, and I deleted them without listening to them. My mood pretty much sucked so I called in sick to work on Monday. Julie called six times and I either let the machine take the call or I took the call myself and then hung up when I heard her voice. So I happened to be at home at two in the afternoon when Ben called. The surprise at getting me at home that early in the day was evident in his voice, "Oh Dave, how you doing bud?" 

 "Julie's not here Ben." 

 "Julie? Why would I be calling Julie?" 

 "You tell me Ben. Why would you be calling here this time of day for me? I'm supposed to be at work, remember?" 

 There was silence on the other end of the line. "You might be able to reach her at the Hyatt, you know, the hotel where the reunion was held. Try Bobby Joe's room. It's room 623. If she's still there though she may just be too busy to take your call. Last time I saw her she had a black cock pushing into her from either end. It seems that Billy Mack and Bobby Joe Martin got so fired up by what you told them at the tenth reunion - you know, about how good a fuck my wife was - that they just had to try her themselves. Oh and by the way Ben, I don't think it would be a good idea for you to ever let me see you again." 

 For the next three days the phone calls from Julie kept coming in and I either deleted them from the answering machine or hung up on her. On the fourth day I received a registered letter at my office and I opened it up to find that it was from Julie. At first I was just going to throw it away, but then I got curious. No salutation, just "I hoped that we could talk before I came home, but it is obvious that you are never going to take my calls which is too bad because we have a lot that we need to talk about. Regardless of what you think of me know this - you are and always have been the love of my life and I do not want and never have wanted to spend my life with anyone but you. I'm renting a car and I will be home when you get home from work and I will not leave the house until we talk." 

 +++++ 

 When I pulled into the drive at six that evening there were two cars there. One with a rental agency sticker in the window and Ben's car. I found them both sitting on the couch waiting for me when I walked in. Ben stood up and held up his hands, "Just listen to me first Dave and then you can go ahead and whip my ass if you want - I won't even try to defend myself - but hear me out first." 

 I just stood there and looked at him as he went on, "I have never had sex with Julie. Not that I haven't wanted to, but she has always been yours and I have never tried. I am guilty of being human though and I did say a lot to Billy and Bobby Joe that I shouldn't have. We were drinking and talking about the girls we used to chase in school and who scored on whom. Then we got to talking about women that we would like to have sex with and to make myself look like a stud to them I lied about Julie and me. That was ten years ago Dave, I never thought that they would remember any of that stuff. It was all just bullshit Dave. I picked Julie to brag about because she was the one woman that I most wanted. I never would have ever done anything to deliberately hurt Julie, you know I wouldn't." 

 When he finished talking he stood there and waited for me to say something. I just stared at him for several seconds and then I told him to leave, "Just get out of here Ben. Just go." 

 "I'm sorry Dave, honest to God I'm sorry" and he left. 

 I went over and sat down in the chair across from the couch and looked at Julie. There was maybe a minute of silence and then Julie said, "I'm sorry Dave, but it wasn't my fault." 

 "How could it not be your fault Julie. You went up to the room with them. What did you think that two black men were going to do with you, play cards?" 

 "I shouldn't have gone up to the room with them and I know that now. I had a few too many and I wasn't thinking clearly at the time. Billy and Bobby Joe told me what Ben told them and I told them that they were wrong, that it was all bullshit. They said they had proof that he hadn't lied and they told me that they would show it to me. I told them they couldn't have proof because it wasn't true and then Billy said, "Okay, come on up and we'll show you. I stupidly went up with them and then once in the room it was just a case of "Let's rape the white bitch." 

 "Julie, I was there. They tied me to a fucking chair and I had to sit there and watch while nine guys fucked you in every hole you had. If it was rape you damn sure weren't fighting it. I heard you begging them to fuck you. I heard you scream out, "Oh yes, just like that, fuck me, fuck me hard." That sure doesn't sound like rape to me." 

 "How long have we been married Dave, fifteen years? In fifteen years you haven't noticed how responsive I am when we have sex? How many times have you wanted sex and I said no that I didn't feel like it and you went ahead and took me anyway? Did you ever notice that those times I tried to lay there and not give you the satisfaction of responding? Was I ever successful? No I wasn't. Once you got started my body responded and you had me screaming in two minutes. Why would you expect it to be any different just because men that I weren't married to started shoving cocks in me? I fought them Dave. I struggled, I called them every filthy name I could think of and they just laughed and kept on fucking me. I thought I did pretty good considering. I managed to lay there stiff as a board the first time that Billy fucked me and for the first two times that Bobby Joe had me, but by Billy's second time my body had taken over and then it was non-stop until nine o'clock the next morning." 

 She looked at me like she was expecting me to say something, but I just sat there and looked at her. 

 "You were there Dave. Did you see a break in the action where my body could come down from it's sexual high? And if it had do you think that it would have made any difference? I couldn't fight off Billy and Bobby Joe so how the hell could I have fought off nine of them? Even if they had stopped to let me rest for an hour or two they still would have had me going again by the time the third or fourth guy fucked me. I didn't do it on purpose Dave. It wasn't my fault. I know I contributed by being stupid enough to go up to the room with them, but I only did that so I could shoot down their so-called proof. When it was over I couldn't even call the cops and holler rape because they videotaped me begging for more cock. So there it is Dave. I might have been turned into a nigger-loving whore for one night, but it was only because my body did what comes natural to it. I'm sorry that I can't go back and undo it, that I can't go back and do things differently. I love you Dave and I always have. I'm hoping and praying that you love me as much or at least enough to help us get past this." 

 When she finished she sat there and waited for me to say something. What could I say? It didn't matter how it happened, the fact was that it did happen. It happened and I was forced to watch. "Okay, so you didn't do it on purpose, but how am I supposed to live with it? How do I look at you everyday and not see black cock going into your mouth, your ass and your pussy while you scream out how good it feels and beg for more?"  

 

 ****** Dave's Reunion ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "I have to live with the same memories." 

 "Yeah, you lived it, but you loved it. You might not have wanted to do it, but you did, and your memories are going to be good ones. You will think back and remember that you had never been so thoroughly satisfied. Every time you see a black man it will trigger the memory and you will get a warm fuzzy feeling. You can say bullshit, but you just got through reminding me how sexual you are. Every time I see a black man my memories are going to be of being tied to a chair and forced to watch you be a black cock-loving slut. I will always see you begging for it and I don't know that I can live with that." 

 +++++ 

 But we talked and talked and Julie and I were able to put the marriage back together and it lasted all of another three years. Then one day I came home from work early and found her bouncing up and down on Billy's dick while Ben was buried in her ass and Bobby Joe was occupying her mouth. Julie tried to get me to buy a rape story, but in her haste to get down to fucking she had neglected to clear a message off of our answering machine. 

 "Julie baby, how you doing? Bobby Joe and me are in town and we are having lunch with Ben. It's been almost three months since I've had your hot mouth on my cock and Ben suggested we call you and see if it's okay for us to come with him when he comes for his regular nooner. Give us a call at 555-1333 and we can be there in fifteen." 

 Bobby Joe had been telling me the truth at the reunion and Julie and Ben had gotten together and concocted their story so as to get Julie back into my good graces. I tossed her ass out and I haven't spoken to her in a year. She still calls me at least once a week, but I don't take the calls. I get an occasional letter from her that I do read just out of curiosity. She swears she loves me and only me and can we please get back together. Like I said, I read them, but then I throw them away. Report_Story
