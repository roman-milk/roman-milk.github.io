Patty Screws Up
===============
#1 

 

 

===

It started with an innocent request: "Feel up to going to a party with me and having a drink or two?" 

 It wasn't the first time that Janis had asked me that, but I'd usually said no in the past. Janis wasn't looking to hustle me, she just wanted company at another affair that she really didn't want to go to anyway. Janis, my boss, was a political animal and as such she always felt the need to put in an appearance at parties and events that our customers and suppliers put on. 

 Janis was a stone fox and Janis alone at one of those affairs was a green light for every guy there to take a shot at her. She was very capable of handling herself, but as I said, she was a politically minded person and she always worried about upsetting someone who might have been important to our company. You know what I mean; she puts down some obnoxious asshole and it turns out that he is the favorite son of a good customer. The son tells daddy, "That bitch was mean to me" and you can see where it might go from there. 

 The solution to that problem, as far as Janis was concerned, was to not go to those kinds of events alone. I'd gone to a dozen or so with her and she had stayed long enough to see and be seen and then we would leave and she would go her way and I would go mine. 

 Then I met Patty, fell in love with her, convinced her that life without me would be barren and bleak and we got married. That put an end to my attending parties with Janis. 

 That night I said yes not realizing that by doing so I was going to radically change my life. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The day started out like a hundred others had. Patty and I woke up, made leisurely love, took showers, dressed and went downstairs for breakfast. After breakfast we both got ready to leave for work. Patty walked with me to the front door, I put my suitcase down and she gave me a hug and a passionate kiss and told me to keep my thoughts on her while I was gone. 

 I have a very good job and I make very good money, but one of the unfortunate aspects of my job is that I occasionally have to travel and I was leaving on a two-day business trip. Patty kissed me again and then said: 

 "Don't forget that I might not be home tonight when you call." 

 I must have gotten a confused look on my face because she said: 

 "You did forget, didn't you? I told you I was having dinner with my mother and sister tonight, remember?" 

 "Oh yeah, I guess I did forget." 

 "I'll probably be home by ten-thirty or eleven, but I can't promise. You know my mother when she gets to talking." 

 One more kiss and I left. 

 My flight wasn't until two that afternoon so I spent the morning working at the office and at eleven-thirty I headed for the airport. I was sitting in the boarding area when the announcement was made that there would be a slight delay because of a mechanical problem. To shorten the story some, four delay announcements later it was announced that the flight was cancelled. I called Chicago and told them that I wouldn't be there until the next day and I left the airport. 

 I had to go right by the office on my way home so I stopped in to check on some paperwork. Janis was still there and she asked me if I would go to a cocktail party with her. Knowing that Patty would be having dinner with her mother and sister and not feeling up to going home to an empty house I said I would. Knowing Janis, I knew she wouldn't stay at the party very long and I would be home by ten. I might beat Patty home or I might not, but either way it would be a surprise to her. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The party was a cocktail party put on by one of our customers in conjunction with a trade show that was being held at the downtown Hilton. It was being held in one of the hotel's convention rooms and there must have been a hundred people there. I was off to one side of the room standing with Janis as she talked to someone she knew. I was staring at the other side of the room when Janis dug an elbow in my side. 

 "Earth to Rob, come in please." 

 That got my attention and I turned to look at her and saw that the person she had been talking to had moved away. 

 "What are you staring at?" she asked. 

 "My day and my life turning to shit." 

 "What?" 

 "You have never met Patty, have you?" 

 "No. Every time she's been to the office I have been gone somewhere." 

 "Well tonight you are going to get to meet her. Look over at the bar. See the redhead hanging on the arm of the guy in the gray sharkskin suit?" 

 "Yes." 

 "That is Patty, but the guy in the suit is not the mother and sister she was supposed to be having dinner with." 

 "Oh shit Rob, promise me you won't kill him." 

 I looked at Janis confused and she said, "You don't know who he is?" 

 I shook my head no. 

 "That's Randy Trumbull, the son of Jason Trumbull, as in Trumbull Industries? One of our biggest customers?" 

 "And that is supposed to mean he gets a free pass for being with my wife?" 

 "Oh come on Rob, I'm sure there is some reasonable explanation for it." 

 The words were no sooner out of her mouth than Randy bent his head and Patty turned hers up and they kissed. A long, lingering kiss and as he kissed her his hand dropped to her ass and stayed there. 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Depends on how bad you don't want me to kill the both of them here in public." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "If you want me to keep this civilized here is what I want you to do." 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 "Randy," Janis said as we walked up to them, "How nice to see you." 

 "Hello Janis, you are looking as lovely as ever." 

 "Well thank you sir. Who is your lovely partner?" 

 "This is my girlfriend Patty." 

 "Oh you devil you. A married woman for a girlfriend. How deliciously wicked of you." 

 "Oh, you mean the rings. Actually Patty is going through a divorce and she says she won't take them off until the divorce is final." 

 He turned to Patty and said, "Isn't that right honey?" 

 It was only then that he saw her standing there like a stone statue and with a face that was pale and ashen. "Is something wrong sweetie?" he asked. 

 "I think she is just a little surprised and she isn't the only one" Janis said. She turned to me and said, "You didn't tell me anything about a divorce Rob." 

 "I'm just as surprised as you are Janis. I sure didn't know about it when I left the house this morning to catch my flight. It is just amazing the things you can learn when your flight gets cancelled." 

 Randy turned to us with a confused look on his face and Janis said: 

 "Oh heavens, where are my manners. Randy, this is Rob Thomas, Rob meet Randy Trumbull." 

 I stuck out my hand to shake and Randy took it as Janis said, "Rob is Patty's husband, or was I guess I should say seeing as how he is getting divorced." 

 "Nice meeting you Randy. Be careful she doesn't stick it to you like she stuck it to me. Come on Janis, we still have some people to see and then I need to get a hotel room for the night." 

 "Bye Randy, we'll talk later," Janis said and we turned and walked away from them. 

 As soon as we were away from them Janis said, "I'm ready to leave now if you are." 

 "Actually I'm in no hurry to leave. I'd like to stick around and ruin their evening." 

 "You promised me Rob." 

 "All I'm going to do is be here. My being here should make them uncomfortable as hell. I want to stay until they leave. You go do your thing Janis, I'll just hang around, nurse a drink and keep watching them to see how nervous I can make them." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 I was at the bar getting a fresh drink when Randy came up and stood next to me. He gave me a nervous look and then said: 

 "This is a little awkward for me. I don't know how to handle a situation like this." 

 "Well, if it helps any it is new to me too." 

 "All I can say is that I didn't know she was married. I mean I knew she was still married, but I believed her when she told me she was going through a divorce and that it wasn't final yet. You weren't kidding me, were you? You really aren't getting a divorce?" 

 "The first I heard of it was from you. When I left the house this morning I got a passionate kiss and a "Hurry home lover." If my flight hadn't been cancelled I wouldn't have been here tonight and I would have never known. Where is she?" 

 "She went to the ladies room." 

 "How long has the affair been going on?" 

 "Almost three months now, but I wouldn't call it an affair." 

 "Why not?" 

 "All we have done is dated and we've had some pretty intense make out sessions, but she has refused to let me make love to her. It's like the deal with the rings. Just as she said she wouldn't take the rings off until the divorce was final she wouldn't have sex until then either." 

 "But you tried right?" 

 "Oh boy did I ever." 

 "What has she been telling you about when the divorce would be final?" 

 "She didn't know when it was going to happen. She said you were fighting it and constantly throwing up road blocks." 

 "I guess you had better get back to her. She's bound to be out of the john and looking for you by now." 

 "You aren't taking her home with you?" 

 "Nope." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Get a room for the night, leave on my trip in the morning and see a lawyer when I get back home from it. Stick around, I'm not throwing up roadblocks any more and I think in this state a divorce can become final in as little as sixty days. Take care" I said and then I walked away to find Janis. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 "I saw you talking to Randy," she said as I walked up to her. "It didn't look like angry words were spoken." 

 "There weren't. Basically he was apologetic. He didn't know she was lying to him." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Turn her pretend divorce into a real one." 

 "Not going to sit down and talk with her first?" 

 "No need. According to Randy they have been keeping company for three months now. That's all I need to know." 

 "You about ready to go?" 

 "Yeah. I just need to hit the john first." 

 I headed for the men's room, took my whiz and when I came out I found Patty waiting for me. She looked like she wanted to rush to me and throw her arms around me, but the look on my face must have given her pause and then I said harshly: 

 "What do you want?" 

 "You said you were going to get a hotel room. Why aren't you coming home?" 

 "What? And ruin it for you and your lover? Isn't that where you fuck him? In my house and on my bed?" 

 "It isn't like that. I need to explain Rob, it isn't what you think honey, honest it isn't." 

 "How the hell can it not be what I think? You tell me you are spending the evening with your mother and sister and I catch you out with another man. I see you kiss him and then he tells me that you are his girlfriend and it isn't what I think? Get serious Patty! Just get the fuck away from me. Go find your boyfriend. You are starting to make me feel guilty for ruining your date." 

 "Please Rob, let me explain" she was saying as I walked away from her. I found Janis waiting for me by the door and we left. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I sat staring out the window as Janis drove and it was a minute or so before I noticed. 

 "Hey boss, you are going the wrong way. The office is the other way." 

 "We aren't going to the office." 

 "But that's where my car is. I have to pick it up and go find me a hotel room." 

 "You aren't going to be staying in a hotel room. I'm taking you to my place." 

 "I don't think that is such a good idea Janis." 

 "I think it is an excellent idea. I want you where I can keep an eye on you. If you go to a hotel room you will sit there and stew about your wife and God only knows what you might do. I need you on that plane tomorrow so you can straighten out the McDougal account, not sitting in a jail somewhere charged with spousal abuse or assault and battery." 

 "I wouldn't do anything like that." 

 "I'll still feel better if you are with me." 

 Why fight it. I wasn't going to get any sleep anyway. Janis had a two-bedroom condo and she put me in the guest bedroom and said goodnight. I climbed into bed, tossed and turned for a while and then, just as I knew I would, ended up lying on my back and staring up at the ceiling wondering what had gone wrong between Patty and me. To be honest with myself I guess that deep down I knew that this day would eventually come. I had hoped and prayed that it wouldn't, but I knew that it would. Patty was just too wild, too much of a free spirit. I guess the big surprise should have been that she had kept it suppressed as long as she had. 

 I remembered the night I met Patty. It was at a birthday party being held for my cousin Lou. I knew who Patty was, I'd seen her around campus a lot and I'd heard all the stories and rumors about her. That she had pulled trains at the Kappa Phi house and that on a dare she had dated and fucked every member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, but they were just rumors and I didn't believe any of them. You only had to look at her to know they were bullshit. No one that sweet, young and innocent looking could possibly have done what she was supposed to have done. 

 I was at the party with my girlfriend Stella and I just happened to be looking at the front door when Patty and her date came in. There was something about her that drew my attention that night and from the time she got there I couldn't take my eyes off of her. It was maybe an hour into the party when it happened. I was looking at her across the room and she looked my way and our eyes met. Neither of us looked away something passed between us and after several seconds she left the people she was talking to and walked my way. She walked right up to me and said: 

 "Did you feel it too?" 

 "Yes I did." 

 "Then let's get out of here." 

 "What about your date?" 

 "Fuck him." 

 "I can't just leave. My girlfriend is here with me." 

 "To hell with her too. She was history when our eyes met. Come on, let's go." 

 She took my hand in hers and led me away. Once outside she asked me where I lived and when I told her she said: 

 "My place is closer." 

 As we got in my car she slid over next to me, her hand went to my zipper and she said: 

 "I have never believed in that 'love at first sight' bullshit, but what just happened is what it must be like. That or lust." 

 We hadn't gone three blocks before her head bent toward my lap and my cock was in her mouth. All of my pre-conceived notions about Patty really being sweet, young and innocent disappeared in about five seconds. No one who could suck a cock the way she sucked mine could be inexperienced. 

 She took it in her hands and rubbed the shaft with her fingers, her nails lightly dragging along the underside. She ran her tongue up and down on it several times before licking the head and then taking it in her mouth. Her head bobbed up and down taking a little more of me in on each down stroke until I felt the head of my dick hit the back of her throat. Her tongue slithered around on my cock. I kept one hand on the wheel and the other went to the back of her head and held it as I arched up off the seat to face fuck her. I moaned that I was going to cum and she clamped her lips tight around me and held me while I erupted. I felt her throat flutter as she swallowed every drop and then when no more spurts came she took her mouth off me, looked up at me and winked. 

 "I like to get the first one out of the way baby, it makes the second one last a lot longer." 

 When we got to her apartment she led me straight into the bedroom and stripped off her sexy little black dress and kicked it to the side. She wasn't wearing a bra and she slid her skimpy thong off as I dropped my trousers to the floor. My cock throbbed as I saw her standing there in high heels and thigh highs and she moaned: 

 "Hurry baby, hurry, I need it, I need it bad" as she climbed onto the bed. 

 I followed her and pushed her legs apart and moved between them and then put them on my shoulders. She reached for my cock and pulled it to her pussy lips and I pushed it in slowly. She hissed out a "Yessss" as I sank into her inch by inch and when my balls hit her pubic bone I started slowly fucking her. She pushed up at me to meet my downward strokes. Her nails were digging into my back as she tried to pull me deeper into her. I went harder and faster as she moaned and begged me to make her cum. I reached under her and gripped the cheeks of her ass and pulled her tight to me and then slammed into her as hard as I could and she cried out: 

 "Oh shit! Oh fuck! Oh yessssss" as she had her orgasm and my whole body shook as the cum burst out of the head of my cock and flooded her insides. I pulled out and fell to the bed beside her and almost as quickly sat back up. 

 "Oh sweet fucking Jesus. I'm sorry, oh god I'm sorry." 

 "About what lover?" 

 "I didn't pull out. I didn't have a condom on and I didn't pull out." 

 She laughed and said, "Don't sweat it lover, I'm on the pill and I have my diaphragm in." Just one more thing that told me that she was not the sweet innocent I had talked myself into believing she was. 

 We made love twice more that night and once more the next morning before I had to run for class. Before I left we made arrangements to meet again that night and after that every spare minute I had was spent with her. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was wild. Patty was a thrill seeker. She loved taking chances. It didn't matter where we went or what we were doing Patty turned it into a sexual adventure. On the back seat of her car in a Wal-Mart parking lot in broad daylight. Giving me a hand job as we sat side by side in a booth in one of the best restaurants in town. Blow jobs while driving down the street. Bent forward over a sink taking me from behind in a popular country western bar. Those and a hundred others like them were common fare for Patty. It was the most exhilarating time of my life and it was also the most dangerous. If the cops had caught us just once I would have been ruined career wise. So there I was, scared to death half the time and the other half I was on a high that was not to be believed. 

 Then there was a little bump in the road. There was a death in my family and I had to go home for two weeks. When I came back I heard rumors that while I was gone Patty had pulled a couple of trains at the Sigma Phi Epsilon house. I had been exposed to Patty's wildness and it was something that I wouldn't have put past her, but I never could find out for sure if the rumors had any substance although some of the Sigma Phi's that I knew did seem to be avoiding me. 

 Graduation was fast approaching and one night Patty asked me when I was going to get around to marrying her. When I didn't immediately fall to my knees and propose she got all quiet and then said: 

 "What's wrong Rob? Why are you looking at me that way?" 

 "I guess I never thought about it." 

 "Why not?" 

 I was silent for a bit and she asked again, "Why not Rob?" 

 "I guess I just never thought of you as the marrying kind." 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "You're too wild; too unpredictable, I just can't see you settling down to become a wife and a mother." 

 "My wildness hasn't seemed to bother you up till now." 

 "Oh it bothers me Patty, it bothers me a lot, but I've gone along with it because I never thought it would last. Marriage is forever Patty, and my heart, even as young as it is could not take what we have been doing forever. I spend half my time scared to death that we are going to get caught and go to jail and I'll end watching my career going into the toilet." 

 "Why didn't you say something? I'm only doing what you seemed to want to do. All you had to do was say, "Whoa up girl" and I would have stopped. You sow your wild oats when you are young honey, but I know there comes a time when you have to stop and grow up." 

 Just that quick the wildness was gone, but deep down in my heart I knew it was still there. It was suppressed, but it was still there, but I loved Patty and I pushed the worry aside and we got married.

++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I finally fell asleep, but it was a fitful sleep and I tossed and turned a lot. I had some bad dreams about Patty. I kept seeing her and Randy. My mind relived everything way out that Patty and I had ever done, only it wasn't me that I saw doing those things with Patty, it was Randy. 

 I woke up with a warm body next to me on the bed and for a moment I thought I was home in bed with Patty. I turned my head and saw Janis lying next to me. My movement woke her up and she opened her eyes and looked at me. 

 "Good morning," she said, "How are you feeling?" 

 "I'm awake and very surprised to see you here." 

 "I thought it might help quiet you down some." 

 "Quiet me down?" 

 "You were doing a lot of yelling and tossing and turning until I laid down with you." 

 "Given the dreams I was having you're lucky I didn't roll over and assault your virtue." 

 "My virtue is long gone sweetie and I'll tell you now that the only reason that I haven't tripped you and then beaten you to the floor is that I'm not a home wrecker. If you weren't married you and I would have been an item a long time ago." 

 "Really?" 

 "You bet sweetie. The only reason I'm not on top of you right now is that I can tell you still belong to your wife. You are pissed at her and God knows you have cause, but I don't see you ready to let go of her yet." 

 "Oh she's gone all right and as soon as I get back from my trip." 

 "Are you sure about that? You told me in the car that Randy said that they had never had sex. Maybe it was a platonic friendship." 

 "Did that kiss you saw them exchange look at all that sisterly to you? Did you not hear that, "this is my girlfriend" introduction? He told me that they had been seeing each other for three months. I know Patty and I know her sexual appetites. No way she went with him for three months and only held hands. All Randy was doing was showing how much he cared for her. He told that lie to try and help her out. I can almost like the guy." 

 "You are still tied to her sweetie and I think that deep down you want to stay tied to her, but if you do cut the cord I have a lot of room on my king size bed and I'm sure I can find you some space there. Why are you looking at me like that?" 

 "I'm just amazed at how stupid I can be sometimes." 

 "How so?" 

 "I always thought that...never mind." 

 "Oh no sweetie, finish it." 

 "I can't. It isn't nice." 

 "I have been exposed to "not nice" before and I have survived it. Come on, give." 

 "It's just that, well, in all the time I've known you I've never seen you with a man and since you are drop dead gorgeous I've kind of assumed that you were into girls." 

 "I am." 

 "You are?" 

 "I go both ways sweetie, and I'll probably keep going both ways until I find the one -- either sex -- that I want to settle down with. For what it is worth, I consider you a prime candidate, but like I said, I won't be a home wrecker. Come on, get your buns out of bed. You have a plane to catch." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I caught my flight, met with the client and then around four I called the office to give Janis a progress report. After filling her in on what was going on she said: 

 "Are you interested in some company?" 

 "Why? You thinking of coming to Chicago?" 

 "No, not me. Your wife was here about two hours ago. She wants to know where you are staying. She plans on jumping on an airplane and getting to you before you, and this is a direct quote, "Do something foolish." 

 "I already did something foolish. I married her when I knew that I shouldn't have." 

 "She seems desperate sweetie. I get the feeling that she loves you and is scared to death she is going to lose you. Anyway, I told her I had no idea where you were staying and that I wouldn't until you checked in and that even then I wouldn't tell her where you were unless you okayed it." 

 "I'll see her when I get home and that will be soon enough." 

 "Okay sweetie, you got it. Call me before you leave tomorrow and tell me that the client loves us, okay?" 

 I went out and got a bite to eat and then caught a movie. I got back to the hotel about ten-thirty and the phone was ringing when I walked in the door. I answered it and it was Patty. 

 "Rob? Thank God, I thought you would never answer." 

 "How did you find me Patty?" 

 "I went through all the expense reports in your filing cabinet and wrote down the names of all the hotels you have stayed at and then I started calling the ones in Chicago until I found where you were registered." 

 "What do you want Patty?" 

 "I want to talk to you Rob. I need to talk to you. I know what you are thinking, but you are wrong. I love you Rob and I'll crawl from here to there on my hands and knees to prove it if I have to. Please let me explain Rob, please." 

 "I'm in no mood to listen right now Patty. Maybe in a couple of days when I've cooled down a bit, but not now. I'll call you when I think I'll be able to sit down with you without wanting to put my hands around your throat and squeeze." 

 I hung up on her and then called the switchboard and told them to hold all calls. As I drifted off to sleep I wondered why Patty was so frantic to hang onto me when she obviously was so dissatisfied with me that she was running around with someone else. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day was a busy one for me and I got a lot done. I called Janis from the airport and told her that the client was happy and that I'd see her in the morning. 

 "What are you going to do when you get home?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Patty has called three times wanting to know when you will be back. You going to go home and have it out with her?" 

 "No. I'm still too pissed for that. I'll check into a hotel." 

 "Nonsense. You can stay at my place." 

 "No I can't. You might not want to put yourself in the position of a home wrecker, but I'm not sure that I can trust myself around you." 

 "Oh? Having lustful thoughts?" 

 "Always have had where you are concerned, but thinking lustful thoughts and doing something about it are two different things. I didn't act on those thoughts because I took my marriage vows seriously, but as far as I'm concerned Patty's action's have released me from my vows. I think a hotel is where I need to go." 

 "Your choice sweetie, but the offer is open." 

 "Thanks boss, but I have to take a pass, at least until this thing with Patty is over." 

 I flew home, checked into a hotel close to work and then settled in to work on the report I needed to turn in on my client meeting. The next day at work was like any other except for the nine phone calls from Patty. I kept hanging up on her, but she didn't seem to get the message. 

 After work I went to the hotel, watched some television and then went out to get a bite to eat. When I got back to the hotel I found an unpleasant surprise. I opened the door to my room and found Patty sitting on my bed. 

 "How the hell did you get in her?" 

 "I followed you from work and when you left I went to the desk, told them who I was and that I'd walked off and left my key card in the room." 

 "And they just gave you a card to get in?" 

 "I had to show them my driver's license and they compared it to your check in information. The last name and the address matched so they gave me the key card." 

 "What do you want?" 

 "I need to talk with you honey. I need to explain that what you are thinking is wrong." 

 "Fat chance you have of ever selling me on that." 

 "I know it looks bad for me Rob, but nothing ever happened between me and Randy." 

 "He says that you have been his girlfriend for three months and you are telling me that in three months nothing happened? Bullshit!" 

 "It's true Rob. Honest to God, I've never been to bed with Randy. He wanted me to and I did string him along, but we never did anything. I told him I wouldn't make love to him till after my divorce was final and you know that there never was a divorce. Please Rob, let me explain." 

 "Go ahead Patty, there isn't anything good on TV anyway, but I'll tell you now that you are wasting your time. It isn't likely that I will believe a word you say." 

 "Please Rob, believe me, this is the God's honest truth. It began three months ago when you were on that three-week business trip. You had been gone a week and I was so lonely that when a couple of girls from work asked me to stop after work with them for a drink I said yes. It was a Thursday night and we stopped at The Pink Poodle. They had a live band there that night and we had no sooner sat down than guys started coming up to us and asking us to dance. The other girls did, but I kept saying no. 

 "Two hours and several drinks later Randy came over and asked me to dance. By then I was tapping my toes to the music and squirming in my seat and what the hell, it was only a dance, so I said okay. He was a good dancer and he behaved himself and I felt comfortable with him so I danced several more times with him. He was good looking, fun to talk to and I enjoyed myself. He asked me if my husband got jealous when I danced with other men and it was then I decided to have some fun with him. I told him that I was in the process of getting divorced and wouldn't take my rings off until the divorce was final. 

 "Then he asked if he could see me again and for a kick I said yes. I had been living a quiet existence since we got married and a part of me missed the excitement we experienced when we were single so I thought I'd just kid around with Randy. He asked me to have dinner with him the next night and I said yes. We had dinner and went dancing and that evening he made a pass at me and I shot him down. I told him I was going to behave myself until my divorce became final. 

 "I had five dates with him while you were gone and when you got home I told him that I had to stop seeing him. When he pressed me on why I told him that I was getting too interested in him for my own good and that since I was still legally married and planned on staying a good girl until the divorce was final I had to stop seeing him. 

 "He kept calling me and I did have lunch with him a couple of times. Then you went on that one week trip to Atlanta and I had lunch with Randy the day after you left. He asked me to have dinner with him and I said yes. I dated him twice while you were gone and that set the pattern. He would ask me to have lunch with him a couple of times a week and at lunch he would always ask me to go out with him. I always said no unless you were out of town." 

 "Tell me about your dates. What did you do on them?" 

 "Just dinner and dancing and a few times we went to the movies." 

 "What else?" 

 "That's all Rob, honest." 

 "Oh come on Patty. Knowing you like I do why do I doubt that? No man invests that much time and energy in a woman, I don't care how beautiful she is, without getting something out of it." 

 "Well I did sort of string him along. He did think I was going to be his when the divorce was final, but you know it wasn't going to happen honey, you know there was no divorce." 

 "And just how did you string him along?" 

 "I did kiss him a few times." 

 "Patty, tell the fucking truth or get the hell out of here. I know you." 

 She looked away from me and then said, "We did do some pretty hot and heavy necking. He did get my tits out twice and I let him suck on them for a couple of minutes before I made him stop." 

 "And what else?" 

 "Please Rob, honest to god honey, I never slept with him." 

 "What else Patty?" 

 She took a deep breath, "He finger fucked me a couple of times and I gave him a hand job once." 

 I looked at her and just shook my head. 

 "That's all Rob, honest honey, that's all I did. I just wanted to have a little excitement in my life. It was a kick leading him on. All it was was fun Rob. I was never ever going to do him. I love you Rob and I would never do that to you. Please Rob, you have to believe me." 

 "That's the problem here Patty, I don't believe you. I know how sexual you are. I remember how wild you were before we got married and how you let it all hang out and I remember all the stories I heard about you and what you did in the frat houses. If Randy got your tits out no way he wasn't going to get more. If you had his cock in your hand no way is a hand job all he was going to get. As many times as I've had my fingers in your cunt you don't think I remember how you respond? If Randy finger fucked you he got a lot more than that." 

 "No Rob, no. Please honey, you have to believe me, he never had sex with me." 

 "Sorry Patty. The sad thing here is that you might be telling the truth, but based on the you that I know and the you that I knew before we got married I'm not buying it. Your little game, your quest for excitement has cost you your marriage. You can call Randy and tell him the divorce is in the works. Have lunch with him and date him all you want from now on. Now will you please just leave? I don't want to have to look at you."

 The divorce was final last month and I have no idea where Patty is or what she is doing. I saw Randy at a trade show and asked him how he and Patty were getting along and he told me that he hadn't seen her since the night I'd caught them together. 

 Janis and I are keeping fairly steady company and I think it might be getting serious between us. She keeps after me to move in with her, but as much as the idea appeals to me my marriage to Patty has left a sour taste in my mouth and I don't know that I'm up to living with someone else just yet. Maybe in a couple of months. Report_Story
