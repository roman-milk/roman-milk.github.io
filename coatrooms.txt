 ****** Coatrooms ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© The wife and I hadn't been getting along for some time. I'll have to accept half the blame, but only half and in truth I guess ten percent would be the more accurate number. My contribution to the problem consisted of my inability to believe that Nan hadn't cheated on me. She swore she hadn't and I just didn't believe her. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We had been at her company Christmas party and there was ample booze flowing. Nan gets a little loose when she gets some alcohol in her and it sometimes can be fun to watch her when she becomes the life of the party. I have two left feet and don't care to dance, but Nan would live on the dance floor if she could and that night was no exception. She danced with anyone who asked her. She got kissed by damned near every man she danced with if he got her under the mistletoe. It was her party and she was enjoying herself so I just sat back and watched. 

 I hadn't paid much attention at the time, but looking back on it, it seemed that for every dance she had with someone else she had two with her boss Brian. I did notice, but I thought nothing of it at the time, that three times when she danced with Brian he had maneuvered her (or she him) under the mistletoe. 

 I had been taking pictures and about three hours into the party I ran out of film. I had another two rolls in my overcoat pocket so I had gotten up and gone to the coatroom to get it. My coat was in the back and I was fishing in the pockets for the film when I overheard two women talking. 

 "Can you believe it? And right in front of her husband too." 

 "He must be blind." 

 "Maybe he is too busy taking pictures to see what she and Brian have been doing." 

 "Everyone can see it. Of course everyone else here knows what goes on in Brian's office over lunch hour." 

 They walked away; I found the film and went back to our table. Nan was sitting there and she asked me where I had gone and I told her that I had gone to get more film. I love gossip as much as the next person and I was just getting ready to ask her who it was that Brian was having an affair with when one of her co-workers came up and asked her to dance. I made a mental note to pump her for the dirt on the way home. 

 Another hour went by. I hadn't been paying all that much attention to Nan since she was always out on the dance floor and I'd lost track of her. I had gone to take a leak and I was just coming out of the bathroom when I saw Nan come out of a room just down the hall and hurry back toward the ballroom. I couldn't be sure, but it looked like she had been buttoning her blouse as she walked out. I stood there and watched her walk down the hallway back to the ballroom and wondered if I had really seen what I thought I had. 

 I don't know why I did it, curiosity I suppose, but I walked over to the room that Nan had come out of and opened the door and looked in. There was a man standing there with his back to me, his right arm was moving and I heard the sound of a zipper being pulled up or down. He turned around and I saw that it was Brian. 

 "I was looking for Nan. Someone told me they had seen her come in here." 

 "They must have been mistaken. She hasn't been here." 

 "I can see that. Sorry to have barged in on you." 

 While I had been talking a quick glance had shown me that his zipper was up. I turned and headed back to our table. Nan came out of that room and he said she hadn't been there. She had been buttoning her blouse and he was pulling up his zipper and I was starting to have a bad feeling. Five minutes later Brian came back into the room and as soon as I saw him sit down I got up and went back to the room where I had seen him, went inside and looked around. 

 It was obviously a meeting room. There was a long rectangular table with eight chairs around it, a wastebasket in the corner and nothing else. I looked at the table in the area where Brian had been standing and saw that two chairs in that area had been pushed apart to create a space and on the table in front of that space were some wet spots - pale, almost milky white wet spots. I walked to the spot and looked down and in my minds eye I could see it. Nan on her back and Brian fucking her and their juices dropping down on the table. 

 From where I was standing I could see into the wastebasket and I noticed a touch of pink and when I looked closer I saw it was a white handkerchief with the pink initials NCD on it. It was from a set of six that I had given Nan for her birthday. I picked it up and it was wet. I sniffed it and I smelt pussy, wet pussy with just a trace of something else that I was willing to bet was Brian's cum and that generated another picture in my mind. The two had finished fucking and Nan had stood up and had used her handkerchief to wipe herself and then she had tossed it in the trash. 

 I stood there as my brain took in all the information, collated it, and looked at it from several angles. 

 - The women I'd overheard when I was in the coatroom. - All the dances she had with Brian and the kisses under the mistletoe. - Nan buttoning her blouse as she came out of the room. - Brian zipping up when I cam into the room and Brian denying that Nan had been there. - Nan's handkerchief, wet with what I was sure was Brian's cum and her pussy juice. 

 The conclusion I reached was that my wife was cheating on me with her boss. Not one shred of positive proof, but the circumstantial evidence, at least to me, was overwhelming. 

 I went back to the party and took my seat. I hadn't been gone more that five minutes and when I'd gone Nan had been on the dance floor with Todd and she was still out there with him. The music stopped as the band finished their last set of the night and Todd walked Nan back to the table. I looked at her closely to see if I could see some sign of what she had been up to, but I saw nothing. 

 Twenty minutes later Nan and I had our coats on and we were headed home. As soon as I pulled out of the parking lot I said: 

 "You have been holding out on me sweetie." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "You know I'm like an old woman when it comes to gossip" and then I told her about what I'd overheard while in the coatroom. "How come you never told me about that?" 

 She looked away from me and it was too dark in the car to see her expression as she said: 

 "I haven't heard anything like that." 

 I changed the subject. "You sure looked hot out there on the dance floor tonight and I'll bet I'm not the only one who thought so. I'll bet you left more than a few cocks hard tonight. I know I've got one from watching you. Why don't you slide over here next to me and let me show you?" 

 "Not tonight Rob. I'm exhausted and all I want to do is go home and go to bed." 

 "That's not fair." 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "All day long I've tried to make love o you and you kept telling me to wait until we got home tonight. I've been walking around with a stiffie all day waiting for the party to be over." 

 "I'm sorry honey. I'll make it up to you tomorrow." 

 "You sure that you don't have another reason for not wanting to make love to me tonight?" 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "Think about it sweetie, just think about it." 

 "No Rob, I want to know what you are getting at." 

 "No you don't Nan, you don't want to know what I'm getting at. You really don't want to know. We'll go home and I'll sleep on it and see if I feel different tomorrow." 

 "No Rob, not tomorrow, now! I want to know right now." 

 "Okay Nan, you want it now, you got it. I think you don't want to make love tonight because you don't dare let me get anywhere near your pussy. You don't want me to discover that I wouldn't be the first one to use it tonight." 

 "Just what the hell are you accusing me of?" 

 "I'm accusing you of cheating on me Nan. I'm accusing you of having fucked Brian tonight at the party and I'm accusing you of being the women that the ladies were talking about when I was in the coatroom getting my film." 

 "How dare you! You are out of your fucking mind." 

 "Am I? Well let me run it down for you Nan." I told her everything I'd seen and what I'd found when I went back to the meeting room. "It's all there Nan. Your begging off on sex tonight is the final nail in the coffin. You don't dare let me find out for sure that I'd be getting sloppy seconds." 

 "That is just preposterous Rob. I don't know how you can believe that I would do that." 

 "Okay Nan, let's hear your explanation." 

 "First off, I told you that I've never heard anything about what goes on in Rob's office. Yes I danced with him a lot tonight, but since you don't or won't dance with me I dance with anyone who asks. So Brian asked me more often than anyone else, what does that prove? Kisses under the mistletoe are nothing new, it happens every year and you've never bitched about it before. We were in the room because Brian wanted to tell me privately that I was going to be made head of accounting after the first of the year. My hankie was in the trash can because I spilled my drink on the table and I used the hankie to wipe it up and then I didn't want to put the wet hankie in my purse so I threw it away. As far as my buttoning my blouse was concerned I think you imagined it. I have no idea what Brian was doing with his zipper." 

 "Why did he say that you hadn't been in the room?" 

 "Probably because he thought if you knew I'd been in there with him you would think the ridiculous thoughts you are thinking now. I've said all I'm going to on the matter. You can believe it or not and I don't much care." 

 The rest of the trip home was made in silence. Once in the house Nan went to our bedroom, grabbed a pillow and headed for the spare bedroom. I stripped, got in bed and lay there staring up at the ceiling until I fell asleep. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was sitting at the kitchen table sipping coffee and reading the morning paper when Nan came into the room. She poured herself a cup of coffee and then went into the living room. I finished the paper, rinsed out my coffee cup and then went out into the garage to do an oil change on the car. That done, I went back into the house and got ready to watch some football. The game had just started when Nan came into the room and sat down. 

 "Did a nights sleep clear all of that nonsense out of your head?" 

 "I looked over at her, "No, in fact now I'm even more positive I was right. Three things Nan. I caught you in a lie, I've gone over in my mind what I saw and now I'm positive that I did see what I thought I saw and finally, your own actions last night after I confronted you." 

 "You are unreal Rob. What lie did you catch me in and what action of mine convinced you and what are you so sure that you saw?" 

 "The lie was over the handkerchief. Actually, it was two lies. The first was when you said you used it to wipe up a spilled drink. You drink scotch on the rocks and Brian as drinking vodka tonics. Neither of those is a milky white drink and the spots on the table were milky white - just like cum. I sniffed the hankie when I took it out of the wastebasket and it did not smell of alcohol; it smelled like pussy and sex and I've had my nose buried in your bush enough tomes to know the smell. If that wasn't enough, neither scotch nor vodka leave a crust when they dry. The hankie is up in my coat pocket and I checked it again this morning and it is crusty; just like it would be if you wiped your cunt with it after you and Brian finished fucking on that table. The second part of the lie is that you tossed it because you didn't want to put a wet rag in your purse. You weren't carrying a purse with you when you came out of that room. You didn't have anything in your hands when you came out of that room and I know this because I saw you use both hands to button your blouse. 

 "Lastly was what you did when we got home last night. Actually it was two things, what you did and what you didn't do. What you did was grab a pillow and get as far away from me as you could. You didn't dare take the chance that I would grab your cunt when we got in bed because you knew what I would find. What you didn't do was the other side of that same coin. All you had to do while you were being indignant was lift your skirt and tell me to check your cunt for myself. You could have told me to stick my fingers in it, get down and stick my nose in it, lick it and prove to myself that I was being a fool, but that isn't what you did is it? No Nan, you have been busted and the only thing left for me to do is decide what I'm going to do about it." 

 I got up and left the room. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We avoided each other for the next couple of days. During that time I wrestled with what to do. What complicated things was the fact that I loved Nan and had since the first day I had laid eyes on her. Until that stupid Christmas party I'd thought that she loved me as much as I loved her and that we had a great marriage. How did you just take fifteen years and walk away from it? I was between a rock and a hard place. I couldn't bear the thought of not being with her and I couldn't stand being around her. 

 It was in that frame of mind that I went to see a divorce lawyer. He was very up front about it. I had nothing to go on, proof wise, so any divorce would be a he said/she said affair and I would come out of the deal screwed. I made more than she did so I would end up paying alimony, everything we had we be split fifty/fifty and I would end up paying for both lawyers and the court costs out of my half. Even if I had proof Nan cheated things would not be much different. I could get out of paying alimony and her lawyer, but everything else would be pretty much the same. His advice to me was to work on putting the marriage back together. If I couldn't do that I should hire a private investigator to try and get the goods on her and then come back and see him. 

 I was sitting in the living room staring at nothing at all and sipping a beer and thinking over what the lawyer had told me when Nan came home from work. She came into the room, sat down and then just looked at me for a couple of minutes and then said: 

 "Rob, we can't go on like this. I know what you are thinking and you are wrong, but there is no way I can prove it to you. I could bring people from work to tell you I don't spend my lunch hours in Brian's office, but you wouldn't believe them because they are my friends. I could bring Brian to you and he would tell that nothing happened between us, but you wouldn't believe him either. I love you Rob and I don't want our marriage to go into the toilet. I need you to meet me half way." 

 "What the hell does that mean?" 

 "I quit my job today. I can't go work for Brian with you thinking what you are thinking. My marriage means more to me than that job. I need you to put your thoughts behind you and I need for you to forgive me in your mind even though I've done nothing I need to be forgiven for. Just say in your mind, "Okay, she screwed up, but she loves me and I forgive her." I do love you Rob, I do, and I don't want our marriage to go bust." 

 Well, I did love her and so I did forgive her, but I could never forget. We patched things up and got on with life, but things were never the same after that. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two years went by and Nan received the invitation to her class reunion. I didn't really want to go, but she kept after me about it until I finally caved in and agreed to go. It was a five-hour drive to get there and by the time the drive was over I had worked myself into believing I'd have an okay time. My class was two years ahead of Nan's, but I would know a few people there. 

 The first person I saw when I walked into the hotel ballroom was Michelle, a classmate of Nan's and an old girlfriend of mine. I guess I should really say a "special" old girlfriend of mine. She was dressed in a black cocktail dress that stopped just above her knees. In her black high heels she looked positively stunning. She was surrounded by a herd of ex-jocks that looked like they had let themselves go to seed. 

 I felt a stirring in my pants as I thought back to the night at the drive-in movie when we had relieved each other of the burden of carrying around our virginities. I thought we had an undying love at the time, but two months later she dumped me for a college guy who later dumped her. She had tried to come back to me and I had pretty much told her to fuck off and die. Six months later I was off to college and hadn't seen her since. I wondered if she would recognize me and what she might do if she did. I remembered the day I told her to piss off and I remembered the slap I had gotten from her. 

 I did know some of the other people at the reunion, but none well enough to sit down and socialize with so I followed Nan's lead and sat where she sat and moved when she did. I was doing my usual, sitting and sipping my drink and taking pictures and Nan was doing her usual, drinking more than she should and staying out on the dance floor. 

 A steady stream of old boyfriends made their way to our table and asked her to dance. I noticed that she did dance more often and just a little bit closer with Bill Moser, her boyfriend before I came along. I had learned my lesson at the Christmas party and I kept a closer eye on Nan when we went to parties. I noticed when Nan and Bill strolled out the door together and after a couple of minutes I got up and followed. I didn't see them anywhere so I was going to have to go find them, but first nature called. 

 I went to the bathroom and when I came out I went down the hall checking doorknobs and putting my ear to the ones that were locked. As I neared the coatroom I heard a giggle. I moved quietly over to it and looked past the doorframe and saw Nan on her knees with her head moving toward Bill's cock and I watched her mouth close around it. Her tits were hanging out of the top of her dress and they swayed as her head moved back and forth on Bill's dick. I very quietly moved away and hurried back to our table and grabbed my camera and headed back to the coatroom. Just as I was leaving the ballroom Michelle intercepted me. 

 "Do you have any idea where your wife and my husband disappeared to?" 

 "Bill is your husband?" 

 "Unfortunately yes." 

 "Well kick off your heels and follow me. You need to be very quiet." 

 She kicked off her heels and we moved silently down to the coatroom. I peeked around the doorjamb and saw that Nan was still gobbling on Bill's cock. I took a quick step to the right and started taking pictures. As the flash went off Bill hollered, "What the fuck?" and Nan screamed and I just kept recording the event for posterity. Buy the time I had all the pictures I wanted Nan was crying and Michelle was calling Bill every nasty name in the book. I turned to walk away and Michelle called out, "Wait up Rob." I turned and watched as she put her heels back on and then walked toward me. 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Walk away from her sorry ass." 

 "Can I get a copy of those pictures?" 

 "As many as you want." 

 "What are you going to do right now?" 

 "Go back to the hotel, get my stuff and leave." 

 "What about Nan?" 

 "She can hitch hike or walk for all I care." 

 Bill and I take turns being the designated driver. This is his night to drink and mine to drive. Meet me for coffee somewhere?" 

 "Pick a place." 

 "The Denny's at Sixth and Wilmont?" 

 "It will be at least a half hour before I can get there. I need to get out of the hotel before the whore can catch up to me. I don't want to have to look at her anymore." 

 "Meet you there I thirty minutes." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I hit the hotel, grabbed my bags and stopped at the desk to check out. The man behind the counter said I had a message and he gave it to me. It was from Nan telling me not to do anything rash and to wait for her. I told him that the wife would still be there until check out time, paid the bill and then I left. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Coatrooms ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© Michelle was sitting in a booth when I got to Denny's and I joined her. We sat, drank coffee and made small talk for a while and then she said: 

 "I've never forgotten you. I've never forgiven you either for the way you talked to me when I tried to crawl back to you. Not that I didn't deserve it, but you could have been a little gentler." 

 "What can I say? I was young, the love of my life had just abandoned me for some meat-headed college jock and I was full of anger. If a couple of more months had gone by I might have been over it." 

 "The love of your life huh?" 

 "You will never know how crushed I was." 

 "While we are on the subject of love, where are you going from here?" 

 "Home to close accounts, cancel credit cards and see a lawyer." 

 "Not going to have a sit down with the little women?" 

 "Been there, done that and it didn't take. Remember the old, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Well this was the second time, at least the second time I know about. What about you?" 

 "We live in an apartment and it was his before we got married so I'll be moving out. I'll try to beat him to the bank in the morning and get to the safe deposit box. While waiting for you I electronically transferred everything out of our joint accounts to the account I had before we got married." 

 "Not going to talk to him either huh?" 

 "He's my third husband Rob and he knows that my first two are history because I caught them stepping out on me. He knew going into our marriage I would grant him no leeway in that area." 

 "How much stuff have you got? Will it all fit into one car?" 

 "I could get it all in my car and your car." 

 "Then lets do it." 

 We finished our coffee, drove to her apartment and in two hours we had moved out everything she wanted. 

 "What now?" I asked. 

 "Find a room, leave a wake up call for seven so I can be at the bank when it opens." 

 "What if he beats you there?" 

 "He won't. He'll go to the apartment and crash. I doubt he will even know I'm gone until he wakes up around ten or so. What about you?" 

 "Drive home and start preparing." 

 "Do you have to go right now?" 

 "Can't leave until we find a place for your stuff unless you want to leave your stuff in the cars and move to Colorado Springs." 

 "I don't have anything to hold me here. I suppose I could find a job in Colorado Springs. Hell! Why not! How are you on revenge?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I'm still going to need a place to stay until the morning. I really don't feel like being alone tonight. You could stay with me and we could do some getting even." 

 "I wouldn't mind doing that. I wouldn't mind at all." 

 We checked into a Days Inn and left a wake up call for seven that it turned out we never needed. We were up all night long. The door had no sooner closed behind us than Michelle was shedding clothes. I followed suit and she giggled as she saw my already erect cock and said: 

 "A little eager are we? Well come on sweetie, the ex love of your life is going to show you what you have missed all these years by not taking me back when you could have." 

 She reached out and took hold of my cock and led me over to the bed and had me sit down. She knelt in front of me and took me in her mouth and began licking and sucking on me. She sucked me deep into her mouth and gently rotated her head from side to side as she noisily slurped on me bathing my cock and balls with her saliva. She took my cock out of her mouth, looked up at me and smiled as she rubbed my cock on her face. 

 "You keep that up and I'm going to ruin your make up when I shoot." 

 "Oh we wouldn't want that," she said as she took me back in her mouth and gave my cock small licks and kisses and swirled her tongue around the shaft and head. "Oh God" I moaned and my hands went to the back of her head. My body shuddered as I let go in her mouth. She licked and sucked me until I was soft in her mouth and then I pulled her up on the bed and said: 

 "My turn now." 

 I bent down and kissed her lips. I pushed my tongue into her mouth and kissed her deeply and passionately. I reached between her thighs and my fingers stroked her pussy and I felt her wetness. I lowered my head and parted her pussy lips with my tongue and searched for her clit and when I found it I latched onto it with my lips and sucked on it for a minute and then I let it go. I worked two fingers into her wet box and slowly finger fucked her while my mouth went back to work on her clit. She was humping her hips up at me and moaning, "Oh, oh, oh, oh" as she had an orgasm. I licked her pussy from her clit to her asshole and she let out a long, low moan. I started pumping my fingers harder into her pussy and then I shoved a thumb in her ass. She arched up off the bed and screamed as she had another orgasm. I leaned down and kissed her mouth then broke the kiss and said: 

 "I hope you are ready because junior sure is" and I slid my cock into her hot cunt. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Michelle was standing outside the bank when it opened and twenty minutes later she was in her car behind me following me to Colorado Springs. My cell phone went off every fifteen minutes and I saw from caller ID that it was Nan so I ignored the calls. Thirty minutes out of the Springs I used my cell to call a locksmith and arranged for him to meet me at the house. Before leaving the motel where Michelle and I had stayed I asked her what kind of work she would be looking for and she told me she was a legal secretary. After I'd made arrangements with the locksmith I called our company lawyer and asked him if he knew anyone who needed an experienced legal secretary. 

 "Strange that you should ask that. Not five minutes ago Betty gave me two weeks notice. She is leaving to get married and she and he new hubby are relocating to Florida. Why do you ask?" 

 "I have a friend who is moving to the Springs and that is what she does." 

 "Have her give me a call." 

 "You to busy to talk right now?" 

 "No." 

 "Stay by your phone." 

 I disconnected and called Michelle on her cell, gave her Ben's number and told her to call him right away. 

 The locksmith was waiting when we got to the house and an hour later all the locks had been changed. Michelle told me she had an appointment to see Ben at three that afternoon. We found a storage place, rented a unit and unloaded both cars. 

 "The next step is to find a couple of apartments," I said. 

 "Why two? Last night seemed to show we are compatible; why not share one?" 

 "Maybe after the divorce, but until I get that out of the way I don't want to give Nan anything that she can use against me. We can get a motel room until you find out if Ben will hire you and then we can go apartment hunting." 

 "If you are going to live in an apartment why did you have the locks changed on your house?" 

 "To keep Nan out. I don't want her in there stripping the place bare. We will split everything fifty/fifty, but I intend to have a lot of say in what she gets as part of her fifty percent." 

 We got Michelle a room at Motel 6 and left her car there and I drove her over to Ben's office. I introduced them, told her I would be back for her later and then I left to run errands. I went to the bank and closed out all the accounts and opened new ones in my name only and then I cleaned out the safe deposit box that Nan and I both had access to and moved everything to a box in my name. I swung by my office and used my office phone to cancel all joint credit cards and then I headed back to Ben's office. 

 When I got there Ben was walking her around and showing her where everything was and I asked: 

 "Is that a good sign?" 

 "I hired her and she starts week after next. I wanted her next week, but she says she needs time to find an apartment and move in." 

 I drove her back to the motel and dropped her off and told her I would be back at seven to take her to dinner. My cell phone hadn't stopped going off what with Nan still trying to reach me so I finally took her call. 

 "Where are you?" 

 "I'm home." 

 "Why did you run off and leave me?" 

 "Stupid question Nan, given what you were doing in that coatroom." 

 "How am I supposed to get home?" 

 "Walk, hitch hike, catch a bus, talk Bill into driving you, I don't really care. When you get here you will need to give me a call so I can come let you in." 

 "Why do I need to do that?" 

 "Because I changed all the locks to keep you out. I don't want you in that house unless I'm there. I don't trust you not to try and strip the place. We will let the courts decide who gets whatever we can't agree on." 

 "The courts? What do the courts have to do with it?" 

 "That is where you end up when you get divorced." 

 "Divorce? Why are you talking divorce? There is no need for that honey. Okay, so I had too much to drink and I let myself get pushed into something I shouldn't have, but I love you Rob, you know I do. We will be okay. There isn't any need for a divorce." 

 "Sorry Nan, I got weak minded and let you get away with what you did with Brian. It isn't going to happen twice. Call me on my cell when you get back to town and I'll arrange to meet you at the house. Good-bye." 

 "Wait Rob, plea..." and I hung up on her. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I picked up Michelle at seven and we went to dinner. After dinner Michelle said: 

 "I feel in the mood for some more revenge, how about you?" 

 "Oh gosh, oh golly, I don't know if I can do such a thing." 

 "I'll suck your dick on the way back to the motel." 

 "Damn girl, you drive a hard bargain. Count me in." 

 I managed to get us to the motel without wrecking the car and then the night got busy. We undressed, sat on the bed holding each other and kissing. Her hand was stroking my cock and I had two fingers in her pussy when she said: 

 "I want you in my ass tonight." 

 "Okay by me" I said as she pulled away from me and walked over to her suitcase. She came back with a tube of KY Jelly and handed it to me. 

 "It has been a couple of weeks since Billy was there so you need to work at loosening me up." 

 She got on the bed on her knees and put her head down on a pillow. I lubed up my thumb and two fingers and when I pushed my thumb in her asshole I felt her sphincter try to grab it and hold it. I worked on her with the thumb for about a minute and then I took the thumb out and pushed one finger in and seconds later I put two of them in her. Another minute and I had her as loose as fingers were going to get her. I lubed up my cock with KY and put my cock head at her hole and slowly pushed. The head of my cock popped past the sphincter and I slowly started to work my way in and Michelle had a small orgasm. She trashed and moaned as I thrust in and pulled back. She was pushing her ass back at me and I reached under her and my fingers found her clit and began rubbing it. She went wild. I just held position as she rammed her ass on my cock, moved forward and rammed back again. 

 "Oh yes, oh God yes" she yelled as she had another orgasm. 

 She continued to pound back at me until I felt my own climax approaching. I pulled my hand away from her pussy, grabbed her hips with both hands and started fucking her hard. In less than a minute the cum boiled out of the end of my dick and splashed the insides of her butt. 

 She fell forward on the bed and rolled over and looked up at me. "Now what?" she asked. 

 "How about we shower, try a little sixty-nine and see where that leads us?" 

 "I do love the way you think," she said as she got off the bed, took my hand and led me to the shower.

 The next morning I saw a divorce lawyer and gave him the photos I'd taken of Nan in the coatroom with Bill and after that things took on a life of their own. Nan got back to town and I met her at the house. She did her best to try and talk me out of the divorce, telling me that she loved me and only me and that Bill had just been a drunken indiscretion. I told her I wasn't buying it, that I'd seen a lawyer and that she would be served with papers any day. Then we went through the house arguing over who got what and once we got that settled I got a U-Haul and moved what I wanted out. Then I gave the keys to the house to Nan and drove off. 

 Michelle and I had a fun filled two weeks before I told her that I couldn't see her again until after the divorce. She wasn't happy about it, but she understood why it had to be. It was a good thing that I made that decision because I found out later that Nan had hired a private detective to follow me and try and get something on me she could use to counteract the pictures I had of her and Bill. 

 Once the divorce was final I expected to have a relationship with Michelle, but that wasn't to be. The divorce took almost seven months and while I was busy staying away from her Michelle met and fell into a relationship with someone else. 

 Things came out pretty much as the lawyer I had seen after the Nan/Brian mess had told me they would. Everything was split evenly, but because of the circumstances I did not have to pay Nan alimony and I did not have to pay her attorney's fees, but I did get stuck with paying court costs. 

 It galled me that she was going to get half of my pension and half of my 401k, but the upside to that is she wouldn't get a dime of it until I retired and I still had twenty years to go before that happened. A lot could happen in twenty years. Hopefully I would wake up one morning and hear that she had been run over by a bus or had been run down by a drunk driver. A guy can only hope. Report_Story
