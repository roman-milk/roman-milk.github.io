 ****** Friend's Husband ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Wife and friend compete for the husband 

 "Another?" Dorothy said. 

 "Do you need to ask?" Elizabeth answered, holding out the wine glass. 

 "It's been too long. We should have kept in touch." 

 "You know how it is. A day goes nowhere. That's how I lost Harry, working too many hours." 

 Dorothy looked at her friend feeling sorry for her. They had been best friends in college with Elizabeth looking after her and still felt she owed her something. Her mother had died and the funeral brought her back to town. She opened another bottle of wine. 

 "Thanks for putting up with me. I needed to unwind and offload. You're a treasure." Elizabeth smiled. 

 Dorothy smiled back feeling a warm glow of happiness from being able to help. "I'm sloshed!" she giggled. "Not used to drinking these days." 

 "You never were." Elizabeth laughed back. "I haven't drunk like this in ages, nor had sex or such a laugh. No real friends over there." 

 "No sex? That's not like you!" 

 "Too much work," she sighed. 

 The front door closed and they heard the tramp of feet. "My lord and master arriving home from the pub." Dorothy explained. 

 He walked in and stopped with the door open not expecting company. 

 "My long lost friend Elizabeth," Dorothy said, pointing with a wavering arm. 

 He stared at the attractive blonde for a moment then recovered. "I'm Tom," he smiled. 

 He hesitated as the visitor was sitting in his comfy chair so sat on the sofa. Taking in the empty wine bottles he stated the obvious. "You've been drinking." 

 "Catching up on old times too," his wife told him. 

 He looked from one to the other noticing their legs pulled up on the easy chairs across from him. Their dresses were tucked up beneath them from casually lazing around. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed her friend giving him the once over. 

 "You too! At the pub, which one?" Elizabeth asked. 

 "The George and Dragon." 

 "Good grief I haven't been there in years." 

 "Nice legs," he smiled at his wife. He wasn't sure why he said it perhaps it was the presence of this attractive woman. Dorothy was wearing stockings for a change. He couldn't help noticing they both were as the stocking tops were showing. 

 She knew black stockings were a favorite of his so reached over for the bottle letting the dress ride up. "Stockings not just pull-ups," she said, meaningfully. 

 "Snap!" Elizabeth chirped in not wanting to be left out. She pulled up the hem of the dress far enough to show the suspenders eliciting giggles like naughty school girls. 

 They had worn black at the funeral and changed into something more casual on returning not bothering to change the underwear. Elizabeth welcomed the offer of staying the night and so there they were high from nostalgia and white wine. 

 "So who has the best legs then?" his wife teased him. 

 He looked away from her friend self-consciously as though caught with his hand in the sweet jar. "I don't know," he mumbled. 

 She got up from the easy chair pushing with both hands to stand unsteadily. She pulled the dress up to show off the black suspenders. "So who's got the best legs then?" she repeated. 

 Not drunk enough to make the mistake of answering he shrugged. "I haven't seen Elizabeth's so how could I tell," he said lamely. 

 Elizabeth arose from the chair as unsteady as her friend to lift her dress up, swaying a little. 

 He looked up at them knowing he shouldn't leer instead he tried to keep a neutral expression on his face. As though appraising fine wines he looked from one to the other. "Ok! Hold on, it's difficult. The stockings are nearly the same but the suspenders are different," he said, wanting to drag it out. 

 Elizabeth bent over to straighten the stockings smoothing them over her legs, pulling on the suspenders. The flash of creamy white thigh was certainly a bonus, working effectively on his decision. 

 "Hey that's cheating," his wife complained with a laugh. She too pulled at the stockings, straightening the seams, adjusted the straps of the suspender belt. She hoisted her skirt higher flashing a white triangle of panties. They were the usual sensible cotton knickers she wore but the fabric clung to her crotch capturing his stare. She was pleased with the effect. 

 Elizabeth not wanting to be outdone hoisted the dress up. She had always been game for a dare and hated losing. It was no accident showing off a pair of crimson silk French knickers. They were loose around the crotch revealing less than her friend's panties but all the more seductive for being tempting. The looseness suggested what was inside was easily accessible. 

 It was too much for him and he reluctantly answered the pestering women. "Elizabeth," he sighed. He threw his hands up in the air as though it had been a hard choice and it had been. They both had long shapely legs but the French knickers swung it, not that he was foolish enough to admit it. 

 "Yes! I win!" Elizabeth declared with glee. 

 To his surprise they still held their dresses up with the delectable sight of long legs encased in sheer black stockings. Their white thighs showed they hadn't tanned and the contrast was all the more alluring. 

 "Well I have the nicest bottom. I was voted best ass in college," Dorothy pouted petulantly. The nostalgic reminder of college friends, recounting stories, had worked upon them both. Life wasn't so much fun anymore, even though they were only thirty-five, they hungered for those carefree days. With the help of a glass or two of wine both women were regaining some of the flirty daring of back then. 

 Dorothy turned around to show him proffering a little wiggle of her bottom. 

 "Only because I was away that week." Elizabeth teased. 

 "Well then, let him decide." 

 Elizabeth grumbled about it but turned around to wiggle her bottom at him. He desperately wanted to rub his jeans where his cock was pressing hard against the fly. He stared at the two of them playfully bumping each others hips. His wife's panties were stretched between her cheeks. The French knickers too were tight in her crease but the bottom of the loose knickers swayed seductively with every wiggle. 

 They both had cute firm bottoms but his wife's was a perfect heart shape. The suspender belt with straps framed it magnificently. He couldn't keep his eyes off Elizabeth's ass though for this was a new experience. This evening would go down as one of, if not the most memorable day in his life. Here were two sexy women seductively wiggling their bottoms at him in the lounge. It just couldn't get any better than this. 

 After some friendly chatter between them Elizabeth must have sensed she was going to lose. She bent over grabbing both ankles trying to keep her legs straight but failing. "There! Can you still do this?" she asked. 

 "Hey, you're cheating again!" Dorothy complained. "Anything you can do I can do better. Keep those legs straight," she mocked her friend. 

 Tom's eyes opened wide in astonishment thinking his cock would grow out the top of his jeans. He knew they were enjoying teasing him but however much they had to drink they were women and would remain in control. If only though. Never mind, he had that wonderful heart shaped bottom all to himself upstairs later. 

 "Decide quickly I can't keep this up much longer," his wife puffed. They both found it difficult breathing bent over like that and so did he. He couldn't help noticing a tiny wet patch between the legs. He looked more closely between them both, all four legs. They were both excited! Maybe, just maybe there was chance, then dismissed the idea for he might cum right there on the sofa. 

 He was looking up at a pair of crotches with thighs spread open. They were gently swaying with the effort of standing up let alone being bent over straight legged. Like snakes they were swaying seductively charming him beyond control. 

 Being slightly drunk they carried on teasing him enjoying his embarrassment. They were delighted at his attention and his obvious arousal spurred the competition onward. 

 "I declare Dorothy the winner," he said with enthusiasm. He knew he had to do it but anyway it was true. He almost told them it was difficult to tell with their panties on but that might be pushing it and ruin the atmosphere. They were egging each other on so why spoil the show. 

 "Tom is a breast man," Dorothy announced. 

 "Well, I will beat you hands down," Elizabeth teased, "or do I mean hands full." 

 They looked at each other giggling. Elizabeth winked at her and pulled her dress up further with a look full of daring. Dorothy dropped the hem of her dress. Elizabeth smiled a look of victory but was surprised when her friend pulled the straps away from her shoulders to let the dress fall to the floor. 

 Unable to resist the challenge she pulled her dress up over her head to fling it across the chair with a flourish. 

 Dorothy looked at her friend's bra pushing the breasts into a deep cleavage. Her own sensible black bra didn't show them off so well and didn't even match her panties. Her husband couldn't keep his eyes off Elizabeth's cleavage. Although her breasts were bigger she stood still feeling outdone and just a little vulnerable. Dorothy was ready to give in and call a halt to the silliness. 

 Tom looked at two beautiful women standing right before him in their underwear. It was clear how excited they were from their own teasing game. All he had to do was sit back admiring their lithe bodies letting them play out their game. He sat forward a little trying to hide the erection in his jeans not wanting to seem over eager not wanting them to back down on the dare. His mind was desperately working trying to think of a way to encourage them without interrupting the flow of challenges they threw at each other. 

 One look at her friend's smug face turned it all around. "Mine are bigger you're just relying on a bra to show them off," Dorothy taunted. 

 "Well at least mine still stand up to the ravages of time," she shot back. 

 Dorothy looked huffy from the snide remark not knowing if she dare prove otherwise. They had both been topless at the beach but that had been a long time ago. 'Damn this is my home so why not,' she thought. 

 "I'll show you how well they stand up." Dorothy challenged. Reaching behind her back she struggled with the bra catch. 

 "Hold on you had better do this properly," Tom spoke up nervously. Dare he make a move? It might bring them to their senses calling a halt to the wonderful show. 

 The two friends turned on him as though he had stepped into a private fight. Reaching for the remote on a side table he fiddled with it finding a music channel. He looked up at them with such a pleasurable smile of anticipation lighting his face their mood changed. 

 Dorothy smiled and winked at her husband knowing she would win this round. It had been awhile since she had danced for him but remembered the moves. She swung her hips with the rhythm of the music separating her stocking clad feet. She lifted her hair, wet her lips with a flick of the tongue and started to gyrate her hips with eyes half closed. She bent forward jiggling her large pendulous breasts at her husband. 

 Elizabeth was left standing. "OK! Go for it girl," she laughed. She just couldn't resist joining in the fun so began mimicking the moves. She turned around and wiggled her ass at him and slapped both panty clad cheeks with her hands. 

 She seemed to be inviting him to slap her ass but he dare not provoke his wife or it might just end right there. He knew they were challenging each other rather than dancing for him. He could only observe from a safe distance, but what a show. He would fantasize over this for a long time to come. They were swaying a little almost toppling leading him to wish they would both land on the sofa with him. 

 "Undo me will you," Dorothy asked, turning her back. She held onto the cups and bent toward her husband to gain his full attention. Dropping the bra she held her bare breasts in both hands unable to completely cover the large soft mounds. It was naughty and doing something to an already invigorated sensuousness but this was her husband so what did it matter. She was determined to knock Elizabeth out of the ring. 

 Dancing before him in her panties trying to cover her breasts and failing his wife and her wonderful breasts filled his vision. His cock ached so much all he wanted to do was grab her to drag the luscious bitch upstairs to bed. 

 It was a good job he didn't because her friend wasn't to be outdone. She slipped off the bra unnoticed until she bumped her friend's hip with hers. They laughed together bumping away still holding onto their breasts pretending to hold on to a semblance of decorum. They turned toward each other letting go as they pushed close. Their breasts pressed against each other showing both were standing up firm with hard nipples. 

 "See! They don't sag," Dorothy proudly boasted. The music carried on one track leading into another leaving them breathing hard still moving to the rhythm. They lent back, revealing their breasts, shimmying to the music, wiggling the delicious firm orbs. With shoulders shaking their breasts they tried to outdo each other. They leaned in to press hard swollen nipples together; they laughed at the audacity of the naughty erotic moves. 

 A slow number gave them some relief from the exertion and they wrapped arms around each other propping each other up. "I'm beyond the point of no return Dotty. I need a man desperately," she whispered into her friend's ear. 

 "We'll have to see who wins him then," she replied with a devilish grin. They turned their heads toward the victim. Dorothy knew her breasts would win her man but she also felt sorry for Elizabeth. Could she let her have him? It might work to her benefit over the next months or even years. 

 Surely she didn't mean it. It was the drink talking. Elizabeth licked her lips at the thought of his cock. A wistful look in her pale blue eyes made it appear twice the size becoming so much more desirable. 

 Tom almost slavered at the sight of these two gorgeous women in an erotic dance. They moved slowly with arms entwined looking at him with wet lips parted. He dare not think about those open pouting mouths otherwise he would cum in his trousers. He looked at their breasts momentarily touching nipples in time with the music. They were swollen from the heat of the moment. Their bodies glistened with a fine sheen of perspiration. 

 They stopped dancing and stood with hands on their hips thrusting out their breasts. "Well? Who has the best breasts?" they chorused. 

 He had enough time to think it through despite a lack of blood flow to his brain. Desperation had formulated a plan. "If you get on all fours I can judge them better," he said with a hoarse whisper just above the sound of the music. 

 With some relief from the effort of dancing they helped each other to the floor. They were both sloshed and fell inelegantly at his feet. Laughing uncontrollably they presented themselves for his inspection. Elizabeth knew her breasts were larger and to her husbands taste for he had savored them often. 

 She tried to knock her friend over so Elizabeth shoved back with a fit of laughter flooring them both. They helped each other up attempting to remain serious despite the ridiculousness of the game. On hands and knees they looked up at him through long eyelashes straight between his legs. The hardness of his cock had been obvious but from that angle it looked so much bigger. 

 Elizabeth broke first. "Please sir, do I have the best tits, sir," she said, with a mock schoolgirl tone of voice. They leant against each other in a fit of giggles. 

 Dorothy took up the theme. "Please sir. Tell Lizzy my tits are best. Tell her you would prefer to fondle mine," she giggled. Both friends took up the teasing refrain repeating the words together, "Go on sir fondle my tits." 

 He hobbled around behind them with a raging stiff cock and knelt. A good look at their crotch confirmed they were excited as much as he was from the wetness of their panties. The odor from the bitches on heat rose up at him. He was so close to just forcing himself on them like a dog he desperately wanted these hot bitches. 

 They continued to taunt him. "Go on sir, fondle my breasts, I want to pass the test," they said with variations on a theme between drunken giggles. 

 He wasn't listening just positioning himself behind one of them. They were hip to hip leaning against each other for support. He reached around a body and took hold of a pair of large breasts kneading them in his hands with fingers gripping tight as his wife liked to be handled. She sighed loudly cutting off her friends girly teasing. 

 He shuffled sideways to press himself against her friend. The hardness in his jeans pressed between her cheeks. With fingers outstretched he rubbed the palm of his hand over her taught nipples. She too sighed. He pinched them gently and pulled on them. 

 It was a turn-on having her breasts fondled but now they seemed to be a bell pull directly to her vagina, ringing loudly in her ears. The tune was, 'fuck me please fuck me now'. Her body was shouting, 'I want it now,' and her lips smacked in anticipation. 

 Dorothy had already been in a high state of arousal but watching her husband fondling a friend's breasts brought the excitement to an overpowering level. Her own sense of respectability had fallen and she assumed Elizabeth's had too. She wanted Tom to show her friend what a stud she had. 

 Feeling Elizabeth press back against him he pulled harder while pinching her nipples. She rubbed her bottom up and down the bulge in his jeans while he squeezed her breasts and nipples hard to elicit a sighed turning into a moan of pleasure. 

 They both became silent with expectation. It was all in his hands. If he had been able to think straight he would have realized it didn't matter what he did for they were his for the taking. 

 He quickly pulled his cock from his trousers, unusually without a fumble, it was in his hand springing to attention. It flicked against Elizabeth's rump. He leant against her pushing it between the cheeks of her ass knowing she could feel it through the thin panties. 

 He reached over to his wife pulling the crotch of her panties to one side to explore her. He found her so wet he slid two fingers inside without resistance. Hoping it would be enough to keep her happy he pulled back from Elizabeth. His cock pulled from between her clenched cheeks to bounce against his belly. 

 He moved forward lower this time. Up a leg of the loose French knickers his cock explored pressing against her asshole. She lifted her ass and pushed back onto the tip of his cock. He needed no further guidance. He thrust forward for his cock to penetrate her in one long stroke. 

 He held still inside her while he concentrated on his wife for a moment. Finding her bud with a thumb he rubbed hard with a rhythm he knew would keep her on the edge. All restraint had evaporated leaving Elizabeth rocking her body on his cock in quiet desperation. Both women started to grunt like pigs. 

 Leaning heavily against Elizabeth's ass his cock became imbedded deeply in her while she worked away at it. Tom felt for her bud and rubbed it gently feeling his cock being rammed by her movements. 

 He concentrated on his wife with one hand knowing exactly how to keep her going. She too was rocking her body on his fingers working her self up into a state of completion. 

 He looked at both gorgeous women, ass up determined to orgasm on him. He felt strong and in charge of their bodies. The power he had over them kept him supremely confident enabling him to hold back. He wanted and needed to make the moment last. The tight grip his wife's friend had on his cock held him back too, with the feeling is was impossible to let loose inside her.  

 

 ****** Friend's Husband ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Elizabeth's inner muscles flexed followed by her hips until her whole body began to quiver. "Oh! Yes!" she yelled. The sound of triumph seemed to start Dorothy off too. She pushed back on his fingers wanting more but his fingers were enough to orgasm with short stuttering gasps. 

 Tom couldn't hold back anymore he came in a flood of built up pressure. He felt every drop spurt again and again. For a moment it seemed it might continue for ever emptying his entire body of fluid leaving him a dry husk. 

 The three bodies collapsed into a heap on the floor breathing heavily. His fingers ached, twitching with cramp. A smile of pure pleasure lit his face though he couldn't reach for the words he just mumbled incoherently. 

 Elizabeth laid out flat supine feeling full and complete. It didn't matter she had just fucked herself on her friends' husbands' cock. She had cum and her body was sending pleasurable feelings to her mind which interpreted them as caring love. 

 Dorothy breathed in long gasps of air sobering up from a heady mix of wine and arousal. She knew her husband had taken her friend and was amazed he had brought her off too. She lay on the carpet pressed against them both feeling wonderful, feeling like an earth mother bringing pleasure to everyone around her. 

 *** 

 "Sorry, Dotty." Elizabeth intoned sorrowfully. They were both more sober now though still in the afterglow of an orgasm. 

 "Don't be silly. We just got carried away. You're looking at him with a look of lust." Dorothy told her. Elizabeth quickly looked away from her friend's husband feeling guilty. "I'll get some fresh orange, we need it. For your penance you can prepare him for me, it's my turn." 

 "What?" Elizabeth croaked. 

 Dorothy made a lewd gesture with a finger between her lips. "I can't," she demurred with eyes wide in surprise. "He's your husband," she whispered. 

 "I'll be getting all the attention in the world for months after this. Get him hard for me Lizzy, I need him." She got up and walked out to the kitchen. 

 There was some logic to the instruction but she failed to grasp it. Elizabeth crawled over to where he lay. He was sprawled across the carpet half asleep with his penis flopped over a thigh. She dare not look at his face for she felt so embarrassed. She took a hold of his cock and braced herself. It was covered in their salty juices and at the best of times hadn't relished what to her was an undesirable task. Perhaps her friend sensed this for it to be a genuine penance. 

 She sucked his flaccid cock into her mouth feeling him stirring yet his cock remained asleep. She concentrated on the task desperate to get it over with. 

 He opened his eyes surprised at seeing his wife's friend sucking on the end of his cock. He had been exhausted but laid there feigning sleep to avoid the repercussions. He had fucked his wife's friend right in front of her, or rather beside her. To add to the insult he had finger fucked his wife at the same time. He marveled at the way women dealt with such issues preferring not to understand. 

 Elizabeth wondered how the hell she had got into this. She was sucking for dear life on a strangers cock trying to revive him for a friend. She let the salty mess dribble out of the side of her mouth. It wasn't so bad now she had cleaned it up. She started to think about how wonderful it had felt inside her and imagined him taking her again. She had cum so deeply it had rocked her senses. It wasn't so much him as the need for satisfaction after so long without it. Still, it was nice and a warm glow of pleasure settled upon her. 

 She settled between his legs running her lips up and down his shaft then licked it from the balls up to its head. Her lips formed a pouting O over its head and she sunk her head sucking it into her mouth. Rolling it around her mouth with her tongue she felt it responding. It bulged in her cheek confirming how hard it had grown. 

 She was beginning to feel aroused as well. The thought of having a strangers' cock in her mouth had turned from being naughty to nice. Somehow she felt proud to have brought it back to life. A foot straightened over her thigh reminding her she was lying almost naked between his legs. It was becoming exciting and if his wife didn't get back soon she might suck him dry. His cock was so large now she could only take in a part of it in her mouth. 

 A favorite bath time fantasy formed in her mind. She was a naked handmaiden at her masters feet forced to let him fuck her face. Her master was humiliating her as a punishment. A nasty thought streaked through her mind but she couldn't resist it. She dipped her head slowly and chocked. She took a deep breath trying to relax. 

 Tom watched in wonder as his cock was sucked between her lips. She seemed to struggle and for a moment thought she was going to bite it. She gagged so he lay perfectly still not wanting to choke her only just resisting the need to drive it home into her body. He watched mesmerized at the sight of his cock bulging out her cheek then it disappeared further in, almost half way. 

 Her head rose up its full length while sucking hard. He felt its head gripped tight and sucked powerfully. She took a deep breath and lowered her head further still. He felt a tightness gripping the head of his cock. Up for air again then she bobbed her head slowly drawing it in. This time he watched his cock disappear completely between those rosebud lips. Her head arose faster as though in panic. With greater determination fixed upon her face she swallowed him whole. 

 The tight constriction of her throat gripped tight. The sensation was incredible. He was being powerfully sucked by an attractive woman concentrating solely on his pleasure. Before this evening he had never met her now she was a pleasure doll on the end of his dick. Her head bobbed in a regular movement that he wished could last for ever. After having cum so much inside her pussy it was going to take some time before he spurted into that lovely mouth but the very thought of it made him quiver. 

 Dorothy walked in with a tray bringing him back into the real world. He closed his eyes hoping what you couldn't seen couldn't hurt you. 

 "Here take this." 

 He took the glass of orange juice in a trembling hand. Told to drink it he did. Surely he would wake up from this dream any moment. Having his wife squat down beside him certainly brought back his self control. It was a wonder he was still hard. They both watched her take a heaving breath then his cock disappeared down her throat with an impressive pumping action. 

 "She seems good at it," his wife said. 

 Tom kept quiet. Having his wife sitting next to him took the edge off the experience. He looked at her friend pumping away at his cock being sucked down her throat and would have cum if Dorothy hadn't been there. He closed his eyes reveling in the feeling of that tight hole encasing is rock hard cock. 

 "It's my turn now," she said casually. 

 He looked at her thinking she meant to blow him. When she walked in he had been ready to blow his load and soon would be again if this carried on. She rubbed her breasts over his face then kissed him deeply. This was too much, how could one man take this much attention and live. What a way to die though, he mused. 

 His wife pulled her friend off his cock which popped from her mouth with a seditious sucking noise. It bounced against his belly. 

 "Thank you master," she whispered. They both looked at her with puzzled looks. The misty look in her eyes cleared and her face colored crimson in embarrassment. To cover the remark she gulped down the juice. For a moment the fantasy returned feeling the cold juice run down her throat to hit her stomach as though it were her masters cum. 

 She had been completely caught up in the fantasy as a slave being disgraced before her masters' wives. As a punishment she had been humiliated before an audience by sucking his cock down her throat, forced to suck it dry. Still unable to think straight from the influence of wine, the deep orgasm and the fantasy she let her friend guide her onto hands and knees. 

 On her hands and knees Dorothy reminded her husband, "It's my turn." 

 Tom positioned himself behind her to take a hold of both breasts. She pressed back at him letting him know she was ready. She turned her head for him to nibble and ear. He leaned back then moved in pushing past the crotch of her panties sliding in up to the hilt for his balls to slap her. She wasn't as tight as her friend but this wasn't the moment to compare. 

 He reached across to delve into Elizabeth's knickers. He found her sex quickly taking a hold of it. On gripping it tight she let out a little yelp and he let go of her lips to slide a finger inside. He rubbed her clit but soon turned his attention to his wife, leaving her to maneuver around his fingers by wriggling her bottom and hips. 

 He needed to cum after the spectacular face fucking her friend had performed. His balls were tight feeling as though they were gripped in a vice. He was desperate to fill her with his sperm. He pushed deep with regular thrusts pounding at her pussy desperate to spurt his load. 

 This time he shouted. "I'm cumin, I'm cumin!" his voice harsh and rasping. 

 Both women followed with an orgasm. Both women's faces changed from the grimace of orgasm to a smile. Elizabeth was helped along by the lingering fantasy though being finger fucked by her friend's husband had something to do with it to. Dorothy had the satisfaction of feeling her husband pounding his heart out to explode inside her. She too had been driven by the evening's excitement but overriding that was the importance of winning her husband back. 

 He was back where he should be, pleasuring her. The evening had ended as it should and all would be well. A long low self satisfied breathy sigh escaped her lips. He would remember this evening but if he forgot she would remind him for she looked forward to receiving his attentive thanks for a long time to come.  

 

 ****** Friend's Husband Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© An unexpected gift for wife and friend. This is a replacement for the badly edited first submission -- my fault -- any volunteers to be an editor! 

 * 

 Dorothy gulped at a glass of orange juice. Her head was throbbing even after standing for half an hour under a steaming hot shower. In the kitchen she fumbled with coffee, managing to spill grounds on the counter but enough found its way into the machine. Leaning on the back of a chair she looked round the sparkling kitchen with too much sunlight spilling through the blinds to focus on anything. 

 Instead she closed her eyes wondering about last night which led to dreadful thoughts of what the consequences might be. It was never a good idea to have sex outside of marriage but last night it had been brought into the relationship. Could their bond of trust survive the drunken mistake? 

 Scraping a chair away from the table Dorothy dropped her weary frame down hard. Five minutes later her friend walked in wearing a borrowed dressing gown. Elizabeth didn't look as bad as she felt but then her friend could take a drink and survive. 

 "Morning Dotty," Elizabeth said quietly. Elizabeth was unsure how her friend might react this morning so took it easy. Pouring a coffee she sat down opposite her. 

 "Sorry Lizzy," Dorothy said. 

 "It's OK I don't eat breakfast," Elizabeth stated glibly. 

 "You know what I mean," Dorothy responded, sounding exasperated. 

 "I know you too well, you analyse things too much. Just forget it." The look on her friends face meant she had to convince her. "What happened was just a one off. If Tom is OK about it and I'm alright then you should relax too." 

 "Tom is pretending to sleep with a really bad fake snore. I don't know how he feels about it yet." 

 "I heard from the spare bedroom! That's what got me out of bed. I can't imagine him complaining can you?" Elizabeth reasoned. 

 "Last night I was fool enough to think it might improve our sex life. Now I'm not so sure." Dorothy tried to explain. 

 "You are probably right. Stop feeling guilty woman. We're entitled to some fun and games too you know. It's not just men that have urges," Elizabeth tried to console her. 

 "What if he wants to start swinging? I couldn't," Dorothy complained. 

 "It just happened, Dotty. It was one of those things that just, well, it happened so leave it at that. I enjoyed it. Don't you dare deny it! Tom probably thought it was all his birthdays rolled into one. I was well away last night so were you. Stop feeling guilty," Elizabeth sighed. "If you decide to give it another try I'm up for it. Joking!" Elizabeth hastily added. 

 "By the look in you're eyes I'm not so sure," Dorothy teased back. 

 "That's better. Just laugh it off. For heavens sake, don't give him a hard time over it either." Elizabeth advised. 

 "What should I say to him?" Dorothy flustered. 

 "Relax! Say nothing. You know what men are like. He won't want to talk about it. He won't know how. Look, it was great for me but that's it. Thanks for the fuck now I'm off." Elizabeth laughed. 

 Dorothy looked shocked but took the point. She giggled then broke into a full blown belly laugh. They broke off suddenly when Tom walked into the kitchen. Their heads turned toward him. 

 On hearing their laughter he thought it safe to approach what might have been an unexploded bombshell. Under their combined stares he hesitated before continuing to the fridge. They were checking him out like a couple of young women on the prowl. They looked good in the thin dressing gowns but he dare not stare. 

 "Anyone want juice?" he asked. 

 "I'd love some more of your juice Tom," Elizabeth quipped. The two women broke into giggles. 

 Tom stood by the fridge knowing they had sorted it out between them, also realizing he was going to have to stand some flak. At least they were laughing. He just hoped it would last. When Elizabeth left, Dorothy might start to blame him for what happened last night. He looked at his wife seeing how influenced she was by her friend. Perhaps if Elizabeth stayed awhile he would get away with it without receiving an earful of nagging, or worse. 

 "Elizabeth some decorum please," Dorothy said trying to sound offended and failing due to a tight lipped guffaw. 

 "De-cum, is that like decaf?" Elizabeth patted her friends back as she choked on the coffee. "Sorry, Dotty. It's naughty to flirt with your husband. Let him fuck me and suck his cock but don't flirt with him." 

 Dorothy gasped at her friend's directness. Tom just stood there waiting for his wife to explode in anger hoping he wouldn't be the target. Dorothy looked at him a moment then sipped the coffee. It sank in what her friend was doing. Elizabeth was no fool and she certainly wasn't a slut. Elizabeth was bringing it all out into the open, forcing them to face up to it. 

 "Well you looked as though you needed a good seeing to. I just happen to have a stud in the house that could handle you," Dorothy said, with a sweet innocent smile. 

 Elizabeth looked directly at Tom's crotch. "Thank you Dotty. He is and he did. A very good seeing too. You're a very lucky woman," she said, with a wistful look in her eyes. 

 "Any time Elizabeth." Dorothy said. Realizing what had been offered she wanted to bite the words back. It was hard to continue as her thoughts became troubled. 

 "Well the stud wants breakfast, how about it ladies?" Tom asked. 

 "You must be exhausted after such a performance last night. Come on let's cook the stud some breakfast." Elizabeth told her friend. Grabbing an arm she hoisted her up out of the chair to get her going before she started to sink into another funk. 

 Dorothy the faithful domesticated wife worked on automatic pilot floating around the kitchen handing Elizabeth implements and instructions. Eventually she told her friend. "You're useless. Sit down and let me do it." 

 Tom still suspected his wife might turn on him once Elizabeth left. He just didn't understand how he had got away with it or what the teasing had been all about. "So, how long you staying?" 

 "I'm driving back after breakfast. I'll probably get dressed first though." Neither of them laughed. She caught him eyeing up her cleavage and pulled the gown together. It had been too long since a man had looked at her like that over the breakfast table. It was nice but wrong. He was her friend's husband and very much, off limits. Last night would have to remain just a delightful memory. 

 "I thought you would visit friends while here. It might be a long time before you return." Tom suggested. 

 "That sounds like a great idea Lizzy. Why don't I take you round the old gang? They would love to see you after all this time." Dorothy enthused. 

 Always one to make quick decisions, Elizabeth agreed. They left the clearing-up to Tom while dressing and fussing over what to wear. 

 Eventually they left so Tom started to relax. "A whole afternoon to do whatever I want." He muttered. "I can't remember what I like to do though," he laughed. Rejecting chores, car and house fixing he looked through an old film collection. 

 He didn't want to sit at home drinking alone and meeting friends was out of the question. He might spill the sordid truth about last night after a few drinks. That would spell disaster. Dorothy would never forgive him. 

 There was nothing on the box so slipping in a DVD of a favorite movie he opened a can of beer. He sat back in the favorite chair feeling pleased that he had got away with it.

 The phone rang. He jumped up startled from a deep sleep. "Damn! I've wasted an afternoon of freedom! Hello!" he answered sounding gruff. 

 "Hi! Mister Wonderful, how about a lift home." Dorothy said sounding as though she had more than enough which was probably only three glasses of wine. Tom sighed heavily. It was only nine and they were ready for home. He knew where Jenny lived so dropped the receiver and hurried over. 

 *** 

 Helping them into the car took a great deal of patience. The women had spent all afternoon together talking yet even now they turned at the door to discuss another absent friend. They hugged again and tottered toward the car. 

 "I'll pick up Dorothy's car tomorrow if that's OK?" Tom asked Jenny, seeing it was blocking their drive. 

 "OK Tom, or should I call you Mister Wonderful," Jenny beamed with red wine staining her teeth. Before he could escape she put her arms around him for a hug. That was fairly normal as they were friends but the big sloppy kiss was unexpected. If he wasn't mistaken her lips were parted too. If he didn't have enough problems already he might have taken advantage. 

 In the car the two women dissected the gossip. Apparently there had been a few friends dropping by for a chat which was convenient. They could discuss them when they left with whoever was still there. Tom cringed at the thought of Jenny boring Bill with all that female gossip. He remembered they were separated and figured that's why she had hugged him so tight. 

 "Straight home, Mister Wonderful," Dorothy announced. 

 "What's all this Wonderful stuff?" he asked. 

 "Elizabeth has been telling them all how wonderful you are." Dorothy laughed. They both broke into titters. 

 "You didn't tell them about last night did you?" he exclaimed. 

 "No silly. Just get us home. Quick I'm bursting," Dorothy told him. 

 "I was just telling them how lucky she is to have such an attentive husband, that's all," Elizabeth joined in. They both laughed at a shared joke. 

 Tom kept looking back at them in the mirror wondering what it was all about. Just the sight of them together made him hard. 

 *** 

 Tom walked into the lounge with a large scotch to dull his embarrassment. They were relaxing on the same comfortable chairs as last night and he was stiffening up at the thought of what happened. Sitting down carefully he tried to hide the lump in his trousers. While swirling the ice he stared into the glass trying to think of something else other than having two sexy drunken women so close. 

 "No! You two have had enough," he told them. 

 "What have you go there, a stiff one?" Elizabeth said, and they both giggled. 

 "Just two fingers of pure malt," he said, trying not to rise to the bait. 

 "Oh! Nice! I could do with two fingers," Elizabeth teased. 

 Tom looked at his wife surprised she was accepting the rude comments. "You two are behaving like naughty school girls." When they made faces at him and blew raspberries he just shook his head with a rueful smile. When he came home with some guys from the pub she had said much the same thing about him and his friends. 

 It was a pain being sober with them finding everything so funny. After having sex with them the barriers were so much more relaxed. When they started discussing him as though he wasn't there it was too much. 

 "I used to be able to cook. She de-skilled me," he said defensively. 

 "Oh! You've still got some very nice skills," his wife added suggestively. 

 "Don't get out of hand women or I'll have to smack your bottoms," he warned them playfully. 

 "Ooowww! Promises, promises," they chorused. 

 "He can be so masterful Lizzy," Dorothy added. 

 "Come over here and I'll teach you to behave," he said. He didn't catch what his wife murmured to her friend while inelegantly sliding off the chair. He was too surprised that she didn't just follow up on the teasing but was staggering over to him. 

 She stood before him with a finger in her mouth telling him, "Sorry I misbehaved like a naughty girl," she giggled. 

 He couldn't think of a witty remark so pulled her over his knee. He tickled her until she squirmed helplessly out of breath pleading for him to stop. 

 "Are you going to behave now?" Tom asked, trying to sound serious. 

 "No!" she cried out between giggles. 

 He lifted the back of the dress to playfully slap the white cotton panties. She continued to say 'no' without much complaint so he bunched the panties to bare her cheeks and slapped her again. He wasn't spanking her hard but she stopped giggling. "Are you going to behave yourself now?" he asked. 

 "Yes sir," she told him. 

 "Good, otherwise I might have sent you to stand in the corner," he warned her playfully. Tom had almost forgotten Elizabeth was there while concentrating on his wife. When she rolled off onto the floor in a fit of giggles Elizabeth took her place before he had a chance to deter her. He was unsure of this. Looking at his wife pulling her dress down he waited hesitantly for a reaction. 

 "She started it. You should give the naughty bitch more than me," his wife chuckled, trying to sound like a petulant teen. 

 "Yes sir, I have been very naughty," Elizabeth murmured. 

 Watching her friend being spanked juiced her up bringing on another slave fantasy. She closed her eyes imagining being forced over a master's knee ready for punishment. The humiliation of it was fueling a heat between the legs difficult to resist. When he pulled the back of the dress up, she pulled her panties down. The unfamiliar feeling of lacy knickers sliding down the backs of her legs was so erotic it pushed her further into the fantasy. 

 It was obvious even to Tom she wanted this so he slapped a cheek to see what happened. Instead of delivering a funny line she counted out loud and thanked him. 

 "One, thank you for punishing me, Maser," Elizabeth whispered. 

 She was hardly aware of where she was. In her imagination she was a harem girl being punished by her master. 

 "Two, thank you for punishing me, Master," she continued with a line from a bath-time fantasy. 

 Reaching ten, five on each cheek, he told her that was enough. She arose to stand before him with head bowed in shame. "Thank you Master for punishing me," Elizabeth croaked. Her mouth was dry, her wet panties were on the floor and she felt humiliated from voicing a naughty fantasy before friends. 

 Tom and Dorothy looked at each other and shrugged. Dorothy watched in fascination as her friend struggled to back out of a very personal revelation. Dorothy was about to laugh it off but decided to take advantage. All through school Elizabeth had been the leader, as she had been all afternoon with friends. Seeing how vulnerable this self-important business woman had become seemed too good an opportunity to miss. 

 "Thank your master properly, slave," Dorothy told her. With hand signals and a grin aimed at her husband she meant for him to play along. 

 Tom looked at his wife with a doubtful look unsure of what she was up to. When Elizabeth had been ass upward over his lap it was obvious how excited and carried away with lust she had become. It was easy to guess something of what she was into. He sat staring at Elizabeth seeing the hesitation in her eyes. She was torn between a private need and the embarrassment of revealing it. 

 "On your knees slave and thank your master," Dorothy ordered more forcefully. It was obvious she had a master slave thing and would use this naughty little revelation to tease her whenever they met. 

 Elizabeth's heart pounded in her chest as she sank to her knees. The desperation was a torment tearing her insides out. This had been a harmless bath-time fantasy for years but it was no longer private. The humiliation was driving her on, stoking up the fires of passion. She shuffled forward on hands and knees toward him. Reaching out diffidently at first, she became subsumed in the passion of the moment, and boldly grabbed the bulge in his jeans. She almost tore it free to rub her face over his hard cock. 

 Tom just sat there mesmerized. Dorothy hadn't meant it to go this far. She too was spellbound at the sight of her friend nuzzling her husbands cock. She had expected Elizabeth to turn it into a joke. 

 Leaning forward Elizabeth hesitated dramatically above his hardness with a pair of luscious full lips forming an 'O'. "Thank you master," she said quietly. She sucked it into her mouth between wet lips, salivating over it. Lifting her head she licked its full length from balls to tip. Her hand burrowed into his jeans to fondle his balls. Lifting her head again she dropped it to suck powerfully on the head of his penis. 

 They both watched intently his cock disappearing into her mouth. Her head began to bob up and down in a steady pumping action in his lap. Dorothy was both appalled and fascinated at the same time. She slid down beside her husband onto the sofa watching her best friend sucking his cock down her throat. 

 Elizabeth was completely lost in a fantasy. She was a dutiful slave satisfying a master's command after being punished. If she was lucky and fulfilled his bestial desires he might let her cum too. 

 Tom watched his cock disappear between those rosebud lips sucking on his cock with gusto. 

 Feeling it squeezed in her throat he almost spurted down it but the close presence of his wife brought him back from the brink. A few more strokes and it would be impossible to wait for his wife's approval. Nothing in the world could hold him back. 

 This was the moment. He watched her come up for air. She sucked his cock down to the balls and he spurted down her throat. 

 She spluttered and coughed but managed to swallow most of his sperm. What was missed splattered over her face as she lifted her head. 

 Dorothy pulled the back of Elizabeth's dress up over her head leaving her naked except for a bra. She wiped her husband's sperm off Elizabeth's face with the expensive silk dress adding to the sense of vindictiveness. Dorothy was enthralled with the power held over her friend. It would only last as long as Elizabeth was in the grip of that fantasy so determined to keep her there. 

 "Now prepare your master for me, slave," she demanded. 

 Elizabeth sucked his flaccid cock into her mouth working it hard with tongue and lips stroking it with one hand while juggling his balls with the other. He hoped it might take some time to recover but the way that tongue was licking his cock with lips tightly squeezing it there was no way to resist. The erection showed in a cheek then disappeared down her throat. 

 "Leave it slave," Dorothy commanded. She was enjoying the unfamiliar sense of power. On hearing little mewling sounds Dorothy looked between her legs to find she was playing with herself. Elizabeth's face hovered over his cock with an expression of lustful need. 

 "Slave, turn around and sit on your masters cock," Dorothy said. She wasn't sure if it stemmed from guilt or some weird fascination. Dorothy maneuvered her friend over her husbands cock pushing her down onto it. She watched her husband lift his hips to reach deep into her friend. 

 He began a lusty heaving of their bodies. Elizabeth's breasts jiggled in time with every thrust and with every deep penetration she emitted little whimpering sounds of enthusiasm. 

 Again he spurted into her only this time it was aimed at her womb not her throat. Deep inside, held tight by strong muscles, an upward thrust brought on a long and hard orgasm. 

 Dorothy watched her husband cum into her friend with a look of consternation on her face. Their contorted faces and the guttural sounds were fascinating yet she thought it was wrong to be enjoying the performance. Her best friend was humping her husband! She slipped off the sofa trying to be unobtrusive which was easy to do considering the state they were in. 

 The sooner Elizabeth left the better she thought. With a sigh she realized it had been her fault to encourage them. She laid awake listening to them making out again in the lounge before falling into a fitful sleep full of bewildering dreams. 

 *** 

 As Elizabeth had advised she didn't give Tom a hard time though she was thankful he was giving her a hard time. Over the next few weeks he was so attentive she soon forgave him and herself. By the time her friend phoned she had forgiven her too. 

 With the usual banalities over Elizabeth came to the point, "I'm late." She stated flatly.  

 

 ****** Friend's Husband Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© "What for?" Dorothy asked, thinking her friend had to go. 

 "My period, I'm late." 

 "Oh, that. I'm often late and sometimes early. What have you been up to naughty girl?" Dorothy teased. Remembering the fantasy she was about to tease her when Elizabeth exploded with whoosh of words. 

 "Nothing! Not since, you know, that weekend." 

 "Well it's too early to tell and it can't be Tom, we've given up trying." Dorothy laughed nervously with a tinge of regret thrown in. 

 "Is it you or him Dotty? Sorry to ask, but I'm worried." 

 "I'm fertile but his count is low so stop worrying." Dorothy sighed on remembering the anguish when first married. They had soon got over it but being reminded wasn't easy on her. 

 "OK! I'm just anxious I guess." Elizabeth sighed. 

 They continued to catch up on gossip about friends, helping them forget about the naughty weekend reassuring each other it was alright. That evening Dorothy was more than ever in the mood for her husband's advances. 'If only,' she thought. 

 A couple of weeks later Elizabeth phoned as promised just to keep in contact. Dorothy caught on to the edge in her voice and wondered what the trouble was. 

 Eventually she blurted out, "I'm pregnant Dotty." The line was silent for a moment with just the buzz of electricity louder than their thoughts. "Did you hear what I said?" 

 "Yes!" Dorothy breathed out the word in a long sigh. "What are you going to do about it?" she asked eventually. 

 "I don't know. It's still a shock. I'm sorry Dotty. What should I do, you're the sensible one." 

 "Don't do anything rash. How do you know, have you had tests?" Dorothy asked. 

 "Yes, it's confirmed," Elizabeth sobbed. 

 "Hey! Cheer up it's marvelous, a wonderful thing." Dorothy tried to sound cheery. 

 "What about my career! I'm not marred so this will go down like a brick in the office. I'll be showing soon. What am I going to do? I feel stupid being caught at this age, I should have known better." Elizabeth wailed. 

 "We can't talk on the phone you had better come over and discuss it. Tom will have to be involved too." Dorothy insisted. A thought struggled through her mind of having a child, even Elizabeth's child to care for. It was a thrilling half formed idea. In the state Elizabeth was in she might get rid of it and their only hope of having a family. 

 Elizabeth didn't fly over as Dorothy hoped but took the advice and held fast on making plans. They talked on the phone over the weeks and eventually came to an arrangement between them. 

 *** 

 Three months had passed since the naughty weekend when Elizabeth arrived at the airport. "Hi, Tom." Elizabeth nervously greeted him with a not too obvious pregnant tummy. 

 "Hi! You look radiant," he said, while hugging her gently. 

 "Well you seem to be taking this all so very well," Elizabeth said with an accusing tone. 

 "I think it's great. I've no problem with it, so, neither should you," he chided. He ran a hand over her tummy. "How is everything?" 

 She was about to tell him to leave her body alone then realized it was his lump. The impact hit her hard. Alone at home it had been easy to forget he had something to do with it. This bump, this trouble, was partly his. 'How stupid to get into this situation,' she angrily thought, yet again. 

 "You OK?" he asked. 

 "Yea sure," she answered with sarcasm. "How's Dorothy?" 

 "She's fine, well, you'll see for yourself." 

 Elizabeth was too preoccupied to pick up on the vague reply. They drove on in silence. Elizabeth had a grim look upon her face and Tom a silly grin on his. More than once she cursed men for having such an easy life. 

 They walked into the lounge with Tom shouting a usual greeting to his wife. 

 Dorothy wiped her hands on a towel and joined them from the kitchen. "You look great," she enthused while wrapping her arms around her friend. 

 "Hey! What the hell!" Elizabeth yelped. She stood back holding onto Dorothy's arms. "No!" she gasped. 

 "Yes!" Dorothy grinned, while nodding her head up and down in silly exaggerated movements. 

 Elizabeth had felt more than her own pregnant bump pressing between them. 

 "Why didn't you tell me?" Elizabeth shot back at her friend. 

 The accusation of deceit was ignored as both Dorothy and Tom grinned at her. "I'm three months gone! Isn't it wonderful!" she declared. She was massaging her tummy with one hand and with the other held on to Tom. 

 "How in hell's name did this happen?" Elizabeth moaned. They looked so pleased with themselves she couldn't bring herself to shout at them. 

 "You know how it happened," Dorothy beamed. "You must have excited him into producing all those wonderful active sperm. Thank you Lizzy!" she beamed. 

 "What about me?" Elizabeth cried. A terrible thought dawned upon her that they wouldn't want the child now they had their own. 

 "You can stay here with us as arranged. Nothings changed. We can be one big happy family." Dorothy said. She beamed brightly looking ever more like the earth mother she had always wanted to be. 

 "and, getting bigger all the time." Tom said, still grinning inanely. 

 "I need a drink!" Elizabeth declared. 

 "No drinking, mother to be." Dorothy scolded her. 

 "I know, I know," she whispered. 

 *** 

 Next morning the two friends settled into the kitchen with Elizabeth admiring the swift movements that brought coffee and a full breakfast before her. "Maybe this might work," she conceded. 

 "I've had an appetite for other things too, how about you?" Dorothy asked. 

 "I guess we'll be sharing damn notes for the next six months. Recently, yes, I must admit." Elizabeth said, between mouthfuls of toast and beans. 

 "I've been thinking about the arrangements. The spare room has a queen sized bed so it won't be a problem. It's which nights you want, I mean, we should have set nights otherwise it might become awkward." Dorothy suggested nervously. 

 "What?" Elizabeth said, not really listening. 

 "With Tom I mean. We should decide which nights he spends with us." 

 Elizabeth choked on a piece of bacon. "Am I hearing you right? Damn! Lizzy! When did you become so liberated?" 

 "He's the father of your child. Perhaps you might want some comforting? It would be nice to have the father of your child cuddle you, or what ever, maybe. Just a suggestion," Dorothy said, tailing off into a murmur. 

 "In bed, spending the night with your husband?" Elizabeth stopped short on feeling the familiar squishy feeling between the legs. She had thought of that naughty weekend many times since and fantasized over it. Though it had turned into a nightmare on realizing she was pregnant. Recently she had to admit her body was becoming charged with sexual longings. 

 "The father of my child." Elizabeth mused. She rolled the thought around her mind liking the feeling of it. 

 "The father of our children." Dorothy corrected her. Report_Story
