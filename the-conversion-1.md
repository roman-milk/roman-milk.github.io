The Conversion
==============

John was sitting in the chair watching as I worked on Bill's cock with my mouth. He was smiling at me and slowly stroking his erection. I winked at him, took my mouth off of Bill and got on the bed. Bill spread my legs so he could slide his hard cock into my steaming pussy for the third time that afternoon and I moaned: 

 "Oh yes, oh god yes, that feels so damned good." 

 He lifted my legs up onto his shoulders so he could push deep into me and began fucking me hard and I came and I came and I came. I felt him tense up and then he erupted and splashed my insides with spurt after spurt of his cum. I was astonished that he could push so much into me after already having cum in me twice. 

 Bill pulled out and fell to the bed beside me, but I wasn't through and I wanted more. I wanted more, much, much more and I bent my head and took his limp cock in my mouth and went to work on him. He recovered faster than I thought he would and I climbed on top of him and used my hand to guide him into me. I motioned for John to come over and join us and he got on the bed and moved in behind me. I felt his fingers probe my ass and I hissed: 

 "Yes, yes, right there, put it right there." 

 It was a good thing that both John and Bill had already been in my ass once each and had loosened it up or John's quick shove might have brought me pain instead of the pleasure I received when he entered me. I had to hard cocks in me at the same time and the feeling was incredible. I had the strongest climax of my life. It was totally fantastic and I wanted it to go on and on, but I knew I couldn't. Even in the almost mindless bliss I was experiencing I still had a small portion of my brain trained on the clock. I had to finish this and get home. 

 "Fuck me, fuck me hard, fuck me hard and make me cum" I chanted as I urged the two men on and I came one more time as the two men exploded inside me. I felt John's cock pulse as his pushed his load deep into my ass and seconds later Bill flooded my pussy. I held still and luxuriated in the feeling and then I said: 

 "That's enough sweeties. I'd love to stay longer, but I need to get on home and fix my husband's dinner." 

 "You going to feed him our cream pies?" 

 "Good heavens no." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because my being that wet might make him suspicious and we don't want that, do we? We certainly don't want anything to put a stop to what we are doing, right." 

 "No, I guess not." 

 The two men dressed and left and I rushed to the bathroom to shower and douche before getting dressed and going home. 

 That's it boys and girls, one more true adventure in the life of Cyber Slut Wife. Stay tuned for the next time this bored housewife spreads her legs for some fun. 

 +++++ 

 I clicked on the 'back' button until I got to the story index, checked to see if there were any other stories I wanted to read, found none and then signed of the Net. I checked my watch and saw that I had cut it pretty close again. Vickie was due home in fifteen or twenty minutes from one of her many church activities and I always liked to give myself a half hours leeway. 

 I was going to have to get a watch with a built in alarm. The last thing I needed was for Vickie to come home and find me reading erotic stories an Internet adult web site. I had pretty much run out of patience with my wife and another argument and preaching session could very well end our marriage. 

 It was a story that a hundred thousand people could identify with. Childhood sweethearts, going steady all the way through high school; separated by college and back together four years later. Marriage, three kids, now grown and out on their own and a wife with suddenly nothing to do to keep her occupied. 

 Most wives in those circumstances went out to see if they could get back into the work force or join a charitable organization and donate time. That might have been the route that Vickie would have taken if circumstances had been different. 

 I still don't know how it happened, but I went away for a two week training session and when I got home I found that in my absence Vickie had been SAVED! Washed in the blood of The Lamb, had accepted Jesus as her Lord and Master and I'm here to tell you that there is no greater fanatic in the world than the recently converted. 

 I pulled into the garage, got my suitcases out of the trunk and noticed a box with my Penthouse, Playboy, Gallery and other men's magazines sitting next to the trashcans. Something else didn't look right in the garage and it took me a minute before I realized that all my girlie calendars were missing from the walls. 

 I walked into the house and found Vickie sitting at the kitchen table reading a Bible. The girlie posters and magazines slipped to the back of my mind as I went over and kissed her. Instead of getting up so we could hug and kiss each other she turned her head so that my kiss just brushed her cheek. Not the greeting I had expected from a loving wife after a two week separation. 

 "Come on sweetie," I said, "Lets go upstairs, I'll unpack and we can make up for some lost time." 

 "No Burt. I think you had better sit down. We need to talk." 

 "About what?" 

 "About God Burt, and how we have not let Him into our lives. When was the last time you went to church Burt?" 

 "I don't know. When I was twelve or thirteen I'd guess." 

 "Why did you turn your back on God then?" 

 "Probably because I came to realize that God was just a figment of imagination for people. That he didn't exist or if he did he wasn't worth paying attention to." 

 "My God Burt, how can you say that?" 

 "Easy Vickie, all I have to do is look around and see how screwed up the world is. If God so loved us that He gave us his only begotten son he wold not have let this world get into the horrible shape it is in." 

 "That is not God's fault Burt, that is the fau...." 

 "Park it Vickie. I don't argue religion with anyone. If they believe in God nothing I say is going to change their mind and there isn't anything they can say to me that is going to change mine. What the hell is this all about Vick?" 

 It turns out that while I was gone some bible thumpers came through the neighborhood knocking on doors and Vickie, tired of sitting home alone watching television, invited them in. 

 "I've asked God to forgive me for walking away from him all those years ago. I've joined a church Burt and I've decided that I'm going to devote my free time working for the church and helping to spread the Gospel." 

 She picked up a piece of paper from the table and handed it to me. 

 "Here is our schedule honey. We have Bible study on Tuesday and Thursday. There are other church activities scheduled for other nights of the week, but we will ease into them later. There are two services on Sunday, one at nine and one at eleven. I prefer the early service, but in truth it wouldn't hurt us to go to both. Of course you will need to give up your Sunday golfing. 

 "There have to be some other changes made around here and I've already started. I've gotten rid of your filthy magazines and I've pulled that trash off the walls of the garage. Oh, and all of those filthy videos have been tossed out. We also need to decide how much we are going to tithe the church. The accepted standard is ten percent, but with the children gone I think we can do better than that." 

 She looked at me expectantly and I took a deep breath and wondered where to start when suddenly it occurred to me that anything I said was going to lead to an argument that could not have any winner. I did the only thing I could think of that would make my position clear without words. I got up, went out into the garage, picked up the box of magazines and carried them back into the house. I took them into the den where I had set up a home office and I set the box down on my desk. Then I went back into the kitchen, got my suitcase and headed for the bedroom. I was unpacking my bags when Vickie came into the bedroom. 

 "Why did you do that?" 

 "Why did I do what?" 

 "Bring those filthy books back into this house." 

 "You forgot something Vickie. Those are my magazines, not yours, and you don't throw away my stuff without talking to me first." 

 "I won't have that garbage in my house Burt." 

 "It is my house too Vick and I will have what I want in it. And we might as well get this over with now. I wasn't going to say anything and just hope that it would go away, but that is unrealistic of me because it isn't going to go away. First off, I am an agnostic. I question the existence of God, but even if there is a supreme being I have no use for him, her or it. 

 "Secondly, I am not working my butt off to make money to give to a bunch of religious zealots. If you want to tithe it will be out of your household allowance. You can give up your beauty shop appointments for God. 

 "Lastly, I will not be going to Bible study, nor will I be attending any church services. All I am willing to do is go with you to church social events like potluck suppers or picnics. If you want to be a religious nut go ahead, but leave me out of it." 

 She looked at me for a moment and then she went over to the bed and took the pillow from the side she slept on and started out of the room. She stopped at the door and turned to me and said: 

 "I'll be sleeping in Krisha's old room until you come to your senses" and then she left. 

 That move ended our marriage. It continued on, but all it was after her changing bedrooms was two people co-existing in the same house. 

 +++++ 

 For the next six months all we were was civil to each other. Vickie slept in Krisha's room and I slept in what used to be ours. It wasn't easy on me, but it wasn't a major hardship either. Like a lot of couples who had been together over twenty-five years we grew less passionate, but more comfortable with each other. The sex had been good, but infrequent, maybe five or six times a month, so I did miss it, but I wasn't going to die because it stopped. 

 What I did miss was the snuggling, the cuddling and the waking up in each other's arms. I hated that Vickie was depriving me of it, but at the same time I was questioning whether she had ever really loved me if she had could she do this to me, to us. We grew farther and farther apart. 

 Vickie continued her assault on my wicked ways. The box of magazines disappeared again, but I said nothing. All they were was symbolic and the only reason I had carried them back into the house was to make a point that obviously hadn't been taken. I'd already read them and just hadn't gotten around to throwing them out. 

 It was about six weeks before I noticed that I hadn't received my subscriptions to Playboy and Penthouse Letters. I found out that Vickie was throwing them away when she picked up the mail every day. I let it slide because it didn't really matter all that much to me any more - I had found the Net! More specifically I had found the thousands of porn sites that offered me everything that I had gotten from my magazines and much, much more. 

 It didn't take me long to realize that just as my magazines had disappeared so would my computer if Vickie found out what I was using it for. I would just buy another one and another after that if I had to, but it could get expense after a while. The only other option was to end the farce that our marriage had become, but to me that was the least attractive way to go. It would mean giving up my settled existence. The house would have to be sold and the proceeds split. Everything else, savings, certificates of deposit, my pension and 401k would be split fifty-fifty and I would probably end up paying alimony. It would mean giving up my wood working shop in the basement; the three car garage which would leave me without a place to work on the '34 Ford three window coupe I was restoring. Loss of the house would inconvenience me in a lot of other ways also, so to me the solution was to just stay out of Vickie's way and not give her anything to bitch about. 

 +++++ 

 As far as the Net was concerned, my thing was erotic stories and I quickly found several sites that were free. Some were so-so, some were good and a few were excellent. I was soon spending all my time on three sites and before long I had a list of favorite authors and one of my favorites was Cyber Slut Wife. Her stories were a series (if she could be believed) of the sexual encounters she'd had. 

 Her first story described her fucking her husband's best man just before the wedding ceremony. Next were three men she slipped away with while on her honeymoon and then followed years of hanging horns on her husband with almost every friend he had, and a whole host of others. She seduced her paperboy, the home handy man who did some work in her basement, the cable guy, door to door salesmen and even a Jehovah's Witness. Each occasion fired her up for the next and she merrily went about screwing everything in pants until the day she thought she'd been caught. She worked her way through it unscathed and then backed off to let things settle down. Outside of an occasional back seat visit at a party or a bar pick up when hubby was out of town she kept her legs closed until her kids were grown and had moved out. 

 With the house empty now she had time to get back to what she liked to do most - fuck! She dressed herself up and went out to the hotel at the airport and let herself get picked up by a traveling businessman. She spent four hours in a hotel room with him and then went home and cooked her husband his dinner. Her next story told how she had done the same thing once a week for the next three weeks. The third week she was in the man's room in mid-fuck when another man came into the room and decided to join them. It was her first threesome and she had loved it. 

 The second man told her he would be back through town the following week and he asked if he could see her again. Her next story covered that visit. She met him at nine in the morning and by noon she knew just how big a slut she was. He brought in a friend and then a second one and she had her first triple penetration. 

 One of the men brought in was a local man named Harry and as the four of them were dressing the local guy had suggested that they could help each other. He had customers and clients that she could take care of which would eliminate her having to troll for fresh meat and she would be able to stop going to places where someone who knew her might see her. He would get her a cell phone that only he would have the number to; he would give her a clothing allowance so she could keep herself in sexy things and 'come fuck me' high heels and the biggie - he would rent her an apartment where she could 'entertain'. She thought it over and said yes. 

 Her latest story was about a six-man gangbang that took place when Harry hosted a poker game at the apartment. When it was over one of the men had asked her if her husband was going to notice how loose and sloppy she was and she had replied: 

 "He hasn't had me in almost a year so he'll never know." 

 "He hasn't fucked you in over a year? What is wrong with him?" 

 "Just stupid I guess." 

 I don't know why I was so into the Cyber Slut Wife stories. She was not the kind of women that I would like if I met her in person. The casual way she cheated on her husband and the callous way she always referred to him painted the portrait of a woman who was trash to my way of thinking. I think the reason I liked her stories was because they were just that, stories. She built a story around each meeting she had and included all kinds of details. None of that "I sucked his cock and then I fucked him and went home" kind of stuff. 

 +++++ 

 It had been fourteen months since Vickie had moved out of our bedroom and neither one of us had made a move toward reconciliation. Things might have gone on that way for another fourteen months had Vickie not had an accident. I was at work when the call from my daughter came. She had stopped by the house to visit Vickie and had found her unconscious at the foot of the steps. Vickie had apparently fallen down the stairs and smacked her head a good one. 

 Krisha had called 911 and Vickie was on her way to the emergency room at County General. By the time I got there she had been looked at and admitted. I talked with the doctor who told me that she had a concussion. X-rays had shown there was no bone damage: 

 "But we want to keep her overnight and take a fresh look in the morning." 

 "Thank you doctor. I'll go see her now." 

 "She's asleep right now. She was causing some problems and we had to sedate her." 

 "What kind of problems?" 

 "She was fighting the nurses and orderlies and trying to get away from them. She kept yelling that she had to get home before her husband." 

 "Odd. That doesn't sound like Vickie. Normally she couldn't care less if she was home when I got there or not. That bump on her head must have made her delirious." 

 "That's kind of what we thought too and that's why we sedated her and want to keep her here for observation." 

 I did look in on Vickie, but she was definitely out of it so I went on home. 

 +++++ 

 The first thing that I noticed were the blood spots on the carpets at the foot of the stairs and I made a mental note to get a carpet cleaner in to clean it up. The second thing didn't register right away. I didn't notice it until I was ready to sit down and eat what I had fixed myself for dinner. There was a lap top sitting on the dinning room table. I didn't even know that Vickie had one. It was open and plugged in and curiosity got the best of me. 

 The screen saver was running and I hit ENTER and the last thing Vickie was working on appeared on the screen. I suddenly knew what was behind Vickie's panic attack at the hospital and the reason why she needed to beat me home. There on the screen was a picture of a naked Vickie with a black cock sticking in her cunt. The picture didn't show her face, but I didn't need a face to know it was her. Plainly visible were the two tattoos that she had gotten on her thirty-fifth birthday; a heart with my initials in it just above the hair line of her cunt and a butterfly on the upper curvature of her right breast. 

 I sat down and started looking through the contents. Luckily nothing was password protected and what I found turned my world on end. The first thing I found was that the picture was an attachment for an email that Vickie had sent or was about to send before her accident stopped her. The email itself said: 

 "That's for your support sweetie. Here is a little something to remind you to keep sending me good comments. Love ya, CSW." 

 I wondered what CSW meant. I was familiar with LOL and some others, but I had never seen CSW before. Next I checked Sent Messages and found forty-six more emails that all said thanks for your support and all had attachments. 

 My Pictures was next and it was a revelation. There were over a hundred pictures of a naked Vickie and in all of them she had a cock either in her mouth, her ass or her cunt and in several she had more than one in her. The ones that showed a cock in her mouth had her face blurred, but I could still tell it was her by the tattoos. A close examination of the pictures showed that there were at least fourteen different men enjoying themselves at my expense. 

 A trip to My Videos let me see Vickie being an absolute slut as in thirty-one videos clips she was fucked in all three holes and in a couple of clips she was taken in all three at once. 

 The mother lode was in My Documents and it was there that I learned the meaning of CSW. There, on the hard drive, was every story that Cyber Slut Wife had written, including a few that I had not yet read. My own wife was one of my favorite authors and the stories she wrote were of the things she had been doing behind my back. I'd even gotten myself off to a couple of them and wasn't that a kick in the teeth.  

 

 

===

But even that wasn't the best part. The best part was a folder labeled "My Diary." It was an itemized account of every sexual affair that Vickie had engaged in. It gave names, dates, times and places and included a critique of the session. It started two days before our wedding and ran until the day before the accident. Her first was my cousin Tom on the night of our rehearsal dinner, her second was my best man the morning of the wedding and according to her diary there were seven other men who enjoyed her on our honeymoon when she wasn't being enjoyed by me. According to the story she wrote about it there were only three and I wondered about that. I guess she must have thought seven would be a little unbelievable for a new bride on her honeymoon. 

 I found out that she considered my best friend a 'lousy fuck' and my brother 'adequate." I was totally surprised to see that she considered me 'exceptional." If that was the case why was I only one of hundreds who had used her and why hadn't we been having more sex the last couple of years? 

 I found out that my daughter Krisha had been fathered by my about to become ex- best friend and that I might, only might, be the father of Darlene and William. 

 It was too much too fast. There was still a ton of stuff to read, but I couldn't take the time to do it. I needed to get back to the hospital and be there when Vickie woke up. Fortunately Vickie's laptop had a CD burner and I got some blanks and downloaded everything. Leaving the laptop where it was I headed back to County General. 

 +++++ 

 I was sitting in the room reading a book when Vickie woke up. She was a little groggy at first and when she finally got around to noticing me her face registered alarm. 

 "How long have you been here?" 

 "Since it happened. Krisha found you, called me and I came straight from work." 

 "You haven't been home yet?" 

 "No, not yet." 

 I saw the relief wash over her face. Just then Krisha came in and I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back Krisha was gone and I asked where she was Vickie told me that she had just stopped by to check on things and her boyfriend had been downstairs waiting so she left. I stayed for another fifteen minutes and then said I needed to get on home and feed the cat, but Vickie stopped me and gave me a list of people to call to let them know what happened. I said I would and started to leave again and again she stopped me and asked me to talk to the doctor before I left. It was obvious that she was trying to keep me from going home. It was another hour before I was able to get out of the hospital and when I got home I was not surprised to see that the laptop was gone. 

 The doctor told me that they would be releasing Vickie around two that afternoon so that gave me three hours to be nosey. I searched her car and found an overnight bag with two pair of high heels, some nylons, a garter belt and a lot of make up. I really didn't expect to find much because if her stories were true, and I didn't doubt them for one minute, most of the incriminating stuff would be at the apartment Harry had rented for her. In the closet in her bedroom I found the carrying case for the laptop, two boxes of blank CDs and some manuals. I didn't disturb them; there was no way I wanted Vickie to know that I was on to her. 

 I headed for my computer to spend some time on the stuff I had downloaded. The one thing that had bothered me most since finding her laptop and seeing what was on it was trying to reconcile Vickie's religious conversion with her whorishness. I found the answer in the information I had downloaded. In her diary she described how Harry had told her not to have sex with me any more. He told her that she belonged to him now and not me. 

 Vickie's religious conversion was a fake! It was a wedge she could use to split us apart and keep us apart. It was the age old use of sex as a weapon. Withhold it until you get what you want and then give it as a reward. In my case Vickie knew I'd never give in on the subject of religion. All her bible study classes and other church activities were just her way of getting out of the house so she could spread her legs for whoever Harry pointed her to. 

 +++++ 

 That afternoon I picked Vickie up at the hospital and brought her home. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary and as far as Vickie could tell I wasn't the least bit suspicious of anything. I spent two days going over everything I had downloaded from her laptop and thinking about what to do. I finally made an appointment with a lawyer and he gave me the bad news. In our state any divorce was going to cause a 50/50 split of the assets regardless of the reason for the divorce and I, in all likelyhood, would have to pay for both lawyers, Vickie's and mine. The only way I could get out and keep what I wanted was to find a way to make Vickie walk away without a fight. What I had to do was sue for divorce, ask for what I wanted and not have her contest it. 

 I spent another week thinking on it and I came up with a plan. It left a sour taste in my mouth to have to do it the way I was going to have to, but it was the only way for me to come out ahead on the deal. I hired a private investigator, told him what I wanted and three weeks later I had most of what I needed. I had all the information on Harry, I had the address of the apartment and I had the personal information on twenty-seven of Harry's clients who had visited the apartment. One of the most interesting of those names was Thomas Shift, our city manager. 

 The next step was to find a twenty-four hour locksmith and one night after Vickie had fallen asleep I took her keys from her purse and went to the locksmith and had them duplicated. I already knew from the detective's report that the apartment wasn't used when Vickie wasn't there so I took the duplicate keys and paid the apartment a visit. 

 The apartment closets held enough sexy lingerie to fill a Victoria's Secret store and enough pairs of high heels to outfit a Vegas chorus line. One of the bedrooms was locked and I found the key that opened it and I let myself in. There was a see through mirror mounted on one wall that allowed you to watch what was going on in the next bedroom. There were also three video cameras set up to tape the action. In the bedroom closet I found over a hundred videotapes. I'd seen enough to give me an idea on how to go about getting Vickie to fade away quietly. 

 +++++ 

 That Friday evening when I got home from work I walked into the house to shouts of, "Surprise, surprise." Vickie had thrown a surprise birthday party for me and it was most interesting to me to see the assembled guests. Besides our three kids there were fourteen couples and three guys without dates. Seventeen men and every fucking one of them was an entry in Vickie's diary. There was a lot of glad handing, back slapping good cheer and at any other time with me not knowing what I knew it would have been a hell of a fine party. 

 Brian, my soon to be ex-best friend, gave me a three day all expenses paid trip to a golf course up in Breckenridge, probably to get me out of town so he could fuck Vickie. There were other assorted gifts, but the one that caught my attention was the one from Vickie. It was a new laptop computer. There were two reasons why it grabbed my attention: I'd never shown any interest in having a laptop and I had no use for it and secondly, we were barely talking to each other so why was she spending that kind of money on me? Come to think of it, why did she even throw a party for me? It made no sense at all, but then what had recently? As I sat there and surveyed all the people laughing and having a good time I wondered how many would still be laughing after I lowered the boom. 

 +++++ 

 It took three weeks to get all the paperwork done and then I was ready. It was all a matter of timing. Tuesday night I used my duplicate set of keys to enter Vickie's love pad and I removed all the videotapes, the video cameras and anything else I thought I might like. That night at home I snuck into Vickie's bedroom and got her laptop from where she stored it in the closet and put it in the trunk of my car with everything I'd taken from her apartment. 

 Eight o'clock the next morning I was in Harry's office and I asked his secretary to tell him that Vickie Boland's husband was there to see him on a matter of great importance. She did and he stalled me long enough to try and call Vickie and find out what was going on. He didn't reach her because when I left the house I cut the phone line and I had taken her cell from her purse. Finally I felt that I had waited long enough and I told his secretary to tell him he had two minutes and then I would be leaving and my next visit would be to Thomas Shift. 

 That got him off the dime and I was ushered into his office. "What is this all about Mr. Boland?" 

 "Saving your miserable fucking ass Mr. Grant." 

 "Just what are you getting at" he snarled at me and started to get up. 

 "You get out of that chair fuckface and I'll the beat the fuck out of you and throw you out your office window and laugh as you make the four story trip down to the street." 

 He sat back down and I went on, "What it is shit head is that in order to get what I want you are going to get a free ride." I looked at my watch and said, "I'm expecting a call within the next five minutes telling me that my whorish wife has been served divorce papers. You will then see to it that she does not contest the divorce. In return none of the videotapes that used to be in your little love nest will become public and embarrass your clients. I'm sure that Tom Shift, for one, will appreciate your seeing to it that the tapes never see the light of day. But then he doesn't know about them does he? At least he doesn't know about them yet. 

 "In addition to the tapes not becoming public" and I handed him a folder, "Vickie's diary will not see the light of day. If you are unable to convince her to walk away from me without a fight it will all go public and your business goes into the shitter to say nothing of all the personal lawsuits that will be filed against you. Including one by me for alienation of affection and whatever else my lawyer can come up with." 

 Just then my cell phone beeped and I took the call. When I disconnected I said: 

 "The papers have been served. You probably won't hear from her until she can get to a phone - I disconnected the one at the house and I have her cell in my briefcase - but as soon as she does reach you it would be in your best interests to start on getting her not to contest the divorce." 

 "Just how in the hell am I supposed to be able to talk her into not contesting?" 

 "Your problem, not mine. You told her to stop having sex with me anymore and she did what you told her. You had better hope she listens to you this time too. If worst comes to worst I don't care if you have to kill her to save yourself, just let me know ahead of time so I can have an iron clad alibi." 

 I got up to leave and when I got to the door I stopped, turned and said: 

 "I owe you a lot of pain and I am torn between hurting you bad or letting you walk in order to get what I want. You need to keep that in mind when you are trying to get her to not contest the divorce. Fail and my fall back position is to ruin you professionally, personally, financially and physically. Imagine yourself in a wheelchair for the rest of your life and it just might help give you incentive." 

 +++++ 

 I was no sooner in the car when my cell went off again. The screen showed it was a number not known to me and so I figured that Vickie had gotten to a phone so I didn't take the call. She called several times over the next two hours and I finally shut off the phone. 

 At one I showed up at the house with a rented U-Haul van. Vickie was on me as soon as I was in the door waving the papers at me and demanding to know what I thought I was doing. 

 "I decided that it was time to end this farce of a marriage. When you moved out of our bedroom you showed me you didn't want me. I finally decided that I don't want you so I'm getting a divorce." 

 "Bullshit. All you ever had to do to get me out of Krisha's room and back into ours was meet me half way on our getting back in touch with God." 

 "You knew that would never happen Vickie, in fact you were counting on it." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "Doesn't matter Vick. You want to help me move your clothes and stuff out to the van, or are you comfortable with the idea I can do it without trashing most of it." 

 "Move my stuff to the van? Why?" 

 "I'm throwing you and your Bible out Vick." 

 "You can't do that. I've as much right to stay in this house as you have." 

 "That may be Vick, but you will have to get a lawyer and have him get in touch with my lawyer to establish that. Until that happens you are out. Now, you want your stuff with you when you leave or do you want me to just push you out the door?" 

 "You can't do this to me." 

 "Oh yes I can. Now start grabbing your stuff or I'm throwing you out without it." 

 "Where am I supposed to go?" 

 "I'll drive you over to your fuck pad on Newark Circle. When you get there you can call Harry and cry on his shoulder." 

 At the mention of the apartment on Newark Circle and the mention of Harry's name the fight went out of her. She went upstairs and started carrying things down and out to the van. I helped her and we were about halfway done when I saw her looking anxious. She kept digging in the closet and I finally said: 

 "It isn't there. My lawyer has it. You will get it back when the divorce is final. He is going to use what is on it for evidence. When you get to your love nest on Newark you can call Harry and he'll tell you all about it." 

 No more words were said as we finished loading her stuff into the van and nothing was said as I drove her to the apartment. I emptied the van onto the sidewalk in front of the apartment building and drove away leaving her standing there.

 The hardest part for me was telling the kids. Vickie was lying trash so I couldn't just let her tell them her version which would no doubt paint me as Attila The Hun. I had no intention playing the "pit mommy against daddy" game, but I was going to give them all the information that I had and then let them make up their own minds. 

 I called Krisha at work and asked her to meet me for a drink when she got off. I told her that I was divorcing her mother, but I didn't tell her why. I gave her a copy of everything I had taken from Vickie's computer; pictures, video clips, diary - all of it - and told her to go through it and that if she had any questions to give me a call or come by the house and see me. 

 "I'll be home all weekend 'pumpkin' (my pet name for her) if you want to talk." 

 Next I called Darlene and William and made arrangements to meet them for breakfast at a Denny's. I gave them the same talk that I gave Krisha, gave them copies of the same stuff, and went on home. 

 Darlene was the first to call. She called around noon, "Surely you don't believe any of that stuff, do you dad?" 

 "I'm afraid I believe all of it honey." 

 "It can't be true dad. There must be a reasonable explanation for it. Maybe it was an outline for a book or something. She always said she was going to write someday." 

 "Have you gone through all the material yet?" 

 "No, not yet." 

 "You remember the night your mother took you and Krisha into our bedroom and showed you her new tattoos?" 

 "Yes, I remember that Krisha and I thought it was a real kick." 

 "Finish all the material honey. Check out My Pictures and My Videos. You will recognize the tattoos." 

 "You are wrong about this dad, I just know you have to wrong. Mom couldn't do this, she just couldn't." 

 "I'm sorry honey, but I have to go now. I'll be home all day if you want to talk when you finish the material." 

 +++++ 

 I was sitting on the couch in the living room reading when Krisha came into the house. She came into the room and sat down on a chair opposite me. I put the book down and waited. She looked down at the floor for a moment and then asked: 

 "Is it true?" 

 "Is what true honey?" 

 "That Brian is my father?" 

 "I only know what your mother wrote in her diary." 

 "How long have you known?" 

 "Since the day she fell down the steps" and I went on to explain how I'd come into the house and found the laptop and what I'd done after. 

 "That computer? I guess it was a good thing I didn't take the time to look at what was on it. God only knows what I would have done." 

 "I don't understand?" 

 "That day in the hospital. When you left the room mom asked me to do her a favor. She said she had gotten you a laptop for your birthday and had set it up to check it out before giving it to you. She wanted me to run back to the house and get it before you got home and saw it. She said she would keep you busy to give me time. I didn't take the time to look at it because I thought you might be right behind me. I put it in the trunk of my car until mom called and asked me to bring it to her." 

 "I guess that explains the one I got for my birthday. After her story to you she had to give me one or you might have wondered and maybe asked about it or maybe you might have thought she had given it to me early and asked me how I liked it." 

 "I can't believe she was that way, and for all those years. You never suspected?" 

 "No, I didn't have a clue." 

 There were several moments of silence between us and then Krisha said: 

 "Brian is not my dad you know, you are. You always have been and you always will be." 

 Another period of silence and then the tears started flowing and she cried out "Daddy" and got up and came over and threw herself in my arms. She sobbed into my shoulder for a long time and between sobs she kept repeating over and over: 

 "How could she do that to you, to us." 

 +++++ 

 William was the pragmatic one. He called around five that afternoon. 

 "I've got a nine o'clock tee time in the morning. Fell like having your butt whipped?" 

 "Yeah, I can make it, but your game better be good because my putting has been killer lately." 

 "I'll pick you up at eight." 

 The first couple of minutes of the drive were filled with an awkward silence and then William said: 

 "How do we handle this?" 

 "How do we handle what?" 

 "She's my mother and I love her. You are my father and I love you. I'm not happy with what she has done to the family, but I am not going to turn my back on her. I will try and be there for her if she needs me. The same goes for you. Is my relationship with her going to be a problem as far as you are concerned?" 

 "Of course not. Just because I have no use for her doesn't mean everyone else has to feel the same way." 

 "Good." 

 We played eighteen and he did indeed whip my ass. The diary entry that he might or might not be my son was never mentioned by either of us. 

 +++++ 

 Darlene was the disappointment. She held it against me that I had exposed her mother's flaws to her and I ended up being the bad guy as far as she was concerned. I don't know if that rift will ever heal.

 Two weeks went by with no word from Harry or Vickie as to whether or not she was going to contest the divorce so I started preparing for the worst. In keeping with my promise to ruin Harry if he didn't convince Vickie to walk away I started to watch the videotapes to see just what I had to work with. I was amazed at what I found. Besides the city manager I found two councilmen and one county commissioner - all married - and several prominent local businessmen, also all married. 

 There was tape on eleven of the seventeen assholes that were at my party and another eleven that I knew fairly well. The rest of the men on the tapes I didn't recognize, but it didn't matter, I had more than enough for what I was going to do.  

 

 

===

It suddenly occurred to me that I would have no leverage if Harry somehow got the tapes back. I did have a copy of Vickie's diary but it could always be claimed that I made it up myself. I needed the visual proof so I got all of the tapes together and got them out of the house and hid them. Before I did that I copied the portions of the tapes that showed the twenty-two supposed friends of mine and I began making up packages to give to their wives and girlfriends. The package included the video of the asshole and Vickie's diary entries that pertained to him. 

 Once the packages were ready I called Harry and his secretary wouldn't put me through to him so I asked her to give him a message. 

 "Tell him that since I haven't heard from him I'm going to start putting out some of the information I have. I'm going to do my so-called friends first and that if I have not heard from him by Friday I will be calling on the wives of Thomas Minor, Gregg Silverman and Craig Staub. Those visits will be followed by visits to the wives of four politicians. He will know the ones I'm talking about." 

 By Thursday I had hand delivered the twenty-two packages to the wives and girlfriends of the twenty-two assholes. Also by Thursday I had received seven phone calls from ex-friends who swore they were going to get me for ruining their marriages. My response to all of them was the same: 

 "Hey fuckhead, you fucked my wife, I didn't fuck yours. You ruined your own fucking marriage, not me, and if you come for me bring lots of help because I have a lot of anger I need to take out on someone and you'll fill the bill just fine." 

 Never the less I started carrying a handgun under the front seat of my car. 

 Friday morning I was busy building the packages for the wives and girlfriends of the eight ex-friends I didn't have video on. I'd printed out the diary entries that pertained to them and I made eight tapes that showed Vickie with mutual friends. The idea was that I could say: 

 "Here is her dairy information on him. I don't have actual tape of him with Vickie, but here is a tape showing you what she was doing with the others. If you want to give him a pass that is your business, but at least I gave you warning that you should get yourself tested for STDs as soon as possible." 

 I had just finished the packages when the phone rang. It was Harry. 

 "She had agreed. What now?" 

 "Have her go see my lawyer. I'll give her until Tuesday. After that I won't hold back." 

 "You know what you've done to her? She's afraid to go out any more. There are a dozen people looking for her with mayhem on their minds." 

 "Not my problem. It wouldn't bother me any if some of them got a hold of her." 

 "You really hate her that much?" 

 "No, actually I don't hate her that much. I hate her a hell of a lot more." 

 "What happens after she sees the lawyer?" 

 "I'll give her back her computer, but I will sit on everything else until the divorce is final. If the divorce goes off with out a hitch I'll return everything I took out of the apartment." 

 "After making copies?" 

 "For my protection against reprisals I will copy the tapes of the four politicians and two of the most prominent businessmen." 

 "That isn't very trusting of you." 

 "I trusted my wife and look what that got me." 

 +++++ 

 I spent the rest of Friday handing out the last eight packages and Saturday I had the kids over for a barbecue. In the middle of it Darlene pulled me aside and tried to talk me into letting her mother move back in the house and when I said no way she left in a huff. The other two watched her go and just shrugged their shoulders. 

 My standing golf date for Sunday was cancelled since two of the foursome were ex-friend whose wives received a package from me. Sometimes it just sucks to be me. 

 Monday at two in the afternoon my lawyer called me and told me that Vickie had just been in and had signed the papers. Now it is just sit and wait for the divorce to become final. 

 I know it sounds silly to say this, but I do believe I was better off not knowing what I know now. 

 And I'm probably never going to read a Cyber Slut Wife story ever again. Report_Story
