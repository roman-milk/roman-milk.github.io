 ****** Becoming A Slut Husband: Tony ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I should have been pissed but I wasn't. I should have wanted to kill the bastard, but I didn't. I should have wanted to do a lot of things, but I found out that I just didn't care enough so I let things be. Well, that wasn't completely true. There was still a small kernel of need to get some sort of revenge and I knew I would eventually. 

 +++++++ 

 Marie and I had grown up together. I was seven and she was six when her family moved into the house next door to us. There were four kids in the family and she was the only one I got along with. Her brother Alphonse was three years older than I was and he was a bully. He soon learned that he would be well advised to leave me the fuck alone. He was bigger and stronger than I was and he could whip my ass, but there wasn't any 'quit' in me and if he started something it didn't end until some grown ups pulled us apart. 

 I had my dad to thank for that. I'd gotten beat up once when I was in the first grade and I had run home crying. After I'd told him what had happened he asked me what I had done to the other kid. 

 "Nuthin" I had sniffled and he had gotten mad as hell. 

 "You don't run away Tony, you never ever run away. You fight back until you are too tired to get your arms up and then you use your feet or your teeth to tear the other guy's throat out, but you don't quit. They will all soon learn that about you and they will leave you alone. If you cut and run they will never stop picking on you." 

 It took three fights before Alphonse got the message, but he did get it. 

 Marie had two sisters, Veronica was four years older and Rosario was three years younger. Veronica, being three years older than me had no use for me and Rosario being four years younger was just a baby as far as I was concerned. There were no other kids in the neighborhood our age so Marie and I gravitated toward each other and by sixth grade we were a pair. 

 We grew together, we played together and we stayed together. It remained that way all the way through middle school and then high school. We were inseparable, joined at the hip, yin and yang. There was no other boy for her and no other girl for me. I had never asked her for a date, we never discussed going steady and I never asked her to marry me. Didn't need to do any of those things because we just 'were'. It was that simple - we just 'were'. All I did was ask the question: 

 "When do you want to get married?" and she said, "Not until I finish college" and that was it. Three months after graduation we were married. 

 +++++++ 

 The next twenty-four years were your basic middle class marriage. We both started out working and saving our money for a down payment on a house, bought one and after our second child Marie decided that she wanted to be a stay at home mom. She raised our three kids as I worked hard to provide for the family and when they were all off to school Marie went back to work. 

 One by one the kids left for college and Marie and I were alone again, but something had changed somewhere along the way. I don't even when it happened or what had happened, but the connection was gone. We lived together, the affection was there, but there wasn't any passion anymore. We kissed each other goodbye as we left for work in the morning. We sat at the table and discussed each other's day over dinner, we watched TV or read in the evenings and then went to bed. The urgency for lovemaking wasn't there anymore. Marie just didn't seem to want it and I didn't push it. It got to where we made love maybe two or three times a month, but nothing fiery. It was almost like each of us was doing a duty, fulfilling a requirement. It wasn't until much later that I finally figured out the disconnect between us, but by then it was too late, way too late to repair the damage. 

 +++++++ 

 We both had jobs that sometimes required us to work late and it was one of those late nights that caused everything to come crashing down. It was one of those rare nights when both of us had to work late. I finished two hours sooner than expected and on a whim I drove over to where Marie worked to see if she might get done early too and maybe we could hit a restaurant for dinner. 

 The place was locked up tight, no lights were on and the parking lot was deserted. Marie had obviously finished up earlier than she had expected also. I drove on home and was surprised to see that Marie wasn't there. Since her office was closed when I got there she'd had more than enough time to beat me home. I checked the telephone answering machine, but there were no messages. Maybe she had stopped for a drink with the girls she worked with. She didn't usually do things like that, but there is always a first time. I fixed myself some leftovers for dinner, checked the TV Guide and saw that there was nothing on worth watching (was there ever?) and so I picked up a book and settled down on the couch to read. 

 I was engrossed in the book and had lost track of time and it wasn't until I heard the garage door opener start to run that I put the book down and looked at the time. It was ten-thirty. Minute's later Marie came into the room and saw me sitting there. 

 "You still up? I thought you would be in bed asleep by now." 

 I held up the book, "I got into it and I didn't realize how late it was." 

 "Well I'm ready for bed, I'm beat. I didn't think we would ever get that inventory to balance. I was afraid I was going to have to sleep at my desk tonight." 

 I stared at her. "You have been at work fighting an inventory problem all night?" 

 "Yes, and I'd still be there if Sarah hadn't found that the problem was that the wrong data had been fed into the computer. The old GIGO problem - garbage in, garbage out." 

 I put a bookmark in the book to mark my place, put the book down and went to bed. I didn't sleep well that night; I didn't sleep well at all. 

 +++++++ 

 It was three days later when Marie said she had to work late again. 

 "There's a tuna casserole in the fridge. Give it four minutes in the microwave. I should be home by ten," she said just before she kissed me and left. 

 I was outside her office in a borrowed car at four forty-five. Her normal quitting time was five so I only had fifteen minutes to kill if she wasn't really working late. At five after five people started streaming out of the building and at five-ten Marie came out and walked to her car. She pulled off the lot and I let three cars get between us before I pulled out and followed. Ten minutes later she pulled into the parking lot of the Sea Breeze Motel and sat in her car and waited. Five minutes later a black Dodge Ram 2500 pulled up next to her and Tom Hennesy got out and walked over to Marie, who had rolled down her window, and he leaned into the car and kissed her. Then he went to the office and five minutes later he came out and walked to room 134. Marie got out of her car and joined him and together they entered the room. 

 I guess I was wrong about Marie not being interested in sex anymore - she just wasn't interested in having it with me. I wondered how long she and Tommy had been hanging horns on me. No matter I thought, the marriage hadn't been much more than a comfortable existence for a year or so anyway. 

 +++++++ 

 I was surprised at my reaction to finding out. A couple of years earlier and I would have kicked down the door and beat Tommy within an inch of his life, painted a big red A on Marie's forehead and then thrown her naked out into the street. Now, for some reason I just didn't care enough to expend the energy. I took the borrowed car back, picked up mine and went on home. 

 I sat in the living room staring at the wall and taking stock of the situation. I was forty-six years old, had a decent job and a cheating wife. I was living a comfortable life and the question facing me was did I want to disrupt it. Confronting Marie would only lead to divorce. There was no chance for forgiveness or reconciliation because I just didn't care about her enough anymore to make it worth the effort. 

 Divorce would mean selling the house and splitting the assets and knowing about divorce courts in our state I knew I would get the shaft and end up having to pay for her lawyer and mine. I would end up living in a one bedroom apartment somewhere. Fuck that shit! The simplest solution was to ignore what Marie was doing and get on with life, but how was I supposed to do that? How could I just ignore things? I couldn't. To continue on would mean that I would still have to have sex with Marie even if it was only two or three times a month. It would mean that I would still have to be, or appear to be, a loving husband. I could pull that off, but no way was I going to be fucking another man's whore. 

 +++++++ 

 For the next five weeks I followed Marie on the nights she said she had to work late and each night she met Tommy at the Sea Breeze. I was not punishing myself, just trying to establish that Tom was the only one she was seeing. 

 Twice during that five week period Marie indicated that she wanted to make love and both times I avoided it. I stopped cuddling up to her in bed, but if she snuggled up to me I didn't push her away. I still kissed her goodbye in the morning when we left for work, but it was more of a 'kissing your sister' kind of kiss than a loving one. I did absolutely nothing to let Marie know that I even suspected something. 

 A year went by during which I faked a medical condition known as "acute erectile dysfunction" to keep from having sex with Marie, but it was also a year during which I had no sex at all. One day I asked myself, "What the fuck is wrong with you? Just because Marie is a whore is no reason for you to be celibate. You don't owe the bitch fidelity anymore. She trashed her vows and that releases you from yours." 

 And then there was the revenge factor. After a year of thinking about it I decided that for my own piece of mind I needed to do something to get back at Marie and Tom, but what? The answer came to me one Saturday morning as I was shopping at Safeway. I was digging through the steak section at the meat counter looking for just the right size steaks for a barbecue when a voice behind me said: 

 "Hello stranger" and I turned to see Mary Hennesy, Tom's wife. Standing next to her was their twenty-two year old daughter Shelly. Mary was a handsome woman and she had always been able to cause a stirring in my shorts, but Shelly! All you could say about Shelly was that she was drop dead gorgeous and even that didn't do her justice. My cock twitched as I looked at the two women and I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if I could fuck both of them? Wouldn't that be a great revenge on Tom?" And just that quick I decided to give it a try. It wouldn't be easy, and it might never happen, but I could try. 

 Driving home from Safeway I considered ways to go about getting Mary and Shelly and decided that I would need to know a lot more about them. Now that I knew what I was going to try to do to get even with Tom I turned my attention to what to do to Marie. Why not go after both of her sisters. Yeah, why not? 

 +++++++ 

 I knew where Mary worked and so I parked down the block and when she got off work I followed her. I quickly found that on Tuesdays and Thursdays she stopped after work for drinks with several of the girls she worked with. It was always the same bar and I figured it was because the place had live music to dance to. Once I knew that I stopped following Mary and switched to Shelly. 

 I found out that Shelly was a party animal. She too stopped at the bar after work with her co-workers, but she did it every night of the week. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday she stopped at Spiro's, a sports bar, and Thursday and Friday she hit the Pink Poodle Lounge. I assumed the she stopped at the Pink Poodle for the same reason her mother stopped at Henry's Lounge - for the live music. My basic plan formed in my mind. I would go after both women at the bars. 

 I decided to go after Shelly first. Not many twenty-two year olds are going to be interested in a forty-six year old man, but if I could catch Shelly at just the right time with enough booze on board anything was possible. The sports bar was going to be full of studs her own age so I decided to after Shelly at the Poodle. 

 Question: How does a forty-six year old man go after a twenty-two year old girl? 

 Answer: He doesn't. 

 Shelly got of work at six and was usually at the Poodle by six-thirty. The band set up at a quarter to seven and began their sets at seven. I got there at six- fifteen and took a seat at the end of the bar and surveyed the crowd while I waited. I had checked the place out and I knew that it was a stopping place for office workers from several businesses in the area. There were three groups of women sitting around tables drinking, laughing and having a good time. Several of them were my age or close to it and I assumed that they were from the office buildings in the neighborhood. 

 At six twenty-five Shelly came in with four other girls and sat at a table just off the dance floor. I sipped my vodka tonic and waited for the band to start playing. Once the band started I kept my eye on the three groups of women until I saw what I was looking for. A couple of them were beating time on the table with their fingers while watching the dance floor. I got up, approached the table and asked one of them to dance and she said yes and then after that I asked another one and another one after that. After dancing with three women from the table I was asked if I would like to join them and I did. 

 I ignored Shelly, that is to say that I didn't even acknowledge that I knew she was there. I danced with all the women at the table and around ten-thirty one of them said she needed to get on home to her husband and she got up to leave. I said I needed to get going too and I also got up and we walked out together. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Shelly watching and I know what she was thinking - "He scored." 

 The next night I did the same thing, was invited to join the ladies, danced with them until around ten when one said she had to go and I said I did too and we walked out together. Again I saw Shelly watching us go. 

 Those two nights set the pattern for the next three weeks. I paid no attention to Shelly and I walked out each night with a woman. I started to think that my plan wasn't going to work. I decided to give it one more week and if what I hoped for didn't happen I would have to sit down and come up with another plan. 

 It was Friday night and I was sitting at the bar and watching the band set up when Shelly and two of her girlfriends came in and sat down at a table. A couple of minutes went by and then the band started to play and I was looking at the table where the five women who worked at the bank were sitting and getting ready to go ask one for a dance when Shelly got up from her table and came over to me. 

 "My friends and I would like you to join us." 

 "Why would you want to do that?" 

 "We like to dance too and it is obvious that you are never going to come over and ask one of us so we decided to ask you." 

 "Bull shit young lady. The guys swarm around you and I see you out on the floor most of the night." 

 "Well, can we just say that there is some interest in you?" 

 "Shelly, you are not a stupid lady. You know why I am here and what I am doing. I don't ask you or your friends to dance because girls your age are not interested in men my age. We both know I'm here for more than the dancing." 

 "Some women like older men and Anna, the cute blond, is fascinated by the fact that you always score. She knows that women talk and those women must not be saying bad things about you because they keep leaving with you." 

 "There is a sure thing for me over at that table where the women from the bank are sitting Shelly. There are no sure things sitting at your table." 

 "Oh come on Mr. Fazio, take a chance." 

 +++++++ 

 As I toyed with her nipple she asked: 

 "Are you sorry you ended up with me?" 

 "Not at all baby girl. You were, or I should say are, magnificent. Just what it takes to bring out the best in an old man." 

 "Not so old and I certainly do like your best. Can I ask you something?" 

 "What?" 

 "Why do you leave with a different woman every night? Why don't you pick one and stay with her?" 

 "I don't want to get involved in a continuing relationship." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because I'm married Shelly, and I'm not going to divorce Marie. All I can offer a woman is a fleeting experience, hopefully an enjoyable one, but I can offer nothing long term. And in truth, most of the women I've left the Poodle with seem to feel the same way. Most of them have husbands waiting at home for them so I keep things simple - one night stands." 

 She slid her hand down my body to my crotch and her fingers played with my flaccid cock. It stirred and she said: 

 "I think it wants to play again." 

 "I've no doubt that it does." 

 "I don't want to be a one night stand, but I don't want a long term relationship either. Can we play for a while?" 

 "What do you mean when you say "for a while?" 

 "Maybe two days a week until my boyfriend comes back from Iraq. I need sex, but I don't like one night stands with guys I don't really know." 

 "How long before he comes home?" 

 "In his last letter he said five more months." 

 "I don't know Shelly. It would be very difficult to hide it from your mom and dad." 

 "No it wouldn't. I moved into my own apartment two months ago." 

 "Five months, no strings and we part friends?" 

 "No, we part lovers." 

 "I don't know if I'm up to something like that." 

 "Don't you worry about that old man, I'll get you up for it" and she bent down and took my cock in her mouth. 

 I don't recover as quickly as I used to when I was younger, but on the up side I last a lot longer when I do get up. Just the thought of the twenty-two year old sexy girl was enough to make my cock twitch and her mouth did the rest. When I was stiff she moved over me and then using her hand to guide her she sat down on my cock and began to ride me. I just lay there and looked up at her swinging tits and thought, "How sweet it is. Getting my revenge and loving it." 

 She rocked back and forth for a couple of minutes and then she rose up and slammed herself down on my cock and as she lifted herself to do it again I put my arms around her, rolled over on top of her and began fucking her as hard as I could. Her nails were biting into my back and she was telling me to fuck her and make her cum. I slammed into her and reached under her and cupped the cheeks of her ass in my hand and pulled her to me as I kept driving. Minutes went by and her heels were beating on the backs of my legs and sweat was rolling off me as I tried to make myself cum. If I could get myself close I knew I'd bring her off too. I felt it start in my balls and I moaned into Shelly's ear: 

 "Cum for me baby, cum for me, I'm almost there and I don't want to leave you hanging." 

 "Pinch my nipples" she panted, "Pinch my nipples" and I did and her body shook as she screamed out, "OH GOD!" and came like a freight train and her body spasms were all it took to get me off. 

 +++++++ 

 I left the motel with a spring to my step and a key to Shelly's apartment in my pocket. Tom would never know that I had fucked his baby, but I would and I would smile and think about it every time I saw him. My smile would be even bigger if I managed to nail his wife too, but my pursuit of Mary was going to have to wait until my affair with her daughter was over. Five months Shelly had said. Five months to find out everything about Mary that I could. 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** Becoming A Slut Husband: Tony (2) ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© She met me at the door with an intense kiss and then she pulled me along to the bedroom. She pushed me back on the bed and fumbled with my zipper and my belt and then she pulled my pants all the way off me. Her hand took hold of my erection and she bent her head and kissed and licked the head of it before taking it into her mouth. She wrapped her lips tightly around my dick and then she gave me the blow job of dreams. She worked on my cock with her mouth and her hands played with my balls until I couldn't hold back any longer and I let it go. She swallowed every last drop and then lifted her head, smiled at me and said: 

 "Did you like that?" 

 "Oh god yes, did I ever." 

 "Good, I liked doing it for you." 

 She lowered her head and went back to licking and sucking on me until she had me hard again. She climbed over me and lowered herself down until the head of my cock was at her opening, hesitated a fraction of a second and then she took me all the way in her with one solid downward push. She moved up and down, she rocked back and forth, she went slowly for a bit and then she slammed down hard for a bit. She brought me to the edge twice and then pulled back on me to keep me hanging. 

 Finally I had to cum and I wrapped my arms around her and rolled her over onto her back and drove myself into her. I reached under her and took the cheeks of her ass in my hands and pulled her to me as I fucked her with hard strokes. Her body trembled as she had an orgasm and then I released mine into her. 

 ++++++ 

 Lying next to each other and looking at the ceiling while trying to catch our breath she said: 

 "I've got some good news and some bad news lover." 

 "Let me have the good news first." 

 "I heard from Derek last night. He will be home in two weeks." 

 "What is good about that?" 

 "You didn't want a long term relationship so in two weeks this one will be over." 

 "What's the bad news?" 

 "I heard from Derek last night. He will be home in two weeks." 

 "Then I guess we had better make the most of those fourteen days" and I bent my head and took her right nipple in my mouth. 

 ++++++ 

 I had used my five months (four months and twelve days actually) to learn as much as I could about Shelly's mother. I already knew about her stopping for drinks every Tuesday and Thursday. I found out that she and Tom were not getting along all that well and I wondered if maybe it was because Mary suspected that Tom was running around on her. 

 I found out that every other Friday she had a 'girls night out' with some old friends of hers. I learned that her favorite color was blue, that her favorite drink was a margarita, that her taste in music ran toward the yucky - Mannilow and Sinatra - and that she hated seafood. I had thought that I was being subtle in my looking for information and then one night Shelly let me know that I wasn't as slick as I thought I'd been, 

 "Why all the interest in my mom?" 

 I tried to make a joke of it. "What is it they say? Like mother, like daughter? If you are like your mother I might give her a shot when you and I are over." 

 "My mother? You would go after my mother?" 

 I laughed it off as best I could and hoped that she wasn't close enough to her mom to go home and laughingly tell her to look out for me. 

 What I did not learn was anything I could use in taking my shot at Mary. I knew where I could take that shot - at the bars where she stopped - but nothing I could use for a way in so to speak. I didn't think that the method I used on Shelly would work with Mary because Shelly was single and a little on the wild side whereas Mary was a wife and mother and a little more settled. I decided that I was going to have to learn more about Mary than I already knew. 

 It was the first weekend that Derek was home and I was at loose ends so Friday night found me parked down the street from Mary's house. If I was right that night was one of her night out Fridays. At seven-ten she backed out of her drive and headed downtown. I gave her some distance and then I followed. She drove to the other side of town and pulled into the parking lot of the Black Saddle, a popular country/western bar, parked and went inside. I drove to the back of the lot and parked. 

 I'd been in the Saddle a couple of times and I knew the layout of the place. There was no way I could go in either door without being spotted. I didn't want to go in so soon after Mary so I settled down in my seat to wait a half hour. Thirty minutes later I got out of the car just as Mary came out the side door with a man in a cowboy hat. He had his right arm around her and his right hand was cupping her right tit. She was looking up into his face and she didn't see me right away. They stopped at a car, the man unlocked it and held the door for Mary as she climbed onto the back seat. It was as she entered the car that she saw me and even in the dark parking lot I saw the color drain from her face. 

 I walked right by and continued on into the building. I found an empty stool at the end of the bar, ordered a vodka tonic and then I settled down to watch. The place was loaded with women. A rough count showed that there were about three women for every two guys. It looked as if the Black Saddle had become a meat market since the last time I'd been in. I saw several of the ladies casting glances at me and two of them made eye contact and then smiled at me - invitations if I ever saw them - but I wasn't interested. Strange as it might sound, considering my time with Shelly, but I didn't cheat on my wife. I know I'm splitting hairs and playing word games here, but to go after one of the girls who had smiled at me would be cheating. What I did with Shelly, and hoped to do with her mother to me wasn't cheating, it was revenge. It was my way of sticking it to Tom for his sticking it in my wife. 

 As I sipped my drink, watched the action and kept an eye on the door Mary would have to walk back in through I considered what I now knew. Mary's night out with the girls was actually Mary's night out with the boys. I wondered if she made parking lot visits on Tuesdays and Thursdays when she stopped with the girls from work. I'd never stuck around after following her to see where she went. What I did now know was that my approach to Mary was going to be the same as the way I had gone after Shelly. I was going to let her come to me and if I was right it would be before the night was over. 

 It was about twenty-five minutes after I had passed Mary in the parking lot that she and her cowboy came back into the bar. As soon as the door closed behind them I saw her eyes sweeping the bar until she found me. Our eyes met and she quickly looked away as the cowboy led her over to a table where two other guys and three other girls were sitting. I found it interesting that one of the girls sitting at the table was one of the girls who had given me the smiling invitation. That opened up a possibility. 

 For the next twenty minutes Mary kept making nervous glances my way and then looking away when our eyes met. I waited until the next time she looked my way and then I got up from my barstool and headed for her table. She saw me coming and I saw what I thought was a worried look cross her face. I could see she was tensed up when I got to the table and whatever it was she was expecting wasn't what happened. I asked the woman who had smiled at me to dance. As we moved together out onto the dance floor she asked: 

 "What took you so long? 

 "I had a hard time talking myself into it." 

 "That isn't a good thing for my ego to hear." 

 "No sweetie, it had nothing to do with you. I'm married and I had to talk myself into ignoring that fact." 

 She laughed and said, "Sweetie, every one at that table is married, including me, and none of us are married to anyone currently in the building." 

 "That's the other part of my problem. I know the husband of one of the girls you are sitting with and she knows my wife." 

 "Who?" 

 "Mary." 

 "And you think she will tell your wife that you are out tomcatting? Let me tell you something sweetie; she is a bigger slut than I am and that is saying something and people who live in glass houses do not throw stones." 

 "Mary is a slut?" 

 "She's done every guy sitting at that table and a few more who are sitting at other tables. She won't rat you out sweetie, she'd be too scared of what you might tell her hubby." 

 We stayed out on the floor for two dances and chatted. Her name was Jackie, she was married and had three kids and her husband was gone a lot. When the music stopped and I walked her back to her table she invited me to join them. 

 "Sorry Jackie, but it would be too awkward for me." 

 "She won't bite sweetie and besides, it is a Mexican standoff. You can't tell on her or she would tell your wife that you came her to cheat." 

 "Well Jackie, that's the problem. I didn't come here to cheat. I was passing by and thought I'd drop in for a drink. Just imagine my surprise when I saw Mary climbing into a backseat with the guy in the cowboy hat. Her husband Tom is a damned good friend of mine and the only reason I came over here to ask you to dance was so I could pump you for information. Thanks for letting me know how big a slut Mary is. Her husband is going to love hearing about it." 

 "You bastard!" 

 "Sorry honey, but some of us take our vows seriously." 

 I walked back to the bar and sat down to finish my drink. Over at the table I saw Mary and Jackie with their heads together talking. Good. I'd gotten the ball rolling and now we would see what Mary would do. I finished my drink, left the bar and headed for my car. I was halfway across the parking lot when I heard, "Tony, wait up." I turned and saw Mary hurrying after me. I waited until she got to me and then she said: 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Tom's my friend Mary. What do you think I'm going to do?" 

 "Please don't do anything Tony, at least not until you and I have had a chance to talk." 

 "So talk Mary, I have the time." 

 "Not here Tony. Can you meet me at Spagnola's for lunch tomorrow, around noon?" 

 "I suppose I could, but why?" 

 "Just trust me on this Tony. Tom is not your friend. I'll explain it all tomorrow, okay?" 

 I stood there looking at her and she said, "Please Tony? It won't hurt you to wait a day. If you want to tell Tom about me after I talk to you go ahead, but please hear me out first." 

 "Okay Mary. I'll keep quiet until after lunch tomorrow." 

 "Thank you Tony. I'll see you tomorrow at noon" and she turned and headed back into the bar. 

 ++++++ 

 I was sitting in a corner booth at the restaurant when Mary came in. She slid onto the seat across from me and ordered a margarita from the waitress. 

 "First off Tony, I need to tell you that what you saw last night wasn't what you think it was." 

 "How many interpretations can put on a married woman climbing onto a back seat with a man not her husband?" 

 "And just what was your interpretation?" 

 "That you were cheating on Tom." 

 "That's not what it was. It wasn't cheating, it was getting even." 

 "Getting even?" 

 "Yes Tony, what I was doing was getting back at that son of a bitch." 

 "Getting back at him for what?" 

 "He has been running around on me for years and I finally caught the bastard." 

 "Tom? Cheating on you? No way Mary, no way." 

 "I thought that would be what you would say so I brought proof. Remember last night when I said that Tom was not your friend? This will show you what I mean." 

 She took a large envelope out of her purse and pushed it across the table to me. "What is it?" I asked. 

 "Just read it Tony and then tell me again about how Tom is your friend." 

 I did my best to act surprised as I read the report from the private detective. It was all there. Tom and Marie at the Sea Breeze three times during the week that he had followed them. The date was a good nine months before I had found out on my own. There were seven grainy pictures, but they were clear enough to show who the two people were and what they were doing. I tried to look shocked and I was actually able to make my hands tremble a bit as I held the report. 

 "Still think Tom is your friend?" 

 "Why didn't you bring this to me when you found out?" 

 "What, and make your life as miserable as mine? You didn't know and you seemed happy with Marie so why fuck you up? For all I know she still loves you, but needed a little excitement in her life. Hell, for all I knew you might have known and not cared. You might have been one of those guys that gets off on your wife getting it on with other guys. No, I figured the best thing for me to do was leave it alone." 

 "Why haven't you done anything about this?" 

 "I have. I get back at the bastard one night a week. I take what he considers his private stock and I give it away to anyone who wants it and then I go home, tell him I'm so hot for him I'm dripping and then I give him sloppy seconds. I've even managed to get the asshole to go down on me a couple of times when I've gone home freshly fucked." 

 "I don't mean that. I mean why haven't you thrown his ass out? Why haven't you divorced him?" 

 "Because I don't want to be a forty-four year old single woman living in an apartment or a condo. My idea of perfect revenge is to let him keep me in the style to which I've become accustomed while I fuck any man who catches my fancy." 

 "Can I have this?" I asked as I held up the report, "or at least a copy of it?" 

 "No" she said as she reached over and took it from me. "I don't want you going home and waving it under Marie's nose. Whatever you do with her leave Tom out of it. I like things just the way they are right now." 

 "It doesn't matter Mary, now that I know all I have to do is hire my own detective. I really won't even need to do that. I read the name of the agency on that report all I'll have to do is hire them and they'll charge for an hour because that's all the time they will need to pull that report out of the file and make me a copy." 

 "Please Tony, don't screw this up for me." 

 "It might surprise you Mary, but I don't want to be a forty-seven year old single man living in an apartment either, but I will need something like that report to use as leverage if the shit ever does hit the fan. I just wish I had known about this last night. If I would have known I probably could have had a little fun with Jackie." 

 Mary gave me a contemplative look and then she said, "Are you serious about that?" 

 "Damned straight I am." 

 "Well then, how about this. What could be sweeter than doing it with the wife of the man who is stabbing you in the back?" 

 "You mean that?" 

 "I don't have anywhere else I need to be this afternoon, how about you?" 

 ++++++ 

 The downtown Marriott was right across the street and I got a kick out of the fact that while Tom and Marie were meeting in a low rent motel on the seedy side of town Mary and I were in an upscale hotel with room service. I called down and ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate our afternoon together. Mary and I sipped champagne and necked like high school kids and then she got up and did a strip tease for me and when she was naked she spun around in front of me and said: 

 "You like?" 

 "Amazed is what I am. Marie ain't bad, but why any man would take her over you when it comes to a sexual partner is beyond me. That is a body to die for." 

 "Well then get busy dying sweetie, we only have three hours and then I have to hurry home and fix dinner for my loving husband." 

 Mary did it all and she loved all of it. I ate her pussy and she sucked my cock and then we had a frenzied fuck. My limp cock no sooner fell out of her than she was on me in a sixty-nine to get me hard again. The second time was doggie style followed by another sixty-nine and then she told me she wanted me to take her in her ass. 

 "I never let Tom do me there because I thought the very idea was disgusting. One of my lovers convinced me to give it a try just so I could smile sweetly at Tom knowing that I'd given someone else something that I had never given him and would never give him. It turns out that I like it. I like it a lot. Put your cock in my pussy and get some of our juices on it and then take my ass Tony, fuck my ass good." 

 I pushed my fingers into her cunt and got them wet and then I worked them into her ass as I stroked into her pussy with my cock. When I thought she might be ready I pushed my cock at her anal rosebud and she shoved her ass back at me and I slid right in. She was tight and her sphincter muscle acted like a hand trying to clutch me as I drove back and forth in her butt. She hissed and moaned and pushed back at me and begged me to fuck her harder, to make her cum and to cum in her. 

 I wasn't as young as I used to be and I had already cum twice in Mary so it took me a long time before I got to the point where I was ready to cum. By the time I emptied my balls into her for the third time Mary had had at least three orgasms which amazed the hell out of me because I didn't know a woman could get an orgasm from anal sex. 

 As she was getting dressed Mary said, "I don't really need to go out on Friday nights any more, do I?" 

 "Is that an invitation?" 

 "No, it is a request." 

 I smiled and said, "A gentleman should always honor a lady's request, but does it only have to be on Friday?" 

 "No baby, any time during the day when we can both get away from work; Tuesdays and Thursday from five until nine and Friday's from five until midnight. And then, if you're not worn out, Saturday and Sunday when Tom goes to play golf, which usually means when Tom goes to meet Marie. That enough for you?" 

 ++++++ 

 As I drove home I wondered if there was any other way to fuck over Tom. His mother, although in her mid sixties, was still a fine looking woman, but no, I didn't want to burn up the time it would take to seduce her. She and Tom's dad had been happily married for over forty years so why do anything that might screw that up. I'd done what I could to Tom. He would never know, but I would and that was all that counted. Now it was time to see what I could do to Marie. 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** Becoming A Slut Husband: Tony (3) ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© The choices I had when it came to getting back at Marie were limited. She had two good looking female cousins, but Angelina was a lesbian and so I scratched her off the list. Fiona was just recently married and she was still a starry eyed, blushing bride so apart from using a date rape drug or getting her totally drunk and taking advantage of her she was a dead end. Besides, either of those two methods might bring things to light and that was the last thing I wanted. My revenge against Marie needed to be the same as my revenge against Tom. I needed to do it and be able to smile at her knowing that I had done it and that she didn't know. After all, isn't that what she was doing to me? 

 Her mother was out. While Mrs. DeLuca had been a raving beauty in her younger days she had become your typical Italian-American grandmother, stout, bosomy and gray hair up in an unbecoming bun. That left only two possibilities - her sister Veronica and her sister Rosario. Rosario was married to a nice guy and I liked him well enough not to make him a cuckold. On the other hand, if I were to find out that Rosario was out slutting around all bets would be off. That left Ronnie. 

 Veronica was on her third husband and I didn't like him. No need to go into the reasons for it, I just didn't like him. The first two were history because, depending on who you talked to, they had been caught running around on her or she had been caught running around on them. Marie and the rest of the family took Ronnie's side that it was them, but a guy I knew pretty well who knew one of her ex's told me that the ex had told him he had caught Ronnie doing the dirty on the back seat of a car. He had become suspicious of her and had followed her on one of her nights out with the girls. I didn't know which story was true, but for my purposes I hoped it was the back seat one. 

 Ronnie was a lot closer to home than Shelly or Mary so I was going to have to very careful if I was to keep Marie in the dark. I had pretty much burned up my comp days and sick leave following Marie, Shelly and Mary so when it came to Ronnie I was going to have to operate blind. My only exposure to her was at family events and, fortunately, there were plenty of those. Again, I was going to go with what had worked for me so far; I would let Ronnie make the first move. If she never did I would move on to Plan B (once I figured out what Plan B was). 

 I started watching Ronnie at anniversary and birthday parties. I was never far from her at christenings; weddings or funerals and I made sure that every time she looked in my direction I was looking at her. When her eyes met mine I didn't smile, but I didn't look away either. This went on for about two months. It was at the wedding reception for one of Alphonse's daughters that it finally got to her. About two hours into the reception while, Marie was out on the dance floor with her dad, Ronnie came over and sat down across from me at our table. 

 "Why are you always watching me Tony?" 

 "Why, don't you like being watched?" 

 "All women like to be looked at Tony, but there is looking and then there is watching and they are not the same." 

 "Why don't we just say that you are a good looking woman and I like looking at good looking women." 

 "Bullshit Tony. Most of the women in this family are good looking, but you aren't watching them, you are watching me." 

 "Yes, I guess I am." 

 "Why?" 

 "You won't like it. You'll get pissed if I tell you and you might even slap my face and I wouldn't want that to happen in front of family." 

 "Now I am even more curious. I promise I won't slap you so tell me, why are you always watching me?" 

 "I'm trying to picture you on a back seat. Would you have one leg over he front seat and one leg over the back of the back seat or would you have both knees pulled back to your chest and your legs spread wide. Or maybe your legs would be spread wide and pointed straight up with your high heels almost ripping the headliner." 

 "You are a sick bastard Tony." 

 "No Ronnie, just a curious one" I said and then I got up and walked away from the table. 

 For the rest of the party every time I looked her way she was watching me. Good, I thought, I've planted the seed and now all I can do is water it and hope that it grows. The watering was simply to keep watching Ronnie. If she was the slut that I had been led to believe she was she would not let it lie. She would pick at it like a scab. 

 Two weeks later we were at a birthday party for Marie's grandmother and when Ronnie and her husband arrived I made sure that I was watching whenever she looked my way. It was an hour before she came over to me. 

 "Well Tony, what's going on in that sick little mind of yours tonight?" 

 "Same thing Ron, only with more questions. Do you have on nylons and a garter belt or thigh highs with elastic tops? Do you carry a spare pair in your purse in case you get sperm stains on the ones you are wearing?" 

 "You are disgusting Tony." 

 "True, but I'm not the one who likes back seat romances. At least I didn't think I did, but after talking with Hal I'm not so sure." 

 "Hal? Who is Hal?" 

 "Just a guy who has seen you in action. Excuse me, I need to use the john" and I walked away from her. 

 Hal was they guy who knew the ex-husband who said he had caught her having back seat fun. Hal hadn't seen a thing, but Ronnie didn't know that. Of course Ronnie might not have been caught on a back seat and if that were the case she would be calling Hal all kinds of a fucking liar the next time we talked. But if she had been caught on a back seat? 

 Ronnie was waiting for me when I came out of the bathroom. 

 "We have to talk Tony." 

 "Go ahead, I'm listening." 

 "No, not here. Someplace where we can't be overheard or interrupted." 

 "You call it." 

 "Meet me at Rico's for lunch tomorrow. Around noon, okay?" 

 "Whatever you want Ron, just don't hurt me" and I gave her a smile and walked back to the party. 

 ++++++ 

 The next day at Rico's she cut right to it. "Who is Hal and what is he saying about me?" 

 Hal is the guy who was watching you play back seat games the night that Joey caught you." 

 "Who have you told?" 

 "No one." 

 "Are you going to?" 

 "I haven't much thought about it." 

 "You watch me all the time, but you haven't thought about it?" 

 "No. What I'm thinking about when I'm watching you is what you look like being a wanton slut." 

 "Can't you be nice Tony? Do you have to talk to me that way?" 

 "Hey Ron, I was happy just doing my watching and letting my imagination run wild. You are the one got us talking about it." 

 "What do you mean, letting your imagination run wild?" 

 "Oh come on Veronica. You know I've had the hots for you since you put on your first training bra." 

 "Bullshit Tony. You've never said anything, not even once." 

 "Of course I didn't. You were four years older than I was. At sixteen you wouldn't have even looked my way. Age meant a lot when we were kids. You were looking at older guys, not younger ones. It wasn't until we hit our late twenties and early thirties that age didn't seem to matter any more and by then we were both married so I never had a chance to take a shot at you. Anyway, I've never stopped lusting after you. Couldn't do anything about it, but after what Hal told me I can fantasize and what I fantasize about most is you on a back seat." 

 "And you see you there with me?" 

 "All the time Ron, all the time." 

 "It won't happen Tony; you do know that right?" 

 I just smiled at he and said, "Would you like dessert, or should I call for the check?" 

 ++++++ 

 I could afford to take my time with Ronnie. I was getting more sex than a man my age could expect to get. Mary was meeting me three times a week and Shelly would call me occasionally when Derek was out of town. She called me every night for two weeks when Derek had to do his two weeks of Reserve training so I didn't push Veronica. 

 Months went by and I saw her at maybe six family functions and I continued my little game, I watched her. When she looked my way and saw me watching her I would smile. 

 When it happened it was sudden and unexpected. It was at an engagement party for one of Marie's cousins. Marie had begged off claiming a migraine, but I knew that the real reason was that she hated Christine's guts. We are a close family so I went to put in an appearance - to show the flag as it were - and I only planned on staying just long enough to be polite. I was just saying my good-byes when there was a hell of a row coming from the kitchen and it sounded like Ronnie and her husband were really going at it. I was halfway down the front walk when I heard Ronnie call my name and I turned and saw her hurrying down the walk toward me. I waited until she caught up with me and said: 

 "What's up?" 

 "I need a ride home. Mario and I just had a fight and I don't want to be around the asshole." 

 "It sounded kind of serious." 

 "I caught the bastard with his hands on Claudine's tits." 

 "Well, if you have to put your hands on tits Claudine's would definitely be the way to go." 

 "It isn't funny Tony, he embarrassed me in front of the whole family." 

 "So find a way to get back at him." 

 "Like what?" 

 "I don't know, just find some way to get even." 

 We reached my car, got in and pulled away. We rode in silence for maybe five minutes and then Ronnie moved over next to me, put a hand on my leg and said: 

 "Find us a place." 

 "What?" 

 "Find us a place. You want to know what I'm like on a back seat so find us a place." 

 "Do you know what you are doing Ron?" 

 "It is your idea." 

 "My idea?" 

 "You said find a way to get even." 

 "Yeah, but I'm not sure that I want you going home and telling him that I did you." 

 "I'm not going to tell him. I'll be even with him and I'll know it and that's all that counts." 

 I didn't give her a chance to change her mind. I hung a U-turn and drove back to where I work. I used my key to unlock the gate and pulled my car into the yard and then I closed the gate behind me and locked it. I drove over and parked between two Case front-end loaders and Ronnie was already on the back seat by the time I turned off the ignition. 

 Before climbing into the back I slid the seat all the way forward. Ronnie already had her panties off and was on her hands and knees as I moved behind her. My cock was at the entrance to her pussy and as soon as she felt it she pushed her ass back at me and my cock slid right into her pussy. She gave a loud squeal as I buried myself in her and she said: 

 "Give it to me, shove it in me hard Tony. Fuck me lover, fuck me hard. I love the feel of your cock in me Tony, use it, fuck me, fuck me hard." 

 I gripped her hips and slammed myself into her. She moaned, grunted and pushed hard back at me. I banged her hard for several minutes and then I felt the build up in my balls and I told her I was going to cum. 

 "Do it, do it" she moaned and I rammed her hard and the cum boiled out of my cock. I pulled out and Ronnie turned around and took my slime covered cock in her hand and stroked it a couple of times. Then she moved her body so she could get into a position where she could suck my cock and she went to work on getting me back to life. It took her a bit, but she got me up and then she gave me a wicked grin as she lay down on her back. 

 "How do you want it Tony? One leg over the back of the front seat and one leg over the back of the back seat? Or maybe my knees pulled back to my chest and my legs spread wide? How about my legs spread wide and pointing straight up so the heels on my shoes can have a chance at ripping your headliner?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Yes?" 

 "Yes to all of those as long as I can get my cock back into that hot box of yours." 

 "Stop talking Tony and do it." 

 ++++++ 

 "Well, was it what you had imagined?" 

 "It was better that I thought possible." 

 "You do know that it is a one time thing right?" 

 "Yeah, but the watching won't stop. From now on I'll be watching and remembering instead of watching and imagining." 

 "You had better get me home. Mario will be curious if I'm not home when he gets there." 

 "What if he's already there?" 

 "He won't be. His macho pride won't let him leave until he is one of the last ones there. If he left any earlier it would look like he was running home to beg me for forgiveness." 

 When I crawled into bed next to Marie that night I was very pleased with myself. I had gotten back at Tom and Marie and neither of them knew. I fell asleep with a smile on my face. 

 ++++++ 

 A week went by and one Wednesday morning I got a phone call from Ronnie. 

 "Can you stop by on your way home from work tonight?" 

 "I could. What's up?" 

 "I need to talk to you about something." 

 "What?" 

 "I'll tell you tonight. What time do you think you can be here?" 

 "Quarter after six." 

 "See you then." 

 I spent the rest of the day wondering what she wanted to talk about. Did Mario find out about what we'd done? Did she get in a shouting match with him and throw it in his face? Did what she have to say have anything to do with what Mario was planning to do about it? The worst he could do was tell Marie and I didn't care about that. If Marie started any shit over it I would just bring up Tom and we would go from there. 

 It turned out that it wasn't any of those. When I rang her doorbell at ten after six she opened the door and greeted me wearing nothing except for a pair of high heels. 

 "Give you any ideas Tony?" She reached down and felt my hardening cock and giggled and then said, "I can see that it does." 

 "Excuse me for looking a gift piece in the mouth here, but where is Mario? He into watching? He's hiding in the closet maybe?" 

 "Mario is gone. It seems that the other night wasn't the first time he had his hands on Claudine's tits. The two of them have run off together so I figured that I needed to do a little more getting even. You up to it?" 

 She reached down and touched my bulge again. "I can see that you are. We could go out to your car and use the backseat if you would prefer, but my bed is a lot more comfortable." 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** Becoming A Slut Husband: Tony (4) ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© Ronnie gave me a key and for the next two months I stopped by to see her two or three times a week on my way home from work. One evening I got there and found a note telling me that she had to do something, but I could wait she would be back in an hour. I had nothing better to do than go home to Marie and pretend to be a loving husband so I decided to wait. 

 I was sitting at the kitchen table sipping a beer when I heard the front door open. After about five minutes when Ronnie hadn't come into the kitchen I got up to go and see where she was. I walked out of the kitchen and into the dining room and stopped in my tracks. I was looking into the living room and I saw that I wasn't the only one that Veronica had given a key. 

 Sitting on the couch with her blouse open and her bra hanging loose and her skirt up to her waist was Rosario. Sitting with her, one hand on her right tit and the other inside her panties was a man who wasn't her husband. They hadn't noticed me yet and Rosario moaned out as the man finger fucked her: 

 "No fair, I need something too." 

 The man stood up, dropped his pants and stood in front of Rosario with his cock inches from her face. She giggled and said, "That's more like it" and leaned forward to take the cock in her mouth and it was then that she noticed me. Her face turned ashen and she jerked back from the man. He said, "What's the matter" and then he saw where she was looking and he turned and saw me. 

 "Who the fuck are you?" 

 I didn't like his attitude or his tone of voice so I said: 

 "I'm the guy who is going to tell her husband about the two of you" and I turned and went back into the kitchen. On the way I heard Rosario say: 

 "Damn it Roger, why did you have to talk to him that way. All you did was piss him off." 

 "You want I should go in there and have a man to man with him? Straighten his ass out?" 

 "Get out Roger, just get out." 

 A minute or two later I heard the front door slam and a minute after that a very worried Rosario came into the kitchen. I was at the sink washing my hands and when I had dried them I turned and saw her standing there looking at me and biting her lower lip. She took a deep breath and then asked: 

 "Are you really going to tell Steve about this?" 

 "I should Rosie, especially since Steve is a nice guy and that asshole you were just with is just that, an asshole." 

 "Please don't tell on me Tony." 

 I stood there looking at Rosario and something in my head snapped. Up to that point I hadn't forced myself on anyone or pushed anyone into doing something they didn't want to do. Shelly, Mary and Veronica all had made the first move. Granted, I had fished and finagled to get them to make that move, but the bottom line was it was still their choice. 

 I stood there looking at Rosario and it was like I was standing there looking at Marie. The two were the same. They both had good husbands, husbands who loved them and treated them right and they both stabbed those husbands in the back. I was calm on the outside, but fuming on the inside when he said: 

 "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't tell Steve." 

 "He would throw me out of the house." 

 "And you don't think you would deserve it?" 

 "I couldn't face mom and dad if that happened." 

 "How bad do you want me to keep quiet?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Tell you what Rosie, you want me to keep my mouth shut all you have to do is come over here and open yours." 

 "What?" 

 "Come over here, get down on your knees and suck my cock." 

 "God Tony, I can't do that." 

 "Why not? You were only half a second from doing it to that dirtbag you brought here." 

 "But that was different Tony." 

 "A blow job is a blow job Rosie. It's your choice. Open your mouth or I open mine." 

 "You promise you won't tell Steve?" 

 "You suck my cock and I won't be able to. I tell on you and then you tell on me right?" 

 I saw a little bit of a smile form. "How about this Tony? You tell Steve and then I tell everybody you are lying because I wouldn't put out for you? You say nothing and we all live happily ever after." 

 "Nice try Rosie, but it won't work. For one thing, I won't give a rats ass if you everyone that story. For another, I know where to find your boyfriend. He drinks at Benny's Tavern and when I haul his ass in front of the family and squeeze his head like a pimple he will be more than happy to tell all about your little affair. All you've done with your threat is piss me off. Now get over here, get my cock out and get to sucking on it or get ready to face a very upset husband. 

 Her lips quivered and she spit "Bastard!" at me, but she came over and went to her knees in front of me. I stood there while she pulled my zipper down and fished out my cock. She held it in her hand and looked at it and then she looked up at my face as if hoping I'd say something like, "Just kidding Rosie" but I looked down on her with a "get with it" look on my face. I saw the resignation in her eyes and then she leaned forward and took me in her mouth. 

 For a blow job that Rosie acted like she didn't want to give she sure did a fine job. She wrapped her warm lips around my cock and then she sucked on the head. Her hand reached into my shorts for my balls and then softly rubbed them. She pulled her head back and licked the tip for several seconds and then she took me so far into her mouth that I felt my cock touch the back of her throat. She made a slight choking sound and then she started bobbing her head as she fucked her mouth with my dick." 

 After about four minutes I pulled my dick out of her mouth and took her by the arms and stood her up. "What are you doing?" she cried as I spun her around and bent her over the kitchen table. I pushed my knees between her legs and pushed them apart as I pulled her skirt up to her waist. 

 "No Tony, no. Please don't do that. You said a blow job, just a bl...aaargggh," that last the sound she made as I shoved the gusset of her panties aside and rammed my cock into her. 

 "Oh no, oh God no, don't cum in me Tony, please don't cum in me. I'll suck you off for a week Tony, just pull out, please pull out." 

 "What? You could fuck that dirtbag, but I'm not good enough for you?" 

 "He had condoms. Please don't fuck me Tony, please don't." 

 "I'll cum in your mouth Rosie. I'm gonna fuck you Rosie, I'm gonna fuck you like the tramp you are, but I'll pull out and cum in your mouth." 

 "No Tony, you won't stop, I know you won't. Please Tony, let me suck you off." 

 She was probably right, I probably wouldn't stop and pull out. In my mind Rosario and Marie had merged into one and I wanted to punish, I wanted to hurt, I wanted to make their cheating asses pay, but at the same time I didn't want to take a chance on sticking Steve with a kid that wasn't his. The entire time she had been talking I had been fucking her and I really didn't want to stop and then I grinned. Next to the salt and pepper shaker I saw the butter dish. I reached for it and loaded my fingers and then shove one of them in Rosario's asshole. 

 "Aaaahhhh, what are you doing?" 

 "I'm going to cum in your body Rosie, not your mouth. You don't want me to cum in your pussy fine, I'll cum in your ass instead." 

 "Oh God no Tony, I've never done that." 

 "Your choice Rosie, pussy or ass, but you had better hurry up and chose." 

 I was pounding her hard and she was moaning and grunting as I slammed into her. I had two fingers in her ass by then, working at loosening her up. I had no idea where she might be in her cycle and I'd already decided that I was going to shoot my load in her ass so Steve wouldn't end up with a kid that looked like me. 

 I had just worked a third finger into Rosie's ass when she said: 

 "My ass, use my ass Tony, don't cum in my pussy Tony, please, not my pussy." 

 I pulled out of her cunt and put my cock against her puckered asshole. "Don't hurt me Tony, please don't hurt me" she cried and I smiled as I thought, "But I want to hurt you Rosie. I want to punish you for being a cheating whore" and I pushed my cock and it popped past her sphincter. She let out a sharp yelp and then she began moaning and they weren't moans of pleasure. I pushed in an inch and she whimpered. Another inch and then another until I was all the way in her cheating cunt and then I started fucking her. 

 Her ass was tight and it felt like it was clutching at my cock as I worked it back and forth. Her whimpers turned into gasps, which turned into moans of what I took to be pleasure. Bent over the kitchen table Rosie's toes barely touched the floor and she had no leverage so I'll never know if Rosie got into her first anal enough to push her ass back at me, but verbally she got into it. Her "Oh God, oh God" moans gradually turned into a low hissing, "Yesss, yesss, yesss." I picked up the pace and was rewarded with, "Oh shit, oh fuck, so good, so good." 

 So much for punishment. The only punishment here would be for me to stop and leave her hanging, but I wasn't about to do that, I was too damned close to getting me off. I gripped her hips and drove into her several times as hard as I could and my release was only seconds away when Rosario's body seemed to stiffen and she screamed, "OH FUCK!!!" and I let my load go. 

 I was leaning over Rosie, my hands on the table propping me up as my cock was going soft in her butt, when the room reverberated with: 

 "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!" 

 I looked to my right and saw Veronica and she didn't look happy. I gave her a half-assed grin and she yelled, "Get the fuck out of here. Both of you, get out of here. I want you out of here right now. Both of you, MOVE!" 

 I got off Rosario and she got up and ran from the room. I started to open my mouth to say something, but Ronnie shot me an angry look and pointed at the door. 

 "OUT! Right now. Get your miserable fucking ass out of here and don't come back!" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It has been over a year now since Veronica sent me out her door. At family gatherings she and Rosario avoid me as much as possible without making it obvious, although the two of them seem to have made up. 

 Shelly still calls me from time to time when she's lonely. I don't know how much longer she will be calling though. She and Derek have finally set a date for their wedding. I don't know if the ring will make a difference when Derek has to do his two weeks Reserve training in the summer or when he does his one weekend a month or when his job takes him away from home. 

 I'm still seeing Mary two or three times a week. We briefly discussed pulling the plug on Tom and Marie and then moving in together, but then decided to keep things the way they are. 

 My relationship with Marie is cordial, but not much more. I'm still faking erectile dysfunction and she has stopped trying to get me to make love to her. She and Tom are still sneaking off twice a week and she still doesn't know that I know and I obviously don't care enough about her anymore to waste my time doing anything about it. 

 It is enough for me to know that I nailed both of her sisters and that I have fucked both the wife and daughter of her lover and that every night at the dinner table I can look at her and smile knowing that she hasn't put a fucking thing over on me. Report_Story
