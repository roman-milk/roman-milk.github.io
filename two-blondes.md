 ****** Two Blondes ****** byStoryTeller07Â© He had noticed Sandra in the office building, once or twice. It would be difficult not to. She seemed to be all tits and ass, with a little brain. The kind Jeff hated. She looked like the sort of arrogant woman who expects all men to swoon at her feet just for a smile. 

 Jeff found himself in one of the elevators with her, and to his amazement she started a conversation. 

 "Hi, I've seen you around. What do you do here?" she asked. 

 Jeff kept it simple and fought hard not to let the disdain show. It wasn't her fault she was beautiful, and that he had a problem with it. 

 "Would you join me for a coffee? I hate going into the restaurant alone," she asked. 

 Now, Jeff could see why men drool over big brassy blondes. Her shape was having an influence on his metabolism. OK! He was getting hot under the collar; a lot further down was getting hot. Jeff had never been a flirt or a woman chaser and he didn't have a line of chat like most guys. Most telling of all was that he hadn't had a girlfriend for a few months. Actually, it was more than a few months. That certainly seemed to be influencing his decision making skills, for he hadn't been heading for the canteen. 

 Fortunately she did most of the talking, while Jeff was mesmerized by a pair of deep blue eyes. It was fascinating the way she looked into the distance when recalling something, and closed them to figure something out then opened them wide, as though in astonishment, that she had recalled the idea she wanted. She was no genius, but the excitement and enthusiasm she brought to the conversation was like a whirlwind of disconnected ideas, eventually making sense. 

 She was just so full of life it took his breath away. 

 She stood up, dropping her bag, which Jeff caught, scooping it up. Like a sirocco, a desert wind, she whirled away from the table leaving him a little on the tilt. His prejudices had been shattered. Jeff felt like a pinball machine with dazzling lights in his head, flashing in meaningless patterns. He sat quietly, trying to make sense of what had just happened. 

 "Hi Jeff, what was all that about?" Mark asked. 

 "I'm not sure," Jeff admitted, before the thought could be edited. 

 Mark was one of those wise guys, who have to put you down to boost their own lack of self-esteem. In other words, he was an asshole. 

 "She's way out of your league man," Mark said, trying to sound serious. 

 Jeff knew something sarcastic was forming, for a routine follow-up, but nodded his head anyway, for it was true. She was a twenty-two year old innocent and he was a thirty-two year old cynic. Mark was right. There was no way, but Jeff hadn't thought about it that way, not for a moment. 

 "She's too young and dumb and you're too old and too boring. Believe me, it wouldn't work. Nothing to talk about afterwards," he sneered. 

 It was a good point, something to keep in mind, just to keep everything in proportion. The way he said it was just too hard hitting. It was insulting. Friends could slap you down but this guy was a jerk. 

 "I liked what she had to say; it was refreshing. She was interesting to talk to. So, does that make me dumb too?" Jeff asked. He shrugged, knowing that as a witty rejoinder, it was pretty woeful. As a well-paid consultant steering the project, he couldn't be called dumb, but yes, Jeff was dull. Life was dull! He thought about it and decided it was his own fault. He had let life become boring. 

 "Thank you, Jeff," Sandra said. 

 The light tinkle of Sandra's voice stopped another of Marks sneering remarks. Instead he settled for a snort of disgust and slunk off. 

 "That was nice of you to say such a thing," she added. She placed a small delicate hand on his shoulder. 

 Jeff was surprised by her presence and highly embarrassed she had heard the discussion. "It's true. You're so full of life it's a pleasure to talk to you. I enjoyed sharing ideas," he said, and quickly stopped, for he was in danger of babbling on forever. 

 "If that's true, you can take me out for a drink after work," she said. There was a teasing quality to the tone that made it a challenge. 

 His tongue felt as though it had swollen in his mouth, as much as his penis had shrunk in his trousers. He smiled, knowing not to grin like an idiot. "Sure, that would be nice," he said. 

 "Here's my number, call me later," she cooed. 

 He hoped she hadn't noticed he neglected to ask for it, as his brain had closed down. A fear of what he might be getting into had shrunk his penis to nothing, so a lack of blood flow was no excuse. He took a couple of deep breaths to relax. He thought through what had happened, how he had gotten into this. Did he really want to date this young woman? 

 He was an analyst, so he naturally tried to think through how they had met. In his mind he was getting into the elevator, pressing the button for the executive level. Damn! He had been on his way to a meeting. Scurrying off he walked in late but no one took any notice, as though he were invisible or invulnerable to criticism. Perhaps unimportant might have been nearer the mark. 

 *** 

 He picked her up from an ordinary apartment in an average part of town. There was no plaque on the building saying - "Miss Wonderful lives here." Their conversation was stilted and the local pub was quiet, so they had to make an effort. He mentioned his job but was aware enough not to bore her with details. After the second drink he ran out of questions, but she managed to keep the conversation flowing around them. 

 "Do you know why I asked you out?" she smiled. The smile wrinkled her nose up in a cute way that left him smiling pleasurably. He shook his head, not trusting himself to answer, feeling it would be sarcastic and a self-putdown. 

 "While we were talking in the canteen you looked me in the eye, rather than at my breasts. Men always do that. I don't blame them," she added, in a hurried breathy way he found charming. "When you defended me against that jerk, well, I couldn't help myself. You were so gallant, a Prince Charming, coming to my rescue," she gushed. 

 "It was the truth," he said, unsure as to what it was he was saying and where to go next. "They are nice, big, blue, lovely eyes. I enjoy the way you enthuse over ideas," he smiled, more in embarrassment than anything. She didn't seem to notice the awkwardness. 

 "Most men say that about my breasts, not my eyes," she laughed. "They never ask me anything either," she said, with the crinkled-brow expression she used when she thought. "You've asked me all sorts of things I hadn't thought about in ages. You're a nice, kind person. Thoughtful," she said, with her head tilted to one side. 

 "No, no more, I can't drink much. You can take me home now," she said, looking up at him with a vulnerable little expression. She gave him a curious look then smiled generously, with her whole face, not just the mouth. 

 *** 

 "Come on in," Sandra said, on seeing him hesitating at the door. She smiled, knowing he was wondering about the protocol of how to say goodnight. Should he shake hands, or go for a light peck on the cheek. 

 "How do you take your coffee?" Sandra asked. She turned her back to him, fiddling with the coffee machine. 

 Jeff took the opportunity to have a good look at her while she was working. She had long blonde hair almost down to her waist, which was slim over a nice rounded bottom. Her legs weren't long but they were very nicely shaped. From this angle it couldn't be guessed that she had a large pair of breasts. At twenty-two, her skin still had an attractive fresh youthful sheen. 

 He was suddenly shaken from his reverie as a young woman walked into the kitchen. She bent over, rummaging through a cupboard looking for something. Jeff felt as though he should look away, but the sight of her cute bottom, clad only in a pair of panties, was enthralling. 

 It was as though a duplicate image of Sandra had been set beside her, stripped down to her underwear. Showing off her voluptuous body and even more, she was bent over, allowing him to visually devour her beautiful ass. The two blondes were a perfect match, from where he sat at the kitchen table. 

 He turned away to look at a calendar, unable to see its summer scene, for wherever he looked the half naked figure was superimposed upon his retina. 

 "Louise, this is Jeff," Sandra said. 

 He watched Sandra turn around to see her friend frozen in place. Sandra stifled a laugh. 

 "Oh! I didn't hear anyone come in. I'm wearing my old comfy knickers," Louise began, but her mouth dried up, realizing she was sounding stupid. 

 Jeff automatically stood up and offered his hand. Louise stood with an empty coffee cup in one hand, with the other trying to cover her full breasts. Her legs were folded over each other to hide her crotch. Just as automatically her hand reached out to his. 

 Jeff succeeded in looking her in the eyes as he shook her hand. His nervousness made him pump too hard. In his peripheral vision her breasts were gyrating, as though he were putting her through a stripper's routine. He snatched his hand away mumbling a hello and a sorry. 

 Louise stood in the small kitchen wishing she had at the very least worn a decent set of underwear, and wondering if she should just run away. 

 "You've made an impressive entrance, my dear," Sandra smiled at her friend. "Sit down, I'll fill your mug," she smiled. "You might as well sit, he's seen it all and he's man enough not to gawp," she added. 

 Jeff looked at Sandra with a wan smile, hoping he hadn't been too obviously ogling her friend. 

 Louise plonked herself down at the table with the empty mug in her hand, proffering it to Sandra. The red of embarrassment had faded, leaving an impish look upon her face. "Coffee, coffee," she moaned in a near whisper, feigning a dry throat. 

 "Stop messing around and say hello to Jeff," Sandra told her friend. 

 "Hello, Jeff. Sorry about the lack of clothes but you seem to be able to handle me well," she said, and blushed. "I mean, handle it well," she added, with a little nervous laugh. 

 "Give up while you're ahead," Sandra advised her friend. 

 Jeff squirmed on the chair. He smiled at her and shrugged his shoulders. "This morning I didn't expect to be going out for a drink with a beautiful woman, now I'm drinking with two," he said, and laughed in embarrassment at the bad joke. 

 "We would be drinking, if the maid would get on with it," Louise said, in a stage whisper. 

 "The maid is trying her best with this damn machine," Sandra replied. 

 "Is she a good maid?" Jeff asked, trying to get into the game. 

 "She's too slow but I keep her on out of kindness. She needs a spanking to speed her up. Could you oblige, Jeff?" Louise said, with an imperious tone. 

 "Oh! Please don't spank me, miss! Here's your coffee, miss, and yours, sir," Sandra said, in an exaggerated subservient little voice. She curtsied to both of them as they laughed along with her. 

 "What do you think?" Louise asked, after taking a sip. 

 "Nice," he said. "Very nice," he added, while looking at Sandra. 

 "Doesn't look as though the maid will receive a well deserved spanking then," Louise said, with a wink at Sandra. 

 "Oh? Maybe later," Sandra pouted, with a wink back at her friend. 

 There were only two chairs in the kitchen, for just the two girls, to save room. Sandra looked at Jeff and then sat gingerly on his lap. "Hope you don't mind, kind sir," she said. 

 "Well, you two look cozy; do you want me to go?" Louise asked. 

 "Not unless you take the chair with you," Jeff smiled at her. He felt Sandra tighten her grip on his hand and knew she would remain there anyway. He tightened his grip around her waist, squeezing her playfully. 

 They didn't hear Louise's joking complaints as she left, for they were looking at each other intently. Their lips brushed gently, her eyes closed, while he fed upon her beauty hungrily. He needed to slow down, to calm down a little, his heart was racing. 

 He kissed her lips, running the tip of his tongue over them. He pulled her upper lip into his mouth and nibbled on it. He felt her wriggle her bottom on his hard cock, massaging it through his trousers. She opened her mouth, letting him enter her, and her tongue played with his, enwrapped in a passionate tangle. 

 They sucked and gasped and gripped each other with arms enwrapped about their bodies. They began to pull and tug at the clothing, caressing exposed flesh with exploring fingertips. The flat of a hand smoothed up a back, a hand gripped an arm, then moved on to unclip a bra or unzip a fly. 

 The chair fell over as she was lifted onto the kitchen table. 

 Louise heard a crash and a yelp, making her leap up out of bed. She ran to the kitchen, not knowing what to expect. In the doorway she gripped the wooden frame, as though fastened to it. For a moment she thought her friend was being assaulted, until the mutual savagery became evident. 

 She sucked on his nipples, while clawing his back. 

 He pulled her to the edge of the table. 

 They had hastily ripped off their clothes, which were scattered around the kitchen, left wherever they landed. His large penis was rigid, moving in toward her friend's pussy. Louise backed away with a hand between her legs. It was both instinctively protective and gripping her crotch with lascivious intent. She fixedly watched the hard cock invade her friend, though it felt as though she herself were being taken. 

 She stumbled back to her bedroom with her head spinning, re-running the images of lust she had just witnessed. She fell back on the bed with legs splayed, hastily pulling the crotch of her panties to one side. She began furiously rubbing her swollen lips. She wiped her bud with a finger, while pinching a nipple, as she began a long, pleasurable journey. 

 As soon as Louise left, Sandra locked her heels around his back, pulling him to her, feeling a delightful fullness. She threw her head back, moaning loudly as he picked up his pace. She realized he was taking his cue from her movements, matching her slight thrusts that were wobbling the table. 

 "Lift me up, the table will collapse," she said, through pouting lips. He held her tight in his arms, squashing her face in his chest, still thrusting with powerful legs. She remembered he had been a keen cyclist, and thanked him for it with mumbled words around a nipple. 

 "Give it to me, all of it, deeper, fuck me hard, you bastard," she wailed, in one long outpouring of a whoosh of air. 

 She sucked hard on his nipple then bit it sharply, as an orgasm hit her belly. It was like a cramp shooting out through her entire body. Both nipples swelled till they hurt. Her legs went into a spasm, digging both heels into his hard bottom. Her arms tightened around his neck and she tried to rake his back with her nails. 

 "Stop! Hold it there, don't move," she spoke harshly. 

 She heard him groan knowing it wasn't from the pain of her attack but from his orgasm. He jerked roughly; despite her clinging limbs trying to keep a hold of him, trying to keep him still. She was trying to cope with the violent sensations coursing through her over-sensitized nervous system. 

 She felt his cock jerking, knowing his powerful cock was spewing sperm into her body, imagining it strongly swimming up inside, invading her, fertilizing her, making her his woman. She yelled out a string of garbled curses, wanting to beat upon his back. She needed to tear at him, to hurt him. Unable to let go of him to use her fists, in case she fell away from his cock, a cry of frustration was ripped from her throat. 

 "Fill me up, fill me with your cum, make me yours, you bastard, don't let me go!" 

 She felt his cock subsiding from her and cried out again. "Let me squeeze it! Let me have it all!" she complained. 

 It felt like a great loss, an emptiness needing to be assuaged; she wanted to squeeze his powerful cock, needing to squeeze out every last drop of the potent force that had fired her belly. She slipped from his grasp, unable to unhook her ankles from around him, unable to move her limbs. Her nipples fired a little wave of pleasure as they ran down his chest. 

 He perched her bare bum on the edge of table, breathing heavily in her ear. The sensation tingled, as every touch of his hands and body sent little shivers through her. She felt everything in stark gut-wrenching intensity. She knew then, this man was too good to let go. She had felt it from the moment they spoke that morning, but now she knew for sure. 

 The moment of madness didn't subside into guilt or regret; she simply wanted him and would keep him. A deep sense of well-being flooded her as he carried her from the kitchen, still clinging to his body. "Left," she managed to tell him through heavy breaths. 

 They tumbled upon the bed, lying there in each other's arms, not caring about anything or anyone. He needed to sleep but managed to keep awake long enough to whisper in her ear how much he wanted her. 

 She didn't listen to the words but took in the intensity of the meaning. When his arms slackened from around her she pushed him aside, so as to look at him. She already knew she liked what she saw. He came across as a serious, almost geeky guy, someone she wouldn't have considered in the past. 

 *** 

 Louise heard her friend's gasps and howls of pleasure. Her fingers reached inside with a thumb rubbing intently upon her nub. She knew this would leave her frustrated but she had to orgasm. The sight of that man entering her friend was fixed in her mind, as though she were the woman being taken. 

 "Make love to me, be gentle with me, do it to me," she whispered, with a wispy voice. 

 The final gasps from Sandra were hers, and his lovemaking noises were in her ears, now so very sensitive. It felt as though he were here, making love to her. A slow delicious orgasm crept over her. It was deeper than expected. The orgasm took her, as though he were taking her on a lovely journey. It gently spread over her body, eventually leaving her sated. 

 "Yes! Oh! Yes! It's wonderful! You lovely man," Louise hissed, through clenched teeth. 

 *** 

 Sandra stroked his hair, kissing his fluttering closed eyes. It was her turn to murmur endearing words, unabashed at having known him for only a few intense hours. In a few moments she too was sleeping contentedly. 

 *** 

 In the morning she awoke to watch him sleeping. Propped up on an elbow, she smiled to herself, thinking over yesterday. Never had she been as forward as this, letting a man into her bedroom on a first date. Though technically it had been in the kitchen, she thought, giggling at the naughtiness of the act. 

 They had talked a lot, discovering little things about each other, but they were still strangers. She hoped the gut feeling of meeting someone different, someone good for her, wasn't wrong. 

 "Hi!" he said. 

 It took her by surprise and she smiled; a large open gesture of pleasure. 

 "You have a wonderful glint in your eyes. I think we should get to know each other a bit better, don't you?" he said, with a big teasing smile on his face. 

 Sandra liked the way he looked at her. He didn't talk to her breasts he talked to her, and he listened, too. He didn't treat her like a dumb blonde either; he considered what she said. What he did to her last night was great too. She giggled over that, having to turn away under his intense stare, as though he might read her mind. 

 "Do you do this all the time, invite strange men to your bed?" he teased. 

 From anyone else she would have been insulted and slapped them hard, but there again, someone like that wouldn't have been invited into the apartment. 

 "Yes, of course. I believe in making everyone I meet happy. Have I made you happy?" she teased, right back at him. 

 "So happy I don't think I'll let you go," he said, while grabbing hold of her head to kiss her lips.  

 

 ****** Two Blondes ****** byStoryTeller07Â© She relented, letting him explore her mouth, being passive, not wanting to start all over again just then. They needed to talk. She was pleasantly surprised that he quickly got the message, and slid back from her to lie smiling broadly at her. 

 "Do you always take women home, to seduce them on a first date?" she asked, trying to sound innocent. 

 "No." he said. Looking serious, he seemed to be questioning himself. "This is quite unusual. I can see it is for you too. What does it mean?" he asked, trying to get her to admit to something. 

 "Let's just see shall we? Have some fun, then see where it goes," she said, while fending him off. "Enough fun for the moment," she warned him. She was both relieved and disappointed he didn't push his intent. They were lying on top of the bed, uncovered, naked. She could see his interest stirring, but there were other things to do first. 

 She jumped up from the bed before he began another attack, for she was very near a full capitulation. "Make the coffee and bring them in to Louise and me. Black, no sugar," she added. She looked around the room, until remembering her clothes were in the kitchen. She looked at him with a wry grin on her face and skipped out of the bedroom. 

 Louise wasn't exactly gifted with the ability of thinking deeply, but she was another woman to be consulted. She needed an objective opinion. Sandra then remembered her friend bursting in on them last night and how she had just stood there mesmerized. Perhaps she wouldn't be able to give an objective opinion after all. 

 *** 

 "So what are you two plotting?" he asked. He watched them giggling, obviously discussing him. "Here, two coffees. Don't call me the maid, either," he warned them. 

 "I was thinking you had taken too long and I might have to spank you," Sandra teased. 

 "If you want to play that sort of game then you'll be the one spanked, young lady," he retorted. 

 "What about me?" Louise asked. "I meant, my coffee," she blushed, when they both looked at her. "Stop it you two!" she added. 

 Jeff stood looking around an untidy room, for somewhere to sit. 

 "What do you think of him?" Sandra asked. 

 "Nice," Louise said, looking up at him. 

 "What do you want me to do? Strip off for you?" he said. It was a reaction to their obvious appraisal. He flexed his arms knowing he was no muscle man. 

 "Good idea! Show my friend what I've brought home," she teased. 

 Jeff began to strip off his shirt while they hummed a tune. With two beautiful young women watching him intently, obviously amused, but also interested, he couldn't help playing up to them. His natural reserve was thrown aside with his shirt. 

 He undid his trousers expecting it to be brought to a halt by Sandra, only to discover they were both encouraging him. If he had been thinking clearly he would have realized this could only end in embarrassment. 

 In his underpants he turned around to wiggle his bottom at them. He was beginning to regret this for he wasn't exactly a young man any more and they were sure to compare him unfavorably. 

 "Very nice indeed! I'd say, built for endurance," Louise commented. 

 "Look at those calf muscles, a lot of thrusting strength there," Sandra laughed. 

 "You should know, after last night, you hussy!" Louise teased in a put-on shocked tone. 

 "You enjoyed it too, sweet," she countered. 

 "What do you mean?" Louise asked, attempting innocence. 

 "You watched us in the kitchen then ran off fingering yourself. This bed's still wet, so you must have enjoyed it too!" Sandra told her friend. 

 Jeff was amazed. Listening to the two of them was a revelation. He became carried away with the excitement of the moment. He went to the foot of the bed and lifted the quilt to attack their feet. Both girls squirmed helplessly, laughing loudly, from his tickling. They quickly set their coffee cups aside so they wouldn't scald themselves. 

 "Help! Stop! I give in," Sandra yelped, while laughing uncontrollably. 

 "Not me! Get her, she's the naughty one," Louise squeaked, through a fit of laughter. 

 He held onto an ankle stroking and scratching the sole of one foot then quickly grabbed another. As they drew their feet up the bed he followed until he was under the quilt between them. They were wearing just bras and panties, so he was surrounded by bare legs. 

 They didn't seem to be fighting him off very effectively, and it wasn't just because they were helpless in their laughter. The smooth young skin of their legs was so tempting. His hands ran up two set of thighs. They were pressed tight together as his hand skimmed over soft yielding flesh, over their panties, up to their flat bellies. 

 He blew a raspberry on one tummy then the other. 

 "Stop it, you're being naughty. I'll spank you," Sandra panted, between giggles. 

 He might have seen this as encouragement, but he was too far into the game to realize. They were enjoying it too, too excited to think about where it might end. 

 Jeff put his arms around their legs, lifting them up to make a tent under the quilt. He slapped one bottom then the other. 

 "Hey! No! Stop it!" they squealed. Even feeling weak from laughter they could have fought him off. They instead squirmed, making weak snatches at his hands, feeling helpless from their hysterics. 

 He spanked them again. Gentle slaps, more like a feel of their deliciously soft bottoms, rather than meaning to hurt. Their legs separated and his arms wound between the legs to grip them tight. All three were under the quilt now, which formed a little secret den, away from the real world. 

 Here they could play like naughty children. Both girls knew he had them in the same lock. They knew what it was doing to each of them and they liked it. The naughty game pushed each one a little further, exciting them both to a high pitch of delight. 

 Sandra could feel his arm between her legs and couldn't help gripping it tight. She refrained from rubbing her lips on his arm, but only just. She realized Louise was trying to hide her discreet movements, so she gave in, clenching his arm. She began to push her hips, humping his arm. 

 Feeling Sandra's hip rubbing back and forth it became obvious to Louise what her friend was doing. The need for gratification overwhelmed her better judgment, overwhelmed everything, as Louise, too, gripped his arm tight between her legs and rode it. 

 Jeff felt the movements and heard them breathing heavily. He looked up into their faces to see how sexed up they were. He leaned forward and bit upon Sandra's nipple through the bra. Instead of scolding him she groaned. He tried Louise and she groaned even louder. They both continued moaning and whimpering, rubbing the crotch of their panties against his arms. 

 If anything Louise was shoving the hardest, almost franticly needing to orgasm. They wore their own sex faces, a mixture of a grimace with a look of determination. He smiled to himself. Although he had calmed down, these two very hot women were desperate for an orgasm. With each of their synchronized thrusts he pulled his arm down a little further, until his hand was right between their legs. 

 He turned his hand palm down, at the same time rubbing the sodden crotch of their panties to one side. He tickled their lips, but it was obviously a waste of time, for they were open and very ready. He pushed two fingers into them until his thumb contacted their clits. 

 He rubbed with his thumb causing them to whimper in unison. He waggled his fingers bringing forth a yell, no longer of frustration but of an announcement. They were close, very close. They lay back next to each other, each one's excitement bringing the other closer and closer to completion. 

 Like glove puppets, he worked them, eliciting little yells and squirms of their hips, finding out which movements made them the most excited. Working hard upon their clits they suddenly became silent and still. As one, both young women arched their backs, trying to suck in his fingers, gripping them hard. 

 Sandra became coherent enough to shout out loud. "Stop, now, stop, hold it in," she told him. 

 "Yes, yes, yes, Oh! Yes!" Louise whimpered. 

 Sandra gripped his hand hard, almost breaking his wrist. Louise slumped down in exhaustion with her arms flopping at her sides, her legs slackly open. She fell onto his thumb which poked into her asshole. He gently extracted it but she didn't seem to care or notice. 

 He pushed his way up the bed between them, and pulled an arm from each of them around him. He had a big smile on his face from having two beautiful young women cuddling him. They didn't need encouragement to wrap their arms around him to hold on tight, snuggling up to him. 

 There was no way he was going to sleep now, for he was in heaven. A large pair of breasts was pressed against his chest, with another in his back. Both women were pressed tight against him sandwiching him between them. 

 Sandra began kissing his lips, forcing her way into his mouth. Louise kissed his back, moving up to his neck, licking and nuzzling along the way. He felt their hands over his body. Louise moved her legs away to reach his bottom. She was searching between his legs for his cock but Sandra had a firm grip of it. 

 Louise found his asshole and began circling it with a wet finger, made so from her own juices. Sandra was tugging on his cock, ever so slowly, then every so often gripped its base tightly. Louise pushed a finger into his asshole, almost causing him to cum, but a tight grip on his cock held him back. 

 Another hand began to cup his balls. With tremendous willpower, he brought his thoughts away from them, to concentrate on an analysis he was working on in the office. Again and again he lost the battle but returned to the office in his thoughts. 

 Sandra dragged him onto her body and maneuvered his cock while thrusting up at him. She took him all in with one great shove from her hips. A great yell announced her orgasm. "Fuck! Oh Shit! You fucking bastard!" she yelled. 

 The sound of her friend's orgasm rocked Louise, bringing her so close, but she could not climax again without being filled. "Please fuck me, please fuck me!" she yelped. 

 Louise was frantic, plucking at him without much strength. He knew what she wanted and rolled onto her, falling right between her legs. His cock was trapped between them pressing into her belly. She frantically maneuvered herself while he lifted up his body. He plunged in the wet open hole that was so desperately waiting for him. 

 It seemed to grasp him tight, closing hard around his aching cock. He had been waiting too long; his climax would not be imminent. He knew he was going to have to work hard to get his release, and he thrust into her, again and again, fucking her with a passion. 

 Louise whimpered from a deep orgasm. "Thank you, oh, thank you," she whispered. He carried on pounding at her pussy, thrusting in with a cock that demanded satisfaction. Eventually he spurted into her inert body. A long satisfying pumping of jet after jet of sperm spurted into her. 

 Louise's whole body shuddered from another orgasm. He collapsed between them, sated. He vaguely felt hands exploring his body, not knowing whose they were, and not caring, for he was in heaven again. 

 He fell asleep looking resplendent, with a smile on his face. 

 Sandra put her head on his chest listening to his heart still beating heavily. She looked at her friend trying to recover from a deep climax. 

 Louise looked away from her friend, not knowing what to say. 

 "What do you think of our stud, then? Good or magnificent, don't you think?" Sandra whispered. 

 Did she say, 'our stud', Louise wondered. Did she really mean that or was she ready for a fight? "He's wonderful. You're lucky," she said, still not daring to look at her friend. 

 "If you're good, I might share him with you," she smiled. 

 Louise looked at her, trying to fathom whether she meant it. Would she mean it once they returned to reality from this dream world of bliss? 

 "We haven't had boyfriends for a long time. You remember all those evenings alone sharing a bottle of wine? We talked about where we were going wrong. This one is pretty good, don't you think?" 

 Louise nodded her head. She wasn't sure about sharing him, could that work? They whispered together, although it didn't look as though he would wake for a week, or even for an earthquake. 

 "Give him a nice kiss," Sandra said. 

 Feeling unsure, even guilty, she tenderly kissed his lips. Sandra watched closely with a big warm smile lighting her face. Louise was surprised to see Sandra looked contented, even though she was kissing her man. 

 They slipped out of the bed to shower and pull on dressing gowns. 

 *** 

 "Hey sleepyhead, coffee," Sandra said. Sitting on the edge of Louise's bed she prodded Jeff, unable to wait any longer. He made the usual grunting sounds that might mean something in a prehistoric language, sat up and began sipping the hot coffee. 

 Sandra didn't want to torture him with silence, though it was difficult to know where to begin. He was studying the coffee, avoiding looking at her, trying to think of what to say, how to apologize. He looked guilty, which was a good sign. Although she was always a sensible person, this time she started in the middle and worked her way outwards. 

 "It's difficult to meet a nice guy. We go to a club, and it's the bold immature guy who gets sent over by his friends. Nice guys seem afraid to approach us, or they dismiss us, thinking we're just dumb blondes," Sandra quietly spoke, treading carefully. 

 "We haven't brought anyone home in a long time. We don't do this sort of thing. You're special, Jeff," she took a deep breath. "I want to get to know you," she said. 

 He took her hand and squeezed it. "How's Louise, she alright?" Sandra smiled, nodding her head. "I want to get to know you, too. We'll take it slow as you said." He hesitated, not wanting to mention what happened. 

 "Do we forget what happened here?" he asked. He really meant to say that they must, but it came out wrong. He needed her guidance on how to approach Louise. 

 "No. We're both OK. It's up to you." 

 "I don't understand," he said. He could at least look at her now. "I want to get to know you, to get over this awkward start," he said, treading carefully. 

 "OK. We were thinking maybe you might want to get to know both of us," she said, lightly blushing. Looking away, she wondered what the hell he was thinking of her. "Do you think you could? I mean, it's difficult. I'm usually clear what I mean. This is unusual but could you handle getting to know both of us?" Sandra said. 

 She felt embarrassed. The two friends had talked it through and it seemed a reasonable arrangement, until now confronting him with it. She looked away again, unsure of herself. 

 "I'm not sure it would work. You've talked it through? You're way ahead of me. I need time to think about it," he muttered. 

 Sandra laughed. "You look shocked," she said. "Any guy would jump at the chance. I knew you would be cautious. I told Louise you were a perfect man, a one in a million. We don't want to let you go, Jeff," she said, with a determined voice, showing she meant it. 

 The silence was too much for her. "We would never contemplate such an arrangement with anyone else," she added. 

 "I know," he sighed. He was trying to be reassuring but he hardly knew her. "What did you discuss? What do I do?" he said, sounding bewildered. 

 "We go out separately, on dates. At home we kind of share things," she said. Sandra was feeling more confident now. She was afraid he might think they were a couple of sluts but he looked concerned and was handling it well. 

 "At least we got over the first kiss," he smiled at her. "I need a hug," he said. 

 She wrapped her arms around him and held on tightly. 

 "This is a bit of a shock. I need a shower. I'll go talk to Louise," he mumbled. 

 Sandra nodded and reluctantly let go of him. 

 *** 

 "Louise, you alright?" Jeff asked. 

 "Sure! You OK?" she asked. She smiled at him nervously. 

 "We don't do that sort of thing, you know," she said, trying to sound sensible and mature about it. "Well. It was nice," she blushed. 

 "OK. Where do we go from here?" he asked. 

 "Sandra thinks you can ... look after us both?" she blushed even more. 

 "I'm willing to give it a try, if you are," he said. She nodded and smiled at him. "It's funny. I should feel on top of the world, but I'm nervous," he sighed. He sat next to her and put an arm around her. She wrapped both arms around him and they hugged, not speaking. 

 In the shower he had worked out that Sandra was the bold one, a 'take life in both hands' kind of person, whereas Louise was the opposite. She needed caring for, looking after. But, didn't everyone when it came down to it? 

 "We all need someone to care for us and I have plenty of love to share. I want to share some time with you, Louise," he held her face in his hands, looking directly into her eyes. 

 "That would be nice," she cooed. 

 She was nineteen but looked much younger right then. He felt his years melting away, as though he were a vigorous youth again. "So! Where do we begin?" he asked. 

 "You hungry?" she asked. "I can make something to eat. What do you like?" she asked with eagerness. 

 He was over the shock, coming to terms with it all, but he didn't think it the right time to say he wanted to eat her pussy. "Let's get together in the kitchen and see what there is," he told her. 

 The awkwardness evaporated as the two friends orchestrated a late breakfast. They had settled things between them and were pleased he had agreed to their idea. He sat there watching them. 

 Two beautiful young blondes were cooking breakfast for him. He didn't usually have a dessert after breakfast, but their giggles and the looks they gave him warned him to eat a hearty meal. He reckoned he would need all the strength he could muster today.  

 

 ****** Two Blondes Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Jeff kept smiling to himself. His arm had a couple of bruises where he had pinched it. He tried to show the two girls he was cool with the idea of sharing their lives, and that he could handle it. 'Just see where it goes' Sandra had told him. This had been Sandra's idea and Louise, the younger of the two, went along with it. So far it had gone very well, for him, and they looked happy enough. It was going so damn well, he was on a constant high, trying to calm down. 

 Every time he looked at them he wanted to punch the air and shout out loud. He was thirty-two and kept slim from working out, though he didn't consider himself a muscular hunk. Sandra was mature for her age at twenty-two yet her youthfulness often showed. So how had it happened that he was getting to know two attractive young blondes? 

 Jeff had never been attracted to beautiful women, thinking they were vain and selfish, yet Sandra had surprised him. She looked like a dumb blonde though she turned out to be witty, intelligent and clearly knew what she wanted out of life. 

 At the moment it seemed he was the one she wanted. 

 Louise was almost identical to her in looks â an attractive, big busted blonde. Why she had been included into their relationship was still a mystery to him. Was he complaining, - No! It worried him that it could all go badly wrong; meanwhile he was enjoying himself. 

 Sandra was feeling pleased with herself. She had been right about Jeff, he was a nice considerate man, unlike the two selfish boyfriends they had some time ago. He was twice the man they were, and thinking that had given her the idea. The two women had talked about how difficult it was to meet a nice considerate guy, only to end up sharing a bottle of wine during another boring night in. 

 When she mentioned sharing him, Louise was rightly doubtful, saying it couldn't possibly work. There was a glint in her eye that betrayed her, though. Sandra remembered her friend watching them make love that first night and how visibly aroused she had been. Sandra could see Louise considering it. So how was she to convince her to give it a try? There were so many pitfalls that could spoil things, not only the beginning of her relationship with Jeff, but the long time relationship with Louise, too. 

 When she had teased Jeff this morning, Louise played along, though neither expected anything to happen. Sandra encouraged them both until he started tickling their feet and crawled into the bottom of the bed. He hadn't blatantly tried it on with either of them, just played around, tickling and teasing them. 

 

 The teasing progressed, with Louise becoming so turned on she couldn't refuse him. Like her, Louise hadn't had a man in a long time, so maybe that explained it. Sandra didn't have to push him onto her, as he too was carried away in the heat of the moment. 

 She had to admit it was exciting watching them. Her man was taking her and her friend too! It turned her on so much, she unexpectedly loved it. Only then did she really know it could work. After their love making session, Louise was convinced too, so they discussed it and set some rules. 

 *** 

 "Are you sure you want to come shopping with us?" Sandra asked, with a light tinkling laugh. 

 "I want to get to know you both. What you eat, what makes you laugh, everything. Well, maybe not everything," he smiled. Jeff didn't want them to think he was obsessive. He was a business analyst, so he was halfway there already. This was his chance to start living life to the full again, with these two young women knocking the stuffiness out of him. 

 "OK! You're on!" Sandra stated, thinking this wouldn't last long. Men shopping! What next, picking the right clothes to go out in? It didn't matter if they were fathers or boyfriends, they always came up with the same excuse - they were comfortable. 

 "First, I need to stop off and get changed," he told them. 

 Sandra and Louise couldn't wait to see his apartment. It was a loft in an old brick warehouse, in a trendy part of town. He was aware of their scrutiny, with eyes wandering all over the lounge as though painting every inch. 

 "Take a look around. Records and DVD's over there, bathrooms there and there, my room, two spare rooms through there," he said, with arms wind-milling like a stewardess demonstrating the safety routine. They were both too busy to notice his attempt at humor. 

 As soon as he went into the bathroom they started the search. Nothing was said, they just got down to scrutinizing the place for evidence, like a well honed forensic team. Emerging from a bathroom, Louise looked at her friend with a nod and a quizzical look. Sandra nodded back with a smile on her face. Obviously a woman hadn't been in the apartment for some time. 

 He wasn't fussy about storing his music or films, didn't cook much and didn't have any infectious ailments. At least there were no ointments or pills in the bathroom. The two young women sidled into his bedroom. 

 "Nice," they said, in unison. 

 "I've not decided yet!" he complained. As a joke he pulled out a Hawaiian shirt. "What do you think?" he asked, looking seriously at it. 

 "We had better dress you," Sandra simply stated. 

 Louise laughed, though she was the first to his wardrobe, so she had taken it seriously. Sandra went through the drawers, while he stood there looking from one to the other. 

 "I thought I was the dominant one in the bedroom," he proffered. They were concentrating so much, he thought it was just a throwaway statement. 

 "You are, you are the master, of course," Sandra answered him. 

 He knew that was a sop to keep him quiet. "So, you two are going to do as you are told," he stated, though it came out as a question. 

 "Of course we are, you're our man aren't you?" Sandra replied, still taking no notice of him. 

 They laid out two sets of clothes on the bed and stood back expecting him to decide and get dressed. Noticing the underwear, he felt embarrassed in just a towel, for they were staring at him, waiting. "Well?" he asked. 

 "We've seen all you've got, so don't be shy," Sandra said. She arched her eyebrow, meaning to challenge him. 

 "I meant, I'm the boss in the bedroom," he said, with a mock stern voice. 

 Louise giggled. She was watching him closely, with eyes darting down to his crotch, becoming aware of what she was doing, so looking away again, repeating the process again and again. 

 "OK. The boss wants a hug," he demanded. To his surprise they grabbed hold of him, pressing their bodies tight up against him. Sandra pressed her belly against his hard cock with Louise pressing against his bottom. Their arms were entwined around his body, both of them breathing as heavily as he was. Damn! They were as aroused as he was! 

 Somehow they managed to shuffle toward the bed, without breaking off touching and fondling each other, to fall in a heap onto it. The two young blondes held onto him as he tried to get free. He wanted to touch them, of course. 

 "No! It's our turn," Sandra scolded him, breathing heavily over him. 

 Jeff stopped struggling, catching onto her meaning straight away. Louise fell to his side, not understanding. 

 "Kiss him," Sandra ordered her friend. She worked her way down his body with hot kisses, more light and breathy than substantial. The towel was lost somewhere on the floor. 

 Jeff lay there feeling Sandra's hot breath on his belly, inches from his throbbing cock. He watched Louise leaning over him with hooded eyes from a growing passion. She was watching her friend. Her pouting full lips were close to his and though he wanted to reach up to kiss them, he instead was too fascinated watching her face change. The enthralling expression of lust was growing, turning to a deep intensity. 

 He felt Sandra's cheek nudge his cock, as she licked and kissed his belly. She flicked her tongue over the bulb of his cock, making it jerk in response. It seemed to enthrall Louise, exciting her all the more. He felt Sandra suck on the end of his cock. Louise couldn't take it any longer. She plunged her lips onto his mouth, sucking his tongue into her mouth. She was desperately working his tongue, as though it were a penis, penetrating her. 

 He was aware that the two young women were satisfying themselves on his body, with their hands grabbing him, stroking him. Sandra was in control, sucking his cock, slowly drawing it in. He wanted to shove at her face with his hips, but instead, he lay there unable to move, letting them make use of his body. Somehow he didn't orgasm there and then. 

 Sandra let go of him with her mouth, still gripping his cock with a hand tightly wrapped around its base. She pulled on her friend's arm. "Your turn," she said. Louise was carried away in lust so she had to be guided to his cock. "Grip it here," Sandra told her. 

 Louise's eyes opened wide on seeing his cock so close to her open mouth. She looked at her friend as though asking for permission then sucked on it with big wet lips. She hadn't ever wanted to do this before, though now, she was so carried away, she dove on it, choking herself when it hit the back of her throat. 

 "Grip it hard, hold him back," Sandra warned her. 

 A small thought wended its way through his mind, that it was fright that held him off from a tremendous orgasm. Two gorgeous women were using his body, taking turns on sucking him, how else was it possible he hadn't cum already? The fear of letting them down kept him objective, thinking, rather than letting go. 

 Sandra kissed him lightly on the lips. He absorbed the smile on her face, seeing it as pleasure, rather than the lust her friend was caught up in. He was aware of the inexpert sucking Louise was giving his rock hard cock, compared to Sandra's steady light touch. Nevertheless, it was terrifically satisfying. Had he died and gone to heaven it couldn't get any better than this. 

 "What is she doing to you? Tell me," Sandra demanded. 

 He opened his mouth finding he couldn't speak, so maybe he wasn't in control after all. 

 "Tell me," she breathed lightly in his ear. 

 "She's sucking my cock," he managed to whisper. 

 "Who is?" she asked. 

 "Louise, she's sucking on my cock," he groaned. "Your best friend is sucking my cock," he relented. 

 "Is she doing a god job?" she teased. 

 "Not as good as you. She's slobbering all over it, licking up its length," he moaned, on feeling Louise again sucking it into her mouth. Sandra was still breathing into his ear, with a fingernail tracing his face, stroking him, occasionally kissing his nipples. 

 "She's playing with my balls," he moaned out loud. 

 When he moaned a different tune, on an inward breath, she had to have him tell her. "What is she doing to you now?" she asked with a husky breath. 

 "She's running a fingernail around my asshole," he managed to whisper back. 

 Sandra licked his nipples and sucked on them. Pleased to hear him groaning and squirming under her. She locked her legs around one of his, rubbing herself against him. 

 "What else is she doing to you," she asked, now breathing as heavily as him. 

 "She's holding it tight," he murmured. "I can't cum, I want to, don't want to," he said in confusion. 

 "Not yet, my lovely man, save it. Save your lovely cum for me," she told him. 

 At last he realized what she was doing to him. She was getting him to hold back, to make the delicious sensations last. It was frustrating, yet he did want the feeling of being on top of the world to last. 

 Sandra glanced down to her friend, seeing her playing with herself in frustration. She was still dressed, but she found a way into her panties, fingering her pussy rapidly. With a sigh Sandra realized Louise's need was greater than her own. 

 "Stop now, get up," she told Louise. Guiding her to a sitting position, on top of Jeff, her friend needed little encouragement. 

 Louise almost ripped the crotch of her panties in her haste. She moved on top of his cock, rubbed it over her wet lips, and pushed. 

 "Go for it, lovely man. Fuck Louise hard," Sandra whispered, in his ear. She watched him thrust hard with his hips lifting off the bed. He was now released from the spell she had weaved over him. She kissed his lips with a tongue exploring his mouth, wrapping it around and around his tongue. 

 Jeff breathed rapidly around Sandra's tongue, sucking in air as he pushed upward, with strong hips and legs. His heels dug into the bed lifting Louise's whole body up, thrusting heavily, to penetrate her body deeply. 

 Louise couldn't move any more, she flopped around like a rag doll riding a wild pony. 

 "Harder, Jeff! Fuck her hard, fuck her deep, do it Jeff," Sandra encouraged him. 

 Louise shrieked out, hissing disconnected words. "I'm there! Yes! I'm cumming! Thank you! Oh! Thank you!" she yelped. 

 Sandra marveled at her politeness. It seemed so incongruous to her. She never became so carried away, neither did she speak during an orgasm. At least she didn't think so. 

 "Now, Jeff! Shoot loads of your lovely cum into Louise. She needs it. Fill her up with cum," she laughed in delight. 

 Jeff heard her as though it were from a far distance, as he too felt a deep orgasm. His heels drummed on the bed silently. His body stilled, feeling every drop of spurting fluid pass through the end of his cock. It felt as though it might go on forever, pumping away, spasm after spasm. 

 Sandra grabbed hold of Louise before she fell, letting her flop beside him, to snuggle close. She too snuggled up to him, watching his chest heave with deep breaths. She laid her head on his chest with a satisfied smile on her face, listening to his heart thumping hard. 

 "It's my turn tonight," she whispered, knowing they hadn't heard a word. 

 *** 

 The three of them showered, purposely keeping a clear distance so as to get the job done without the distraction naked bodies would cause. As his clothes had been knocked onto the floor and the girls hadn't undressed before bouncing on the bed, they all looked a bit disheveled leaving the apartment. 

 First, they stopped off for lunch. Fortified and feeling good, they entered a department store. "The men's department first," Sandra declared. 

 Shrugging his shoulders he gave way, as he had earlier to their passion. They fussed over him, while the assistant went back and forth, trying to keep up with their demands. The woman was keen to help for she was on commission. Jeff noticed her eyeing the three of them, trying to work out what their relationship was. 

 Sandra wanted him in a suit and Louise wanted him in casual wear, so they bought both. With extras to mix and match, they explained to him. Wearing new shoes he had to parade up and down, while they watched with animated smiles on their faces. They selected what he was to wear now and finally he was allowed to pay, marking an end to the ordeal. 

 "Do I get to choose your clothes then?" he asked. 

 "No way," they chorused. 

 He hadn't thought so. They muttered with heads together on the way to the department and he wondered what they were up to. 

 "OK!" Sandra smiled. "When we've finished you can choose an outfit for us," she smirked. "We probably won't be able to wear it outside the apartment, but you can choose," she said. 

 They both laughed that teasing, tinkling sound he had grown to like. So they expected him to select something awful or lewd or what, exactly? He figured he had plenty of time to think about it while they searched the racks of clothes, for this department was twice the size of the menswear section. 

 He was right. They seemed to be examining every article of clothing on every rack. He took a seat, probably there for this very reason. It wasn't such a chore for they often called him over for an opinion, which he was too clever to answer. They came out of the changing cubicle on a regular basis to twirl a skirt or show off a blouse. They could show off a top so well he didn't mind one bit. 

 Each of them took a turn wearing a too tight top, to tease him with their ample breasts. The top was obviously rejected afterwards. At least here they were left alone to get on with it, without an assistant slowing them down. He wanted to join them in the changing room but was told-off, with giggles of delight. 

 "That could be one of my choices," he grinned. Louise was wearing a top almost revealing her nipples. He was sure just a little adjustment could have them out on show. 

 She giggled at him while thrusting out her boobs. "Later," she said, with an encouraging smile. 

 He was getting an idea as to what he was supposed to be selecting for them, as Sandra was obviously behind the naughty teasing. Even without these distractions it was a pleasure to watch them emerge from the changing room, showing off such a voluptuous shape. 

 A woman emerged from the changing room giving him a serious scowl. It was touch and go whether she called security for a moment, until they came out to show off their latest discoveries. She had probably thought he was hanging around leering at the women. A knowing look crossed her face and she even smiled at him. Poor guy, she evidently thought, on realizing why he was so excited. 

 He fought with them to gain the privilege of paying, but lost the battle. The cashier looked at them with an impatient look while they argued and jousted with credit cards drawn. He at least knew they weren't after him for his money, but then again, so what if they were. 

 He helped with the bags, hoping some of the stuff would have been his choice anyway. It was impossible to tell what looked good dangling from a hanger, yet they seemed to manage fine. 

 Half way to the exit he stopped. "Hey! I thought I was going to pick something!" he complained. 

 "You are, darling man, you are," Sandra replied. They put a hand to his ass, holding a cheek each, guiding him out of the store. 

 "Where are we going? Not more shoes I hope!" he complained. Clip clopping on new heels that echoed through the mall, they carried right on into a store, with him following. Jeff's eyes started to focus on the bright clothes, realizing they were flimsy pieces of silk meant to be underwear. 

 His first reaction was to look away. They pulled him in with arms wrapped through his. Now that he was looking he couldn't look away. His eyes swiveled around for a moment until seeing an assistant weighing them up. He looked away in embarrassment. 

 "I've never dared go in here before," Louise whispered, to Sandra. 

 "There's nothing here obscene, although it depends on how you look at things, I guess," she smiled at her friend, and winked broadly. "I guess we could choose for you, unless you want us to model them. You wouldn't have to even nod, we'd know from your reaction," Sandra teased. 

 Jeff had never dared to enter such a store, either. He decided to get a grip and show them he wasn't going to be outmaneuvered again. He was their man and would make his own decisions. The assistant came over to them with a big smile. She was glamorous and confident, in her thirties like Jeff, which only made him more uncomfortable. 

 "My name is Margaret. What can I help you with today," she asked, with a clipped accent directed at Sandra. She had dismissed Jeff as a useless male and Louise looked too young. 

 "It's our lovely man here, he wants to buy us each something special," Sandra said. She put a soft girly tone to her voice and giggled. Putting a hand to her mouth, acting coy and cute, was going way over the top. The woman had been looking at her, dismissing the other two, so she missed the look of surprise on their faces. 

 Jeff and Louise brought their near laughter under control before it broke out. Louise was used to Sandra's games, when she wanted to shake someone up. She obviously didn't like the woman's snooty attitude. It was easy for Louise to follow the performance for she was close to sounding like a dumb blonde anyway. 

  

 

 ****** Two Blondes Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© "It's his choice, something nice and frilly," Louise stated, and giggled too. 

 "Our lovely man wants to buy us some treats, something naughty to wear for him," Sandra added. 

 Jeff had to give her points for a perfect recovery. Like a praying mantis her head swiveled to look directly at him. She forced a smile looking as though she wanted to look him up and down but didn't. 

 "What does, Sir, have in mind?" she asked. She used the word, 'sir', with a sneer. 

 Jeff looked around the store hoping for inspiration. With her attitude it was no wonder the place was empty, for who would want to come back to be patronized. "As my lovely girls said. I want something naughty for them to wear tonight. Something, frilly, girly and naughty for my two little pets," he said. 

 

 Only because of her pomposity was he able to keep a straight face. Jeff dare not look at the woman or at the two young women, still holding onto his arms. He just hoped they wouldn't kill him outside, after such a demeaning speech. He felt them squeeze his arm and felt relieved. 

 "That sounds gorgeous," Sandra gushed. 

 The woman hesitated, obviously preferring something more tangible to go on. This time she gave the two girls a professional once over making a mental note of their sizes and styles. "Let's start with a dress, then perhaps we can move on to underwear to match?" she asked. 

 "That sounds like a good plan," Jeff conceded. He was grateful, for it let him off the hook, as where in hell would he start? 

 Once they got going the woman began to thaw. Jeff guessed they had given the woman a better indication of what he wanted than he ever could. Leaving it to them wasn't disappointing after all. The two girls came out wearing a sheath. It probably had a complicated name, but that was all it was. 

 It clung to their voluptuous bodies, tightly fitting between their breasts, holding them up and apart as though they were being cupped in his hands. A masterpiece of engineering, he thought. When they turned around their bottoms were similarly held firmly. The dresses were short enough to be a problem bending down, and anything other than standing still, would cause a stir amongst even the dead. 

 "I think we are on to a winner with this little number," the woman commented. She had taken one look at Jeff to make a positive judgement. 

 All Jeff could do was nod, giving no thought to practical issues, like where they could be seen in public, without being arrested. 

 "The clever part is the underwear. It can't be seen, yet carried out its job perfectly," she said. 

 Jeff realized she was talking to him now; the girls had disappeared into the changing room. This was a change in attitude. She was smiling and teasing him. She turned back to the changing room to help the girls, not expecting a reply. He looked a little shell-shocked already, and it looked as though they were preparing another attack upon his senses. 

 Each came out as though expecting a drum roll. The light in his eyes didn't disappoint them. Louise wore a red dress and Sandra a classic black dress, though both were of the same design. They gave a twirl, for the short, light hem to rise up. They were wearing red and black stockings matching their outfits. 

 "Do you like the garter belt or do you prefer the stay-ups?" Margaret asked. She was warming to the infectious fun the girls generated between them. 

 On cue the girls lifted the dresses, showing off red and black panties, framed by belts biting their white thighs. The panties were tight and see-through over their lips. The thin belts pulled at the sheer stockings clinging to their legs. Again he nodded, unable to speak. A big grin overtook his face and he tried not to look too manic. 

 The girls ran back to the changing room with excited squeals of pleasure. "Underwear is an important foundation for all garments. We should take our time selecting them, don't you think?" Margaret asked him. 

 This time he was ready for her parting comment. "Yes, I agree," he replied. He didn't agree though. He just wanted to rush home and ravish them both. Well, he could wait and it would give him a chance to cool down. He wasn't sure if he could even drive in a straight line at the moment, as all he could see was their beautiful young bodies, decked out in flimsy underwear, seared into his retina. 

 Jeff could hear the buzz of conversation, impatiently wondering how much longer they would be. At last the curtains were drawn apart once again. They appeared, with nervous giggles, wearing corsets. They had been stringing up the backs of the tight corsets while he thought they were fussing over bra and panty sets. 

 Again Sandra wore black and Louise wore a lascivious red. Jeff almost swore out loud. Even Margaret laughed at his reaction. Though their waists were slim, the tight corsets pulled them in tight, pushing up their breasts into a deep cleavage. They were perched on what looked like a shelf of silk, with nipples pointing at him. Jeff had seen their large breast before but like this they looked massive. Surely he could be forgiven for staring bug-eyed at them. 

 They quickly turned to scamper into the changing room, leaving him with a view of their bare bottoms, with just a ribbon of silk hidden between their cheeks. He hadn't even noticed the stockings and suspenders until then. 

 Margaret looked at him keenly. "A difficult choice, sir," she smiled. She looked at him with a canny yet wistful expression. Instead of turning quickly to help the girls she smiled at him, looking embarrassed. "I'm sure you will enjoy the outfit, whichever you choose," she said, with a catch in her throat. She flushed pink, adding to the look of embarrassment, and quickly scurried off. 

 Jeff wondered what they had been telling her. If he weren't mistaken, she looked aroused. She was right. It was truly a difficult choice. So it was up to him after all. His face clouded then lit up with an idea. He didn't have to ask how much or decide which one; he decided to take the lot. 

 They teased him that there were other things too, but wouldn't say; they just shared knowing looks. Margaret was busy packing bags of treats, as well as being included in the secret looks and winks between the girls. She flushed again, a deeper red this time. 

 They were given smiles and well wishes now, rather than disdainful frowns. Jeff didn't think it had anything to do with the commission she had earned, either. 

 "What did you tell her, about us?" he asked, once outside. The two girls giggled together but wouldn't reveal anything. 

 "Just girl talk, that's all. Are you happy with your presents?" they asked, and again started giggling. 

 On the drive back they chatted to themselves in the back of the car. He thought he heard Louise say, "I thought that woman was going to ask if she could join in." He could have been mistaken or gotten the wrong idea, though. Sandra changed the subject over to what they were going to cook tonight. 

 "I thought we should go out tonight, celebrate maybe," Jeff suggested. 

 "In the things you just bought?" Sandra asked. 

 "No way!" Louise squealed, with a wicked laugh. 

 "We are cooking our master a meal tonight. Like the good little pets we are," she laughed. "Then our master can enjoy the presents he bought for his cute little pets," Sandra added. Again she put on the cute little voice used in the store. 

 This time, though, he was the one being teased. He hadn't given it much thought, calling them his pets, but it seemed they weren't going to let him forget it. He liked the idea of them dressing up for him; after all, the presents were for him to enjoy. 

 In the mirror the girls watched the smile on his face grow to an enormous grin. They suspected he was growing something else too, especially for them to enjoy. Report_Story
