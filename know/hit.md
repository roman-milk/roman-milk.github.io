(No BDSM yet but be patient. Things will develop.) 

* 

Josie lounged at a small round table in a corner of the bar with a beer and shot. Her attitude didn't invite company yet after a few drinks the arrogant or stupid would inevitably make a try. Dressed in tight jeans and t-shirt her slim figure was attraction enough. 

The long black silken hair framed an attractive face which had been spoiled by a grimace too often held. Early in the evening the inexperienced would fancy their chances and later a cheap guy would think he didn't have to buy her many drinks. The early ones couldn't handle the put-downs and later they were disappointed to find she could hold her drink. 

A tall muscular young man came to stand by her chair was full of natural athletic confidence and only partly full of drink. "Do you wanna dance?" he offered. 

"No!" Josie stated plainly. The word wasn't needed for the look of disdain she flashed him was enough. 

Unused to being put down in front of his buddies he reached down with a hand under her arm pulling her out of the chair. "I can teach you some moves, babe," he said with a big stupid grin on his face that was supposed to be a winsome smile full of charm 

He doubled up in pain and sank to the floor. "That's a move you weren't expecting eh?" she smile. Josie looked at him with a boot poised to kick him in a kidney if he moved too quickly. A large hand gripped her shoulder. 

"That's enough," Pete said. He pulled the guy to his feet and shoved him away. "Go home and take your friends with you," he said. The voice hadn't been raised but one look at who it was sent them scuttling off. 

"I don't need your protection. I can look after myself," Josie flatly stated with the usual grimace on her face. 

"I can see that. I need him for a job in the morning," Pete said, looking her over. "Sit down," he told her. 

She was half way down into the wooden bar chair anyway. It was difficult to rise again without looking stupid so she leaned back in the chair looking straight at him with a challenging look. Keep my interest or move on was just one of the messages being shoved across the table. 

"Where did you learn that move? One finger in the solar plexus to a guy like that is impressive," Pete said quietly. 

"The marines," she stated, with a crooked smile that added to her beauty. The way she had spat the words spilt an uncomfortable feeling on the table between them. 

"You weren't in the marines," he said, challenging her in turn. 

"My father was," she said, this time looking away into the distance. 

"Mine too. Taught me discipline and not to look for trouble," he said, leaving the statement open. She looked back at him obviously taking the point. 

"Are you trouble mister?" she said, with contempt in her voice and a grin that merely turned up a corner of the mouth. 

A silence descended on the awkward conversation as a round of drinks was delivered by a waitress. She studiously ignored them without the false formalities of earning a tip. 

"Sitting in this bar drinking alone isn't the way to avoid trouble," he told her. 

"Who says I'm into avoiding trouble," she threw back at him. 

"What did your father do besides teach you to fight?" he asked. His curiosity had been aroused by her attitude as well as the tight fit of her jeans. 

"We used to wrestle on the floor until he got me into a helpless hold. He always won eventually. Sometimes he got some of the guys from the platoon to try and take me. Sometimes I won," she looked back at him with head up, eyes narrowed, expecting something in return. 

He looked at the small breasts with nipples hardening under the tight t-shirt. "A hard case I take it. You enjoyed it though, win or lose," he stated. 

Josie gave him a hard look frowning fiercely. Scrutinising his face she found no sign of pathetic sympathy or sordid innuendo. A statement of fact had been offered. She relaxed a little and swallowed the biting rough whisky. 

He was in his early forties. He was a handsome rough working man, not a pretty boy who would be more interested in himself than her. An eye tooth was the only thing missing, for he had all is hair and plenty of muscle, all of it from hard work rather than working out. 

She was twenty four and attractive but no magazine model. Not tall but slim, except for a belly that would blossom if she ate regular and small hard breasts with a butt to match. She sat with legs apart as though to say here it is come and get it if you dare. 

She leaned forward with an amused look on her face. "Do you want to fuck me Pete?" 

*** 

In the old fashioned motel room Josie pulled her panties off, dropped them on the floor and lay back on the bed, not bothering to remove the t-shirt. He too had simply dropped his pants on the floor. 

His breathing became ragged and gasping but at the last moment he held back. With his cock still inside he lifted himself on large rough hands to look into her face. It was difficult to make out the expression with light from the blinds slatted across her face. 

"You're not enjoying this," he stated. 

"I'm not drunk enough. Don't tell me you're a gentleman wanting the lady to cum first. Carry on. Get it over with," she told him. The restrained emotion didn't hide the disappointment in her voice. 

He reluctantly pulled himself from her and rolled over to face the ceiling. "It needs more than a good paint job," he said seriously. 

"Who are you Pete?" she asked. It had been a long time, if ever, that she had been interested in someone. 

"I had a good local hardware store until that damn chain moved into town. I lost the business and my wife too. She ran off with the area manager. Don't think she meant it to spite me. He had a nice big regular pay cheque on offer." Leaning over the edge of the bed he fumbled in his jeans. "Here," he said. 

She didn't want to see a sad family picture from his wallet and was surprised when he dropped a few crumpled bills on her tummy. "What's this?" 

"Isn't that the rate for a whore to listen to cheerless stories?" He rolled off the bed in time to miss the elbow punch. It crumpled the pillow instead of his face. Landing on his back he caught her as she leaped on him. He managed to grip her arms before she could strike out and supported her torso with bent knees. 

He kicked away her legs each time she tried to kick him. She tried to head-butt him and missed as he held her away. She wriggled and cursed trying to get a hold on him. 

He pulled her close, still gripping her arms, to suck a whole breast into his mouth. It was small and firm and he could feel the nipple growing hard from the sucking and biting. 

No longer kicking out she breathed heavily from the exertion and his attention, though he knew it was something more than this. Feeling the heat of her body against his was a sensation remembered from a long time ago when sex was fun, not just a married mans duty. 

She still held her body stiff as though waiting a chance to hurt him but he decided to take a chance. Without warning he lifted her up and slid her onto his cock. Her slight frame held enough weight to push her down its length embedding him deep inside her body. 

"You bastard!" she breathed out in a breathy whisper. Nevertheless she pulled her legs around almost kicking his face. She began to ride him pushing down hard with every stroke. She fucked herself on him using his cock like a wild thing as though still fighting. 

An angry outburst of harsh abuse rattled from between her clenched teeth and he felt an orgasm being shaken from her body. As she deflated against him he used her in turn. He quickly cum but the ride was satisfying. 

*** 

There were no goodbyes. They got dressed absorbed in their own thoughts working out what had happened, not why, so it could be fitted into what to do next. An awkward hand shake turned into a shoulder press style of an even more awkward hug. 

Josie left first shuffling her feet, the only sign she was reluctant to leave, nevertheless, not glancing back. Not even on the drive out of town did she pause but carried on eating up the road. Breakfast like any other meal could be snatched from a gas station on the way to somewhere else. 

*** 

Josie knocked on the door of an ordinary suburban home. It was late at night and she was half hoping he would be out, but somehow knew he would be there. With a start she realised the door had opened and he was standing staring at her. 

She didn't know what to say, couldn't express what she felt. She hardly knew why she was there. 

"You had better come in," Pete told her. He just turned and walked through the lounge into the kitchen leaving her to stumble in the darkened interior of an unfamiliar house. 

The kitchen light was switched on buzzing, not loud enough to drown the sound of crickets busy attracting a partner. It blinded her for a moment and so was caught unawares again after adjusting found him standing close, examining her. 

"Who gave you that?" he asked, referring to a shiny blue eye. 

"You should have seen the other guy," she shrugged. 

"I told you to watch out for yourself," he said, admonishing her. 

The concern in his voice was obvious, enough to thaw her, just enough to accept a glistening chrome chair. She hadn't decided to stay though. Looking around the kitchen it looked as though she had stepped into a show-home from the sixties. Sparkling clean chrome and green Formica predominated. 

"I like it," he said, noticing the scrutiny. 

Rattled from having driven all yesterday, then driven almost straight back through the night she missed his meaning. She ignored him a moment, clearing the droning road noise from her head wondering if this had been the right direction. 

"So, tell me," he said. 

It wasn't exactly a welcoming enquiry as to how she was and with his back to her fixing a drink it would have been rude from anyone else. 

"I drove some place and stopped in a bar to enquire about a motel," she stated, as though it were a report to a concerned parent. 

"I got run out of town," she said, trying to sound impressed with her own importance. It had just made her feel the powers of female attraction were failing. A pair of tight jeans with a tighter t-shirt usually succeeded in minimising a bar fight, but not this time. 

Bar trouble didn't usually result in unpleasant advice from the law. It was a humbling and sobering experience when a local cop told her to drive and not come back. 

"Are you listening?" he asked. 

"I'm hard of hearing from weapon fire in Nam," she said. 

"You weren't in Vietnam," he said incredulously. 

"Nam, it's a place up north. Interesting place, interesting people, they shoot pool a lot. Shoot anything else that comes in their sights when drunk," she smirked with a crooked lip, almost a snarl, but definitely a challenge. 

"Here drink this," he said, and sat down facing her. 

"I'm too wired for coffee, been running on nothing else since, well," her voice tailed off not wanting to mention their moment of lust together. 

"It's hot milk," he said. 

"Thanks mom," she said, trying to sound sarcastic only it came out more appreciative and revealing than intended. 

"You look tired, time for bed," he told her. 

A little disappointed when he opened the door to the spare room she nevertheless smiled at him on closing the door. Thankfully there was a shower in a small cubicle off the bedroom. 

Feeling even more rejected she decided to test her powers of attraction like soldier readying for combat though feeling like a tired slapper. 

She slipped on the only clean clothes she had, an unmatched bra and panties, ready to confront him. Unsure of what to say she tried to work it out while looking for his room. 

She walked in and hesitated until he pulled back the covers for her. Without a word needed she gave in to simply slide into bed. He pulled the covers up and wrapped his arms around her. 

"Go to sleep, your safe now," he whispered. 

For once in her life she did as she was told. Too tired to think she sunk into a dreamless sleep of exhaustion. 

Startled from sleep she wondered where she was hoping it wouldn't be an unpleasant surprise. 

"Sit up," he told her and placed a tray on her lap. "Coffee, eggs, bacon and beans," he announced. "Eggs they way you like 'em, over easy. Well you do now, that's the only way I know how," he told her. 

Pete carefully got into bed and helped himself to the extra cup. Ravenous hunger meant the food didn't touch the sides as it was gulped down. 

Watching her struggle to place the tray on the floor he admired the round tight ass. 

"I don't fuck for food you know," she scowled. 

"I know," he stated. "You don't do it for love or money either so what do you do it for?" he chuckled. 

She hit him but without the strength he knew she had. He thought it might be a love tap but would have to get to know her better before deciding. She let him wrap his arms around her though still suspicious, like an ally cat resisting domesticity. 

"You can get comfort from a hug you know," he chided her. 

"Not fun enough," she breathed out with a throaty chuckle. Turning on him she looked serious, "I don't do it, haven't for a long time. The other night was different, you're," she creased her forehead in thought. 

"Different?" he offered. 

"Fuck you," she chuckled. 

He pulled her close and kissed her. She opened her mouth and he tasted coffee and orange but it was sweet. "I want to fuck you hard then fuck you slow," he breathed in her ear. 

She snuggled in his strong arms using him as a comforter. She knew she didn't have to and that made it all right and so she wanted to, but not just now. She was busy enjoying his caresses to her face. 

"Hey! I don't like that," she complained. 

"Your enjoying it so far so just relax and tell me when your not. It's nice I can tell," he said, while running a wet finger around her asshole. 

"Well, that is, but no further," she warned him. 

Pete wondered what her limits were and was sure she would let him know. He stretched his arm to reach further round and felt her legs part. 

"That I like. You've hit the spot," she said, in a breathy whisper. 

She hadn't needed to tell him. When her hand found and gripped his hard cock it was a clear message. 

They carried on pleasuring each other for some time. She opened her eyes wide realising he was still hard. "You didn't cum?" she asked. 

"You were too busy enjoying yourself to think of me," he playfully scolded her. 

"Well thank you kind, sir. That was a lovely way to start the day," she told him with her head on his chest. She played with his hairs, twisting them around her fingers until he gave in and said, "Ouch!" 

"I had better apologise to your neglected friend," she smiled innocently and disappeared under the sheet. 

For a moment he watched the back of her head slowly moving up and down but soon closed his eyes to concentrate on the feel of her mouth engulfing him. Too soon the promised orgasm brought a contorted look to his face that belied the pleasure. 

Her hands completed the job massaging and gripping, both his cock and balls, as he came back to earth. Curling his legs toward her he felt a wet patch and learnt something else about her. She didn't swallow. If she stayed long enough he would teach her what he liked and learn what she needed too. 

It would be fun teaching her and she had so much to learn. 

"So, are you staying?" he asked. 

"The room service is good. Maybe, lets see, a day at a time, OK?" she asked. 

"That's a song," he murmured. 

"What is?" she asked. 

"A day at a time," he croaked out of tune. 

"Let's make it our song, OK? Just don't sing it," she said, with mock sincerity. 

He slapped her ass and she giggled a lusty resonant laugh. 

All morning they romped around like teenagers. They showered together turning it into a sensuous exploration of each other bodies. They learnt where to caress and scratch and tickle to elicit yelps and laughs and more intimate sounds. When she tried to get dressed he tussled with her until she gave up, resolving into panting with lust. 

He didn't want the young vixen to escape. He wanted to get to know her. She was exciting, a challenge, and he was prepared to meet it. 

"I'm getting dressed," she declared. 

"OK," he smiled. 

She glanced at him hearing the word as though it were permission to go ahead. She hesitated reaching for the sensible black panties then shook her head with a grin. He was sprawled out across the bed, where they had been wrestling, prepared for the reverse striptease show. She would have rebelled at his turning her decision into his permission but decided to use it against him. 

"What the hell," she murmured. If that's what he wanted then why not give him something to think about. She bent over with straight legs squeezing her thighs together to push her lips between them. She took her time straightening the panties out while wiggling her ass at him. 

Purposely tangling the panties about her legs she took an age pulling them up then wiggled her bottom into them. Making sure the panties were plastered between her cheeks she picked up the jeans. With them over her thighs she adjusted the panties again then pulled the jeans up to her waist and tightened the belt pulling her tummy in. 

Turning to him, with the t-shirt dangling from a finger, she tried on an innocent look but it wasn't necessary as he was too distracted with her figure to notice. With the t-shirt over her head she lifted the small pert breasts up, holding the pose, pretending to fiddle with the top. 

She made a show of pulling it down over her breasts and when it caught on a hard nipple realised she too was aroused. The look on his face was enough to amuse her as well as bringing on a familiar tingling sensation between the legs. 

"Are you ready?" she asked. 

"Uh, pretty much," he smiled. 

"I meant for a shopping trip," she scolded him, with hands on hips. She expected him to cry off the idea but he jumped up to get dressed. 

"We'll get lunch first to build up the energy," he said pulling on his jeans. 

"Energy for what?" she asked suspiciously. 

"Shopping, what else?" he asked in mock surprise. 

Josie expected him to drag her back to bed or mean they needed energy for another session. It was a pleasant surprise to be driven to a mall to actually shop. Even better he pointed out clothing stores she might be interested in on the way to his favourite coffee stop. 

"You're not choosing my clothes. Not now, not ever. Yea, that's nice but I don't wear dresses. I just don't like the idea of you buying me stuff," she hissed at him, trying not to attract attention. 

Reluctantly she pulled on a light summer dress reluctantly having to agree with the choice. It was hot out there and it would feel cool. She was also surprised he hadn't tried to dress her in short skirt and halter top or something more brazen. 

Twirling in a mirror she began to agree. It showed off her figure to advantage without being slutty. When he looked at her she felt feminine and attractive. A look of pride in his eyes left her feeling light headed and alive. 

"Can I trust you to pick some underwear?" She pulled the dress tight against her body showing how the black panties and bra were outlined. "White, comfortable and sensible," she warned him. She went back into the changing room wondering what he might fetch, expecting it to be an uncomfortable thong. 

He brought back just the right thing. "You don't need to wear the bra, do you?" he asked. 

Thinking he was referring to them being too small she almost poked him in the ribs. The look on his face told a different story. It was unusual for her to give in to anyone but so far she had so decided to continue until she found out what he was up to. She shrugged her shoulders and quickly pulled on the panties.  

===

There wasn't an elaborate show this time. She handed him the bra through the curtain. This seemed to please him and so she too was happy. 'Was this how it is to be in love,' she thought, then quickly dismissed the stupid notion. 

She let him take her hand as they made their way to another store. She felt like a young girl being taken out on a birthday treat. It was a unique sensation, leaving her feeling giddy with its implications. 

In a bar Josie wouldn't care if men looked over her figure even when a t-shirt hugged her breasts revealing firm nipples. In this light innocent mood she felt naughty. Her man was taking her for a treat, dressing her and pampering her, paying her sweet attention. 

When she left Pete to look in a store front a group of young workmen taking a break looked her over her, obviously discussing her. The reflection in the window clearly displayed the outline of her breasts and the white panties, so she knew exactly what had drawn their attention. 

A first reaction was to turn on them with a rude remark. Instead she pretended not to hear while innocently studying the shoes. It was unusual for her not to fight back but for once it was thrilling and arousing. 

Walking back to Pete her gait wasn't the usual stride, instead she found herself swaying her hips, playing up to them. Pete was ordering coffee. 

"See anything you liked, something exciting?" he asked. 

She giggled and told him what had happened. Expecting him to object she was surprised at his reaction. 

"That explains why your nipples are so hard," he laughed. "You're a bit of an exhibitionist," he added. 

"No way!" she objected. He might be right but there was not a chance she would admit to such a sordid little secret. 

"Go to the rest room and remove your panties. No-one will know in here but you and I will. We'll see how you react," he challenged. 

On the spur of the moment she got up and did as he suggested, thinking this was becoming a bad habit, doing what he asked. There was something irresistible the way he challenged her. Besides, she wanted to find out if he was right; how would she feel? 

Walking back through the dimly lit cafe one or two customers looked her way but there was nothing unusual in that. What was different was the way she felt. A thrill ran through her entire body. The feeling of cool air on her lips told her they were moist; not that she needed confirmation. 

Josie sat down carefully with legs together, so as not to wet the front of the dress or the seat. She grimaced at him no longer sure this was such a good idea. He gave her a big grin and squeezed her hand. 

"I was right," he told her. 

Was he right? She felt a certain buzz. It felt as though her pussy was humming some naughty tune. Distracted in thought she was caught off guard when he pulled her panties from her hand. She watched him slipping them into his pocket. With a smile he challenged her to ask for them back. 

She swallowed noisily, feeling vulnerable and aroused, knowing he expected her to walk through the mall without them. It was such a small thing to do yet her legs felt weak. 

"Go buy some shoes," he teased. "I'll meet you back here." 

Unable to linger outside, in front of the workmen, she marched to the door no longer confidence enough to swing her hips. She felt too nervous. 

In the doorway she hesitated wondering if she could go through with it. The sunlight shone through the summer dress showing off a daring silhouette but she only realised that when a salesman looked up at her. The look was enough. 

Resisting the impulse to turn around and run back to Pete she instead marched in among the racks. Absent minded she browsed the racks not taking in the display of high heels, just wondering what the hell she was doing there. 

"My names Carl, can I help you? I'll get your size, I'd guess a six?" the salesman asked. 

Josie hadn't even been aware she was holding a black high heel shoe. Startled from the reverie she simply nodded not knowing what else to do. Should she have told him she was merely browsing then left? 

"Here, sit down and try these on," Carl said. 

He was older than Pete but hadn't kept himself in trim. He was thin yet flabby from having worked in a store rather than out in the open air. When he bent down with the shoes to help she saw how he had combed hair over a bald patch. Stifling a cutting remark she turned it into a cough instead. 

Josie tried to ignore this was a dare and counter the nervousness by telling herself it was just a shopping trip. Slipping off one of hers he caught her by surprise by lifting a heel to slip on the new shoe. 

She realised how nervous and out of her depth this new experience left her. It was obvious what he was doing but she couldn't seem to stop him. He lifted the other heel toward him, slightly higher this time, so the hem rode up her thighs. 

Way before this outrage, even in her jeans, she would have kicked the skinny bald man in the groin. Pete had manoeuvred her into this but she just sat their unable to pull away from the guy. Her legs were slightly parted but they seemed to be glued to the seat when trying to draw her thighs together. 

She squirmed a little feeling the textured cloth of the seat on her bare bottom through the thin dress. He was studiously clipping the high heels to her feet, not staring at her as expected. She was waiting for him to look up the dress and see her hairy snatch. 

He had obviously seen its outline when she awkwardly stood in the doorway in the sun, so knew she wore no panties. She didn't want to reveal herself to this imperfect stranger yet it was fascinating to watch him clearly ignoring the obvious as though he were teasing her in turn. 

He lifted the shoe nearest to him and said, "It looks superb. What do you think?" He asked, while looking directly between her legs. 

Josie felt the hem slide up her thighs a little more. Her eyes were on the shoe he was holding up, twisting her foot from side to side, as though admiring it. Instead she was playing his game by giving a better view up the damn dress. She just couldn't help it as though she were playing to a script, letting him spy on her nakedness. 

She had never felt so helpless in her life. She knew how to defend herself but this was different. It was confusing. The blatant naughtiness of it was stirring her up, speeding up her breathing and heart rate. She couldn't even bring to mind a sarcastic remark to put him off. 

He let her go returning to the cash register. Without her consent he boxed and wrapped the shoes and returned holding them out to her. Scrambling through her purse she handed him a wedge of notes grabbed the package and scuttled out of the store. 

She thought she heard him chuckling as she left. It was a nice generous contagious laugh and she too began to laugh as she saw Pete striding toward her. "Quick, get me out of here," she said, grabbing a hold of his arm. Pressing close to him for protection they scooted across the car park to the van. 

"No! In the back," she said, with panting short breaths as though they had sprinted all the way. 

"So you did enjoy it!" he exclaimed, as she pulled off the dress. He didn't have a chance to say much else as she roughly pulled at his clothes. Almost ripping them off to get at what she wanted he let her take charge. 

With jeans stuck around his ankles she sat astride him riding his cock. He bucked his hips up at her, pushing with his muscular legs. He reached up with both large hands squeezing her breasts. Like a wild thing she bore down on him reaching a quick orgasm ignoring his needs. 

He slowed down pushing at her calmly watching the expressions on her face changing and developing. Within seconds she started all over again. This time it became less frantic until she regained enough control to remember he was there. 

She snuggled up in his arms kissing his chest. She smiled at him then looked around. "We're in your van," she said. Her face changed as though everything had suddenly come flooding back. Not just the heat of the moment decorated her cheeks but embarrassment tinged them bright red. 

She looked at him as though to say, 'what's next', and he wondered if he had opened Pandora's Box. A wicked smile lit his face wondering if hers might be opened too. This wasn't the moment to take her virgin ass but it would be worth waiting for.  

===

Josie wasn't too good at domestic chores or taking orders. Her father had tried to teach her some discipline but as a teenager she had rebelled. So here she was a wanderer in search of something, not knowing what. She had been moving from place to place, living frugally, and slowly spending the inheritance. 

Somehow she had taken to Pete so moved in, with meagre possessions, but with a load of personal baggage. 

He didn't expect much or demand much, so just this once let herself be organised. Between them they had the house clean and tidy and she was ready to play another game. 

Pete had a military father too but he had taken on board a sense of duty and discipline. Hence the scrubbed quarters and his demand that she not leave her clothes scattered across the bedroom floor. In a sulk Josie had collected all her clothes up and threw them into the washer only to realise there was nothing left to wear. 

"Women always complain they've got nothing to wear though I must admit I've never known a woman travel so light. It's your fault the new dress is messed up, you dragged me into the back of the van, remember?" he reminded her, with a chuckle. 

He liked the way she pouted when not getting her own way. He was teasing and she knew it but played along anyway. 

"I won't wear it out for damn sake; I need it till my clothes are dry. It's the only one of yours that fits," she said. It looked as though she were going to stamp a foot in frustration. 

"That is a special souvenir, a Rolling Stone concert no less. You're not wearing it!" he warned, with a loaded finger, aimed right at her. He looked at it knowing he would never be able to get into the old t-shirt again but this was a cherished reminder of a carefree youth. 

"I can't go around naked!" she complained. Seeing the look of devilment on his face she realised why he was being so stubborn. It may have been a treasured item but there was more than an old t-shirt on his mind. "Here, keep your damn t-shirt," she said, throwing it at him and stomping off to the kitchen. 

She didn't want him to see the cheeky grin developing on her face, not wanting him to realise she was ready to give in. If it was a game he was planning she wanted in as his games tended to end up real nice. She giggled then quickly calmed herself ready to confront him. 

"I guess the machine won't take much longer. Are there any more chores or shall we eat?" Josie asked. She was nonchalantly walking around the house naked; watching him out of the corner of an eye, trying to catch what he was up to. Was this it? Did he just want her on display? This was no fun! 

He was comfortably settled in front of the television which didn't suit her expectations at all. She brought him a beer and walked in front of the T.V. to deliver it. Her patience was running low. She bowed over him presenting a pair of small breasts almost thrusting them at him. Turning around she bent over a small table and backed up toward him with it. In that position she was showing off a pair of delicious lips squashed between tight thighs. 

"You can park it here," she said. Her tone of voice was still matter of fact though she was becoming frustrated from being ignored. 

"Here?" he said. She squealed in surprise as he pushed the ice cold can into her crotch. Already strung out from the waiting game she jumped with fright. While she was caught off guard he pulled her onto his lap and slapped her ass. 

"That's for being a naughty tease," he laughed. "This is for being impatient," he said, as he slapped her again. She was laughing and struggling, out of breath or breathing hard from arousal. He knew if she really did want to get free there was no stopping her. She could hit out hard and wrestle with skill if she had a mind to. 

Pete knew she was in the mood to play, expecting him to come up with something new, but he needed to slow her down. She had a tendency to get carried away while he wanted to make it last. 

"You're a naughty vixen and need to learn some discipline," he told her. 

"You told me that before," she returned. Remembering his words from the night they met led onto what happened next day. Being run out of town by the cops wasn't such a big deal but it hit home. She was drifting and not far off a lee shore, as her father would have warned. 

"You think you're the one to teach me?" she teased. 

He slapped her bottom, harder this time. "Don't you ever do as you're told?" he asked. 

It stung but she held back the yelp. She didn't like this kind of game but got the sense he was just experimenting too. 'OK,' she thought, 'Let's see where we go, after all, every journey is an adventure.' 

"Sorry sir, I'll be a good little girl, please don't spank me," she pleaded, contriving a little remorseful voice as best she could. 

Pete slid her off his knees onto the floor at his feet. "Go stand in the corner and don't move," he ordered. He wanted to laugh at her girly act for it was so unlike her but didn't want to spoil the atmosphere. He knew it wouldn't last long as impatience would soon have her stomping around in frustrated irritation. 

He strode to the bedroom to set things up then quickly to the bathroom. Back in the lounge he told her, "Stop fidgeting. Is your ass sore? Just come over here," he told her, knowing she wouldn't admit her red cheeks were tender. 

She stood before him naked, swinging her hips with hands clasped behind her back. The innocent expression on her face didn't work. She was sticking out her breasts at him then swinging her pussy forward. The temptress was working on him, so he had to slow her down, and demonstrate he was the boss. 

Pete didn't plan on becoming too worked up before he had a chance to work on her. He wanted to heat her up and push her a little further toward what he wanted. Unsure as to the direction he nevertheless wanted to try something out. Try something, hell he wanted to try everything! She was a beautiful sexy young woman and a chance like this only came along once in a life time. 

They only had to be in the same room together for sexual tension to have them both excited, badly needing sex. He also knew she would become bored with plain ordinary fucking, so it was important to quickly find out what would keep her interest. He had already found out she had an exhibitionist streak so would build upon it. 

He pulled her down over his knee and she shrieked in keeping with the act. This time he rubbed her sore bottom with ointment. "Is that better?" he asked. 

"Thank you, sir. Thank you for soothing my bottom. Thank you for punishing your naughty girl. Your naughty girl needs to learn discipline, sir" she said in the little voice, trying not to giggle. If she had known it annoyed him she would have put more effort into it. 

One hand massaged her back and shoulders while fingers teased her sex. Just missing her lips he rubbed the grease around her pussy and over her sore bottom. When she started to suck in air loudly through an open mouth and nose, it revealed how turned on she was. She was becoming more pliable. His fingers slipped between her cheeks over her asshole. 

Pushing at her asshole he felt it tense, so he ran the fingers back over her swollen lips. With both hands concentrating on her pussy she relaxed. With a thumb pressing her little hard button and a finger exploring inside she became limp over is lap. He slid the fingers of both hands between her thighs until she gave in completely. 

He watched her opening up, twitching to every movement of his fingers. Both hands were working on her sex, inside and out. Fingers slid up between her cheeks over her asshole but this time she didn't tense up. 

A small finger slipped into her greasy asshole. It clenched around his finger for a moment then relaxed; opening up a little. He pushed ever so slowly then started to pump faster in her asshole in time with the fingers in her pussy. In a smooth movement he replaced the little finger with his ring finger while wriggling another two in her pussy. 

Josie could hear the little pathetic mewling sounds but couldn't stop. For once someone had taken her over leaving a bundle of raw nerves needing to be scratched. The need for his soothing fingers started calmly when they skimmed over her bottom becoming insistent as they progressed to her lips. She had nearly begged him to touch her there. On feeling him delve in she gave in completely. 

Whatever he wanted to do to her she would submit to just so long as those delicious fingers gave so much pleasure. The sensations were radiating out from her pussy throughout her body. Growing in intensity the feelings left her helpless, needing exactly what he was doing and lots of it. The more he touched the more she needed it. 

"Don't stop, don't stop," she demanded. It was like being caught on the edge of a diving board, not wanting to fall just yet, knowing the thrill was inevitable. She was losing rational thought. Clouds of meaningless ideas misted her mind. This was not going to be a sudden orgasm for it was building slowly into something amazing. 

It felt so near it hurt, so she tried harder to cum, but the finishing line retreated agonisingly further away. She struggled to reach it, only to be taken further into the unknown. Where it might end didn't matter any more, just so long as she arrived. If her body exploded with the white heat generated from between her legs, spreading through her belly to her breasts and beyond, so be it. 

"Do you want to cum?" he whispered in her ear. He had to repeat the question for she was in a far away place where words lost their meaning. She relied on touch, his touch. 

"Please," she said, the word elongated almost out of recognition on an outward rush of breath. 

Pete stopped his fingers in and around her pussy. A finger up her ass continued to delve gently. The low rumble of noise from her throat broadcast a clear message of pitiful anguish. 

"Please, Sir, let me cum make me cum, please" she croaked. 

That was more like it, that's what he wanted to hear. His fingers worked upon her like the devil. Insidiously he played her like an instrument, not an instrument of torture, her body was a tool of pure gratification. Needing to cum but unable to reach the final goal was a dreadful form of torture but she knew, without doubt, it must be endured to reach nirvana. All she could do was lay there letting him work her hard. Her body was all his then at the last moment her mind became his too. 

"I'm cumin," she trilled. In a high pitched squeak. In a throaty roar, she announced her fulfilment over and over again. Her voice sounded surprised when she repeated it in a prolonged announcement. 

More gently and less frenetically he played with her. He squeezed every last drop of pleasure from her juicy container. The words were repeated, as she needed him to keep playing the wonderful tune. She sounded delirious as she continued to repeat the magic words. It wasn't a multiple orgasm it was continuous cum. 

As though trying to keep her in a state of delirium for ever he gently stroked her sex and asshole which had become super sensitive. Every movement generated a quiver of flesh and muscle. He began to experiment with strokes that elicited a cheek spasm; another touch trembled thighs, while a nail over a swollen lip curled her toes. 

Pressing her swollen bud then scratching it with a thumbnail brought on a trembling of her entire body. With every teasing touch another aftershock of an orgasm racked her body and mind. He enjoyed playing with her with finger tips and blowing upon a hot little box. A hand hovered gently over her bottom and thighs, hardly touching the sensitised flesh. The little whimpers of bliss were gratifying. 

His fingers ached as must her pussy and asshole. He let her loll there supine, obviously depleted. It looked as though her stuffing had been removed or she was a blow-up doll with a puncture. 

He too felt exhausted from watching her orgasm over and over. He could and often did work hard all day without feeling this tired, but the strenuous emotion had drained him. 

"No more, please, sir," she croaked. 

At last he could relax. He sat back with eyes closed, both hands resting heavily on her bottom and back. This would keep her interest, he hoped. If not he was in trouble. Still, this kind of trouble could be interesting he chuckled to himself, and fell into a light doze. 

*** 

Shaking his head awake he pulled her into his arms. Rocking up from the sofa he managed to stand with the dead weight of an inert body. He hadn't heard of anyone dying from an orgasm but guessed it might be possible after watching such an exhibition. 

He carried her into the bedroom. Used to carrying the heavy materials for building work, he decided this was more difficult, but so much more enjoyable. If he ever became bored with carrying a naked woman into his bedroom, that was the time to give up life. 

He plonked her down on the bed and grabbed a dressing gown cord attached to the bed-head. He pushed the ready made loop around her wrist. 

She noticed him pull something tight around a wrist and on trying to pull away found the other hand was secure too. Still feeling drained and drowsy she could do nothing but watch as though from a distance. 

"What are you doing?" she murmured. She licked dry lips and flicked her eyelids trying to restore muzzy thoughts into something more substantial. 

His hand slid down a leg holding it flat to the bed and looped an old tie over one ankle then the same to the other ankle. He watched her squirming, huffing and puffing from exertion for a moment, until she again sank into the bed exhausted. He pulled at each of the ropes in turn pulling her limbs taut over the bed. 

"Let me go! I don't like this, it's not my thing," she grumbled. Her voice wasn't much more than a whisper. It didn't sound very convincing either. 

"You had your fun, now it's my turn," he challenged. 

"I mean it! I want out," Josie said. Unable to move much she had to concentrate on talking him out of it. Before she could martial her thoughts he interrupted. 

"You are always driving, don't you ever relax? Are you afraid to let someone take charge for once?" he asked. He watched her hesitate a moment. He draped a black cloth over the pillow beside her head. She strained her eyes, looking sideways, trying to discover what it was. 

"It's a blindfold. I'm not going to use it unless you want me to," he told her, while stroking her hair. 

"What are you going to do to me," she sniffed, trying to sound unconcerned. 

"Don't you trust me?" he asked. 

The devilish smile on his face didn't for once beget trust. "I don't trust anyone, that way I'm not disappointed," she stated, with a mean streak showing strongly. "After what you did earlier, well, I guess I could give you a chance," she said. Her face relaxed into a pleasant smile, obviously from thinking about his playing with her. 

"I'm going to tickle and tease you. Kiss and caress you," he said plainly, as though thinking over a list of barbecue meats, purposely bereft of excitement. Having warned her he bent low over an exposed bellybutton and blew a raspberry in it. She giggled in a cute girly way. He kissed and licked her belly making progress up toward a heaving breast. 

"Its torture but I can stand it," she sighed. A blissful look overcame the remnants of a suspicious expression. 

He fished under the bed for a razor and brush. She giggled lightly at first from the tickling bristles until realising what he was about to do. 

"No!" she crooned, elongating the little word out for emphasis. "It'll itch like hell when it grows out," she complained plaintively. Feeling him purposely tickle her lips the complaints lessened as she became ever more aroused. The brush was finding every crack and crevice at her crotch with teasing sensations threatening to send her over the edge. 

Even the razor gliding over the fine hairs sensitised her crotch. It wasn't just her pussy on fire it was everywhere between her thighs. He pulled upon her lips and propped her up on a pillow under her hips to get every last hair, until she was completely bald. 

He blew upon her, fanning the flames with his hot breath. His fingers explored all those newly exposed tender places that had become so responsive she began to whimper. Needing to grab a hold of him, to pull him close, she pulled desperately upon her bonds. The frustration matched the need within her pussy. 

She didn't feel a hand squeezing a breast, teeth nipping a nipple, fingers inside her pussy, a finger up her anus with a thumb rubbing her bud, as it all became one great throbbing sensation. It was as though her whole body and mind had become a mere extension of her sex. 

Pete could feel the heat of her cunt rising up at him. With every touch of her body she twitched uncontrollably. With every part of him working upon her flesh she quaked as though trying to get at him, desperate to have him inside her. The soft moans became urgent pleas not to stop then back to deep rumbling animal like grunts. The occasional sob for his cock was heard among the unintelligible groans as though she were in pain. 

He was going to tease her until it felt like torture, for both of them then he would fuck her. After that he would get her to fuck him. After that, if he was still awake, well, they would find out. 

*** 

After sharing a shower they were at last ready for food. Looking over her shoulder with a look of daring she got what she wanted. He chased her toward the kitchen, catching her to playfully slap a bare cheek up the short dress. 

"OK! You win, you're the boss," Josie laughed. "What do you want for breakfast?" 

"I'll make the breakfast," Pete sighed. 

"After yesterday I'll do anything, what you did to me, I just don't know. I didn't know it could be like that. Is that what it's like when you're married?" she asked. 

"No. It depends on the couple I suppose. We seem to bring out something in each other. Nice?" he asked. 

"Nice? Bloody fantastic! I want to feed you up so you can do it again. I'm even willing to go all domestic. Do you want me to be your little girly? I'll even play along with that! Whatever it takes to turn you on, I'm game," she laughed. 

There was genuine happiness in her voice with the whole body language joyfully vibrant. He had never heard her sing before. She didn't know all the words to 'One Day at a Time' but hummed along between phrases. She was even wearing a dress instead of the usual jeans and t-shirt. He noticed in the sunshine she wore no underwear. 

"Sit! I'm hungry so I'll cook as long as you learn, sometime," he chided her. 

"If you give me a chance between fucks," she teased. 

"My favourite!" she said, between gulps. "You can't beat a fried breakfast." 

Pete hardly got a word in but was happy to listen to the inane chatter. He watched her push the plate away and stretch close across the table. 

"You want me to tie you up today?" she asked, with a devilish grin lighting her eyes. "You told me I always want to be in control but you are a hundred times worse than me," she teased. "Don't you ever let go?" 

"No and No," he smiled, though the look was serious. 

"OK! You can tie me up if you like," she said, and leant closer over the table. "Or, you could take me right now over the kitchen table," she said, with a throaty whisper. The smile faded leaving an earnest look. The sleepiness had gone; her eyes were wide with the whites showing bright, glinting with morning sunshine. 

"I'm tempted. You're not wearing panties so I could just lift the back of that little light summer dress and slam into you. I can almost smell your sex from here. You're ready for it," he paused, seeing her listening intently and the imperceptible nod of agreement. 

"You'd be easy to take, being all worked up. I bet your wet an open, just ready for my dick," he said, and cocked his head to one side, turning it into a question.  

===

"Yes!" she gasped. 

"Tell me," he demanded. 

"Just fuck me," she demanded, then relented. "Please! Hell, I'm like a bitch on heat around you. What you do to me is diabolical. Stop looking at me with those big sad old eyes. OK!" she said in frustration. She licked her lips, not meaning it to be sensual, just needing to from dryness. She had been breathing faster and deeper, obviously aroused. 

"Please, sir. Your little girly needs to be spanked, she has been so naughty," she pleaded. Grabbing hold of the table she pulled her body over it pressing her sex against the edge. "Teach your little girly some discipline, sir. Then fuck me hard," she breathed out all in one breath. 

When he just looked at her with a taunting smile she knew he wanted more. "Please, sir, I'll behave and do as I'm told. I just need to feel your big hard cock filling my juicy cunt," she broke off with a gasp, surprised at the lewd language. With a pained expression she continued. "I'll be a good slut, please fuck your slut, please!" she moaned. 

"Your right, you need to learn some discipline, you can't have it all your own way all the time," he told her. 

"What?" she exclaimed. A look of dire disappointment turned to anger. 

"We're not playing slap the girly game today," he laughed. 

"Shit! Look at you, your ready too. Why not just do it?" she asked. A look of shame flashed across her face to be replaced by anger. Her voice was raised now. She walked quickly around the table to get at him, all the time flexing her hands into fists. "You bastard, come here! You can't wind me up like that!" she wailed. 

She followed him through the kitchen door looking mean enough to fight. "Get in," he told her. She stopped by the work-van hesitating. The look of curiosity on her face reflected she had just worked out he planned this whole routine that had brought her out here. Still looking mean she began to climb in. 

She thought he was helping and was about to tell him to get lost. Instead he whipped the dress up her back. With head and arms trapped in it he slapped her ass then gripped her breasts. One leg was up in the van unintentionally spreading her legs for him. Still on fire she pressed back with her bare ass not caring they were outside. 

The unexpected attention stopped the profane refusal of help and the complaint of having the dress raised too. Before she could rally he had the dress off and shoved her into the van. He locked the door before she knew what was happening. 

She covered her breasts and clamped her legs tight together. He had her worked up again, although she hadn't really come back down from the kitchen teasing. Damn! She thought about what he did to her yesterday and told herself to be patient. She knew it would be worth the wait but he had her so needy it was difficult. 

When he climbed in she looked at him with venom in her eyes. 

"If looks could kill!" he laughed. "You said I could do anything with you," he offered in defence. When they drove off she still said nothing. 

"Where are you taking me?" she eventually asked. 

She sounded suitably chastened and on guard. "Are you ready for anything?" he asked. When she didn't answer he nudged her with a hard finger. "You trust me now don't you?" he asked, flashing a big smile. 

"I guess, sure, maybe. No-one else is going to be involved are they?" she asked, hesitantly. 

"Not directly. We need gas and you're filling it up," Pete told her. 

"No!" she exclaimed. Josie looked at him to see if he was serious. It was bad enough riding around naked in his van. "Please, Sir," she said. The little girl voice was put on telling him she was willing to co-operate in playing a game but there had to be a boundary. 

"You may speak, girl," he said firmly. This was much better; she was learning to ask rather than demand. He didn't care much for the little girl thing but she was learning who was in charge. 

She snorted in disgust but complied anyway. "Your naughty girl doesn't want, can't go outside naked, please, Sir," she stated. 

He let her stew for a bit. The route out of town was selected for the lack of traffic as Pete didn't want to push her too far, yet. 

"Your dress is in back, if you need it," he said, leaving it as a dare. 

She looked over her shoulder but didn't make a move for it. The consternation was plain on her face. It looked as though she wanted to cover her naked body but was still burning enough to want to play a game. Josie had learnt it was worth playing his game under his rules. 

When they pulled into a gas station he sat looking at her. 

"What must your girl do, Sir," she asked. She flashed him a look of anger but there was a glint of passion in her eyes too. Whether she liked it or not her sex was forcing her to play along. 

"You can get your dress, if you must, then its up to you," he told her. His firm tone sounded like an order. A few days ago she would have rebelled against it but he watched her prepare herself. There was a choice to be made. Turn around and bend over the back of the seat to reach the dress meant showing off her ass, or, get out naked and dress in the back of the van. 

There were no customers around so she nipped out and slid open the side door. Grabbing the dress she quickly pulled it over her head. 

"Hey, you'll need this, unless you intend to pay in kind," he told her. She took the notes and strode off to get the pump switched on. Pete watched the guy watching her. She came back, still in a huff, to pump gas. 

Pete watched the attendant staring at her silhouette through the light cotton dress. It was a surprise when she bent over facing away from the store. There wasn't much of a breeze but it wouldn't take much to lift the hem. 

Pete thought he could see the old guy rub himself while gazing intently at her. He was probably wishing fervently for the wind to get up. It was clear she wore nothing underneath and the silhouette gave a tantalising foretaste of a well rounded ass. 

The pump clicked off. Josie looked at the meter seeing only half the cash had been used up with the van's tank brimming. Passing Pete she poked her tongue out with a devilish grin. She knew he had planned it this way, making her go back in for change. 

By now the guy had a good look at her and liked what he saw. He counted some notes then pretended there wasn't enough in the register. "Can I get you anything else, save getting change out back?" the old guy asked. 

He was obviously keeping her in the store wanting to get a better look at her. Well, let's give the old guy a thrill she thought. It might have been a repulsive thought before Pete had introduced her to such naughty ideas. Besides, she was aroused and frustrated, ready to make someone else suffer too. 

"I'll take a look," she shrugged. Bending over just enough, without revealing too much, was an art form all women knew well. Josie bent over, giving a tantalising view of her thighs, and picked up a can of nuts. "Is this out of date?" she asked. He hurried over and stood too while closely examining the bottom of the can. 

She bent over shoving it back on the low shelf pressing up against his leg with her ass. "Sorry," she blushed. The colour in her cheeks wasn't from embarrassment, as she pretended, it was from a surge of inner heat. 

"If you want nuts there's a box in back, you can check them out," he suggested. 

The way he looked at her she dare not, so shook her head and moved on along the shelves. He looked like a rough farmer, around fifty, who had worked outside all his life. Perhaps she should leave him alone and just leave. 

"Oh! I just love party poppers," she managed to say without giggling. She felt so naughty she couldn't help acting like an innocent young girl. 

"The shelving won't take my weight, you'll do it OK? Just step up there," he said, pointing to a shelf. 

"Are you sure sir, I'm not good at climbing," she lied. Having scaled an army assault course, with her father bellowing at raw recruits, this was a piece of cake. Her fathers trick worked every time as the weakest of the recruits put the extra effort in just to beat his little girl to the finish. 

She put a foot on a low shelf to timidly pull herself up. "Don't let me fall, sir," she said, in a small fragile voice. It was her turn to tease someone and she was enjoying it. This was almost better than wrestling a man to the floor. 

He placed his hand low on her back close to her ass, only just within decency. Hesitating as though afraid to reach up she asked, "I can't look down. Where can I put my foot? Will it take my weight?" she asked. 

"You're just a little thing you'll be fine, no problem," he said. 

She could hear the big grin in his voice. Josie felt his big old calloused hand grip an ankle as he positioned it onto the next shelf up. "Oh! I'm not sure about this," she sighed expressively. 

"Keep going you're nearly there," he told her. 

A hand on her rump pushed her up close to the rack. Both hands left her body leaving her clinging on. 

He grabbed her ankles. "Don't worry I've got you," he said, not bothering to sound reassuring. He was scrunched down, almost kneeling, looking up the dress. 

"Don't let me fall, sir," she said timidly, as though afraid. If she fell now the hold on her ankles would be useless but he didn't care about that. She didn't either. 

"You can't reach up like that you need to spread your weight over the shelf. Here, I'll place your foot better," he told her. Lifting a foot he placed it further over spreading her legs apart. 

Her newly shaved pussy was so sensitive she could feel his heavy breathing upon her moist lips. "I think I can reach," she said. Stretching up pulled her apart giving him an even better view of her slit. She had been teased all morning leaving it swollen and open. 

Looking down at him it was obvious she had teased him to much. He was ready to reach up for what he could clearly see was ripe and juicy, ready for the picking. She couldn't let him touch her and was feeling just a little sordid at the thought of it. It would be her fault too which only made her feel worse. 

An emergency descent and escape was called for. "I'm going to fall!" she exclaimed in alarm. It was really a warning that she was jumping down out of his way. 

She half turned and miss-timed the drop to fall into his up stretched arms. The little dress snagged on his large calloused hands ruffling up under her bust. 

"Oh! Thank you sir," she said gratefully, pretending to be unaware of her nakedness. 

He took a firm hold of her elbows pinning them to her sides, effectively holding the dress up. "Oh my, I'm sorry sir. I'm so clumsy!" she shivered as though scared from the fall. 

He slid his arms around her for a hug. "It's OK, girl, nothing broken. You're alright," he breathed heavily into her hair. He patted her back then her bottom. 

"My dress! What must you think of me?" she fluttered, like a little bird in distress. He didn't notice the elbow in a rib pushing him away. He just stumbled back taking in the sight of a pair of shapely legs, topped by thin thighs squeezing together a shaved pussy. 

He stood there licking his lips watching her perform a worthy vaudeville routine. Instead of pulling the dress swiftly down, she managed to trap a hand knotting it under her breasts. "Please, help me cover myself," she implored. 

He pushed a rough hand up what was left of the dress covering her bust, attempting to pull her hand free. She felt his hand over her breast and genuinely looked startled though it wasn't from fear. She was astonished at how far she was going with what was intended to be just a simple little tease. She made a mental note not to underestimate the effect of her arousal when playing a game. 

Another tug freed his hand from her breast and the dress fell down around her thighs. "I'm sorry, sir," she stammered. Her cheeks flushed with genuine embarrassment. 

Looking down, unable to look him in the eye, she noticed the tent in his trousers collapsing. 

A little shiver of distaste ran through her body knowing she had given the old guy satisfaction. He had seen her slick pussy close up, patted her bare ass and felt her tits. She couldn't blame him for coming in his pants rather it left a nasty feeling of being at fault. 

She wondered how many women let their man cum without receiving satisfaction themselves. On that basis she just had sex with this old man. Having sex with a complete stranger in a public place made it all the more disgraceful. 

He had cum in his pants but didn't seem embarrassed or annoyed. He looked so pleased she began to feel happy for him. He wasn't leering at her or unpleasant about it he seemed as embarrassed as she was. 

Not knowing what to say, she squirmed on the spot. "Please don't tell anyone of my unseemly behaviour, sir," she said with a shy smile. 

He gruffly murmured something. She raised the party poppers and he nodded. 

Josie sprinted out of the store. On the run to the van she wondered if she had just had sex for a pack of party poppers. 

"Where's the change?" Pete asked. 

"I'll owe you," she said, patting non-existent pockets. A weary grin spread across her face but she couldn't tell Pete why. She had just worked out she had effectively paid that old guy for sex. 

"I got these, OK!" she said, holding up the party poppers. 

They travelled awhile in silence until she was ready to tell him what happened. The whole sordid story came out with little embarrassed giggles. Josie kept interrupting herself with the phrase, "I can't believe I did that." 

Pete couldn't believe it either. She had been a bit of a 'Tom boy' when he met her, ready to fight anyone who touched her. 

"You had better be more careful later. We're on our way to a BDSM club," he said, looking straight at the road while straining his senses for a reaction. 

"Oh!" she said. 

They travelled a few miles before curiosity got the better of her. "What's it like?" 

"No idea, never been. Don't worry I'll keep a close eye on you," he chuckled.

Hit 03 

Kidnapping is against the club rules 

Arriving early Pete and Josie called in at a cafe for a coffee. They browsed the menu but were too nervous to eat. 

"It's open but I don't fancy being the first in there," Pete mused. 

"Yea, I hate being first at a party," Josie added. She looked at him wondering if he was as nervous as she felt. It was their first time to such a place and the challenge of facing the unknown was daunting. She appreciated he was thinking up challenges to keep her interest but wanted to tell him not to bother. 

He was always so much under control it was difficult to fathom what he felt or thought. It left her with a sense of freedom and was partly the reason she stayed. She watched him staring out of the plate glass window; he seemed to be watching the evening streets darken. She wondered if the big old hunk of a man was in love with her for she was falling for him and that was usually enough to find her packing. 

"What's going on over there?" he asked. 

Josie looked across the street to see a young girl sitting in a doorway. She had a blanket around her knees with a battered old metal mug in front of her. The young woman was begging. "Her?" Josie asked, pointing with a coffee cup. She watched a young guy slap her face and with an automatic reaction Josie winced. It wasn't hard, just meant to emphasis whatever he had told her. 

"The bastard!" they both said in unison. The sad way she looked into the battered metal mug said it all. Whatever pitiful amount earned he had pocketed. He ruffled her hair in a demeaning manner and strode off. 

"What kind of bastard robs a beggar?" Pete exclaimed. 

"He's working her. Probably has several others working the area," Josie proffered. 

Pete looked at her with a tight lipped mouth. "He's like a pimp?" he eventually asked. 

"Probably is a pimp, running other girls for that too. Begging earns a good sum in the right area. He probably supplies them with drugs and somewhere to sleep," she opined, with a shrug and an unpleasant grimace. 

"I was going to ask why they work for someone. So its drugs as well as protection," he surmised. "I hate cities," he sighed. 

*** 

They crossed the road avoiding the sad looking young woman as most passers by did. Pete couldn't help but look her over wandering what brought someone so low as to beg on the streets. Had she run away to the city from a normal family life only to fall on hard times? 

They entered through an ordinary looking door, no lurid signs, no metal studs. It simply opened onto a dark corridor with a set of stairs at the end leading down to a basement. With her stomach muscles churning Josie felt as though she were about to tumble down into hell. She said she would try anything once, but the only thing keeping her going was the fear of failing or making a fool of her self. 

Before she could descend the steps Pete grabbed a wrist. The sudden movement startled her. A door set to one side was the entrance not as they assumed down the steps to the basement. A sign was screwed to the door - it cautioned all who entered to leave their prejudices outside and to always obey the club rules. 

"What are the club rules?" she asked. 

"I guess there's only one way to find out," Pete said and banged on the door with a hard workman's fist. 

"It's open," a high pitched friendly voice shouted. 

They looked at each other with weak smiles. Pete turned the large ornate gothic style handle and pushed the door open. It creaked theatrically as though it were a horror movie prop. 

"Sorry about that, must get some oil, you're not members, are you?" the old chap with a high pitched voice enquired. 

"No. I emailed and they said to come on up and look the place over. Thinking of becoming a member," Pete explained. 

"Well that's fine for Monday to Thursday, quiet evenings, but not on Fridays. Besides, this is the last Friday in the month, means its slave night," he told them. 

"Does that mean we can't get in?" Pete asked. The mixed look he returned spoke of relief not to face the unknown and frustration at driving all that way for nothing. 

The old man looked them both over. He could see that it had taken them some effort to make it this far. If he turned them away they may never come back and that would be a shame. They always needed more members and newbie's usually added a touch of excitement in the club. 

"I can sign you in as a guest. The only thing is, its slave night. You have to bring a slave, one of you willing to go for it?" he asked. He was looking at her with the assumption that Pete wouldn't be up for it, and he was right. 

Pete gave her a big wink. "You up to being my slave tonight?" he asked, with a voice that tried to sound as though it were a perfectly normal question. 

"Yes master," Josie said, while bowing and trying not to laugh. 

"Well, in you go. Masters in that door and slaves the other," he said. 

After the less than dramatic entrance they half expected to both walk through separate doors into the same place. 

Josie was expecting a cheaply decorated room, painted black for a nasty tacky dungeon look as well as to hide the dirt. She was pleasantly surprised at the lushness of the club or at least this part of it. The ceiling was ornately decorated with Victorian plaster mouldings left over from when it was probably some rich person's residence. There were several large gilt mirrors along one wall, with shelves for make-up bags. The whole room sparkled in opulent splendour. 

"Can I help you?" a woman asked. 

It was only when she stood that Josie noticed her. She was dressed in a rubber French Maids uniform that covered her entire body including fingers. She was masked with a dolls face leaving her looking unreal and just a bit creepy. Josie looked again between the apparition's legs to confirm it was a woman. 

The deep camel toe and the shape of her bottom left no doubt. If the top of the one piece outfit was real she had huge breasts too. Josie suspected they were blown up for the woman was short and the bust stuck out almost as far as she was tall. They must be J cups she thought. 

The woman laughed. "Did I startle you? I can assure you I'm a real person, not a manikin." Again the tinkling laughter rained all about her filling the room with jollity. The infectious tinkling voice left Josie wondering if the glossy wet-look outfit might have originated from her laughter alone. 

"Yes they are real," the strange maid stated. 

Josie had been caught staring so looked down only to quickly look away from the thinly covered crotch. 

The woman stood back yet her breasts were very nearly touching for they stood out so far. The woman grabbed her hands and pushed them against the big soft breasts. Josie warbled a laugh in embarrassment. The woman squashed her hands into them demonstrating they were real. 

"They're nice, lovely and, err big," Josie nervously smiled. 

"Not when I'm trying to get up their not!" she exclaimed. The woman tut her tongue and rolled her eyes in disbelief. "I'm just joking my dear. Mind you at school in Gym class it was interesting trying the high jump and skipping was farcical. The teacher was more embarrassed than me or the class. They were used to these huge things, having watched them develop over the last year of high school. The boys watched them very keenly of course. If I knew then what I do now I could have earned a fortune in pocket money," she laughed. 

"They have a lovely feel to them, so comforting," Josie commented in a hushed whisper. The nipples grew to stand out bold through the thin rubber, like great big rubber teats on a baby's bottle. Not thinking of them as real Josie tweaked one, then the other. 

She suddenly realised the woman had taken her guiding hands away yet she was still massaging the massive tits. The woman just stood there staring at her through the mask while her hands automatically squeezed and played with them. Even with both hands wrapped around one breast they were too big to envelop. 

They were absolutely fascinating, so mesmerising, and Josie couldn't stop fondling them. 

The maid was telling her about the club and for some reason she couldn't just suddenly stop as though some unspoken agreement might be broken. It was as though by continuing to massage those huge breasts she was accepting it was perfectly normal. If she let go now it might be so very embarrassing. Not knowing what to do she slowed down gradually then let go to rest her hands at her sides. 

"By the looks of things I enjoyed that much more than you did," the doll said, while looking pointedly at Josie's breasts. "You need to change for slave night but you didn't bring an outfit I take it," the doll asked with a tone of admonition. 

Josie lifted her arms and shrugged her shoulders expressing the idea she didn't care. "I guess I'm OK like this," she said. 

"The dress is cute but not suitable for tonight," she sniffed. "No need to worry sweet, you don't have to dress up like this. What kind of slave are you? You are a novice and don't know! Let me see, there's a pet, slut, doll, whore, pony, girly, bunny," she listed more but Josie couldn't follow them all. They were recited off too quickly for her to comprehend half of what was said. 

"You look confused. What does he like, plastic, cotton, PVC, rubber, leather, nylons?" 

"He bought me this dress," she said, trying to be helpful. During the day she had become used to wearing nothing but the simple cotton dress despite always wearing jeans and t-shirt. Standing close to this woman a dress felt comfortable and normal, despite the lack of underwear. 

An idea for an outfit came to her though it was such an alien thought she at first rejected it. She always thought of herself as being tough and independent, yet she had been playing around with Pete as a silly girly. Was it simply the incongruity of the image that was fun or was there something more to it than just a bit of a laugh? 

To someone else it might seem obvious but the harder she tried to think about why it attracted her, the less clear the explanation was. 

"You mentioned a girly costume? What's that like?" Josie asked. She didn't want to think about it too deeply, needing to just go with a gut feeling. 

"I'll see what I've got in your size. Here give me that dress I'll put it away safe, for when you leave," the woman told her. 

She was left with little choice as the woman swiftly pulled it up and off. Standing naked in the room with so many mirrors made her feel so self-conscious she wanted to hug her body. Not giving in to the feeling she instead watched the woman poring through a rack of fluffy clothing. A pink dress with feathery trimming was pulled out and Josie wrinkled her nose in disgust. 

The woman held it up but from across the room could tell it wasn't her size. Josie couldn't tell unless she tried to pull it on and it wouldn't fit. Dresses were as alien as space suits to her. Even at home she had never worn anything remotely feminine. If her mother had been alive perhaps she might have but her father was always too busy for such niceties. 

Josie was feeling very vulnerable standing there naked. She kept glancing at the door hoping no one would enter before she got dressed. This doll had her trapped before she had a chance to realise what was happening. She wanted to tell her to hurry up, that anything would do, yet didn't want to antagonise her for there were some very strange get-ups on the clothing racks. 

She started to feel like a foolish girly waiting to be dressed by a parent. If a crowd came in they would all dismiss her as just a silly little girl waiting to be dressed by her mom. Perhaps they might laugh at her naked embarrassment telling her there was no need to fret for she was of no interest to a man - she was just a worthless little girl. 

The image in Josie's head was a powerful one leaving her shaking. She wondered where it had sprung from but again the explanation evaded her. The doll had found something that would fit at last. 

"Are you serious? I can't go out there like this, can I?" Josie asked. A look of trepidation creased her brow and formed her lips into an attractive pout. For once she looked young and vulnerable. She was actually asking someone for advice too. 

"Best I can do on short notice. Stop fussing and prevaricating, just get out there. Your audience awaits and you don't want to keep your master waiting," the woman playfully scolded her. 

Her father hated to be kept waiting and would storm off leaving her wherever they happened to be, if she had dared to be late. The woman pushed open the door and shoved her in the back propelling her into the main room. 

Her eyes strained to become accustomed in the gloom of the low lighting. She could at least detect people weren't staring at her as though she were the freaky act. There was a satisfying low rumble of noise from people talking without an awkward silence from her sudden stumbling entrance. She noticed some weird outlines among the crowd and made out they were slaves, more strangely dressed than she was. 

"Nice! Interesting outfit," John spoke up. 

She was startled and jumped a little sensitive bunny hop revealing how jittery she was. He had been waiting for her by the door and was at her side when she tripped in. She gave him a big smile which changed to a grimace. It wasn't fair he was still dressed in jeans and t-shirt as when he entered the club. The expression lowered its ferocity to a benign acceptance. 

She was the slave and he the master. Not daring to look at her reflection there was still enough indicators to keep reminding her of that humble relationship. The leash dangling from a collar flicked against her body every time she moved. 

The soft flesh coloured spandex suit fit her so close it felt as though it would slice her in two with every movement. It fitted between her legs as closely as the doll's outfit had, leaving a deep slice between the legs. She had to admit her bottom looked good in it. Though her breasts weren't huge, like the dolls, what little she had was pushed up and straight out. 

When she saw herself in the changing room mirrors she had gasped. There was something about the outfit that shrieked out 'SEX!' come and get it. There wasn't an inch of bare flesh yet everything was on show through the thin material of the stretchy one piece bodysuit. She would have to be careful not to become excited for it would show so terribly clearly. 

Josie had always been a private person and hated anyone getting too close but with Pete all that had suddenly changed. This was just a bit too extreme though, showing off her body, no, openly flaunting it. 

Trying on a demure pose with a curtsy she offered up the leash with both hands extended out flat. 

Pete took the leash and chuckled. "You look wonderful but I know you and you're no pansy, more like a thorn bush I'd say," he told her and flicked her ass with the leash. Before she could kick him or worse he pulled on the leash heading for the bar. 

Pete had gone to the men's room leaving her standing at the bar with a drink. For a moment she forgot about the outfit as she looked around the bar and the few people there. If dressed so provocatively in a night club the boys would have been too touchy feely eliciting a sharp rebuke in the form of a swift strike. She would have floored one or more of them and been thrown out. 

The club rules forbade anyone touching a slave without the owner's permission and they kept to it. What was uncomfortable was the part about the master's permission. A master could do anything with a slave because the slave had agreed to it by signing in. It also meant a master could give permission for someone else to do what ever they liked with the slave. 

Josie looked around the bar area and grimaced. There were slaves on their hands and knees at their master's feet. One male slave was licking his mistress's boots. Pete had teased her and dared her to show herself off but nothing humiliating, just silly and exciting. 

Being given away to a man would be bad enough but submitting to a strangers quirky desires, no way! Josie didn't like the idea one bit. Had he arranged something, some kind of dare? At the front desk he had mentioned arranging something so maybe there was another challenge about to be sprung upon her. Whatever it was she had grown to trust Pete and knew he would look after her. 

What was more re-assuring was that others were dressed in less fabric than she was. There was lots of bare flesh though some were ingenious rather than rude. 

One woman was being led around the club by a chain attached to nipple rings. "Look at her, that looks so bad," Josie complained. 

"Don't look now but this one approaching the bar is even more interesting," he said. 

Josie watched as a couple passed them close. The slave was being pulled around by her clit. The slave's lips had been stretched to such an extent it left Josie feeling squeamish. 

That doll maid with the huge breasts and this slave with large dangling lips left her wondering what it was all about. Her face went blank, she was very quiet and still, except for a hand that grabbed Pete's. For once she did something about the need for someone's comfort and reassurance. 

Josie couldn't help getting her own back by drawing attention with a look and a nod to a male slave. He was being led around by a chain attached to a piercing in the end of his cock. Pete winced with a sympathetic expression of pain. 

"Nothing unusual in that, all men are led by their cocks," Josie commented. 

"For that you can get on your knees and behave like a proper slave," he demanded. 

Just about to make a snide remark she had second thoughts. He probably had something planned so it would be better not to push him into anything too outrageous. Not wanting to aggravate him she dutifully obeyed. 

It was said in good humour so why not get into the spirit of the place by joining in. The carpet was clean, thick and soft to her knees. So now she knew why the club was so plush and the floors so clean and tidy. 

Pete brought the drink to her lips and she sipped at it. He gave her a big wink emitting an infectious chuckle, letting her know it was all just a bit of fun. 

An experienced master introduced himself as Thomas and Pete bought him a drink. Pete had wanted to meet someone with experience of the scene to learn from them but wondered what to ask. 

They completely ignored Josie leaving her to think this was it. She became nervous wondering if she was up to the challenge. She squatted at their feet feeling foolish and not wanting to miss out on the conversation in case they dropped a clue to what was planned. 

Looking up at them from the floor certainly gave her a feeling of inferiority. 

A nudge to her hip whipped her head round in surprise. On all fours beside her was a pet slave. Easy to guess for the woman wore a fitted dog suit! Her breasts hung down out of it and another cut-out revealed her sex. Josie was again grateful to the doll for covering her up. Perhaps the doll had been more pleased with the breast play than she admitted. 

Josie looked at the pet pretending to pant with tongue sticking out, looking up at her master. He held her at his feet with a collar and leash. She was obviously wanting a drink and Josie realised she wasn't allowed to ask directly but had to use doggy speak. 

Again the woman vigorously wagged her tail bumping Josie's hip. Josie was exasperated over the act so pulled on Pete's jeans interrupting the conversation. "We both want a drink," she stated, with no respect at all. 

The stranger looked at her in dismay. Josie looked back at him as though she was about to stick out her tongue. Looking at dog woman it was evident she was a little disappointed with the direct approach, preferring to play the game. Of course, how stupid, the slaves are sometimes the motivating force behind the game! Pete had told her this and she had only half understood the concept until now.  

===

"What does your dog want to drink?" Pete asked, completely oblivious to the breach of protocol. 

"Bitch slave will have what it is given," the man stated coldly. He clearly thought it Pete's fault for not keeping his slave in check. "A still water is all the bitch slave deserves," he smiled. 

As practical as ever, Pete wondered if that revealed she would be the one driving home rather than putting his slave in her place. He had already told Josie not to take for granted the relationships here for often the one dressed as a slave was the one motivating the action. 

He didn't want that to happen to their relationship. He wanted to take control of her and keep it that way. They had a powerful sexual attraction cementing the relationship but needed more to keep it from going stale. He needed a key into her personality to win control of her too. 

He didn't think this Thomas was going to be much help. The woman playing at being a slave was probably his wife and they had a boring life working in an insurance office. It had been interesting watching everyone posing and playing at being master and slave but it didn't impress him much. Pete had hoped to push her into something thrilling but apart from her outfit it seemed there would be little opportunity for excitement here. 

Josie didn't like the young Asian guy. He was handsome and his slave was pretty but there was something about him she didn't feel comfortable with. Unable to talk there was little chance to find out much about the bitch. Josie almost laughed out loud at the idea of calling this attractive young woman a bitch to her face. She would have to accept it too and maybe she might lap it up. 

As though the young woman read her thoughts Josie felt an annoying nudge against her hip when the bitch began to wag her tale again. The woman moved forward a little so the tale swished her face and Josie had to duck. It was then she saw how the tail was positioned. 

'Damn!' Josie whispered. The solid end of the tail was up her rectum. She couldn't believe it and looked for some kind of support or harness for it. Taking a closer look she wondered how in hell the woman could possibly bear the indignity and pain of the horrid butt plug tail. It was creepy how the bitch could swish it around by clenching her sphincter muscles. 

Something about it frightened her. Her breathing rate increased and her attention seemed to focus on the dreadful device blocking out everything else. 

"Look how they are getting on, your pet is sniffing bitch slave's ass," Thomas laughed. 

Pete had been watching them from when he had been nudged by Thomas. If he hadn't seen it for himself he would never have believed it. If Josie was bored or too angry to play along with this game she would have let him know, like asking for a drink, she would have spoken up loud and clear. 

Was Josie telling him she was willing to try the role of pet slave? Perhaps something had been going on between the two slaves while they had been talking and he had missed it. It looked as though this visit to the club wasn't a waste of time after all. He hadn't been able to arrange anything to entertain her but it looked as though she had found something instead. 

Josie heard the comment and laughter only then realising what it must have looked like. 'Sniffing a woman's butt, indeed!' she thought, with outrage boiling inside. She wanted to grab the man by the balls to explain carefully she had just been examining the tail. Though she considered that might be the same thing from their point of view. 

She slumped further down into the lush carpet feeling stupid and unclean. Caught sniffing another woman's ass wasn't exactly a highlight of her life. What would they think if they had watched her mauling that huge pair of tits? Doll had called it breast play. Everything was just so unusual and confusing it was difficult to know how to behave in this place. 

"OK, that's a good idea," Pete said. 

"You can't take a slave with you to the office," Thomas pointed out. 

"Can I leave her, it, with you?" Pete asked. 

"Sure, it will be safe here, I'm an experienced master," he reassured Pete. 

'Noooo!' Josie thought, but couldn't get the words out before Pete interrupted. 

"I know pet, just be patient, I won't be long," he told her. "You're not going to wimp out on me are you?" he whispered. 

Josie clamped her mouth shut and slowly moved her head from side to side. This was another test of her willingness to try something new but this time felt way out of her depth. She wanted to show him how strong she was but was close to giving in. 

He lifted her chin to look into her eyes. "I won't be long and Thomas will look after you. Don't forget he is in charge so you have to do exactly as he says, or else!" Pete said. The man was experienced so it was important she did as she was told or some rule might be broken. Knowing Josie it might be someone's nose that was broken. 

She nodded slowly. The challenge had been laid firmly in her lap and she accepted it even though this was one of those rare times when she considered wimping out. Since discovering the butt plug up that stupid bitch's ass she felt weak and susceptible. She felt too weak to fight and just accepted the challenge. 

Trying to be positive she looked around at the large crowd confirming the idea of safety in numbers. He had left her to go to the restroom but now the place was full of slaves and masters. Even so, left alone would have been preferable to being left under the control of a stranger. How could he do such a thing! If the young guy tried to pin a tail on her she would punch him out. 

"Careful!" Thomas exclaimed, to someone who nearly stood on his pet. "We had better move from the bar," he muttered. Taking a hold of his pets leash he grabbed Josie's too. A small circle of space formed as the trio crawled and stepped away from the bar. 

"There's a booth over there can you crawl over to it?" he asked Josie. 

She nodded. If bloody bitch girl can so could she. Everyone was aware of crawling slaves so the path cleared quickly as they went. Only one incident halted her on a slow progress across the floor. A male slave was pulled into her path by an arrogant mistress and as Josie looked up his cock hit her in the face. 

Everyone laughed, fortunately not at her, for at that moment she was on the edge. They all laughed at the absurdity of the incident and instead of fighting she joined in the laughter. Before they could get going again Thomas bent over and asked. "What's this?" 

She felt this hand between her cheeks which changed her mood yet again. The lump she had felt earlier was pressed against her bottom and she wondered what it was. Earlier she had been getting used to the unfamiliar outfit and thought it was a seam. On hands and knees with him pushing at it she realised it was something else, something horrible. 

It was a disgusting thought that someone had left a used butt plug in the suit. "Oh! I see. It's built into the suit and you haven't fastened it properly," Thomas told her. "Here let me," he said. 

Josie felt him fiddling between the cheeks of her ass and didn't care if he was being helpful he had to stop or she would hit him. Struggling to rise off the floor he pulled on the collar bringing her to heel. 

She choked from the collar being tight and rested on all fours for a moment. She felt it then. Something had been pressing between her cheeks then suddenly popped into her asshole. It was soft and rubbery but she didn't like it one bit. 

He grabbed their leash and both slaves had to move on. She desperately wanted to stop and pull the damn thing out but he kept them going. With every movement she could feel it working upon her little brown ring. When they got to the booth she had calmed down a little. It wasn't a tail and it was fitted into the suit. He didn't know her likes and dislikes, so maybe he was being helpful. 

She wriggled her ass around a little feeling it massaging her hole. It wasn't just unpleasant it was sickening. Unprepared fro a tug on the leash she fell backward onto it feeling it pressing tight up inside. The look of horror on her face must have alerted him. 

"Are you OK? Let me have a look at it, did you lube up before putting on the suit?" he asked. 

She shook her head. The concerned look on his face left her feeling a little guilty at thinking he was a two faced shit. Even so it was time she found where Pete had got to. This damn thing had to be removed form her ass. She was beginning to panic. Before she could scramble to her feet he gripped the leash tight. 

"It's an inflatable. You had better be careful as it will inflate inside whenever you move," he told her. 

She certainly wasn't going to get up and wander off now, not with this damn thing inside her. She tried not to move at all. No wonder it felt large. It had easily slipped in feeling small and soft but was now pressing at her insides. She hated anything near her asshole and was more than a little anxious. She could handle spiders and snakes but this was the one thing she felt afraid of. 

'Damn!' she exclaimed silently. She was stuck here with this stranger hoping Pete would find her and find her quickly. It was bad enough he had pushed the damn thing up her asshole but he expected her to obey him like a slave. She looked around at the others talking and drinking, enjoying showing off their outfits and their slaves. 

She had never ever had a finger up her ass let alone an unknown object. She tried to calm herself for she might start swinging her fists. That was her usual reaction in a tight spot. This time the fight had been sucked out of her for she was too frightened to move. It felt as though she had a bomb up her ass ready to explode. 

He saw the emotion almost vibrating her body and guessed it wasn't sexual excitement. He thought it a pity for he would have liked to get her into the mood. Although she wasn't as pretty as his bitch slave she had a good figure so if the big guy didn't return to claim his slave he would take it to a private room. 

It would be interesting watching the two pets mating. Even if this slave didn't fancy such an exhibition he could rely on bitch slave to either convince it or smoothly take it by force. So this slave had the choice, either fuck his bitch slave or be fucked by it. Once bitch slave had taken it the slave would be hooked, he was sure of that. 

That's how he had tamed his bank manager. She called every Thursday evening now, desperately needing a session with his bitch slave. When he opened the door to her she crawled in grovelling, and he made her beg for it. After the corrupting session with his bitch slave the respectable married bank manager apologised, with protestations that she wouldn't be back, yet she always returned. The sex sessions, however humiliating, were like a drug that she couldn't be deprived of. 

Still holding the leash tight he smiled at the slave. "I had better take a look at it, see if I can't remove it or stop it getting any bigger," he sympathised. 

Josie didn't want to move having kept perfectly still since feeling it grow with every movement. Before she could protest he lifted her up onto the table with a strong pair of arms under her armpits. He very carefully placed her on the table and leant her back so as to get a good look at her bottom. 

"You OK?" he asked. 

She was grateful he hadn't put much pressure upon her ass as it would have inflated the dreadful thing further. She smiled at him forgetting he had pushed the damn thing into her. 

The soft little thing that had slid so easily into her asshole had grown into a hard butt plug. The incessant fear grabbed a hold of anything that might help and he was offering it. She was so pleased he was there to help her she smiled at him and whispered. "Thank you." 

He seemed to know about these things and was sure to extract it from her poor body. She smiled at him nodding her head letting him know she wanted him to continue. 

"I am a master so you should use my title, Pet," he told her firmly. 

"Yes master, thank you master," she said, pushing the words out as though they hurt. 

He spread her legs out almost straight letting her legs below the knee drape over the edge of the table. She felt the butt plug lengthen up her colon and gave out a little whimper. This was her worse nightmare. She didn't care she was in a room full of people with her legs spread, it was the feeling of her ass being filled that freaked her out. 

Her eyes were bulging and her breathing rate soared. She felt him grip the thing and turn it. The movement made the one way valve hiss, sucking in air. The rubber plug grew tighter as it expanded up her ass. 

"Do you mind if I loosen the crotch of this body stocking to get a firm grip on it," he asked. 

His face was in hers smiling at her. As he did so she became aware of his words and assented. "Please, master," she croaked, this time using the word master without reservations. 

He pulled at the fabric over her pubic mound. It looked like a seam but was just a double layer. Gripping it between his fingers he pulled. The fabric opened up with the slit travelling down over her pink curly lips. He pulled at the stretchy material so that it parted completely to expose her crotch from mons to asshole. 

"You OK?" he smiled at her. 

Josie wanted to shout at him to get the damn thing out. It was travelling up her ass with every squeeze of her butt cheeks. She sucked in a lung full of air and nodded at him to carry on. A look of suffering painted her face an ashen white. 

He looked at the curly pink fissure of her pussy. The long lips protruded hard like a little wrinkly penis. He traced her slit with a finger and looked up to see an appreciative audience. Several men and one woman were admiring her wide open thighs and all that was between them. 

The woman unconsciously licked her lips and he made a mental note to tempt her with his bitch slave next time they met. He remembered seeing her before and after a moment or two placed her. She was the Head of Imports, a section of Customs. He had dealt with her minions for his boss and seen her on several occasions. She was far too important to deal with him. 

Here in the club it was different. The woman might be tempted by the offer of licking his bitch slave or being licked by it. Perhaps both at once in a sixty- nine position might tempt her. He liked the idea of watching them licking and sucking each other but the prospect of gaining another slave was far more enthralling. 

What would the bank manager think of two women tormenting and taking her? While she was in the throws of ecstasy with bitch slave he would send another slave in to take her. A video of the prim and proper bank manger frolicking with two lovely naked women would certainly keep her in check. 

'In check,' he thought, and chuckled. The bank manager was already his to command for she was hooked on the illicit sex sessions and she suspected he had the evidence, even without him mentioning the videos. He chuckled thinking he might have this one also tamed by then. An image came to mind where his three slaves were taking turns fucking his bank manager with a dildo. 

He was brought round by a whimper from the new slave. He tickled her pussy lips which writhed like a worm on a hot pavement. This was curious. He was sure the woman had given in just because of the thing up her ass. The way she was reacting it must be a powerful phobia, like a fear of spiders. 

He knew many women didn't like it but a specific fear of being buggered by an object wasn't normal. She was happy to display her pussy in all its glory because he was about to remove the butt plug. The indignity of lying back with legs spread before everyone had simply been dismissed and overwhelmed by the phobia. 

"I'll have to take you to a private room so I can extract it. OK?" he asked. The big smile on his face was meant to be reassuring though it bordered on the victorious. 

"Please," Josie hissed on an outward breath. "Please, master, anything. I'll do anything. Help your slave master," Josie whimpered. Her voice was a whispery thin gasp. It was no longer difficult to use the word master for it was nothing compared to the fear of what was happening to her. 

Having something shoved up her ass seemed to act like kryptonite leaving her weak and compliant. As long as he kept this butt plug up her ass it seemed she was his. She had even called herself his slave! 

When he got her back to his home he would keep her ass full with one of bitch slave's big dildos to keep it quiet and obedient. An enema once a day would keep it clean. 

He pulled her legs together and she gasped feeling the devil worming its way up her back passage. Rational thought had given way completely to the irrational phobia. 

He hauled her over his shoulder and grabbed bitch slave's leash. He made slow progress through the throng while pulling at bitch slave to hurry up. Josie was moaning as though she was having an orgasm but it was a sound of distress. 

The body-suit pulled open between her legs stretched wider as they pushed through the crowd. Most took a good look and some patted her now bare ass. The slaps and each step shook her body so the rubber pumped up drilling deeper into her body, expanding and tightening as it insidiously burrowed up her back passage. 

Thomas congratulated himself for deciding to attend tonight. He had spotted a potential convert to slavery and this one was in the bag, or very nearly. He would get a large sports bag from his locker and stuff the helpless woman into it. With a gag and plastic-ties binding her he could carry the stupid woman out with no-one the wiser. She would simply disappear from the outside world, to be hidden away as one of his house slaves. 

She was small and light so would fit well in the spare cage next bitch slave. They would live until needed in the cellar he had fitted out as a dungeon. He looked forward to training the novice. It was almost a pity when they had been reduced to a servile slave. 

He thought again of the bank manager and the loan she was going to give him to start the antique import business. It would be a legitimate business but was also going to be a cover for receiving international payments. The women he trained would be sold to foreign buyers and he needed to get the payments legitimized and back into the country. 

Thomas was feeling very happy with himself. As he reached for the door handle to a private room a hand reached for his shoulder. The tight grip spun him round with Josie almost tumbling from his shoulder. 

Pete pulled her into his arms and looked into her screwed up face. It was sweaty, pale and full of anguish. "As a master you're supposed to look after a slave, that's in the club rules!" Pete told him, with anger clearly about to spill over into violence. 

"Not my slave, she's yours so you failed!" Thomas retorted. His expression seemed to say, 'you win some, you lose some'. He walked off with his bitch slave in tow, seemingly looking for another victim. 

The bastard was right though, he had failed Josie. He had told her to play along with this guy while underestimating him completely. If he hadn't seen them entering a private room he might have lost her. It was obvious what he was up to. He had already loosened the bodysuit ready to take her. 

Pete decided to use the room himself. He laid her down on the cushions and smelt her breath but she hadn't been drugged. Why the hell hadn't she hit out at him? What had that bastard done to her? He slapped her face and was gladdened to see the whites of her eyes as her eyes opened wide. 

"Master, help me!" she exclaimed. He watched her hand pull at something between the legs. 

He turned her over to discover a black rubber thing stuck to her asshole. He fiddled with it while she whimpered into the cushions. She kept pleading with him but he didn't know what she wanted or what to do.

He pushed her legs apart almost splitting her in two and heard a hiss. He looked closer to see a valve. Every time she moved it sucked in air. He pushed a finger into her wet pussy to feel the shared wall between vagina and colon. The damn thing wasn't stuck to her asshole it was up her ass. 

He tried to unscrew it until one half turn solved the mystery. The valve now acted in reverse. Air, smelly air, seeped out. Another slight turn and it whooshed out. It made a whining sound as though she were farting for her country at the wacky Olympics. 

It looked like a shrivelled condom when he pulled it from her asshole. Josie groaned as though in pain. He pulled her into his arms cradling her on his lap with little swaying motions as though rocking a baby. He whispered pleasant noises into her hair in way of comfort. Unable to see any other damage to her body he felt relieved yet still concerned. 

"What happened?" he asked. 

She moaned a little then licked her dry lips. "My bottom," she croaked. 

He managed to reach a small refrigerator for a bottle of water without letting her go. He held it to her lips feeling even more as though he was caring for a baby. He held the bottle to her lips while she sucked on the plastic nozzle. 

"That damn thing up my ass," she said. "I was so afraid. It was like a nightmare," she said, with anger in her voice. 

"A long time ago I walked in on friends of my father's while they were having sex. They didn't see me as they were going at it on the floor. She was in a doggy position and he was going at her like fury. She was growling like a she wolf. I thought he was taking her asshole but probably not," she shrugged. 

She took another feed of water before continuing. "I've always been terrified of anything or anyone touching my asshole. I've never had a finger or anything like that butt plug near me, let alone up inside," she said, and trembled violently. 

"It's only now I figured it all out. Why I'm so scared," she said. A deep sigh seemed to announce she had finished, or at least that was all she was saying for now. 

"Do you think you can get up? We should get back to the hotel, or at least get out of here," he asked. 

He helped her up and she showed signs of being sore but didn't complain. He led the way out the private room through the back door. They still had to exit the way they entered as a matter of security meant there was only one entrance and exit. Behind him she felt more able to grimace with the pain that racked her with every step. 

The old guy was asleep when they walked out into the small foyer. The door didn't creak but swung silently as they made their escape. When Pete opened the outside door she looked down at herself. She wore a skin tight flesh coloured body suit and had to walk with her thighs apart. She must look like a naked cow-girl. 

"I'll get the van, you can't walk all the way back to the hotel," Pete told her. Sit here and don't move. 

She wanted to tell him not to leave her but that would show how weak she had been and still was. She sat on steps leading up to a residential building, a tenement refurbished to become smart housing for the up and coming young professional. 

He strode off and it didn't help knowing the van was only half a block away. She wondered if she should lie in the back on the mattress he had left there from yesterday. 

"Hi, you're on my patch girl, you'll have to move on, or work for me," a young guy told her. 

Josie recognised him from earlier when they had seen him strike the begging girl. Anger flooded through her entire body from the earlier incident and what that nasty man had done to her sore bottom. The damn shit had shoved that disgusting inflatable plug up her ass and she was ready to dish out retribution. 

Rising unsteadily to her feet, it was plain from the expression on her face she was livid. Josie wanted to hit out at someone and this piece of excrement would do. She'd lost the usual carefulness, wanting to just strike out, so hadn't assessed him. The blow was delivered more slowly and with less agility too. 

He swayed back a half step and caught her arm in a lock. He slapped her face hard with the back of his hand. She pulled at her arm but he gripped it tight. 

"If you like to play rough I can take you back to my place so we can see who wins!" he flung a hard unpleasant look at her. 

Still weak from what happened in the club she slumped down with all her weight trying to pull free of him. As she brought her knee up he kicked it away and the pain stopped further retaliation. There was nothing left to free herself of the thug. For a second time this evening she had been defeated. 

The young guy gripped her hair pulling her face into his. He didn't look so young now. As he leant close the t-shirt blossomed out in front for the smell of stale sweat to escape. His breath smelled of cigarettes and beer. 

"You're not to be trusted slut. I can't leave you on the street, you're too dangerous, you maniac," he told her. "Here bitch," he said. He shook her roughly and her limbs rolled with the motion as though she were just a puppet. "Not you, slut," he warned. 

Out the corner of her eye she saw the young girl they had seen from the cafe. With his free hand he pulled the girl close to Josie. She looked eighteen going on thirty. "Take a close look at this slut. She's too wild to be on the street, doesn't know how to behave so good. She's going to work in a whore house where she can be watched. You'll follow her if you don't do as you're told," he warned the young girl. 

"I do Greg, you know I do," she wailed. 

"Don't make a fuss on the street girl," he said, with a loud tut of his tongue. 

"Look at the stupid slut. Her pussy on show for customers," he laughed a thin reedy wheeze. 

Josie could feel a cool breeze between her legs and knew the body suit had come apart again. No wonder he felt so free to treat her badly. He assumed she was an inexperienced woman desperate enough to sell her body on the streets. She was close to collapsing from the dire situation. 

"Bet that pussy of yours is well good. You know at your age what to do with it to please the customers, eh girl?" he mocked her, grinding her down. His lips were touching her ear as he taunted her. "We going to sell that virgin ass," he told her and slapped it hard. "Must be good and tight that virgin asshole. You'll get plenty of use, soon be a professional," he laughed. 

Josie had been sinking slowly to the steps as her legs gave way. He pulled her up forcibly and pushed the young girl the other side of her to grab an arm each. They were ready to march her away to a brothel. 

It wouldn't matter if she objected they would simply lock her in a room, opening it at feeding times and to let a customer in. If she was too resistant they would have to subdue her or save her for those that liked to give out rough treatment. Eventually she would give in to become a professional whore. 

The young guy straightened up holding Josie and the young girl too. A large fist swung low into his stomach catching his solar plexus. He doubled up quickly with both arms wrapping around his stomach. His knees slowly bent until he was kneeling on the concrete sidewalk, groaning in pain. 

Pete grabbed her arm swinging her toward the van parked close, with engine running. The young girl was still gripping her other arm and swung with the momentum round toward the van. A couple sidestepped them complaining then shut up to move on quickly. It was dark but they caught a closer look at the two women and the look of aggression on his face. That was enough to propel them away into the night. 

The young girl had both arms wrapped around Josie's arm not thinking of letting go. She started shouting at Pete. 

"You bastard! He'll beat me for this, he'll beat me bad. I'm not letting you steal her from Greg," she shouted. The wild young woman gripped Josie's arm all the harder, digging her nails into her arm. 

Josie just stared at her unable to do anything. Pete shovelled up the young girl in his big arms and dropped her into the van through the side door. The shouting was attracting attention and sooner or later someone with balls would intervene. Josie tumbled in after the young girl. 

"Shut her up Josie," Pete said. 

His deep clear tones reached her and Josie looked around for something. 

The girl was light from living on the streets consuming not much more than a diet of drugs and so he easily turned her over and zip-tied her wrists. When she kicked out he zip-tied her ankles then used another to make it a hog-tie. 

Josie found a pair of her panties from yesterday and stuffed them in the girl's mouth. She pulled out a roll of black tape and wrapped it around her head securing the panties. 

"It's going to be a pain getting that stuff out of her hair," Pete stated. He slid the side door open and slid it shut again on the two women. Watching for gap in the traffic he opened the driver's door and hopped in. 

Nothing was said between them but they both knew the best place would be home. An hour later they were half way there when Pete stopped for a break. He pulled the side door open as quietly as it would allow. Peering in the darkness at the two women he found them fast asleep. He couldn't see them but could hear the deep throated snores. 

He drove the rest of the way careful not to wake them. He was too exhausted to think straight. All he could think of was getting home safely. 

Pete shook Josie awake. The girl was already awake and he didn't want to make too much noise at this time of night. All they needed was for the neighbours to start twitching curtains. Seeing the girl's eyes blinking white in the darkness brought home what he had done. 

They both carried the girl in with difficulty as she struggled despite being tied up. They would have to take the gag off to feed her so the best place would be the basement. Pete rigged up a rope across one corner of the basement and dragged an old bed to it. He put a collar round her neck and attached a leash to it and the rope. 

Cutting two of the plastic zip-ties left just her arms secured behind her back. He said nothing. The situation was bad and he couldn't think what to say to improve it. Clomping up stairs to the kitchen he found Josie making coffee. When she placed a mug on the table he couldn't help noticing her hands shaking. 

"It's bad, I've fouled up this time," he said. 

"It's not your fault. Unless you arranged something with that guy," she said, looking at him so very seriously. 

He had to think what she meant. "No! The guy in the club you mean. Never spoke to him before. I just went off to get a copy of the club rules," he told her. "I meant that girl. I've kidnapped her! Damn!" 

"You saved her from that shit she was with," Josie spat. 

"Maybe, or maybe it was just to keep her quiet while I got you away from there. That guy was recovering fast. Any moment someone might have joined in on the wrong side," he said, while rubbing his bruised fist. 

This problem would take some thinking about. Report_Story
