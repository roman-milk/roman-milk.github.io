Chapter 1: Mary 

I don't know what it is with me, but I have a thing for married women. Put me in a room full of good-looking women with one of them being married and I'll home in on her every time. She wouldn't even have to be the best looking woman in the room, it wouldn't matter at all. I'd still be drawn to her like iron filings to a magnet. 

+++++ 

I hadn't been in my new job one full day when I saw a fantastic, tight little ass. It was on a woman who was bent at the waist struggling with a stuck file drawer. I had promised myself that I was going to be a good boy at this new job and stay away from the ladies for at least long enough to get my feet on the ground, but something drew me to this one and I hurried over to help her out. When I got to her I saw that my internal radar was on the money again; the woman had wedding rings on her left hand. I got the drawer open for her and introduced myself. 

I found out that her name was Sonia and that she had been with the company almost a year. She asked me if I had met many of the other people in the office I said no and then she told me that they all usually stopped for a drink after work. She suggested that if I stopped with them that night I could meet and get to know almost everyone at once. I told her that sounded like a good idea and she gave me the name of the place and told me how to get there. 

There were four men and five women from the company at the bar when I got there. I was introduced and I ordered a drink and settled in to meet my new co- workers. They seemed like a pretty decent bunch, but what registered most with me was that three of the women, including Sonia were married. 

As is the case in almost every work place there is always one guy who settles in next to you and starts to give you the low down on everybody. I found out that I should never, not ever, loan money to John or bet on anything with Harry. 

"He has all of these legitimate sounding sucker bets and he loves to catch people with them." 

I learned that Steve was an all right guy away from work, but at work was a total asshole with a penchant for taking credit for the work of others. 

"Well, that leaves you Josh, among the men that is. What is the skinny on you?" 

"Ole Josh is just an all around nice guy although I have been told that I drink a tad too much." 

"Okay, that covers the guys here, what about the ladies?" 

"I'd better tell you about Alice first since she will be the first to leave. She's engaged to be married to a stock broker and I sure hope that either the guy is very open minded or Alice is just trying to sow her wild oats before walking down the aisle." 

"A touch on the easy side?" 

"Very. There she goes now" and he pointed and I saw Alice and Steve heading for the parking lot. 

"If Steve isn't enough for her she'll be back." 

"Back seat romance?" 

"Yup." 

I filed Alice away for the future - after she got married. 

"What's the book on the redhead with the big tits?" 

"That's Betsy. Married, three kids, likes to tease, but kisses under the mistletoe at the company Christmas party is as far as she goes." 

No, I thought, I don't want to wait ten months just to get a kiss, but I did like her tits. I figured that Betsy would be the first one I would go after. 

"What about the two blondes that look like twins?" 

"The one with glasses is Mary and she's single. Most everybody thinks she is a lez. The other one is Matty and she's married, two kids, and as far as anyone knows she is a straight arrow. Last, but by no means least, there is sexy Sonia. Just recently married and the sweetest girl you would ever want to know. Now, what's your story?" 

"Not much to tell. Single, never married, and I have a hard time holding a job." 

"Why is that?" 

"I've lost my last three jobs due to outraged and jealous husbands and boyfriends. I just can't seem to leave their ladies alone. I've promised myself it is going to be different here." 

That was just so much bullshit of course, but if Josh was so open with me he would probably tell the others what he'd gotten from me and it would hurt to 'prime the pump' for the ladies. 

+++++ 

Sonia was the one I really wanted, but being newly married it would take too much time - time that would be better spent on Matty or Betsy. Apparently Josh wasted no time in spreading the word about me. The first sign that he had came three days later when everyone from work stopped for drinks again. Alice came up to me, "Hey new guy, how about a dance?" 

"Can't turn down a pretty lady, now can I?" 

We moved out onto the floor and she said, "The grapevine says that you are a bit of a "bad boy." 

"From what I've seen in here you are my female counterpart." 

"Does that give you any ideas?" 

"Not really. I've promised myself that I'm going to reform. I'm not going to lose this job for the same reason that I lost the last three." 

"I heard that it was because of jealous and irate husbands and boyfriends." 

"No, not the boyfriends, although they did squawk some, it was the husbands. Imagine getting mad just because your wife had an affair with another man. It just boggles the mind." 

"I don't get how it could cost you your job? Unless you were doing them on their desks during office hours." 

"The first one was because one of the ladies was the bosses wife. The next two were because I was a "disruptive influence in the work place." What happened at one was a couple of husbands compared notes at the company Christmas party, arrived at the same conclusion, and decided to pay me a visit. The second one was basically the same only he came after me in the office during working hours." 

"Poor baby. They hurt you bad?" 

"I survived but the jobs didn't." 

"So you are going to stay away from the married women, but the single girls are fair game, right?" 

"Mostly." 

"I'm single." 

"Yes, but you are also engaged to be married. I've promised myself no girls unless they are single and don't have a relationship with another man." 

"You might want to reconsider that position. I give great head and have a nice, tight ass." 

"I'll keep that in mind if I ever fall off the wagon." 

She gave me a smile and a look that said, "We'll see about that." 

+++++ 

I was surprised at what happened next. The following day I was sitting in the break room eating lunch when Sonia came up and asked me if she could join me. I motioned to the chair opposite and she sat down. 

"Did you know that you are the subject of almost every conversation in this place today?" 

"No I wasn't. What is it all about?" 

"You said no to Alice. No guy has ever said no to Alice." 

"She just isn't my type." 

"Oh? And just what is your type?" 

I had the feeling that though just recently married and probably not interested in me she was expecting me to flatter her by saying, "Some one like you." Instead I said, "Some one like Betsy or Matty." 

"What's so special about them?" 

"They are both married and I like ladies who are experienced." 

I could almost read her mind - "Hey! I'm married, what's wrong with me?" 

"Is that it? Just that they are married and experienced?" 

"No, being married means the odds are good that if they play around they won't be looking for any emotional entanglements. No emotional entanglements is my motto." 

"So I guess I can tell Mary not to get her hopes up?" 

She saw the expression on my face, "You have been listening to Josh?" 

"Well, yeah, he did fill me in on every one here." 

"And he told you that Mary was a lesbian, right?" 

"Yeah, he did." 

"That's probably because she hasn't dated anyone who works here and she shot him down bad last time he tried." 

"And you think she is interested in me?" 

"She can't seem to take her eyes off you when you are where she can see you." 

"Well I wouldn't rule her out, but again, I'm against emotional entanglements, especially in the work place." 

"And you don't get those with married women?" 

"No, not usually. Most married women aren't going to abandon their families over a fling. All they want is a change up from the old daily routine." 

"So who are you going after first, Betsy or Matty?" 

"Whoa up girl. I'm new here and it isn't likely that I'm going after anybody. Although Matty does have a certain appeal." 

"I thought you said that Betsy was more your type." 

"According to Jos..." 

"Hey, he was wrong about Mary." 

"You saying that if I go for it it should be Betsy? You think she would be more receptive?" 

"Good grief, how did we get on this topic anyway?" 

Just like a woman - start the conversation, steer it and then try to push it back on you. The one thing I was sure of was that everything I had said to Sonia would be known by Mary, Matty and Betsy before they went home that night. 

+++++ 

The next time we stopped after work I contented myself with watching and just sipping my beer. Alice made a trip to the parking lot with Josh, came back in and an hour later went out to the lot again with John. Sonia came over and sat down with me and saw me watching Alice and John. 

"That could have been you if you weren't so picky." 

I shrugged and said, "I am what I am." 

"I played some slow songs on the jukebox; come and dance with me" and she took my hand and pulled me out of my chair. Sonia was a very nice armful and she surprised me by moving in close. The result was predictable and when my hard cock poked into her leg she drew back, looked at me, and then moved in close again. Over her shoulder I saw both Matty and Betsy watching us and I wondered if it were just coincidence. I danced two slow songs with Sonia and then we went back to the table. Just before she sat down she kissed my cheek and said, "Thanks for the compliment." Matty and Betsy heard her and I saw them exchange a quick glance. 

+++++ 

A week went by before I stopped after work for drinks again. During that week, with the exception of Alice, the other four women were constantly stopping by my cubicle during work or joining me on coffee breaks or during lunch. It was just social calls on the parts of Mary, Matty and Betsy although it did seem they were a lot more sociable since I'd had my talk with Sonia. Sonia's visits seemed to be more along the lines of sounding me out on Mary, Matty and Betsy and to keep me up to date on office gossip. 

That night at the bar I settled in to sip my beer, watch and formulate a plan on making my first serious attempt to score one of the ladies. I'd no sooner taken my seat than Matty came over and asked me to dance. I was surprised when she moved in close and even more surprised when she said, "A little birdie tells me that you lost your last job because you liked to play around with married women. True?" 

"Are you asking as a married women who likes to play around or just out of idle curiosity?" 

She stepped back, looked at me and then moved back in close. "That was an oopsy, wasn't it? No matter what my answer is to your question I have planted a seed, haven't I?" 

"I guess it would be safe to say that your question has sparked my curiosity, but the answer to your first question is yes, it is true." 

"Why?" 

"Because most married women are safe," 

"How is that?" 

"Mostly they are looking to take a break from the day to day monotony of their lives and they are not interested in anything long term." 

"And you are not a long term kind of guy?" 

"No I'm not." 

"Interesting" she said as the music stopped and we walked back to join the others. 

+++++ 

I was on my third beer when Betsy came over and grabbed my hand and pulled me up out of my chair and led me to the dance floor. Not one word, just grab and go. As soon as we were on the floor I asked, "And to what do I owe the honor?" 

"I'm interested in you and it didn't look like you were ever going to ask me to dance so I came and got you." 

"You, a married woman, interested in me? Pray tell why?" 

"It's a girl thing. From what I hear you have a reputation and to a girl that is like being a magnet. We just have to find out if it is true." 

"I'll tell you my story if you'll tell me yours. The book on you is that you love to tease the boys, get them all horny, and then run away laughing." 

"True to some degree, but also false to some degree." 

"You going to explain that?" 

"I leave them horny, but I don't tease and run away laughing. I can't help it that my body turns guys on and that once they get turned on they think it is up to me to take care of their problem. I don't run away laughing, I just leave them with their problem." 

"Okay. My story is that I love the ladies. The ladies I happen to love usually belong to someone else. And, as for your body creating problems - it has - and you might want to consider not dancing so close to me." 

She cocked her head to the side, "Most men would have done the opposite and pulled me closer." 

"I'm not most men. Besides, I'm trying to behave. I don't need to lose this job the way I lost the last three." 

"You might not have a choice in whether or not you get to behave." 

"Why is that?" 

"Word is that a couple of girls at work have their eye on you." 

The music stopped and we went back to the table 

+++++ 

A half-hour passed by and I noticed that no one had asked Mary to dance that evening so the next time the music started I asked her. 

"I'm surprised," she said as I took her in my arms. "Office rumor has it that you only go for the married women." 

"Is office rumor always true?" 

"Well, since you came to work with us you turned down a sure thing in Alice and you have only danced with married women." 

"Office rumor has it that you are a lesbian. Does that make it true?" 

"You have been talking to Josh I take it." 

I shrugged. 

"Anything you get from Josh should be taken with a grain of salt. I've not dated anyone from the office because with the exception of Josh they are all married. I've not dated Josh because I just don't want to and so to him I guess that means I'm gay." 

"Want to prove him wrong and at the same time show that office rumors aren't worth beans?" 

"How do I do that?" 

"Dinner and dancing tomorrow? 

"Sure, why not." 

+++++ 

"You certainly have a flair for stirring the pot." 

Sonia had come into my cubicle and had sat down on the edge of my desk. "How so?" I asked. 

"Mary told every one that the two of you are going out on a date tonight, true?" 

"Yes indeed, why?" 

"Because now Matty and Betsy are pissed at her. It seems that the two of them have an interest in you and since your stated preference is married women they thought you were theirs." 

"How would they know my preferences?" 

"Why sweetie, I told them of course. Don't you know that for a woman the only thing that takes precedence over shopping is gossip?" 

"That means that you are the one stirring the pot, not me." 

"True, but I couldn't do it without you." 

"Okay then, if it is a game what am I supposed to do next?" 

"Doesn't matter. I can work with whatever you do." 

"For a newly married innocent young housewife you certainly have an evil streak." 

"You got it mostly right." 

"What?" 

"What you said. You had it right except for the innocent part." 

She got up and walked away leaving me staring at her back and wondering. 

+++++ 

My date with Mary did not go at all the way I expected. Dinner was fine, the conversation witty and scintillating and the dancing was close and at times erotic. The surprise came when I took her home. I walked her to her door, told her that I'd had a nice time and that I hoped that we could do it again. 

"Are you saying that the night is over?" 

"Are you saying that it isn't?" 

She grabbed my tie and pulled me down and kissed me. When she broke the kiss she said, "Wasn't part of this date supposed to be showing that I'm not a lesbian? Well you can't prove it out here on the front porch." 

She turned, unlocked and then opened her door, stepped inside and then turned and waited to see what I would do. 

Mary was not a lesbian! 

Mary might have been bisexual, but she was not a lesbian. She led me to her living room couch and had me sit down and then she knelt in front of me, unzipped my fly and then worked my rapidly hardening cock out into the open. She looked up at me and smiled as she stroked me until she got a drop of pre- cum in my pee hole and then she bent her head and licked it up. Her hands let go of my cock and moved down to caress my balls as her mouth swallowed me and the she sucked my cock like a wanton whore. It had been months since my last woman and Mary had me ready to explode in a very short time and I let her know that I was going to shoot and all she did was clamp her mouth tight around me and bob her head faster with the predictable results. She kept licking and sucking on me until I was totally limp. 

"I like to get the first one out of the way. It makes the second one last a lot longer. Want to see my bedroom?" 

After a strenuous romp followed by some very good sixty-nine and another strenuous romp Mary asked, "So, who are you going after first?" 

"I don't know what you mean." 

"Yes you do sweetie. You are going after the married women. I'm strictly window dressing, something to fire them up, to piss them off. Each one of them wanted to be the first one you hit on and you know it. But I think you felt that you needed to do something to make one of them make the first move. From what Sonia tells everybody you have a major thing for married women so I'm your first and not them. Now they are thinking, "He's got a thing for married women, but he goes after Mary instead of me. Why did he go after a single girl instead of me? Is something wrong with me? Well damn it, there isn't! I'll show him." All I was supposed to be was a dinner date to stir them up and you hadn't planned on my dragging you inside. Have I got it right?" 

I leaned on an elbow and looked down at her, "You give me way too much credit for deviousness, but I do like the way you think." 

"So which one do we go after first?" 

"We?" 

"Absolutely sweetie. I'm having fun tonight and I want to do it again. So I'm going to help you get all three of them and the price for that help is more of what we are doing tonight." 

"Three of them? I was only looking at Matty and Betsy." 

"Sonia wants you sweetie. It is killing her that you haven't taken a shot at her all ready. If I had to make a bet on it I'd bet that she'll be the first one to make a "come on" type gesture when I spread the word about what a great fuck you are." 

"You think so?" 

"Depends on you sweetie, do we have a deal?" 

"I'd be silly to say no." 

"Back to my question then. Who do you want first? That is who I'll tell about my fantastic night with you." 

"Which isn't over yet?" 

"God I hope not." 

"Then why not tell them all." 

To be continued...

Chapter 2: The Plan 

The plan was for Mary to tell Matty, Betsy and Sonia about our evening together and then let slip some of the "pillow talk" we'd had. She would tell them that we had parted friends because while we had had a good time we really hadn't 'clicked.' She would tell them that I had let it slip (reinforcing what Sonia had been telling them) that what I really wanted for a relationship was a married woman who was happy with her marriage overall, but just wanted to have a fling. 

Mary would tell them that I'd told her about one who lived in my apartment complex that I had my eye on and that I had hopes of scoring with her and settling into a relationship. The idea was to make the three think, "Why the woman in the apartment? What's wrong with me?" 

+++++ 

I was glad that I hadn't bet with Mary on whether or not Sonia would be the first one to make a move. Wednesday morning Mary and the girls 'gossiped' during the morning coffee break and ten minutes after it was over Sonia was perched on the end of my desk. 

"Hear you made a conquest last night." 

"And I thought it was only guys who kissed and told." 

"I told you sweetie, gossip is a woman's life blood. You stopping at the bar tonight?" 

"Probably, why?" 

"Just save the first dance for me, okay?" 

As she walked out of my cubicle I saw Matty at the water cooler and the look she gave Sonia could have killed. That night at the bar was almost funny. I'd no sooner sat down when Matty came over and took the seat next to me and she wasn't in her seat ten seconds when Betsy came and took the chair on the other side of me. Before her butt hit the chair Sonia was there to remind me that I had promised to save the first dance for her. I got up and moved out onto the floor with her and she moved in close. 

"Can I ask you a personal question?" 

"Depends on what it is. I may answer it or I may not." 

"When we talked that first time in the cafeteria, you know, when we talked about your turning down Alice?" 

I nodded that I remembered and she went on, "When I asked you just what your type was you said someone like Matty or Betsy because they were married and therefore you considered them safe. I'm married. Why didn't you say "someone like you?" 

"Probably because you are newly married and I wouldn't expect a newly married woman to have reached the point yet where she was ready for a fling, especially with a 'bad boy' like me." 

"Well you're wrong. It's the bad boy image that has me interested." 

"You can't be serious." 

"Why not? Forget all that sweet, young and innocent crap. I'm none of that. What I am is inexperienced and I think I got married too quick. I should have seen and experienced a little more of what is out there before I tied myself down. And then you come along and you are looking for fun with no commitment. Why shouldn't I jump at the chance?" 

"You know what you are saying?" 

"Of course I do." 

"I don't think that you do. We aren't talking about a quick trip to the parking lot. I use real beds. That means sneaking away to meet me. Can you handle that? Can you get away to meet me and spend four or five hours with me without causing your husband to become suspicious? I'm not into 'wham bam' honey. I take my time and do it right. Think about that for a bit." 

"I don't have to. My husband works afternoons and as long as I get home before he does I won't have a problem. He already knows I stop here with the people from work two or three nights a week so we just don't come to the bar on those nights - we go straight to your place." 

"You're sure about this?" 

"Yes I am." 

"Tomorrow night after work?" 

"Yes." 

The music had stopped and we walked back to the table and I saw Matty looking at us with an unreadable expression on her face. 

+++++ 

Matty got up from her seat and went over to the jukebox and fed some quarters into it. I managed to get one sip of my beer by the time the music started and Betsy walked up and said, "My turn" and then she led me out to the dance floor while Matty threw murderous looks at her. As we started dancing I said, "I think you just upset Matty. I think she put the money in the box expecting to be the one out here with me." 

"Screw her. You ever hear the expression, "You snooze, you lose?" I'm a firm believer of 'first come, first served' and I'm here first." 

"You want to spell that out for me?" 

"You know the woman that you described to Sonia? Married and with no interest in breaking up her family, but wanting a change from the daily routine?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"Well that's me. I want just what you say that you are looking for, a fling with no emotional involvement. Just have some fun for a while and then go on home." 

"What's your idea of for a while?" 

"A couple of times every couple of weeks for a couple of months or longer or less depending." 

"Depending on what?" 

"Whether we click or not." 

"You sure about this?" 

"I haven't thought of anything else for a week now." 

"How do you see it happening?" 

"My husband bowls on Tuesdays and has a lodge meeting on Thursdays. I have until eleven on Tuesdays and till one or so on Thursday." 

"I promised myself that I was going to be good when I started this job, but I can't look a gift horse in the mouth. This week is out, but if you are certain that you want to do this I guess we can give it a try next Tuesday. You going to go and tell the others now?" 

"Oh no. Nobody needs to know except you and me. They can suspect all they want, but no one needs to know." 

We talked a little more and then when the music stopped we went back to the table. Betsy grabbed her purse and got out some change and said, "I'll go and feed the jukebox" and she gave Matty a look that said, "Nah nah na nah nah." 

+++++ 

The first song that played was a fast one and when Matty asked me to dance I told her that I'd love to, but that I wanted to wait for a slow tune. As I sipped my beer Matty looked from me to Betsy, who was talking with Steve and Alice, and the back at me. 

"Did she get to you?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"The bitch knew I was going to try and get something going with you tonight and it was driving her crazy that I might actually manage it. Ever since middle school she has made it her goal in life to beat me at damn near everything." 

"Has she?" 

"No, I win some, she wins some." 

"Why? What's the reason for her wanting to beat you?" 

"It goes back to the very first school dance we were old enough to attend. Betsy had a crush on Ronnie Crew, but he ignored her and danced with me most of the night. Since then it has been pretty much open warfare between us." 

"Is that what this is all about? Beating Betsy? You knew she was going to try and so you had to try too?" 

"That's part of it." 

"What's the rest?" 

"My husband has been having an affair with his secretary. I found out about it a month ago and I decided that if he could, I could, and then you showed up." 

"So, this is about revenge." 

"No, it would be revenge if I let him know and then rubbed his nose in it. No, this is more than that. I've wanted to try some one else for the last couple of years, but I didn't because I didn't want to take a chance on ruining the family if I got caught. Now I have an out. If he finds out I can say, "So what? I'm just doing what you are doing with your secretary" and then see where things will go. So, did Betsy beat me again?" 

"Depends on your definition. She got to me first and I'm going to see her on Tuesday, but I have Monday open." 

"Can we be wicked on Monday?" 

+++++ 

The last person I danced with that night was Mary. 

"How are we doing?" 

"I don't know what you told them, but all three of them came after me tonight." 

"I just told them that you were a great lay. So which one got lucky?" 

Sonia tomorrow, Matty on Monday and Betsy on Tuesday." 

"You dog you. Does that mean I get you tonight or are you going for Alice so you can say you've had everyone in the office?" 

"No, not Alice. Alice is a little too indiscriminate for me. We know what she does when she's here with us and we take it on trust that no one in this office has a social disease, but we have no idea what she does on other nights. If she is doing the same thing at some other place God only knows what she might have picked up. I want to be known as a spreader of joy, not the clap." 

"Don't be so hard on the girl; she's not that bad." 

"We don't know that, at least not for sure." 

"But you would do her if you could be sure?" 

"What is it with you? Why is it so important to you that I get all of them?" 

"Just want you to get it all out of your system sweetie. Once you get the distraction of them out of the way you can concentrate on me." 

"That sounds suspiciously like you want to develop the kind of relationship that I try to avoid; the very reason, in fact, that I concentrate on married ladies." 

"A girls got to try. Now, do I get tonight or not and what about the weekend?" 

+++++ 

Mary followed me to my apartment and spent almost all night trying to ruin me. She started out with another of her superb blow jobs and then she climbed up on the bed, got on her knees and buried her head in a pillow and invited me to take her in the ass. She was hot and tight and she loved anal sex. By the time I was ready to cum she was begging me not to stop, but I had no choice in the matter. I stopped stroking into her, but my cock shot its load anyway. I hurried into the bathroom and washed my dick off and then ran back and got into a sixty-nine and tried to get her off. I got her close, but couldn't bring her all the way and as soon as she got my dick hard again she wanted me back in her ass. Before I fell asleep she had given me two marvelous blow jobs, had taken me in her ass three times and had climbed on top of me and pounded her pussy on my cock once. 

She woke me up with a blow job, climbed on top of my for a slow leisurely fuck and when she left me to go home and get ready for work I wondered if I would be able to do Sonia any good when we got together that night.  

===

Chapter 3: Sonia 

The atmosphere in the office the next day was a little chilly as far as the women were concerned. They all seemed to be stepping lightly around each other. Most of them were ignoring Mary because she was walking around with a smug expression on her face. Matty and Betsy kept shooting daggers at each other as they eyed each other across the office. For the first time in over a week I didn't get a morning visit from Sonia, probably because she knew she had a lock on being the first married woman to get to my bed. The only woman in the office who was acting normal was Alice. 

+++++ 

This was a brand new experience for me. I'd had problems at my last three jobs because of my penchant for married women, but all those problems had come from husbands and boyfriends. This was the first time that I had stirred up the women themselves. It was also the first time in my life that I was the subject of a competition, the first time I didn't have to work at seducing the women I was after. And to be honest I wasn't at all sure that I liked it that way - the thrill of the chase was gone. 

The day passed pretty much without incident except that once, when Betsy had walked past Matty's desk, I heard Matty mutter "Bitch!" At three-thirty Sonia stopped by my desk and asked, "Are we still on?" 

"You are the only one who can call it off." 

"Should we go in one car or should I follow you?" 

"You follow me in your car. That way if you decide at the last minute to bail out you can just keep on driving." 

"You keep saying that. Why are you expecting me to back out?" 

"Sweetie, I've been here before - lots of times - but this is new to you. It wouldn't be the first time that a woman decided at the last second that it wasn't worth taking the chance." 

"What chance? As long as I'm careful everything will be fine." 

"Still, you follow, and I really do hope that you will be behind me when I get out of my car at the apartment." 

After Sonia had walked away Matty got up from her desk and walked over to me. Looking at Sonia moving down the hallway Matty said, "I'm not going to be first, am I?" 

"What makes you say that?" 

"Sonia's body language." 

"I think you are imaging things." 

"Doubt it all you want honey, but a woman can tell about these things." 

"I didn't know that it was important for you to be first; I thought all you wanted was to beat Betsy?" 

"That too, but it is an ego thing. What girl in a competition doesn't want to be the winner?" 

"Funny, I don't get that feeling from the others." 

"Maybe not, but it is there." 

"Would you sleep better if you were the first?" 

"Christ no. I probably wouldn't sleep at all. I'd be so turned on that I'd make love to my husband all night long." 

"Is it really that important to you?" 

"I'll live. At least I'll beat Betsy." 

It wasn't on my program for the day, but I do like to keep the ladies happy and so I asked, "Can you keep your mouth shut? I know that you will rub it in when you beat Betsy, but can you keep quiet about anything else that happens?" 

"Yeah, I could." 

"Meet me in the supply closet in five minutes. It will be a no frills quickie, but you would be the first and I wouldn't want anyone else to know about it." 

"Five minutes?" 

"Five minutes." 

"No one will ever hear of it from me." 

"That's all I want." 

When I walked into the supply closet five minutes later I found Matty standing there with her panties in her hand. 

"I was afraid you were joking with me," she said. 

"I never kid around when it comes to married pussy. Turn around, bend down and get a good grip on the shelf," I said as I opened my fly and took out my cock. Matty looked at it and licked her lips nervously. 

"Change your mind?" 

"No, no I'm not. It's just that I have never done anything like this before and it's happening so fast." 

"That's the idea Matty, it has to be fast. We need to get it done before we get caught. It is your choice sweetie, but you need to hurry up and make it." 

She looked nervously at me, down at my cock, back up at my face and then she choked out, "Oh God" and she turned, bent at the waist and moaned, "Hurry, please hurry and do it before I run." 

I stepped forward and as I did I said, "Reach between your legs and pull the folds of your pussy apart for me." 

She spread her legs and did as I asked as she kept moaning, "Oh God, hurry, please hurry." 

It was a quick and almost brutal fuck. She wasn't very wet and we spent no time at all on foreplay because time was of the essence. What we were doing was dangerous - some one could come looking for copy paper or an ink cartridge at any time and the locked door would be a red flag. 

Matty gave out a loud grunt as I pushed into her. It took four strokes to get me in deep enough that I wouldn't fall out on the backstroke and then I started banging away. Matty braced herself against the shelf and moaned as I drove myself into her. Four minutes of banging hard and I was ready to let loose, but before I could ask her if she wanted me to pull out she cried out, "Oh sweet fucking Jesus" and shoved herself back at me and that was all it took for me to blow my nuts. 

I pulled my semi-hard cock out of Matty and was tucking it away as I said, "I'll go first and if no one is looking this way I'll knock once and you can come out. If you don't hear a knock just stay in here for about five minutes and then come out with an ink cartridge or some thing." There was a long silence and I said, "Are you all right?" 

She turned to face me and there were tears streaming down her face. "No, I'm not all right. I've just been unfaithful to my husband for the first time and I loved it. I had an orgasm. The first orgasm of my life and I have it cheating on my husband." 

There were a couple of things that I could have said, but they would have come across as glib and insensitive so I kept my mouth shut and left the supply room. No one was around so I knocked once and went back to my desk. Five minutes later Matty was back at her desk, but her eyes avoided mine for the rest of the afternoon. 

+++++ 

Sonia was waiting in her car when I left the building and she was right behind me when I pulled out of the parking lot. As I drove toward my apartment I wondered if she would still be with me when I got there and I also wondered if I would be good company if she was. Contrary to popular opinion I was not an insensitive brute. I love loving the ladies and I'd never had one act the way Matty had when we finished. I'd always left my ladies with a smile on their face - never tears - and Matty's actions upset me somehow. I just hoped that the mood I was in driving home didn't carry over into my evening with Sonia. 

I needn't have worried; Sonia was still behind me when I pulled up at my apartment and her actions caused my mood to change almost immediately. She started by walking up to me and handing me her thong. 

"You will no doubt notice that the first three buttons on my blouse are undone. That, and the thong, should indicate to you that there isn't going to be any backing down on my part." 

I grinned at her, "Even if you did I wouldn't give this back" and I dangled the thong in front of her." 

Once inside my apartment Sonia asked me where the bedroom was and I pointed it out to her. She smiled at me and then headed for it undressing as she went. When she got to the door she looked back and saw me standing there watching. "You do plan on joining me, don't you?" 

When I joined her on the bed I moved to take her in my arms, but she pushed me away. "I'm not here for a love affair sweetie, I'm just here to satisfy sexual curiosity." 

That Sonia wasn't the sweet, young innocent newly wed that I'd thought she was became apparent when she said, "I get all the hugs, kisses and cuddling I need from my husband. I'm here for some cock lover. I haven't thought of anything but this all day and I'm so wet and horny that you should slide right in with no trouble." 

She was right and I sank into her hot box with one push. Her legs came up and locked around me and she moaned in my ear, "Fuck me hard and make me cum lover. Just fuck my brains out" and she pushed her pussy up at me. 

It was a rather strenuous romp and when it was over and I had caught my breath I asked her to be a little more specific in what she was after. 

"I didn't detect a whole lot of inexperience in what we just did. Just what is it that you are looking for?" 

"Cock! I want cock in my mouth, cock in my hands and cock in my ass. I don't really need it in my pussy, but I can't very well come into your bedroom and tell you that all you can do is have me anally or let me suck your cock." 

"Do I get an explanation?" 

"I walked proudly down the aisle in my pure white wedding dress knowing that I was going to my husband as an absolute virgin. I'd had miles of tongue down my throat and my tits had been squeezed until they had bruises. I'd even let myself be fingered a time or two, but no part of me had ever touched a cock. My husband was going to get my first hand job, my first blow job and both of my cherries - anal and vaginal. What's more, I was looking forward to giving him all of that with eager anticipation." 

"I can tell from the tone of your voice that what you are telling me has a touch of sarcasm and a smidgen of disappointment." 

"You got it lover. My husband loves to fuck and he is after me damned near 24/ 7 and he happens to have a good sized cock and he's pretty good at giving me screaming orgasms." 

"But?" 

"Yeah lover, but! According to my husband oral sex is totally disgusting and anal sex is for degenerate perverts. The problem is that I had been looking forward to the two things he won't even talk about. Then you come along with your "bad boy" reputation and I see my opportunity to experience what Ronnie won't give me and at the same time I can see what another cock is like." 

"So basically, all I am to you is a sex toy?" 

"Yeah, right!" 

"So, what do you want first, anal or oral? And if it is oral, do you want to give or receive?" 

"I'm putting myself in your capable hands." 

"Okay then, how about this? I'll go down on you and see if maybe, just maybe I can get you off by eating your pussy. By then I should be hard again and you can suck my cock for a while and then we can do some anal after which we will go into the bathroom and you can wash my cock and then suck me until I get hard. After that it will be up to you where you want me to put that hard on. That sound okay to you?" 

"Okay, up to a point. The question is can you get hard two more times before I have to leave?" 

"It is possible, why?" 

"Because when I suck your cock I'm going all the way. I want to know what it feels like to have your cum slide down my throat. So you will need to get hard again after that, won't you?" 

+++++ 

There is nothing in the world that, at least to a cock hound like me, can match the taste of a sexy woman that you have just fucked. Sonia leaned back, spread her legs and watched as I went down on her. Two minutes into it I had her moaning out, "Oh yes" and "there, right there, oh god that's good." My goal was to get her off with my mouth and I had no idea if I could be successful at that or not. So women just can't be brought off orally and I was hoping that Sonia was not one of them. I wanted to give her the complete experience because I had the feeling that once Sonia had experienced the two things she wanted to try I would never have the pleasure again. 

I got her close, but I never got her off. I got her to where she had her fingers wrapped in my hair and was pulling me against her muff like she was trying to pull me inside her, but I just couldn't get her to cum. Finally I had to stop because my head hurt from the hair pulling and my cock was throbbing and needed some attention. 

I sat on the side of the bed and she got down on her knees and took my cock in her hand. She looked up at me and said, "Tell me if I start to do something wrong. Don't forget I'm brand spanking new at this." 

For some one brand knew she was pretty damned good. She licked the pre-cum from the cock head and then she started licking it like an all-day sucker. She licked down the bottom side until she got to my balls and then she gently gave each one a suck. She licked her way up the topside until she got back to the helmet and then she swirled her tongue around the cock head before tentatively taking the cock in her mouth. She started to reach with her hand and I said, "No hands baby. Just use your mouth. Increase pressure or decrease pressure using your lips, but a great blow job doesn't have any hand work involve at all except for playing with the balls." 

Her hands dutifully went to my balls and she gently played with them while her head bobbed up and down on my shaft. Because my cock had been throbbing when I was eating her pussy I didn't last as long as I would have liked to. When I felt the time approaching I said, "I'm going to cum baby, I'm going to cum, get ready, get ready for it" and then I blew. I half expected that she would jerk her mouth off me, but she didn't. What she did was pull her mouth back to the cock head and clamp her lips tight as she brought a hand up and jacked me off to milk the last little bit of cum out of me. 

I was sitting there, a contented smile on my face, when I heard her make a gagging sound and I looked as she got up and ran for the bathroom. The next thing I heard was her tossing her cookies into the toilet. She was in the bathroom a good five minutes and I heard the retching noises she made. When she did finally come out she went right for her clothes. I watched as she dressed, but Sonia wouldn't meet my eyes. I was at a loss as to what to say. 

It was a brand new experience for me; a woman had never before bolted for the bathroom and then barfed in the toilet after sucking me off. It was a day of firsts for me; I'd never had a woman cry because I'd given her an orgasm either. As I watched Sonia dress I wondered what the protocol was in saying goodnight - or was it goodbye - to a woman you had just caused to throw up into your toilet. Sonia saved me from the embarrassment of doing the wrong thing by looking over at me and saying, "I'll let my self out" and then she left. 

My insensitive side said, "Oh well, one down and two to go," but my sensitive side was upset - very upset - at the way the evening had ended. Sonia was a damned good piece of ass and I would have loved to have more of her.

Chapter 4: Matty 

The next day at work one of the first people I saw was Sonia and as our eyes met she quickly looked away. Around nine Mary came over and sat down on the edge of my desk. 

"So, how did it go last night?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean how did your evening with Sonia go?" 

"It was okay." 

"Just okay?" 

"Hey, what can I say. Sometimes things just don't click." 

"She wasn't any good in the sack huh?" 

"No, that wasn't it at all. We both enjoyed it, but I doubt that we will be getting together again. It's like I said, we just didn't click." 

"Good." 

"Good?" 

"Yeah. I've seen the way you look at her and I was afraid that you would get too involved and that would cut into my action. Since you didn't click can I take that to mean that you are free tonight?" 

"Yeah, I guess so." 

"What a coincidence, so am I. How about we wake up together tomorrow morning and see if we can't find something to do that will keep us busy the rest of the weekend?" 

+++++ 

I've spent a ton of time chasing the ladies and I've probably bedded more than my fair share, but I am by no means a sexual athlete. I'm just a fairly decent looking average guy who is luckier than other fairly decent looking average guys, so I'm afraid that I must have disappointed Mary when after the fourteenth romp (four Friday night, six on Saturday and Saturday night and four on Sunday) I was completely unable to generate another hard on. In fact, it took almost super-human effort on my part to get it up for the last two on Sunday. Rather than admit my inadequacies I pushed Mary away and told her that I needed to build up my strength for my date with Matty on Monday night. 

Of course there might not be a date with Matty on Monday since I had no idea of what the outcome of our visit to the supply closet would be. At the time it had seemed to me that she was pretty broken up over the fact that she had been unfaithful. I guessed that it would just have to be a case of wait and see. 

+++++ 

Monday started out bad. Neither Matty or Sonia would make eye contact with me and I started thinking that I was going to get a night of rest. That idea disappeared at lunch. I was sitting at a table in the employee lunchroom eating my lunch when Matty came in and sat down with me. She opened her lunch bag and as she took out a container of yogurt she said matter of factly, "I'm leaving work early today so I'll need directions on how to get to your place." 

I don't know what she saw, but she said, "What? You thought I was kidding?" 

"No, but after what happened in the supply room I had the feeling that you might have changed your mind." 

"I did get a little weepy didn't I? But no, I'm not calling it off. I still want to beat Betsy, but more important to me now is getting even with my husband. I not only need to get even with him for fooling around with his secretary, but now I need to get back at him for never, not once, in eight years of marriage, giving me an orgasm. What he didn't do in eight years you did in three minutes. I liked the feeling and I want to feel it again." 

"You are sure about this?" 

"Honey, I'm absolutely dead sure." 

I gave Matty directions to my apartment, finished my lunch and got back to work. Matty was waiting in the parking lot when I got home from work. She got out of her car with a couple of shopping bags and followed me into my apartment and then asked me where the bathroom was. I pointed it out and she and her shopping bags disappeared inside. Five minutes later she came out. She was wearing nylons, a garter belt, crotchless panties, a cut a way bra and Come Fuck Me pumps with four or five inch heels. She smiled at me and struck a pose. 

"What do you think? I bought this stuff just for the occasion. Is this suitable attire for a woman who is intent on making her husband a cuckold? 

She didn't really have to ask that question because I knew she could see me drooling. And since I had undressed while she was in the bathroom she could also see visual proof in the hard on she had caused. 

She giggled and said, "I think he likes me." She walked over to me and put her arms around my neck and said, "We didn't take the time to do this the other day," and then pulled my face down to hers and gave me a kiss that curled my toes. She slid her tongue into my mouth as one hand reached down and began to stroke my hard cock. My hands moved to her exposed nipples and I rolled them between my thumb and forefingers and she moaned, broke the kiss and went to her knees in front of me. Her hot mouth closed on my cock and it didn't take me long to realize that Matty's husband was an idiot if he was out playing around when he had something like Matty at home. Matty deep throated me until I was ready to blow and I told her I was going to cum. She grabbed my ass with both hands and pulled me as deep into her mouth as she could take me and held me there until I came. She took my load down her throat and when I was limp she let my cock fall from her mouth and then licked it and my balls until she was satisfied that she had gotten all of my juice and then she looked up at me and smiled. 

"What next?" 

I picked her up and carried her into the bedroom, set her down on the bed and then I ate her pussy until I was hard again. When I moved between her legs to mount her I intended to go slow and have a leisurely fuck to make up for the wham bam thank you mam that we'd had in the closet, but Matty wasn't having any of that. She locked her legs around me and started begging me to fuck her harder, to fuck her faster and to make her cum. 

What with her superb blow job and all the sex I'd had with Mary over the weekend I knew that it would be a while before I was going to be able to squirt again. There wasn't any way that I could sustain high speed and hard fucking for the eight or ten minutes that it was going to take me so I did what I thought might keep her happy. I alternated bursts of hard and furious fucking with periods of slow and leisurely. It took me fourteen minutes to get myself off and during that period Matty had three orgasms that I was aware of. When it was over I asked Matty how long we had before she had to leave. 

"I'm here until you tell me to leave sugar. Dean thinks that I'm at my sister's place and I've been known to spend the night when I go see her. My sister and Dean hate each other so there won't be any phone calls to check up on me. Even if Dean did call my sister would just hang up on him." 

"Does she know what you are doing?" 

"She has been after me to do it for months, ever since I told her about Dean and his secretary." 

After some rest Matty and I went sixty-nine and then we had another really hard fuck after which we fell asleep together. When the clock went off I rolled over and looked at the still sleeping woman and thought for the tenth time that night that her husband was one ignorant asshole. She started to stir and I pushed her legs apart and got down and ate her pussy until she was awake and then we fucked one more time before getting out of bed and getting ready for work. 

We were sipping coffee at the kitchen table when Matty said, "This cheating business is a blast. How often can I go visit my sister?" 

"I do have some other commitments right now so how about twice a week until I see how things go?" 

"Thursday work for you?" 

Remembering that Betsy had told me that Tuesday and Thursday were the nights she could get away I said, "No, but Wednesday or Friday would." 

"Can I have them both?" 

"Can you get away that much without your husband getting suspicious?" 

"I already told you that I don't care if he finds out. It's you that I'm worried about." 

"Me? Why me?" 

"I have no idea how well you are going to hold up with all the girls after you and I want to get as much as I can before the five of us fuck you into an early grave." 

"The five of you?" 

"Betsy, Mary, Sonia, Alice and me." 

"I don't think Sonia is interested anymore and I'm staying away from Alice." 

"I don't know what the deal is with Sonia, but Alice will get you. Sooner or later she will get you. Now, can I have Wednesday and Friday?" 

"All yours lover, at least for this week they are yours." 

+++++ 

Matty and I left the apartment at the same time, but she must have driven to work like a NASCAR driver at Daytona and she had already been at work jerking Betsy's chain by the time I got there. The first person I saw when I walked into the office was Betsy and when I said, "Good morning" all I got back was a scowl. I'm not at my best in the mornings so I answered the scowl with, "I guess that means that we are not on for tonight" and I walked on past her to my desk. 

It was just enough to send me to my desk wondering just how I managed to let my cock get me in so much trouble. Sonia wasn't talking to me and all I did was what she wanted - had flat out asked for in fact - and now Betsy was pissed at me because I cheated with someone else before I cheated with her. Matty was using me to get back at her husband and Mary had plans for me that she wouldn't talk about and over on the sidelines Alice was watching it all with a bemused smile. 

And that was just the women. On the men's side Josh was pissed at me because I'd scored with Mary after he'd told me she was a lesbian. John and Steve were pissed because they had been hitting on Sonia, Betsy and Matty for some time and getting nowhere while I was brand new and had the women chasing me. At my last job it had been husbands and boyfriends; at this job it was damned near everybody. 

By coffee break my attitude was "Fuck them all." I was so pissed at the whole bunch of them that at break time I went across the street to the little coffee shop instead of going to the break room. 

When I came back to the office I found Mary sitting at my desk waiting for me. "Just stopped by to check on your progress with our plan." 

"Depends on what you mean by progress." 

"Oh that sounds interesting." 

"I think that the plan, such as it was, is over and done with." 

"How so?" 

"Sonia is avoiding me and Betsy is pissed because I did Matty before I did her." 

"I forgot about that - the Matty/Betsy thing - it apparently goes back quite a ways. So what does it mean?" 

"I don't know and I don't have a clue. I'm not so sure that it isn't working out for the best since now I'm not under so much pressure to perform." 

"Good, that suits me." 

"It suits you? Does that come with an explanation?" 

"I told you that I wanted more of you. Now I don't have such a crowded schedule to work around. Since Betsy is out of the picture may I have tonight?" 

"I don't know. I haven't actually talked to Betsy yet today so I don't know for sure where we are." 

"Okay. So you'll let me know before we leave tonight?" 

"That I will." 

"How about the weekend? Can I have Saturday and Sunday?" 

"Sure, as long as you realize I'm going to use some of it to rest." 

Mary laughed and said, "We will just have to see about that." 

+++++ 

The rest of the morning went fast as I had a very full 'in basket' that had to be cleared. When lunchtime came I debated on going out for lunch, but then decided not to go to lunch at all. I was sitting at my desk going through some inventory sheets when Betsy came up to me. 

"Sorry about this morning, but I'd just heard Matty tell me in glowing terms about her evening with you. We have a history and the news ground on me and I'm afraid I wasn't in a very good mood when you saw me. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry and to check and see if tonight was still mine." 

"Of course it is. Only you can call it off." 

"Good. I'll be waiting in the parking lot and I'll follow you home." 

I picked up the phone and called Mary and told her that she couldn't have the evening and just as I was hanging up Sonia came up to me. "Got time to talk?" 

"I always have time for a beautiful woman." 

"Well, what it is is that I have come to apologize for how I've been acting these last couple of days. It wasn't anything that you did, it is just that I'm so embarrassed, just mortified, over what happened that I just haven't been able to face you. Believe me when I say that my being here apologizing is an act of supreme will on my part. I didn't think I could ever face you again after what I did." 

"It was a unique experience for me, but no harm done." 

"When can I see you again?" 

"Are you sure that you want to?" 

"Yes, I'm sure, but you need to understand that I may have to make several trips to the porcelain throne. I'm going to keep sucking your cock until I get it right. Plus, we never did get to anal and that was on the list. How about tonight?" 

"No, sorry, but I have something going every night for the rest of this week." 

Sonia gave me a thoughtful look and then said, "You sure that you aren't putting me off because of what I did? Is this your way of easing my guilt, but still staying away from me?" 

"How about we do this. Plan on having a long lunch with me tomorrow. We can hit a motel and I'll feed you tube steak for lunch." 

Sonia stuck out her hand and said, "Deal" and we shook on it." 

+++++ 

My next visitor was Matty. She came up to me and handed me one red rose and said, "Thank you for last night. I'm glad I let my sister talk me into getting even with my husband and I'm glad it was with you and I'm looking forward to tomorrow and Friday." 

"So am I, but did you have to rush and tell Betsy?" 

"Of course I did. I told you up front that I wanted to beat her and where would the fun be in that if I didn't let her know. Did she say something to you?" 

"She scowled at me all morning." 

"That's great. Thanks honey, you just made my day." 

Matty walked away smiling and as I watched her move toward her desk I thought, "Women! Would any man ever understand them?"  

===

Chapter 5: Betsy, part 1 

Betsy followed me home, but once inside my apartment she seemed a little hesitant. "Having second thoughts?" 

"No, I'm just not sure how I should proceed. I'm breaking new ground here and I don't know what to do." 

"Well, we didn't come here to play cards, checkers or chess. We both know why we are here and we both know the mechanics of that so I guess a reasonable place to start would be to take our clothes off." 

"What, no romance? No hugs or kisses, just get to it?" 

"Isn't that what you said you wanted? The way I remember it you said, "No emotional involvement, no romantic ties." 

"Still a girl likes a little of that stuff; to set the mood if nothing else." 

"You can get that stuff from your hubby. You need to look at it from my point of view. You are a married woman cheating on her husband. In other words, you are a slut. Not that there is anything wrong with being a slut, in fact I love having sluts around, but that is what I see when I have a married woman in my apartment. That is what I want to see. That's all you have to do Betsy, be a slut. Say slutty things, do slutty things. Be a lady, a loving wife, a devoted mother someplace else, but when you are here in my apartment be the biggest slut you can be." 

"What does a slut do?" 

"Whatever she wants Betsy, whatever she wants." 

She didn't say another word, just started undressing. 

+++++ 

I told her to be a slut and she was. Once she was naked she told me that she wanted me to tit fuck her and I did. She told me to fuck her cunt and I did. She told me to suck her pussy and I did and while I was doing it she turned on me and went sixty-nine. And the entire time she moaned and talked. 

"That's it, fuck your slut. Come on baby, make me your slut, stuff your cock into my slutty body. Cum in my slutty mouth baby, your slut wants your cum in her belly," and a lot more along those lines. 

The surprise came when she said, "I want you in my ass lover. Take my slutty ass. I've never had a cock there before so come on lover, take your sluts ass. Make me your ass slut baby; stuff your cock in my shit hole and make my ass yours." 

"You're kidding me. That sexy ass has never been tapped?" 

"I've never wanted it and I never intended to do it." 

"Why now?" 

"Because I'm your slut and sluts take it in the ass." 

Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth I opened the drawer of the bedside stand and got out the tube of KY Jelly. I got Betsy on her hands and knees and while I used the fingers of my left hand to work on her pussy I used my right to work on her ass. Using a liberal amount of KY I worked one and then two fingers into her ass. I worked them for a couple of minutes and then I added a third. Betsy was moaning as both hands worked on her and when I felt that she was as ready as I could get her I moved up behind her and told her to bite down on the pillow. 

"It will hurt at first, but after a while the hurt goes away." 

I lubed my cock up real good with the KY and then I slowly worked my cock in Betsy's butt hole and I felt her body stiffen as she moaned into the pillow. 

"You okay? You want me to stop?" 

She lifted her head from the pillow and moaned, "It hurts, but don't stop. We've gone this far, so just do it," and she buried her head back in the pillow. I worked my cock real slow for the next couple of minutes and Betsy's moans began to change tone. She lifted her head from the pillow and said, "Just a little faster; it is starting to feel good." 

Two minutes later she was pushing her ass back at me as she moaned, "Yes, yes, yes, yes." I grabbed her hips and started to drive my cock up her dirt road and she started shaking and screamed out, "Oh fuck, oh God, oh shit, oh yesssssss" as she had an orgasm. It was another minute of hard pounding before I had my climax and then I just knelt there and held her hips as my cock shriveled up inside her hot tunnel. 

I pulled out and fell back on the bed and tried to catch my breath. Betsy was still on her knees next to me, head still on the pillow and she said, "Sweet fucking Jesus, I never would have believed how good that taking it in the butt could be. And then she surprised -no, shocked would be a better term - the hell out of me. She spun around, took my slime-covered cock in her mouth and began giving me a blow job. I took a quick glance at the clock and saw that we didn't have time for any more playing if she was going to beat her husband home and I tried to push her away. She resisted and so I told her to look at the clock and she did and then she went right back to sucking my cock until it was hard again. She took her mouth off me and looked down at me. 

"Was that slutty enough for you?" 

"It's a start, but have you noticed the time? Don't you have to beat your hubby home?" 

"What, and waste a perfectly good hard cock? It's a given that I'm going to be lying to him from now on so tonight is as good a time as any to start." 

She got back on her knees with her head down on the pillow and said, "Do your ass slut again lover, fuck my shit hole." 

Just before Betsy left she said, "I think I'm going to like being your slut. You need to think of some slutty things I can do the next time we get together. Tuesdays and Thursdays, right?" 

"Right sweetie, Tuesdays and Thursdays." 

As I watched her walk to her car I pondered her last words, to think about some slutty things to do next time, and wondered what I had managed to get myself into. For slutty, how was I going to top her first time out of the box - sucking my cock when it was straight out of her virgin ass? For all of my talk about wanting my women to be sluts in my apartment I was still a pretty white bread kind of guy. To me, just being a married woman fucking around on her husband qualified Betsy as being a slut. What the hell did I know about slutty things? I was just a guy who liked to have sex with married women. The kinkiest I ever got was eating a married woman's pussy just after she'd fucked her husband and Betsy was going to be back in two days expecting something slutty. I didn't have a clue as to what to do. 

+++++ 

The next day at work things were considerably warmer, at least as far as the women were concerned. Sonia was walking in from the parking lot at the same time I was and just before we entered the front door she said, "Don't forget our lunch date." I smiled and nodded and then we were inside and the first person I saw was Betsy. She gave me a dazzling smile, which told me that she had either beaten her husband home or had managed to satisfy him with whatever lie she told. 

I was sitting at my desk when Matty came in, sat down at her desk and looked over at me. She smiled, but I could see the gears turning as she wondered about how my night with Betsy had gone and how it might have compared to the evening she had spent with me. I knew that when I saw her after work I would be interrogated and I wondered just what I could say that wouldn't cause problems. About an hour after start time Mary came in and sat down on the edge of my desk. 

"I won't ask you how last went. I just saw Betsy and she is positively glowing. I'm looking at your schedule for the rest of this week and I'm beginning to wonder if you will have any steam left for me when I get you this weekend." 

"I wonder if I have any left for tonight." 

"Poor baby. Getting too much are we?" 

I smiled at her and nodded a 'no' but as she walked away I had to wonder if maybe she might be right. Maybe I was getting too much. Never before had I gotten so much so fast. Before I would have an affair that would last a while and then I would move on to the next one, but here circumstances had put them all into a compacted time frame and I'd had more sex in the last two weeks than I'd had in the previous six months. Was there such a thing as too much pussy? God I hoped not. 

+++++ 

Just before leaving for lunch with Sonia Matty came up to me, "I have to cancel on tonight. I forgot that my daughter has a school play and I have to go. I still have Friday, don't I?" 

"I'll look forward to it." 

Deep down it was good news; I needed a day of rest. 

Lunch hour with Sonia was both good and bad. We hit a motel room and when we got inside I went to help her take her clothes off, but she said no. 

"All that's going to happen this time is I'm going to work on giving you a blow job and this time I'll try not to mess it up." 

Not being an idiot and remembering what had happened the last time Sonia had given me head I stripped to the waist and then sat down on the edge of the bed. Sonia went to her knees in front of me, looked up at me, smiled and said, "I'll get better at this, I promise." 

She gave me an excellent blow job. She took her time and let me build up to my climax slowly. As much as I love a woman who swallows I still remembered the last time so I told Sonia when I was ready to let loose so she could finish me off by hand. She took her mouth off me and said, "I don't care lover, do it. I'm going to do this right" and she went back to blowing me. I erupted and she swallowed it all and when I was limp she let my dick fall from her mouth. She looked up at me and was getting ready to say something when suddenly she got to her feet and rushed to the bathroom. I heard the sounds that told me what was happening and when she hadn't come out after five minutes I got up and went in to check on her. She was sitting on the toilet wiping tears off her cheeks with a towel and when I came in she looked up at me, "I'm sorry. This is just so embarrassing." 

"No need to be sorry. It was a very good blow job and not every woman swallows cum. A lot of them don't like it. They give a man good head and when the man is ready they finish it by hand." 

"But that isn't what I want. I want to experience the whole thing, not just part of it." 

"Well then, we will just have to see to it that you get plenty more opportunities to practice so that you can get it right." 

"You don't care that I ruin the moment by rushing to the bathroom?" 

"From a purely selfish point of view, no. You got me off and that is what I was looking for. I'm sorry though that the enjoyment wasn't there for you. Come on sweetie, touch up your makeup and let's get back to work. We can try again next week." 

Sonia was quiet on the way back to work and spent most of her time looking out the passenger side window. When we pulled into the parking lot at work I started to get out of the car, but Sonia put out a hand to stop me. 

"Can we talk for a minute?" 

"Sure." 

"Don't take this wrong, but I don't think I want to see you next week." 

"Oh? Did I suddenly develop a bad case of body odor or bad breath?" 

"No sweetie, it isn't you, it's me. I have a fantastic sex life with my hubby. True, he won't do oral or anal, but as far as regular sex goes he is the Energizer Bunny. He would go 24/7 if we both didn't have to work. I've decided that what happened the two times we were together is a sign telling me to be happy with what I have. In short sweetie, I'm being told to stop cheating on the guy I love and who loves me. As far as anal and oral are concerned I'm just going to have to find a way to get hubby to do it. If I can't, I guess that I'll just have to do without. Don't be mad at me okay?" 

"I won't be mad if you promise to do something for me." 

"What?" 

"You still have to dance with me when we stop for drinks and you have to promise not to slap me if I cop a feel every now and again." 

"You got it sweetie, but if you can cop feels off me you can't get pissed when I cop one off you." 

"Deal."

Chapter 6: Betsy, part 2 

I had mixed thoughts as I sat at my desk and watched Sonia move around the office. On the one hand she was the one woman in the office that I had really wanted. If I had been given a choice in the beginning - you can have one and only one - I would have gone for Sonia. On the other hand I currently had more pussy than I ever expected to have and the loss of Sonia did take some of the pressure off of me. Now I only had three women to try and satisfy instead of four. I was looking at Sonia's tight, well shaped ass as she stood at the copier making copies when a voice from behind me said, "Well lover, have you come up with something that your slut can do tonight?" I turned and found Betsy standing behind me. 

"I'm thinking on it. I just can't make up my mind whether to ease you into it or just have you jump right in with both feet." 

"Best you just push me into the deep end of the pool lover. If you let me wade around in the shallow end first I may chicken out." 

"We can talk about it tonight at the bar when we stop with the others for a drink after work." 

"Do we have to waste time going there? I'd rather get right to it." 

"Yes we do have to stop there. I just decided what slutty thing we are going to do tonight and part of it is going to the bar." 

"Give me a hint." 

"Oh no. That might give you time to think it over and you might just decide to run home and hide under the bed." 

"That bad?" 

"Not for me." 

She gave me a contemplative look and then said, "Okay, see you there." 

+++++ 

I got to the bar first and was sitting at a table with Josh when Betsy came in. The three of us sat there making small talk while the rest of the gang filtered in. After a couple of drinks Betsy and I got up to dance. As soon as we were on the floor Betsy said, "We are wasting precious time lover." 

"No we aren't. When we go back to the table you will ask Mary or one of the other girls to watch your purse and then you and I will go out to the parking lot." 

"I can't do that! My god, what will the others think?" 

"You already know what they will think." 

"I do?" 

"Sure you do. What do you think when you see Alice heading for the parking lot with one of the guys?" 

"I think that she is just such a sl....oh my." 

"That's right babe, you want to be a slut so let's get to it." 

"But..." 

"No buts babe. A slut doesn't care about what other people think. Do you see Alice giving a shit about what the rest of you are thinking? You want to be a slut so let's go do it." 

"But I can't, I just can't. These are the people that I work with." 

"Okay, it is your choice, you want to be a slut, you don't want to be a slut, it is all up to you." 

We finished the dance and went back to the table. I was sipping my beer when Matty came up to me and said, "Come on honey, let's dance." 

As soon as we hit the floor she said, "Any chance of my getting tonight as well as tomorrow?" 

"I don't know. My plans are in flux right now. I do have something going, but it might fall through. I'll just have to wait and see." 

"Anything I can do to help things fall through?" 

"Whoa sweetie, I haven't said that I want things to fall through. In fact, I'm really hoping that they don't." 

"Well if they don't work I'll be standing by." 

On the way back to the table I saw Betsy watching Matty and me and I wondered what she was thinking. It didn't take me long to find out. I'd no sooner sat down than Betsy said, "Sonia, would you please watch my purse?" and then she stood up and waited to see what I would do - as if there were any doubt. I got up and we headed for the door that led to the parking lot. Just before going out the door I looked back at the table and saw Matty looking at us with a pissed off expression, Alice and Sonia looking at each other with 'shocked' looks on their faces and Mary looking at the two of them with a grin on her face. I won't even try to cover the range of expressions on the men. 

+++++ 

When we reached my car Betsy said, "Okay, what do we do now?" 

"You get in the back seat and start behaving like a slut." 

"Don't I have a choice?" 

"You made it when you asked Sonia to watch your purse and then got up and walked out here with me." 

I opened the car door and we climbed in the back and Betsy said, "What now?" 

"Normally we would do some hot and heavy necking that would lead to a blow job, some finger fucking and then we would fuck, but tonight I want to go straight to the fucking part." 

"Why?" 

"Because I'm betting that Alice is sitting in there not believing that you are out here fucking. She's thinking, "No, not Betsy, they are probably just sitting there talking." She's going to convince herself that she needs to verify that. She will grab one of the guys that she usually comes out here with and she will come out here to see what we are doing. When she does I want her to see your legs kicking in the air as I pound your slutty, unfaithful pussy with my cock." 

"Must you talk like that?" 

"Like what?" 

"Saying things like, "Your slutty, unfaithful pussy." 

"Of course I don't have to talk that way. I'm just playing the game that you indicated you wanted to play. When you left me Tuesday you asked me to think of slutty things that you could do the next time. This afternoon you asked me if I had come up anything slutty for you to do tonight so here we are and I'm trying to give you slutty. If you have changed your mind just go inside and get your purse and we will go on over to my place." 

Betsy had been sitting looking toward the building and suddenly she said, "Oh shit!" and unbuttoned her blouse. She quickly unsnapped her bra and then said, "Hurry, suck my tits." 

I was caught a little unprepared for her sudden change in attitude and I just sat there looking at her. She reached out and grabbed me and pulled me toward her. "Hurry damn it, here comes Alice." 

I leaned forward and started licking Betsy's left nipple and moved my hand to start rolling the right one between the thumb and forefinger. She leaned back and her hands moved to my head and held me to her. A minute or two went by and then Betsy pushed me away. 

"I guess I just made my choice. Get your cock out honey; it's time to fuck me like the slut that I guess I'm going to be." 

+++++ 

Alice must not have been believed when she went back inside to tell everyone what she had seen. While Betsy was busy being fucked and sucking my cock between bouts several people came out of the bar and 'just happened' to walk by my car. I was fucking Betsy for the fourth time when she said, "God I fell like such a slut lying here while you fuck me and they watch." 

I looked up and saw Josh and Steve standing outside the car looking inside at what we were doing. 

"Maybe I should do them too. Would that be slutty enough for you?" 

"You fucking whorish slut you. God, but that would be so hot. I can see it now, Betsy the Gangbang Queen." 

I pulled out of her and quickly got out of the car leaving Betsy looking up at me with confusion on her face. Josh was pretty quick on the uptake and he was in the car and in Betsy before she had a chance to fully realize what was happening. A dozen strokes later and she was clawing at Josh and asking him to go harder and faster. Steve moved around to the other side of the car and I watched him climb in and push his cock into Betsy's mouth and then Josh and Steve double-teamed her. I watched until Josh was done and he and Steve had swapped places and then I went back into the bar. As I sat down at the table Sonia asked, "Where's Betsy?" 

I nodded toward the parking lot and said, "She's busy right now." 

I saw John and Harry exchange a glance and then get up and hurry out to the parking lot. A couple of minutes later Matty got up and went outside and then three or four minutes later she came back in and sat down and looked over at me. She looked like she wanted to say something, but then she turned her head and looked away.' 

When Josh and Steve came in I grabbed Betsy's purse and went back out to my car. Harry was zipping himself up while standing there and watching John bang into Betsy. He looked at me, "I never would have believed it if I hadn't seen it and taken part. I hope that this is just the first night of many." 

He headed back for the bar and left me to watch John's hairy ass rise and fall as he pushed his cock into a moaning Betsy. 

Betsy's eyes met mine and she cried, "Oh god Johnny, fuck me, fuck me hard, fuck me like the whore I am. Make me cum baby, make me cum." 

"Here it comes you hot slut you." 

"Oh yes, oh yes, fill me, fill me baby, push deep and fill me." 

John finally finished and as he backed out he said, "You have no idea of how long I have wanted to do that." 

I moved in to pick up where he left off and my cock had just pushed into Betsy's hot, wet swamp when she hit me upside my head as hard as she could. It was so hard that I saw stars and heard bells ring and then she did it a second time and I became aware that she was screaming at me. 

"You bastard! You mother fucking son of a bitch! You miserable piece of shit! Get off me!" And she hit me again. I scrambled out of the car and she came out after me. She swung at my head with her purse, but I ducked it and backed away from her as she tried to kick me in the nuts and then she turned and ran sobbing into the bar. I followed along behind her and got there just in time to see Matty put her arms around Betsy and then lead her into the ladies room. 

+++++ 

Everything changed after that night. I went overnight from more pussy than one man could handle to none. It started when Matty came back from taking Betsy to the bathroom. She sat down across from me at the table and said, "You are an asshole and I can't for the life of me think what was going on in my mind that made me have anything to do with you." 

"What? 

"What you did to Betsy. How could you have done that? 

"She wanted to..." 

"Bullshit! She trusted you to play but keep things reasonable. What you let happen to her was damned near criminal. Do me a favor and never talk to me again." 

She got up; moved to another seat and I finished my beer and went on home. 

The next day the only woman in the office who would even look my way was Alice. Mary came to me about an hour after I got to work and said, "Forget about the weekend. I don't think I like you anymore" and she walked away. By the end of the day the chilly atmosphere had gotten to me and just before quitting time I walked over to Betsy's desk. She looked up at me with a "Fuck off asshole" expression on her face and I stared right back at her. 

"I'm not going to apologize for anything. You were the one who wanted to play at being a slut and all I did was go along. You should have made damned sure that your idea of a slut and my idea of a slut were compatible before you started playing the game. Remember your "Push me off in the deep end" comment? I didn't make you be a slut, you chose that on your own so don't be pissed at me for your bad choices." 

I turned and went to the time clock, punched out and went home. 

+++++ 

I spent the weekend wondering if I should go in on Monday and give notice. It would be hard working there with everyone pissed off at me and I had almost convinced myself to do it, but Sunday night sitting in my kitchen at the table and composing my letter of resignation I suddenly stopped and said, "Fuck this shit!" and threw my pen down. Why should I let those ass wipes drive me away? All I did was what they wanted and now all of a sudden they don't want it and it is all my fault? Not fucking hardly! Okay, I probably should have spent a little more time playing the slut game with Betsy to make sure that it was what she really wanted before pushing her off the dock to sink or swim. It was an error in judgement, but it was based on what she indicated she wanted. When she was waffling on what she should do I told her to forget the slut stuff, go get her purse and then we would go to my place, but she was the one who made the decision to go forward with the idea of being a slut. She was the one who grabbed me and told me to suck her tits when she saw Alice coming and she was the one who brought up fucking the other guys. No by God, if they were going to be uncomfortable having me around, tough shit! 

+++++ 

For the next two weeks I kept pretty much to myself and ignored the women in the office. The men were friendly enough (and well they should be since I gave them Betsy) but I even stayed away from them for the most part. I didn't use the lunchroom for breaks or lunch and instead I went across the street to the little caf‚. A couple of times I saw Betsy get up from her desk and head toward mine and as soon as I was sure that it was my desk she was headed for I got up and went to the men's room. 

One day, near the end of my self-imposed exile I came back from lunch and found Alice sitting at my desk. She looked up at me and before I could say anything she asked, "Are you over your pout yet?" 

"What is that supposed to mean?" 

"You are obviously avoiding all of us; you haven't stopped for drinks in almost weeks and you don't even use the break room any more." 

"Yeah, well it seems that the ladies have decided that I am a pariah and they pretty much all told me to fuck off and die so I just decided to stay away from wherever they tend to be." 

"I'm one of the ladies and I haven't said that to you. Anyway, what I'm sitting here for is to invite you to stop with us tonight." 

"Why?" 

"Because sugar, I haven't sampled your wares yet." 

I started to say something and she cut me off before I could get a word out, "And don't give me any of that 'married only' shit. Mary isn't married and you rattled the bedsprings with her. Besides, "gossip central" told me why you avoided me and I want to set your mind at rest. I'm a blond sugar, but I'm not a dumb blond. I never climb into a back seat without a condom handy." 

"Why? Why do you do it? You are engaged to be married so why are screwing everything in pants?" 

"I'm engaged sugar, but not to be married." She waggled her huge diamond ring under my nose and said, "This ten carat diamond is part of a bribe. Greg gave me the ring, my car and he pays for my apartment in exchange for me being 'arm candy' every time he has to attend a family function or have dinner with his folks. He is as queer as a three-dollar bill, but if he wants to stay in daddy's will he can't let anyone know. Daddy is worth millions and Greg is an only child. He can't bear the thought of all that money going to charities, which is what would happen if daddy found out the Greg's true love is a bodybuilder named Bruce. So come on sugar. I know we will be good together." 

"No Alice, I don't think so. I'll just make everyone nervous." 

"No you won't sugar, everyone wants you back." 

"That isn't evident from what I see around here every day." 

"That's because they have all been warned off." 

"What?" 

"Yep. Betsy told every one that you belong to her and that they should stay away." 

"Bullshit. After that night in the parking lot I have been persona non grata around here." 

"That night maybe and possibly the next day, but then Betsy told every that she put you up to it. Then everyone was too embarrassed by the way they had behaved and they couldn't face you. About the time Mary decided to bite the bullet and crawl back to you is when Betsy warned everyone off." 

"Everyone but you?" 

"I'm my own woman sugar and I rarely do what anyone else tells me to do. Besides, I'm curious about what makes you so special that Betsy has put out a 'hands off' on you." 

"There isn't anything special about me; I'm just a normal guy who prefers to get his sex from somebody else's woman." 

"Well I guess in a way I am Greg's woman so how about it. If for no other reason stop for a drink so I can show Betsy what I think about her 'hands odd' directive. What about you? You like knowing that some woman has warned other women to stay away from you?" 

"You do know how to push buttons, don't you." 

"I just know you sugar. We are more alike than I care to think about right now. You going to be there?" 

"Yeah. I think I will stop by." 

+++++ 

I only had Alice's version of how things stood so to ease the awkwardness of joining a table where I might not be wanted I decided to get there first and then see how the others chose to sit down when they got there. Mary was the first to arrive to arrive and I saw here see me and then hesitate a fraction before coming over and sitting at the table with me. She gave me a weak, "Hi, welcome back." I said nothing, just lifted my glass in sort of a salute and nodded. Josh and John showed up next and minutes later Sonia, Matty and Steve arrived and they all came straight to the table with no hesitation. Then Alice came in, grabbed a chair and more or less forced Steve to move over so she could sit next to me. 

"Anybody say mean things to you or throw anything at you yet?" she whispered in my ear. 

"Not yet, but the evening is still young." 

"Buy me a drink and then I want you to dance with me." 

"You trying to stake a claim before anyone else can?" 

"You bet sugar, I hate being the only one here not to have spent some time with you." 

Alice and I were on the dance floor when Betsy arrived. She sat down at the table and the look she threw our way was not a warm one. Alice and I stayed out on the floor for three numbers and I saw Betsy getting more and more agitated. Finally I told Alice we needed to get back to the table before we gave Betsy apoplexy. 

"You going to let her get to you or is tonight my night?" 

"I don't know. I'm not much of a back seat boy; how does Greg feel about sleep overs?" 

"He is a very understanding guy." 

"We'll see then. Like I told you when you got here, the night is still young.' 

+++++ 

I wasn't really sure why I had stopped at the bar that night. I suppose part of it was the curiosity that Alice had planted in my head when she told me about Betsy's 'hands off' edict. Part of it was because I hadn't been laid in three weeks and Alice was offering herself up on a platter. The one thing I hadn't come to do was pick up where I'd left off with Betsy, Matty and Mary. 

The first one to make a move was Sonia. She got up from her chair and came over to me. "Come on sweetie, dance with me." 

As soon as she had me on the floor she said, "I wondered if I'd ever see you here again." 

"Why would anyone who was being treated like a leper want to stop, and what about Betsy's hands off policy?" 

"You know better than that sweetie. We already have a deal, remember? Dancing and some touchy-feely? Besides, if we didn't already have our deal do you seriously think I would give a rats ass what Betsy says?" 

"So why haven't you stopped by and said hi?" 

"You may not be aware of it sweetie, but the way you have been sitting behind your desk and scowling at everybody has tended to make you just a little bit unapproachable. But be that as it may, what about now?" 

"What about now?" 

"Yes dummy, what about now. You haven't poked your cock into me once or squeezed one of my tits. Have I lost my appeal?" 

I pulled her close so she could feel my erection. "Better?" 

"Much sweetie. I want to suck it and I want to feel it sliding into my ass, but I can't. You do know that I want to, don't you?" 

"Yes baby, I do." 

The song ended and we went back to the table. 

+++++ 

For the next half-hour I sipped my beer and watched as Josh, Steve, John and Harry took turns dancing with all of the girls, but I didn't bother asking any of them to dance with me. Finally Betsy came over and sat down next to me. 

"I suppose you've heard?" 

"Heard what?" 

"That I've become the slut you wanted. Every time I come in here now I end up out in the parking lot. I'm making more trips than Alice ever did."  

===

"Well good for you Betsy." 

"That's it? Good for you Betsy?" 

"What did you expect?" 

"I expected you to say "Come on Betsy, show me," and then I expected you to take me to your place and fuck my brains out." 

"Sorry Betsy, not interested." 

"Not interested? Why? I did it for you. I turned myself into the slut you wanted." 

"I never said I wanted a slut Betsy. What I said was you could be a loving wife and mother someplace else, but in my apartment I wanted you to be a slut. I never said one word about you going out and becoming one. You're the one that took that idea and ran with it." 

"Oh, so now that I'm a slut you don't want anything to do with me is that it?" 

"No, not at all. I like sluts. Life is so much simpler when you are dealing with sluts." 

"Then what is it? Why aren't you interested anymore?" 

"The hits Betsy. The swinging purse, the names you called me, the kick you took at my balls and the way you turned everyone else there against me are what ended it Betsy." 

She started at me for several very long moments and then she snarled, "You bastard, you fucking bastard." 

"Nice talking to you too Betsy" and I got up and headed for the men's bathroom. When I came back Betsy was on her way out to the parking lot with Steve and Harry and Harry gave me a thumbs up and I smiled at him. I hadn't quite made it back to the table when Matty grabbed my arm and tried to lead me out on to the dance floor. I pulled away from her and made my way back to the table. Matty followed me. 

"What the hell is wrong with you?" 

"Just honoring your request." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Your exact words were, "Do me a favor and never talk to me again." So, you got it, now go away and leave me alone." 

"Oh come on lover, that was heat of the moment. We all thought that you had fucked over Betsy and we didn't think it was right, but she told us that it wasn't your fault." 

"So where have you been these last two weeks Matty? I don't remember you coming up to me and saying that you were sorry and that you hoped that I would understand why you said it. And don't give me any of that Betsy said hands off shit. You two have been at war since you were teenagers and there isn't any way that you were going to do anything she said if you didn't want to. Go away Matty, we don't have anything to say to each other any more." 

She opened her mouth to say something, but I suddenly realized that it had been a mistake for me to have stopped and I got up and walked away from her. I walked over to where Alice was talking with Mary and said, "Are we on?" 

"You bet sugar." 

"Grab your purse then and let's go." 

"Let me make a quick trip to the ladies sugar and then I'm all yours." 

Alice headed for the bathroom and left me standing there with Mary looking up at me. 

"Alice going to have most of your time occupied or will you have some to spare." 

"None to spare for you. You don't like me anymore, remember?" 

I walked over to the bathrooms and waited for Alice. 

+++++ 

I would have never believed it, but Alice and I clicked and after a couple of months of trying to fuck each other to death Alice semi moved in with me. I say semi because she kept the apartment that Greg is paying for. She is still his Arm Candy for family events and she and Greg do occasionally have his parents over for dinner. 

"He's been good to me sugar and I feel that I owe him a lot. Besides, it might make your juices flow a little hotter thinking of me being with him. I'm just such a slut that I might be working on him to convince him that he should turn to straight sex. You'll just have to fuck me as soon as I get home from a date with him to see if I was successful and am giving you sloppy seconds." 

I'm no longer with the company, but it wasn't my relationship with the women that made me leave. My father passed away and left his business, among other things, to my sister, two brothers and me. My siblings were not interested in the business and wanted to sell it so I scraped up the money and bought them out. 

Alice still works at the old company and has kept me up to date on the others. Josh finally got Mary to go out with him and he promptly got her pregnant. They got married, have a little girl and according to Alice they are very happy together. 

Matty took up with one of the bartenders for a while and then one day she quit her job and no one has seen or heard from her since. 

Betsy kept playing at being a slut and she must have done something to make her husband suspicious because one night he showed up at the bar just in time to see Betsy climbing into a back seat with two guys. He went after them and they beat the shit out of him. Betsy still works there, but she doesn't stop at the bar any more and she hasn't said a word to anyone about the outcome of that night. 

The biggest surprise was that Sonia left her husband. She asked Alice for my address and phone number, Alice gave them to her and Sonia called and asked me to have lunch with her. 

"We both know what she wants sugar so here is a little something for you to consider before you talk with her. You know me well enough by now to know my sexual appetites. Sooner or later I'm going to try a taste of someone else. I'll come home to you and fuck your brains out after and I won't lie to you or try to hide things. We are a matched set sugar, we belong together for the long run and you know it. What I'm trying to say sugar is you can go for it and it won't keep me from being here waiting for you when you come home. Or for that matter, you let me know when you are bringing her home and I stay at my apartment that night." 

"Oh I don't know about that. One of my fantasies has been to have two sexy lady's to play with at the same time." 

"Oooh, wouldn't that be kinky." 

"Yes, it would." 

"Well sugar, if you like kinky maybe I should bring Greg home with me some night and see where that goes." 

Before I could say anything she burst out laughing. "Oh sugar, you should see the expression on your face. Come on sugar, take me to bed and let's talk some more about your fantasies." Report_Story
