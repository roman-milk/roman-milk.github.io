 ****** Tricia's Dirty Hole ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© Trisha and I had been together for almost twenty years - sixteen of them married. At thirty-eight she had put on an extra pound or two, but then three kids can do that to you. Those extra pounds didn't matter to me because as far as I was concerned those pounds were in all the right places and Trish was still the sexiest woman I'd ever seen. Besides, who was I to say anything about extra weight? I was fifteen pounds heavier than I was on the day we were married. I blame most of it Trish being a great cook. And I did fight it. I worked out at the gym three days a week and I ran four miles a day on the days I didn't go to the gym. Even if I have to say so myself I wasn't in bad shape for a forty year old who spent his days sitting at a desk. 

 Trisha and I had a good marriage and enjoyed a comfortable life style. My job paid enough that we were able to own a decent house, have two cars and save enough for the three weeks of vacation that I received every year. 

 Trisha Marie Thomas and I met in high school. I was a senior and she was a sophomore. I was the photographer for the school newspaper and I was in the office the day Trisha came in to apply for one of the reporter vacancies. Each class had a representative who reported on class activities and the sophomore class rep had moved out of state. 

 I do have to say that I was smitten as soon as Trish walked into the student newspaper office. I was never one for being reticent so I started talking to her and before she left the office I had a date with her for the next night. Our first date was an evening of roller skating at Skate City and we had a good time. I asked her out again, she said yes, and our second date was burgers and a movie. We seemed to click and we started keeping steady company. 

 I'd been going with Trish for about three months before I found out she had a wild side. There was a party that she wanted to go to and she asked me to take her. I said okay before I found out that it was at a frat house at the local college. I felt a tad out of place since I was almost two years younger than any of the other guys there, but Trish wasn't bothered by the age difference. In fact, before the evening was over I found out that it wasn't the first party that she had attended at that house. 

 Both of my parents were alcoholics and with them as examples I swore that I would never drink so I spent the evening sipping Coke and trying to keep up with Trish. She loved to dance and pretty much stayed out on the improvised dance floor. I guess I managed to get maybe one dance with her out of every five. I noticed that she took a lot of 'potty breaks' which I thought odd since she wasn't drinking all that much. It was about three hours into the party that I found out about those 'potty' breaks. 

 Trish left the dance floor and headed for the bathroom and I had to go too so I was right behind her. She walked right by the bathroom and went to a door just the other side of it, opened the door and went in. I hit the bathroom, took my whiz, and when I came out I went to the door she had gone to and opened it. The smell that hit you when you opened the door told you everything you needed to know even before you saw anything. Trish was sitting on the arm of a couch sucking on a fat reefer. She took a hit and passed it to the guy sitting next to her. Somebody said: 

 "Hey man, be cool. Close the fucking door." 

 Trish looked my way, giggled and said, "It's only my boyfriend. Come on Rob; suck some smoke with us." 

 "No thanks" I said and I turned and left the room. I wasn't a "goody goody two shoes" by any means. I'd tried pot and I hadn't liked it. To me it tasted like shit and it gave me a headache. I was told I must have gotten some bad shit and a guy gave me some stuff that he said was "primo" and I tried it again. It still tasted like shit and it still gave me a headache so that was the end of pot smoking for me. 

 As I walked away from that room I realized that I was between a rock and a hard place. If I went into that room and pulled Trish out of it it could be the end of our relationship, but if I left her in there she would be stoned out of her gourd when I took her home and her parents would kill me. I'd just made up my mind to go back in and get her when she came out of the room, grabbed my arm and said: 

 "Come on Robbie. Dance with me." 

 As we danced she asked me why I hadn't come in and taken part and I told her. Then I asked her why she did dope and she said: 

 "Because I like the way it makes me feel." 

 There wasn't anything that I could say to that so I just danced. One of the frat boys cut in so I moved off to the side and just watched. I had my back to three guys and I overheard them talking. 

 "Looks like we won't get a chance at her tonight. Her boyfriend is staying too close." 

 "Shame. We almost had her last time. Half an hour more and one more joint and we could have nailed her. Could have had her pulling a train." 

 "Well there is always the next time." 

 Either they didn't recognize my back or it wasn't Trish that they were talking about, but I had a bad feeling about that frat house. I went back out on the floor and cut in on Trish and the guy she was dancing with and told her that it was time to go. 

 "Let me make one more trip back to the room and then we can leave." 

 "No more trips to the room Trish. It is time to go." 

 "You think that just because you're my date that you own me? I'm going back to the room one more time." 

 "Okay Trish; have it your way. I guess someone will see to it that you get home. Goodnight." 

 I walked away from her and headed for the front door. I was almost to my car when Trish came running up behind me. She fell into step beside me and gasped out: 

 "You were going to leave me there? You were just going to walk away and leave me there?" 

 "I wasn't going to stand there and argue with you and I wasn't going to physically drag you out. You basically said, "Screw you; I'm going back to the room and smoke some dope" so I left. 

 We got into the car and as we pulled away from the curb Trish said, "Did you even think about what I would have had to tell my parents when some other guy brought me home?" 

 "No I didn't. I was too busy thinking about what they would say and do to me when I brought you home stoned." 

 "I don't ever get that bad." 

 "You sure looked like you were working on it to me." 

 When I got her home I walked her to her door and then turned to leave. 

 "Don't I even get a kiss?" 

 "I'm not in the mood Trish." 

 "Oh come on Robbie; don't be that way. Don't be mad at me because I like to have a little fun and I like to feel good." 

 "Oh yeah? Well let me tell you something about going to that frat house to have fun and feel good." 

 I told her about the conversation that I'd overheard and I lied to her and said that they had mentioned her by name. 

 "If I hadn't of been there or if I'd paid a little less attention your trip to that room would have ended up with you on your back on a mattress pulling a train. Think about how much fun that would have been. Good night Trisha." 

 I left her standing there on the porch, got in my car and drove home. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 The next day was Saturday and I called Trish about noon and her mother told me: 

 "Sorry Robbie, but Trisha says she doesn't want to talk to you." 

 I tried again on Sunday and got the same answer. In my mind I had done nothing wrong so I just shrugged and got on with my life. I graduated two weeks later and took a job working on my uncle's farm for the summer and in the fall I started college. The college was local and I was living at home. 

 One Saturday morning I was in my room working on a paper I had to turn in when my mother called up to me. 

 "Robert? There is someone here to see you." 

 I went downstairs and found Trish waiting in the living room. 

 "Hi Robbie." 

 "Hello Trisha." 

 "How have you been?" 

 "Fine." 

 "I wondered. I haven't heard from you." 

 "That's not true Trisha. You heard from me; you just wouldn't take the calls. 

 "I'm sorry Robbie. I was being a bitch because I was upset with the way you dropped me off on our last date. I had the bright idea that I wouldn't talk to you for a couple of days to show you how pissed I was, but then you never called again. I came looking for you but your mother told me that you were gone for the summer." 

 "So what do you want Trisha?" 

 "I'm here; doesn't that tell you?" 

 "Tell me what?" 

 "You are my boyfriend Robbie; I miss you." 

 Bottom line was that Trish and I ended up a couple again and we stayed a couple most of the time. We did argue and break up a few times, usually over her use of pot. Trish did like to party, especially with friends who liked to smoke dope as much as she did. I really think that some of those break ups were deliberately instigated by her to free her up to go to some party or other where she could do what she liked to do without my disapproving stare always being on her. 

 Then all of a sudden Trish stopped doing dope. She never did tell me why, but about a year later I found out from her best friend. It happened during one of our break ups. Trish and Maggie had gone to a keg party at a frat house - the very same frat house were Trish and I had our first blow up - and Trish started smoking as soon as she got there. About three hours after they got there Maggie had gone looking for Trish and had found her in a room with three guys. They had her on her back on a couch with her skirt up around her waist and one of the guys was pulling her panties down. Maggie started yelling and screaming and the guys took off. Trish was lying there and giggling. She was totally out of it. She was so stoned that she had no clue as to what was about to happen. It was a wake up call for Trish and to the best of my knowledge she never smoked pot again over the next sixteen years. 

 But we managed to hang in there and two weeks after I got my degree in Business Management we were married. I took a job with the XYZ Corporation and two years later I was transferred to another state. Fourteen years and three promotions later I was transferred back to our home town. We had been back three weeks when Maggie threw us a "Welcome Home" party. We made arrangements to have the kids spend the night with Trisha's parents and after dropping them off we headed for the party. 

 The party was being held at The Saddleback Inn and there were at least fifty people there that we had known before we moved away. Trish was wearing her LBD (little black dress) and high heels and did she ever look hot. I do have to admit to a feeling of pride when I walked into the Saddleback with her on my arm. 

 The live band was playing music of the late Sixties and early Seventies and Trish was in a dancing mood and ready to party. We hadn't been there half an hour and Trish had already finished off two glasses of white wine and Maggie had gotten her to do three shots of Jose Cuervo complete with the bite of lemon and the licking of salt from the hand. I was of course nursing my Coca-Cola. I danced the first four dances with Trish and then got involved with socializing and catching up on all that had happened while we were gone. 

 Trish started dancing with any guy who would ask her and she pretty much stayed out on the dance floor. I noticed that she danced with a guy named Tim more than anyone else. I didn't think too much of it figuring that it was because he asked her to dance more than anyone else did and as long as he kept her out there she wouldn't be trying to drag me onto the floor. 

 I don't know how long we had been there before Trish came up to me and whispered in my ear: 

 "Tim says he has some killer weed baby. I know I stopped all those years ago, but I want to get high tonight. Can I baby? Can I got outside and smoke some?" 

 What harm would it do I thought. She had been so good for so long and I was there to keep an eye on her so I told her to go for it. It was maybe a half hour later when she came up to me and I could smell her from ten feet away. She reeked of pot. She was giggling and her words were slurred as she said: 

 "I came in to use the potty baby. Have you missed me?" She kissed me and said, "I hope you took your vitamins today baby; you know how horny I get when I smoke. My pussy is dripping baby. You might not even make it home before I rip your clothes off of you. I'm having a great time baby, thank you." 

 She kissed me again and headed back to the parking lot. I guess another forty minutes went by and I hadn't seen Trish so I got up and went looking for her. I was just heading for the door to the parking lot when I saw Trish and Tim come in the door. They were both stumbling along and Trish was giggling and when she saw me she said: 

 "There you are. Come on baby, I want to dance." 

 The band was playing a slow number and Trish was pressing herself into me and telling me that we needed to get out of there and go home. 

 "I'm so horny that if I don't get screwed soon I'm going to die." 

 The song ended and we were walking back to the table when Maggie came up, took Trish by the arm and said: 

 "Come with me girlfriend. I have someone I want you to meet." 

 Maggie led Trish away and I sat down and started talking sports with a couple of guys that I had played high school ball with. I lost track of time and suddenly I realized that it had been over an hour since I'd seen Trish. Maggie was sitting at the table with her husband Bob and her sister and I asked her if she'd seen Trish. 

 "Not since I introduced her to Alice Mayfield. Trish asked me if I knew where she could get some part time work and I knew that Alice was looking for a part time file clerk so I got the two of them together." 

 I walked around the Saddleback and checked out the parking lot, but found no sign of Trish. I headed for the bathrooms and was going to ask some woman to check the ladies room for me to see if Trish was in there, but as I walked down the hallway I heard a squeal from behind a door on my right. I opened the door and with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach I heard Trisha's voice. 

 "Fuck me; oh yes baby, fuck me. Fuck me hard." 

 It was a store room and I saw Trish, legs spread wide and up on the toes of her high heels, bent forward over a stack of beer cases while Tim was fucking her from behind. 

 "Come on baby, fuck me hard. Fuck me hard like you used to." 

 "God Trisha, you are such a slut. 

 "I'm a hot slut baby; fuck me, fuck your hot slut." 

 Tim had his thumb in her asshole and was working it as he fucked Trish and she was moaning: 

 "I'm such a slut; I'm such a dirty slut." 

 About that time Tim realized that someone had opened the door and without turning around or slowing down he said: 

 "Shut the damned door." 

 Trisha cried, "Don't stop baby, don't stop. I'm cumming baby, I'm cumminggggggggggggggggggggg!" 

 I shut the door, rushed to the men's room and tossed my cookies. When I got myself under control I splashed some cold water on my face. I was angry and I was mad enough to kill Tim, but I was also stone cold sober and my mind was working overtime on the situation. I needed answers and I wasn't going to get them kicking down doors and laying waste to the two in the store room. One thing had been burned into my brain and that was when Trish had said: 

 "Fuck me hard like you used to." 

 I went back to our table and sat down. I sat there for about five minutes thinking about what I'd just seen and heard. We hadn't been back in town long enough for it to have been recent so Trisha's "like you used to" probably meant that she had fucked Tim before we moved. The question was was it before we were married or after? If it was before then it was none of my business, but what if it was after? What if it was one those "girls night outs" that she went on with Maggie on the average of once a week. If she did it then did she keep doing it after we moved? Had Trisha been hanging horns on me all those years and I never had a clue? And if she was fucking Tim after we got married and before we moved away was she taking back up with him now? Or was what just happened an alcohol and pot fueled aberration? Was Trisha stoned out of her skull and not aware of what she was doing? 

 I was sitting there and thinking those things when Maggie came up leading Trisha who was very unsteady on her feet, 

 "I found her in the ladies room and I do believe that my girlfriend is seriously stoned." 

 Trish bent down and drunkenly whispered in my ear, "Get me out of here baby. I'm horny and I need your dick." 

 I thanked Maggie for throwing the party for us and then I helped Trish out to the car. I was no sooner in the car and behind the wheel than Trish was next to me and pulling down my zipper. She worked out my cock, bent her head and took me in her mouth and then she started to suck me off. I love the feel of Trisha's mouth on me and I love the way she sucks my cock and that was one of the reasons I had not gone after Tim and beat the fuck out of him. If I had gone after the asshole everything would have been out in the open. Trish would know that I had seen her with another man's cock in her and that I had heard her begging him to fuck her harder and I don't believe that our marriage could have survived that. For one thing I doubt that she would ever been able to look me in the eye again without feeling shame. 

 I loved her and I really did not want to lose her and I really believed that I could get by a one time drugged and drunken indiscretion. As long as she didn't know that I knew I thought we might have a chance. 

 But! And it was a pretty big but. What if what had happened was not a one time thing but a continuation of something that had gone on before we moved and after we had married? Other questions that I had no answers for were did Maggie find Trish in the ladies room or did she go to the store room to get Trish because I started looking for her? Did she take Trish to meet Alice Mayfield or did she take Trish to the store room where Tim was waiting for her? 

 Why was I thinking those thoughts about Maggie? Because of all the girls nights out that she had gone on with Trish and because of Trish telling Tim to do her hard like he "used to." 

 I really wanted to believe that Trish was "out of it" so it was easy for me to believe that she was "led" into that store room and Maggie was the last person I saw with Trish before I saw Trish bent over those beer cases and when I saw her she was "leading" Trish away. Maybe I wasn't being fair to Maggie. Maybe she did take Trish to meet the Mayfield woman and then Tim had caught her and led her to the store room. I could never know unless I asked Trish and I couldn't do that because then she would know that I knew what she had done or if she hadn't known what she was doing she would want to know what the hell I was talking about. 

 As soon as we were in the garage Trish was trying to open the door and was saying, "Hurry baby, hurry. I'm horny baby and I need it." Luckily the kids were staying the night with Trisha's folks so they wouldn't see their mother in the condition she was in. I helped her into the bedroom and as soon as we were there she pulled away from me and started taking off her clothes. When her panties hit the floor I saw that the crotch was soaking wet. That Trish could just drop them in front of me when they were in that condition and be so ready to make love to me while she was still leaking Tim's juices was just one more thing that led me to believe that she was still so out of it that she didn't know what was going on. I mean what just fucked woman was going to willingly fuck her significant other knowing that she was still leaking the cum of her lover? 

 Once stripped Trish turned and pulled down the bed covers and as she did I saw a trace of cum running down the inside of her left thigh. It was sick of me and I know it, but suddenly I wanted to know what my wife would feel like after just having been fucked by another man. While Trish got on the bed, laid back and spread her legs I quickly undressed and got on the bed. Normally when Trish and I make love I start by eating her pussy and when I got between her legs her hands went to my head to guide me down. I don't know if it was just reflex because that was the way we always did it or because she knew she was full of another man and wanted to see what it would be like to have me taste him, but I wasn't going to go there. No way! I might have been sick enough to want to know what it would be like to take sloppy seconds, but I was in no way curious about what she would taste like.  

 

 ****** Tricia's Dirty Hole ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© My cock slid right in and I bottomed out on the first stroke. She was wet! Not "moist" wet, but "slick" wet if you know what I mean. As soon as I was in her she went wild. She bucked, pushed up at me, dug her nails in my ass as she tried to pull me even deeper into her and her heels beat bruises into the backs of my legs. When I finally came she pushed me off of her, spun around and took my cock in her mouth and sucked me hard again and then she mounted me. She bounced up and down on me until I was so close I had to roll her over onto her back and fuck her hard to get myself off. When I fell to the bed beside her she made as if to go after my cock and I pushed her hand away and told her that I was done. 

 Trish was softly snoring beside me while I was staring up at the ceiling thinking about the night. I desperately wanted to believe that what happened that night was a one time thing, but in the end I knew that I was going to have to find out for sure. Since I didn't dare bring it up with Trish that meant that I was going to have to spy on her and the very thought of having to do that weighed heavily on me. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 When I woke up in the morning I had a plan. I didn't know if it was workable, but I would find out. I had just finished reading a spy novel where the protagonist had bugged a house using stuff he had purchased at Wal-Mart. He described how he did it and if it was as easy as he made it sound I thought that it was something that I could do. 

 I was up bright and early and was standing at the front door of Radio Shack when they opened and I told the salesman what I wanted to do and he said, "No problem" and sold me what I needed and told me the best way to do what I wanted. By the time Trish got out of bed at ten to ten I had a voice activated tape recorder hooked into the phone line, one hidden in the kitchen close to the phone and one hidden in the bedroom. 

 Trish woke up with one hell of a hang over and she downed two cups of hot black coffee before she asked: 

 "Was I too bad last night?" 

 "You don't remember?" 

 "I remember doing shots of tequila and going out to the parking lot to do some killer grass with Tim." 

 "Well, you danced a lot and with a lot of different guys, but I don't think you did anything that you need to be ashamed of. If you did, you didn't do it where I could see it. Do you remember talking to Alice Mayfield about a job?" 

 "Alice who?" 

 "Alice Mayfield. Maggie said she introduced the two of you because you want a part time job and Alice was looking for a part time file clerk." 

 "Oh God, I don't remember any of it. I'll have to call Maggs and ask her." 

 I kissed her and said, "You do that. I've got to run to the hardware store for some wood screws. I'll be back in a bit. Do you need anything while I'm out?" 

 "Just a new head; one that doesn't throb." 

 I went to Home Depot and got the wood screws I needed, checked on a few other things and went home. There was a note on the kitchen table telling me that Trish had gone to pick up the kids. Since I was alone I checked the recorder hooked to the phone line and found that Trish had called Maggie while I was gone. 

 "That was some party that you had for us last night. I haven't let myself go like that since before Rob and I got married." 

 "You did seem a little tense when you first got back. I'm glad you had a good time." 

 "Did I have a good time? I really don't remember much of it after Tim and I started smoking." 

 "Oh you had a good time sweetie; in fact you had a great time. How is Rob acting today?" 

 "Why would you ask that?" 

 "You did spend a lot of time with Tim. Is Rob the jealous type?" 

 "Why would he be jealous of Tim? All we did was smoke some grass." 

 "You really don't remember?" 

 "Remember what?" 

 "You don't remember sucking Tim's cock in the parking lot or letting him fuck you in one of the Saddleback's store rooms?" 

 "I did what?" 

 "You sucked Tim's cock in the parking lot, twice that I know of, and then you fucked him in one of the back rooms." 

 "I couldn't have. I wouldn't have. I would never cheat on Rob." 

 "Sweetie, I saw you sucking Tim's cock two separate times. I kept an eye on you all night. I know how you get when you mix alcohol and dope so I was keeping an eye on you and on Rob so I could intercept him if he went looking for you." 

 "Oh God Maggs, please tell me that you are kidding me." 

 "I'm not girlfriend. You might not remember it, but you sure as hell were loving it." 

 "Oh Jesus. Are you sure that Rob doesn't know?" 

 "I don't think he knows, but that's why I asked you how he was acting this morning." 

 "He seems normal. He hasn't said or done anything to make me think he knows I was bad." 

 Maggie laughed and said, "You weren't bad sweetie; in fact Tim said you were damned good and I won't be surprised if you hear from him soon asking for a repeat." 

 "Oh shit Maggs. What am I going to do?" 

 "What ever you want to do girlfriend." 

 "I don't want a repeat with Tim. I didn't want a first time with Tim. I love Rob and if he ever finds out he will throw me out on my ass. Is Tim the kind of guy who brags? Is there any chance he will spread it around? God Maggs, I don't know what I'll do if it gets back to Rob." 

 "You would know more about whether Tim brags than I would." 

 "Why do you say that?" 

 "Have you forgotten that you fucked him damned near every night for two months during one of your separations from Rob? If that didn't get back to Rob I wouldn't think that what you did last night will get back to him either." 

 "Tim fucked me? Are you sure about that or did he tell you that after I'd gone." 

 "Dead sure Trish. I saw him doing it to you. He had you bent over a stack of beer cases taking you from behind and you were loving it." 

 "Oh my God Maggs, I don't remember any of it. I know I did kiss Tim a couple of times, but that was game playing." 

 "Game playing?" 

 "You know, where you take a big hit on the joint, put your mouth on some one else's and then exhale while the other person inhales." 

 "The only thing I saw you inhaling girlfriend was Tim's dick." 

 "I can't believe that I don't remember any of it." 

 "All I know sweetie is that you did it and you sure acted like you were loving it." 

 "Did I do anything else stupid? Am I going to be able to face people?" 

 "I didn't see you do anything else bad unless you count all the times guys felt you up on the dance floor. You didn't fight any of them off, but I did notice that you never let any of them get you off into a dark corner and I saw several who tried. But don't sweat that sweetie; that happens at all the dances and no one gets shook up about it." 

 "What else happened that I don't remember?" 

 "I don't know sweetie." 

 "Rob says you introduced me to an Alice Mayfield who might have a job for me?" 

 "There is no Alice Mayfield sweetie. That is just what I told Rob when he started wondering where you were." 

 "Rob said you came and got me to meet somebody?" 

 "I did sweetie. I took you to the store room where Tim was waiting." 

 "You led me to him knowing that I was fucked up that he was going to take advantage of that and fuck me?" 

 "He couldn't very well come and get you himself." 

 "Why would you do something like that to me?" 

 "Because I thought you needed it." 

 "It didn't bother you that you might be fucking up my marriage? What if Rob had caught me doing it? What if Tim brags about it and Rob hears about it? I thought you were my friend Maggie, but friends don't fuck with their friend's lives." 

 The conversation stopped as Trish hung up on Maggie. As I stared at the recorder I was somewhat relieved to know that Trish didn't do what she did knowingly, the sex part anyway, but now I had new worries. Maggie said Tim would probably be calling wanting an encore and I wondered what Trish might do if that happened. Especially after Maggie reminded her that she had spent a couple of months fucking Tim before we were married. All I could do was wait, watch Trish and see what happened. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Trish got home with the kids and then started dinner. For the rest of the day until we went to bed every time I looked Trisha's way I caught her looking at me and I knew that she was wondering if I knew about what she had done at the party. In bed that night she was insatiable and I knew that it was because she was feeling guilty and was trying to make it up to me for being unfaithful. It was a week before she stopped eying nervously and I figured that she had finally decided that I knew nothing. 

 I checked the hidden tape recorders daily, but there was never anything on the bedroom recorder except normal noises and Trish and I talking. There was an erotic moment or two when I listened to Trish and me making love. The kitchen recorder had nothing on it except the sounds of Trish making breakfast, lunch and dinner and other normal noises. The phone tap always had something, her mother, her sister, telemarketers and the like. Maggie called daily, sometimes twice, but Trish hung up on her every time. 

 Tim's phone call came on a Wednesday. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hi sugar, it's Tim." 

 "What do you want Tim?" 

 "I'd kinda like picking up where we left off the night of the party." 

 "I'm sorry Tim, but that was a big mistake on my part. It can't happen again." 

 "You trying to tell me that you didn't enjoy it?" 

 "I was stoned Tim. I don't even remember it." 

 "Oh come on sugar, you told me that you loved it. You told me that you never wanted to stop. You even told me that you wanted me in your ass. You said you wanted me in your 'dirty hole' and I was just getting ready to do it there when Maggie came in and pulled you away because your hubby was looking for you. As you left you said "next time; you can do my dirty hole next time." So what do you say sugar? How about tonight?" 

 "No Tim, and please don't call me again." 

 If I hadn't seen Tim fucking Trish with my own eyes that call would have told me all I needed to know about Trish being unfaithful. Whenever we had anal sex Trish always referred to her ass as her 'dirty hole'. It was always "fuck my dirty hole" or "cum in my dirty hole" or "I want you in my dirty hole tonight." Tim knowing that would have been all the proof I would have needed. 

 He called again on Friday. 

 "Hi sugar." 

 "I told you not to call me again." 

 "I know sugar, but I know that you really didn't mean it. You loved what we did and I know you are going to want to do it again. I'll just keep calling until you say yes." 

 "Fuck you, you bastard!" and she hung up on him. 

 True to his word he called back on Monday, Wednesday and both times Trish hung up on him as soon as he said, "Hi sugar." 

 I really wanted to go find Tim and rip him a new asshole, but if I did that Trish would know that I knew about what she'd done and I didn't want that. I really believed that I could handle it if it was only a one time thing and that Trish never knew that I knew. If she knew that I knew that night would achieve the status of "elephant in the room that we all tried to ignore but couldn't." But I desperately needed to know that it was only a one time thing and the only way I could find that out was to continue to watch, listen and hope. 

 Tim called regular as clock work on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and most of the time Trish would hang up immediately when she heard the sound of his voice. The few times that she didn't hang up she asked him please not to call her and his answer was always the same. 

 "You know you want it sugar and I'll keep calling until you say yes." 

 Two weeks went by and then the recorder hidden in the kitchen had something for me. The voices were faint, but got louder and then I heard 

 "...don't even know why I let you in the door." 

 "Sure you do sweetie" Maggie said, "You're my best friend and you can't stay mad at me." 

 "Some best friend you are. Setting me up so that asshole Tim could fuck me." 

 "Oh give me a break Trish. I thought you wanted it. Tim wasn't pushing your head down on his cock when you were sucking him off in the parking lot. He never put a hand on your head either time I saw you. How was I supposed to know that you didn't know what you were doing. And I didn't set you up for Tim to fuck you. Tim told me that you told him that you would fuck him if he could find a safer place than the parking lot. He couldn't come and get you so he asked me to. From everything I saw that night I thought you wanted it. Add to that you were fucking him before you got married so I figured that you knew what you were getting into. It wasn't my fault Trisha; I was just doing what I thought you wanted." 

 "Well I didn't want it and now the asshole won't leave me alone." 

 "What do you mean he won't leave you alone?" 

 "What I mean Maggs is that he calls me two or three times a week trying to get me to meet him. He even caught me at Wal-Mart last Saturday and tried to get me to go out to his van with him. I keep saying no and hanging up on him, but he won't leave me alone. If he keeps it up sooner or later something is going to tip off Rob that something happened and then Rob will go after it like a dog after a bone until he knows everything. I can't have that Maggs; I just can't have that." 

 "I didn't know Tim was doing that. Don't sweat it any more sweetie, I'll take care of it." 

 "You will? How can you do that?" 

 "I know where some skeletons are in Tim's closet and I'll just drop a hint that some of them just might see the light of day if he doesn't back off." 

 The rest of the tape was just the two of them catching up on gossip and Maggie asking Trish if she were up to a girl's night out. Trish said she was and I didn't really know how I felt about that. A girl's night out with the woman who had led Trish to Tim like a lamb led to the slaughter? 

 x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Whatever dirt that Maggie had on Tim must have been potent because the phone calls to Trish stopped. For the next two weeks there was nothing on the recorders except normal stuff. Well, maybe not completely normal. The kitchen recorder and the phone tap had a lot of Trish and Maggie gossiping. I found out lots of stuff that I really didn't need to know. Things like Estelle Byrns was cheating on her husband with Billy Martin and everyone thought that Estelle's last two kids were Billy's and not her husbands. I found out that Ralph Evers had picked up a social disease somewhere and had given it to his wife and when she found out she had fractured his skull with a cast iron frying pan. Christy Peters went off to an exclusive boarding school because it was supposed be the best prep school for what she was going to take in college, but "everyone knew" that Christy had been sent out of town because she was pregnant and wouldn't be back home until after she had delivered. Bob Thomas had until Friday to pay up his back taxes or the IRS was going to seize his business. 

 I stopped checking the tapes daily and only checked them once or twice a week. Trish and Maggie got in the habit of going out for their girls night out on Wednesdays and Trish almost always wanted to make love when she got home and no, she hadn't been laid while she was out. I knew what sloppy seconds felt like since I did her after Tim did her at the party and she never felt like that. 

 I got to where I only checked the recorders to make sure that the tapes hadn't run out. We had dodged the bullet; our marriage was going to survive. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 I listened to the tape from the bedroom recorder with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

 "Oh God yes you bastard, fuck me, fuck me hard. Pound my pussy! Harder damn you, harder. Cum in me you bastard, fill me, push it deep in me." 

 I had just returned from a four day business trip, the first one that I'd been on since moving back and I was checking the tapes out of habit. The phone tap had given me a pretty good idea of what I was going to find on the bedroom recorder. 

 "He's gone for four days and three nights and the kids are spending the night at my mom's." 

 "What time do you want me there?" 

 "Half an hour ago." 

 "On the way sugar." 

 On the tape Trish screamed out. "I'm cumming, fuck me harder, I'm cumming" and then several sharp little cries that I'd never heard before. Heavy breathing and then: 

 "God but you are such a slut." 

 "I know baby, but that's what you like about me isn't it?" 

 "No it isn't. What I love about fucking you is that you are another man's wife. I love fucking married sluts." 

 "Well you aren't done fucking this slut yet. I want you to do my dirty hole now." 

 "If you want that you had better get down there and wake Tim junior up." 

 "I can do that baby. I love the way your cock tastes with my juices on it." 

 "If you love it so much why won't you let me have your pussy on Wednesday nights? Why do you only let me have your ass?" 

 "Because Rob isn't stupid. If he fucks me right after you he would know that he wasn't the first one there. He never does my dirty hole unless I ask him to so he will never know that you have played there." 

 "Just don't fuck him after you've been with me." 

 "Can't say no to him lover. He is my hubby and he does have certain rights." 

 The sounds of sucking followed by, "Oh yeah baby, push it deep. Fuck my dirty hole lover, fuck my dirty hole hard." 

 The tape ran out before they finished, but Tim fucked her four times that I heard and it was obvious that he was spending the night. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x 

 I was parked behind Tim's car when he got off work. I let him reach the door before I got out of my car and walked up to him. He turned and saw me and the look that came over his face told me that he knew what I had planned for him. He tried to back up but I was too close. I hit him and blood flew out of his nose. His hands went up to his face and I kneed him in the nuts and when he doubled over I grabbed him, spun him around and then slammed his face into the hood of his car several times and watched the blood and teeth fly out of his mouth and then I spun him back around. I kneed him twice more and then let him fall to the ground. And then I started kicking him. The entire time I was yelling: 

 "Like to fuck married women huh? Get your kicks fucking married sluts do you? How do you like these kicks you rotten motherfucker?" 

 I must have gotten seven or eight kicks into his crotch and ribs before I was pulled off of him. I tried to pull loose, but three guys were holding me. As the rage started to bleed out of me I saw that I had drawn a crowd and then some one clapped and soon everyone was clapping and yelling things like "Way to go" and "About time some one did that." One of the guys holding me said: 

 "I don't know why the asshole hit you buddy, but you did a hell of a job defending yourself." 

 Some one had called the cops and when they showed up one of the guys who had pulled me off of Tim said: 

 "I saw the whole thing officer. This guy walked up to Tim and started to say something and Tim hit him for no reason. This guy just defended himself." 

 Tim must not have had any friends there that day because two more people stepped up and said the same thing. The cop taking the report looked at me and I said: 

 "I found out that the asshole was fucking my wife and I came down her to tell him to stay away from her and before I could say anything he swung at me and I fought back." 

 While all that was going on the paramedics showed up, loaded Tim on a stretcher, put him in the ambulance and hauled him away. 

 x-x-x-x-x-x-x 

 Trish had dinner ready when I got home. I didn't say anything to Trish; I just sat down and ate. I talked with the kids about how there day went and after dinner I helped the two youngest with their homework. That done I went down to my basement workshop to putter around until bedtime. 

 When I walked into the bedroom I found Trish in my favorite black lace nightgown. Normally I would have started stripping my clothes off with a huge smile on my face, but this time all I did was take my wallet out of my pocket, take a twenty out of it and hand it to Trish.  

 

 ****** Tricia's Dirty Hole ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "What's this for?" 

 "You need to hit a flower shop and order some flowers." 

 "Why? What for?" 

 "So you can send them to Tim at the hospital. I hear he has a broken jaw, nine missing teeth, two broken ribs, a couple of cracked ones and they are thinking they may have to remove his testicles because they got stomped pretty bad." 

 When I said that Trisha's face lost some of its color and she said, "Why would I want to send Tim flowers?" 

 "I thought he meant something to you." 

 "Why on Earth would you think something like that?" 

 "Oh I don't know; maybe this gave me the idea" and I took the cassette recorder out of my top dresser drawer and pushed in the play button. 

 "What time do you want me there?" 

 "Half an hour ago." 

 "On the way sugar." 

 "There are some pretty good parts about your "dirty hole" toward the end of the tape." I tossed the recorder to her and said, "Here, you can have this one. I've got plenty of copies." 

 I took my PJs out of the dresser and headed for the spare bedroom. When I got to the bedroom door I turned and said: 

 "You'll notice I didn't grab my pillow. That's because the dirt bag probably used it when he spent the night. Or was it nights? I'll use the spare bedroom tonight and look for an apartment tomorrow." I gave her a look that should have killed her and then I turned and left the room. 

 She was up and had the coffee made when I got down to the kitchen in the morning. As I poured myself a cup she said: 

 "Before you go any farther with this apartment nonsense we need to talk." 

 "We have nothing to talk about Trisha. You stabbed me in the back, you got caught, and we are history. Nothing to talk about! The end!" 

 "Bullshit Rob. You can't just toss sixteen years of a good marriage into the trash can because I had a little fun." 

 "In the first place Trisha I didn't toss anything into the trash - you did! All I'm doing is refusing to reach into that trash can and pull the marriage back out. You can't possibly have known me for as long as you have and believe that I would just accept what you did if you got caught. You should have known that there was no way in hell that I was going to say, "Well okay Trish; just don't let it happen again. No way that life was going to continue on as usual. You had to know that." 

 "It is still a good marriage Rob, okay, so I did play around with Tim, but have I been any less of a wife to you? I've been a loving wife and I've shown it ever day. I love you and you know it! Tim was never a danger to you. He was a toy. He was just someone who could do something for me that I liked." 

 "And what was that?" 

 "It's a woman thing Rob and you wouldn't understand." 

 "Try me." 

 "It would just make things worse Rob." 

 "Trisha, right now is as bad as it can possibly get. Nothing you can say can possibly make it any worse." 

 "You are a man Rob and men have fragile egos when it comes to some things; especially when it comes to things involving sex." 

 "We are worried about egos now? Like I'm not already wondering why I couldn't keep my wife to myself? Like I'm not already wondering why I seem to have failed to do my best to take care of your sexual needs? How can you trash me more than you already have?" 

 "You have never failed to take care of my needs Rob, not ever. I love the way you make love to me. Tim just happened to be able to give me something that you couldn't; not that you wouldn't have if you were able, but you don't have what Tim does Rob. It is all about cock size and you had no control over that. You have what you have and there is no way you can change that and even if you could I wouldn't want you to. Just like Tim's cock can do things for me that you can't, you do things to me that Tim couldn't even come close to. My problem is that I wanted both and I thought that I could have both. As long as I kept Tim hidden away from you I could have my cake and eat it too." 

 "Cock size huh?" 

 "Yes Rob, cock size. We have never been kinky with each other so we never measured your cock or even talked about it. I would guess that you are about six inches." 

 "Six and three quarters. There isn't a man alive that hasn't checked himself out at one time or another." 

 "Well Tim is nine inches long. I never measured him either, but he always brought it up like he was proud of it. That extra length meant that he was able to touch me in places you couldn't and one of those places just happened to be a place that if touched drove me out of my mind. His cock curved upward like a banana and it had a slight bend to the left - all things that put him at that special place. But length wasn't all of it Rob. His cock was skinny like a hot dog. It was absolutely perfect for fucking my dirty hole. You know how much I like anal sex, but you always hesitate to do me there because you know your fat cock hurts me when we first start. The pain goes away after a bit, but you don't even like hurting me for that short period of time and I love you for feeling that way about me. Tim's hot dog sized cock slides right into my dirty hole nice and easy and he likes my dirty hole. I think he likes my dirty hole even more than my pussy. That's why I saw Tim. Not because I didn't love you or the way you loved me, but because I got something from him that I could not physically get from you. Like I said Rob, I wanted both. What I did with Tim in no way diminishes what I feel for you. I've been a good wife to you Rob and nothing that Tim and I did has changed that." 

 "Maybe not in your mind Trisha, but in my mind you betrayed me; you stabbed me in the back. You trashed me Trisha. Let me try to put this on a simple level, a level you might be able to understand. Ignore that it is chauvinistic sounding, but I need to make a point here. I earned the right to your love Trisha. I bought it. I paid for it. I've worked my ass off to give you a good life; to provide for you and give you the things you wanted. I earned the right to your body. Did Tim do anything to earn what you gave him? 

 "On another level, who waited on you hand and foot and took care of you and pampered you when you broke your ankle skiing? Was it me or was it Tim? Who was with you holding your hand and trying to comfort you when you went through the birth of our children? Was it me or was it Tim? When your brother died who held you while you sobbed and cried and who did his best to help you get by it? Was it me or was it Tim? Who scrimped and saved up the money to take you to Cabo San Lucas for two weeks? You enjoyed it so much that all you have talked about for years now is going back there again. But who got you there Trisha? Was it me or was it Tim? 

 "Speaking of that vacation I can use it to draw a parallel. Do you remember how I got the money to take you to Cabo? Remember the glass jar that sat on the end of the dresser that I put all the change I had in my pocket in at the end of the day? When it was full we took it to the bank and put it into a separate savings account for vacations only, remember that? I worked for the money that I dropped in that jar. What you did was the same as letting Tim walk into our bedroom and help himself to a handful of that change. My change. Money that I had earned. Actually it was much worse that just letting Tim take a handful of what I had worked for. What you did was pick up the jar and hold it out to him and say: 

 "Here, help yourself." 

 "The sad thing is that I almost let you get away with it." 

 "If you could almost do it why can't you do it now?" 

 "Because I convinced myself that if it was only a one time mistake I could live with it. But it isn't a one time thing and that makes all the difference in the world." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "I saw you and Tim in that store room the night of the party. The two of you forgot to lock the door you were in such a hurry to get it on. I knew you were stoned out of your mind and probably didn't realize what you were doing and I loved you enough that I believed that I could put it behind me if it was only a one time thing. But I had to know that it was one time only and the only way I could do that was to spy on you. I hid voice activated tape recorders in the house and I was almost at the point where I was going to turn them off, but then I went on my trip and you brought that asshole into my house and then welcomed him to join you on my bed. If you hadn't of brought him home with you I would have never known. But you did bring him home and the bedroom tape recorder caught it all, including the part about you fucking him every Wednesday night on your so called girl's night out." 

 I finished my coffee and stood up. 

 "Where are you going Rob? We have to work this out." 

 "In case you have forgotten Trisha, I do have a job I have to go to. And I need to find a good attorney and an apartment." 

 When I got to the door I stopped and turned back to Trisha. "There is one thing I'd like to know. I know you fucked Tim almost nightly for almost two months during one of our break ups, but did you keep seeing him after we got back together?" 

 "Of course not! Why would you even think something like that?" 

 I could see from her face and tell from the tone of her voice that she was lying. 

 "Guess I'll have to have DNA tests done on Chris since he was born before we moved. Probably wouldn't hurt to check the others since God and you alone know who might have taken Tim's place after we moved." 

 She reacted as if I had slapped her face. 

 "That was cold and cruel Rob." 

 "You earned it Trisha." 

 I left the house and went to work. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I called around and got some recommendations on attorneys and called one of them and made an appointment and then I took the afternoon off and checked out some apartments. I found a nice two bedroom and signed a six month lease and then I went home and started to pack. Trisha came into the room and watched me for a minute and then said: 

 "You are really going to do it?" 

 "Yep! Found me an apartment and I can move in tomorrow." 

 "You aren't even going to try to save our marriage?" 

 "I can't stand to look at you Trisha. Just hearing the sound of your voice reminds me of what you did and that turns my stomach." 

 "I'm not giving up Rob. I'll fight you if you try to divorce me. I love you and I know you love me. I won't let you go." 

 "Wrong Trisha. I loved you - past tense - and now I can't stand the sight of you. You won't fight me, at least not if you know what's good for you. As it stands right now my plan is to let you keep the house until the kids start college and then it will be sold and we will split what we get out of it. I'll pay whatever the court orders in the way of child support and I will ask for shared custody. I don't want the kids to suffer any more than is necessary for your unfaithfulness, but fight me and the first thing I will do is sit the kids down and tell them in detail why we are getting the divorce and then I will play the tape for them." 

 "You hate me that much?" 

 "I'm working on it. Also, the courts in this state allow children over thirteen to express a preference as to which parent they would like to live with. That mans Chris and Bobby will get to chose. Megan still has two years to go before she can choose, but you want to bet which way Chris and Bobby will go? Especially after listening to you and Tim on tape? I believe that they need to be with their mother as long as I'm allowed to be a strong presence in their lives, but if you fight me get ready to see me be Attila the Hun pursuing a scorched earth policy. 

 "Fighting the divorce gets you nothing. You can not get me to stay and try to make it work with you. Get it fixed firmly in your head Trisha; it doesn't matter what you want because I want absolutely nothing to do with you anymore. You are a cheap piece of trash as far as I am concerned and the very sight of you disgusts me." 

 Trisha didn't fight the divorce and it became final yesterday. Report_Story
