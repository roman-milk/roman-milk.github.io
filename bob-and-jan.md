 ****** Bob and Jan ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "Kids are great ain't they? You never know what the little buggers are going to say. A little boy was attending his first wedding and after the service his cousin asked him: 

 "How many women can marry a man?" 

 "Sixteen" the boy responded. His cousin was amazed that he had the answer so quickly. 

 "How do you know that?" 

 "Easy" the little boy said. "All you have to do is add it up like the pastor said: 

 4 better, 4 worse, 4 richer and 4 poorer." 

 A boy was watching his father, a pastor, write a sermon. "How do you know what to say" he asked. 

 "God tells me." 

 "Oh? Then why do you keep crossing things out?" 

 A little girl was in Sunday school class and the Sunday school teacher asked: 

 "Now Susie, tell me frankly, do you say prayers before eating?" 

 "No sir" little Susie replied. "I don't have to. My mom is a good cook." 

 And finally, a little girl was sitting on her grandfather's lap as he read her a bedtime story. From time to time she would take her eyes off the book and reach up and touch his wrinkled cheek while she was alternately stroking her own. Finally she spoke up and asked: 

 "Grandpa, did God make you?" 

 "Yes sweetheart" he answered, "God made me a long, long time ago." 

 "Did God make me too?" 

 "Oh yes indeed honey" the old man replied. "He made you just a little while ago." 

 Feeling their respective faces again she observed, "God's getting better at it isn't he?" 

 As I laughed along with the rest of the patrons I thought back on the series of evens that brought me back to the Landing Strip lounge on open mike night. It was here that it all started. Well no, not actually; it was here that it exploded on us. It really started the day that Jan came to work for the company where I worked. 

 Jan was a beautiful sexy looking woman with a husband and four kids. I fully admit that I fell instantly in lust with Jan, but I guess that I'm kind of a weird duck in that I won't go after married women no matter how many iron bar hard ons they give me, but on the other hand I'd fuck a married woman in a heartbeat if she makes the first move. Jan never made that move even though I flirted with her outrageously. 

 I met her family at the company picnic and her husband seemed nice enough, but he was overweight, balding and judging from the way he handled the beer at the picnic he was probably a bit of a drunk. Just didn't make sense to me, but then what did I know? Jan could have been a size queen and her husband might have a ten inch dick. Whatever. It didn't stop me from flirting with her. 

 At the company Christmas party he was two-thirds into the bag forty-five minutes into the party and it gave him three left feet if you take my meaning and Jan loved to dance so I elected myself to see to it that she got as much floor time as she wanted. There were lots of slow dances and during them I held Jan close. I did mention that she was sexy right? Well holding her close had the effect on me that you would expect and several times Jan came in contact with my hard on. She never said a word, but she didn't pull away either. 

 About two hours into the party I was dancing with her when the music ended. We stopped where we were and waited for the next number to start and while waiting she asked: 

 "Well?" 

 "Well what?" 

 "Look where we are." 

 I looked around and saw nothing out of the ordinary and she giggled and said: 

 "Look up." 

 I looked up and saw that we were standing under a clump of mistletoe. "Give you any ideas?" Jan asked. I looked over at our table and her husband was passed out. 

 "Don't be looking over there. I'm here." 

 So I kissed her. She surprised me by giving me some tongue so I gave a little back. Then the music started again and we went back to dancing. Twice she steered me under a clump of mistletoe and both times I kissed her I got tongue. I began to think that Jan was telling me that she wanted to play. Of course I couldn't do anything that night because her husband was there, but now that I had gotten the signal there would be other times and I just hoped they would be soon. 

 The party was on a Friday night and so it was Monday before I saw Jan again. About an hour after start time Jan and I were walking toward each other and we met almost in front of the door to the conference room. It was spur of the moment on my part and I grabbed her arm, opened the conference room door and pulled her inside. I pulled her into my arms and bent to kiss her, but she pushed me away as she said: 

 "Hold on there bucko; there isn't any mistletoe here in this room." 

 It suddenly occurred to me that I had misread what had happened at the party. Thinking fast I reached up and ran my hand through my hair and then said: 

 "Damn it! It must have fallen off. I knew I should have borrowed a hairpin to hold it in place. Now I have to go find where I lost it" and I got the hell out of the room. 

 I steered clear of Jan for a couple of days and then we gradually started flirting again. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Several months went by and then I was offered a position that came with more money and better benefits at another company. The group at my old company threw me a going away party at the Landing Strip Lounge. Why they chose the Strip on open mike night I never knew, but the night became so special to me that I've not forgotten any of the jokes I heard that night. 

 At the party Jan told me that she was going to miss me. 

 "I'm going to miss you too. The best part of coming to work every day was seeing you and spending time trying to think of ways to get you to be my girlfriend." 

 "All you had to do was ask." 

 "Really?" 

 "You bet. I've been wanting to be your girlfriend, but you never asked." 

 "No joking here girl; I'm serious." 

 "No joke. You never asked." 

 "Will you be my girlfriend even though I won't be working here any more?" 

 "You bet." 

 "My girlfriend would go to a motel with me if I wanted to go." 

 "Now or at the end of the party?" 

 "I'd say right now. Before you have a chance to change your mind." 

 "We can't Bob. This is your party and you need to stay and I'm not going to change my mind. But we won't be going to a motel. Dave is out of town and the kids are visiting my mom for the weekend." 

 "I can't believe it. I've wanted you since the day I met you and all I had to do was ask?" 

 "Yep. And it had to be you doing the asking. If I'd have done the asking all I'd have been in your eyes is just another married slut." 

 "I don't want to wait for the party to end. I want to get you out of here right now." 

 "No baby; we have all night. Sit back and enjoy your party." 

 She was right. I did owe it to the people who thought enough of me to throw me a party so I took a sip of my drink and turned toward the band stand. Bobby Dalton was the MC and as was his natural bent he told a blond joke before introducing the next wanna be stand up comic. His wife Bree was sitting at a back table with some of her friends and every one there knew that Bree hated blond jokes. I wondered if he ever got laid on open mike nights. Hell, I wondered if Bree gave him anything for days after open mike night. After a quick look back at his wife he began: 

 "A blond, out of money and down on her luck after buying air at a real bargain price, needed money desperately. To raise cash she decided to kidnap a child and hold it for ransom. 

 She went to the local playground, grabbed a kid at random, took her behind a building and told her, "I've kidnapped you." 

 She then wrote a big note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning put $10,000 in a paper bag and leave it under the apple tree next to the slides on the south side of the park. Signed, A Blond. 

 The blond then pinned the note on the little girl's blouse and sent her home to show it to her parents. The next morning she checked and sure enough there was a paper bag sitting beneath the apple tree. The blond looked in the bag and found $10,000 along with a note that said: 

 "Shame on you. How could you do this to another blond?" 

 He finished, thanked everybody for the applause and then introduced Shelly Falken who was a hairdresser by day. She took the mike from Bobby and then said: 

 "Blond men aren't all that bright Bobby. A friend told a blond man that Christmas was on a Friday that year and the blond man said, "Let's just hope it isn't on the thirteenth." 

 Two blond men find three hand grenades and they decide to take them to the police station. One asked, "What if one explodes before we get there" and the other said, "We'll lie and say we only found two." 

 Blond man spies a letter lying on his doormat. It says on the envelope "DO NOT BEND" and he spent the next two hours trying to figure out how to pick it up. 

 A blond man's dog went missing and he was frantic. His wife said "Why don't you put an ad in the paper." He does, but two weeks later the dog is still missing. "What did you put in the paper?" his wife asked. "Here boy!" he replied. 

 A blond man shouts frantically into the phone, "My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart." "Is this her first child?" the doctor asked. "No" he shouts, this is her husband." 

 A blond hillbilly won a bass boat in a local raffle. He brought it home and his wife looks at it and then says to him, "Whatcha gonna do with that there thing. There ain't no water within two hunert miles of here." 

 He says to her, "I won it and I'm a-gonna keep it." 

 His brother, also a blond, came over several days later, saw the wife and asked where his brother was. "He be out there in his bass boat" she said pointing to the field out behind the barn. The brother looks out to the field and sees his brother in the middle of the field sitting in a boat with a fishing rod in his hand. He yelled out to him: "What in all tarnation are you doing out there?" 

 His brother replied, "What the hell does it look like I'm a-doin. I'm fishen." 

 His brother yelled back at him, "Its fools like you that give us folks from West Virginia a bad name and makin ever body think we're stupid. If I could swim I'd come out there and whip you." 

 She got a big laugh and about then the party started breaking up and people started leaving and finally it was just Jan and me. "Now?" I asked. 

 She laughed and said, "It does a girl good to know her guy is so eager for her. Let's go." 

 As soon as we were in my car I leaned over and kissed her. She kissed me back and my hands started to wander over her body. She was forty-one to my thirty- two and she'd had four kids, but you couldn't tell. I ran a hand under her sweater and worked my hand under her bra. Her nipples were hard and I took one and rolled it between my fingers. She moaned and pushed me away and hen reached over and unzipped me. She worked my hard cock out and bent her head and took me in her mouth. She sucked me and I slid a hand up her leg and my fingers found her soaking wet pussy. I started to work a finger into her, but she pulled away and said: 

 "Not here. Not in a parking lot. Get me home." 

 She sat next to me and stroked my cock as we drove and I told her that if she kept that up: 

 "I'm going to blow and it will get all over your clothes." 

 "No it won't. Just tell me when you're ready." 

 I got maybe a mile more down the road before I said' "Here it comes." 

 She bent her head, took my cock in her mouth just as I erupted and she swallowed every last drop. When she came up she said: 

 "That gets the first quick one out of the way. The next one should take you a while." 

 When we got to her front door she unlocked it, turned to me, giggled and said: 

 "Humor me. Pick me up and carry me over the threshold." I did as she asked and once in the door she said: 

 "Up the stairs and the first door on the right." 

 When I got her into the bedroom and set her down she said, "Race you" and started taking off her clothes. She beat me, but only because I told her to leave on her thigh highs and high heels. Once naked I moved toward her and she laughed and jumped on the bed and spread her legs wide for me. Just as she thought I was getting ready to stick my cock in her I slid down and buried my tongue in her pussy. 

 "Ooh" she moaned. "You shouldn't do that. No one has ever done that to me before." 

 I laughed and said, "As my girlfriend you will have to get used to it" and I kept on going. Soon after she was grinding her pussy into my face and her hands were pulling me head to her as she had an orgasm. Before she came down from it I moved up and slid my cock into her hot and very wet pussy. She wrapped her legs around me and I fucked her nice and slow. She climaxed twice more before I reached the point where I got mine and after I blew my wad I held myself in her until I was soft. When I pulled out she turned and changed position and took me in her mouth. I'd cum twice in the last hour so it took her a bit to get me standing tall and once up I moved her into position to do her doggie. 

 "You going to do my ass" she asked. 

 "Maybe next time. Right now I want that steaming hot pussy of yours." 

 I put the head of my cock at her entrance and she shoved back as I pushed and I slid all the way in with just one stroke. I fucked her hard and she came twice before I got to mine and when I shot off I was done for the night. She tried to get me up again and given and hour or two she might have been able to do it, but she wasn't into giving a two hour blow job even though she did want to go again. I was reaching for my pants and she asked what I was doing. 

 "Getting dressed to go home." 

 "Oh no you aren't. You are going to wake up next to me in the morning and hopefully you will be rested enough that we can play some more." 

 "I don't think that is a good idea. What if your husband comes home early and catches us?" 

 "He won't come home early and catch s because he already knows that you are here and what we are doing." 

 "He what!" 

 "He already knows. I told him not to come home without calling because I was going to try and get you to come home with me and that if I managed it I was going to try and fuck you to death." 

 "You are serious?" 

 "Absolutely. Ken has 'acute erectile dysfunction' and he hasn't been able to get it up for over two years now. He doesn't want to lose me so he gave me permission to take on a lover. I chose you, but it has taken a while for me to make it happen. I told you I wanted to be your girlfriend and I didn't mean for just tonight." 

 I sat on the edge of the bed and looked at her. It felt odd to know that her husband knew I was in his bedroom making love to his wife. I'm not a very jealous guy, but I couldn't image letting a young guy fuck my wife even if I couldn't do it myself. 

 In the morning I was indeed rested enough to play some more and then Jan fixed us breakfast. While we were eating the phone rang and she answered it. She put her hand over the mouthpiece and said: 

 "It's Ken." 

 Back on the phone she said, "I don't know. Let me ask." She covered the mouthpiece again and asked, "Can you get it up again in the next ten minutes or so?" I shook my head no. 

 "Yes; you can come home now." 

 "Of course I did. He is sitting on the other side of the table. You want to talk to him?" 

 "No matter. You need to know that I'm his steady girlfriend now so I'll be seeing him often." 

 "Don't be that way Ken. We agreed that if I was going to stay with you I was going to have a sex life." 

 "Whatever." 

 "Yes I do love you and you know I do. My being his girlfriend is not going to change that." 

 "Fine. I'll see you when you get home." 

 "I love you too. Bye." 

 She hung up and said, "I'd love to do it one more time, but I don't think we could do it and get you out of here before he gets here. He knows, but I don't want to rub his nose in it." 

 "I understand" I said. "You have my cell number and of course you can call me at work. Okay?" 

 "Okay." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the next six months we got together two or three times a week. Several times she came to my office and let me fuck her on my desk while people milled around in the outer office. 

 We would meet in the parking lot and she would give me blow jobs and every once in a while she would drag me into the back seat for some risky loving. At least once someone walking by stopped to watch and when Jan noticed she blew him a kiss. 

 I decided to stop collecting rent receipts and start building equity so I bought a three bedroom ranch style and Jan decided that we needed to make love in every room. The master bedroom was on Monday followed by what was going to be the guest room on Tuesday and then on Wednesday the bedroom that I was going to turn into a home office was christened. 

 Thursday it was the dinning rom. Being a guy and not paying attention to some of the things a woman would have gotten to right away I had not yet put up curtains or blinds. For some reason or other Ken decided to follow Jan on that Thursday. He stood outside and watched through the window as we made love three times. He watched me eat her pussy and then fuck her. He saw her suck my cock and then fuck me cowgirl. He watched as we went sixty-nine and then as I took her doggie. Jan called me later that evening and told me that he had watched and that it had upset him greatly and then she said we couldn't see each other any more. 

 Two weeks later my doorbell rang and when I opened the door I saw Jan standing there. 

 "If you don't have someone in your bedroom right now I think you should take me there." 

 After a frenzied fuck she told me that she had told him if he wanted her to stay married tom he was going to have to accept that she was going to fuck me whenever the mood struck her. He finally bowed to her wishes. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next seven months flew by and Jan and I were averaging three times a week. Back seats in parking lots, on desks at work, at my place and at least a dozen times at her place and a few of those times he was at home, but went into another part of the house when I got there. 

 I'm probably a prime asshole for saying it, but fucking Jan while he was in the house and hearing her scream out in passion was one hell of a turn on and I told Jan that. She laughed and then said we should do it more often and we did. I never knew which part of the house he was in when it happened, but I fucked her on their bed, the kitchen table, the living room couch and floor, the washing machine and dryer and on the hood of his car out in their garage. 

 Ken finally called me up and asked me not to see her any more. I asked him how she felt about it and he said that he hadn't talked to her yet, but he didn't want to lose her and he felt that she was getting too attached to me and he decided that they needed to work some on their marriage. I don't know what happened when he talked to her, but she fucked me nine times over the next three days and then she stopped calling me. 

 I might be an asshole, but I'm not a flaming asshole and as much as I liked spending time with Jan and as bad as I wanted to keep making love to her (and it had reached the point where it was making love and not just fucking) I decided not to call her. I didn't want to wreck her marriage and destroy her family. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two years went by and I had gone through a couple of relationships that didn't take. To be honest, that they didn't catch fire and go was all on me. I never could get Jan out of my mind. And then one day at work Jan called me and asked me to meet her at the Landing Strip that evening. It just happened that it was a Wednesday and that was open mike night at the Strip. So there I was at eight drinking a vodka tonic with a slice of lime and listening to amateur comics as I waited for her. 

 Sarah was a housewife by day, but she was pretty funny. The jokes were kind of stale, but she had a great delivery. Her best one was:  

 

 ****** Bob and Jan ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "The woman went to the doctor and after the examination he sighed and said "I've got some very bad news for you. You have cancer and you had best put your affairs in order." 

 The woman was shocked and asked how long she had and the doctor told her maybe six to eight months. The woman composed herself and went out to the waiting room where he daughter was waiting for her. 

 "Well daughter, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things aren't so good. In this case things are not well at all. I have cancer and not much time to live so let's go have a martini or two." 

 After 3 or 4 martinis the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and a few more martinis. They were eventually approached by some of the woman's old friends who were curios as to what the two were celebrating. The woman told her friends that they were drinking to her impending end. 

 "I've been diagnosed with AIDS." 

 The friends were aghast, gave their condolences and beat a hasty retreat. After the friends left the woman's daughter said: 

 "Momma? I thought you said you were dying of cancer. Why did you tell them that you were dying of AIDS?" 

 "Because I don't want them sleeping with your father after I'm gone." 

 And that, my friends, is what is called "Putting your affairs in order." 

 She got a roar of applause and Bobby Dalton stepped up to the mike, told the expected blond joke. Just as he was introducing the next hopeful I saw Jan coming through the door. She saw me, smiled and headed toward me as I wondered what was going to happen next. Report_Story
