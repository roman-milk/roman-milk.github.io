Bob Gwen and Harlina
====================
#1 

 

 

===

I met Gwen on my first day at work. She was the receptionist and the person who issued me my temporary ID badge and told me where to report in. To say that I was taken by the raven haired beauty with the deep blue eyes would be a massive understatement. Going gaa gaa over her would be closer to the truth. I did notice that there were no rings on her finger. As I walked away from her desk I'd already made up my mind that I was going to try and get something going with her. 

 Easier said than done. A beauty like Gwen had to be hit on all the time. She could take her pick from hundreds of guys. I would be one out of a herd of hundreds and I didn't have anything special going for me. I didn't think I was bad looking and I was in pretty good physical shape. Sports in high school and college had gotten me in damned good shape and after seeing the pudgy (and downright fat) ex-football players among the alumni who attended games I made a promise to myself that I would never be like that. I joined a gym when I graduated and I worked out regularly. But I was still only one of many and after being turned down seven times when I tried to get Gwen to date me I wrote her off as a lost cause. 

 Ironically it was writing Gwen off that got us together. Gwen was used to guys hitting on her and even though she shot a good many of them down she was used to them keeping on trying. I guess I didn't get the memo. I didn't stay with the program. I tried, got nowhere and walked away. Apparently you were not supposed to do that to Gwen. 

 Maybe two months after my seventh attempt at getting a date, getting nowhere and walking away I noticed that Gwen was being a little nicer toward me, smiling more at me and even engaging in short conversations. I didn't realize that they were a signals being sent to me to get me back to being in her orbit like all the others. Not recognizing them for what they were (or perhaps sub- consciously knowing, but not being interested in being part of the crowd) I ignored them. Since I was ignoring or oblivious to her signals Gwen stepped up her game. 

 She started joining me in the breakroom when I took my ten o'clock and two o'clock breaks. Since she was very easy on the eyes (I have mentioned that she was a beauty right?) I welcomed her company and did nothing to chase her away when she started joining me for lunch in the company cafeteria. I didn't mind at all having a gorgeous woman to look at while eating lunch or on a break and I never bothered to ask her why the sudden interest. Nor did I ever make another move toward asking her out even though she gave me some small hints that she might be open to an invitation. 

 Things bumped along for about a month and then one Wednesday, during our two o'clock break she did something that I never expected. Gwen asked me for a date. Well maybe not a ‘real' date. What she needed was an escort to a family function. The story, as I got it from her, was there would be a few people there that she wanted to avoid, but if she showed up alone she wouldn't be able to. If she was on the arm of someone they would stay away from her. 

 It sounded a bit fishy to me at first, but then I thought maybe not. Maybe an old boyfriend or two were going to be there and she wanted nothing to do with them. Either way I wasn't going to say no to her. It might not be a real date, but I would be spending time with the most gorgeous woman I had ever met. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The family function was an engagement party for an older brother and his intended so there were both family and friends there. I was introduced around by Gwen and she stayed right by my side for almost the whole time we were there. I figured that I was right when I surmised that an old boyfriend or two would be there that she wanted to avoid because I saw at least three who looked at me like they wanted to see me come to harm. Most likely they were friends of her brother that she had dated. 

 That thought was reinforced some when I saw one of the three approach her brother for a short talk and minutes later the brother came over and asked me if he could borrow Gwen for a few minutes. Gwen had also seen the guy talking to her brother and she said: 

 "You don't really want me to ruin your party do you? If that asshole gets anywhere near me I'll create a scene that you will remember to your dying day." 

 Tony (her brother) gave her a long look and then turned and walked away. 

 We mingled and Gwen was never more than two feet away from me. I met the bride to be and was instantly smitten. If she wasn't already taken I might have taken a shot at her myself. She was the total opposite of Gwen. Gwen was tall, sultry and sexy while Alice was maybe five one or five two and had the fresh faced look of the girl next door. I think Gwen noticed the attraction and to get me away from Alice she tugged on my sleeve and said she had someone she wanted me to meet. 

 She walked me over to a large older man, maybe early to mid-fifties, with a large white walrus type mustache. As we walked up to him he said: 

 "Whatcha got Princess? Another fly caught in your web?" 

 "Just a good friend Uncle Dan." 

 She introduced us and he smiled and said, "Watch out lad. She can be pretty overpowering when she really turns it on." 

 "Then I guess I'm already in trouble. Especially if she hasn't turned it on yet. I'm not sure that I can handle what she is now. I can't even begin to imagine her really turning it on." 

 He laughed and said, "Then I would suggest you start running now lad. Get some distance from her." 

 "I should have known better than to introduce you to him. I lose more boyfriends that way." 

 Boyfriend? I was now a boyfriend? 

 We talked for a few minutes and then my body signaled that it was time for me to find a bathroom. Uncle Dan told me where it was and for the first time since we got there Gwen and I were separated. I figured that she would be all right being with her uncle until I could get back to them. 

 I used the bathroom and when I came out there was a guy standing there to use it next. As I went by him he said: 

 "You're the guy here with Gwen right?" 

 I nodded a yes and he said, "Be careful dude. Don't trust her" and then he was in the bathroom and had closed the door. 

 Gwen wasn't with her Uncle Dan and so I went looking for her. I ran into Alice and asked her if she'd seen Gwen and she told me that she had last seen Gwen talking to Gary by the door to the garage. Then she said: 

 "Gwen is a great girl Bob, but she needs a strong hand. Keep that in mind if you end up as a couple." 

 I was going to ask her for an explanation, but another guest came up to us to ask her something so I resumed my search for Gwen. I headed for the door in the kitchen that led into the attached garage. I didn't find Gwen there, but I did hear a voice in the garage that sounded like Gwen's. I opened the door and saw Gwen and a guy that I assumed was Gary. He was the guy that I had earlier seen talking to Tony before Tony came over and asked if he could borrow Gwen for a bit. He had her backed up against the fender of a car and he had his hands on her arms and was holding her there and I said: 

 "What's going on here?" 

 "None of your business. Get out of here and leave us alone" the guy said. 

 "It is my business" I fired back. "She is my date and that makes it my business. Now get your hands off of her and get away from her." 

 "Fuck you!" he said which was the wrong thing to say to me. I headed for him and he turned and got into some kind of martial stance and launched a kick at me. Those things might work if you are faster than a speeding bullet which is something he wasn't. I turned and took the kick on my left side, clamped his leg against my body with my left arm and then stepped backwards. That pulled him off his planted foot. His arms flailed as he tried to catch his balance and I gave him a solid right to the face. Blood squirted from his nose and I let go of the clamped leg and gave him a push that sent him to the floor. I was a firm believer in the old saying "Once you have them down keep them down" so when he hit the floor I kicked him as hard as I could in the crotch. He doubled up on the floor and I grabbed Gwen and said: 

 "Come on; let's get out of here." 

 We left the garage and Gwen said, "Thank you. If you hadn't shown up when you did I would have started screaming and that would have put a damper on the party." 

 "Who was that jerk?" 

 "An old boyfriend who didn't like being dumped. I dumped him because he was a jerk. Or maybe he was always a jerk and I just didn't notice it at first. We had better leave. When Gary gets back on his feet he might come looking for us. I don't want a scene that will ruin Alice's party" 

 We found Alice and Tony out on the patio, said our goodbyes and then left. 

 It was still fairly early and I asked Gwen if there was something she wanted to do with the rest of the day. She told me that she was open to suggestions so I asked her if she liked country/western music and she said she did so I took her to dinner at Santiago's and then to Buckskins to listen to the music and maybe dance. 

 The band that night was Without a Net and they were a pretty decent group. Gwen knew most of the dances and we had a pretty good time. I had to use the men's room and while I was gone the band started a number that was good for the Cowboy Cha Cha. The Cowboy Cha Cha is a dance you can do as a couple or you can do it solo. 

 When I got back to our table I spotted Gwen out on the floor doing the dance solo. I couldn't take my eyes off of her as she dipped, swayed and turned. Her lovely dark mane swirling as she moved to the music. I had never in my life wanted anything more that I wanted her right then. Yes, I wanted her, but deep down inside me I knew that I could never have her the way I wanted. I knew, absolutely knew, that I would never be enough for Gwen. She was just too much woman for any one man. 

 The tune ended and as she came back to our table I noticed that all the male eyes in the place were on her as she made her way back to me. Yes I wanted her, but I knew I couldn't hold her. I didn't believe that any man could, but that didn't kill the want. 

 We closed the place and I drove her home. On the ride she told me that it had been a while since she'd had so much fun and she thanked me for the evening. When I got her to her place she kissed me and thanked me again for the evening. As I drove home I wondered why the Gods fucked with people the way they did. They knew that a girl like Gwen wouldn't be able to settle for one man, but they kept putting her in front of men who couldn't resist her. Men just like me. 

 I also thought about Uncle Dan, Alice and the man who met me coming out of the bathroom at the engagement party. They all told me to be careful, very careful with Gwen. I went to bed that night determined to heed their warnings. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday morning when I walked into work Gwen greeted me with a smile and a cheerful "Good morning." I returned both and headed for my office. Gwen joined me for the ten o'clock and two o'clock breaks, but the conversations we had were general in nature. 

 She joined me for lunch and both breaks on Tuesday and Wednesday, but I never did what she was expecting. I never asked her for a date. I wanted to; God knows I wanted to, but I knew that Gwen would be bad for me so I didn't make a move. 

 Thursday I didn't get a smile from Gwen when I got to work and she didn't join me for either break or lunch. Friday I nor only didn't get a smile I was barely acknowledged. She looked up from what she was doing when I walked in, saw that it was me and then looked back down at what she was doing. Needless to say she didn't join me for lunch or either of the breaks. 

 Monday I got to the office before she did so I was spared the ‘cool' reception. The morning break at ten found me sitting at a table in the breakroom when Gwen came into the room. She saw me, hesitated for a second or three, started my way and then abruptly changed direction and went to an empty table on the other side of the room. She was sitting of to the side of me so I wasn't looking her way, but I could feel her eyes on me the entire time I was there. 

 I was out of the office when lunch time and the afternoon break came around, but the next day when I got to work Gwen gave me a small smile and said good morning. I returned the greeting and then went to my office and got busy with the stuff in my in basket. I worked through the morning break and at noon I decided to have my lunch at the diner down the street. 

 The waitress had just brought me my order when I saw Gwen come in. She looked around the crowded place and saw that the only empty seats in the place were at my table. She came over and asked if she could join me and I of course said yes. The waitress came over and took Gwen's order and then, not wanting to seem rude, I held off on eating until her order arrived. While waiting we talked, mostly about work and some of the people there, but just as the waitress approached with Gwen's food Gwen asked me: 

 "Why don't you like me?" 

 That took me completely by surprise. 

 "Why in the world would you think that I don't like you?" 

 "You don't ask me out." 

 "That's not so Gwen. I've asked you out over a half dozen times and you turned me down each time. Since you obviously were not interested I quit asking." 

 "The day you took me to the engagement party when you took me home I told you it had been a long time since I'd had so much fun and I kissed you when you walked me to my door. That was ‘girl speak' for call me. Girl speak for I want to do it again, but since then you haven't done a thing." 

 "My bad, but in my defense I don't speak any foreign languages." 

 "Foreign languages?" 

 "I don't speak or understand girl speak." 

 "Then I guess I'm going to have to tutor you. Do you have anything going tonight?" 

 "Nothing that I can't get out of." 

 "If you would like you can have your first lesson tonight." 

 I looked at Gwen and wondered just what in the hell was going on. I was nothing special, but she was. Why was she coming on to me? I might not have been anything special, but I was no fool and no way in hell was I going to pass up a chance to be with Gwen. 

 "What time?" I asked. 

 "Will six work for you?" 

 "It will." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I arrived to pick her up I found her in jeans and a ‘brush popper' shirt and as soon as I saw the outfit she said: 

 "I'll bet you can guess what I want to do." 

 I felt ridiculous standing in front of her in a suit and tie, but it was correctable. I had a gym bag in the car that had a sweatshirt in it that I could change into. I was going to look a tad grungy compared to Gwen, but it couldn't be helped. 

 We went back to Buckskins and had a great time. Buckskins offered free dance lessons on Wednesdays and Thursdays and that night's lesson was the West Coast Swing and neither of us knew it and we had a good time learning it. Lessons lasted from seven until nine and there was a ten minute break between sessions and during the breaks we sat at a table, sipped our drinks and talked. Mostly about finding more about each other. 

 I leaned that she had two brothers and one sister. She had a two year Associates Degree in Business Management and was only working as a receptionist while looking for something better. Her favorite color was red, she liked football (her favorite team was the Denver Broncos), baseball (Detroit Tigers) but didn't care for basketball, hockey or soccer at all. She liked classical music, bluegrass, Dixieland, jazz and Golden Oldies and couldn't stand rap, hip hop, heavy metal or acid rock. She preferred action movies to chic flics and her favorite recreational activity was to go out to the range with her Llama .380 hand gun. All in all she was my kind of girl. 

 When I walked her to her door she turned and kissed me and then said, "What did I just say to you? 

 "That you would like me to call?" 

 "You got an A on your first quiz. I'll have you understanding ‘girl speak' in no time." 

 As I drove back to my place my mind was at war with itself. Half of it wanted me to grab onto Gwen and hold on for dear life, but the other half was telling me to stay away from her and avoid getting hurt. I listened to the part telling me to grab onto. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Over the next two months Gwen and I dated to or three times a week and the goodnight kisses at her front door got longer and hotter and soon led to full- fledged make out sessions in the car before I walked her to her door. Nothing sexual occurred – I kept my hands to myself – even though my body ached for her, but I was too scared of doing anything that might push her away. 

 During that two month period Gwen found a better job and I no longer got to see her every day at breaks and lunches. I didn't much care for her new job because at times it required her to work late and she had to break dates with me. I finally reached the point where I wanted to take it to the next level and I started shopping for a ring, but before I found one that I liked things came unglued on me. 

 It was a Thursday and I had a date with Gwen that evening. That is I did until she called me at work and told me that she had to work late. I didn't feel like sitting home alone so I thought I would head over to Buckskins to see if their line dance lessons would include one I didn't know. I would have a drink or several while I was there and I don't like to drink on an empty stomach so I decided to stop somewhere and get a bite to eat. When I made that decision I was driving down Clairmont and I saw a sign saying "Angelos – Fine Italian Dinning" and I decided to give them a try. 

 The first thing I saw when I walked in the door was Gwen seated in a booth with a man I didn't know. Not across from him, but next to him. His left hand was on the table and she was holding it with her right. They were smiling at each other and I turned around and headed for my car, got in it and pulled out of the parking lot all thoughts of Buckskins gone. There I would have nursed drinks between lessons, but I was no longer in a ‘nursing drinks' kind of mood. I pointed the car toward Bud's Bar where I could get some serious drinking done. 

 As I drove I told myself that I knew all along that Gwen was not a girl that I could hold onto. When I got to Bud's I got a table in the back and settled in to drown my sorrows. As I drank I wondered if Gwen ever worked late and if all of our broken dates were because she was going out with another guy or guys. 

 I had more to drink than I should have, but I was still clear headed enough to give my car keys to Mike and have him call me a cab. "Okay" he said, "You're a cab" and then he laughed and picked up the phone. The cab dropped me at home and I hit the bed.  

 

 

===

In the morning my head hurt, but then I knew it would while I was pounding down the drinks at Bud's. A handful of aspirin followed by several cups of black coffee got me into enough shape to make it to work. Luckily it was a busy day for me and by concentrating on the work at hand I was able to push Gwen to the back of my mind until quitting time. However she was back in the forefront when I got off work that afternoon. 

 She came back full force when I had to call a cab to take me to Bud's to pick up my car. Making the call reminded me of just why my car was at Bud's. I got my keys from Mike, had one beer and then left. I couldn't afford to try and drink away my sorrows. Cab home last night, cab to work that morning, cab to Bud's to get my car plus what I spent on booze the night before had put a severe dent in my available funds. 

 Driving home from Bud's I thought about the situation and wondered why I had let it get to me. I'd known all along that Gwen and I were mismatched. I was lucky to get what little I had gotten from her. Deep inside I knew that it had to end sometime and now it had. Time to get on with life. I packed up all my camping gear and headed for Lake Martin. I spent the weekend working on my tan and communing with nature. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got home Sunday night the red light on my answering machine was blinking. The counter said I had nine messages. Eight were from Gwen and I deleted them as soon as I heard her voice. I had no need to hear what she had to say and the sooner I could put her behind me the better. One was from some guy wanting my support in his bid for a seat on the City Council. I deleted that one too. 

 The day went fast and when I got home the red light was blinking again. Four messages; three from Gwen and one a surprise. I wondered why Gwen was calling my home phone instead of my cell so I took a look at it and found that it was turned off. I'd forgotten that I'd turned it off when I went to the lake and had forgotten to turn it back on. On reflection it was probably a good thing otherwise it might have gone off constantly while I was trying to enjoy my weekend. I decided against turning it back on until the morning. 

 Back to the call that was a big surprise. Not much of a message, just "Call me" followed by a phone number. I recognized the voice and I suddenly had another decision to make. To return the call or not. Then I laughed at myself. Of course I would return the call. Curiosity practically demanded that I do it. 

 Harlina Collins had been my girlfriend from the day we met in the eighth grade until the middle of our senior year in college. It was a foregone conclusion to both our families that we would be married when we graduated and in truth both mothers were already planning the wedding. 

 And then everything went to shit! 

 It started simply enough and I'm sure that if you've been to college (and probably at some high schools for that matter) you have experienced it. The instructor splits the class up into groups and assigns each group a project. Lina (I called Harlina Lina) had to meet with her group at the library to research and plan their project. She had to break several dates with me in order to do it and I thought nothing of it because I'd been through the same thing in some of my classes. 

 I remembered the day vividly. It was a Wednesday and Lina and I had a date to attend an art exhibit at a local gallery. I really had no interest in art, but the artist was a friend of Lina's so we were going to stop in and show support. I got the call just as I was leaving my four o'clock class. Lina told me she had to break our date because the group had to meet to iron out some problems with their project. Since I was only going to the gallery to placate Lina I decided to skip it since Lina wouldn't be going. 

 I was sitting in the Student Union drinking a Coke and going over some class notes when my friend Arty sat down at my table. There was no "How you doing bud" or "How they hanging homes." He just said: 

 "You've been my friend for years home; have you ever known me to lie to you?" 

 "Never to my knowledge." 

 "I hate this home, but I got to tell you. Harlina is stepping out on you. I've seen her three times with some big dude." 

 "I know about it. She is in a study group working on an assigned project." 

 "Two is not a group homes; two is a couple and the couple I was looking at were kissing and playing ‘touchy-feely' with each other." 

 "When was this?" 

 "Last Monday, Wednesday and Thursday." 

 I thought back and all three of those nights Lina was supposedly at the library with her group." 

 "Where did you see them?" 

 "All three times it was at Angie's." 

 Arty was attending school on scholarships and he earned his spending money washing dishes at Angie's Restaurant and bar. Angie's was on the other side of town and in an area that I was not likely to visit to randomly visit. In fact I had only been there twice in the last four years and the last time was two years ago. I started gathering up my books and said: 

 "Thanks for the heads up Arty." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Since the last three times you saw her were all on nights she was supposed to be with her group at the library and since she just called and cancelled on me again I have an overwhelming urge to drive over to Angie's." 

 "If they follow past practice they won't get there until around seven. The guy is a big dude and he looks like a scrapper. I'm on my way to work so if anything happens I'll be there to watch your back." 

 The drive over to Angie's took a half an hour and when I got there I parked where I could watch Angie's parking lot. It was a bit of a wait and around seven I saw a car pull in and I saw Lina and a guy get out of the car. He was indeed a big guy. Maybe six four and two twenty. I saw them kiss and then walk into the restaurant holding hands. The kiss and the hand holding told me all that I had to know and I was about to start the car and drive away, but at the last second I said "Fuck it!" and I got out of the car and headed for the building. 

 They were sitting in a booth and Lina had her back to me. I walked up to them and said, "Hey Harlina. Busy working on your project I see. Funny thing though; this doesn't look much like a library to me." 

 I always thought that "Her face turned pale" was a figure of speech until I saw Harlina's face as she looked up at me. 

 "Just out of curiosity Harlina, how long have you been a cheating slut?" 

 The guy said, "Hey asshole! You can't talk to her like that. Get the hell out of here before I get pissed and throw you out." 

 "Fuck you fuck face! I'll talk to my ex-fiancée any way I want." 

 The guy moved to get out of the booth and I grabbed the beer mug in front of him and tossed the beer in his face. His hands flew up to his face and with a firm grip on the handle of the beer mug I slammed it into the side of his head. It knocked him out and he slid down on his seat. I know it wasn't very sporting of me, but he was six four to my five eleven and two twenty to my one eighty- five and I would have terminally stupid to let him get out of the booth to where he could get to me. I turned to Lina and said: 

 "I'll leave it up to you to tell the mothers why the wedding they have been planning isn't going to happen. Don't bother calling me and spouting some ridiculous bullshit about how it isn't what it looks like and it doesn't mean anything. I don't want any contact with you anymore. I hope you have a sucky life Harlina." 

 I turned away from the tale, waved at Arty and then left the restaurant. 

 I saw her around the campus, but I avoided her and never spoke to her again. And now two years later a call from her. A simple "Call me" and curiosity was going to force me to do it. But first I was going to have a bite to eat and a large Jack with water back to fortify me. 

 It was eight when I finally felt that the Jack had me ready to hear Harlina's voice. I dialed the number and it rang four times before the phone was picked up and I heard: 

 "I wondered if you would call." 

 Ain't caller ID wonderful? 

 "Why? You had to know that curiosity would make me call." 

 "Can we meet somewhere for a drink?" 

 "Not tonight. I've already had more Jack than I should have." 

 "You pick the time and place." 

 For several seconds I debated on just hanging up and losing the number. A phone conversation was one thing, but an in person face to face was something else again. But then there was that curiosity thing. 

 "Bud's Bar at six tomorrow work for you?" 

 "It will. And Bob? Thank you." 

 I hung up the phone and then wondered if I'd done the right thing. Harlina was gone and buried in the past. Shouldn't I have left her there? 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I got to Bud's at a quarter to six figuring to have at least one drink to fortify myself for the coming meeting, but when I walked in I saw that Harlina was already there. She looked good, but then she always had. She was the polar opposite of Gwen. Where Gwen was sultry and sexy in a smoldering way Lina, as was Alice, the fresh faced girl next door. 

 As I neared the booth she stood up to greet me. She offered me her hand as she said, "Thank you for seeing me" and I took it for a brief shake. I sat down and as soon as my butt hit the seat Tina showed up and set a drink down in front of me and I glanced over at the bar and saw Mike watching me. He gave me a ‘thumbs up' and I acknowledged the gesture with a nod and a smile. I picked up the drink, took a sip and then asked: 

 "So what's up Harlina?" 

 "I'm hoping to find something that I lost." 

 "And what might that be?" 

 "You. These last two years have sucked for me Bob and all because you weren't there. I've missed you something fierce. I know that it was all my fault, but there is a hole in my life where you used to be and I want you back to fill that hole." 

 I sat there silently while taking an occasional sip of my drink. She apparently couldn't stand the silence so she kept talking. 

 "I know I hurt you Bob and I'm sorry that I did. I never meant to hurt you, but in all honesty I never thought that you would find out. I just had a need to get something out of my system before we graduated and settled down into a life together. Maybe I should have been upfront about it, but I was afraid that you would take it wrong. No. That isn't true. I knew how you would take it and I was afraid that I would lose you." 

 I still stayed silent and nursed my drink. I guess she expected me to say something or ask questions and my silence unnerved her. She looked away from me, took a drink from her glass and then said: 

 "We were fourteen when we started going together Bob and from the eighth grade until our senior year in college I'd never dated another boy. I had no idea of what other boys were like and I was curious. I tried to satisfy that curiosity and do it in a way that you would never know about it. And before you even ask it wasn't about sex although I did engage in some rather heavy necking sessions. 

 "It was just about finding out what other guys were like. Their likes and dislikes, how they interacted with girls and other guys. Stuff like that. I wasn't looking for a replacement for you, but I was curious. I was happy with you, but I was curious. I never found one that could even come close to taking your place. Over the last two years I've dated maybe two dozen guys, but not one of them was able to fill the void you left when you dumped me. I haven't even come close to being able to put you behind me. I don't know if you know it, but I call your mom every couple of weeks just to ask how you are." 

 I didn't know that. In the weeks following my breakup with Harlina my mother kept after me to sit down and talk with Harlina. 

 "You belong together Bobby and everyone knows it." 

 I finally told her that if she ever mentioned Harlina to me again I would stop coming home to visit. She must have realized I was serious because she never brought Harlina up again. As I sat across from Lina and listened to her I tried to separate the truth from the lies. 

 The fact that she was sitting across from me telling me her story was proof enough, for me at least, of the depth of her feelings for me, but there was no doubt in my mind that she was also lying to me. I believed it, but had no proof she was, only my memory of our times together. Lina had taken to sex like a baby duckling takes to water. After our very first time she wanted to do it damned near every time we found ourselves alone together. Four, five and sometimes six days a week and always – ALWAYS – more than once. 

 Her brother had some porn tapes and she would sneak into his room, get a couple and we would watch them and then she would want to reenact what we had just watched. Oral, anal and positions you needed to be made out of rubber to get into. She even wanted to try mild S&M and I almost always went along with her. I did draw the line when it came to water sports. She was pissed at me because I absolutely refused to do it, but even as pissed at me as she was she never stopped wanting to make love. 

 That was the Lina that I knew and there was no way she was going to sell me the story that all she ever did with guys was some heavy necking. It wasn't lost on me either that Lina's sneaking around on me started shortly after she saw how hung the actors were in the porn that we watched. 

 Still, that was then and this was now and here she was trying to get back to me. The question was "Could I let it happen?" Lord knows that I'd missed her and that hardly a week went by that I didn't think of her once or twice. I sat there looking at her and wondering if we could put it back together. 

 I still hadn't said a word and I had no idea of how Lina was taking my silence. She gave a deep sigh and then said: 

 "I don't have curiosity anymore and I want what we had back Bob. Think about it please. You have my number." 

 With a last long look at me she got up and left. And left me with questions that I doubted I'd get honest answers to even if I had asked them. But one of the things she'd said had registered; the "I don't have curiosity any more" and if that was true could I take a chance? I didn't know but I did know that I was going to be thinking about it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got home there were two messages on the recorder for me and both were from Gwen and both were the same. "Please call me as soon as you get this message Bob." I wondered why she hadn't called my cell. I took it out of its case and saw that it was turned off. I didn't remember turning it off. I tried to turn it it back on and saw that it had turned itself off because of a dead battery. I put the phone in the charger while I considered calling Gwen and getting it over with. WTF I thought; just do it and be done with it. I dialed her number and the call went to vice mail. Probably out with some guy and didn't want to be bothered was my thought and I also saw it as a sign that I shouldn't call her. I was thinking of Lina as I fell asleep. 

 In the morning I showered, shaved, grabbed my cell off the charger and headed off to work. I stopped and had breakfast at the Village Inn and when I got to work I was in a pretty good mood. That is I was in a pretty good mood until Lois (Gwen's replacement) handed me a stack of message slips and said: 

 "Please get her off my back Bob." 

 I looked through the slips and saw that two-thirds of them were from Gwen and most of them said "Call me as soon as you can." I picked up the office phone and called Gwen's cell. She answered on the third ring and said: 

 "I'm at work. I can't talk now. Call me tonight. Bye." 

 And she hung up. I looked at the phone in my hand and thought "So much for calling as soon as I could." I had a very busy day and when the day was over I picked up the phone and made a call. Not to Gwen, but to Harlina. I asked her if she would like to have dinner with me and she said yes. She gave me her address and as I was getting in to the car my cell phone chirped and the screen said the call was from Gwen so I let it go to voice mail. 

 I had a nice relaxed dinner with Harlina and the evening went well enough that I asked her if she would like to go out with me on Friday. She said yes and when I got her home she gave me one hell of a passionate kiss and tried to get me to come in for a drink. Remembering the Lina of old I was tempted, but said: 

 "It is too soon for that Lina. It is going to take me some time before I'm ready for that." 

 I didn't add that I wanted to be sure in my mind that she had indeed gotten her curiosities out of her system before I committed again. 

 I'd shut off my phone while I was on my date with Lina and as I walked back to the car after seeing Lina to her door I turned it back on again. There were two messages from Gwen. I looked at my watch and saw that it was just after eleven. Well she did say that she wanted me to call as soon as I could so I punched in her number and she sounded like she had just woken up when she answered.\ 

 "Bob? Do you have any idea what time it is?" 

 "You wanted me to call so I called. In fact it is my third call to you today. The first went to voice mail, you wouldn't take my second." 

 "Why didn't you call again only a little earlier?" 

 "Because I was on a date and it wouldn't have been cool to call you. To say nothing about the fact that it would have been bad manners to call you while I was with her." 

 "You were on a date? With a girl?" 

 "Yes Gwen; with a girl. I thought you knew I wasn't into guys." 

 "But a date with a girl? I thought we had something good going Bob." 

 "I thought so too Gwen; right up until I saw you holding hands with that guy at Angie's Restaurant on the night you broke a date with me because you had to work late. And before you even try I won't buy that it was just a quick bite to eat before rushing back to work. Angelo's is on the other side of town from the Fisher Building which is where you work. The Fisher has two restaurants in the building and there are a least six other eating establishments within a three block radius of the building so if you needed to duck out for a quick dinner break you didn't need to go across town to do it. Sorry for waking you up. Goodbye." 

 I broke the connection and the phone rang right away. I saw from the screen that it was Gwen, but I was no longer in the mood to talk so I turned the phone off. When I got home I saw the red light blinking on the answering machine. Without even checking the messages I unplugged the phone and answering machine and went to bed. 

 When I got to work in the morning I told Lois to tell Gwen, if she called, that she had been instructed not to take any messages from Gwen and if she persisted in calling Lois was to hang up on her. A coward's way out maybe, but so what?!  

 

 

===

I spent a quiet evening at home. Quiet because I had my cell turned off and I hadn't plugged the phone back in. I watched a bit of TV and then turned it off and picked up a book that I had been reading. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I received a smile and "She stopped calling" from Lois when I got to work. The day went quick and when I got off work I picked up Lina and we went out for dinner. After eating we went to The Pit for some drinks and dancing. 

 We were in a pretty mellow mood when I took Lina home and I did follow her inside when she asked me to come in for a nightcap. She set me down on the couch and went into the kitchen to make the drinks and I wasn't really all that surprised when she returned with a drink in each hand and without a stitch of clothing on. Just Lina naked except for her CFMs and two drinks. 

 I knew that I'd told Lina that it was too soon to go there, but try telling that to your cock when it was stiff as an iron bar from the sight in front of you. Lina smiled at my reaction, put the drinks on a side table and said: 

 "This way to the bedroom lover." 

 "Fuck it" I told myself. "You want this and you damned well know you do." 

 I got up from the couch and started shedding clothes as I followed her to the bedroom. Lina hadn't changed any since I last saw her naked. She was still the insatiable Lina that I had known and loved and it seemed that she had it in her mind to make up for lost time. 

 I ate her, she sucked me and then we fucked in the missionary position. After I got us both off she pushed me into a sixty-nine and when she had me ready she mounted me cowgirl and rode me. Cowgirl was followed by doggie after which I collapsed on the bed next to her. 

 It had been a while since I had even gotten off once, let alone three times and I was a bit tuckered. At least I was until she got up and went to her dresser and came back with a tube of KY. 

 "You know what I want lover, but you will have to work me up. It hasn't been visited since the last time you were there." 

 She maneuvered me into a sixty-nine with her on top and went to work on getting me up for the task while I worked on her rosebud with my fingers and the KY. By the time she had me up she was ready to move into the doggie position. I put the head of my cock against her rosebud. 

 "Easy lover. Slow and easy until I get used to it." 

 I took it slow and easy until she started pushing back at me and then I fucked her butt until she has a shuddering orgasm and then I pounded hard until I got mine. The fourth one did me in though and when I pulled out of her and fell to the bed beside her she snuggled up to me and I fell asleep. 

 I woke up in the morning to find Lina awake and leaning on an elbow and looking at me. 

 "I've really missed this; waking up next to you" she said. "Are you up for some wake up fun or would you like some breakfast first? 

 "Breakfast" I said. "I'm going to need to fuel this body if you plan on abusing it again." 

 "I'm hoping that I'll be able to abuse it for the rest of my life." 

 I still wasn't sure that the rest of her life was an option, but she damned sure abused it for the rest of the weekend. When I finally got back to my place Sunday night I was so worn out that I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The following two weeks were pretty much the alike. Work and Lina took up most of my time. I woke up in Lina's bed two or three times a week and she woke up in mine two or three times a week. 

 Gwen stopped calling, but she didn't quit trying to get to me. Twice she was waiting for me in the parking lot at work and both times I saw her first and went out through the loading dock, walked down the street to a bar and called a taxi to take me home. Once I saw her parked outside my apartment when I got home from work, but I hung a u-turn before she saw me and headed for a sports bar I sometimes went to. 

 Lina was pushing hard for us to move in together, but I was just a little bit reluctant to take that big a step just yet and there were a couple of reasons for that. One was that I couldn't convince myself that Lina's curiosity check list had all the boxes checked off. 

 Then there was Gwen. One thing I have always been is honest with myself. I still had feelings for her and I just could not go into a permanent relationship with Lina (or anyone else) while I was still carrying those feeling I had for Gwen. That sounds silly and I knew it. I'd always felt that Gwen was way out of my league and that a fulltime relationship with her couldn't last. I'd always thought that she was too much woman for me (or possibly I wasn't man enough for her) but despite those feeling I still spent an awful lot of my time thinking about her. Even given the reason I'd pulled away from her she still had a hold on me. 

 Apparently Gwen finally decided that getting to me was not going to happen. After several weeks went by and I didn't see her around the hold that she had on me faded. As Gwen faded the bond between me and Lina strengthened and I finally agreed to let her move in with me. 

 The next three months went by with Lina trying to fuck me to death and pushing me to take the final step and put a ring on her finger. I was wavering. Right up until the night I found her with another cock in her lousy cunt. 

 It was a Tuesday and I left the apartment for the airport to catch a flight to Chicago where I was to take part in a three day meeting over how to handle my company's takeover of one of our largest competitors. I was sitting in the boarding area when my cell phone beeped. It was my boss telling me that the meetings had to be postponed a week because of the death of the owner of the company we were taking over. I called Lina to let her know of the change in plans, but she was apparently in a meeting or something and the call went to voice mail. No matter. She would get the message some time during the day. I went on in to work and put in a full day before heading home. 

 When I got home I saw Lina's car in the parking lot and I smiled expecting that she would have dinner ready when I walked in the door. There was nothing hot on the stove, but from the sounds coming from the bedroom something hot was going on in there. I walked up to the door and looked in. Lina was on her hands and knees and was being fucked dog fashion. I couldn't tell from where I was standing which hole the guy was filling, but then I guess that it didn't really matter. Apparently she hadn't checked her phone for messages during the day. 

 I had seen Lina's purse sitting on the kitchen table and I went to it and looked inside. Her phone was there and I checked and saw that my message was on it. I walked back to the bedroom door, selected speaker and pushed the necessary buttons on her phone and Lina and the guy buried in her heard: 

 "Hello sugar dumpling. My meeting has been cancelled and I'll be home at my regular time tonight. Love you. Bye." 

 Both Lina and the guy turned to look at the bedroom doorway and saw me standing there. They weren't the only ones surprised. Imagine my surprise when I saw that the guy fucking Lina was the same guy she had been with when I broke up with her way back when. I just shook my head in disgust and said: 

 "I'm going to leave for a while Harlina. Maybe two or three hours and when I come back I want you and all of your things to be gone. And it should go without saying that I never want to see or speak to your sorry ass ever again." 

 I turned and left the apartment. I came back three hours later and Harlina and all of her things were gone. 

 It took me a bit to get over Lina, but not all that long when you stop and consider that I'd always had a doubt or two where she was concerned. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I received a promotion at work and it involved a lot of travel. The next two months found me rarely at home as I settled into my new job. I finally got things worked out so that I was always home by Thursday night. 

 My first weekend I decided to go out for dinner and drinks. It was a Friday and after dinner at Tricocci's I decided to go to Buckskins for a drink or two and to listen to some country/western music. The band that night was the Dawson James Band. They were pretty good even if somewhat predictable. If you heard them once then you knew exactly what songs would be played and in what order. It never changed. Even the supposed adlibs were the same. Not once in the dozen or so times I'd heard them had they changed. Even so it was good music to dance to. 

 There were several unescorted ladies there that night, but I didn't feel like ‘playing the game' that night so I stuck to the line dances. I'd been there about an hour and had just finished a Cowboy Cha Cha and was on my bar stool nursing a PBR while watching the ass of the barmaid as she moved around serving customers when a familiar voice said: 

 "Howdy stranger." 

 I turned and saw Gwen standing there. She was as breathtakingly beautiful as ever. As I took in the sight she said: 

 "I just got here with a couple of friends and saw you sitting here. Would you like to join us?" 

 "I wouldn't want to intrude on your evening." 

 "You wouldn't be intruding. The three of us could use a decent dance partner. I do seem to remember that you can hold your own out there." 

 When she first said that she was with friends I had assumed that she was with a guy and no way I wanted to see her with another man. Stupid of me and I knew it. I couldn't have her, but I couldn't bear seeing her with someone else. "The three of us could use a decent dance partner" changed all of that. Three women I could handle. Dance wise I mean. 

 I followed her over to a table where she introduced me to Sarah and Stacy. I had a great time getting to know the girls and taking turns dancing with them. I called it quits at midnight although Stacy did ask me to stay a little longer. I fibbed a little and told her I would normally stay until closing, but that I had something to do early in the morning and I needed to get home and get some rest. 

 I really didn't have anything to do early. The truth of the matter was that being around Gwen was getting to me. Most of the dances I'd done with her were of the type that didn't allow much in the way of conversation. Can't talk much doing eastern swing and the Texas twostep. I'd done all of the slow dances with Sarah and Stacy, but the drinks I'd consumed both before and after joining the three were putting me in the mood (or giving me the courage) to ask Gwen out. The problem with that was that I remembered why I had stopped seeing her and deep down inside me a voice was crying out: 

 "Don't get us hurt again!" 

 I decided that I'd better get out of the bar before I did just that. As I was getting ready to go Sarah said: 

 "We are usually here on Friday and while I can't speak for the others I liked dancing with you and I'd like to do it again." 

 "I second that motion" Stacy said and it was not lost on me that Gwen said nothing. 

 I smiled and said, "I've enjoyed my night with you ladies and I really would like to do it again so maybe you will see me back here." 

 And I meant most of it. I had enjoyed spending time with them and I really have liked to do it again, but it wasn't likely that I would. Not if Gwen was going to be there. Talk about conundrums. I wanted to be with her; I wanted her to be around, but I knew if I let it happen I would get hurt again. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I spent the weekend alone and not doing much and during the week work pretty much kept my mind occupied. But the closer I got to Friday the more I thought about going to Buckskins. I remembered that Sarah had said that they were usually there on Friday. To me that meant they might not be there on the coming Friday or that maybe only one or two of them might be there and maybe, just maybe, that the one or two wouldn't be Gwen. 

 When I flew home from Atlanta on Thursday I'd already made up my mind to go to Buckskins on Friday and if Gwen was there so what! I'd proved the previous Friday that I had enough sense to get out before letting anything stupid happen. Like letting Gwen get her hooks in me again. Just watch your alcohol intake bubba and get the hell out of Dodge if you start thinking of making a move on Gwen is what I told myself. 

 I showed up at Buckskins at seven and saw that the band for the night was Carlos Washington. It was one of my favorite local groups so I expected that I would have a good night. As soon as I was in the door I saw Sarah sitting alone at a table. She saw me at the same time and waved me over to join her. As I sat down she said: 

 "Thank God that you are here. Now maybe the assholes will stop coming over here and bothering me." 

 "I thought that was the purpose of you being here." 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "You come here to enjoy the music and dance and since you are alone the guys are going to come up to you and ask you to dance." 

 "There is that, but a lot of the guys here right now are regulars and are only interested in finding a female for some parking lot fun and so far those creeps are the only ones who have been coming over." 

 "Well you are safe with me. I don't do parking lots. I need a bed." 

 Her face got a sour look when I said that so I quickly said, "I was making a funny there sweets. You don't have to worry about me." 

 Her face lightened and then the waitress came up and took my order. I ordered one for Sarah also. The band hadn't set up yet and the music was from the bars sound system and a couple of couples were out on the floor dancing so I asked Sarah if she would like to dance. She said yes and so we moved out onto the floor. 

 It was a waltz and as I held her in my arms I wondered if she might say yes to a date and I made up my mind to ask her before the night was over. We stayed on the floor for two numbers and as I was walking her back to our table I noticed three other ladies that I had danced with on previous trips to Buckskins. Two of them had been ‘friends with benefits' at one time or another and one had almost attained that status. Thankfully it had been their choice to end things which made it easier for me to be around them when I came in to drink, dance or just listen to the music and on some nights they even danced with me. 

 I had just ordered another round for Sarah and myself when she suddenly said, "Oh goodie. They made it." 

 I turned to see Gwen and Stacy headed for us. Oh well, I knew it could happen and all it meant to me was that I would have a few less drinks and leave earlier that I had planned to. It also meant that I wouldn't be able to ask Sarah for a date. At least not on that night. 

 The band set up and for the next hour I took turns dancing with all three and, as on the previous Friday, all of my dances with Gwen were of the type where conversations wouldn't occur. Sarah and Stacy got up to use the bathroom and that left me sitting alone with Gwen. The band was on a break so the noise level was down. 

 I sat there glancing around the room looking at anything that would let me keep my eyes off Gwen when she said: 

 "What's the matter Bob? Cat got your tongue?" 

 "Not really. I just don't know what to say." 

 "You could say that you've missed me. Or would that be a lie?" 

 "No Gwen; it would not be a lie." 

 "Why haven't I heard from you then?" 

 "I saw no point in it." 

 "Why not Bob? I thought we had something going for us. How did it just go away?" 

 "You know why Gwen. I told you why the last time I talked with you." 

 "Yes; I remember that late night call, but what I don't understand is why you refused to let me explain. You wouldn't take my calls and you always seemed able to avoid me when I was looking for you. I remember saying to you that I thought we had something good going and I remember you replying that you thought so too. If you thought that weren't you at least a little curious as to why I was where I was and why I was with him there? Didn't you at least want to know?" 

 "No Gwen; I did not want to know. You apparently have no idea of how fragile the male ego is. The last thing I wanted to hear is that you were another guy because of some fault I had. Because I didn't measure up as far as you were concerned. The fact is that I never thought that I measured up, but the last thing I wanted was to hear it from you. So I took the cowards way out and didn't let you tell me." 

 "You are that insecure?" 

 I was quiet for several seconds and then said as I looked down at the table and said, "Yes; I guess that I am. I've only really cared for two women in my life and both of them did a number on me. Both took up with other guys and hid it from me. Both of them left me with doubts about myself. What was it that I didn't have that made them seek others? Both of them. Not one, but both so yes Gwen; I am that insecure." 

 "I am assuming that one of the two is me?" 

 I nodded a yes and she said, "I don't know about the other one, but I didn't do to you what you are assuming I did. If you would have just let me talk to you I could have cleared things up. I was not out with another guy because I thought you were lacking in some way. In fact I wasn't with another guy at least in that sense of the word. 

 "The man you saw me with was my brother Dave. He had flown in from Dallas to see a client. I was supposed to work late that night, but he called me at work when he finished his business and asked me to have dinner with him at Angelo's. Angelo's was closer to the airport than the Fisher Building and he was afraid that he might miss his flight home if he came all the way across town and then got hung up in traffic on his way back to the airport. 

 "I met him, we had dinner together and then I went back to work and he headed for the airport to catch his flight back to Dallas." 

 I was thinking about what she had just said and was wondering what I should say when Sarah and Stacy got back from the bathroom. I wasn't going to talk about personal stuff in front of the two of them so I didn't say anything to Gwen about what she had just told me. 

 And then the evening got strange. 

 The band came back from their break just as the two girls sat down and Carlos said, "I see that my old friend Bob Talbott is here tonight and our next number is his favorite. We haven't done it in a while, but since he is here we are going to pull it out, dust it off and give it a go. 

 I knew what he was going to play and it was a great song for an eastern swing. I was trying to decide which one of the three to ask for the dance. When the opening strains of "Ride Cowboy Ride" started a hand fell on my shoulder and a voice said: 

 "Off your butt Bobby; this is OUR song" and I turned and saw Melanie Murphey standing there. Mel was one of my ex-friends with benefits and Ride Cowboy Ride was indeed our song. It was the song that got us together way back when. If any of the three at the table had been with me as a date I would have said, "No thanks Mel" but I was not attached to anyone at the table so I got up and Mel and I hit the dance floor.  

 

 

===

Mel and I looked good together and we had in fact placed in several dance contests at the Coach House Inn a few years back. When the song ended Mel kissed me on the cheek and said: 

 "Call me; I've still got the same number." 

 When I got back to the table all three women were looking at me and it was Sarah who voiced the question that was on all of their faces. 

 "This is our song Bobby?" You just have to tell us the story behind that." 

 I gave it a few seconds thought and then and hen told them the story. 

 "I met Mel on a Saturday night at the old Coach House Inn. The band that is here tonight is the same band that was there that night. I was alone that night and Mel was at a table with three girlfriends. Her three tablemates were out on the dance floor and she was sitting there watching. I could tell from the way she was moving on her chair and the way her fingers were tapping on the table that she wanted to be out there too. 

 "I hadn't come to dance; I was just there for a drink or two and to listen to the music. I was the only other unattached guy in the place that night and I could see that she really, really wanted to be out on that floor so I got off my bar stool and went over and asked her. We hit the floor just as the tune ended. The band had been playing for a while and I figured that they were at a point to take a break. Mel must have thought that too because she got a huge look of disappointment on her face. 

 "We were surprised when the band started "Ride Cowboy Ride." Mel became all smiles and when I asked her if she knew eastern swing she said yes and so we got down to it. When the song ended the band took a break. I walked Mel back to her table and on the way she said: 

 "That was fun. I hope they do that number again tonight." 

 "When we got to her table she introduced me to her friends and then I excused myself and went to the bathroom. When I left the bathroom I asked the barmaid where the band took their breaks. I went there, introduced myself to Carlos, told him what Mel had said, and then offered him a fifty if he would play it again for her. He refused the money and said that he would happily do it for someone who liked his music. He told me that it wouldn't be in his next set because that would be too soon after the first time, but if we hung around for the set after next he would do it again. 

 "I went back and told Mel what Carlos had told me and I could see she was disappointed and I asked her why. She told me that she had ridden with her friends and they were getting ready to leave. I told her there was no problem and that I would take her home. Her friends left and I joined her at the table and when Carlos played Ride again we got up and danced to it. 

 "There are five or six pretty decent country/western bands in the area and they rotate through the C&W bars in the area. After we finished dancing Mel went to Carlos and asked him where he would be appearing next. On the drive to her place she told me where he was going to be on the next weekend and asked me to take her there. Since it was the first time a girl ever asked me for a date I told her that I would love to. The following Friday when we got to the bar where he was playing he recognized us and he did Ride Cowboy Ride three times that night. 

 "The next weekend when we showed up and he saw us come in and at the start of his next set he said, "This one is for Bob and Mel" and he went into "Ride." We followed him for two months and he always did "Ride" for us at least twice. So yes, I guess "Ride Cowboy Ride" could be considered our song." 

 When I finished I could see that they were expecting more, but I didn't have a clue as to what it was. Stacy enlightened me. 

 "And then what happened?" 

 "I don't understand your question." 

 "No surprise there. You are a typical clueless male. What happened with you and Mel?" 

 "Nothing. We were just friends. Good friends having a good time dancing. We even competed in several dance contests and did pretty well." 

 "Pretty well?" Sarah asked. "What does that mean?" 

 "A second place finish and two third places." 

 I could tell from the looks on their faces that they believed that there was a lot more to Mel's and my relationship than that and they were of course right, but it was none of their business. 

 For the next hour we sat, drank, munched on snacks, listened to the music and danced. I danced with all three and even though Stacy had said that I was a clueless male I fully understood the signals that both she and Sarah were sending me on the dance floor. From the way they moved in close and pressed against me it was obvious they both wanted me to make a move. I had already considered asking Sarah for a date, but with all three of them there I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I wouldn't mind a date with Stacy either, but I would need a situation where I was alone with either of them before I could ask. 

 Did I even consider Gwen in the mix? No I didn't. I still figured that she was way out of my league and I couldn't see setting myself up to get burnt. 

 The band came back from its break and Carlos, having seen me and Mel out on the floor, must have thought that it was like old times and he started the set with "Ride Cowboy Ride." Gwen stood up, grabbed my hand and said: 

 "It might once have been that woman's and your song, but tonight I'm making it OUR song!" 

 She literally pulled me off my chair and drug me out onto the dance floor. Once there I got into the swing of things and Gwen and I moved well together. When the dance was over she said: 

 "That was fun. We need to find out where he will be next week so we can do it again." 

 I was still trying to get a grip on the situation when we got back to the table. Before I could even sit down Gwen said to her two friends: 

 "I know that both of you sluts would like to get your hooks into him, but you can forget it. I told both of you about the relationship I had with him and I intend to pull him back into that relationship even if I have to drag him kicking and screaming all the way." 

 Then she turned to me and said, "Come on cowboy. You need to take me home." 

 I was so surprised by what was happening that I just stood there until Gwen took me by the arm and herded me out the front door. By the time I got my wits back about me we were at my car. I started to say something and Gwen put her hand over my mouth and said: 

 "Not now. Wait until we get into the car." 

 We got in and she said, "It was obvious that you were never going to get off the dime and make a move so I decided that I was going to have to do it." 

 By then I was at the parking lot exit and I put on my blinkers for a right turn out of the lot. Gwen asked: 

 "What are you doing? 

 "Taking you home." 

 "Turn left." 

 "Why? The way to your place is that way" and I pointed to the right. 

 "True, but the way to your place is that way" and she pointed to the left. 

 "My place? Why would you want to go to my place?" 

 "Well Stacy did say you were clueless, but she clearly underestimated just how clueless." 

 She slid over next to me and put a hand on the bulge in my pants and said, "I should have done this sooner and locked you in, but I went slow because I didn't want to scare you off." 

 As she pulled down my zipper I broke out laughing. 

 "What's so funny" she asked. 

 "I was taking things slow because I didn't want to scare YOU off." 

 By then she had worked my cock out of my fly and she said, "That's all ancient history now Bobby" and then her mouth closed around my cock. I'm not stupid and I'd read about guys getting their cocks bitten off in accidents so I pulled over to the curb, parked and leaned back to enjoy. Gwen stayed at it until she got me off. I told her I was going to blow, but she kept on going and swallowed it all. She licked my cock clean and said: 

 "You need to hurry up and get us to your place so I can get busy getting you back up." 

 She didn't get to do that. By the time I pulled up and parked in front of my place it was back to being hard as a rock. As soon as we were in the door the clothes started coming off. By the time we got to the bedroom Gwen was bare ass naked and all I had on were my socks. I sat down on the bed and started to remove my socks and Gwen grabbed my arm and pulled me to her a she said: 

 "Forget about your stupid fucking socks!" 

 She pulled me on top of her and pretty much snarled, "Fuck me damn you; fuck me!" 

 I did. I did three times that night. And a couple of times the next morning. And afternoon. And evening. 

 It was Sunday evening before I took Gwen home and she wanted me to come in with her, but I begged off. I was going to need some rest if I was going to be worth a shit at work on Monday.

 That was the start of it. We dated a couple of times a week and one of those dates was always on a Friday and every Friday we went to whatever lounge or bar that featured Carlos Washington. He always did "Ride Cowboy Ride" at least twice for us and our dates usually ended up in my bedroom or Gwen's. 

 Six months went by and I was pretty content with my life, but I soon found out that I was the only one content with things the way they were. It was a Tuesday night and I was at Gwen's place having dinner. I was pushing a forkful of mashed potatoes in my mouth when Gwen said: 

 "Don't make any plans for us for this weekend." 

 I finished what I had in my mouth and said, "Why? What's up?" 

 "We are going to spend the weekend at my parents and my brother Dave will be flying in from Dallas." 

 "Why are we doing that?" 

 "My family wants to meet my future husband." 

 "Your future husband? What am I missing here?" 

 "Obviously you are lacking the good sense to ask me to marry you and since you may never get your head out of your ass and do it I'm taking things in my own hands. We will spend the weekend with my family and my father will shake your hand, welcome you to the family and then tell you that if you hurt his little girl he will hunt you down and hurt you. 

 "My mother will hug you, tell you how many grandbabies she wants and then start planning the wedding. My brother Dave will shake your hand and then sound you out on how you feel about hunting, fishing and NASCAR. My sister will hug you, kiss you and try to steal you away from me and I will cut your nuts off with a dull knife if you do not instantly shut her down. You already know Tony and Alice so they will probably leave you alone. 

 "My grandparents will just stand in the background and shake their heads although my grandfather will probably try to catch you alone and tell you to run for your life. For that very reason I will probably spend most of my time keeping him away from you." 

 "Do I have any say in this?" 

 "Of course you do. There are several things you can say and it would probably be a good thing if you start practicing them. There is "Yes dear," "Whatever you want dear," "As you wish my love," "Of course dear" and the ever popular "Your wish is my command my love." 

 "Did it not occur to you that the reason I haven't asked you to marry me is that I don't want to get married?" 

 Her face lost its smile and she said, "You don't want to marry me?" 

 "Wanting has nothing to do with it. I'm afraid to marry you" and then I went on to tell her my thoughts and feeling on the matter. She sat there and listened to it pour out of me and when I was done she shook her head negatively and said: 

 "Aren't you selling yourself short? What makes you think that I'm out of your league? It can't be just my looks" she said and then she saw the look on my face when she said it. "That's it isn't it? Spill it Bobby. Get it out there." 

 "I'm nothing special Gwen. Decent physical shape, not really good looking, but not really bad looking either. I have nothing special to offer a woman like you. On the other hand men are attracted to you like flies are attracted to sugar and honey. Sooner or later one that has all the things I lack is going to get your attention and you will be gone. I don't want the hurt that will come when it happens." 

 "Unreal! Un-fucking real! Did you ever stop to think that the things you think you lack are things I don't give a rat's ass about? I know what I look like Bobby. I've had men and boys sniffing after me since I was twelve years old and in the years since then there have been hundreds who have taken a shot at me. Some were better looking than you, some were richer than you and even though it might not set well with you to hear me say it some were smarter than you. 

 "But none of them Bobby, not a single one, had that certain something that made me want to make them a permanent part of my life. You have it Bobby. It took me a while before I realized it, but you have it. I can't describe it; it is a feeling that says "Hang onto this one. Don't let him get away." What it boils down to Bobby is that you either want me or you don't. I want you, but as they say it takes two to tango. If you want me you have to get up off your ass and do what needs to be done. 

 "As they say down on the farm "Its nut cutting time!" What's it to be Bobby?"

 For the curious among you: 

 1. Her mother wanted four and she did immediately start planning the wedding. 2. Her brother found out that hunting and fishing were in and NASCAR was out. 3. I did shut down her sister Ilene and 4. It has been nine years and her father hasn't had to hunt me down and hurt me. 

 Oh, lest I forget. Her grandfather did get me alone and tell me to run for my life but I didn't and I'm damned glad that I didn't. 

 "Ride Cowboy Ride" is still our song and Carlos did it four times at our wedding reception. Report_Story
