 * 

 Ryan arrived at the restaurant an hour early. He knew this had to be perfect. 

 He hadn't been back here at O'Malley's for a few years now. It still looked the same. It was never the classiest place in the world, but it had character. It was a popular place among college students, which Ryan was when he had first met Anna. 

 They had both been undergrads when they had first met. He was in pre-med, and she was in pre-law. They had been set-up on a blind date through a mutual friend. It was baffling that they had never met. They were both star students, ivy-leaguers and clearly destined for success. They had first met at this bar and restaurant, O'Malley's. Ryan still remembered how nervous he was when he was entering the bar to meet her. Despite his success in the classroom, he had never been particularly successful with girls. It's not that he was bad looking, quite the opposite, he was actually very good looking. But he was extremely shy. He had had girls hit on him throughout high school and his first few years of college, but he was too shy to notice the signals they were sending out. He was a good guy, friendly and soft spoken. His parents had done a good job with him. 

 Ryan had walked into the bar that night, nervous, after going a few years without having a date. He was dressed in a polo shirt and khaki's. He looked around, checking for the girl he was supposed to meet. He looked around nervously, until he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up into the smiling face of the pretty brunette standing above him. 

 "Are you Ryan?" she asked. He looked at her. He was shocked to see how pretty this girl was. She couldn't be his date, right? 

 "Yeah." he said nervously, thinking this girl might be here to tell him his date wasn't showing up. 

 "I'm Anna." she said, holding out her hand. He shook it quickly, before they sat down. The rest of the night was a blur. Ryan had never been a smooth talker, but he found the words easy to come by as he talked to Anna for hours. The conversation between them was effortless, and Ryan gained more confidence in his words as the night progressed. 

 Ryan was in awe of Anna. She was so pretty and so easy to talk too. Plus, she was extremely intelligent. She was in pre-law, and you could immediately tell that she would be successful professionally. She clearly had the drive and ambition to go places. This was a feature that Ryan found extremely attractive. And she was so funny and charming. For Ryan, it was puppy love. 

 The night ended with them exchanging numbers, and Ryan had to stop himself from calling her immediately. When he did finally call, she was eager to see him again too. 

 From that point, their relationship was a whirlwind. They spent whatever free time they had together. All their friends said the same thing about them: they were a perfect couple. They were so cute together. They were meant to be. 

 Ryan grew up quite a bit thanks to Anna. Gone was the nervous, stuttering and repressed teen that got nervous around pretty girls. He was now a confident, charming man. His friends saw a new side of him as he was now more outgoing than ever. People loved the new him. And Anna loved him. And he loved Anna. 

 Anna had truly turned him from a boy to a man. Ryan lost his virginity to Anna after a few months of dating. As with most first times, it was more awkward than pleasurable. But, in due time, their lovemaking went from awkward to very good. He now saw what he had been missing out on while being a virgin. 

 So they dated for a few years, knowing in the back of their head that they would get married eventually. Everyone knew it. Why wouldn't they? He was going to be a doctor and her a lawyer. The perfect power couple. They were destined to have a great life together. 

 The only thing that delayed their inevitable union was their busy schedules. Ryan and Anna were too busy with school to take the time to get married. Ryan knew he was going to propose for awhile, but he was waiting for the right moment. He thought for a long time about the perfect romantic gesture, before he finally came up with the perfect idea. That's what led him back into O'Malley's, on his and Anna's three year anniversary. 

 Ryan scanned through the restaurant and saw that the table he wanted was open. He walked up to the hostess at the front. 

 "Hi." Ryan said to the hostess. 

 "Hi!" the perky hostess said with a bright smile. "How many?" she asked. 

 "Uh, it'll be two. Could I possibly get that table over there?" Ryan asked, pointing at the open table. 

 "Um, sure, no problem." she said, grabbing two menus. She led Ryan over to the open table and set the menus down. 

 "Enjoy your meal. Alicia will be over soon to serve you." The hostess said with a smile, before walking away. 

 Ryan sat there nervously, wanting to make sure everything was perfect. He looked around making sure he knew where everything was. He waited for the waitress to show up. He needed to discuss his plan with her. 

 He looked up as he saw a sour looking waitress walking towards him. She looked like she would rather be anywhere else. Ryan spied her nametag, and it said 'Jane'. Ryan sighed with relief as she walked by him. A girl with a sour mood would not have made his plan easy. He so was distracted by the sour looking waitress that he didn't notice his waitress bounce over to his table. 

 "Waiting for someone special?" A peppy female voice said. Ryan looked up at the waitress standing next to him. He was taken aback by how pretty she was. Stunning really. She had long brown hair down to her mid-back. Her face was gorgeous, with a slight tan. She had big, expressive eyes. She also had full, pouty lips, and she was displaying her bright white teeth as she smiled at him. She looked a couple years older than him, maybe 28 or 29. 

 "Uh, yeah, something like that." Ryan said. 

 "Hi, I'm Alicia. I will serve you today. Do you want me to come back when she gets here?" the waitress, Alicia, said knowingly. 

 "Well, it might be awhile before she gets here." Ryan replied. 

 "Well, do you want something to drink?" Alicia asked. 

 "I'll have a glass of water, thank you." Ryan said. 

 "Sure, I'll be right back." Alicia said, bouncing away. It was at this point that Ryan realized how good of a body she had. She walked in a way to highlight her great butt, which she had stuffed in a tight pair of pants. It looked round and firm. Ryan shook his head, clearing away his admiration of this waitress's body. He thought about his planned proposal, and how much he needed to let Alicia in on his plans. As Ryan saw Alicia emerge from across the restaurant, holding his glass of water, he noticed something else about her. 

 Alicia had really big breasts. Like huge. Just massive breasts. And she was wearing a tight blouse to really highlight them. He hadn't realized her tight black blouse was unbuttoned enough to give a hint of cleavage. She must use those to get the tips, Ryan thought. 

 Alicia returned to the table and set his water down. 

 "Big date?" Alicia asked with a smile. 

 "Well, kinda." Ryan said. 

 "How can something be kind of a date?" Alicia asked. 

 "Well, I'm waiting for my girlfriend. It'll still be a while before she gets here. I just wanted to make sure I got this table." Ryan said. 

 "Why do you want this table?" Alicia asked. 

 "Well, this is where we sat on our first date, and this is where I want us to be when I propose." Ryan said. 

 "Wait, are you proposing to her today?" Alicia said excitedly. Ryan reached into his pocket and pulled out the ring case. This caused Alicia to clap her hands excitedly, which in turn caused her boobs to bounce up and down, which Ryan noticed. She pulled the chair across from him out and sat down on it. 

 "Oh my God, this is so cute. Do you need me to do anything? Put the ring in her champagne or something like that?" Alicia said gleefully. 

 "Well, on our first date, I got her a chocolate milkshake for dessert. She said it was the best milkshake she ever had. So, I'm planning to buy her one for dessert today, and I was wondering if you could put the ring around the cherry on top?" Ryan explained. 

 "I would love to. This is so cool. I always wanted to do this, to be a part of a big, grand proposal like this." Alicia said, smiling bright. "Are you nervous?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yeah, a bit." Ryan said, laughing. 

 "Well, don't worry, I won't let you down." Alicia said. 

 "I know." Ryan said. 

 "So, do you want me to take the ring now?" Alicia asked. 

 "Uh, yeah, sure." he said, handing the ring case over to her. She couldn't help herself, and popped it open to check out the ring. 

 "What do you think?" Ryan asked. 

 "It's gorgeous." Alicia said, her eyes flashing. She snapped the case shut and looked at him. "I must say, I am jealous of this girlfriend of yours. I just hope, when the man of my dreams proposes to me, he puts as much thought into it as you did." This caused Ryan to blush. "Do you need me to do anything else?" Alicia asked. 

 "No, just don't give anything away when she gets here." Ryan said with a laugh. 

 "Don't worry. You're secret's safe with me." Alicia said, bringing her fingers across her lips as if closing a zipper. She stood up. 

 "You sure you don't need anything. Maybe something to calm your nerves?" Alicia suggested. 

 "Well, maybe I'll have a beer." Ryan said with a laugh. She took his beer order. 

 "When's the lucky girl gonna get here?" Alicia asked. Ryan checked his watch. 

 "About 45 minutes." Ryan replied. 

 "Should I be looking out for her?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yeah, sure. She's pretty. She has brunette hair, which she usually wears up. Her name is Anna." Ryan said. Alicia nodded. Ryan suddenly realized he hadn't introduced himself. "I'm Ryan by the way." He said, holding out his hand. She took his hand in hers. 

 "I'm Alicia. If you need anything else, let me know." she said, releasing his hand and walking away with a smile. Ryan sat nervously in his chair, waiting for Anna to arrive. 

 As Alicia walked into the kitchen, her smile faded. She reached into her pocket to check out the ring again. The diamond was a little smaller than she would prefer. Alicia knew when a guy proposed to her, he would have to put a big rock on her finger. She would be satisfied with nothing less. 

 "What's that?" one of her coworkers, Jane, said. 

 "Check it out. One of my customers is proposing to his girlfriend. Isn't that romantic?" Alicia said with a smile. Alicia hated Jane. Ever since Jane had started working here she had this attitude that she was better than everyone else there. She had a college degree! Oooohhh. Alicia didn't go to college. She knew everything she needed to know. And ever since Jane started, she had simply been a dreary little bitch. All day, every day, she bitched and moaned about how her husband had left her. By this point, Alicia knew the whole story. Jane's husband had left her for his bitch of a boss. Alicia couldn't really blame him, seeing what a sad sack Jane was. Jane was so hung up on her ex- husband that Alicia doubted she had dated since being dumped. 

 Alicia flat out despised her. Jane was no fun to be around, and everyone at the restaurant felt the same way. So Alicia loved to rub her personal life in Jane's face, and how she had men chasing after her. Alicia would discuss her personal life with Jane, even though she knew she hated it. She discussed her dates with Jane, and how men were fawning over her. She loved to piss Jane off and make her feel more depressed. 

 Alicia studied Jane's reaction. There was a twitch of jealously, and then she gave Alicia a faint smile. 

 "It's lovely." Jane said, before walking away quickly. Alicia smiled wickedly. She looked at the ring and then looked at Jane's retreating form. Alicia came up with a naughty idea. 

 *********** 

 About forty minutes had passed since Ryan had laid out his plan to the waitress. Alicia had been gone for awhile before chatting with Ryan a little more. She walked up front to notice a plain, boring looking girl standing up front. The hostess had stepped away so there was no one to greet her. Alicia stepped up to help her out. 

 "Can I help you?" Alicia asked. 

 "Hi, my name's Anna. I'm supposed to be meeting my boyfriend, Ryan." the girl said, scanning the interior of the restaurant. Alicia gave her a quick look, a look of surprise. A look that said, 'Really? Ryan's marrying this girl? He could do a lot better.' The moment passed. 

 "Yes, I will show you right over." Alicia said, leading Anna towards Ryan. As they walked, Alicia marveled at how mismatched this couple seemed. Ryan was a stud. He was tall, well muscled and was so damn cute. Plus, he was a sweet heart. A guy willing to put all of that effort into a proposal is a girl's dream come true. But, he was willing to do that for this girl? She was nothing special. A plain looking face, ratty looking hair and she had a dull body. She had no tits, and a bony ass. Plus, her cheap looking black dress did not flatter her at all. Alicia laughed to herself. If he was willing to go this far for such a plain looking girl, imagine what he would do for a girl that was actually attractive? 

 When they got within viewing distance, Ryan stood up and smiled. Anna walked over and hugged him and gave him a small peck. She sat down at the table across from him, sharing a look that conveyed such love for Ryan. It was clear that these two were definitely in love. 

 "Well, Anna, I'm Alicia, you're server. Can I get you something to drink?" Alicia said. Anna eyed her strangely before placing her order. 

 "I'll have a glass of white wine." Anna said. 

 "You know what, can you bring out a bottle for us?" Ryan asked. Anna looked at him, surprised. 

 "Sure." Alicia said with a bright smile, before bouncing away to place the wine order. 

 The rest of the dinner went by smoothly. Anna was surprisingly businesslike with Alicia, but other than that, she was in a great mood. As dinner winded down, Alicia revisited them again. 

 "So, guys, can I interest you in any desert?" she asked, giving Ryan a meaningful look. 

 "Uh, I don't think so." Anna said. Ryan started to panic. She had talked up that milkshake for years, saying it was the best she ever had. He had expected her to get one. 

 "Are you sure? I thought you really liked the milkshake you got here last time?" Ryan said. 

 "Yeah, but I'm pretty full." Anna said. 

 "C'mon. If you don't get it, you'll regret it." Ryan said. Anna thought to herself. 

 "Fine. One chocolate milkshake." she said. 

 "One milkshake coming up." Alicia said, heading back to the kitchen, her time for action now necessary. She waited patiently for the shake to be made. As she watched the whipped cream get sprayed on, and the cherry plopped on top, she knew the time was here. She retrieved the ring, and got ready to place it on the shake. 

 Ryan waited patiently, his eyes darting towards the kitchen, waiting for the waitress to emerge. He tried to maintain his conversation, but he was too nervous to fully pay attention. Finally, he saw Alicia emerge, carrying a frosty chocolate milkshake. She winked at Ryan as she walked towards him. 

 "Here you go." Alicia said cheerily as she set the milkshake in front of Anna. 

 "Thank you." Ryan said, nodding at Alicia. She smiled and stepped back, wanting to watch the festivities. Anna smiled at Ryan and pulled the glass towards her. As she leaned down to place her mouth on the straw, she saw it. 

 On the top of the shake, around the shiny red cherry, was a shiny gold ring. A shiny gold ring with a diamond facing her. Anna's eyes started to glisten with tears. Tears of joy. She looked at Ryan through the tears as she smiled brightly at him. Ryan stood up and grabbed the ring from around the cherry. Then, he got down on one knee. Anna turned to face him head on. 

 "Anna Franklin, will you marry me?" Ryan said. She nodded and smiled brightly. 

 "Yes. Of course. Yes!" she said with tears in her eyes. Everyone in the restaurant had been watching them. They started to clap as Ryan and Anna kissed. 

 "I love you." Ryan whispered. 

 "I love you too." Anna replied. As Ryan sat back down, Anna looked at him with such affection. Her cheeks were bright red. Ryan looked over at Alicia. She smiled brightly at him. 

 "Congratulations." Alicia said. 

 "Thank you, Alicia." Ryan said. She nodded at him as she stepped away, letting the happy couple enjoy their moment. 

 They basked in their new found engagement. Anna enjoyed the milkshake, calling it the best one she had ever had. As they finally finished up, Alicia returned to the table to drop off the check. Ryan quickly handed over his credit card, which she took to the register. She returned to his table a few minutes later. Anna had gone to the bathroom, so Ryan was waiting alone by himself. 

 "Alright Ryan, here you go." she said, handing over the receipt with a pen. 

 "Thanks again, Alicia, for all of your help." Ryan said, scribbling down the tip he planned to leave on the receipt. He planned to give her a big tip, equal to the total of the bill, as a way of saying thanks. 

 "Oh, no problem." Alicia said. "Oh!" she said, reaching into her pocket. She handed him back the ring case. "Here you go." 

 "Oh, thanks." Ryan said, grabbing it. 

 "All right, Ryan. Have a good night. You're welcome back here anytime." Alicia said. Ryan smiled. 

 "Thanks." he said. He watched Alicia walk away. He played with the ring case. He opened it, and was surprised to find a piece of folded-up paper inside. He unfolded it, and was surprised to see writing in pink ink. He read what was written. 

 "Call me." it said, followed by a phone number. After the number was one word. "Alicia." The I's were dotted with hearts. 

 He looked up to see Alicia walking into the kitchen. She looked over her shoulder at him, giving him a smirk. 

 What the hell? 

 *********** 

 Ryan was puzzled for the rest of the night by Alicia's actions. Why would she leave him her number? She couldn't possibly be hitting on him, could she? That'd be ridiculous! She took part in the engagement proceedings. She obviously knew he was taken. So what were her intentions? Did she want him as a friend? That would be the only explanation that would make sense. Even if that was the case, he would not be calling her anytime soon. 

 By the next day, Ryan had moved on from the whole thing. He was too busy telling his friends and family the news of his engagement. It wasn't until the evening that things settled down. Ryan and Anna decided to make their engagement Facebook official. As he went to do so, he saw he had a friend request. He clicked on it. 

 "Alicia Tahana has added you as a friend on Facebook" 

 Ryan saw the picture of the waitress's smiling face in her picture. Ryan generally never turned down a person's friend request, as long as he knew them. He thought, what the hell? It couldn't hurt. He accepted her friend request. 

 He changed his relationship status to 'engaged', and scanned the news feed as he waited for the comments to come in. He had a few people say congrats, and he responded and chatted for awhile. Suddenly, a new chat window appeared. It was Alicia. 

 "Thanks for friending me." she said.  

 

 

===

"Well, technically, you friended me." Ryan typed back. 

 "Well all that matters is that we're friends now." Alicia said. There was a pause before she sent another message. 

 "Why haven't you called me yet?" she asked. 

 "I didn't know why you wanted me to." Ryan replied. 

 "I wanted to thank you for the very large tip you left me." Alicia said. 

 "Well, you're welcome. I couldn't have done the engagement without you." Ryan replied, not putting together that she left him her number before he gave her the tip. 

 "Thanks!!! But I want to thank you personally. I'll get that number out of you eventually, then we can plan something." she replied. Ryan was confused by this statement. "Listen, I gotta head out to work. I'll talk to you tomorrow." 

 With that, she was offline. Ryan was a little confused. How did she want to thank him? And, wasn't she a little presumptuous to assume they would be talking again tomorrow? He was confused by this girl. He decided to check out her profile for the first time. 

 Her profile was one of those self-pictures with the girl holding the camera above herself so you could see her whole body in the picture. She was giving the kissy face in the picture. And front and center in the picture was her chest, with a few buttons unbuttoned on her blouse, exposing a hint of smooth cleavage. 

 Ryan started looking at her wall postings. The last thing posted on it was a new status from the day before that said "I met a boy today!!!" Ryan realized she must have had a busy day yesterday to take part in his engagement plans and to meet some guy. Ryan scanned the rest of her wall. She was one of those girls that had like five statuses a day, many poorly spelled, and most of them trivial. The other things on her wall were posts from her friends or those posts from guys where you could tell that they liked her but didn't realize she was out of their league. She had brushed them off deftly from what Ryan could tell. The other things on her wall were pictures from the various parties she attended. 

 Ryan moved on and decided to check out her information. Under interests she had boys, partying, hanging out with her girls, drinking and boy chasing. Her taste in movies was nothing special, mostly crappy romantic comedies. They were the types of movies that showed she had bad taste in cinema. Same with her music choices, just the girly pop music that played on the radio everywhere. 

 He looked down at her professional and educational information. Under her school information, she wrote "Skool iz 4 lozerz." He hoped that those misspellings were deliberately bad, but he wasn't so sure. He hoped she was being ironic. Her only other school info was her high school graduation. He was not surprised to see she never went to college. He didn't look down on her for it. He knew a lot of smart, successful people who never went to college. Then he looked at her professional info and saw that she had been waitressing for years at one place or another. She had been at O'Malley's for two years. Ryan realized she was not exactly a world beater, but hey the world needed waitresses. 

 Ryan started to look at her photo albums. She had a lot of them. Seventy percent of her pictures were from parties. All of her friends looked like typical airhead party girls. Anna surrounded herself with intelligent, friendly girls, the total opposite of the girls Alicia seemingly hung out with. Ryan didn't think any of Anna's friends would be caught dead with Alicia or any of her friends. 

 From her photos, Alicia seemed to like wearing skimpy clothes, since she wore them in most of her pictures. She also preferred skimpy bikinis as well, as the ones she wore in her beach photos showed a lot of skin. And, Alicia definitely knew that she had big breasts, because she took every opportunity to parade them. They took front and center in most of her pictures, but with boobs that big, it would be hard not to. Every shirt she wore was tight and low-cut. Every bikini left most of her breasts exposed. The most revealing outfit was a skimpy witch outfit that she wore for Halloween, and it was so low-cut that it went down to her belly button, exposing the entire length of her excellent, soft- looking cleavage. She always pushed them out, begging to be admired. She was a girl built to handle having big breasts. 

 Ryan hadn't realized he had been looking at her profile for about a half hour. He had been too distracted to realize he had a bunch of notifications letting him know people had commented on his engagement. On the day after his engagement, he had been too distracted by some waitress's big breasts to thank people for congratulating him on his engagement. 

 Ryan had classes for most of the next day and came home to the apartment he and Anna shared. He found Anna on the couch, working on her laptop. As he set his stuff down, Anna looked up at him. 

 "Hey, did you Facebook friend that waitress we had at O'Malley's?" Anna asked casually. 

 "She friended me." Ryan replied, hanging up his coat. 

 "How'd she get your name?" Anna asked. 

 "Hmm, I don't know. Maybe from my credit card." Ryan said. 

 "Isn't that a bit creepy, to get some guys name off of his credit card?" Anna asked. Ryan shrugged. He leaned over and kissed Anna on the top of her head. 

 "You have nothing to worry about. She's harmless." Ryan said, sitting down next to her on the couch. 

 "I don't know. Something about her bugs me. I got weird vibes off of her at the restaurant, and I'm getting weird vibes off of her now. Look, she went through your page and commented on a ton of your stuff. She's all over your Facebook now." Anna said, clearly irritated by Alicia. 

 "Do you want me to defriend her?" Ryan asked with a smile, clearly amused by Anna's annoyance. 

 "Don't make fun of me." Anna said with a laugh. Ryan reached over her and grabbed her shoulder and pulled her into him. 

 "What do you want me to do?" Ryan asked, snuggling with his fiancée. 

 "Just tell her to step off or something." Anna said. 

 "I think she's just being friendly." Ryan replied. 

 "Just be careful. I get weird vibes from her." Anna said. Ryan leaned down and kissed her head again. 

 "I'll be fine." Ryan said. 

 A few hours later, Ryan investigated his Facebook for the first time, and Anna was telling the truth. Alicia had commented on lots of things. She had made little comments on things on his wall and had gone through a lot of his pictures and made comments on those two. Most were harmless. The only one that caused him to squirm was a comment she made on a picture he had of himself shirtless on the beach. She had said "Nice!" in regards to his fit chest and torso. As if on cue, a chat window popped up. 

 "Hey!!!" Alicia said. 

 "Hey." Ryan replied. 

 "Why haven't you called me yet?" Alicia said. He could practically hear her pout. 

 "What do you want to talk about?" Ryan asked. 

 "You'll have to call and find out." Alicia teased. Ryan rolled his eyes. 

 "Listen, you can't comment on everything on my Facebook like you did." Ryan said. 

 "Why not?" Alicia replied. 

 "Because people might get the wrong idea." Ryan said. 

 "Did Anna not like it?" Alicia replied. 

 "No, she didn't. And I'm sure there are others." Ryan said. 

 "Well, I'll make you a deal. If you call me, I'll lay off on the Facebook stuff. Okay?" Alicia said. 

 "I'll think about it." Ryan said. 

 The next day, Anna had classes late but Ryan did not. He went online to check his Facebook, only to find Alicia had commented on more stuff. He knew he had to make a choice. Anna would get mad at him and get the wrong idea if she kept doing this, and Ryan would do anything to prevent jeopardizing his engagement. The only way to stop Alicia was to call her, even though he had no desire to. He didn't even consider defriending her. Ryan hated to make anyone mad. He finally picked up his iphone, pulled out the slip of paper Alicia had written her number on, and dialed in her number. With a sigh, he hit the call button. The phone rang twice before it was answered. 

 "Hello?" Alicia said. 

 "Alicia?" Ryan asked nervously. 

 "Yes. Who's this?" she asked. 

 "Uh, this is Ryan." Ryan said. 

 "Ryan! It's about time you called!" Alicia said excitedly. 

 "So, what do you want to talk about?" Ryan asked, not sharing her enthusiasm. 

 "Well, we have so much to talk about. We don't have to get into that immediately. How are you doing?" Alicia asked. 

 "I'm fine. And you?" Ryan asked. 

 "I'm great!" Alicia said. "How's the engaged life?" she asked. 

 "It's good. Going well." Ryan replied. 

 "How's school going? I had no idea you're gonna be a doctor." Alicia said. 

 "It's going well. Listen, is this all we're gonna talk about, because I have things to do?" Ryan said. 

 "Okay, fine, Mr. Grumpy pants." Alicia said. She paused then continued. "So, you know when you meet people and you get a sense about them? I just got this sense with you. I got the sense that you and I were meant to be great friends. Best friends. So... I was hoping we could hang out... and become the best friends we were meant to be. " 

 "Hang out and do what?" Ryan asked. 

 "Best friend stuff. We could just hang out and shoot the shit. We could go see movies together. Maybe hold hands when we walk down the street..." Alicia said. 

 "Wait, what?" Ryan asked. 

 "You know, best friend stuff. Holding hands. Maybe we could kiss when we get the chance. Normal best friend stuff. Maybe some naughtier stuff too, if you're game for it." Alicia said. There was a smile in her voice. 

 "What the hell are you talking about?" Ryan said. 

 "Well, where I come from, when a guy and a girl are best friends, they fuck each other. I was trying to keep things PG, but I felt like I needed to clear this up. I wanna be best friends with you Ryan." Alicia said. 

 "What!? Are you serious?" Ryan said, in shock. 

 "Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't I be?" Alicia said. 

 "Alicia, wow, I'm not interested." Ryan said. 

 "Yes you are." Alicia replied. 

 "Alicia, I'm engaged. I'm off the market." Ryan said. 

 "So? I date engaged guys and married guys all the time. It's fine. Engaged guys can still date girls." Alicia said. 

 "What are you talking about?" Ryan said. 

 "Ryan, I didn't realize you were this dense. I want to date you, Ryan. It doesn't matter that you're engaged. I want you. And if you're honest with yourself, I think you want me too." Alicia said. 

 "You're crazy!" Ryan said. 

 "Ryan, you were flirting like crazy with me when we talked at the restaurant. I caught all the signals. I know how badly you want to date women other than your fiancée. You don't give a waitress a fifty dollar tip unless you want to bang her." Alicia said. 

 "I'm hanging up." Ryan threatened. 

 "I just want you to think about one thing before you do. It's the only thing I've been thinking about... Just imagine how hot it would have been... You invited Anna to the restaurant. You planned out this great romantic moment. But when she gets there, you do something unexpected. How hot would it have been if you invited her there, and then you put that ring on my finger? How hot would it have been to propose to some slutty waitress in front of your girlfriend? Just think about that..." Alicia said. With that, she hung up. 

 Ryan stood there, stunned. He couldn't believe how big of a slut this girl was. She would have to be if she was trying to date a guy who was already engaged. Ryan wasn't afraid of her. She was just a slut. What could she possibly do? 

 *********** 

 Ryan cut ties with Alicia as best as he could. He defriended her on Facebook, and ignored her when she tried to call. After a few days, the calls stopped, and Ryan figured he was out of the woods. She was just a stupid, slutty girl. Nothing he couldn't handle. 

 Anna had been suspicious of Alicia ever since she met her. She had been stalking her on Facebook ever since she friended Ryan. She was happy when Ryan defriended her, but Anna was not convinced this bitch was gone for good. Then something strange happened. She had gotten used to seeing an empty spot where it listed mutual friends between her and Alicia, but suddenly, some of her girlfriends appeared in that spot. Alicia had started to become friends with Anna's friends. One after another, her friends became Alicia's friends. Anna contacted some of her friends, and nonchalantly asked them about Alicia. She generally heard the same story. They had met this girl Alicia, and she was a cool girl. Anna couldn't help but think this was an attack against her. 

 Anna was further shocked in the coming weeks to see pictures of some of her friends at party's with Alicia. This shocked her more than anything. Seeing her normally reserved, intelligent friends hanging out with that slut. And they were wearing such slutty clothes. She didn't realize her friends had that side to them. 

 Anna tried to hang out with her friends, but they always said they were busy. It was infuriating to see the pictures the next day on Facebook of her circle of friends hanging out with Alicia at some party from the night before. And none of her friends invited her! And watching her friends chat like idiots on Facebook with Alicia made her sick! Anna started to distance herself with those girls. If they wanted to be friends with that girl, then she didn't want to be friends with them. 

 Anna was not convinced that Alicia was done taking shots at Ryan. She snuck a peek at Ryan's phone, and noted that she had been calling and texting him, but he never responded. This made Anna smile. He was a good fiancé. 

 But there were other things that caused Anna concern. Things that raised Alicia's threat level in Anna's opinion from minor nuisance to a possible threat. Not a threat to her marriage but a threat to her safety. Every so often when she came home, she would see the same silver car parked across the street. Anna could tell that someone was in the driver's seat, but as she tried to look and see who was there, the car would either drive off, or the shade from the tree the car was parked under would prevent Anna from seeing who was inside. But Anna was pretty sure who was inside. Anna was pretty sure that bitch waitress was inside, watching her, studying her. But Anna didn't know for sure. 

 Anna wouldn't just see the car at home. At work, she would see the car parked within view of the entrance. Anytime Anna would try to approach the car, it would drive off. This happened a few times. Anna would visit Ryan at work too, and she would see that same fucking car there. Anna knew that bitch was watching them. 

 But this didn't bother Anna as much as what happened next. Anna came home one day, while Ryan was still working. As she walked in, something seemed off. Things looked like they had been messed with. Pictures slightly moved. Drawers slightly ruffled through. Things were just off. Ryan doesn't come home till late in the day, so it wasn't him that did this. Nothing appeared to be missing, though. Anna went to her bedroom, and she got the same sense that something was off. It looked like her drawers had been gone through. It looked like the bed sheets were ruffled, as if someone had lied on the bed. Plus, there was a smell in the air. A smell she couldn't quite place. Anna didn't know if these things were actually there, or if she was going nuts. But it felt like there was a lead weight in her stomach. For the first time, she was a little afraid of Alicia. If that bitch was capable of breaking and entering, what else would she do? 

 This didn't just happen once. Every few days, Anna got the sense that someone had been in her home. Things were again off, but nothing was ever missing. Anna just started to wonder why? Why would that bitch, because Anna just knew it was that skank waitress, come into her home and take nothing? Anna started to think that maybe that skank was leaving something behind. Maybe she left a camera or something to spy on them. Anna would drive herself nuts, looking everywhere for a spy camera, but she never found a thing. Anna thought she was going nuts. She couldn't tell Ryan, because he would think she was crazy. He didn't want him to see her like that. Crazy and paranoid with fear. Then, the letters started to come. 

 Anna started receiving letters in the mail, with no address. It was as if someone was personally dropping them off in her mailbox. The letters consisted of only a few words each. One of them just said 'Bitch'. One said 'Cunt'. And they just kept coming. They would say 'Ugly', or 'Flat', or 'Plain', or 'Fat'. These words were slanders against her. Anna was confident enough in her looks to not be affected, or at least that's what she told herself. She thought she was pretty, and she didn't think she was a bitch or a cunt. Sure, she didn't have big, bulging breasts, but men didn't care about tits that much. Also, she was happy with her weight. She looked healthy, not fat. She could stand to lose a few pounds, sure, but Ryan didn't seem to mind. 

 She knew these letters all came from the same place, because they were all written in lipstick. Deep, red lipstick. And, each of these letters had a signature. A calling card. But it was not a name. It was a kiss. The person who had written these notes had kissed the paper under the nasty words, leaving a lip-print on the paper. Anna had taken off of work a few times, waiting for Alicia to show up, but she never came. Anna didn't know whether she should call the police or just handle this herself. But then, Alicia did something that made up Anna's mind. 

 Anna got home, and again had that feeling that someone had been inside. She shook it off and went up to her bedroom. She dropped off her stuff and stepped into the bathroom. As she turned on the light and looked into the mirror, she gasped loudly and stepped back. On the mirror were the words, "Ryan will be mine, bitch", written in the same recognizable red lipstick. There was a kiss on the mirror below the words. Anna steeled herself, incensed at Alicia for doing this. Part of Anna was relieved that she wasn't crazy, that Alicia had been in her home. Anna picked up the phone and called the police. This bitch would get it. The dispatcher said they would send an officer out her way soon. 

 Within a few minutes, Anna heard a car pull into the driveway. She opened the front door and waited for the cop to get out of his car. The driver's door opened, and Anna was surprised to see the cop was a woman. A gorgeous woman. Anna noticed two things about her immediately: she had big tits and a bad attitude. Anna couldn't help but notice the cop's extremely large breasts, which her uniform top clung to. Anna noticed her body did not quit. Her legs were long, and as she turned to shut her door, Anna couldn't help but notice her nice, round butt. As the cop turned to face her, Anna realized her face held up its end of the bargain. Her face was strikingly gorgeous, with perfect skin, full, pouty lips, and long shiny hair tied in a bun. Large aviator glasses covered her eyes, and Anna got the impression that this cop would rather be anywhere else. This female cop was the total package. The cop walked up to Anna. 

 "Ms. Franklin, is it?" the cop said, holding out her hand. 

 "Yes, you can call me Anna." Anna said. 

 "I'm Officer Veronica Rivera. How can I help you?" the cop, Veronica, said. 

 Anna quickly explained the situation. About Alicia, and how she met her. Anna explained how she thought she was being followed. Anna showed the cop the letters, and then showed her the message on the mirror. The cop pulled out a few evidence bags. She took all the letters, and put them in a bag. She took photos of the mirror, and she took chips of the lipstick off of it. Then, she made an impression of the lips, and she swabbed the lip-print for DNA. 

 "I thought they had people to do this? I didn't know cops did this stuff." Anna said, making conversation.  

 

 

===

"I know what I'm doing." Veronica said, clearly disinterested in talking. 

 "I didn't mean to offend you, I just..." Anna started. Veronica stood up straight and started talking, interrupting Anna. 

 "Okay, ma'am. I've taken all the evidence I need. Feel free to clean this all up. I will get back to you if I find anything. I'll also have a talk with this Alicia you told me about. See what she has to say for herself." Veronica said. 

 "Okay, great!" Anna said. "Do you have a card or something?" 

 Veronica handed over her card, and then took Anna's number before leaving, evidence in hand. Anna was excited to see this bitch Alicia get her due. For justice to be done on her. But Anna was dismayed as a few weeks passed with no word from the police. She didn't tell Ryan any of this, not wanting to worry him. She waited and waited, before growing too impatient and deciding to call Officer Rivera. 

 "Officer Rivera, this is Anna Franklin. I was just wondering if you had gotten anywhere with my case?" Anna asked. 

 "Yes, Ms. Franklin. I'm sorry to say the evidence was inconclusive. I talked to Ms. Tahana, and she had an alibi. I'm sorry to say that without any more evidence, there is nothing we can do." Officer Rivera said. 

 "You're kidding? How can that be? It made sense. How can she get away with this?" Anna asked, confused. 

 "She's not getting away with anything. All evidence points to the fact she didn't do this." Veronica said. 

 "How is that possible? There isn't any other possibility. I know she did this!" Anna said. 

 "I'm sorry I can't help you Ms. Franklin. If anything else happens, let me know." Veronica said. 

 "But..." Anna started, but the cop hung on her. 

 Anna was pissed. She knew Alicia did this. She knew it. And she would not let her get away with it. She wanted this bitch out of their life for good, which is why she was on her way to O'Malley's to give the crazy bitch a piece of her mind. 

 Anna stepped into the restaurant with a purpose. She ignored the hostess as she looked around for that bitch, Alicia. She finally saw her, prancing out of the kitchen. Anna stormed over to her. 

 "Hey!" Anna said, grabbing Alicia's attention. Alicia looked at Anna as Anna blocked her path. She gave Anna a perky smile. 

 "Can I help you miss?" Alicia said. 

 "Cut the bull, Alicia. You know who I am, bitch!" Anna said tersely. The people around them looked up at them. 

 "I have no idea who you are." Alicia replied. 

 "You know who I am, and I know what you are doing. Stay away from my man, or you will pay." Anna growled. 

 "Are you threatening me?" Alicia said with a knowing smile, a smile which made Anna want to rip her face off. Before she could, a very large man stepped in between them. He asked Anna to leave, and she had no choice but to do so. But on her way out, she left that bitch with one parting remark. 

 "I'm not losing my man to some skanky waitress!" 

 As she left, she was feeling a bunch of emotions. She was buzzing with adrenaline, having never fought for her man like that. Also, she was a little embarrassed at making such a scene, but it was definitely worth it. She had made a stand for her man. She had never felt prouder of herself. 

 When she had gone home, she was feeling great about herself. And she was still buzzed from her encounter with Alicia. So when she saw her fiancé at their home, she immediately started to get those frisky feelings. She shocked Ryan with a passionate kiss before pulling him into the bedroom. 

 Anna and Ryan's sex life was good. They always enjoyed making love. They weren't into any of the kinky stuff, but Ryan was satisfied with his sex life with Anna. They would have sex a couple times a week, whenever Anna was in the mood. Spontaneous encounters like this one rarely happened. 

 A week passed from this day and they had not heard a peep from Alicia. Anna was smugly satisfied that she had taken that bitch down a peg. That was until there was a knock on the door. Anna opened to see a run-down looking man. 

 "Anna Franklin?" the man said. 

 "Yes?" Anna replied, confused. He handed her a folded stack of paper. 

 "You've been served." the man said, before turning and walking away. 

 Anna opened the papers, and realized she was holding a restraining order. That bitch Alicia had filed a restraining order against her. She couldn't go within 500 feet of her. Not that she wanted to, but still. Ryan walked up behind her. 

 "What is it?" Ryan asked. Anna was forced to explain what she did to Alicia. Anna went back and explained everything. How Alicia had been spying on them. How she sent the letters. How she broke in to their home. Ryan was unhappy with her for keeping this from him. Part of him also thought that maybe Alicia didn't do this. Sure, he had hit on him. But she was just a slut. Not a crazy stalker. That's a big line to cross, and he didn't think Alicia was capable of doing that. She had given up on him. Plus, he had faith in the justice system, and if the cop found no evidence, and if Alicia had an alibi, then maybe she didn't do it. Maybe Anna was fixating on this waitress. Maybe she was threatened with her. 

 Ryan didn't know how to explain the letters and the message on the mirror, because he never had the chance to see them. Nevertheless, he changed the locks on the door and was starting to make sure he wasn't being followed. He wanted to trust Anna and show his faith in her. He never saw the mystery silver car that Anna had seen. He distanced himself even more from the waitress, just to be safe. A small part of him wondered if Anna was making this all up. If maybe she was a little crazy. 

 Anna hated when Ryan was mad at her. Things were a little chilly between them for a bit. Anna was embarrassed by the whole thing. Alicia was scheming to steal her man, and Anna gets painted as the bad guy! As the crazy one! Sometimes, there was no justice. 

 ********* 

 Ryan was unhappy with what Anna did, but he knew those feelings would pass. He just wanted this whole thing with this waitress to be over and done with. But Alicia had other plans. She was ready to play her trump card. She knew that once she did, Ryan would jump out of his marriage and into her pants. 

 Ryan was at home alone when he received a text from Alicia. He had thought about changing his number, but it would be too complicated as his cell was his contact number for work, and would be too much of a pain to change. Plus, he was not afraid of Alicia. He could handle her. 

 Ryan was about to ignore it when he noticed that it was a picture text. This worried him, and he wanted to ignore it, but his curiosity got the best of him. He opened up the text, and the image made his jaw drop. 

 There was Alicia, with a huge smile on her face. He recognized her outfit as the same one she was wearing when they first met at the restaurant. It looked like she was in the bathroom of the restaurant. She was holding her hand up, fingers extended, and on her finger was the engagement ring he gave to Anna. He couldn't help but respond. 

 "You put on the ring?" Ryan said. He waited impatiently for a response. His phone dinged quickly. 

 "That's not all I did..." she teased. Ryan gulped in fear in what she did to the ring. Suddenly, a picture was getting sent his way. He waited impatiently for the picture to reach him. It finally did and he was shocked by what he saw. 

 

 In the photo, Alicia had turned around, and she was not wearing pants! Just below her tight shirt was her near-bare ass! She was wearing a skimpy black thong that exposed the firm round ass cheeks of that psycho waitress. She had reached back to palm one of her ass cheeks, and was squeezing the cheek gently, the flesh of her firm ass gently bulging from between her fingers. Ryan could see the ring on her finger pressed against her ass cheek. 

 "Bitch." Ryan mumbled angrily. He sent that word over to her via text. 

 "Ha Ha Ha!" she quickly replied. "Don't worry, there's more..." 

 Then, another photo was on the way. Ryan waited impatiently as the photo loaded. Then it appeared. 

 Alicia was sitting on a toilet. She had pointed the phone downward towards her crotch. The skimpy material of the thong was covering her vagina. Then Ryan realized that her fingers were under panties. Her face was visible in the photo, and her eyes looked heavy with lust. Her breasts were bulging from under her shirt, and her nipples were apparent under her blouse. 

 "That rock felt so good against my clit." She texted him. Ryan was frozen with shock. Then, yet another picture was getting sent his way. What else could she have done? 

 The next one was the most scandalous yet. She had turned around again. The picture was just of her ass. But the hand with the ring was in the shot. She had pulled her thong to the side. Her ring finger was wet looking, and it was pressed against her asshole. The engagement ring Ryan gave Anna was an inch away from this bitch's asshole. 

 One more picture arrived. It was a similar shot, but one thing was different. The ring finger and the ring had disappeared up Alicia's asshole! That bitch! 

 Ryan tried to put together what had happened. He had given her the ring, and she had gone to the bathroom and used it to play with herself before giving the ring back to him for the engagement. What an evil bitch! Everything Anna had said about her was right! 

 One last picture arrived. It was a picture of Alicia's chest, clothed, luckily. But, she had spread her blouse, revealing a mile of cleavage. There, connected to a necklace, was the ring, snugly nestled in her cleavage between her massive tits. There was so much breast flesh that it was apparent that ring was not going anywhere. 

 "That ring belongs to me. I made it mine." she texted. Ryan was still in shock at how she had perverted such a pure symbol. 

 "How do you think Anna will react to these pictures? How will she react to seeing her ring used in such a lovely way? She won't want to wear this one after she knows where it's been. Do you think she'll make you buy a new one? For a poor college student, it would cost a lot of money..." she texted to him. 

 

 Ryan was cornered. He knew Anna would want a new ring if she saw these pictures. He had spent a good chunk of money on that one. He could get by okay on their bills now. He couldn't if he had to buy a new ring. Alicia had him trapped. 

 "What do you want?" he texted back, knowing he essentially was being blackmailed. She replied quickly, clearly a fast and experienced texter. 

 "I just want one date. Just let me make my case to you why we should be together, and at the end, if you feel the same way you do now, then you'll never see me again. I'll be out of your life forever. Sound good?" she texted. Ryan thought it out. He had to get this bitch out of his life for good. He might have to cater to her whims to do so, but it was a risk he had to do it for the sake of his marriage. 

 "Fine." he texted back. 

 "Yay!!!!" she texted, before adding, " How does Thursday at six sound?" 

 Thursday was the one day of the week Anna had classes late, so Ryan could conceivably have this date then without Anna asking any questions. 

 "That'll be fine." Ryan said, cementing plans for a date with a woman who was not his fiancée. 

 "Yay! TTYL." she texted back. That was it. The conversation was over. That psycho waitress had forced him into a date. He was shocked. How did he get to this point? 

 ********** 

 Ryan was in a daze the rest of the week. He put up a good front in front of Anna, not wanting her to know that Alicia had gotten to him. But he was terrified at what this "date" with Alicia would entail. He just wanted to get past it and on with his life. 

 He would check his phone constantly, waiting for some sort of message from Alicia letting him know her plans for the date. But she sent nothing. She sent no messages about specifics for their date. Ryan hoped that maybe she wasn't going to go through with it, and he would be spared this indignity. But he was still nervous as Thursday approached, just knowing that she would have something up her sleeve. 

 He still hadn't heard from her by Thursday afternoon. He didn't want to ask her what her plans were because he didn't want to push for this rendezvous to happen. Six o'clock approached and Ryan had dressed up a little, just in case this date was happening. Anna wouldn't be home till around eight. So if this date did happen, there would be more than enough time to finish it and get home without Anna noticing. 

 Ryan checked his watch as it reached six. As he did so, he heard the doorbell ring. Oh no. It couldn't be. Ryan walked to the door in a daze and opened it. His fears were confirmed. Alicia was at his door. And she was dressed to kill. 

 Alicia was wearing a tight, slinky black dress that looked a size too small for her. It clung to her body, and it was stretched out in the right places, mainly around her breasts and ass. The dress was low cut and revealed a lot of her chest. Her boobs were oozing out, desperate to be free from their constraints. The spaghetti straps at the top of the dress were strained to the limit due to having her large breasts forced into the tight gown. Her skirt was down to her mid-thigh, and clung to her round butt. Her hair was let down and she was made up perfectly. Despite his feelings about her, he had to admit she looked spectacular. 

 "Hey Ryan!" she said with a bright smile. 

 "How do you know where I live?" Ryan asked suspiciously. 

 "I have my ways." she said in a sing-song voice. Ryan realized she was holding a box in her hands. 

 "What's in the box?" he asked. 

 "You'll find out." she teased. 

 "Okay then... So what's the plan?" Ryan asked. 

 "Well, I was thinking we could stay here, eat in tonight. I think you can make me a nice meal and we can get to know each other a little better." she said, stepping past him and inside his home, as if she owned the place. She set the box down and looked at Ryan as he closed the door. 

 "Um, I don't think this is a good idea. Anna will get here when her class is done. You can't be here... in our house." Ryan said. 

 "Don't worry, honey. I have a plan." Alicia said. Little did Ryan know that Alicia had many friends, including the police officer parked down the street to keep an eye out for when Anna tried to come home. 

 Alicia walked around, admiring Ryan's home. Ryan couldn't help but admire Alicia's round ass as she walked. 

 "So... what do you want to eat?" Ryan asked. 

 "Whatever you're best at. I want you to cook me up your best meal." Alicia said brightly. 

 "Uh, I make a really good taco salad." he offered. 

 "Sounds good." Alicia said. 

 Ryan kept one eye on Alicia as he began to cook up the meat for the salad. Alicia was checking out some of the pictures of Ryan and Anna on the wall before sashaying into the kitchen. 

 "So, how long have you two been together?" she asked. 

 "About three years now." Ryan responded tersely. He wanted to make as little conversation as possible with this slut. 

 "You know, I've always thought that when you meet that special someone, and you know its true love, you put that ring on her finger as soon as possible. You don't wait three years." Alicia said. Ryan rolled his eyes, this bitch clearly not understanding how relationships work. Alicia could sense his annoyance, so she walked up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. He jumped away from her touch, as if it burned. 

 "Don't touch me." he said. 

 "Sweetie, you don't have to be scared. I know it's tough to have these feelings for a woman who's not you fiancée. Don't worry, it'll get easier." Alicia said. 

 

 "How can you be such an evil bitch?" Ryan yelled, turning to face her. "You stalk a man who's engaged. You deface an engagement ring. You blackmail an engaged man into a date. How can you feel good about yourself? How can you be this calm?" 

 "Ryan, when you meet your true love, you go out of your way to be with them. You do anything it takes to be with them. I would do anything to be with you, Ryan. If that means using your engagement ring to get myself off, if it means I have to make you dump your boring-ass fiancée, then I'll do it. I know it won't be easy to dump her, but all of us know you care about me more than you care about her. Don't worry, it'll be worth it. I'll do anything for you. I'll do anything with you. Anything." she said, stepping close to him. Ryan backed away, not wanting to be close to this immoral slut. He turned away and went back to cooking, trying to do anything to take his attention away from this evil bitch. 

 She had fixated on him. You see it all the time. They only knew each other for less than an hour before she started doing these evil things. Her warped mind saw him as her true love. She couldn't be more mistaken, he thought. He was disappointed in himself for doubting Anna. Everything Anna had accused Alicia of was true. It had to be. Alicia was as crazy as Anna had said. 

 Alicia could sense his anger, so she made small talk with him as he cooked. She asked how he and Anna met, and he told her the story. As they sat down at the dinner table, the food ready, she started asking him about him and Anna's future. 

 "So you're gonna be a doctor, and her a lawyer, right?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yes." Ryan replied. 

 "So what's the point of you two getting married? You're never gonna see each other, you both will be so busy?" she asked. 

 "We'll find a way." Ryan said. 

 "Mmm, Ryan this is sooo good." Alicia said, taking a bite of the meal Ryan had prepared. Ryan slightly nodded in appreciation. His eyes couldn't help but glance at her cleavage as she looked away for a moment. She had very good posture and she sat up straight as she ate. This allowed her breasts to be jutting out front and center. He couldn't help but admire their immense size. Those suckers were huge! They were definitely real. He could tell by their round shape and the way they pressed against each other in just the right way, forming that soft, tasty looking cleavage. He realized he was staring, so he looked up into her watchful gaze. Her eyes twinkled at him as she knew he had just checked her out. She smiled. Ryan turned all of his attention to his meal. There was an awkward pause. Alicia finally broke the silence. 

 "What I'm saying is what's the point of being married to a girl that you'll barely see? You should marry a girl who'll be there for you, waiting for you when you get home, ready to do whatever you want..." Alicia stated. 

 "Wow, you're really setting back the feminist movement, aren't you?" Ryan asked. Anna was a big feminist and was eager to provide a good example to younger girls by being a professional and getting a good job, not settling for being a homemaker. 

 "So? You think I care? You probably care about that feminist bullshit as much as I do, which is to say, not at all. In the back of most men's minds, they truly want a woman who'll be at home for them, waiting to take care of them after a long day's work. They don't want a woman who slaves away at work all day and is just as exhausted as her man when she gets home. A man wants a wife who'll be there for him. And for any real woman, they would rather let their man do the work and let them have the good life, and not have to have her lift a finger or rustle a hair on her pretty little head. I guarantee any woman worth a damn would rather do that than silly work all day. And the women who don't are fucking morons. All that those men ask in return is for their women to look pretty and make babies. And, honestly, that's what I'm built for. Let those feminists give their speeches. I'll be too busy fucking their men to notice." Alicia said. 

 After listening to Alicia set back the women's movement back fifty years, Ryan was in shock. This was a woman who not only approved of, but glorified gold- digging. She was proud to sit at home or go shopping all day as her man worked and got her spending money. Ryan was stunned. And the only thing she would provide in return is a womb for making babies. And those massive breasts. He couldn't help but glance at them again. Every time she would lean down to take a bite, her breasts would press into the table and balloon outward. They were so big. They had to be EE-cups!  

 

 

===

"Are you and Anna planning to have kids?" Alicia asked, capturing his attention. 

 "Um, not right away. She said she wants to wait a few years." Ryan replied. 

 "Do you want to have kids?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yes, of course." Ryan said. 

 "Does Anna know this?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yeah, we talked about it." Ryan replied. 

 "Does she want kids?" Alicia said. 

 "Have you been listening to me? Anna wants kids too. She seemed open to it." Ryan started. 

 "Did she ever say, 'I want kids'?" Alicia asked. 

 "Well... not that I remember." Ryan said. 

 "Hmm, that's what I thought. Ryan, she's lying to you. She doesn't want kids. She's a scheming little bitch, and trust me, I know scheming little bitches. She'll make you wait a few years, and when you bring it up, she'll say 'Oh, not now, it's too busy now to have kids. It'll just be a few more years.' You'll wait patiently, like a good husband, and she'll keep putting it off, then finally she'll say 'I'm too old to start having kids'. You'll start to put together the pieces that she never wanted kids, but you're too deep in your marriage to get out by that point. If you stick with her, Ryan, you'll never have the children you're so desperate to have." Alicia said. 

 "That's not true." Ryan said. 

 "Okay, fine. Don't believe me. Just don't come crawling back to me when you realize the truth." Alicia replied. They continued their meal in silence. Ryan took another glance at Alicia's chest. He realized that if he looked real hard, he could see a slight outline of her nipples under her too-tight dress. 

 "It's probably best, you know, that you don't have kids with her. She's not exactly good looking. She'd probably have pretty ugly kids anyway." Alicia said. 

 "Fuck you." Ryan responded to the slander against his future wife. 

 "It's true, and you know it. You know you could do better. I'm guessing she was your first, right? She helped you grow into the man you are today. Now, you feel obligated to stay with her, even though in the back of your head you know you could do better." she said. 

 "You don't know what you're talking about." Ryan replied. 

 "Hmm, of course not." she said with a smug smile. Was there any truth to any of the things she said? Could it be possible that Anna didn't want kids? She had been noncommittal whenever they discussed it. Usually, if someone wanted kids they were pretty emphatic about it. Could it be that she actually didn't want kids? Could it be that Alicia was right? 

 "She probably wouldn't be a good mother anyway." Alicia started. "She strikes me as the type to just hire a nanny to do all the hard stuff. She would be too busy to actually care for her children. Not like me. I would be a great mommy. I can't wait to be a mommy." 

 Ryan was shocked again at her statement. 

 "You don't strike me as the type to want kids. You seem like too much of a... free spirit." Ryan said. 

 "You saying I'm too big of a slut to want kids?" she said with a smile. A trace of a smile appeared on Ryan's face before he caught himself. "I want loads of kids. Just look at me. I'm built for it. I'm built to be bred." Ryan was again shocked at her honesty and self-awareness. This bitch was saying that she was put on this planet to breed. Her sole purpose was to be bred. But, he had to admit, for any man looking at her, trying to breed with her would be their first thought. 

 "I know who I am, Ryan. I am a slut. I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm proud of it. I know that I do my best work in the bedroom. It's what I'm built for. I was put here to fuck. Trust me, guys take one look at me and know where my true talents lie. I'm not fighting my true nature. I love to fuck. I'm really good at it. I know things that your little fiancée wouldn't dream of knowing. Anyone can tell just by looking at her that she's bad in bed. Girls like me can tell. Any slightly intelligent woman could tell that the woman you saddled yourself with is horrible in bed. Everyone will know that." Alicia said. 

 "That's not true." Ryan stuttered out. 

 "Oh really? Do it! Tell me how spectacular your fiancée is at sex. Make me believe it!" she said with a skeptical smile. 

 "She's, uh, she's good in bed." Ryan replied nervously. Ryan always enjoyed having sex. Anna more than met his expectations in bed. They had fun together, but he had always wondered how some people could describe sex as such a life- changing experience. Sex was fun for him, but not life-changing. Could it be he was missing out on something? 

 "Oh, very good. I can really sense the passion you feel." Alicia said sarcastically. She was starting to get the upper hand. She stood up. 

 "Look at me, Ryan. I'm fucking hot. You can't deny that. Hotter than your fiancée. I have Anna beat in every category. I'm prettier than her." she pointed at her face as she smiled wide. "My hair is longer and more beautiful than hers." she said, combing her fingers through her long, shiny, lustrous brown hair. "My lips are softer and poutier." she said with a kissy face. "Now, look at my stomach." She had been moving downward, but she skipped one important feature. Well, two important features."My stomach's nice and flat. I keep myself in great shape. She's already fighting the bulge if you know what I mean... Look at my legs." She said, posing with one leg in front of the other. "Nice and long and firm. I don't think what she has compares to these." she said, before turning around. She straightened out her skirt around her ass to highlight her butt next. "My ass is just perfect. Round, firm, and perky. Not bony like some girls... like Anna's." She turned back around. "I have a nice, sexy tan. Evidence of how much care I put into my body." She looked into his eyes. They both knew the next thing or things she was about to point out. "Now, look at these suckers." she said, cupping her massive breasts and gave them a little bounce. "Feel free to look. I know how hard it is not to stare. From now on, you can look at them whenever you want. They're so much bigger than you fiancée's. Anyone with eyes can tell her mosquito bites don't compare to my massive boobies. Anyone can tell that you need a woman with big tits in your life." She gave her now hardened nipples a pinch before releasing them. 

 Ryan couldn't help but realize that Alicia was right. In any measurable way, Alicia was sexier than Anna. Every part of Alicia's body was superior to Anna's. Her face was prettier. Her lips were poutier. Her hair was more stylish. Her legs were longer. Her stomach was firmer. Her ass was rounder. Her tits were much bigger. Looks-wise, Alicia was superior. But looks weren't everything, right? 

 The insults Alicia made against Anna inspired hatred against Alicia. She was a catty, evil bitch. How could anyone be that blunt and mean about someone else? Those vicious insults against Anna and her body were over the line. 

 "You know if you turn me down, you will never get a chance to see these in the flesh. Do you think your marriage will survive your fetish for big tits? If you turn these down, you will keep thinking about them, wishing you had the balls to dump your fiancée so you could see them. So you could feel them. So you could taste them. You'll keep checking out big-titted women, indulging your fetish whenever you can. Eventually, it will consume you. The need to have a big, fat pair of tits in your hands will override any loyalty you have to Anna. Ryan, you just have to face it. Your engagement is over. Now that you've seen what I have to offer, you can't go back to ugly, flat Anna, can you?" 

 How could she think that? How could she think that a glimpse of her body would be enough to end his marriage? Sure she was hot, but she was clearly such a slut. She has probably been with lots of guys. With a body like hers, it would be impossible for her not to get laid on a consistent basis. She had probably learned all the tricks by this point. She was probably really good at sex. She probably was one hell of a fuck. But the fact that she had put out for tons of guys was something he had never encountered in a woman. Women don't generally advertise how big of a slut they are. Why did she think that would appeal to him? Did she think he was into slutty girls? Did she think that guys wanted sluts? 

 Ryan didn't know that what she was saying was appealing to him on a base level. Her hot body, which seemed to ooze sex, and her voracious sexual nature let it be known that she was a very viable mate. And, by minimizing his fiancée's body in his mind, she was hammering the idea into his head that Anna was not a viable mate. That Anna was not meant to be bred. That Anna was not meant to pass her genes on to the next generation. That Anna's genes were inferior to Alicia's. That Alicia was a more viable mate than Anna. Ryan didn't know that the basis of attraction was whether the person of the opposite sex is viewed as a good mate. And Alicia was clearly a very good mate. So no one could blame Ryan for the fact that his dick was rock hard. And Alicia could sense it. She was such a slut that she could practically smell his hard-on. She sat back down. 

 "Imagine the beautiful babies we would have, Ryan. Better than what your girl could offer. She is inferior to me in every way. We've already established that. I'm better at sex than her. We both know that. I'm more attractive than her. Plus, I'm smarter than her. Even though she's going to be a fancy lawyer, she's an idiot where it counts. And because of that, a stupid waitress is on a date with her man." Alicia argued. 

 Ryan had to admit he had underestimated Alicia's intelligence. Alicia was a driven, ambitious, motivated slut. She worked hard to get into this situation. She worked hard to get Ryan alone. She had outsmarted Anna, and manipulated both of them into making the situation suit her 

 "An idiot waitress has outsmarted your girl to the point where her man is starting to fall hard for some skanky waitress." Alicia said. 

 "What makes you say that?" Ryan inquired nervously. He let out an oof as her foot reached under the table and pressed into his throbbing erection. She gave him a knowing stare, knowing that she had him wrapped around her finger. She started to massage his throbbing dick with her bare foot. He groaned out loud. 

 "So you have to ask yourself: Why are you tying yourself down to a sinking ship? Why are you with a woman who is inferior in all the ways that matter? When you hook up with me, everyone will understand you traded up. Heck, I've become friends with all of Anna's friends. And guess what? They stopped hanging out with her because they all like me better. They like me because they actually can meet men when around me. With her, they get nothing. You're not alone in preferring me. Anna's friends, people who you like and respect, like me better. So don't be afraid, Ryan. Admit you've been in love with me ever since you met me. Admit that it was love at first sight. Admit that you want to dump her and hook up with me. Admit that you had to stop yourself from proposing to me that night in the restaurant. Admit it." she said, her foot still rubbing his dick so well. 

 Ryan thought about this logically. Alicia was hotter than Anna. Alicia was sexier than Anna. Alicia had a better body than Anna. Alicia had outsmarted Anna, so she had displayed some superior intelligence. Alicia was superior to Anna in every way. He had to ask himself, why was he still with Anna? What was holding him to her? Was it loyalty? What if he was making a mistake? What if he was loyal to her simply because she was his first? Ryan realized the choice was all his. He could choose to leave Anna for Alicia. He realized that was a possible outcome. He could do that. His body was clearly reacting to Alicia. His body wanted Alicia. His hard dick wanted Alicia. His cock wanted to be inside Alicia. His cock wanted to shoot the massive load of cum that was building in his balls deep inside Alicia. His dick wanted to breed with Alicia. 

 Could he do that to Anna? Could he dump her in such a vicious way? Why was that not sounding so bad right now? Why was he more open to that possibility now? It couldn't be because of her huge tits and filthy mouth, could it? 

 "I don't love you." he said, putting up a last plea. 

 "Yes you do. Just think what an outsider would say. You gave me a huge tip at the restaurant, equal to the bill. You friended me immediately after meeting me. You texted with me, and chatted me up on the phone. Anyone would say that you wanted to hook up with me." Alicia said. Ryan knew there were extenuating circumstances with those things, but he couldn't find the words. Her foot on his dick was too distracting. 

 "You don't even know the things I would do to you. I would destroy your dick. In bed, I do it all. Not like her, who just lies there, right? I know you wish your sex life was better. This is your chance. You think hot sluts like me would throw themselves at you all the time? This is your chance to improve your life. Take it!" Alicia said. She removed her foot from his dick. Before he could recover, she was kneeling at his side. She put her hand on his dick and proceeded to stroke it through his pants. He groaned as she did this. 

 Alicia was right. He might never get this chance again. Could he possibly just fuck her once, just to get it out of the way? Could he experiment, and get some pussy on the side, just to make sure he was not making a mistake with Anna? Could he fuck her just to make sure he knew what was out there? He might have to, just to reaffirm that he was making the right decision with Anna. He might have to fuck Alicia to make his impending marriage to Anna stronger? Could he do that? Could he cheat on Anna just this once? No, he couldn't. It would be cheating. He couldn't become a cheater. He had to fight. He had to stay loyal to Anna. He had to be a good person. 

 "It feels so good, doesn't it? It's okay. Just let go. I'll take care of you." she whispered in his ear. She kept at it, teasing him to the point of insanity without letting him go over. His eyes were drawn to the valley of juicy cleavage she was exposing for him. That soft-looking cleavage took the fight out of him. He rested his head on her shoulder as he let her stroke him. Finally, she released his dick and moved to sit on the table in front of him. Their dinner was long finished, so she shoved the empty bowl off the table, sending it crashing to the floor. She replaced the spot the plate occupied with her butt. Sitting in front of him, she flipped her dress over her crotch, revealing her thong-clad pussy to his leering eyes. She reached down and swiftly pulled the thong to the side, exposing her bare pussy to him. 

 "You made dinner. I brought dessert" she said, eager to take this date to the next level. Eager to turn this into a fuck-date. She reached forward and grabbed his head. He couldn't do it, could he? Could he eat this slut's pussy? If he did that, it was a slippery slope to full-on sex. If he ate out her pussy, this would end with them in a sweaty tangle of limbs, their sticky naked bodies pressed against each other as they fucked. Ryan had to admit this slut was affecting him. She was extremely sexy, and her body was out of this world. What she had said earlier was correct: she was made to be bred. But she was also a psychotic stalker. 

 Ryan knew he had to fight back. He had to take all the loyalty he had for his future wife and resist this evil bitch from having her way with him. All the loyalty he had towards Anna would provide the strength he needed to prevent this bitch from pulling him face-first into her pussy. He geared himself up for Alicia's onslaught as Alicia started to pull on his head. With all the loyalty he had towards Anna, he tried to resist her attack. 

 Would Ryan be able to prevent Alicia from pulling him into her pussy? Would his loyalty and love for Anna, his fiancée, be enough to stop Alicia? 

 Alicia was able to easily pull his face towards her waiting pussy. She expected more of a fight, but Ryan didn't put up much of one as she mashed her pussy against his mouth. At first, he was content to simply let his mouth press up against her pussy. But she would not be satisfied with that. She ground her cunt violently against his face, smearing her juices all over her face. Faced with no other choice, he proceeded to start eating her out. 

 Ryan's tongue leapt out of his mouth and into her pussy. His tongue dug deep into her pussy, collecting her copious juices. His face was pressed hard against her, so his nose was pressed against her clit. He sucked hard on her pussy, trying to draw her juices into his mouth. Alicia moaned, which echoed throughout the house. 

 Ryan had thought he was so much smarter than this waitress. He thought he had nothing to fear from her. But there he was, eating her pussy on the dinner table. That waitress had established herself as the top dog here. And now she was reaping the rewards, having this engaged man between her legs, vigorously eating her pussy. 

 He ran his tongue up her soft pussy lips, enjoying the sensation. He could tell she was close by her hardened clit, which was pointing skyward, begging to be sucked on. Ryan couldn't resist as he wrapped his lips around it and started to suck. She yelled out loud and wrapped her legs around his head firmly. 

 "What a good boyfriend you are!" Alicia yelled out, her voice warbling and her thighs quivering as an orgasm ripped through her body. Her juices spilled into the engaged man's mouth in copious amounts. For a fleeting moment he feared he would drown. He had no choice but to swallow every drop. She finally released his head from her thighs as she came down from her orgasm. Ryan sat back in his seat, regaining his breath. 

 What had he done? He had eaten this bitch's pussy. He had made Alicia cum. He licked his lips at the thought, collecting the remnants from her twat. He watched as Alicia readjusted herself, covering her pussy again with her skirt. She looked down at him smugly. 

 "I can't do this." Ryan said. 

 "Quit fighting it, Ryan. You know you want me. You know what's going to happen." Alicia said. 

 "Anna..." Ryan started, his head in his hands. 

 "Isn't here for you. I am here. I always will be." Alicia said, her eyes glassed over in lust. Ryan looked up into her eyes. 

 "Wanna know a secret?" she whispered. She took his non response as a yes. 

 "Did you know that the air in a woman's cleavage smells extra sweet? When a man takes a whiff, it'll drive him wild with lust. So wild that he can't control himself." she said. He raised his eyebrow questioningly. She reached over and grabbed each side of his head with her hands. 

 "Here, take a whiff." she says, pulling his head into her chest. He was caught off guard, but his shock did not last. It was hard to stay shocked when you're nose-deep in a massive pair of breasts. Ryan didn't fight Alicia. He just took it. He just sat there and let this slut with the huge boobs do what she wanted to him. He let he scrub her tits across his face. He closed his eyes as she smothered him. The softness surrounding his face was an incredible sensation. He could feel her hard nipples rubbing across his cheeks. He couldn't breathe through his mouth, so the only way he could get air into his lungs was through his nose. As he breathed deeply, he realized Alicia was telling the truth. The air in her cleavage smelled great! 

 Ryan was lost in her cleavage for what felt like an eternity. He felt like he could fall in there and get lost forever. She just pressed his face tightly into her soft breasts before finally releasing him. He gasped for air, but the smell of her cleavage was not going away. The smell was driving him mad with lust. He started to violently shake his face between her breasts, wanting to be fully covered in their softness. Alicia's breasts had driven him to this point, the point where his body and mind were reduced to their basest of levels. That was why Ryan didn't put up a fight when Alicia grabbed his hand and led him upstairs towards the bedroom.

********** 

 Anna drove home in a great mood. The more she thought about her upcoming marriage, the more excited she got. She couldn't wait to be married to Ryan and start a family with him. They had talked about having kids, and she had explained that she wanted to wait while their careers grew. But she wanted kids. She wanted lots of them. She couldn't wait to start a family. She couldn't wait to be a mom. 

 The flashing lights of a police car brought her out of her revere. 

 "Fuck!" she yelled to herself as she saw the flashing red and blue lights of the cop car now following her. She pulled to the side of the road. She pulled out her license and registration and waited for the cop to approach. She heard the knock on the window and rolled it down. She looked up at the cop hoping to use her womanly charm on him, but was disappointed to see a female cop looking down at her. And not just any female cop. A female cop with a very distinctive set of tits. A distinctively beautiful face. A distinctively perfect body. 

 "Hi." Anna said, trying to make sure the cop recognized her. 

 "License and registration." Officer Rivera said, not acknowledging the fact that she knew Anna. Anna handed her info to the cop, who walked back to her cruiser. Anna was happy to see a familiar face. She was hoping this would get taken care of quickly. Anna shook her head again at this cop's perfect body. She usually thought of female cops as being a bit butch, but this one defied the stereotype. The cop returned quickly. 

 "Miss Franklin, I'm afraid I can't let you go any further. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around." Veronica said. 

 "What? Why?" Anna asked, confused. 

 "I'm afraid that you would be violating the terms of your restraining order if you were to proceed any further." the cop said. 

 "What do you mean? My house is that way." Anna said. 

 "I know. But I'm afraid there is someone else there, and if you were to go there, you would be violating your restraining order." Veronica said. 

 "What are you saying? Why would she be at my house?" Anna said, still confused. 

 "From what she told me, she was on a date." the cop said. 

 "What do you mean, a date? Why would she be on a date in my house?" Anna said. Veronica gave her a look that said the answer should be obvious. 

 "Oh, bullshit! There is not a chance that Ryan is on a date with her!" Anna said fiercely. 

 "She told me that he had asked her on a date. She suspected you might show up, which is why she asked me to be here." Veronica said. The pieces started to fall into place. Anna started to realize that this cop was talking to Alicia. This cop was friends with Alicia. They were in on this together. 

 "Are you friends with that bitch?" Anna asked. 

 "Yes. We happen to be friends. I owe her a favor, so I'm repaying it." the cop said. 

 "This is bullshit. Is this some game you guys cooked up just to fuck with me?" Anna said, starting her car. "I'm going home." 

 "Ma'am, if you move forward, I will arrest you." Veronica said fiercely, fingering her gun. 

 "That's my house! And that bitch is not there!" Anna said. 

 "Ma'am, the only way you could go home is if I escort you there. If you allow me to take you there, I can prove that Alicia is there, which would show that you would be in violation of your restraining order if you were to go alone." Veronica said. "If you don't, I will arrest you and take you to jail." 

 Anna looked livid, but she didn't have a choice. 

 "If you're lying to me, I'll have your badge." Anna threatened. Veronica opened the door. 

 "Why do I have to get out of my car?" Anna asked. 

 "The only way you're going home is if you ride with me." Veronica said. 

 "I can't just leave my car here." Anna said. Her parents had bought her this car for graduation. She loved it. 

 "Don't worry. This is a safe neighborhood." Veronica said. Anna grumpily stood up out of the car. She locked the doors as the cop watched her. 

 "If this is just some game, I will have your badge. I know my man would never let that bitch in my house. When I'm proven right, you're done. I'm a lawyer, you know." Anna said smugly. 

 "Do I look worried?" Veronica said with a smile. Anna looked at her with pure hate. The cop turned and started walking to her car. Anna couldn't help but notice her butt shaking as she walked. Anna was confident in Ryan. She had no doubts in his fidelity, and once she was proven right, then that slutty waitress and this bitch cop were done. 

 The cop opened the back door of the car. 

 "Really?" Anna asked, annoyed at being treated like a criminal. Veronica simply smiled. Anna sat in the backseat in a huff. The cop quickly entered the driver's seat. Anna had trouble remembering Veronica's full name. 

 "I want your name and badge number. My friends will be more than happy to take a bitch like you down." Anna said. The cop looked over her shoulder and smiled before she spoke. 

 "Badge number 6991. Officer Veronica Rivera. Don't you forget it." 

 ********* 

 Alicia pushed Ryan into the bedroom, and when he turned to face her, she kicked the door shut and jumped into his arms. On reflex, he grabbed her legs and held her up as she wrapped her long legs around him. She brought her mouth to his, and before he had a chance to react, her tongue was in his mouth. Her tongue mashed against his as the French-kiss began. The sensation of her soft, pouty lips against his felt so good. He was so lost in the pleasure that he let Alicia force him to fall back onto the bed. Their mouths remained connected as neither wanted the kiss to end. 

 Alicia was such a good kisser. Her tongue was everywhere in his mouth, and her lips were so soft. After a few minutes of making out, Alicia pulled away. His mouth was blindly searching for hers, but she was controlling the situation, and she knew she was about to take this to the next level. She unbuttoned his nice dress shirt and ripped it off of him, revealing his fit chest as she sucked on it. She took in his chest with her hands, admiring his muscles. Her mouth trailed downward towards his abdomen. As she kissed her way down his abs, her hands reached his belt-buckle and opened it. She then unbuttoned his pants and pulled down the zipper. 

 Ryan knew what was about to happen and he had a moments clarity. How had this slut lured him into bed? Then he looked down at her, and saw her huge tits bursting out of her dress, and saw the things it took to lure him to this point. They were so soft, yet so massive. He had to have them. All thoughts of putting up a fight were swiftly stopped when Alicia lifted up his boxer-briefs and pulled them down, finally revealing his large dick to the waitress's eyes. 

 "Oh, wow!" she said softly as she hovered above it, in awe of his hefty, ten- inch dick. She wrapped her hand around it and started to stroke it gently. 

 "Why have you been hiding this from me? The first time you saw me, you should have taken me aside and showed it to me. When you saw me, and you realized how hot I am..." As she said this, she gave his hard dick a firm squeeze. "How sexy I am." Squeeze. "How gorgeous I am." Squeeze. "How big my tits are." Squeeze. "How long my legs are." Squeeze. "How round my ass is." Squeeze. "When you realized how unbelievably gorgeous I am, you should have done what a real man would do. You should have dumped your girlfriend, taken me aside, and shown me that huge fucking dick. Because you know a slut like me deserves it. You know a slut like me deserves the best." 

 With that, she leaned forward, and gave the tip of his cock a juicy kiss. Ryan groaned out loud as he felt her soft lips against the tip of his penis. He looked down as she pulled her lips away and saw some pre-cum stretch between her mouth and his dick. She finally leaned forward, mouth open, and simply inhaled his ten-inch shaft to the balls. 

 "Oh, fuck!" Ryan yelled out, vocalizing the pleasure he felt as this slutty waitress took his dick in her warm, wet mouth down to the balls. He looked down at her, and her eyes flashed at him as he looked into them. She looked so fucking good with a dick in her mouth. She looked down at his cock, putting all of her focus on it. She proceeded to bob upward, leaving just the tip in her mouth. Ryan was shocked to see his prick covered in this slut's saliva. She proceeded to go back down, taking his entire cock in her mouth, before bobbing back up. She repeated this process for a few minutes. Her saliva was dripping down his dick, soaking his balls. She eventually started to focus on the top half of his dick, really going to town. Her tongue was everywhere, and the image of her soft lips against his cock was nearly enough to drive him over the edge. She sensed this so she pulled away, with her drool connecting her mouth and his dick. She wrapped her fingers around the root of his dick, preventing his explosion. 

 "Uh, uh baby. It's not gonna be that easy." she said, wiping the drool from her mouth. Once she let the cum simmer in Ryan's balls, she leaned back down and started to run her tongue up and down the sides of his meaty shaft. Her tongue felt amazing on his cock. She was doing things to his dick that he had never felt before. Things that he didn't know could be done to a penis. Things that Anna didn't know how to do. Alicia then took his balls in his mouth, one at a time, gently sucking on them. Then she ran her tongue up the underside of his dick before settling at the tip, gently flicking at it. 

 "Just look at the size of the tip." she said, admiring his large cock-head. "It's almost as big a tip as the one you gave me at the restaurant." she added with a wicked laugh. She gave the tip of his cock one last kiss before pulling away. She stood up and grabbed his shoes and pants and pulled them off, leaving him nude on the bed in front of the still clothed waitress. 

 "God, I really need to get this dress off, don't you think?" she asked rhetorically, knowing how desperate he was to see her body in the flesh. He could only nod, so turned on at this point that he would do anything at this point to see her hot body. As he looked at her, he couldn't help but marvel at how she was able to pack the bulbous parts of her body into that tight dress. The dress was stretched thin, molding along her trim waist and stomach. That made it more unbelievable to see her huge tits packed snugly in the dress, the chest area stretched to the breaking point under the weight of those massive titties. And her ass, so round and firm, was a true bubble butt. And seeing that dress molded to her perfect ass like a second skin was enough to drive any man wild. He body was truly bursting to be free from under that dress. 

 "I should warn you that once you see this." she said, gesturing toward her body, "Once you see me in the buff, you won't settle for anything less. You won't settle for anything less than the best. So, if I let you see the goods, I have to be sure you're with me for the long haul." 

 "You need to understand that once you see me naked, you're gonna feel the unbelievable urge to dump your fiancée and shack up with me. Once you see this body, you will start to realize that your fiancée is less of a woman where it counts. And once you realize that, you will have no choice but to jump into bed with me. Once you see me nude, you will have the incredible urge to put a ring on my finger. You need to understand the consequences of what will happen if you see my body in the flesh. So I want you be sure when you answer this question: Do you want me to take off this dress?" Alicia asked. 

 Ryan figured what she was saying was bullshit. Her body couldn't be that life- changing, could it? Ryan justified this situation to himself, and figured he could get just one cheat out of his system before committing fully to Anna. He wasn't married yet, he told himself. At this point, he just had to see that body of hers just one time, then he could get her out of his life for good. 

 "Yes! I want you to take your dress off. I want to see your hot fucking body." he said. 

 "And you'll dump the fiancée once I do, right?" Alicia asked, running her fingers under the straps of the dress. 

 "Yes!" Ryan replied, telling her what she wanted to hear. Alicia smiled wickedly. 

 Alicia turned around and looked over her shoulder wildly. She reached under the straps again and slipped them off her shoulders. Since the dress was so tight, there was no chance it would fall to the floor. It had to be pulled off. From Ryan's viewpoint, he could see her sexy naked back appear as Alicia lowered the dress. It took a little bit of effort to pull the dress past her large boobs, but Alicia was able to use a little force pull the gown down to her waist. This motion caused her tits to jiggle, and since they were so big, Ryan could see the jiggling even from behind her. She had an incredible amount of sideboob to tantalize him with. She smiled at him again as she saw how transfixed he was by her body. She then started to shake her booty as she started to pull the dress down over her ass. Her ass crack started to appear, framed by the twin globes of her round, tan ass cheeks. Slowly, almost teasingly slow, Alicia lowered the dress and the thong under it, revealing her ass to Ryan's leering eyes. She finally got past the widest point of her ass, and once she did, the rest of the trip was easy. She let the top edge of the dress hover just under her ass, revealing her gorgeous, bare ass for the first time to her new lover. She stopped there before letting the dress drop to the floor. Alicia was now completely nude. He had seen her pussy downstairs, and sucked on it, and as she bent over to show off her bare ass, he could see a hint of it again. But there was one part of her he hadn't seen. One thing he was desperate to see. Well, two things, technically. Two big, fat, round things, that were tantalizingly just out of sight. She turned around, but Ryan was disappointed to see her right arm covering her breasts. They were bulging around her arms and hands. He looked at her hand that was now palming her left breast, and if he looked close, he could see just a hint of nipple through her fingers. 

 "God, this room needs a stripper pole. If it had one, I could dance for you and really tease you some more with these. You should get one." She suggested. She started to dance, shaking her hips slowly, seductively, but always keeping her hand over her breasts. She turned around again, facing away from him, and only then did she remove her arm from her chest. She held her hands behind her head as she shook her ass, tantalizing the soon to be married man. She started to work up a sweat as she danced, and she turned around again, but as she did so, she replaced her arm back over her breasts. 

 "Oh, c'mon!" Ryan yelled out. Alicia smiled wickedly, knowing how nuts she was driving him. 

 "Do you want to see these?" she asked teasingly. 

 "Yes!" Ryan begged. 

 "You want to see my huge titties?" Alicia said. 

 "Yes! Please, I need to see them!" he begged again. 

 "Would you do anything for them? Would you break off your engagement just to see my big boobs?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yes! I'll do whatever you want!" Ryan said, telling her what she needed to hear. Then she looked right at him. Right into his eyes. And then she spread her arms out and thrust her chest forward, revealing her breasts to the engaged man. 

 "Holy shit." Ryan whispered. They were even bigger than he thought. They had to be an EE cup, maybe even bigger. They were just huge. They were fucking huge, and fucking firm, and fucking round. Just fucking perfect. They rode high on her chest, with shockingly little sag. They were so naturally round and rode so close together that they formed a perfect line of natural cleavage. And those nipples were round, and hard, begging to be sucked on. Aching for a mouth to surround them and pleasure her. Ryan had always been a tit man, which raised the question of why he would marry a girl who could barely fill up an A-cup bra, like Anna. He thought he could live without having a pair of big tits in his life, but Alicia was beginning to convince him otherwise. Alicia started to slink towards the bed. 

 "I hope you just realized your engagement is off. Might as well call it off. Call your family. Let them know that plans have changed. You're marrying a new girl now. People will be shocked, but when they see me, they'll understand. They'll see how fucking sexy I am, and they'll see how huge my tits are, and they'll know. They'll see what truly matters with a guy like you. You were all engaged and set to marry your true love, but then you met a girl with huge tits and that changed everything. You decided to marry her instead, and get lifetime access to these suckers. They will all understand, because you are a man, and you took what any man would. Your family and friends will love me, because quite frankly, who doesn't love and respect a girl with huge tits? Soon, your little fiancée will be left in the dust, and all your friends family will start to forget your little girlfriend's name. What was it again? Abigail? Alice?" she said wickedly, crawling onto the bed, her tits swinging slightly as she crawled. Ryan reached upward to grab them, but she grabbed his hands and forced them to the bed. She straddled him and sat on his stomach, knocking the wind out of him for a second. She could feel his hard cock drag along her right butt cheek, leaving a trail of pre-cum behind. She rested one hand on his chest and then leaned up and reached below her, grabbing his dick and pointing towards her sweet little pussy. She rubbed it against the outside of her pussy, teasing Ryan, before finally placing the tip of his dick against the entrance of her cunt. She started to sit down, lowering herself onto Ryan's huge dick. 

 "FUCK!" Ryan yelled out as the head of his dick entered her cunt. 

 "Oh shit." Alicia moaned softly, her tight cunt stretching around the head. Her weight lowered onto Ryan, forcing his cock deep into this slut's tight little cunt. Soon, Alicia was resting on his lap, her ass sitting above his balls, his dick buried to the root in this slutty waitress. They just sat there and took in the pleasure they were feeling. They took in the pleasures that only a huge dick in a tight cunt could provide. She flexed her tight pussy around his cock, almost milking it with her spectacular cunt. 

 For Ryan, being balls deep in such a tight cunt was a new experience. Anna was not even this tight, and she had only been with Ryan. But how can this slut have an even tighter pussy? She obviously fucks around, but how does she keep her cunt so tight? It must be naturally tight. This girl truly was meant for one thing: she was meant to be fucked. She was meant to be on her back with her ankles on some lucky guy's shoulders as he pounded away at her. She was built to be so sexy that guys would be desperate to cum in her. She was built to be bred. She was meant to have pregnant belly. She was meant to be a mommy. 

 As Alicia's tight pussy was milking his dick, he couldn't help but compare Alicia to Anna. Anna was many things, but few would consider her built to be bred. Her body was unspectacular, with her tiny titties, and bony ass. She wasn't spectacularly pretty. She was cute, but she didn't compare to Alicia. And Alicia had made a good point. He was starting to think that Anna didn't want kids. The more he thought about it, the more it made sense to him. 

 Alicia was superior in every way. The only drawback Ryan had come up with for Alicia was her intelligence. Anna was a lawyer, and Alicia was destined to be a lifelong waitress. Ryan had not had any respect for Alicia's intelligence or her work ethic. But then Alicia's seduction had begun. And she had swiftly wormed her way in between the engaged couple and systematically split them up and isolated Ryan as her target. She had worked hard, day after day, to prove herself to Ryan. But Ryan, a future big-shot doctor, and Anna, a future big- shot lawyer, both had looked down at Alicia. But Alicia had easily outsmarted and outwitted them both, and her prize was the stud of a man below her. Ryan now knew that Alicia was smarter, hotter, sexier, more fuckable, and better breeding material than his fiancée. While his fiancée was serious and career focused, Alicia was happy and full of life. She provided a sense of excitement and craziness that Anna could never provide. It was at this point that Ryan's love for his fiancée Anna had started to fade. And the spark of a new love had started to grow. Ryan was starting to fall in love with the buxom, slutty waitress sitting on his dick. Alicia looked smugly down at her new man, knowing she had won. With that, she started to bounce.  

 

 

===

"Oh, fuck!" Ryan yelled, the pleasure her pussy was providing was too great. He knew he wouldn't last too long. She was too fucking hot. But he would try his best. He would give this slut his best. 

 He grabbed her hips and assisted her in making this fuck as hard as possible. They started to work up a sweat with the only goal of getting each other off. As Ryan saw those massive breasts bouncing, he couldn't resist any longer. He reached up and palmed those massive titties. 

 "Holy shit!" he said, remarking at how perfect her tits felt in his hands. He cupped her tits and tweaked her nipples as she rode him hard. 

 "Can Anna do this? Can she make you feel so good? Can she make the cum boil in your balls like I do?" Alicia asked, panting. 

 "No she doesn't. She's not as good as you are." Ryan called out to the slut furiously riding him. He had never been ridden this hard. He had never been ridden. Anna was a missionary type of girl. Ryan's words caused her to laugh. 

 "Tell me that you love me. Tell me when you first fell in love with me." Alicia begged, needing to hear him confess his love before she came. 

 "I love you! I always loved you! I fell in love with you the first time I saw your tits bouncing in that restaurant! I fell in love with you the moment you shook your butt at me!" Ryan yelled, hoping the neighbors would hear. 

 "FUCKING SHIT, IT FEELS SO FUCKING GOOD!!" Alicia called out, burying his dick inside her as her pussy flexed in waves as she started to cum, grinding against him. 

 "OH SHIT, I LOVE YOU!" Ryan screamed, cumming harder than he ever had before, spilling his cum deep into the womb of this slutty waitress. They ground into each other as they rode out their almost painful orgasms. He squeezed her tits hard, finding the softness in his hands increased the pleasure he felt in his balls. They rode out their orgasms for over a minute before she fell off of him, out of breath. She settled on Anna's side of the bed, lying on her back as she caught her breath. She could feel Ryan's load deep inside her. Ryan looked over at her, this slut replacing his fiancée in their bed. He couldn't help but think, she looked like she belonged there. 

 Alicia belonged in Ryan's bed. 

 ********** 

 "So you're friends with this bitch, Alicia, right?" Anna asked to the cop driving in the front seat. 

 "Yes, we are great friends." Veronica said. "We have been for years." 

 "So this is some big plan you guys cooked up, so she could steal my man." Anna asked. 

 "I can't take credit. This was all her. She is so fucking smart." Veronica said. 

 "You know she's a huge slut, right? You know she's a stalking psycho?" Anna said. 

 "Well, she's not a psycho, but she definitely is a slut. I have learned so much from her." Veronica said. 

 "So you're a slut too?" Anna asked with venom. 

 "Absolutely. She taught me everything I needed to know." Veronica said. 

 Anna just shook her head, realizing she was in the presence of a huge slut. Sluts disgusted her. 

 "That's your problem, Anna. Right there. You don't respect sluts. You really should, because they're superior to girls like you in every way." Veronica said. 

 "Ha! Sluts are superior. Bullshit!" Anna said, acting superior. 

 "You may not think so, but guess who does? Men. Men love sluts even though they would never admit it to girls like you. Guys love skanky girls with big tits, perfect asses, and who put out like crazy." Veronica said. 

 "Bullshit!" Anna said. 

 "Well, I get laid like crazy, and so does Alicia. Believe me, she is very good at what she does. You should show her some respect." Veronica said. 

 "I told you, I don't respect sluts. And neither does Ryan." Anna said. 

 "You think so?" she asked. 

 "Of course. Ryan's a good man. He would never cheat. He wouldn't be tricked by some stupid slut like her." Anna said. 

 "Well, I'll guess we'll see who's right." Veronica said with a smile. "I'll make you a deal, Anna. If you're right, I'll quit the force today." 

 Anna thought this over. This was a no-lose situation. 

 "Fine. Deal. I look forward to seeing you on street, jobless." Anna said smugly. 

 "And I look forward to seeing your fiancé fucking a stupid, slutty waitress." Veronica said with a smile. 

 Anna was confident, almost smug, as she knew her fiancé would never cheat. 

 ********** 

 Alicia had left the bed, which confused Ryan. She returned, still nude, her tits bouncing, with a box in hand. It was the same box she had brought into the house earlier. 

 "What's in the box?" Ryan asked, still lying nude on the bed, his dick still slightly hard. He knew they were not done yet. 

 "Well, I figured since I knew how true our love was, I knew that you would realize it as well. So, I brought some of my stuff. I figured if I'm gonna be moving in with you, I can at least get a drawer to start. Don't worry, I only brought the essentials." Alicia said. She opened the box, and pulled out a ball of lace. "I brought some thongs." She said, holding a skimpy red thong and a skimpy baby-blue thong in her hands. She threw them back in the box and grabbed some other stuff. "Some bras." She said, holding up a red bra in her hands. The size of the bra cups made him shudder. "I also brought some other lingerie. You know, the essentials." Alicia said brightly. 

 She opened up a drawer, which happened to be Anna's underwear drawer. 

 "Eww, yuck! Look at these gross, granny panties. Well, we can throw these out." Alicia said, pulling out plain underwear, before tossing them on the floor. She reached in and pulled out some of Anna's sexier lingerie, a pink lace number, which Ryan had bought for her for their anniversary the previous year. This made Alicia laugh. 

 "Why would she bother? Why bother getting sexy lingerie with a body like hers? Why get a sexy bra for her A-cup's? Why would she get a thong for her bony ass?" Alicia said. She was about to toss them on the floor when she got an idea. She looked to Ryan, with lust in her eyes. 

 "I have an idea..." she told him. 

 ********** 

 Veronica pulled into the driveway of Ryan and Anna's house. 

 "See, no car here. No car, no slut." Anna said confidently. Veronica smiled, with this stupid bitch not knowing that she had dropped Alicia off for the date. Veronica turned off the car and got out. She opened the back door, letting Anna out. 

 "Follow me." Veronica said confidently. She shook her round ass as she walked, which disgusted Anna. 

 "So, did you really investigate her?" Anna asked. 

 "I didn't have to. I know she did it." Veronica said with a smile. 

 "So, what did you do with the evidence?" Anna asked. Veronica turned and smiled. 

 "Hun, I threw it all away the first chance I could. And you, you stupid fucking bitch, you let it happen. You gave all the evidence to me, and the only evidence you had left you washed away." Veronica said. 

 "I knew it. I knew stupid cops like you don't take care of the evidence at the crime scene." Anna said. 

 "But you were too scared to do anything about it. You were too intimidated by me to fight back. That's why you will lose. You realize, if you had fought back, Alicia would be in jail right now. But no. You did nothing. You were too afraid, so you let this happen." Veronica said. 

 They reached the front door, and Veronica reached down to open it. Anna was surprised to see the door open, as they usually kept the door locked. They stepped inside and shut the door. 

 Things were quiet for a second before they started to hear a creaking from above them. Veronica smiled as she watched Anna's face drop with fear. Anna pushed past Veronica and sprinted up the stairs. Veronica calmly followed. 

 Anna sprinted to the bedroom door where the noise was coming from. She opened it, and her mouth dropped in shock. 

 On the bed, that she and Ryan shared, Ryan was now sharing it with another woman. And that woman was that bitch, Alicia... Alicia, that skanky, slutty waitress, was bouncing on Ryan's hard cock. But Alicia wasn't naked. She was wearing Anna's favorite set of underwear, the set that Ryan had bought for her for their anniversary. The pink thong was clinging to Alicia, since her ass was much rounder and fuller than Anna's. It was pushed slightly to the side to allow Ryan's hard cock inside her. And Alicia was wearing Anna's bra, which was stretched to the max by her massive tits. The bra was digging into her tits, and her tits were bulging around the edges of the bra, begging to be free from under the small-cupped bra. It looked like the bra would disintegrate under the force Alicia's big titties, their massive size exerting against it. Alicia's tits were overwhelming the bra as she bounced. 

 "Fuck me lover! Fuck me! Put a baby in my belly. Please!" Alicia begged, nearly out of breath as she bounced roughly on Ryan's hard cock. The furious fuck continued, as Ryan drove up into this slut. 

 "No. No." Anna sobbed, tears forming in her eyes. She blinked, hoping her eyes were somehow tricking her. She saw the two lovers pace pick up, knowing they were soon reaching their climax. 

 "Ryan, don't!" she yelled at her fiancé, hoping that he wouldn't cum in this whore. But Ryan gave no indication that he even heard her. Her boyfriend ignored her and continued to fuck this whore. Anna just watched, frozen to the spot, as she watched this whore fuck the shit out of her man. As Alicia got closer to her orgasm, she bounced harder and harder. So hard it had to be hurting Ryan. But he didn't care. All he cared about was the pleasure this whore was bringing him. As Alicia bounced so hard, and her tits bounced with her, it was inevitable how it would end. 

 Anna's bra burst open, no longer able to cope with the strain Alicia's tits were placing on it. The bra tore to shreds, and the image of Anna's bra ripping was enough to get Ryan and Alicia off. Ryan buried his dick inside of Alicia and shot his cum deep into the pussy of this skank again. Alicia held herself on him as she came on his cock again. 

 And how did Anna react to this? How did she react to seeing her fiancé cum inside Alicia's tight little pussy while watching her favorite bra get torn to shreds by this slut's massive titties? Anna fell to the floor, passing out due to the shock. 

 ********* 

 Anna woke up some time later. She had hoped she was having a nightmare, but as she looked around and took in her surroundings, she realized she was living the nightmare. She looked to the bed and saw Alicia, nude, on all fours. Her tits were resting on Anna's pillow. Her head was up, looking back. Both of her arms were behind her. When Anna saw what Alicia was doing with her hands, she gasped. Both of Alicia's hands were reaching behind her, holding Ryan's head so his face was buried in her ass. Ryan was smothered in between her round ass- cheeks. Anna didn't even want to know what nasty things her fiancé was doing with his mouth against that slut's asshole. They were both clearly enjoying themselves, as Alicia's eyes were lidded over in lust, and Ryan's eyes were closed, clearly putting all of his focus on her slutty asshole. 

 Anna looked at this bitch with pure hate. She hated her smug smirk. She hated her gorgeous face. She hated her huge tits. She hated her rounds ass. She hated her perfect tan skin. Anna hated her slutty nature. She hated how good she looked nude, covered in sweat. She hated everything about her. 

 Anna looked across the room, and saw that bitch cop, Veronica, sitting at her vanity, watching the action. Her pants were off and her top was unbuttoned, revealing a lacy blue bra containing her large breasts. Her hand was in her panties, rubbing her pussy as she watched the illicit couple on the bed. 

 Anna was ready to kill, but as she decided to get up and fight for her man she was pulled back down to the floor by the wrist. She realized that she was cuffed on her right wrist to the dresser post. The dresser was too heavy to lift, so Anna was stuck. She groaned like a wounded animal in anger. 

 She looked back to the bed in time to see Ryan pop his mouth off the whore's asshole. He leaned upward as Alicia balanced on her hands and knees in front of him. Anna watched as her boyfriend settled behind the slut and rested the tip of his dick against her asshole. 

 "Honey, don't..." Anna begged, desperate to see a trace of the man she loved. But there was none. Ryan ignored her, grabbed his slut's hips, and started to force his huge dick up her tight little asshole. As her asshole yielded to the large cock, they both groaned out loud. 

 "Shit, your dick is so fucking big!" Alicia screamed. 

 "Your ass is unbelievable!" Ryan exclaimed. He started to force his dick deeper into the slut's tight ass. Once his dick was buried to the balls, he started to pump his cock in and out of her. 

 "Honey." Anna called out. "Honey, how could you do this?" 

 For the first time, Ryan replied to her. 

 "Have you seen this ass? How could I not fuck it?" he said, before giving Alicia's ass a firm slap. This caused Alicia to groan out loud. 

 "No. How could you betray me? How can you fuck this slut? How could you throw away what we had?" Anna asked. 

 Alicia had awoken the deep-seeded resentment Ryan had for Anna. He looked at his fiancée, the dislike he held for her now visible. 

 "How come you never fucked me like this? I needed to be fucked like this, but you never loved me enough to do so? How did you expect to hold onto a man that way? And more importantly, how do you expect to have a man love you if you have no tits?" Ryan said, leaning down and cupping Alicia's massive breasts, giving them a healthy squeeze. 

 "I thought you liked when we made love? I thought you were always happy with me and my body?" Anna said, crying. 

 "Well, clearly, you were wrong." he said, continuing to viciously fuck Alicia's ass. "I was never happy. How could you hold me back for so long? How could you prevent me from getting this? How could you let me waste my time with you when there were sluts like her desperate to fuck me?" 

 "How can you say that?" Anna asked, sobbing. But Ryan was past the point of explaining himself. He concentrated on pleasuring his slut and himself. Veronica spoke up. Anna looked over at her. Her tits were now bulging over her bra, exposing her nipples. Ann looked down at Veronica's crotch, and noticed her thong was at her knees, exposing her wet fingers going in and out of her cunt. 

 "Honey, what did I tell you? Men prefer sluts. A girl like you, with a body like that, is always destined to come in last." Veronica said with an arrogant laugh. Anna shook her head, enraged. 

 "Fuck you! Fuck you all!" Anna screamed. They all ignored her. 

 "Oh, the desperate pleas of the small titted girl in a world where big-titted girls are queens." Veronica started, "It's sad really, to be so unaware of how the world works. Don't you realize how everyone looks down at you? Does it sting to realize that men don't want to be with a woman with itty-bitty titties? Does it sting to know that a man would choose a girl with big breasts over a girl with no breasts every time? Does it hurt to realize you were destined to lose? That you were built to be inferior? That the only reason you are here now is to help us big-titted sluts get off?" 

 "Fuck you!" Anna said. 

 "Does it hurt that the only purpose you serve in life is to help sluts like me and Alicia cum? Does it hurt that you are a glorified sex-toy? Does it hurt that you were built to be humiliated? Anna, you are here to be humiliated by big-titted women while they fuck your man. Humiliating you helps sluts like us get off. That's the only thing your good for. That's the only talent you have. And, on behalf of all of us sluts everywhere, I thank you." Veronica said. 

 "Fuck you! It's not true." Anna said, belligerent. 

 "Anna. Get a grip. You need to understand that you're a joke. I mean, look at your tits. Do you realize how hilarious us sluts find teeny-tiny-titted girls? Am I right Alicia?" Veronica asked, stifling a laugh. 

 "Yeah, sweetie. You're right." Alicia panted. "I had to stop myself from laughing when I first saw you. I bet Ryan felt the same way." 

 "When I first met her, I wanted to sneak away because her tits were so small." Ryan said, getting in on the fun of berating Anna. 

 "You want to cum in my ass, don't you?" Alicia panted to Ryan. 

 "Yes. I have wanted to cum in your ass since the moment I met you." Ryan said. 

 "What are you gonna do after you cum in my ass?" Alicia asked. 

 "I'm gonna turn you over, put your ankles on my shoulders, and I'm gonna fuck your pussy again. I'll fuck you again and again until I put a baby in your belly." Ryan said. 

 "No!" Anna yelled out. 

 "Yes! You're gonna give me all your babies, won't you?" Alicia asked. 

 "Yes!" Ryan said. 

 "You're gonna knock me up in front of your fiancée, aren't you?" Alicia asked. The idea of knocking up this slut in front of Anna sent him over the edge. 

 "OH FUCK!" Ryan yelled, burying his dick in all the way before releasing all of his seed up his slut's welcoming ass. He wasn't the only one to scream out, as Veronica finally reached her climax and her juices squirted out of her as she came hard. She fell back, exhausted. 

 Ryan fell to the bed once he finished cumming, but Alicia was not finished as she resumed sucking her new man's cock. She sucked her ass off his dick, until he was back at full hardness again. She lied on her back, ready for Ryan to fulfill his promise. He rolled on top of her, and put her ankles on his shoulders. Ryan fell forward as he started to hammer away at her pussy. 

 All Anna could see was Ryan's pumping ass and Alicia's feet on his shoulders. This fuck went on and on, until Alicia started to speak. 

 "I should thank you, Anna. Thanks for getting Ryan prepared for a real woman. Thanks for prepping him for me. I really appreciate it." she said before laughing. 

 "Fuck off! Fuck you all! Just let me go!" Anna said, desperate to escape this hell. But it was not meant to be. She was forced to watch as the two lovers' fuck session went on and on, neither wanting it to end. Finally, they both groaned out, and Anna was forced to watch as her fiancé's ass clenched as he came inside this slut again. Little did Anna know that she was witnessing the conception of a child. 

 Anna closed her eyes, but she could hear the kisses that Ryan and Alicia were sharing. She could hear them whispering sweet nothings in each other's ears. Veronica's voice tore through the silence. 

 "I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer." Veronica started, "I need a dick up my ass now." 

 Anna looked up to see Veronica stripping off what was left of her clothes, revealing her nude form for all to see. Her perfect body, with her perfect ass, and her perfectly huge, jutting tits. How did these evil sluts get these perfect bodies? What did they do to deserve them? 

 As Veronica joined them on the bed, Alicia started to talk. 

 "Honey, this is another lesson." she said to Ryan. "Sluts are welcome in our bed. I'll let you fuck Veronica, even though you don't know her. You'll do it because I'll tell you to. And Anna's former friends? You can fuck them too. They told me the only reason they stayed friends with her is so they could stay close to you. They wanted to stay within range of that huge dick of yours. So they could stay close enough to fuck." 

 Veronica bent over on all fours in front of Ryan. She turned back and smiled at him, looking wild and gorgeous. He did not hesitate. He placed his dick against her asshole and started to push. She yelled out loud as she felt Ryan's huge dick dig deep up her ass. Ryan held her hips as he buried his dick up the asshole of this woman he didn't know. His head fell back as he groaned out loud in pleasure. He started to pump his dick inside of her welcoming ass. As he fucked her, Alicia got on her knees next to him and started whispering in his ear.  

 

 

===

"You want to know why I chose you?" she started. "The minute I saw you, I could tell you wanted me. I felt the love you had for me. And I felt the same way. And when I saw her, I knew you were gagging to be stolen. I knew that's what you wanted. You desperately wanted some slut to scoop you up, even if you couldn't admit it to yourself. I knew what a mistake you were making, and so I thought I would make your dreams come true. I would show you the good life. You would get all of my love, Ryan. So, I used the ring to get myself off. I stuck it in my pussy, my ass, and between my tits. I stalked you. I followed you and Anna around. I learned about you both. I broke into your house. I got myself off on your bed. I threatened your fiancée. I did it because I knew you were nasty. I knew it would turn you on. I knew you would like all the things I did. And you did, didn't you? I broke the law for you, Ryan? If that's not love, I don't know what is." 

 "Yes, I did. I loved what you did. I loved that you used the engagement ring to get yourself off. I loved that you stalked me. I love that you broke into my house. I love that you sent letters and made fun of my fiancée. I love you." Ryan called out. Anna was shocked at this admission. 

 "There was another reason I stole you, Ryan." Alicia started. "You were hot and I could tell you had a big dick." She added with a laugh. He laughed with her before focusing on the slut in front of him. Her ass was amazing. Veronica's ass was out of this world. He couldn't help himself as he slapped her ass, causing her asshole to tighten around his thrusting cock. She screamed out as he did this. Ryan bent forward, cupped his hands under her massive breasts, grabbed the slut cop's hair, and proceeded to furiously kiss her as he fucked her up the ass. Ryan leaned up, and proceeded to give Alicia the same treatment, pulling her to him, squeezing her tits as they made out. 

 Alicia then sat at the head of the bed, resting her sweaty ass on Ann's pillow. The pillow used for years by Anna to rest her head was now being used for a much better purpose: to soak up the sweat from this slut's perfect ass. Veronica got between Alicia's legs, and proceeded to start eating out Alicia's dripping wet cunt. 

 Ryan was living the dream. He was having a threeway with two gorgeous, big- titted sluts. Two sluts, neither of which he was married to. And those sluts were not afraid of getting down with each other. Ryan knew Veronica's mouth was full of cunt, so her moans were muffled. But Ryan wanted to make this bitch scream. He wanted her screams to wake the neighbors. He started fucking her round, tight ass, harder than he'd ever fucked before. 

 Anna watched as her fiancé fucked this slutty, corrupt cop he barely knew. She looked at Ryan's face, and he was unrecognizable. This man was not her boyfriend anymore. Anna watched as Ryan fucked this bitch at a furious pace before he buried his dick inside her, causing Veronica's to shriek, which nearly burst her eardrums. It's hard for a slut like not to scream in pleasure when getting her ass filled with warm cum. 

 Anna was catatonic as the nasty threeway continued. She had never seen Ryan like this. He was an animal. The last thing Anna remembered seeing was Ryan fucking Alicia doggy-style while Alicia's face was buried in between the warm cheeks of Veronica's ass. Alicia's cheeks were hollowed as she sucked her new man's cum out of the slut cops ass. The fuck went on for hours. Anna passed out to the moans and screams of two slutty girls and her ex-boyfriend. These were sounds that she would never forget. 

 Anna's eyes opened when she was pushed to the ground. Veronica had forced her face down and started grabbing her hand. She ripped the engagement ring off Anna's finger. Anna looked at the bed, and saw Ryan and Alicia standing next to it. Veronica tossed the ring at Ryan. Anna watched in horror as Ryan turned and got down on one knee in front of Alicia. 

 "Alicia, will you marry me?" Ryan asked. He now realized that everything she had said was right. After seeing her body, and fucking her, Ryan knew he had to lock down this little slut. He had to make her his. He had to put a ring on her finger. 

 "Yes! Of course!" Alicia said, bouncing up and down in joy, her huge tits jiggling with her. She held her hand out as Ryan put the ring on her finger. Ryan stood up and kissed his new fiancée. They kissed softly before she pulled back. 

 "I love the ring, but I want you to buy one with a little bit bigger of a rock. I always wanted a huge rock on my finger, and I think I deserve the best." She said like the spoiled brat she was. 

 "Whatever you want, honey." Ryan said before kissing her again. 

 "Nooo!" Anna screamed, but they ignored her. Suddenly, Anna felt her handcuff getting released from the dresser, and she felt the cuff connect to her other hand. 

 "What are you doing?" Anna asked. 

 "Honey, you're under arrest." Veronica said, now fully clothed. 

 "What!" Anna said. 

 "You violated your restraining order, and attempted an assault." Veronica said. 

 "No! You brought me here." Anna argued. 

 "No, that's not how I remember it. You came here and attacked Alicia, but luckily I was close by so I could stop it. You're going to jail." Veronica said. 

 "No! Noooo!" Anna screamed, belligerent. 

 "Wait, one last thing." Alicia said. Alicia walked towards Anna's vanity, grabbing Anna's favorite tube of lipstick. She proceeded to swipe the lipstick on her lips, the lipstick never looking sexier than it did now, on this slut's lips. She walked over to Anna, grabbed her head, and planted a soft kiss on her forehead. As Alicia pulled away, Veronica pointed her at the mirror. Anna looked at her forehead, and saw a familiar set of lip-prints that the kiss left behind. The same set of lip-prints that were on every letter sent to her. 

 "No!" Anna screamed. Alicia happily jumped onto the bed. 

 "C'mon sweetie, let's leave the lovebirds alone." Veronica said, dragging the kicking and screaming woman to her car. Ryan and Alicia didn't even notice. They were too busy making out. They were too much in love to care. 

 ********* 

 Ryan knew he made the right choice. His life improved tremendously after choosing Alicia. He met tons of Alicia's friends, and all of his and Anna's friends ended up staying loyal to him. Anna's friends liked Alicia more, since they all proceeded to meet good men once they started partying with Alicia. And all of Ryan's friends understood why he shacked up with Alicia. Alicia was so ridiculously sexy that Ryan could not be blamed for fucking her. Any one of them would have done the same thing. It took a while for Ryan's family to warm up to Alicia, but they eventually came around. It was like Alicia said; people will like a girl more if she has big tits. Men and women could respect a girl with big tits, and Ryan's family came to eventually respect her and respect the happiness that she brought Ryan. 

 Ryan became a doctor, and was quickly raking in the money. They upgraded to a bigger house, and he was soon able to provide the kind of life Alicia deserved. She had a nice car, a nice house, and she and her husband, Ryan, were working on their third child. Ryan couldn't help but think what a great mommy Alicia was. And their third child would not be their last. She was too damn hot, and she was too good of breeding material to stop at three. Plus, he had gotten addicted to the taste of her breast milk. Fucking Alicia was what Ryan was meant to do. 

 For Anna, her life had been a living hell since having her man stolen from her. That bitch cop, Veronica, had trumped up charges against her, and since the cop had connections with a prosecutor, Anna was put in jail! This ruined her professional career. Law firms didn't want to hire an inexperienced lawyer with a record. Anna couldn't find a job in law no matter how hard she tried. She had lost her man and her livelihood. 

 She dwelled on Ryan for a long time. They were no longer even Facebook friends, but Anna still found herself stalking him nearly every day. She would look at his profile page, and see Ryan and Alicia's marriage posted on it, and how she was his top friend. His best friend. His best friend and his lover. Alicia would annoyingly post all over his wall, but he would eat it up and respond to everything she did. All of his movie and music tastes had changed, now similar to the tastes of that slut Alicia. 

 All of Anna's old friends posted on his wall too. They were closer to Ryan than ever. She would see pictures of Ryan at parties with her old friends. Judging by their closeness in the pictures, Anna could tell they had been lovers. Ryan had become lovers with all of Anna's old friends. He was even friends with that bitch cop, Veronica. She shouldn't be surprised. Rough anal sex creates a closeness between people. 

 Anna would obsess over pictures of the happy couple. Pictures of them at parties, with Alicia naturally wearing slutty outfits. Pictures of Ryan with his friends and Anna's former friends and Alicia, none of them bothered by what he did to his ex-fiancée. The pictures that drove Anna nuts were the mundane ones. The day-to-day pictures of them, enjoying married life. And pictures of their beautiful children. And pictures of their big house. And pictures of Alicia driving Anna's old car, the one she got from her parents. There were a few glimpses of the sexual nature of their relationship, such as the one of Alicia standing proudly next to the stripper pole in their bedroom. These pictures would drive Anna nuts. She just didn't understand how Ryan could fall in love with that slut. 

 She never forgot the venomous words they said to her. The vile humiliation they subjected her too. Their words changed Anna. Anna now had trust issues, and couldn't sustain a relationship with a man. Plus, she had developed a furious hatred for big-titted girls. She knew how evil they could be. She avoided them whenever possible. 

 But the worst indignity was still to come for Anna. Now she had hit rock bottom. She had been in college for eight years, with tons of debt, and now she found herself at a restaurant, waitressing to make ends meet. The only place she could find work at was O'Malley's, the same place she had met Ryan, and the same place he proposed to her. It was also the same place that fucking whore Alicia used to work. Anna was reminded every day of what she had lost. 

 Anna realized that some of the waitresses she worked with were extremely good at waiting tables, and were able to easily make enough money with their salary and the tips. But Anna was not one of those women. Anna had a bad attitude with the customers, and they never gave her much in tips. Why would they? She had a bad attitude, and she wasn't even hot. Why would anyone give her a tip? 

 Anna had rubbed most of her coworkers the wrong way. Anna had an attitude as if she were better than everyone. The only coworker she actually got along with was this girl, Jane. She and Jane had a lot of things in common. 

 Anna told herself this waitressing job was temporary, that she would get a job in law in law eventually. But she didn't know this was where she was destined to be. Anna didn't realize she would be a waitress for life.
