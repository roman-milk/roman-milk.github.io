Postage Stamp
=============
#1 

===

You wouldn't think that something as small and inexpensive as a postage stamp could fuck up a marriage, but one of them, or rather the lack of one of them, did just that. 

I wasn't supposed to be there. There had been an accident at work. Joe Bivens hadn't been paying attention and as a result the turret lathe he had been operating took the little finger off of his left hand and I was elected to take him to the hospital emergency rooms. Once they had Joe in one of the treatment rooms I gave them my cell phone number so they could call me when he was ready to leave and I left. I decided to go home and have lunch while I waited for the call. 

My wife Wendy was at work so I was home alone when the mail came. There were a couple of flyers, the water bill and an envelope with the stamped message from the Post Office on it saying that it could not be delivered without a postage stamp. I didn't recognize the addressee, but it did have our mailing label on the upper left hand corner of the envelope. Wondering just who Brandon Winters was made me just curious enough to open the envelope. 

There have been times since then that I've wished that I hadn't, but then I'd tell myself it was better to find out sooner rather than later. What I read stunned me. 

"My dearest Bran, We have only been seeing each other for a month now and so far it has been the best thirty days of my life. You make me so fucking happy. Whenever I see your face my heart lights up and my tummy gets not just butterflies, but it feels like planes, birds and shooting stars are flying around inside me as well. Every time I look into your eyes I lose myself completely. I'm always thinking about you 24/7. I swear that I've never been this happy with anyone else in my lift. You tore all my pain away and you get my mind off things when I am at my lowest. I've told you all my flaws and yet you still see me as perfect. You make me feel as if I'm actually worth something. You are the light of my life, the other half of my heart and the peace in my mind. I love your eyes and I could just stare into them for days. I can't wait until we have our three day weekend together. I'll be a basket case until it gets here. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and never let you go. You can't even comprehend how much I care for you. Our daily phone conversations and our weekly long lunches at the motel (tee hee) are barely enough to keep me going. 

I love you so much. 

Love Your baby girl Wendy." 

I sat there holding that letter in my hand stunned beyond belief. At first there was confusion at some of her words. "You tore my pain away." What pain? The last thirty days the best of her life? She was either lying through her teeth to this Brandon guy or she was more accomplished at acting than anyone in Hollywood or on the New York stage. I couldn't believe that the last seven years were all an act on Wendy's part. They had been the happiest of my life. The two of us had been happier than two pigs in a large mud puddle. 

It couldn't have been an act on her part. It just couldn't have been. And yet her own words kept leaping up at me from the page. She had been meeting him at motels for long lunches? Why? I'd seen no signs that she was unhappy or dissatisfied with me. No lack of affection at all. 

As I stared at the pages in my hand I did know one thing however. The three day weekend she couldn't wait for? She was not going to enjoy it at all. At least not if I could help it. Supposedly her best friend Joyce had won a three day spa visit for two and she and Wendy were going to go and be pampered. Three days of beauty treatments, massages, mud packs, mud baths or the like. I wondered if Joyce had a lover on the side also or if she was just going to cover for Wendy. No matter. I would probably be having a talk with Harry before that weekend occurred. 

The hardest part for me would be behaving normally around Wendy. I couldn't let her know I had the letter because she would without a doubt call Winters and let him know I was onto them and I couldn't have that. I didn't want Winters to know I'd be coming for him. First order of business was for me to get more information and I knew just who to go to for it. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

I showed up at Carl's Chop House ten minutes before Joyce got off work at four and took a seat in her section. When she showed up with her pad and pen and asked what I'd be having I said: 

"Coffee and a few minutes of your time when you get off work. I have some information that could have an impact on your marriage to Harry and I would like to discuss it with you before talking to Harry." 

She left without a word and then came back with my coffee. She set it down in front of me without a word and left. As I sipped my coffee I wondered what Joyce was going to do. Would she join me once she was off the clock or would she skate out the back door and call Wendy to ask her what was up? It was a gamble on my part, but I was betting that she would be more worried about her own marriage than about what Wendy might know. 

I think I won that bet. I had no way of knowing if she had gotten in touch with Wendy between the time I ordered my coffee and she sat down with me at one minute after four, but I'm pretty sure that she didn't. She would be afraid to do anything before knowing what I was going to talk about. At least that was my expectation. 

Joyce sat down across from me and said, "Okay Frank; what's going on here?" 

"A question for you Joyce and an honest answer would be in your best interest. Are you cheating on Harry?" 

"Hell no I'm not cheating on Harry. Why would you even think such a thing?" 

"I just wondered if you would also be spending time with a lover on your spa weekend." 

She sat there silent for a few seconds and then said, "I told her she was fucking up and warned her that she would get caught sooner or later. How did you find out?" 

"She told me." 

"She told you? She confessed?" 

"No. What she did was forget to put a stamp on a letter." 

I handed Joyce the letter with the envelope inside and waited while she read it. When she was done she handed it back to me and as I took it from her I said: 

"My first inclination was to go to Harry and tell him that we were both married to cheating whores, but then I decided to keep my mouth shut and talk to you instead. You tell me everything you know and I keep Harry out of it." 

"I'm not cheating on Harry." 

"Maybe not, but after he reads this letter and knows what Wendy is doing and that you are covering for her you think he won't start wondering about you and what you might be doing on those three days? You want him to start being suspicious of what you might be doing when he isn't around?" 

"Why would you do that to me Frank? I've never done anything to you." 

"Sure you have Joyce. You are helping my wife fuck over me. You are giving her cover. You know what she is doing. You just said it yourself. You told her she was fucking up so you know what she is doing and you are helping her and if that isn't doing something to me I don't know what is. What you need to do right now is figure out what is most important to you. Your friendship with Wendy or a trouble free marriage." 

"I want both Frank. How about a deal? I'll tell you all you want to know, but you never let Wendy know that it came from me. That way we can stay friends regardless of what happens with the two of you. And no, I'm not stabbing her in the back. You already know so all I'm doing is giving you background. There is one thing that needs to be straight between us Frank. Wendy is my best friend and I've known her since the second grade. I've only known you since you met her in college so expecting me to come to you and let you know she is being bad is totally unrealistic on your part. 

"Besides, she wasn't hurting you. She loves you and you know she does. This thing with Brandon is a fling; a silly infatuation that is bound to die in a short time. Brandon isn't half the man you are and Wendy knows it." 

"If she knows it then why in the hell this" I asked as I held up the letter. 

"It goes back to the ninth grade. Brandon Winters was everybody's everything. All State as a wide receiver on the football team. All City and All State as a forward on the basketball team. Star shortstop on the baseball team and a straight A student. Great looking and his daddy owned four car dealerships and so the family was wealthy as all get out. Wendy was infatuated with Brandon. She wanted to be his girl n the worst way, but he never seemed to notice her. 

"She made sure to go to places where she knew he would be just to put herself in front of him so he would have to notice her. It didn't matter what she did Brandon never gave her a tumble. In the eleventh grade she even asked him to the annual Sadie Hawkin's Day dance. He blew her off telling her he would be out of town. The night of the dance he showed up with Cindy Reynolds, but that still didn't stop her from trying to get his attention. 

"All through high school she tried and tried and kept trying to no avail. Then graduation came and he went back east to some big school and life moved on. Wendy eventually met you. She loves you Frank. Don't ever doubt that. I can't even remember how many times she has told me how happy she ha been since she met you." 

"How can I believe that Joyce? How can I possibly believe that after reading this letter? How can she possibly care for me as much as you say she does when she is stabbing me in the back with this Brandon guy?" 

"I don't know how to explain it frank, but it is some kind of ego thing, wish fulfillment, affirmation of self-worth or something like that. I really don't know. All I know is that about four months ago Wendy was shopping at Kohl's and Brandon was there, saw her and came up to her and said hi. He told her he had just moved back to town and maybe over lunch she could fill him in on what happened to our old classmates and stuff like that. They had lunch and exchanged phone numbers because he said he was going to try and set up a reunion like party. 

"He called her two days later and asked her if she would have a drink with him after work so they could talk about the party. She met him and they talked about where to have it, what kind of party it would be and the like. He called her a couple of more times and they talked on the phone about this party of his and then one day he asked her to meet him for lunch. Over lunch he confessed that there wasn't any party and it was just a way he could see her and talk to her. 

"Try to image how she was feeling Frank. The guy she had chased after for four years of high school was now wanting to get together with her. It fed something inside of her. The more he asked to see her the more she felt like.....Oh hell; I don't know. Anyway, she started having lunch with him and meeting for drinks after work with him and all the time he was coming on to her. After four years of chasing him he was now chasing her. I honestly doubt that he would have gotten anywhere with Wendy if you hadn't had to fly back to Michigan to settle your father's estate." 

"What in the hell did my father's estate have to do with anything?" 

"You were gone four days Frank and while you were gone Brandon put a full court press on Wendy. She had dinner and drinks with him every night you were gone and they went drinking and dancing on two of those nights. She never intended it to go anywhere Frank; honestly she didn't, but on the first night they went for dinner, drinking and dancing something happened. It just happened and Wendy couldn't even explain it to me. They were having a good time and suddenly they were in bed together. She wasn't drunk or drugged; it just happened. 

"She called me the next day crying. She hadn't meant to do it, but she had cheated on you and she felt guilty as hell. She wanted my advice. Should she call you and confess over the phone or wait for you to come home and do it face to face. I advised her to do neither. It would only hurt you. I told her that it was a one time regrettable mistake and what you didn't know wouldn't hurt you. I told her to put it behind her and then do her absolute best to be the best wife for you that she could be. 

"She only went out with him on the fourth night to tell him to leave her be because she was a happily married woman. When she told him that she had to quit seeing him he asked her how she could do it. He told her that they were meant for each other and she asked if that was true why had he ignored her for their four years of high school. He told her the reason was because he knew if he got together with her he would never be able to let her go. He had his life all laid out and a wife would have held him back. He had to fight his desire for her so he could go off and be the big success he wanted to be in the NFL. He told her that he knew that once he had achieved his goal they would find each other because they were meant to be. Wendy told me that she knew it was all bullshit, but somehow they ended up back in bed together. 

"She couldn't explain it to me because she said she couldn't understand it herself. She told me that it wasn't the sex because you were a much better lover than Brandon. In fact she played you up so much that if I wasn't ass end over teakettle in love with Harry I'd have been tempted to take a shot at you myself. What I think happened is that she spent so much time and effort on him in high school that now he was with her she just couldn't walk away from him. His being with her somehow justified all the effort she put in in trying to get him to notice her." 

"That shit sounds all too deep for me. For me it is as clear as day. She stabbed me in the back by fucking another man. I might have -- just might have -- gotten by the one night, but that trip to Michigan was four months ago and she is still seeing the cocksucker. Meeting him in motels for long lunches and setting up three day weekends with the asshole. How did you get sucked in to being a part of the Fuck Over Frank club?" 

"I'm not part of any club like that." 

"Of course you are. You are setting up a three day weekend for them." 

"I didn't set up anything for them. The spa visit is legitimate and I invited Wendy to go along with me. I had no idea she intended to use the weekend to meet Brandon until day before yesterday. That's when she told me that Brandon had made reservations at a hotel close to the spa. For what it is worth Frank I did tell her that she is being stupid and I also told her that I wouldn't lie for her if it came to that. She told me that she was going to use the weekend to end things with him." 

"That just doesn't jibe with what she wrote in the letter to him." 

"All that is Frank is her telling him what he wants to hear. It is just Wendy being Wendy. You know how compassionate she is. Build him up so she can let him down easy. Make him feel good so he won't feel so crushed when she tells him she has to go back to being a good wife for you. And she is that Frank. She is and always has been a good wife to you. Even with this silly fling with Brandon going on she has never shorted you when it came to showing love and affection and though she has never mentioned it to me I'd be willing to bet she hasn't shorted you sexually either. She is yours Frank and both Wendy and I know it even if you may doubt it. What are you going to do?" 

"I don't know Joyce. I have a lot to think about and I just don't know. It might help the process if you don't let her know that I'm aware of what is going on. I'm not sure that the confrontation that would take place if she knew that I knew is something that we could survive." 

"I know Wendy Frank and I know that the two of you can have a long and happy life if you can find someway to get past this." 

"I can't promise anything like that Joyce. I know me pretty well and I'm not at all sure that I want to get past it even if I could. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

I do indeed know myself pretty well and one of the things I know about me is that I won't put up with being fucked with. I found that out in the eighth grade. Even though a growth spurt in the early years of high school that brought me up to six feet I'd been small for my age in elementary and middle school. As a result I got picked on a lot by guys that were bigger. 

The first time it happened was around the third or fourth grade and I went home crying. My mom asked me what was wrong and I told her. Then she asked me what I had done to the kid that beat on me and I told her that I'd done nothing to him since he was bigger than me. Then she told me that he would keep on picking on me because he knew I'd let him get away with it. 

"You don't back down from bullies Frankie; you go after them. You let them know that if they mess with you they will have to pay for the privilege with pain. The easiest way to put a stop to it Frankie is to let them know that you will not settle for letting them use you as a punching bag. It doesn't matter if you win or lose baby; what matters most is that you fight back. 

"You do not give anyone a free ride. 

"The bullies will see that and they will leave you alone. Most will anyway although there will always be one or two stupid ones who are too dumb to learn. Just make sure you make them pay baby. Remember honey; no one, absolutely no one gets s free ride." 

I listened to mom and I took what she said to heart and the next time a bigger kid came after me he got a bloody nose for his trouble. I got a black eye and a split lip out of it, but had the satisfaction of seeing his blood on the front of his shirt. Mom was right. After a couple of more scraps the bullies decided that it wasn't worth the effort to fuck with me. 

It wasn't until the eighth grade that I found out how far I was willing to go if someone bigger than me fucked with me. There was a kid in my class named Elmore and he wasn't any bigger than me, but he liked to fuck with kids because he had a big brother who was in the eleventh grade and if you did anything to Elmore his brother Marcus would come down on you like a ton of bricks. Marcus was big and bad. Six foot four and over two hundred pounds and you just did not mess with his little brother. Elmore took plenty of advantage of that fact. Secure in the knowledge that everyone knew Marcus would fall on anyone who messed with him Elmore screwed with anyone he felt like screwing with. Eventually it was my turn. 

Elmore's locker was right next to mine and one day between classes I was at my locker changing books when Elmore came up to me and pushed me saying: 

"Out of my way twerp." 

I pushed him back so hard that he fell on his ass. He got up and came to me and poked a finger in my chest, but before he could say anything I grabbed his hand, bent his finger back and shoved him away from me so hard that he fell on his ass a second time. Several other kids saw what happened and they laughed at him. I got the book I needed for my next class and walked away leaving a crying Elmore sitting on the floor. 

That afternoon I was again at my locker when a hand grabbed my shoulder and spun me around. It was Marcus and standing behind him was a smirk on his face was Elmore. 

"You hurt my brother asshole" and he punched me so hard in my stomach that I doubled over and puked on the floor. "Let that be a lesson asshole; leave my brother alone." 

He and Elmore walked away. It took a minute or two, but I finally got myself together and went to the boy's lavatory and got some paper towels to clean up my mess. 

On my way home I fumed over what happened. I didn't get a chance to make him pay a price however minor it might have been and he had gotten a free ride. Realistically I knew that fighting back would have been a total waste of time and energy as he had a good five or six inches and sixty or seventy pounds on me, but he got a free ride and that galled me. The more I thought about it the more upset I got over it.  

===

He had gotten a free ride! 

I couldn't have that. I had to do something, but what? It must have come to me while I slept because when I got up in the morning I knew exactly what I was going to do. That afternoon when Marcus was going into his locker I came up behind him with a baseball bat and smacked him in the head with it. Not a full swing like I was going for a pitch, but a downward chopping strike and Marcus went to his knees. I smacked him on the side of his head again and he fell to the floor. I kicked his legs apart and used the bat on his crotch. Only once, but hard. I bent down, grabbed a handful of his hair and pulled his head up until it was only inches from my mouth and then said: 

"You might be bigger than me asshole, but you aren't anywhere near as mean. You ever fuck with me again you better grow eyes in the back of your head or you won't see me coming and the next time I'll use the bat to take your head clean off of your shoulders," 

I looked up and saw Elmore standing there staring at me open mouthed and wide eyed. I looked him in the eye and said: 

"Start running motherfucker; you're next!" 

I stood up and Elmore took off running. As I watched him go I heard clapping and I looked around and saw a dozen other students who had seen what happened. I heard things like "Way to go dude" and "About time someone straightened out those cocksuckers." 

Word got around that it didn't pay to fuck with Frank and I was never bothered by Marcus again and every time Elmore saw me coming his way he turned around and hurried off in another direction. 

So I did indeed know me pretty well and I knew that I wouldn't let myself be fucked over or fucked with and Brandon Winters was about to find that out the hard way. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I had Brandon's address courtesy of Wendy's forgetting to put a stamp on the envelope and I drove over to check out the area. It was an apartment complex and Brandon's unit was on the first floor. There wasn't much in the way of cover around and it was too open. Also there was too much of a chance that there would be witnesses around. 

I looked at my watch as saw that it was seven-thirty which was a half hour later than I usually got home so I called the house and Wendy answered. I told her I was running late and would be home in about a half an hour. She told me that she would have dinner waiting. 

As I was putting my phone away a late model Chevy Silverado pulled up and parked in front of Brandon's apartment. A man got out, walked up to the door of apartment 107 and put his key in the lock. It was my first look at Brandon Winters and that look told me I was going to have to find another baseball bat. He had to be six five and two forty and toe to toe in a fair fight I wouldn't stand a chance. 

Who was I kidding! Fair fight had never entered in to my thinking. I was thinking punishment! Harsh punishment! You fuck another man's wife you deserve to be hurt. You fuck with me and mine you deserve to be hurt badly! No free ride my mom had told me; do not ever give anyone a free ride. 

I drove home to face my wife and as I drove I ran the words of the letter I'd read seven hours ago through my mind. Was I going to be able to hide what I was feeling from her? I didn't know if I could be as good an actor as she was an actress. I hoped that I could pull it off. A confrontation would no doubt have her on the phone to Winters and I did not want that. I did not want him to se me coming. 

+++++++++++++++ 

I was greeted with a hug and a kiss and I couldn't help but wonder if she'd had a long lunch that day and had sucked the asshole' cock.. As we hugged I ran my hands down her back and squeezed her ass. 

"Later big guy" she said. "Dessert comes later." 

Again the thought popped into my mind. Would I be getting sloppy seconds? Maybe not sloppy, but still seconds? 

We sat down to eat and apparently I was not as good at acting as she was. 

"Something bothering you" she asked. "You seem a little off tonight." 

"I got some bad news today. I guess it is still on my mind." 

"It have anything to do with you coming home early today?" 

"What?" 

"The mail was on the kitchen counter so I know you came home." 

I told about taking Joe to the hospital and coming home for lunch. 

"That's the bad news?" 

"No. They are talking lay-offs at work." 

"That shouldn't affect you. You've got seniority." 

"Doesn't matter. The point is that if business doesn't pick up and things keep getting worse they may end up closing the doors all together." 

That was all total bullshit. The company had just posted record profits and I already knew the size of the bonus I would be getting, but Wendy didn't know any of that and the story kept her from thinking that it was something else. Like maybe her fucking around on me. 

After dinner we snuggled on the couch and watched TV until Wendy grabbed the remote and shut the thing off. She put the remote on the coffee table and said: 

"It is time for dessert lover." 

She got up and headed for the bathroom and I got up and followed along. I wasn't all that happy with Wendy at the moment, but pussy was pussy and it made no sense to turn it down when it was offered. Especially when I might be going without for a while once I brought my new found knowledge out into the open. And if she'd had a 'long lunch' with Winters that day it wouldn't be the first time I'd followed a cock into a pussy. Happened a lot at our frat parties when I was in college, but that's a story for another time. 

Wendy was as ardently sexual as she usually was and I couldn't tell if I was the first one into her that day or not, but unless Winters had a horse cock that would stretch her out I wouldn't be able to tell anyway. I had to concede the point that Joyce had made when she said that Wendy never slacked off when it came to her love and affection for me. I had no doubt that Wendy meant it when the sex was over and she snuggled into me and said, "I love you." 

++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning at work I had a nine o'clock meeting with my boss and I told him I was having some personal problems that I needed to take care of and that I needed to use some of the comp time I'd built up. I told him I would needed three days and he told me that he had no problem with it, but he did ask me to check in once a day in case something came up that he would need my input on. 

I really needed to put those three days to good use. Wendy would be leaving from work for her three day weekend on Friday. She got off work at five-thirty so I had roughly seventy-eight hours to make sure that I could ruin her weekend for her. 

I knew that Harry was at work and that Joyce had Tuesdays off so I called her at home. 

"What can you tell me about Winters? Where does he work? Does he bowl or do anything when he isn't fucking my wife?" 

"From the sound of your voice frank I don't know if I should tell you anything. You sound like you are trying to get information so you can find him and hurt him." 

"That would bother you? You another one hung up on him since high school?" 

"Not hardly. It may come as a surprise to you Frank, but I like you and I'd just as soon not see you going to jail over trash like Brandon." 

"It is going to happen Joyce. Sooner or later it is going to happen and the sooner it happens the sooner Wendy will be free of him." 

In the end she gave me what she had and it was enough. I knew where he worked, his hours and the fact that he bowled in a men's house league on Wednesdays. I drove over to where Winters worked and found that since the place was downtown it had no parking lot of its own. A little snooping got me the information that his company had reserved parking places for its employees in one of the four level downtown parking structures. 

I found a parking place, fed the meter, and then went inside the structure. I found Winters Silverado on the third level. I reconnoitered the place and couldn't find any video cameras so I marked the place down as a possible site for my 'meeting' with Mr. Brandon Winters. I went back to my car and the drove around the block until a parking spot opened that would allow me to stake out the exit from the parking structure. I parked, fed the meter and then settled in to wait. When lunch time came and went and Winters didn't leave I figured that Wendy wasn't going to get laid that afternoon. 

Next I drove over to the bowling alley and checked it out. Parking there was too wide open and the odds were that when Winters came out after bowling others would be coming out at the same time. It would not be a good choice for an ambush and given Winters size an ambush was what it was going to have to be. I wasn't looking for a fair fight. I was looking to inflict punishment and it looked like the parking structure was going to be the place. 

Having made that decision I hit the public library, got the daily paper and sat down to read until it was my regular time to go home. When I got home Wendy had dinner waiting. She was in a cheerful mood and I wondered if it was because she was looking forward to her three day weekend. 

After dinner I spent some time doing household chores and then joined Wendy to watch some TV before bedtime. Wendy was in an amorous mood and she reached for my cock as soon as we were on the bed. I didn't push her hand away. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Wednesday morning I was up early and out of the house. I drove over to the apartments were Winters lived and I parked where I could keep an eye on the Silverado. I followed him to work and when he entered the parking structure I took the ticket from the machine and followed him in. I drove really slow so I could observe what Winters did after he parked. I noticed that there was no one else around as he parked, got out of the truck and walked to the elevators. 

I left and killed time until a half hour before lunch and then I was back to keep an eye on the exit. He came out at twelve-ten and I followed him, but he only drove to Wal-Mart and then after some shopping he went back to work. 

I killed the afternoon browsing through bookstores and then went back to the parking structure where I was lucky enough to find a stall where I could park and watch the Silverado and I settled in to wait. At five-ten the asshole came off the elevator with three others. It was obvious that they were not together. I watched as they all split up and went to their vehicles and then I followed Winters as he left. 

He drove home and I parked and watched until he came out and I followed him to the bowling alley where I confirmed that it was not the place to have my 'meeting' with the asshole. Too many people around and no good cover for someone who wanted to lurk and lie in wait. I didn't bother to stick around. If there were that many people going into the lanes at the same time asshole did there would more than likely be the same amount coming out when he did. I didn't bother to stick around. 

I went home and found a slightly pissed off Wendy. 

"Where have you been? Dinner has been ready for almost an hour." 

"Got hung up at work" I said which got me "You could have at least called to let me know." 

"I did try. Twice" I lied "And both times I got a busy signal." 

She didn't push after I said that so it was likely that she had been on the phone. Maybe even talking to the asshole. After dinner I got a surprise. 

"What suitcases are you going to use this weekend?" 

"Why would you ask me that?" 

"Because the ones you don't use I'll use. I'm going to go to the lake this weekend." 

"Without me?" 

"Of course without you. You will be at the spa with Joyce this weekend." 

"No I won't. I cancelled." 

"Why?" 

"I didn't want to go three days without seeing you." 

"I appreciate the thought, but I don't think that is reason enough to cancel a fun trip. It is only three days." 

"It is a good enough reason for me. Do you realize that with the exception of when you went back to Michigan to handle your father's estate we have never been apart since the day we married? Those four days you were gone were the worst four days of our marriage for me. I don't want to be apart from you that long ever again. At least not if I can help it." 

I looked at her as I thought "The worst four days of our marriage? You happily fucked your old high school crush and enjoyed it so much that you kept on doing it and it was the worst four days for you? Give me a fucking break!" 

That's what I thought, but what I said was, "If you are sure about it of course you will go to the lake with me." 

She gave me a big smile and said, "I've been thinking about what to have for dessert. I think a lot better in the bedroom. Want to join me there and see what we can come up with?" 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Thursday I timed my visit to the restaurant to coincide with Joyce's lunch period and offered to buy her lunch if she would join me. She laughed and said: 

"It will really be a cheap date for you since one of my benefits here is free meals." 

She did sit and have her lunch with me and over the meal I said: 

"Wendy told me that she cancelled on you for this weekend." 

"I figured that is why you are here." 

"What gives?" 

"She called me yesterday and told me that she wasn't going. She told me that she needed a clean break from Brandon and a three day tapering off wasn't the way to do it. She called him Tuesday and told him that she wouldn't see him again. She also said that she didn't ever want to be separated from you again. Not even for just three days." 

"So it isn't being cancelled because she knows that I know?" 

"If she knows she didn't get it from me. Outside of being Wendy's sounding board and shoulder to cry on I've stayed out of it other than to tell her she was stupid to risk losing you." She paused and then asked, "Has she lost you?" 

"I don't know Joyce. I honestly don't know. The answer to that question if you had asked it the first time I talked to you would have been "How can you even ask such a stupid question? Of course I'm gone" but now? I don't honestly know." 

"Well when you do try to decide keep in mind that the girl really does love you." 

What I did know when I left the restaurant that even though Wendy had supposedly put an end to her relationship with Winters he still had to pay a price for fucking my wife. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Winters got off the elevator at five-eleven with two other people and the three headed for their respective vehicles. The other two started up and left while Winters stood and looked at his flat left rear tire and swore. 

He got out the jack, lowered the spare and then bent to loosen the lug nuts. I moved up quietly behind him and smacked him n the head with the aluminum ball bat and when he was down on the floor I worked over his crotch with the bat until I was satisfied that he wouldn't be fucking anybody else woman for a long time. I took his wallet, watch and the ring off his finger and then I took off and left him lying there. 

I had been wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a ski mask and I hadn't said a word the entire time. He might realize that it might have been me, but he had no way of knowing for sure or of proving it. The cops would know that it wasn't a straight up mugging and robbery because a mugger wouldn't have wasted time working over Winters crotch. They would ask him about who might have it in for him, but whether or not he would admit to fucking my wife I had no way of knowing. 

It didn't matter because they had no way of proving it was me. I got rid of everything I was wearing when I did the deed right down to the shoes and socks I had been wearing. The wallet, watch and ring went into a dumpster behind the Safeway on the other side of town and the ball bat and gloves I had worn were tossed into the dumpster behind the library. If the police did come to me and ask me where I was at the time of the beating I'd just say I was out driving around while thinking over some problems that came up at work, but I didn't think the cops would pursue it. They had better things to do with their time than to waste it trying to find out who had fucked up an asshole that chased after married women. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

If they did come looking they didn't find me because Wendy and I were at the lake. For three days we swam, fished, laid in the sun and fucked like bunnies. 

By the time we got home I was rethinking kicking Wendy to the curb. True, she had cheated on me, but she had felt guilty for doing it and she had ended it. In a way I could see how it happened and in truth I could actually see it happen to me. I had crushed on Pauline French from the seventh grade until high school graduation, but had never been able to get anywhere with her. If I had run into her all these may years later and she had let me know she was available would I have said: 

"Sorry, but I'm married" or would I have said, "Yes! Finally!" 

I honestly didn't know. I wouldn't have bet money on it either way. But I could see it happening. Oh yes could I ever see it happening. Pauline was that hot! 

I guess what it all boiled down to was could I believe that Wendy did indeed love me and wanted to stay with me for the rest of her life? 

Could I believe she was dead serious when she said she couldn't bear to be apart from me for even three days? 

Could I bring myself to believe that Brandon Winters was an aberration and something that would never be repeated? 

Could I live with knowing that I'd been a cuckold for a couple of months? 

Was Wendy worth taking the chance? 

After many long hours of hard thought the only answers I could come up with to all those questions was yes. Report_Story
