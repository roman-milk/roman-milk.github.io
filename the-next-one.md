 ****** The Next One Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Note to readers -- There are no sexual situations in this story where the participants are under eighteen. 

 Also, I am well aware that the National Guard the way I describe it here is not the way that it really is at this time. The way I have described it is the way that it was in my time and that is the way it works best for the story. If it bothers you just think of this story as taking place in an alternate universe. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I don't know where I should start. There are several places where I could begin. The place where things started to go bad would be one, the place where the whole story started would be another and there were several places in between the two that could be a jumping off point. The day we met, the day I proposed, the day I deployed to Afghanistan or the day I returned are but a few. Then there would be the day we were married or the day she went to work at Cutter and Sons. Maybe even the day I went to work for XYZ and my subsequent promotions. But the more I think on it I guess that in order to grasp the full picture I need to start at the beginning. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was six years old at the time. A new family had moved in next door to us during the summer vacation and my parents went over the day they moved in and introduced themselves. They invited the newcomers to dinner since they probably had not unpacked their pots and pans yet. 

 The new couple came over for dinner and they had a five year old daughter with them. Allison was introduced to me and my mother said: 

 "Isn't it great Frankie? Now you have a playmate right next door." 

 Being a typical six year old boy I grimaced and thought to myself, "But she's a girl." Allison was shy and spent most of her time looking at me while hiding behind her parents. 

 We never did play together that summer although we did get thrown together several times. Our parents became the best of friends and one Saturday at a cookout Allison's parents asked if my parents knew a good babysitter. It seemed that they had something to go to the next evening and my mom said: 

 "You can leave her here with us. She and Frankie can keep each other company." 

 "Oh no; we couldn't ask you to do that." 

 "Sure you can. Some day you can do the same for us." 

 After that the only time I saw a babysitter was when both sets of parents went out together and then of course the sitter watched both me and Allison. 

 Allison and I were at odds from the start. She played with dolls and I played with toy cars and trucks. She wanted to move furniture around in her dollhouse and I wanted to build things with my erector set. She couldn't understand why I wouldn't help her dress her dolls or play "Mommy and Daddy" and move things around in her dumb old doll house. Like I said earlier, "she was girl." Girls didn't know nothing about trucks, cars and plastic soldiers. She wouldn't play "Cops and Robbers" or "Cowboys and Indians" with me. She was just a dumb old girl. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 Summer ended and school started and I was told that I had to walk Allison to school. She was starting kindergarten and hadn't been to any kind of pre-school so she was scared and the closer we got to the school the more scared she got and somewhere along the way she grabbed my hand for comfort. I tried to shake it loose, but she held on for dear life. As a result we arrived at school holding hands and all the guys saw it. 

 "Stay away from Frankie. He's holding hands with a girl so he probably caught cooties" and other stuff like that filled the air. 

 After school I had to wait for her so she could walk home with me and again it started. "Frankie's gonna get cooties" and the dreaded "Frankie's got a girlfriend, Frankie's got a girlfriend." I was red with shame as we walked home. 

 The next day Allison wasn't scared so she didn't try to hold my hand, but our parents were firm in their insistence that we should walk to school together and walk home together so I was stuck with it. Stuck with it maybe, but I didn't have to arrive with her next to me. As soon as school was in sight I picked up the pace and was a good ten feet in front of her when I went up the school steps. After school I waited for her and when she came out the door I started walking and I didn't slow down and let her catch up until we were out of sight of the school. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 As we got older I was relieved of the duty of being Allison's escort to school and by the time she was seven she was walking alone or with some girlfriends. Since we left our houses about the same time each morning I sometimes walked with her and her girlfriends. Our arriving at school that first day was in the past and forgotten by the kids who had tormented me over it. 

 Things were normal until one day she wore her hair in pigtails to school. As I remember it she was ten at the time and I was eleven, almost twelve. School let out for the day and as I came down the front steps I saw Allison and two of her friends surrounded by four or five guys. At first I thought nothing of it, but then I heard Allison yelp and it sounded like she was in pain. I headed over and I saw that Bert Ellsworth had his hands on Allison's pigtails and he was jerking her head back and forth. He was laughing and saying "Gee" and Haw" as he pulled her head this way and that. "Good little horsey" he said as he jerked her head to the right and Allison yelped again. I walked up to Bert and told him to leave Allison alone and he sneered at me and said: 

 "And if I don't?" 

 I hit him and he dropped Allison's pigtails, took a step back and I stepped forward, put both hands against his chest and pushed. He staggered backwards and fell on his ass. He started crying, got up and ran off. While that was going on Allison and her two friends hurried off toward home. 

 When I got home my mom was waiting for me and she was pissed. 

 "I just had a phone call from Sally Ellsworth and she told me that you had beaten up her son and she wanted to know what I was going to do about it. Did you? Did you get in a fight with him?" 

 I started to tell her what had happened, but she cut me off and said, "I won't have it Franklin! I just will not tolerate it. No child of mine is going to be a bully. You hear me? I won't have it! Get up to your room and stay there until your father comes home!" 

 I ran to my room crying and whining that it wasn't fair; that all I did was what they told me to do which was watch out for Allison. I went to my room, slammed the door behind me and threw myself don't on the bed. "It isn't fair, it isn't fair" I kept saying over and over to myself. 

 I'd been in my room maybe five minutes when I heard Mrs. Ames (Allison's mom) come in the house. 

 "Where is he? Where is that young man?" and I thought "Now what did I do?" I'd only ever heard "young man" when I was in trouble for something like the time I tripped and stumbled and tried to catch myself by grabbing the table. The lamp fell off the table and broke on the floor and my mother came into the room, saw the broken lamp and said: 

 "And what do you have to say for yourself young man?" 

 Apparently mom told Mrs. Ames I was in my room because I heard feet running up the steps. My door flew open and Mrs. Ames said, "There you are" and she walked over to me and hugged me. Then she kissed me on the cheek and said: 

 "Thank you Frankie. Thank you for being Allison's protector." 

 My mom was standing in the door watching and I was thinking, "What the fuck?" (Yes -- I knew the word -- I was eleven you know). I have one adult hugging me and kissing me and one yelling at me and sending me to my room and for doing the same thing. Grown ups didn't make sense. 

 My dad came home and asked me what happened and after I told him he and Mr. Ames went to see Mr. and Mrs. Ellsworth and I never heard another word about it, but Bert stayed clear of me for the next couple of years. 

 There was another outcome, but it didn't surface for another five years and when it did it was coupled with something else from the past. Once (and I was told this years later) when my mom and Mrs. Ames were in the kitchen making salads for a backyard cook out they were jokingly making plans for Allison and I to be married when we grew up. Allison was in the kitchen and she heard them, but she was only six or seven at the time and while she heard it she didn't really know what it meant -- then! 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The next five years went by and because of all the time the two families spent together Allison and I grew closer to each other in a brother/sister sort of way. I was long past where I thought that girls gave you cooties and I was starting to pay closer attention to them. The truth of the matter is that I 'was sweet' on a couple of them. I couldn't seem to keep my eyes off of Nancy Wilde or Beverly Abbeg. 

 One day as we were leaving school Nancy dropped one of her books and I picked it up and ended up carrying her books and walking her home. That started me walking her home every day after school and one day I asked her to go to the movies with me and she said yes. It was just after my third date with Nancy and the day after my sixteenth birthday when Allison asked me what I was doing dating Nancy. 

 "What kind of question is that?" 

 "You aren't supposed to be dating other girls; you are supposed to be mine." 

 "I'm supposed to be yours? Says who?" 

 "Your mom and my mom are planning the wedding." 

 "Get serious Allie." 

 "I am serious. I overheard them planning our wedding." 

 "We aren't old enough to get married Allie." 

 "Maybe not, but when we are it is supposed to be you and me; not you and Nancy Wilde." 

 I started laughing and walked away from her. 

 The next day when I got home from school I found my mom and Mrs. Ames waiting for me. 

 "Why did you send Allison home crying yesterday? What did you do to her?" 

 "I didn't do anything to her." 

 I told them about what Allie had said and my mom asked me what I did then. 

 "I laughed at her." 

 I saw both mothers look at each other and then my mom asked, "Why did you laugh at her?" 

 "Cause it was just so dumb. Me getting married to Allison? Come on; give me a break here." 

 "Why? What is wrong with Allison?" 

 "She's only fourteen." 

 "She will be fifteen next week." 

 "So?" 

 "She's a beautiful girl Frankie and she's obviously stuck on you. Give her a chance Frankie. It wouldn't hurt you to take her out on a date." 

 I looked from one to the other and it hit me. "It's true. You are trying to hook us up. She wasn't kidding when she said that you guys are already planning the wedding." 

 "She probably overheard us once when we were joking around, but that's beside the point. Why don't you take her out on a date?" 

 I let them brow-beat me into it and the next day I asked Allison for a date. 

 "Why do you want to go out with me?" 

 I wasn't about to tell her that our mothers were behind it so I said, "I finally stopped looking at you like a sister and woke up to the fact that you are a beautiful girl." 

 "Beautiful? Me? You really think that?" 

 The truth was that I did. I HAD stopped looking at her like a sister and saw that indeed she was a damned good looking girl. We went to the movies Saturday and after the movie we went over on Elk Street and played miniature golf. We ended the day at Harry's Malt Shop and we were holding hands when we walked home. 

 We kissed on the third and fourth dates and on Sunday after that fourth date our parents went somewhere together and Allie came over to my house and we made out on the living room couch. From then on we were a couple. By the time I was seventeen our mothers were jokingly asking if they could start planning the wedding and I was saying "not quite yet" and Allie was saying "Spoil sport! Let them get an early start on it." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was a good student in that I had good attendance and got good -- but not great -- grades, but I hated school so I knew that college was not in my future. I did know that I was going to need a trade so I looked around and tried to guess what would be a good thing for me to try. I decided that computers were here to stay and a little checking showed that the best training in computers and other electronics could be gotten by joining the service. 

 The only problem there was that I wasn't interested in giving up three years of my life just to learn a trade. Then a friend told me about the National Guard. After basic training and schooling I only had to give them one weekend a month and two weeks every summer. There were no wars going on and there didn't look to be any on the horizon so I signed on the dotted line and as soon as I graduated from high school and turned eighteen I would be off to Camp Bonner for training. I told Allie that I would be back in time for her prom and by the time she graduated high school we could see where we were. 

 "What do you mean by that? I'm yours and you are mine and that isn't going to change just because you are going to be gone for a while. But I'm holding you to your telling me that you will be back in time to take me to my prom." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I did my basic with no problems and did well enough in the Electronics Technician course that they offered me a place in the advanced electronics course. With training over I was back home in time to take Allison to her senior prom, but she told me that she already had a date and that it was too late to break it. 

 I wasn't happy with it and I was even less happy when I found out that for the entire time I was gone she had been dating the guy she was going to the prom with. I found that out when I stopped in at Harry's Malt Shop the second night I was back and ran into some guys that I had gone to school with. I also heard that the guy she was dating was bragging about popping her cherry and telling everyone how good she was at giving blow jobs. 

 The next day I started job hunting and the first place I hit, XYZ Industries, hired me. When Mr. Acker's, the interviewer, asked me what kind of experience I had I told him no actual work experience, but that I had just finished Electronics Technician training. 

 "What school" he asked me and I told him. "Basic and Advanced?" he asked. 

 "Yes." 

 "What was your class standing?" 

 "Third in Basic and Fourth in Advanced." 

 "In Advanced was Tim Worthman your instructor?" 

 "For the last half of it. The first half was taught by Sgt. Parkman." 

 He asked me to have a seat in his outer office and twenty minutes later he called me back into his office and told me I was hired and could start work the next day. I found out later that Ackers was Sgt. Worthman's cousin and that Acker's had called him and asked about me. 

 My parents offered to turn the basement into an apartment for me until I could set enough money aside to strike out on my own and I took them up on it. I borrowed enough from my dad to buy a fairly decent Ford F-250 and then I settled in to start my life as an employed adult. 

 I'd been back a week when my mom asked me why I wasn't going out with Allison and I told her that Allison had a boyfriend and that it wasn't me. She told me that I was being silly and that Allison wouldn't do that to me. I told her what Allison told me about her prom and I told her about what I had found out from my friends (I held back the 'cherry popping and blow jobs) and pointed out the fact that Allison lived right next door and had made no attempt to see me or call me. 

 "Oh come on Frankie; you know better than that. She isn't supposed to have to come after you. You're the guy Frankie; you do the calling and visiting." 

 "I did that mom. That's how I found out that I wasn't going to be taking her to the prom. She made me promise that I would be back in time to take her and she told me she was going to hold me to that promise. I kept the promise mom. Here I am and she told me that she had a date for the prom and couldn't break it. As far as I'm concerned Allison is history." 

 "I'm sure you are mistaken Frankie. It must just be a misunderstanding." 

 "No it isn't mom and I would appreciate it if you and Mrs. Ames would not try and 'fix it'. Please leave it alone." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Thursday evening I got a call from Marv Pallister asking me if I wanted to go to a party on Friday and I told him I'd love to go. Marv had gone from high school to college and had joined a fraternity. It was my first time at a frat party and I was surprised. Most of the people there were in their late teens, but beer and stronger alcohol were readily available. They had a keg of Miller and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic punches. I was no stranger to beer since I was able to get it at the Enlisted Man's Club while I was in training. 

 I knew several people there so I got a cup, hit the keg and then walked around and socialized. After I'd been there about an hour I noticed a girl with several guys around her. I didn't recognize her and I mentioned to Marv that she seemed to be pretty popular. 

 "They are probably feeding her booze to get her drunk enough to pull a train." 

 "She's done it before?" 

 "Don't know. I've never seen her here before." 

 "You don't find that wrong?" 

 "What's wrong with it? Girls who come to frat parties alone have a pretty good idea of what to expect." 

 "If she does it sober yeah, but if you have to get her drunk to make it happen?" 

 "Not my problem. I don't participate. Girls that have multiple partners pick things up. I don't want them sharing with me." 

 "What if she hollers rape when it is over? You want to be known as a member of this fraternity if she brings the cops and the administration down on the place?" 

 "You are sweating over nothing." 

 I just shook my head and walked away from him. I'd known Marv for a good many years and for the most part he was a good guy so I did my best to hide my disgust from him. 

 I kept my eye on the girl and it wasn't hard to do. Five five and a hundred and ten with long brown hair and a very sexy body topped by a beautiful face. Once when a guy brought her a drink I thought I saw him drop something in it, About ten minutes later the guys with her left her alone while they went to get more drinks or to find an empty room, but for just a bit she was all alone. 

 I walked over to her, took her by the elbow and walked her unresistingly out of the house. She squinted at me and in a slurred voice she asked me who I was. I told her that I was a friend and that seemed to satisfy her. I got her in my truck and drove away from the house. 

 It wasn't until I was two blocks away that I thought to ask myself, "Okay; now what?" I couldn't take her home with me and I didn't know who she was or where she lived and even if she was coherent enough to tell me did I want to be the one to take her home in the condition she was in? I would get the blame and I had no doubt about that. I finally decided to check in to a motel. 

 By the time I got the key and got back to the truck she was passed out and I had to carry her into the room. I pulled the covers down on one bed and put her on it and pulled her shoes off of her. I arranged her on the bed and pulled the covers over her and then sat down on the other bed and asked myself why in the hell I hadn't just minded my own business. I sat there looking at the passed out girl for a bit and then I fell back on the bed and tried to get some sleep. 

 Slamming car doors woke me in the morning as people loaded up their cars to leave. I looked over at the girl and saw that she was still out. I got up, walked to the windows and moved the drapes aside and looked out and in the daylight I saw a McDonalds across the street. I looked over at the girl and saw that she still hadn't moved so I thought it would be okay to leave her alone for a few minutes. 

 I walked over to McD's and got two Egg McMuffins and two coffees and went back to the room. She was awake when I got back and when I walked into the room and she saw me she jumped off the bed, ran into the bathroom and I heard the lock click. I walked over to the door and said in a voice loud enough for her to hear:  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "You'll notice that you are fully dressed and if you check yourself out you'll see that nothing happened to you. There's a coffee and an Egg McMuffin on the vanity counter for you. You need to do whatever it is that you are going to do so that I can run you home or to wherever you left your car." 

 I turned on the TV and was watching the news and weather and working on my coffee when the bathroom door opened and she cautiously came out. She looked at me and then the food on the counter and she picked it up and sat down on the edge of her bed. She took a bite of the McMuffin and asked: 

 "Who are you and what is going on here?" 

 I didn't tell her my name, but I told her what I had observed and what I'd done. 

 "I am so in trouble" she said' "My parents must be frantic right now. I'm going to be grounded until I'm eighty-five." 

 "It could have been worse." 

 "How?" 

 "You could have woken up naked on a mattress in a frat house bedroom." 

 "Oh God; don't say that." 

 "Do I take you to your car or drive you home?" 

 "I don't have a car. I was with a date last night." 

 "What happened to him? How did he let you get into the situation that you were in?" 

 "He got drunk and was passed out before we were even there an hour." 

 "Well we need to get you home then. The sooner we do that the less likely your folks will have the cops out looking for you." 

 She gave me her address and told me how to get there. When I pulled up in front of the house she hesitated for a few moments and then started to get out of the truck. 

 "You're coming in to tell them what happened, right?" 

 "Oh no. I'd be the guy closest to hand and I'd be the one to get all the blame. No thanks. Good luck." 

 I put the truck in gear and pulled away. As I drove off it occurred to me that I didn't know her name. No matter; she didn't know mine either and that is what counted. No way for her parents to get to me. Or so I thought. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Saturday afternoon I got a call from Gloria Buggins telling me that a bunch of kids I'd graduated with were having a skating party at Skate City and she asked me if I wanted to come. There were maybe eighteen kids from my class there and Gloria attached herself to me and stayed my skating partner pretty much the entire evening. I did skate with Harlina Collins and Nancy Neubert a couple of times each, but Gloria took up the majority of my time. 

 When things broke up we all headed for the Sonic Drive In. Gloria had ridden to the rink with Pauline French, but Pauline had left the party early and Gloria asked me if I would give her a ride. There was a full moon out that night and when we got ready to leave the Sonic Gloria asked me how long it had been since I had been out to Steven's Point to see the full moon reflected off the lake. Steven's Point was the local 'make out' spot so I had a pretty good idea of what Gloria was interested in and I also had a pretty good idea of the reason why. 

 Something had happened between Allison and Gloria several years back and the two of them despised each other. I would have bet a month's pay that a trip to The Point with Gloria would reach Allison's ears by noon the next day. It didn't take any thought on my part at all. After all, I didn't owe Allison a thing. 

 Gloria was not shy in letting me know what she wanted. After ten minutes of making out Gloria said: 

 "I've been on the pill since I was sixteen Frank." 

 I looked her right in the eye and said, "And Allison finds out how? You going to tell her yourself or do you have someone else set up to do it?" 

 "Why honey; how could you possibly think that of me?" and then she laughed and said, "I'm going to do it myself." 

 I unbuckled my belt, pulled down my zipper and said, "Go for it." 

 Gloria laughed and said, "I never thought it would be this easy. Pull your zipper back up. My folks are gone for the weekend and I would much rather use a bed than the seat of a truck." 

 I drove to her place and she led me to her bedroom. As I undressed I asked: 

 "If it wasn't for Allison would I even be here?" 

 "If it wasn't for Allison you would have been here a long time ago." 

 "How is that?" 

 "There were several girls besides me that were interested in you, but Allison stuck to you like glue and we couldn't get to you. I was surprised when you came back that the two of you didn't get back together. I decided to make my move before Allison got her head out of her ass." 

 "Head out of her ass?" 

 "She's been hanging with Tony Spears and he is a prime twit and a total asshole. She is going to realize that sooner or later and by then I hope to have you firmly under my spell." 

 By then she was naked and she spun around in front of me and asked, "You like?" 

 Yes indeed I did and I spent the next four hours showing her just how much. Gloria had no limits and didn't hesitate in asking for what she wanted. She sucked my cock and then asked me to eat her pussy. I'd only done it once and I told her I might not be very good at it and all she said was: 

 "Good. I can teach you how I like it done." 

 She had me work on her for about ten minutes before she told me "Enough, at least for now. Get up here now and drive the nail home." 

 It had been a while for me and so I came quick and I'd no sooner pulled out than she went down on me to get me hard again. As soon as I was up again she mounted me cowgirl and then she did most of the work until she got us both off again and then she said: 

 "Eat me again Frankie." 

 "But you have cum in you," 

 "So what? It's yours. It won't kill you. Swing around into a sixty-nine and we can do each other." 

 I hesitated and she said, "Come on Frankie; you've got a good thing going here if you don't screw it up." 

 I took that to mean that we were going to be together for a while if I went along with her program and I got to thinking that eating her might be a small price to pay for steady pussy and so I prayed that I wouldn't upchuck and ruin things and I bent to the task. It didn't kill me and when Gloria got me up again she said: 

 "Good boy. Are you ready for your reward?" 

 "My reward?" 

 "Yes Frankie; your reward." 

 She got up on her hands and knees and said, "Do my ass Frankie; fuck me in my pooper." 

 When we were done she led me into the bathroom and washed my cock and then she went down on me for the fourth time that night, but I was done and she couldn't make anything happen. I got up and went over to my clothes and she asked: 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "Home." 

 "Oh no you don't. You are going to wake up here and then I'm going to fuck you and feed you breakfast." 

 I looked at her for a moment and then said: 

 "And Allison gets a blow by blow account of the whole thing?" 

 "What do you care?" 

 She was right. What did I care. 

 It happened like she said. I woke up and she fucked me and then fixed breakfast while I took a shower. 

 "My parents will be home sometime today so we won't be able to do it here tonight so why don't you get an air mattress for the back of your truck and pick me up somewhere around four. I'll let you take me to a movie and by then it should be dark and we can go out to the Point. Sound okay?" 

 I picked Gloria up at four and we caught the six-twenty showing at the Rialto. When the movie was over I took her to Harry's for burgers and fries. As we sat there eating and talking I saw some of Allison's friends eyeing us and I wondered how long it would take for Allison to hear about it not that I cared. 

 After eating we left and I turned right out of the parking lot and Gloria said: 

 "Where are you going? The Point is the other way." 

 "I'm not in favor of truck beds in the dark and out in the open. I got paid Friday so I've got enough for a motel." 

 Gloria was quiet for a few moments and then she said, "I'm not doing this just so I can rub Allison's nose in it and I won't even tell her if you don't want me to." 

 "I don't care if she finds out about it or not." 

 There was another silence and then Gloria said, "You aren't my first Frankie; you aren't even my tenth, but if things break right Frankie you could be my last." 

 It was my turn to be silent for a bit and then I said, "It is a little early to be talking like that. We need to know each other a lot better than we do right now." 

 I pulled into the parking lot of the Starlite Motel and told Gloria to sit tight while I got a room. Once in the room we stripped quickly and spent the next three hours repeating what we had done the previous night in her bedroom and then it was time for me to take her home. 

 "Tomorrow?" she asked when I walked her to her door. 

 "What time?" 

 "Six?" 

 "I'll be here." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had a good day at work and I was looking forward to a good evening with Gloria, but the good mood disappeared when I got home and walked into the house. My mom, Mrs. Ames and Allison were sitting on the living room couch. 

 "Oh Frankie" my mom said, "We were just talking about you. Come on Jan; lets leave the youngsters alone." 

 Mom and Mrs. Ames got up and headed for the kitchen. I looked at my watch and saw that I'd have to hurry to be at Gloria's on time. I nodded at Allison and headed off to get ready for my date. Five minutes later my mom came into the bathroom where I was shaving and said: 

 "What is wrong with you Frankie? You were rude to Allison. I know you were raised better than that." 

 "If I wanted to talk to Allison I would have called her. You and Mrs. Ames need to stop trying to push us together. I have a date tonight and I need to be there by six. I'm tight for time and I don't have any to waste on Allison." 

 "What happened to you when you went into the Army? You never used to be this way." 

 "Nothing happened to me. Allison chose to get another boyfriend while I was gone and she chose to stay with him when I got back. That was her choice. I had nothing to do with it. Now if you don't mind, I'm running late and I walked out of the bathroom, went to my room and finished dressing. When I went to leave Allison and Mrs. Ames were gone. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 I saw Gloria two or three times a week for the next three weeks and then one Wednesday when I got home from work I found Allison sitting on my front porch waiting for me. 

 "Hi Frankie. Do you have time to talk?" 

 I didn't have a date that night so I said okay. 

 "What happened to us Frankie? You don't call me anymore and you are running around with that whore Gloria." 

 "What happened to us Allison was that you took up with Tony Spears before the tail lights of my bus were out of sight. Then when I get home in time to take you to your prom like I promised -- and remember you told me you were going to hold me to that promise -- you tell me that you already have a date for the prom and it is too late for you to break it. All choices that you made Allison." 

 "But Tony means nothing to me. I needed dates for a lot of school events and you weren't here. I picked Tony because he was harmless." 

 "Horse crap Allison. In the first place you did break a date to go to the prom. You had a date with me and I came home in plenty of time to do it, but you broke that date with me and if you could break a date with me you could have broken a date with Tony. Secondly, you say he means nothing to you? He meant enough to you that you gave him your virginity. The most you ever let me do was play with your tits through your top. I never even got a hand inside your bra" 

 "That is a lie Frankie. I don't know where you got the idea that Tony got my virginity, but that is just plain bullshit!" 

 "Don't tell me Allison; tell everyone else. Tony is out there telling anyone who will listen that he popped your cherry and that you give the best blow jobs ever." 

 "He's lying! It isn't true Frankie; I swear to God it isn't true." 

 "Doesn't matter Allison. You stuck with Tony so I started seeing Gloria." 

 "She's only dating you to piss me off." 

 "It doesn't matter why she is doing it Allison; she is doing it and I'm satisfied with it." 

 "You are wrong Frankie. I did not stick with Tony after you got home. I told him I would go with him because it didn't look like you were going to be home in time, but I haven't gone out with him since the prom." 

 "Makes no difference Allison. You made your choice when I got home and you told me that you had a date for the prom and that you wouldn't break it. After I found out that you started dating Tony as soon as I was gone we were done. Anything else?" 

 "You aren't being fair Frankie." 

 "Probably not, but that's life" and I went into the house and left her on the porch steps. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the next three months, with the exception of my Guard weekends, I kept steady company with Gloria and then it was time for me to go off to my two weeks of Guard training camp. 

 It wasn't what I expected. I thought I'd be sleeping in a pup tent, crawling around in mud and going through field exercises, but what I ended up doing was taking refresher courses in my specialty. The two weeks went by quickly and then I went home. 

 As soon as I unpacked I called Gloria, but her mother said she wasn't home so I decided to run down to Harry's and see if there was anyone around that I knew. There was. Through the window I saw Allison and two of her friends sitting at a table so I got back in my truck. I decided to try the penny arcade next to the theatre and just as I was pulling into the parking lot I saw Gloria come out of the theatre with Ronny Belson. He had his arm around her and she was smiling up at him. Just then Gloria saw my truck, recognized it and shoved Ronny's arm away from her. I continued through the lot and drove on home. 

 I was not thinking good thoughts about girls. First Allison and now Gloria. I was just pulling into my driveway when my cell phone chirped. It was Gloria. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hi Frankie. When did you get home?" 

 "About three hours ago." 

 "Why didn't you call?" 

 "I did. Your mother told me that you had gone out. Have a good time with Ronny?" 

 "I was lonely and he asked me to go to the movies with him. That's all it was baby; just a night at the movies." 

 "Must have been one of those 'feel good' movies. You sure seemed to be feeling good when you came out. All smiling at Ronny with his arm around you." 

 "It was nothing baby, we were just in a good mood." 

 "If it was nothing why the quick pushing of his arm away from you? Figure that it wouldn't pass the boyfriend test? Well I've had a long day and I'm tired. I'm going to bed" and I disconnected. I didn't call Gloria the next day and she didn't call me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was home two days from training when I came home and found mom and Mrs. Ames waiting in the living room for me. 

 "Frank honey" my mom said, "Can we talk to you?" 

 "As long as it isn't about Allison." 

 "What is wrong with you Frankie?" 

 "Allison and I are done mom. I'm going with Gloria now and I have no plans on changing that." 

 "We have talked with Allison Frankie and we are sure that it is all just a misunderstanding." 

 "I said we could talk mom, as long as it wasn't about Allison" and I left the room. 

 She followed me. 

 "I won't have this! I am your mother and as long as you are living in my house you will not disrespect me by walking away from me while I'm talking to you." 

 "You are right mom and I apologize. I'll start looking for a place of my own tomorrow" and then I turned and left the house as my mom called after me, "Wait ; I didn't me..." and the closing of the door cut off the rest of what she was going to say. 

 I headed for Harry's and on the way I stopped at a newsstand and got a copy of Apartment Finders Magazine and over a cheeseburger and fries I looked for a place that I could afford. Gary Kinson came in and saw me sitting there and he came over to join me. We talked for a bit and I saw him as he kept glancing over at a table in the corner. I looked over and saw Tony Spears and a couple of other guys and looked back at Gary. He had noticed me checking and said: 

 "I was just curious. I know you were with Allison before she started going out with Tony and I wondered if there was going to be trouble and I should get out of the way." 

 It turned out that there was indeed trouble for Tony, but not from me. I was looking past Gary and saw Allison come walking in the door. She walked straight back to the table where Tony was sitting, picked up the milkshake that was sitting in front of him and poured it on top of his head as she called him a lying mother-fucker. Then she looked around the room and said loud enough for every one to hear: 

 "This worthless piece of shit is a lying mother-fucking bastard. He did not take my virginity and I have never given a blow job in my life much less one to this worthless piece of shit!" 

 By then Tony had worked his way out of the booth and had stood up which turned out to be a bad move on his part since it gave Allison a clear shot at his crotch and she rammed her knee into it. He fell to the floor and she proceeded to kick him until Harry pulled her off. She looked my way and gave me a look that clear as day said "Fuck you!" and she walked out of the place. Gary looked at me and said: 

 "I'm betting that it will be a long time before Tony talk's trash about a girl again." 

 I just shrugged. Gary got up and left and I went back to the apartment guide. I found half a dozen and I made a list of places that I could check out after work the next day. 

 I was just finishing when Gloria walked in and sat down with me. 

 "You haven't called." 

 "I didn't want to cause problems for you and Ronny." 

 "I told you; Ronny and I just went to the movies and that's all." 

 "All I can say is that it didn't look that way to me." 

 "Look baby; I told you when we first started that you weren't the first or even the tenth. Remember that?" 

 I nodded my head yes. 

 "Well Ronny was one of the first ten and we have remained friends and that's all, just friends. If you also remember I told you that if things worked out right you would be the last and you have been. I have a lot of friends Frankie, both female and male and if you are going to get bent out of shape every time I see old friends and enjoy myself around them I guess you are right in ending it between us." 

 She got up to leave and I said, "Stay Gloria. You are right. I'm sorry. My only excuse is that Allison stepped out on me when I was gone and when I got back and saw you with Ronny I said "Shit! Not again! I jumped to conclusions and I'm sorry." 

 "Want to make up? It's been two weeks for me too." 

 And we did. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day after work I went apartment hunting and I decided on the third one I looked at. It was reasonably close to work and so I put down the first and last months rent and a security deposit. 

 I went home and started to pack. My mom wouldn't talk to me and my dad asked me what was wrong. I told him that I was tired of being ambushed by mom, Mrs. Ames and Allison whenever I came home. 

 "I've told mom several times now that I'm not with Allison anymore and that I'm dating another girl, but she and Mrs. Ames are dead set on pushing me and Allison together and I'm tired of it. The only way I can see that will put an end to it is to move out on my own." 

 Dad shrugged and said, "I guess I can see your point." 

 I hit Goodwill for some furniture and moved into my new digs. It was a Friday night and Gloria's parents had gone somewhere for the weekend so Gloria spent her first night there to christen the bedroom. Saturday we christened the living room. And the dining room table. And the kitchen counter. 

 I invited mom and dad over for dinner Sunday and dad came but mom didn't. 

 "Give her time" dad said. "She's just a little upset right now." 

 "Why? I'm grown. I wasn't going to live at home forever."  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "It's just the way you left." 

 I dropped the subject. Both mom and dad knew what caused me to leave and going back to it would serve no useful purpose. Dad and I talked jobs and sports as he dried the dishes that I washed and then he said goodnight and went on home. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was the first weekend in October and I was just back from my weekend with the Guard. I was in the shop testing a unit that had just come out of assembly when I was paged to report to Mr. Backman's office. I walked into the outer office and his secretary told me to go right on in. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a tall stunningly beautiful woman. When I opened the door it blocked what was to my left and when the door closed I saw a girl sitting on a chair against the wall. She looked vaguely familiar and when she lifted her head and looked at me I saw that it was the girl from the frat party. 

 Russ stood up from behind his desk and indicating the woman he said: 

 "This is my wife Evangelina and I believe you already know my daughter Sarah." 

 "Actually I don't." 

 "Don't what?" 

 "Know her." 

 "She says otherwise. Some time back she came home one morning with a highly improbable story about where she had been. A week ago she came in to see me, saw you out in the shop and told me that you were the man she woke up with in a motel room. And you say you don't know her?" 

 "I never knew her name and as far as I know she never knew mine." 

 Mrs. Backman said, "What kind of man are you to behave like that?" 

 "Like what? I saw a situation that I didn't like, stuck my nose in it and got her out of it. I actually felt pretty good about what I did and under the same set of circumstances I would do it again." 

 "Why don't you tell us your side of it" Russ said. 

 I told them what I'd seen and what I'd done. 

 "Sarah was out of it due to whatever it was that they slipped into her drink and she was still out of it when I put her to bed. I couldn't bring her home because I had no idea where she lived, she couldn't tell me and her purse was somewhere back at the frat house. When she woke up in the morning she was terrified so we never got around to introductions. She was still leery of me when I dropped her off in front of your house. I didn't stick around because I knew I was going to be the one dumped on because I would be the only one handy." 

 There was silence and then Mrs. Backman said, "I'm sorry for what I just said" and then she walked over to me, hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. "Thank you for watching out for her." 

 I turned to Russ and asked, "Is that it?" 

 He looked at me for a couple of seconds and then said, "For now." I left the office and went back to work. 

 Twenty minutes later I saw Mrs. Backman and Sarah leaving and Sarah left her mother and walked over to me. 

 "I never thanked you for what you did for me." She handed me a piece of paper and said, "Call me" and then went back to join her mom. 

 I looked at the piece of paper and saw that it was a phone number. I looked at it, then at the retreating figures of Sarah and her mom and then I dropped it in the open top of my tool box and forgot about it. 

 That night I got the bad news. Gloria had been taking classes at the local community college and when she came over to my apartment that night she was in a great mood. 

 "Guess what?" 

 "Do I get a clue?" 

 "Why bother; you'd never guess anyway." 

 She took a piece of paper out of her purse and waved it at me. "I got accepted at Baylor. I start fall classes in two weeks." She stopped and said, "You don't seem to be too happy for me." 

 "Baylor is in Texas right?" 

 "So?" 

 "So that will pretty much kill us off." 

 "No it won't. You can come down on weekends and I'll be home on holiday breaks and stuff. Plus my dad works for an airline and I can get passes and fly home on some weekends." 

 "Be serious Gloria. I'm going to drive like hell to get there so I can spend half an hour with you and then drive like hell to get back home in time to go to work? I don't think so." 

 "We will work it out Frankie; you'll see." 

 But of course we didn't. 

 She hadn't been gone two months and I was just starting to look forward to her Thanksgiving break when she called me. 

 "I didn't want to do this in a letter, but I've hooked up with a guy here. Sorry baby; don't think bad of me. Bye baby." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The two months between Gloria leaving for school and her phone call I'd not been idle. I joined a bowling league on Friday night and was taking some night computer classes at the local community college and things had gotten really busy at work and I was putting in a lot of overtime. 

 The job was going good, but I was concerned over what might be going on in the bosses head. It always seemed that whenever I looked his way Russ was watching me. Did he not believe what I'd told him about what happened with his daughter? I felt that his wife did, but I also remembered what he'd said in his office when I finished the explanation and asked if that was it. His "For now" was said in a tone that suggested that he wasn't satisfied. I wondered if my playing the Knight in Shining Armor was going to cost me my job. 

 Thanksgiving was fast approaching and things had mellowed out a touch between mom and me. I was invited to Thanksgiving dinner with the aside that "Allison and her parents will be here." This wasn't big news because for years Mr. and Mrs. Ames and Allison had been sort of an extended family and had celebrated the holidays with us. 

 "I know you have issues with Allie" my mom said, "but there is no reason that you can't be friends." 

 On Thanksgiving I showed up at my folk's house with pies that I had picked up at the Village Inn the day before. Allison and her parents were already there. I hadn't seen Allison for a while. She was going to college and usually only came home every other weekend or so and when home she didn't seem to frequent any of the places I did. I was surprised when I saw her. Her hair was shorter and she was wearing none of the makeup that usually caked her face and she looked damned good. 

 The conversation around the table was fairly general. Mr. Ames wanted to know about my job and I told him. Mom asked Allison how her studies were coming along. Dad and Mr. Ames started talking sports and mom and Mrs. Ames talked about curtains, drapes and things like that. 

 When dinner was over the men-folk did the clean up. It was a tradition from way back. The women prepared the meal and the men did the dishes while the women retired to the living room and socialized. Dad, Mr. Ames and I talked sports until we were done and then dad and Mr. Ames went out onto the patio to smoke. I didn't smoke so I went out to the living room, but the women were talking fashion and recipes and I had no interest in that so I headed for the family room and turned on the TV. There wasn't anything interesting on worth watching except football and I had zero interest in the two teams playing and I got up to go shut off the TV. Just as I stood up Allison walked into the room. 

 "Can we talk?" she asked. 

 "I don't see why not." 

 "I'm sorry; I was wrong. You were right when you said that I should have broken my prom date with Tony when you got home. The only reason I didn't was because I didn't think that it would be fair to Tony. It was his prom too and I would have left him without a date one week from the prom. There was no way he could have come up with a date that late. It wasn't fair to you, but it wouldn't have been fair to him either I know you promised to be there, but three weeks before prom and you weren't home and I hadn't heard from you so I said yes when Tony asked me. I'm sorry; I never meant to hurt you." 

 I just looked at her for a couple of seconds as I thought about what she had said. I remembered how much going to my prom had meant to me and I knew that Allie's would have meant as much to her. And she was right. The prom was Tony's also and finding a date a week from the prom would have been damned hard if not impossible. Plus, I'd had some time to get past the whole mess. 

 "I would like to get us back to being friends." 

 "I don't have a problem with that Allie." 

 She walked over and gave me a hug and said, "Thank you." 

 She turned to go and I said, "Allie?" 

 She turned back to me and I asked, "Would you like to catch a movie with me tomorrow evening?" 

 She smiled at me and said, "Of course I would." 

 "I get off work at five so why don't I pick you up around six?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Somewhere around the middle of the movie I noticed that Allison was holding my hand and I've no idea how it happened. I started to move my arm, but her hand tightened so I let it go. By the end of the movie her head was resting on my shoulder. 

 I knew where Allison wanted to take things, but did I really want to go there? Allison and I did have something good once, but could we get back to it? Should we? I decided just to let things flow. Allie would be going back to school on Sunday so there was no time to get anything going anyway. 

 Silly me! 

 As we left the theatre Allison said, "It is still early and I don't want to go home just yet." 

 "What would you like to do?" 

 "I've never seen your apartment. Want to show it to me?" 

 Why not I thought, what could it hurt? She checked the place out and mentioned how cozy it looked. She excused herself to use the bathroom and I sat down on the couch and turned on the TV. I jumped channels for a while and then started wondering where Allison was. I got up and went to the bathroom and knocked on the door as I asked: 

 "Are you okay Allie?" 

 The door swung open to show that the bathroom was empty. Allison hadn't come back to the living room so there was only one place she could be. I walked over and looked in the bedroom and what I saw took my breath away. Allison was naked and lying in the middle of the bed. She didn't say anything, just looked up at me and waited. 

 "What are you doing Allison?" 

 "Oh come on; you can't possibly be that dense." 

 "But why?" 

 "I read your face when I told you that Tony was lying when he said he took my virginity. You thought I was lying. I figured that the only way I could prove it was to give it to you." 

 "Jesus Allie, you do..." 

 "Shut up! I always planned on giving it to you, but I always thought it would be on the night we married. That doesn't seem likely now, but I'm still going to give it to you." 

 "You ne..." 

 "Shut the fuck up and get over here!" 

 I stood there staring at her and she got an exasperated look on her face and got off the bed. She came over to me and her hands went to my belt. I didn't fight it as she worked my jeans and briefs down and my hard cock leaped up as it was freed. Allison looked up at me and said: 

 "I am a virgin, but I am not totally inexperienced. I've been fingered and I have given a hand job or two, but you are the first one to get this" and she took my cock into her mouth. 

 I had an unkind thought maybe, but I had to believe that she was telling the truth about never having had a cock in her mouth. She was terrible at it. I'd see to it that she got better at it, but that would be later. Right then I needed to get my cock out of her mouth before her teeth did some serious damage. 

 I pulled her up and pushed her back on the bed and then I went down on her. 

 "Don't do that; its nasty!" 

 I took my mouth off of her and said, "And taking my cock in your mouth isn't?" 

 I went back to what I was doing and heard no more protests, but after a couple of minutes I got a low moan and ten seconds later her fingers were in my hair and holding my head in place. After a few more minutes I moved up on Allison and did the deed. Not being very wise in the way of women and having no experience with virgins I still had to believe that Allison hadn't lied when she denied giving up her cherry to Tony. She was extremely tight and I met resistance a couple of inches in. I stopped and Allison cried out: 

 "Push damn it, push!" 

 I did, she cried out and several pushes took me all the way in. I stopped and held still and Allison said: 

 "It hurts. Oh God does it hurt, but the other girls tell me it gets better if we don't stop," 

 I started to slowly make love to her and after several minutes she moaned: 

 "Better, much better." 

 I kept going slow and soon her legs came up and she clamped my body with them. 

 "A little faster honey; a little faster please?" 

 I didn't want to go faster because it would make me cum sooner and I was afraid that I would leave Allison unsatisfied and that wouldn't be good for her first time. At least that was my thinking. Allison's hands clutched my ass cheeks and she pulled me to her as she cried: 

 "Faster Frankie, faster." 

 I gave in and started fucking her faster and harder and a minute later she moaned "Oh God," her body shook and she went limp just as I gave one last hard push and came. Concerned I started to pull away, but Allison clutched at me and cried: 

 "No, no, don't go. Just stay there; please Frankie, just stay there." 

 We lay there and she held me and after a couple of minutes or so she asked: 

 "Can we go again? How soon can we go again?" 

 "As soon as I get hard again." 

 "How long Frankie? The girls told me I should make sure to do it several times the first time. If I suck it will that make it quicker?" 

 "Probably, but you have to make sure that you don't use your teeth on me." 

 "Did I hurt you? I'm sorry Frankie; I didn't mean to. Just tell me how to do it." 

 I pulled out of her and it was then that I noticed the blood. "I guess I need to wash before we go any farther." 

 Allison looked down and said, "Oh yuck, me too" and we got up and went into the bathroom together. We showered together and then went back to the bed. Her second blow job was much better as was her third. The third was monumental in that it was totally unexpected. We had just finished making love for the second time and she wanted to go again. I decided that I would eat her pussy while I waited for 'Frankie junior' to recover. I'd only been working on her for about a minute when she twisted around and went for my cock and we ended up in our very first sixty-nine. 

 After our third session she noticed the time on the bedside clock and cried: 

 "Oh shit! I've got to get home!" 

 We hurriedly dressed and I drove her home. When I walked her to the door she said: 

 "If you pick me up earlier tomorrow we will have more time." 

 We spent Saturday and Sunday at my apartment and I was actually glad to see her go back to school. One more night with her and I might not have been able to get out of bed and go to work on Monday morning. As I dropped her at the house on Sunday she said: 

 "I'm coming back every weekend from now on. Keep them open for me." 

 As the door closed behind her I had the thought that I might have created a monster. 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© The next three weekends Allison came home and we spent seventy-five percent of that time in my apartment and a goodly portion of that time was spent in the bedroom. 

 Then it was Christmas break and Allison was home for three weeks. She was waiting at my apartment every night when I got home from work. I'm sure that my mom knew what was going on and I wondered if Mrs. Ames also knew and if the two of them were back in their wedding planner mode. 

 The week before Christmas Mr. and Mrs. Ames and Allison flew out to San Diego to visit some relative and I almost thanked God for the reprieve. Allison was flat wearing me out. She had been gone for two days and I had just gotten home from work when the doorbell rang. I answered the door and found Gloria standing there. 

 "Hi lover. Surprised to see me?" 

 "As a matter of fact I am." 

 "May I come in?" 

 I stepped back and she walked in and went over and sat down on the couch. 

 "So what brings you here?" I asked. 

 "You." 

 "Me? What happened to the guy you hooked up with at Baylor?" 

 "He turned out to be a flaming asshole. After him I dated a couple of others, but none of them measured up. I woke up to the fact that I had what I wanted and I'd let him go." 

 "What's this all about Gloria?" 

 "I'm here to ask you to give me another chance." 

 "I'm sorry Gloria, but I'm in a kind of relationship with someone." 

 "A kind of relationship? What does that mean?" 

 "I'm seeing someone." 

 "Have you proposed? Are you engaged or going steady or something like that?" 

 "No, nothing like that; at least not yet." 

 "Then I have a chance" she said as she stood up. "Can you say no to this lover?" she asked as she unbuttoned her coat, let it slip from her shoulders and fall to the floor. She was naked under the coat and had I been older and wiser I might have been able to say no, but I wasn't older and wiser and when the alarm clock woke me the next morning she was lying next to me with one arm lying across me. 

 I moved slowly so as not to wake her up and after I was on my feet I looked down at her and thought "You fucked up Frank. Allison will be back in the middle of next week and then what the fuck are you going to do." 

 Gloria was awake when I came out of the shower. While washing I thought about the situation and the more I thought about it the more I realized what I had to do. Gloria had the coffee made and as I poured myself a cup Gloria said: 

 "Tonight lover?" 

 "I don't know Gloria. It will depend on you and what you feel like doing, but you need to know up front that in six days the girl I'm seeing will be home and when she gets here she gets my time." 

 "I don't know who she is lover, but I do know that she can't possibly take better care of you than I can." 

 "Did you quit school?" 

 "Of course not." 

 "Then you will be going back to Texas as soon as the holidays are over. Last time it only took you – what? – four weeks to replace me? I can't count on you Gloria. If you want to play for the next week fine, but after that no. When you graduate and come home if we are both still single and not in solid relationships maybe we can try again." 

 "You are dumping me?" 

 "No Gloria, you dumped me. I'm just not taking you back other than as a friend with benefits. If that isn't something you can live with I guess that is your choice. I need to leave for work. You can let yourself out." 

 I put my cup in the dishwasher and headed out for another day in the salt mines. Gloria wasn't there when I got home and she didn't show up after I got home so I guessed she wasn't interested in what I proposed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The rest of the week passed by quietly and then it was Friday and the night of the company Christmas party. I debated not going, but the last five years the company had handed out bonus checks at the company party and with Christmas fast approaching and presents to buy I decided to go. I would have gotten the bonus anyway when I went to work on Monday, but if I got it that night I could put it into the bank Saturday morning and shop over the weekend. 

 I knew that Allison was going to be gone so when the sheet asking for a headcount circulated through the shop I put down that I would be attending alone. The party was being held at the downtown Hilton in one of the banquet rooms and when I got there I found a surprise waiting. Never having been to a company party before I wasn't aware that they set up tables with place cards. 

 I wandered around looking for where I was supposed to be sitting when a hand tugged on my arm. I turned and found Russ's daughter Sarah standing there. 

 "You're at our table. Its right over there" she said and she pulled me along behind her. She led me to a table where her mother and father were sitting. As we neared the table I saw Russ looking at me with an unreadable expression on his face. His wife however was giving me a beaming smile. Russ stood and shook my hand and his wife stood and gave me a hug. 

 I sat down and we socialized. The talk was general in nature with Sarah's mom doing most of it. How had I been, what was I doing, etc., etc, and then it was time to eat. It was buffet style and after we had finished eating the company CEO got up and made a speech about how proud he was of us for making XYZ the industry leader and how he hoped that we would all continue to help the company grow. Then the company president got up and said similar stuff and then he said: 

 "And now the part of the evening you have all been waiting for" and the curtains parted behind him to show a band. "I give you Johnny and The Bluetones." There was a drum roll and then the president said, "Oops, I forgot something." Another drum roll and he said, "Your section heads will take it from here." 

 Russ stood up, took some envelopes out of an inside coat pocket and then he walked around the room handing the envelopes to the men who worked for him. When he got back to the table he handed me one and I took it and put in my coat pocket. 

 "Aren't you going to look at it?" Sarah asked. 

 "Of course I will, but it would be rude of me to do it at a table of people who don't have anything of their own to open." 

 I saw her mother's lips curl in a small smile at that and I wondered what it meant. After several minutes the band began to play and Russ and his wife stood up and moved out onto the dance floor. As they walked away Sarah looked at me expectantly. I knew what she wanted so I asked her if she if she would like to dance and she smiled and stood up. As we danced she said: 

 "You never called." 

 Given the circumstances I decided that honesty would be the best policy so I said: 

 "Two reasons Sarah. The first is that I had a girlfriend and the second is from the way your father acted I don't think he believed me. I think he still thinks I took advantage of you. Working for him while he is thinking that has been difficult. I didn't need to make it worse by getting in contact with you and giving him even more to be pissed at me over." 

 "Daddy doesn't think that at all. When he came home that night he apologized for doubting me when I told him what happened." 

 "He might have apologized to you, but I still see him looking at me from time to time and I can tell from his face that he is thinking about me." 

 The song ended and I started heading back to the table, but Sarah held me back and when the next song started she moved into my arms and we started dancing again. 

 "You said you had a girlfriend. "Had" is past tense." 

 Oh oh, I said to myself; shaky ground here. Since she is the boss's daughter best be careful. 

 "It's complicated. I may or may not still have a girlfriend. I don't know. She's out of town right now and things were a little tense between us when she left. I don't know how things will go when she gets back." 

 "When is she due back?" 

 "Next week." 

 "So you might be girlfriend free come next Friday?" 

 "I have no idea." 

 "When would you know?" 

 "Again, I have no idea and I won't have one until she gets back and we talk." 

 None of it was true of course. Things hadn't been tense between me and Allie, but I didn't want to just tell the boss's daughter that I wasn't interested. God knows what she might have gone home and told daddy. 

 "I would really like to take you out to dinner some night to thank you for what you did for me. Even if you stay with your girlfriend wouldn't she understand a simple platonic 'thank you' date?" 

 "Knowing Allison as well as I do I'd have to say no; not a chance in hell." 

 Before she could say anything else the band ended the number and I started us back to the table. We no sooner sat down than Mrs. Backman said she had to make a trip to the ladies room and Sarah said she needed to go too. As they walked away Russ said: 

 "I want you to know that this wasn't my idea. This is all my wife's doing. Are you okay with it?" 

 "I'm kind of nervous about it." 

 "Why?" 

 "I haven't been in the shop as long as most of the other guys. I don't want them thinking that I'm sucking up to the boss." 

 "Yeah, I guess there is that, but we can defuse it a little." 

 "How?" 

 "Let the word get out that you are dating my daughter. That you met her at a party and dated her a couple of times before you found out she was my daughter." 

 "But that wouldn't be true." 

 "It isn't true that you are sucking up to me either. So take Sarah out a time or two and take her some place where at least one of the guys in the shop can see you." 

 I didn't say anything and after a couple of seconds he said, "Something wrong with my daughter that you don't want to be seen with her?" 

 Shit! This was getting way to out of hand. Best stick with honesty I thought. 

 "Nothing wrong with Sarah, but I already a girlfriend, but even if I didn't I'm not sure I would want to get involved with the boss's daughter. It just doesn't seem like the thing to do." 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "What if things didn't go well and she comes to you and says I've been mean to her or something like that. You will react as a father and not as my boss. I just don't think that it makes good sense to have a connection between my work life and personal life." 

 "You are probably right about that, but what you don't understand is that there are higher powers at work here." 

 "Higher powers?" 

 Before Russ could explain that one to me the women were back. Russ got up to go to the bathroom and Mrs. Backman said: 

 "My turn for a dance with you Frank." 

 We moved out onto the floor and while I tried to hold Mrs. Backman at what I thought should be the proper distance she moved right into me. 

 "My Sarah seems quite taken with you young man and I must say that for just about the first time ever I approve of her choice. When are you going to ask her out?" 

 Shit I thought, more dangerous waters. I was beginning to wish that I had minded my own business and had let Sarah be gangbanged. I liked my job and I was happy there, but Sarah's family was like a mine field. One wrong step and my job could be gone. 

 "Sarah is a nice girl and some guy will be lucky to get her, but I already have a girlfriend." 

 "Why isn't she here tonight?" 

 "She is out of town until next week." 

 "That means that you have a week with her not here. Why not spend some of that time with Sarah?" 

 "That would be cheating on my girlfriend." 

 "Oh come on Frank; you are too young to tie yourself down. You need to spend some time with other girls; make absolutely sure you find the right one for you." 

 While she was talking she was dancing close to me. I smelled her perfume and her tits touched my arm and the predictable happened and her leg came into contact with it. She raised an eyebrow and pulled back and looked at me. Then she smiled and moved back into contact and as her leg touched my third leg for the second time she said: 

 "Oh oh, now I see. My Frankie likes the older ladies. I'm flattered, but I do have to give my baby first chance and then maybe we will see." 

 Fuck me!!! I was not only in a mine field, but the fucking thing stretched out miles and miles in all directions. How the hell was I going to get out of it! But, I thought, as I watched Mrs. Backman's ass move as we walked back to the table, did I really want to? 

 I needed to get away from Sarah and her mother so when I took Mrs. Backman (please call me Vangie) back to our table I grabbed my drink and went to say hi to the other guys I worked with. I spent the next hour moving from table to table saying hello, meeting wives, girlfriends and daughters and in general steering clear of the Backman ladies. 

 A lot of guys would kill to be in my shoes right then. Both Sarah and her mother were drop dead gorgeous and radiated sex appeal and in other circumstances I wouldn't even think of running from them. But I had the perfect job for me. I loved the work, I liked my co-workers and the company had been great to me. My Christmas bonus (I looked at it when I went to the bathroom) was equal to one months pay and as far as bosses go Russ was a good man to work for. It all could be history if I got involved with Russ's daughter and anything went wrong. Russ would be husband and father first and boss second and I knew it. 

 I eventually ran out of co-workers and had to return to the table and face the Backman family. Just as I sat down Mrs. Backman and Sarah got up for another trip to the ladies' room and when they were out of earshot Russ said: 

 "Remember earlier when I said that higher powers were at work here?" 

 I nodded a yes. 

 "When you get married son you will quickly come to know what "pussy whipped" means. You can be as macho and as 'manly-man' as you want as long as you don't mind a bedroom that feels like the inside of a freezer. Or you can learn to say things like "yes dear" and "whatever you want my love" and have a bedroom like a furnace. You get my drift?" 

 "I think so." 

 "You have impressed my wife and that is no small thing when it comes to boys that Sarah shows an interest in. My wife has made it clear to me that she feels that you are a more than suitable prospect for our daughter and Sarah herself has shown quite an interest in you. My wife has asked me to use whatever influence that I have with you to get you to take Sarah out. It is one of those "Yes dear" moments. I of course can't order you to take my daughter out on a date and I will not threaten you with a piss poor performance review if you don't, but I can ask you to take her out on a date at least once or twice as a favor to me. Understand?" 

 "Yes sir." 

 The woman came back and Sarah asked her father to dance with her and as they headed for the floor Mrs. Backman smiled at me and offered me her hand. I took it and led her out onto the floor. As we danced Mrs. Backman asked: 

 "Did Russ ask you what I asked him to?" 

 "Yes he did." 

 "Are you going to do it for him?" 

 I hesitated to answer and she moved close and deliberately pushed her leg into contact with my cock which was hard as a rock and held it hard against me and said: 

 "Or maybe you'll do it for me?" 

 I gave up! I couldn't fight it any more and I pushed my cock into her and said, "Okay; I'll do it for you" and moved my hand down and squeezed her ass. She giggled and said, "Good boy Frankie; I knew I could count on you" and she kept her leg against my cock for the rest of the song. Before we could leave the floor Russ and Sarah walked up and Russ said, "Time to switch partners" and he took his wife in his arms and they danced off as Sarah moved into mine. 

 As I took her into my arms I was wondering about the contradictions Mrs. Backman had presented me with. Based on the way I'd rescued her daughter Mrs. Backman thought I was just the kind of guy she wanted for her daughter – the same guy who had said okay when she had given him a blatantly sexual (or so I thought anyway) come on. Where was the sense in that? Didn't the cock/leg push and the ass squeeze show me to be an untrustworthy asshole? And that's what she wants for her daughter? Like I said; makes no sense at all. 

 As we started moving to the music Sarah said, "Have you given any more thought to having dinner with me?" 

 "I have" I said remembering her mother's leg pressing into my erection, "and I will do it, but it has to be before my girlfriend comes back and I expect that will be next Wednesday." 

 "How about tomorrow?" 

 "Are you sure that you want to do this?" 

 "Yes I am." 

 "Okay then, tomorrow it is." 

 When the party broke up and we were leaving it just happened that I was walking out with Russ and his family. He and Sarah were several feet in front of me and Mrs. Backman was by my side. She leaned over and whispered: 

 "Thank you Frankie" and then she licked my ear and said, "I owe you one and I always pay my debts." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Thanks to Sarah and her mom – most particularly her mom – I went home with a case of 'blue balls' and was resigned to a furious session with my right hand once I got home. I was surprised to find Gloria sitting in the parking lot waiting for me. She got out of her car and walked over to me as I got out of my pickup and put her arms around me and kissed me. 

 "I'll take it" she said as she broke the kiss. 

 "You'll take what?" 

 "Your deal. Your friends with benefits deal. Can we start now? Tonight?" 

 If it hadn't been for Mrs. Backman, and to some degree Sarah, and the shape they had put me in I might have said no, but I was horny as a goat and so I didn't. Gloria wanted to make up for lost time and somewhere around four a.m. I fell asleep exhausted. 

 When I rolled out of bed at nine I smelled coffee and a trip to the kitchen showed me that Gloria was working at putting together a breakfast. She smiled when I walked in and said: 

 "I was going to wake you when I finished making the pancake batter." 

 She walked over to me and kissed me and went back to making pancakes. Over her shoulder she asked: 

 "Who is Sarah?" 

 "What?" 

 "Who is Sarah? She called about thirty minutes ago. She said figure on Delmonte's. What does that mean?" 

 "I guess that is where we are having dinner tonight." 

 Gloria gave me a look that I couldn't read and then went back to making pancakes. As she set a plate with three hot cakes on it in front of me she said: 

 "I guess I need to leave. I'm sure you won't want me here when you bring her home with you." 

 "It isn't that kind of date. She's my boss's daughter and I let myself be conned into taking her out by both her mom and dad." 

 "She attractive?" 

 "Honestly? She's hot, but it is strictly hands off. Bad things can happen to me at work if I get on the wrong side of her daddy and I don't need that." 

 "So it wouldn't upset you if I was here? I mean if your date is all that hot you might come home needing some relief." 

 "I wouldn't do that to you." 

 "Do what?" 

 "Make love to you while thinking about the girl I just left." 

 She looked at me in silence for a couple of seconds and then said, "Well there is that I guess." Another second or two of silence and then she said: 

 "I might as well get this out. I screwed up baby. I never should have started dating that asshole when I got to Baylor. I had what I wanted right here and I let it get away from me. I'm going to do whatever I have to do to get you back and that means that I need to stay close to you whenever I'm home from school and if that means I have to be your stand-by designated reliever then that is what I will be. I have a week and a half before I go back to school and I'm hoping by then I'll have you back and waiting for me to come home on weekends. Don't forget my dad works for an airline and I have pass privileges so I can easily get home. I'm going to fight for you baby. Now that I've fed you I'm going to fuck you." 

 She stood up, dropped the robe to display her naked body and then she walked to the bedroom. I wiped my mouth with a napkin and got up to follow her.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 My dinner date with Sarah was a revelation. After dinner we went to the movies. About halfway through the movie Sarah leaned over to me and said: 

 "Get me out of here. Please?" 

 I didn't think much of the movie anyway so we got up and left. Once outside the theatre I asked her what she would like to do. 

 "I want to go out to the lake and neck." 

 "You what?" 

 "You heard me. I'm tired of this pussy-footing around. I've done everything except send you an engraved invitation. Hell Frank; I've even tried using my dad to get you. Well, this isn't engraved, but it is a flat out invitation. Give me fifteen minutes out at the lake and I'll own you." 

 I was stunned! Where had the young innocent girl that I thought was Sarah gone? Fifteen minutes and she would own me? Most of me wanted to speed out to the lake and see what Sarah had to offer, but there was a small part of me that was screaming "Danger Frank, Danger!" As I stood there looking at Sarah I was thinking I was in a lose/lose situation. Take her to the lake and do what she apparently wants and her daddy finds out I'd be toast. Don't do what she wanted and she goes crying to daddy and I could very well be toast. 

 "Well?" she said as I stood there seeing my job go down in flames. Then something snapped in my head and I thought: 

 "Fuck it! If you are going down in flames anyway you may as well get something out of it." 

 I opened the door of the truck and as she got in she asked, "Where are we going?" 

 "To the lake." 

 I got in and she slid over next to me and put a hand on my leg as she said: 

 "You won't be sorry Frank; I promise you that you won't be sorry." 

 Miss Sarah was nowhere near the sweet innocent young girl that I'd thought she was. As I turned onto Hess Road Sarah's fingers found my zipper and an eighth of a mile later she had my cock in her hand and was stroking it. 

 "Surprised?" she asked. 

 "Extremely so." 

 "Why?" 

 "I don't know. I suppose it is because what little I've seen of you led me to believe that you were what some would call 'a nice girl' and nice girls don't do what you are doing." 

 "Looks can be deceiving sweetie and when it comes to being nice I can be very nice." 

 A half mile from the parking lot just off the swimming beach Sarah scooted sideways and then lowered her head into my lap. I was way past being surprised so I reached down and tripped the seat bar so the seat would move back and give Sarah more room. I pulled into the lot, parked and then leaned back and ran my fingers through Sarah's hair as she ran her tongue around my cock and moved her lips up and down on it. 

 After several minutes she took her mouth off of me and said, "I thought I would try to get the quick one out of the way so the next one would take a while." 

 "I told you I had a girlfriend." 

 "But you said she has been gone." 

 "She took very good care of me before she left." 

 "You need to know that I plan to take you away from her." 

 "Why would you say something like that? You don't even know me." 

 "I know you are the kind of guy I want. You didn't know me at all and yet you went out of your way to help me and keep me safe. That's the kind of man that all girls want. Add to that you are kind of cute and that is a package that I want. I don't know if we are a fit and can make it work, but I do want to try." 

 "And you don't think that I'm going to think that you are coming on pretty damned strong? First date and you have my cock in your mouth?" 

 "All I can say Frank is that you did not rescue an innocent young lady at that frat house. If my boyfriend of the moment hadn't gotten drunk on his ass I would have spent several hours at his apartment and he wouldn't have been my first. One of the things that I learned early on is that if you are not sexually compatible the relationship is going nowhere. I've spent months dating a guy and enjoying his company before giving it up only to find out that we were lousy in bed together. After several of those I decided to find out about the important part up front. It saves a lot of wasted time." 

 "Your boyfriend the night of the party didn't measure up?" 

 "Actually he did, but he failed the 'take care of Sarah' test when he got shit- faced and left me at the mercy of his frat brothers. Where you are concerned we already have that test out of the way." 

 "And if I fail the compatibility test?" 

 "Then I will have at least thanked you for coming to my rescue and I won't try to steal you from your girlfriend." 

 "Besides the compatibility test and the take care of Sarah test how many more tests are there?" 

 "Just one and it is a biggie, but we don't get to that one until we have been a couple for a while. Do you have a blanket for the beach?" 

 I am pleased to be able to say that, at least by my yardstick, Sarah and I were extremely compatible sexually. As I was driving her home she said: 

 "Now all I have to figure out is how to cause you and your girlfriend to break up." 

 "Only one problem with that." 

 "What?" 

 "I'm not sure that I want to break up with her." 

 "What does she have that I don't?" 

 "Don't know, but I've known her for years and I barely know you. I don't know anything about you other than you are sort of a 'free thinker' where sex is concerned." 

 "I explained that to you." 

 "I know you did, but you were explaining it from your standpoint based on your outlook and experience, but I don't see things the same way. I want to know a person a whole lot better before getting intimate. I agree that sexual compatibility is probably important, but there is a whole lot more that needs to be there for a relationship to be solid. Your way of looking at things may be valid for you, but it isn't for me. I'd have to know you a whole lot better than I do now and really like what I've learned about you before you could even come close to being my girlfriend." 

 "Then why did you let tonight happen?" 

 "Don't blame me. Tonight was your idea. You knew I was seeing someone else, but you still pushed for me to just have a thank you dinner with you. The way the night progressed is wholly on you. I made no moves to have anything other than a simple evening out with you." 

 "Then why didn't you push me away and say "Sorry, but I have to stay true to my girl" instead of letting me do what I did?" 

 "Two reasons. The first is that we are not engaged and have made no promises of fidelity to each other and the second one is that I'm a guy and I have a dick and my dick will not let me pass up free pussy." 

 "Is that all I am to you?" 

 "No, but unless something bad happens between Allie and me you won't be anyone other than a girl I have dated." 

 "No chance huh?" 

 "I didn't say that. What I said is that there isn't much chance unless Allie and I break up for some reason." 

 I pulled up in front of her house and before I could get out and get the door for her she said "Goodnight" and got out of the car and walked briskly into the house. I hoped that her dad wasn't looking out the window. The way she bailed out of the car and left me would have him asking questions that I could do with out. 

 I was going over the evening in my mind and wondering about possible outcomes, especially those that might happen at work, when I walked into my apartment. With all that I had on my mind I had totally forgotten that Gloria said that she would be waiting to take care of any blue balls I might bring home. 

 When I walked into the apartment I found her waiting on the living room couch – naked and smiling. She got up, came to me, put her arms around me and kissed me. She stepped back and said: 

 "You didn't bring it home did you? The bitch got to you. I can smell it on you." I shrugged and Gloria said, "She had better have left some for me and she took my hand and pulled me into the bedroom. 

 Luckily Sarah had left just enough. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 In the morning I woke up to a new day and with a problem that a lot of guys would have loved to have. I had three hot girls who wanted me. Allison considered me hers; Gloria was determined to take me away from Allison and Sarah had outright told me she was going to take me away from my girlfriend (that might have changed given the way she'd gotten out of my truck so God only knew what she might do) but either way I couldn't allow myself to forget who her daddy was or what he might or would do for his little girl. 

 The day did start out well. As I went to get out of bed Gloria grabbed me and pulled me down saying: 

 "We have to start the day out right baby." 

 And so we did. At ten Gloria left to go to see her parents and I figured that it would be a good time to go over and see mine. I was surprised when I walked into the kitchen and found Mr. and Mrs. Ames having coffee with my mom and dad. I hadn't expected them back until the middle of the coming week. Mrs. Ames smiled at me and said: 

 "I didn't expect to see you here this morning. I thought Allison would have you tied up for hours telling you about the trip." 

 "I haven't seen Allison." 

 "That's odd; she left to go over to your place almost forty-five minutes ago." 

 I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down and socialized for about an hour and then I got up and headed back to my place. When I got there I saw Allison's car and we both got out of our vehicles at the same time. She walked over to me and I opened my arms to hug her and was totally unprepared for the slap she delivered to my face. 

 "You miserable fucking hypocrite! You made my life a hell because I dated a guy while you were gone, but you can spend the night with that whore Gloria while I'm gone? And don't bother denying it asshole; I saw her walk out of your place this morning. Well fuck you you bastard" and she turned and stalked to her car, got in and slammed the door. She started the engine, looked my way, gave me the finger and drove away. 

 What could I say? She was right. The surprising thing to me was that I gave no thought to chasing after her and asking her to forgive me. "Oh well, I thought to myself, I still have Gloria and maybe Sarah. That thought caused my mood to darken a little. Gloria would be going back to school in a week and that would leave just Sarah and because of her father I didn't know if that would be good or bad. Then I remembered how Sarah and I had parted and I didn't know if Sarah would want to see me again or not. Merry fucking Christmas Frank! 

 The next day was Christmas and I had committed to having Christmas dinner at my parent's house and I was not looking forward to it. Mr. and Mrs. Ames would undoubtedly be there and most likely Allison would be there also. 

 I arrived early to help mom in the kitchen and found Mrs. Ames already there. She was cordial when she said "Good morning Frankie" but there was no smile on her face and that told me that Allison had talked with her. My mother was in a good mood so that told me that Mrs. Ames hadn't shared with my mom whatever Allison had told her mom. It was still going to be an awkward day. 

 Mr. Ames and Allison showed up about an hour later. I had already decided that I would let Allison set the tone. If she ignored me or gave me nasty looks I would steer clear of her, but if she was talkative I would be sociable and follow her lead. 

 Allison was cordial if a bit standoffish so I only spoke when spoken to which wasn't all that often. We had dinner and then retired to the family room where the tree was set up for the giving of gifts. Allison opened the gift I'd placed under the tree for her, glanced at the pearl necklace that had cost me a weeks pay, and then set it aside without a word. I saw the look on the face of Mrs. Ames and I knew that Allison was going to catch hell as soon as she got home for not even offering a simple thank you. 

 After Allison and her parents had gone home my mom said, "You and Allison having problems?" 

 "Some." 

 "Bad problems?" 

 "As far as she is concerned. While she was gone I dated another girl and she's mad at me because of it." 

 "I would have been too if I was her. Boyfriends shouldn't do things like that." 

 "I'm not engaged to Allison. Technically we are not even going steady; we just date each other a lot. And unlike you and Mrs. Ames I have not decided that Allison is the girl I should spend the rest of my life with. While I am single I'm going to see what else is out there and if Allison doesn't like it that's just too bad. She is free to do the same." 

 Mom gave me one of those "Whatever am I going to do with you" looks and got up and went into the kitchen. 

 When I got back to my apartment I found Gloria waiting for me. She was sitting on the couch naked except for a pair of heels and a big red bow tied around her waist. 

 "I've been waiting baby; come here and unwrap your present." 

 I spent the rest of the weekend lounging around the apartment with Gloria and making frequent trips to the bedroom. We talked and she kept insisting that she was determined that we were going to be a couple and she kept pushing for me to give her a token that she could take back to school with her; something that would show that we were going steady. I told her what I'd told her before; that if neither of us was in a committed relationship when she got out of school we could give it a try. 

 "You are going to be gone for the better part of the next two years and I know your sexual appetite and I know that you are not going to go without. The chance of me getting another one of your phone calls is too great. If I'm not with someone when you come back to town on the weekends and school breaks I'd love to keep you company, but that is as far as I'm willing to commit." 

 "Not even if I promise to come to come home every weekend??" 

 "That's only two days Gloria. There are still the other five and I don't think you can stay away from the guys that I know will be constantly hitting on you. You can say that you won't have anything to do with them and you might even mean it when you say it, but I don't think you can do it. To be absolutely honest about it I'm not sure that I wouldn't be tempted to see other girls while you are gone. Better for both of us to keep our options open." 

 "I'm still going to come back every weekend." 

 "Then I'll keep the weekends open, but I'm not making any promises over how I'll spend the week." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday was a busy day at work and I didn't notice any change in my boss's behavior toward me. The surprise came when I got off work. I walked out to the parking lot and found Sarah sitting on the tailgate of my truck. She stood up as I approached and said: 

 "Hi." 

 "Hi yourself." 

 "I'm here to apologize for the other night." 

 "No apology necessary." 

 "Yes there is. You were up front with me right from the beginning about seeing another girl. I had no right to get pissy when you reminded me of it." 

 "I wasn't exactly being the 'true blue' boyfriend if I remember the evening rightly. I suppose you did have some right to expect a little something after what we did." 

 "Can we start over? I mean can we be friends? I know you have a girl right now, but can we be friends?" 

 "I don't see why not. Want to get a cup of coffee?" 

 "Yes, I'd like that." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Gloria had to return to school on the 29th so she did her best during the four days after Christmas to fuck me to death. The week was pretty much work, go home and deal with Gloria and try to get some sleep. 

 Twice during the week Sarah came to visit her father at work and both times 'just happened' to be at lunch time and both times it 'just happened' that Russ couldn't get away so Sarah asked me to join her for lunch and I did. 

 I'd not seen or heard from Allison since Christmas day. I hadn't tried calling her because there was nothing I could say. She had been right. I was a hypocrite. I did shun her for dating while I was away for training and I did get with Gloria when Allison was gone. I had done exactly what I had been pissed at her for doing. I had no defense. 

 What I did have was a New Years party to go to and no date. Gloria would be gone and Allison wasn't talking to me. The solution occurred to me during my second lunch with Sarah. I asked her if she had plans for New Year's Eve and she said no so I asked her out and she said yes. 

 The night of the party I showed up at the Backman house to pick up Sarah and when I rang the doorbell it was Sarah's mother who opened the door. I went instantly hard. She was dressed and ready to go to a party and she was stunning! A fairly low cut 'little black dress' that showed some mind boggling cleavage and ended just high enough to show off her fabulous legs. High heels made of thin leather straps completed the outfit and I forgot myself and muttered "Wow!" Mrs. Backman beamed and said, "Why thank you young man." 

 She stepped aside and told me to come in. She led me into the living room and told me to have a seat on the couch. She sat down on the easy chair across from the couch, crossed her legs and said: 

 "Sarah is still getting ready and Russ is in the shower. I'm so glad that you are taking Sarah out." 

 I heard her words, but I barely processed them since most of my attention was on the sexy leg display in front of me. Mrs. Backman laughed and said: 

 "Maybe we should switch dates. Let Sarah go with her dad and I'll go with you." 

 I tore my attention away from her legs and moved my gaze toward her face and said "Ma'am?" 

 She laughed again and said, "Russ doesn't look at me like that any more. I like it. I could stand an evening of it." 

 I blushed and she said, "Don't get all flustered on me Frank. It's natural. A woman loves to hear compliments and she loves to see them too" as her gaze fell to the tent in my trousers. 

 I sat there looking at the sexy display, but was saved from saying anything stupid by Sarah coming into the room. She looked like a carbon copy of her mother in her LBD and heels. The difference was that Sarah's mom radiated an earthy sexiness whereas Sarah's aura was more of an innocent sexiness. I had to admit to myself that if given a choice as to who I wanted that night mom would have won hands down. And mom knew it! I could see it in her eyes. 

 As soon as we were in the truck Sarah slid over next to me and put her hand on the lump in my trousers. 

 "Mom got to you huh? She does have that effect on guys." 

 I of course said, "Don't be silly" and Sarah laughed. 

 "You're a guy Frank and it is only natural. I just hope that I have the same effect on you when I get to be her age." 

 I turned and looked at her and she said, "That's right Frank; I expect us to be together twenty years from now." 

 "You can't be serious." 

 "Of course I am. You passed the compatibility test and the take care of Sarah test. I am sure that you are the one Frank. I know we haven't known each other all that long, but I'm pretty sure that you are the one I'm looking for. All I have to do is make it happen." 

 "I thought there was another test I had to pass. When do I find out what it is?" 

 "When it happens." 

 "I don't get a clue?" 

 "Nope. It will happen on its own and when it does I'm pretty sure that you will pass it. No more talking about it. We are out to have a good time tonight, not plan our future. Tonight is dance, dance, dance." 

 We had a very good time for the first hour of the party and then it turned a bit sour. Allison showed up at the party. Seeing her there with a date didn't bother me and there was no reason why it should have, but it soon became apparent that Allison's purpose was to try and get me pissed. She plastered herself to her date on the dance floor and ground her body into her partner and he responded by dropping his hand to her ass and pulling her tight against him. Allison looked at me and gave me a nasty smile.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© After about a half hour Sarah asked me, "Why is that tramp constantly looking at you?" 

 "Remember back to the time when you said that surely my girlfriend wouldn't mind you and I going out for a simple thank you dinner?" 

 "Yes, and you said something to the effect that there wasn't a chance in hell that she wouldn't mind." 

 "Well she certainly did get pissed when she found out I'd dated another girl while she was gone (of course I didn't tell Sarah that the girl was Gloria) and she called me a rotten bastard and hasn't spoken to me since." 

 "So?" 

 "That's her and I guess she is speaking to me now." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "The way she is behaving in front of me is her saying "Fuck you Frank." She keeps looking at me to make sure I'm not missing the show she is putting on." 

 "Okay then; as long as she keeps looking at us I think we need to put on a show of our own." 

 She moved in tight against me and said, "Put your hands on my ass lover" and then she pulled my head down and kissed me. Her tongue darted into my mouth and out of the corner of my eye I saw the nasty smile disappear from Allison's face to replaced by a pissed off look. I smiled inwardly and returned Sarah's kiss with a little tongue of my own. 

 For the rest of the evening I kept my back to Allison so I didn't see anything she was doing. When the count down to midnight came Sarah moved in tight against me and at the stroke of midnight she gave me a kiss that should have melted the nails in my shoes. When she broke the kiss she said: 

 "I want to get out of here Frank. We need to get somewhere where we can start the New Year out the way it should be. Take me to a motel." 

 As we left I saw Allison starring at me and if looks could kill I'd have been a corpse. 

 I headed toward my apartment as Sarah slid over next to me and unzipped my pants and worked my cock out into the open. She stared at it for a second or two and then she bent and took it in her mouth. About halfway to the apartment I thought better of going there. Sarah didn't know where I lived and once she found out she might take it in her mind to drop by from time to time and if Gloria had meant what she said when she told me that she was going to come home every weekend I didn't need Sarah and Gloria running into each other. 

 I hung a right on Wilcox and headed for motel row. There were nine motels on Wilcox between Baker and Union and the first six I came to had the "No Vacancy" signs lit so I pulled into the seventh. Once in the room Sarah said: 

 "I'm not an easy slut Frank. What I am is a girl who goes after what she wants and when I go after it I go full speed ahead." 

 As she spoke she undressed and I stood there and watched. 

 "Come on Frank; get a move on. I don't want to be the only naked one in the room." 

 I hurriedly undressed and then the night got physical – extremely physical. Sarah blew me and then pulled me on top of her and after we both came we went sixty-nine until I was hard again. Then it was doggie followed by another blow job followed by cowgirl. 

 It was a quiet Sarah who sat next to me in the truck as I pulled up in front of her house. I got out, opened her door and walked her to her front door. She turned to me and said: 

 "I will see you again, won't I?" 

 "Of course you will" I said and she came up on her toes and kissed me. 

 "Call me. Soon" she said and went into the house. 

 When I got to the apartment I undressed and fell into bed exhausted. 

 The doorbell ringing woke me up and I glanced at the bedside clock and saw that it was just after eleven and I wondered who would be at my door on New Year's day. I got up, put on my robe and walked to the door and opened it just in time to see Allison's car pull out of the parking lot. I shrugged and started to close the door and then noticed a paper bag sitting just in front of it. I bent down and looked inside and saw several pieces of cloth. I carried the bag to the kitchen table and dumped the contents of the bag on it. There was a pair of thong panties, a pair of thigh high nylons and a brassiere and they were all cum stained. I picked them up to toss them into the trash and underneath them I found four filled and tied off condoms. It seems that Allison had found a rather unique way of saying "Fuck you!" I looked at the pile and then shrugged. I had to admit that I deserved it. 

 

 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© The next week was a quiet one as far as having females in my life was concerned. All the girls had gone back to school so it was pretty much work, go home, watch some TV and read books. It did not come as a surprise when Gloria ("I'm coming home every weekend from now on") didn't show up, but I was kind of surprised when Sarah didn't, especially after telling me that she was going to do a full court press to land me. 

 Allison did come home and she made sure that she and her date (not the same guy from New Year's Eve) showed up everywhere I went that weekend. I think it pissed her off when I ignored her. I don't know who did what the following weekend because that was the weekend I owed the Guard and I wasn't around. 

 I had some time to think during that weekend and I decided that what I needed to do was pick one girl and stay with her regardless of whether she was in town or away at school. Allison was out. She was busy rubbing my nose in what she was doing, not that I didn't deserve it, but I just wasn't built right to allow myself to crawl to her and beg forgiveness. I did what I did and it was wrong, but it was also a done deal and couldn't be changed. 

 That left me with a choice between Gloria or Sarah and I didn't trust Gloria not to do what she had done when she first went off to Baylor. The process of elimination brought me down to Sarah, but did I want to go there? The fact that she was the boss's daughter meant that there was always going to be the possibility of danger if the relationship went wrong. Maybe the wise thing to do would be to date some others and find someone new. On the other hand, turning away from Sarah could promote the same danger that a relationship with her going bad could cause. It was another one of those "Damned if you do; damned if you don't" situations. 

 Sarah was smart, sexy and seemed to really want something to happen between us. I liked her a lot, but the question was could I come to love her. Gloria was also smart, sexy and had said she wanted me and I did like her a lot, but there was the trust issue (look at me – talking about trust!). My feelings for Allison were strong; stronger than my feelings for either Gloria or Sarah, but I wasn't at all sure that those feelings were love. 

 Shit!!! Why couldn't life be simple? 

 In the end I took the coward's way out. I wouldn't do anything and just wait. I'd do the equivalent of flipping a coin. The first one to make the move would be the one I would go with. Allison and Gloria had a slight edge because they both knew where I lived and Sarah only had my phone number, but Sarah had the option of showing up where I worked if only to say hi to daddy. All three knew where I usually spent my free time so all I was going to do was follow my usual pattern which was basically go to work, go home, and on some nights go out to my favorite haunts. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 It was the fickle finger of fate that did it. It was a Friday afternoon and an hour before quitting time when Russ called me into his office. 

 "I need a favor Frank." 

 "Sure boss; what do you need?" 

 "Sarah was on her way home for the weekend and her car broke down just outside of town. She called me to come and get her, but I have a meeting with Phelps (CEO of the company) in ten minutes. I've made arrangements to have the car taken care of. Can you go and get her?" 

 "Of course I can." 

 He told me where she was and told me to go ahead and take off and he would sign me out at the end of my shift. When I got there Sarah was standing next to her car watching a tow truck hook up to it. When she saw me pull up she got a big smile on her face and hurried over to me. She got in the pickup, slid over next to me, gave me a big kiss and said: 

 "This worked out better than I expected." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "I was trying to get to the plant so I would be there when you got off work. I tried calling you last night to let you know that I was coming, but I kept getting a wrong number so I thought my best bet would be to catch you at work." 

 "Your dad must have ESP because he grabbed me and asked me to come and get you." 

 I took her back to the plant and turned her over to her father after making arrangements to pick her up later to take her out to dinner 

 And from that point on Sarah and I were a couple. 

 When I arrived at six her mother met me at the door. My cock went instantly hard as she stood in front of me in a tank top and a pair of white shorts. She obviously wasn't wearing a bra and she also obviously knew that I was coming. Was it intentional? If so, why? I remembered the way she had acted at the Christmas party and again when I had picked Sarah up for the New Year's Eve party and I wondered what was up with that. 

 "Sarah will be down in a minute Frank. How have you been?" 

 Before I could say anything Sarah came down the stairs. She told her mother that she might be late and as I helped her into her coat I saw her mother looking at the tent in my trousers. She looked up, saw me looking at her and she smiled at me and licked her lips. Needless to say that when we left I was already primed for what I expected to be doing with Sarah before the night was over. 

 After dinner I asked Sarah what she would like to do and she said, "I want to see your apartment especially the bedroom and the sooner the better." 

 When we got there I found a note taped to the door and I opened it and read: 

 "I was here; where were you? Call you in the morning" and it was signed "Gloria." 

 "What's that?" Sarah asked. 

 "A note from a neighbor saying he has a package UPS left for me. I'll get it in the morning." 

 It was nasty of me, but I had occasional thoughts of her mother as I made love to Sarah for the first time that night, but Sarah burned those thoughts out of me with the second and third times and she barely left me with enough energy to drive her home. As I pulled up in front of her house she said: 

 "Next weekend I won't tell my parents I'm coming home and I can spend the whole weekend with you." 

 She kissed me goodnight, told me she would see me Saturday afternoon and went on into the house. 

 I woke up to the jangle of the phone and as I reached for the bedside cordless I saw the digital read-out on the clock. It was only eight o'clock and I wondered who the hell would be calling me so early. It was Gloria. 

 "Just calling to make sure that you are there before coming over." 

 "Don't bother coming over Gloria. I'm going to be busy all weekend. In fact I'm going to be busy every weekend from now on." 

 "What? What do you mean?" 

 "I'm dating a girl and she is keeping me pretty busy." 

 "Why? I told you that I would be coming home on weekends." 

 "You told me every weekend, but I don't believe I've seen you since you went back to school on the 29th." 

 "I'm sorry Frank; something came up and I couldn't make it." 

 To me that meant that she hadn't come back during my duty weekend either, but she didn't know that. 

 "Does that something just happen to have a male name attached to it?" 

 "It wasn't like that Frank." 

 "No matter. You weren't here so I went out by myself and while I was out I met a girl and we clicked." 

 "That's not fair Frank." 

 "Hey, I'm not the one who made promises and then didn't keep them. Got to go. I have to get ready to go pick her up. Take care Gloria" and I hung up. 

 I looked at the clock again and then rolled over and went back to sleep. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next three months took on a sameness. Work during the week and Sarah every weekend. One weekend out of three Sarah would come home and stay with her parents and I would pick her up there for our dates and then take her home. The other two she came straight to my apartment and never let her parents know she was in town. 

 I took up bowling to give me something to do on Wednesdays and I started taking evening classes at the community college. I was happy with my job, but the longer I was there the more I saw that if I wanted to move up in the company I was going to need more than just being technically proficient. I started taking business classes and I was even thinking of going all the way and getting an Associate's Degree in Business Management. 

 My weekends with Sarah boiled down to dinners, movies, occasional parties thrown by either her friends or mine and a lot of time in my bedroom. Some nights we just stayed in and played cards. I could whip her almost every time we played cribbage, but she got back at me when we played gin. It was almost as if she could get inside my head and use my eyes to see what cards I was holding. 

 One constant was that on the weekends Sarah stayed with her parents and I rang the bell when picking her up her mother was always the one who came to the door. And her mother always seemed to flirt with me and sometimes that flirting almost seemed like she was actually coming on to me. 

 There was another constant. It didn't matter what parties we went to Allison would either be there or would show up shortly after we got there. It had to steam her that I just ignored her. 

 Sarah and I eventually reached the point where we were starting to discuss our future. Sarah was working on a degree in education and she intended to be a school teacher when she graduated. She didn't want to get married until after she graduated, but she thought that it was time to start to prepare her mother. When I asked why she said the more time her mother had to plan the wedding the better and while Sarah didn't say it outright telling me that it was time to prepare her mom was also her way of telling me that it was time for me to shit or get off the pot. I knew what she was saying so during the week while she was in school I picked out a ring and that Friday evening when she came home I proposed. 

 Of course telling her mother also meant telling mine. 

 I'd taken Sarah home to meet my parents and while my dad gave me a big smile and a 'thumbs up' my mom wasn't as enthusiastic. She was cordial, but it was obvious that she was disappointed in me and I knew it was because I wasn't with Allison. Telling my mom that I was now engaged, and not to Allison, was difficult for me. Mom took it like I expected. I could tell she wasn't happy, but she accepted it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two weeks after Sarah informed her parents I had a visitor. It was on a Monday about an hour after I had gotten home from work. The door bell rang and when I opened the door Mrs. Backman was standing there. She was wearing a mini-skirt, a low cut blouse and four inch heels. I went instantly hard. 

 "Surprised honey? Going to invite your future mother-in-law in?" 

 I stepped aside and she walked in. She walked over to the couch and sat down and patted the cushion next to her in invitation. I sat down and she gave me an appraising look for a couple of seconds and then she said: 

 "You are probably wondering why I am here; am I right?" 

 I nodded a yes. 

 "Like most mothers I want what is best for my baby. Sarah thinks that is you, but Sarah is young and impressionable. As a concerned mother I need to be sure that she isn't making a mistake. You do understand that, right?" 

 I nodded a yes. 

 "You know what I've learned over the years? I've learned that you can trace the reason for marriages that fail to the bedroom." 

 As she was saying this she leaned toward me and her blouse gaped open a bit and I saw that she wasn't wearing a bra. My cock was threatening to rip through my pants. In a breathy voice she said: 

 "I don't want my daughter's marriage to fail Frank honey and the best way to see that it won't is to make sure she gets the right man." 

 She put her hands on my head and pulled me toward her. Her lips touched mine and her tongue darted into my mouth. Her hands let go of my head and went around me and she kept her lips against mine as she pulled us closer together and when we were chest to chest her right hand went down to the tent in my pants. She stroked the tent pole a couple of times and with her tongue working in my mouth her hands went to my belt buckle and then my zipper. As one hand worked my cock out into the open the other took my right hand and carried it up under her skirt. Not only was she not wearing a bra, she didn't have on any panties. She got my hand against her pussy and then let go of it. I knew what was expected of me and my fingers went to work. 

 Did I think of Sarah as all this was happening? Sarah who? Mrs. Backman had my cock out and pointed at the ceiling. She ran her hand up and down it a couple of times and then she broke the kiss, swung over me and guiding me with one hand she sat down on my cock. 

 "Oh yeah Frankie baby" she moaned as she took me in, "Fuck me baby, fuck your mommy in law." 

 I pushed up, but I didn't fuck her – she fucked me! She rode me up and down and the entire time she moaned in my ear: 

 "Fuck me baby, fuck me, fuck mommy, do mommy good baby, oh yeah Frankie baby, fuck mommy." 

 Her mouth found mine and her tongue fucked my mouth while she fucked herself on my cock. I'd spent the weekend with Sarah trying to fuck me to death and it hadn't been eighteen hours since she went back to school so it was taking 'mommy' a long time to get me off, but I didn't think getting me off really mattered to her. She was getting off and I was guessing that is all that really mattered. She got me to where I needed – really needed – to get my nut so I pushed her off me and she screamed: 

 "What are you doing? Fuck me damn you, fuck me!" 

 I pulled her down on the floor and onto her back. I moved between her legs and pushed into her cunt and then I pounded her. I was nailing her hard and fast and she was crying, "Oh yes, oh God yes, fuck me fuck me fuck meeee..." 

 I did and I did it as hard as I could. 

 "Oh yes baby yes; fuck mommy baby, fuck mommy." 

 I was on the ragged edge of cumming, but was still in control enough to say: 

 "I'm gonna cum; are you protected?" 

 "In me baby, I want it in me. Cum in mommy baby, cum in mommy." 

 As I pumped my sperm into her I had a weird thought. What if she wasn't protected and I got her pregnant and then married her daughter and got her pregnant right away. Wife and mother-in-law carrying my babies at the same time. How far out would that be? 

 When I was drained I started to pull out, but Mrs. Backman clutched me and held me in place as she worked at catching her breath. Finally, when I was a soft as a cooked noodle, her arms and legs fell away. I got up and looked down at her as she looked up at me. She smiled. 

 "Not bad baby, not bad at all. Surprised to find out your new mommy-in-law is a cock loving slut?" Before I could answer she said, "Of course you aren't. You knew it when you pushed your cock into my leg at the Christmas party and I didn't pull away. The question is can you handle the two of us? Sarah and me?" 

 She got up on her knees and reached for my soft cock. It twitched as her hand wrapped around it and she giggled. "I think it likes me. I think it likes mommy." She leaned forward and took me in her mouth. A she licked and sucked on me I had another weird thought. If Allison and I had stayed together would Mrs. Ames ever do to me what Mrs. Backman was doing? 

 "Mommy" got me up again and then said, "Can we try a bed for the next one?" 

 As she slipped her clothes back on she said, "Russ bowls on Monday and Thursday and on Wednesday he goes to meetings of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. I have to be home to have dinner ready for him, but I'll be here by six-thirty. Now give mommy a kiss." 

 She tried to touch the backside of my belly button with her tongue and then she was out the door and gone. 

 When she was gone I poured myself a stiff drink and sat down on the couch. As I sipped the drink I thought over what had just happened. There was no denying that Vangie (she told me that she was either Vangie or 'mommy' to me when we were alone) had turned me on from the day we met, but never in my wildest dreams, fantasies or flights of imagination had I ever expected what had just happened to occur. And if I understood correctly what she had said it was going to happen again on Wednesday and Thursday. Oh man! 

 As I finished my drink I had another thought. As much as I had sweated over what Russ might do to me because of his daughter now I had to sweat over his wife too. But damn! The woman was a major turn on and superb pussy. 

 And there was one more disturbing thought as I lay in bed staring up at the ceiling trying to fall asleep. It was the realization that I was a dyed in the wool asshole. I had screwed Gloria while Allison was gone; I had screwed Sarah while Gloria was gone and now I had screwed around on Sarah behind her back and with her own mother no less. Add to that I was also stabbing my boss in the back by fucking his wife. I fell into a troubled sleep. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Tuesday morning as I was walking to my test bench Russ stuck his head out of his office and said: 

 "I need to see you Frank." 

 Can you say panic? He knew! 

 He knew what had happened at my place the previous night. I hesitated. If I went into his office the best he could do was fire me and the worst would be killing me. I thought of running for the door and avoiding either outcome, but then I thought "You might be an asshole Frank, but you don't have to be a cowardly one." I took a deep breath and then went into his office to face him. 

 Russ pointed at a chair and told me to take a seat. I sat down and looked at him. He sat on the other side of his desk looking at me and the one thing that registered was that there was no anger in his face. I didn't see any murderous intent. 

 "You have been a good technician Frank and I hate to lose you, but, and I'm sure that you will understand, we just can't work together any more." 

 I was amazed at how calm he was taking it. I went bananas over Allison just dating another guy when I was gone and here was Russ being calm even though I had fucked both his wife and his daughter. I sat there waiting for him to tell me to go to personnel and pick up my final check when he said: 

 "You have some time yet before you have to make your move. The Policy and Procedures Manual doesn't say anything about relatives working for the company it only says that a relative can't work under the supervision of another relative and we won't be related until you and Sarah are actually married so you have months yet to go through job postings on the company's internal website to find something that you might want to put in for." 

 Sweet Jesus!! He didn't know! Relief flooded through me as he went on: 

 "I figure that by telling you now you will have some time to pick and chose instead of having to take what's there when the wedding comes and you have to move." 

 Feeling a whole lot better knowing that I wasn't going to be fired or killed I jokingly said; 

 "Or I can stay here and you can change jobs. You would make a good division manager or go big and try for VP." 

 "Wise ass. Get out of here and get to work." 

 The day flew by and I don't think I got much out of my classes that night because I wasn't thinking of much other than Vangie and wondering if she would actually come to my place again on Wednesday. 

 Wednesday was a difficult day for me. I had a lot to do during the day and I tried to get it done without looking at the clock every five minutes to see how closer I was to quitting time. Would Vangie really come over? I half wished that she wouldn't and half prayed that she would. It was a weird feeling wanting and not wanting at the same time. I knew I was flirting with disaster if by some chance we were ever found out and God knew I didn't want that, but she was a woman – a sexy, beautiful woman – and she wanted me! Why? I had no idea, but the fact that she did made me feel like the world's greatest stud. Vangie could have had any man that she wanted and she could have gotten him with the mere crook of a finger, but she wanted me! I know I was cheating on Sarah, but I didn't care. Sarah was a beautiful and sexy young girl, but Vangie was a WOMAN!  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 03 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I was first in line at the time clock for the first time since I had been hired and I left the parking lot like I was competing in the Daytona 500. When I got home I showered, put on some cologne that I had gotten on my birthday or maybe at Christmas but had never worn and then put on a robe and waited to see if Vangie would show up. 

 As I sat waiting I suddenly remembered that I was supposed to go bowling. I dug around until I found the number for my team captain and called him to let him know I couldn't make it and that he would need to find a substitute for me. 

 I sat down in front of the TV and flipped through channels while watching the clock. Finally at six-twenty the doorbell rang and I rushed to the door and opened it to find Vangie standing there in low cut top, mini skirt and four inch 'come fuck me' heels. As I took in the instant hard on generating sight I would have bet my next paycheck that there was no bra or panties under the outfit. 

 "Hi baby" she said as she walked into the apartment, "Are you ready for mommy?" 

 I no sooner closed the door and she had me in her arms and her tongue was pushing at the back of my throat. I returned the kiss and when she ran her hand down my stomach and started to rub my hard cock I slid a hand inside her top and began rolling a nipple between my fingers. She broke the kiss and said: 

 "Oh you naughty boy. When guys play with my tits it makes me think they want to do nasty things to me. Do you want to get nasty with mommy?" 

 "I want to fuck mommy. Right now! Here!" 

 Vangie laughed and got down on the floor in front of me. She pulled her skirt up and I saw that I had been right about her not wearing panties. I've always been turned on by nylons, garter belts and high heels, but just then I thought Vangie's bare legs and four inch come fuck me's were the sexiest thing ever. 

 "Come on baby, kiss it. Kiss it and then you can fuck it." 

 I stood there looking down at her as I let my robe fall from my shoulders to the floor and she whispered: 

 "Hurry baby, hurry. Mommy needs it. Mommy needs it bad." 

 I got down and kissed her pussy and then I licked it. 

 "Oh yeah baby; eat mommy's pussy. Eat mommy baby, eat mommy." 

 I licked and sucked her pussy until she moaned, "Now baby, now. It's time to fuck mommy." I moved up and lanced into her and she cried out, "Fuck yes! Fuck mommy baby, Fuck mommy hard." 

 She had at least one orgasm before I came and as soon as I was out of her she had me in her mouth. As soon as she had me hard she panted: 

 "Bed! Now!" 

 We fucked three times before she had to leave and I honestly didn't want her to leave. I wanted her to say "I'm yours from now on and I'll never leave you" even though I knew it was the biggest of all pipe dreams. I got one last hot kiss before she left with: 

 "Same time tomorrow baby. Be ready for mommy. We don't want to waste time on unnecessary things like undressing. Mommy's got something special in mind for you tomorrow baby. Take your vitamins." 

 I almost told her that we couldn't get together tomorrow because I had class, but then I decided that I would cut classes for another night with Vangie. 

 When she arrived Thursday night I greeted her naked. She was dressed the same as the previous night and she went from the front door straight to the bedroom and I followed along behind her like an eager little puppy. She shed her top and mini skirt and got down on the bed. 

 "Come here baby; lick mommy's pussy and get mommy ready." 

 I did it and worked on her for several minutes and then she got up on her hands and knees. 

 "You know what mommy wants baby. Do it; give mommy what she wants." 

 I fucked her hard and gave her two orgasms before I came and then she spun around and took me in her mouth. When I was hard again she told me to hand her her purse from the dresser. She took something out of the purse and handed it to me. It was a bottle of KY Lotion. 

 "Mommy wants her butt fucked baby" and she got back on her hands and knees. Using the KY I worked on her butt hole until I could work two fingers into her easily and then I lubed my cock and pressed against the target. 

 "Do it baby, do it! Fuck mommy's ass. Push your hard cock into mommy's tight ass." I worked it in as she moaned, "Yeah baby, yeah. Push baby, fuck mommy's ass. Fuck mommy's tight ass." 

 I buried a load in Vangie's butt and then she took me into the bathroom, washed my cock and then got down on her knees and sucked me hard again. The last time was missionary with her legs up on my shoulders and with her screaming at me to "Fuck mommy." 

 As she was getting ready to leave she said, "Russ has something going on this Saturday and I may be able to get over here for a couple of hours. Will you be home?" 

 Sarah would be coming home on the weekend and her parents still didn't know that she came home every weekend so I said: 

 "I have something going all weekend and I won't be home until late Sunday." 

 "And you won't give it up even for mommy?" 

 "I can't; not on such short notice." 

 "Maybe next weekend?" 

 "Sarah will be home that weekend." 

 "Oh pooh! I guess you will just have to take a lot of vitamins so you can keep up with me on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday." 

 I'd already made up my mind to give up bowling if Vangie was going to keep coming over, but I couldn't give up classes. I was two thirds of the way through the courses and too close to being finished to drop out so I took a deep breath and said: 

 "I can't do Thursday, at least not until the end of this term. If I dropped out now I'd lose the tuition and the credits." 

 She gave me a look that I couldn't decipher and then she left without another word. I wondered if she would be back or if I'd just had the last of her fantastic pussy and tight butt. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Friday morning Russ called me into his office. "About what we talked about earlier; you know, having to change jobs? I was having lunch with John Corkle yesterday and he told me he has an opening in Division Three that he hasn't posted yet. I told him about you and our problem and he said to send you over to see him." 

 I went and saw Corkle and then I went back to my work area and told Russ that I had the job and told him that Corkle said that he would call Russ and discuss the mechanics of the transfer. At four Russ told me that I would start work in Division Three on Monday and he wished me luck. 

 

 

 When I got home from work I found Sarah waiting for me and I thought that maybe it was time to give her a key. She was hungry so I took a quick shower and we went out to get a bite to eat. After a leisurely meal we went back to the apartment and watched some TV until she reached over and ran her hand up my leg. I took her by the hand and led her into the bedroom which is pretty much where we stayed except for meals showers and a little card playing until she left for school on Sunday. 

 Monday I was in the middle of fixing myself some dinner when the doorbell rang. It was Vangie and she was dressed in what I had come to call her "slut suit" which was a low cut top, mini skirt and CFMs. She walked in and said: 

 "You aren't ready for me baby?" 

 "To be honest I didn't expect you to be here." 

 "And why would you think that?" 

 "The rather cool look you gave me and the way you left when I said I couldn't do Thursday or the weekend." 

 "Of course I was upset baby. You said no to mommy and mommy doesn't take rejection well. Why do you still have your pants on?" 

 "Let me turn off the stove and I'll correct that." 

 Vangie stayed until ten and when she left I was famished. Keeping up with her helped me work up an appetite and as I ate I wondered about Vangie and what was going on. Why was she doing it? I know what she told me the first time, but if that was true why was she still doing it after finding out I could perform well enough to be suitable for her daughter? And how long did she intend to keep on doing it? To be honest I wouldn't mind if she never stopped. To be brutally honest if she wasn't married and I had a choice between Vangie or Sarah I'm sure that I would have gone with Vangie if she wasn't a cheater. Even though I was young and not all that worldly I'd still heard that "Once a cheater always a cheater." 

 And then I stopped and pondered that. What did that say about me? I'd cheated on Allison and now I was cheating on Sarah. Did that mean I would always cheat if the opportunity presented itself? Was I capable of being faithful once I was married? Fuck!!! I was too young to be weighted down with thoughts like that. 

 I was naked and waiting when Vangie arrived on Wednesday and as usual just the thought of her going to be there had me hard as an iron bar. A fact that she noticed as soon as I opened the door and she used it as a leash to lead me to the bedroom where we engaged in hot sex until she had to leave. As she was dressing she said: 

 "Russ is going to a symposium on semi-conductors next week. He will be gone all week and won't be home until Friday sometime. Mommy will be all alone. Any chance you could spend the night with me? It will have to be at my place. I need to be there because he calls every night. Please say yes baby." 

 "What night?" 

 "Why not all of them? Make mommy happy and say yes baby. Please?" 

 The rest of the week went fast and I spent a very good weekend with Sarah. It was an odd thing. The more time I spent with her mother the closer I seemed to come to Sarah and the more I wanted to be with her. Since it was her official 'home' weekend she spent Friday and Saturday nights sleeping at her parent's house, but we still spent a significant amount of time at my place and a good part of that time was spent in the bedroom. I couldn't seem to get enough of Sarah. I just couldn't understand the pull that Sarah and her mother had on me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I rang the bell at Vangie's and it was like she wanted to establish a tradition. Just as I met her at the door naked when she came to my place she greeted me in nothing but her 'come fuck me' heels and she met me that way all four nights. 

 Waking up in the morning with Vangie was an experience in itself. She woke up before I did and then she woke me up by either fondling my cock or sucking on it. When I was hard enough to suit her she mounted me and rode me cowgirl until we both got off and then she pulled me into the shower with her. Doing each other's backs – and fronts – always seemed to lead to a resurrection of my cock and once that happened 'mommy' always wanted it and when in the shower 'mommy' always wanted it in her ass. 

 Each night I was there Russ called and when he did, no matter where we were or how close to cumming we were, Vangie made me stop and pull out and sit quietly on the bed until the call was over. There were a lot of "I love you's" and "I miss you's" and several "I wish you were here with me now's" and Vangie seemed like she was meaning every word she said. If that was the case why was I sitting on the bed? Why was she coming to my apartment? 

 As I was getting ready to leave Vangie asked, "Any chance you can fit mommy in for an hour or so tomorrow around two?" 

 I was all set to lie to her and tell her I would be out of town, but at the last minute I decided that it would be best to be straight with Vangie. If I kept trying to juggle her and Sarah it was bound to blow up in my face sooner or later. I could just see Vangie swinging by my place on a weekend when I told her I would be gone and end up with her seeing me with Sarah. If her mother wouldn't keep quiet about it Sarah would be pissed at me, but I figured I could work by it. So I sucked it up and told Vangie about how Sarah scheduled her weekends. 

 "I'm sure she doesn't want you to know because she doesn't think knowing that she sleeps with me on weekends will sit well with you and Russ." 

 I could pretty much tell from the look on her face that what I'd just told her in fact didn't set well with her, but all she said was: 

 "I knew you were probably having sex with her when you dated, but I didn't know it was that often." 

 There was a slight pause and then she said, "So I won't see you until Monday?" 

 I nodded and she shrugged, kissed me and left. 

 I had a great weekend with Sarah, but did occasionally have a thought or two about what my relationship with Vangie was going to be like when Sarah and I were married. Would Vangie expect that we would keep on going - finding some time here and there? As Sarah was leaving she told me that she would see me next weekend and I had to remind her that it was my weekend with the Guard. 

 "How long do we have to put up with that crap?" 

 "Two more years." 

 "What in the hell made you get into that in the first place?" 

 I shrugged and said, "It seemed like the thing to do at the time." 

 I didn't tell her that I'd been thinking of staying on when my current enlistment ended. I might have to rethink that after we were married. 

 Monday and Wednesday with Vangie were as hot and nasty as ever and there was no mentions of my weekends with Sarah. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday night Vangie was waiting for me in the parking lot when I got home from work and we had another night of hot and nasty sex. 

 Tuesday I skipped school and got together with some friends and we shot some pool and then ended up at Harry's Malt Shop. While we were sitting there Allison and two of her girlfriends came in. Allison noticed me and took a seat where she could see me and then tossed nasty glances at me until my friends and I got up and left. 

 Wednesday was more hot and nasty sex with a lot of "Fuck mommy baby" and "Fuck mommy's ass baby, fuck it hard" bouncing off the walls. 

 Thursday was mid-terms and Friday I left work and drove to Camp Forester to do my monthly weekend with the Guard. 

 Monday I rushed home from work, showered and put on a robe that I could discard as soon as I saw Vangie pull into the parking lot. For the next two hours I kept walking to the window to look for her, but she never showed up. She didn't show up Wednesday either. Oh well, I thought, it had to end sometime, but I would have liked it to last at least until Sarah and I were married. 

 Friday I fixed dinner and waited for Sarah to arrive. We would eat in and then play some cards or watch TV until Sarah let me know it was time to head for the bedroom. I did feel a little guilty knowing that Sarah would be taking care of the sexual frustration caused by her mother not showing up during the week. 

 Eleven p.m. arrived without Sarah showing or calling and I wondered if something had happened to her. If it was car trouble I was sure that she would have called. Sarah had a key so I went to bed thinking that she would be there in the morning when I woke up. She wasn't, but she did show up at ten, 

 She wasn't smiling and she turned her head when I went to kiss her and when I tried to hug her she pushed me away. 

 "What's wrong Sarah?" 

 "You are what is wrong." 

 I looked at her confused and she said, "Remember back when we discussed tests? I told you that you had passed the 'take care of Sarah' test and the 'sexual compatibility' test and you asked if there were any more and I told you there was one more. Remember?" 

 I nodded my head yes. 

 "Well you failed that test Frank." 

 "I don't understand. What test?" 

 "My mother is one sick lady. Every boyfriend I've ever had has been hit on by my mother. And she always – always Frank – tells me about it. Sometimes she tells me that she does it because most marriages fail in the bedroom and she doesn't want that to happen to me so she checked the guy out to make sure he was suitable. Sometimes she does it to see if he will cheat on me because once a cheater always a cheater and if he will cheat on me with my own mother he will cheat with anybody once we are married. That was the test Frank. You needed to shut down my mother and you didn't." 

 She took her ring off of her finger and dropped it on the floor and then she took the key I had given her to the apartment off of her key ring and dropped it on the floor next to the engagement ring. She turned and headed for the door. She opened the door and turned to face me and said: 

 "On the plus side mother did give you rave reviews on your bedroom behavior. Too bad you are a cheating asshole." 

 She turned and walked out closing the door behind her. I never saw her or her mother again until the company Christmas party where they both pointedly ignored me although Sarah did throw some nasty looks at my date, but if Gloria noticed she didn't say anything about it. 

 Gloria? Yeah; she was back. 

 

 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 04 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© About a month after Sarah kicked me to the curb I was sitting in a booth at the Denny's at Fourth and Hamilton when Gloria walked up and asked if I was alone and when I said that I was she asked if she could join me. 

 I told her to take a seat and we talked. I found out that she was home for a week because of a death in her family and when she asked where my girlfriend was I told her that Sarah and I had split. I asked her how her love life was going and she told me that she didn't have a steady boyfriend and then she asked if I still had my apartment. I told her that I did and she said: 

 "Then why are we sitting here wasting our time talking?" 

 "I can't think of one good reason for it" I said and we both stood up to go and Gloria followed me home. 

 It was a Friday night so I didn't have to work the next day and Gloria and I stayed in bed until almost ten and then I got up and fixed us breakfast. Gloria had nothing that she needed to do before returning to school Sunday afternoon so we spent the weekend together. We went to a couple of movies, ate in and screwed like sex crazed rabbits. When she left for school she told me that she would be back the next weekend and to keep it open for her. Unfortunately I had to tell her that it was my Guard weekend. 

 "Well from now on I want all your weekends that aren't claimed by the Guard." 

 Why not I thought. I could keep myself busy through the week with school and bowling and it would be nice to have my weekends covered and not have to sweat finding a date. If Gloria did come back every weekend. I hadn't forgotten her previous promises. I'd just have to wait and see. 

 She did come home and so it was that all my weekends except my Guard weekends were taken up by Gloria. It was inevitable that on some of those weekends Gloria and I would end up some place where Allison also was and I sure that Allison was confused by suddenly seeing me with Gloria instead of Sarah or at least she was until she found out from her mother who would have been told by my mother that Sarah and I had broken up. 

 I was eating lunch in the employee cafeteria on Friday and Russ came over to my table and sat down with me. He asked how I was doing and how my new job was going and then he asked: 

 "What happened between you and Sarah? One minute everything was going fine and the next minute it wasn't." 

 I would have bet my next years wages that neither Sarah or Vangie would have told him the real reason, but I decided that it would be best to keep things as close to the truth as possible so I said: 

 "Sarah got the idea that I was cheating on her while she was away in school. She told me that she couldn't stand cheaters and she broke up with me." 

 "Were you?" 

 "Was I what?" 

 "Cheating on her." 

 "No. I did hang around with a group that I went to school with and a couple of them were girls and one of the girls was the one that Sarah accused me of cheating with, but there was nothing going on between us. We just happened to be at the same place at the same time several times and someone must have thought that something was going on between us and told it to Sarah." 

 "You don't seem too broken up over it." 

 "I was at first, but after spending a week trying to get Sarah to talk to me with no luck I got to thinking that if she was going to get so warped out of shape over nothing while we were still single what would she be like when we were married? I decided that I didn't need to be tied to someone who could so readily believe that I was cheating when I wasn't." 

 "Too bad it didn't happen before you changed jobs. If it had I could have kept you in my department." 

 I shook my head and said, "To be honest about it I would rather not be working for you and still be with Sarah, but I guess part of life is not getting what you want." 

 "Amen to that. No chance you can work it out?" 

 "It was her choice and I'm not going to hang around and whine about it. If there were to be any chance it would all have to be up to Sarah and I don't see that in the cards." 

 Lunch period was over so I got up and went back to work. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Time slid by. I went back to bowling and took some additional classes so I was going to school Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. My weekends were spent with Gloria or the Guard and suddenly Thanksgiving was upon us. 

 Gloria had gone with her parents to visit her grandmother so I did Thanksgiving dinner with my parents. I figured that Mr. and Mrs. Ames would be there, but I didn't expect to see Allison. I thought she would be spending the day with her boyfriend's family, but I was wrong. She was there and my mother, meddlesome as ever, made sure that we were seated at the table next to each other. It was awkward to say the least. 

 Conversation buzzed around the table, but despite efforts to draw me into the conversation I stayed silent and I could see that mom and Mrs. Ames were upset that Allison and I made no attempt to speak to each other. Those two would go to their graves still trying to push Allison and me together. 

 The ritual at my parent's house was that the women prepared the meal and the men did the cleanup. As I scraped the plates prior to putting them into the dish washer my dad said: 

 "Would it hurt you to at least throw your mother a bone and try to be friendly with Allison?" 

 Mr. Ames was right there scrubbing pots in the sink so he heard it when I said: 

 "Allison wants nothing to do with me and she has made that perfectly clear." 

 "Nonsense" Mr. Ames said, "She talks about you all the time." 

 I was tempted to say "Oh sure" and then tell him about the paper bag full of used condoms that she gave me, but I of course kept my mouth shut. 

 When we were done in the kitchen we moved to the family room where we would have Bailey's Irish Cream and conversation. I would have put a damper on things with my silence so I thanked mom for a great dinner, said my goodbyes and left. When I got to my truck I saw something under the windshield wiper. It was a note. "Please call me" and it was signed by Allison. I read it twice and thought about it and then decided that no good would come of it so I crumpled up the note and dropped it to the ground. 

 Gloria came back from her visit and we spent the rest of the weekend together and three weeks later we attended my company Christmas party where Sarah and her mother cast nasty looks at Gloria and for what reason I couldn't figure. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It wasn't until New Year's Eve that Allison and I crossed paths again. We ended up at the same party, me with Gloria and Allison with some guy I'd never seen before. I noticed that every time I chanced to look her way she was looking at me and Gloria. I wondered what she was thinking. 

 About an hour into the party I headed off to the bathroom to take a whiz and when I came out I found Allison standing there waiting. I thought she was there to use the facilities so I stepped to the side to let her enter, but she moved with me and said: 

 "You never called me." 

 "What would be the point?" 

 "We need to talk Frank." 

 "No we don't Allison. Your paper bag and its contents said all that needed to be said. The message was clear and unmistakable." 

 "I was pissed Frank; I was upset and I lashed out without thinking. I should never have done what I did." 

 "And when did you realize that?" 

 "A couple of days later." 

 "That is when you should have tried talking with me Allison, before I said "screw it" and moved on." 

 "We belong together Frank and you know it. We've had a few rough spots, but nothing that we couldn't get by. All we need is to sit down and talk." 

 "It would be a waste of time. I'm with Gloria now and I'm happy with our relationship so sitting down and talking would accomplish nothing. Now if you will excuse me I need to get back to my date." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 It was the end of August when Gloria dropped the bomb on me. The previous eight months had been fairly routine for me. Work during the day, classes and bowling in the evenings and the weekends with Gloria. Gloria was taking summer classes, but she had no classes on Friday so she was usually at the apartment when I got there. 

 I stopped on the way home and picked up a pie for dessert. Gloria usually had dinner ready when I got home and that night was no different. After eating we did the dishes together – I washed and she dried – and it was while I was scrubbing a pot that she said: 

 "I'm pregnant." 

 No lead in, no "I have something to tell you" just a flat out "I'm pregnant." 

 I kind of froze for a couple of seconds and then asked "When?" 

 "When did I get pregnant? I don't know. Sometime in the last month or so." 

 "No, I mean when is it due?" 

 "No idea. I haven't seen a doctor yet. I haven't been feeling good and my period was late so I got one of those self-test things and it says that I'm pregnant." 

 I went back to scrubbing the pot. 

 "Aren't you going to say anything?" 

 "What's to say?" 

 ''What are we going to do?" 

 "That's up to you." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Just that, what happens is up to you." 

 "Why me? You are in this too." 

 I finished the last of the dishes in the sink and said, "I've never heard you say that you wanted kids. In fact, all you have talked about is your career after you get your degree." 

 "What about it?" 

 "Can you handle a career and a kid? Will a kid slow you down?" 

 "That's a cold way to look at it." 

 "Not cold, just practical. I don't care one way or the other. It has to be your decision." 

 "Oh sure; just dump it on me." 

 "Of course I'm dumping it on you. It's your body and you get to make the decisions where it is concerned. You get to be the one to decide if you want to be a mother or not." 

 "You bastard!" 

 "Hold on there. Just why am I a bastard?" 

 "Dumping it all on me." 

 "Well little girl I have news for you. It is all on you. I don't have to decide anything. You are pregnant so I need to marry you. Everything else is up to you. You have to decide where, when and how. You want a quickie at city hall or you want to set up a church wedding? You have to decide if you want to be a mother or not. If you decide to be a mother you will need to decide if you will be a full time or a working mom. You have to decide if you are going back to school or not. All the decisions that have to be made are yours." 

 "What if I don't want to get married?" 

 "Then we are right back where we started when I said that what happens is up to you." 

 "I always planned on marrying you, but not for a while. I'm not ready to be married." 

 "Your choice." 

 "I'm not ready to be a mother either." 

 "Again, your choice." 

 "Damn it Frank; you aren't any help at all." 

 "I'll support you in whatever you decide, but it is up to you to make the decisions where your life is concerned." 

 She threw the dish towel at me and stormed out of the room. I finished cleaning up and then dropped down in front of the TV to veg out. I wasn't able to get into anything that I watched because of what Gloria had dropped on me. I would of course step up to the plate and do what was right, but that didn't mean that I really wanted to. I had expected to get married some day and quite possibly to Gloria, but I was far from ready to be a husband and even farther from being ready to be a father. 

 Even when I had been engaged to Sarah I hadn't been ready, but it didn't matter then because we had decided not to tie the knot until she graduated and at the time that had been two years away, but regardless of what I thought I was ready for it appeared that "ready or not here it comes." 

 I heard the bedroom door close and a moment later Gloria walked to the front door and left the apartment without a word and I wondered what the hell I'd done wrong now as far as she was concerned. I did my part. I accepted the responsibility and said we would be married. What else was I supposed to do? She wasn't back when I went to bed at eleven and she wasn't there when I woke up in the morning. To hell with it I said and I went out and got myself some breakfast. 

 Gloria never came back or called over the rest of the weekend and I guessed she went back to school on Sunday afternoon as usual. I didn't hear from her during the week and she wasn't at the apartment when I came home Friday night. When she hadn't shown up by noon on Saturday I accepted an invitation to spend the rest of the weekend out at the lake with some friends. When I got back late Sunday night I could tell from the look of the place that Gloria hadn't been there and there were no messages on my answering machine. 

 I was having a hard time figuring out what was going on. I always thought that when an unmarried girl got pregnant the big push was to get married as soon as possible so the time between the marriage and the arrival of the baby would look pretty close to normal. It didn't look much like Gloria cared about appearances. Well, if she didn't care I wasn't going to worry about it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I went into work Monday I had no idea that the week was going to cause a major change in my life and the lives of many, many others. 

 I suppose everyone knows where they were and what they were doing at 8:41 a.m. on Tuesday, September 11th, 2001. I was at work and I had just pulled five units at random from the final assembly marshalling area and was bench checking them as part of our Quality Control program. I'd finished two and was hooking up a third to the oscilloscope when Jerry Petulkas came running into the shop and saying: 

 "You need to get down to the break room and see what's on the TV. You ain't going to believe it. Couple of planes flew into some buildings in New York. The news people are saying that it was deliberate." 

 At the time I didn't realize that it would have an impact on my life, but Gloria did. She called me two days later just after I got home from work. After saying hello she said that she had thought things over and decided that we needed to get married since she was going to keep the baby. 

 "I can get my blood test here and if you can get yours in the next day or so I'll come up a day early or stay over Sunday night and skip Monday classes and we can get the license. Then I think we have to wait three days. We can find out for sure when we apply. Then I can either come back early or stay over and we can get married at city hall." 

 "Why the rush now? It has been almost two weeks since you have talked to me." 

 "We have to get it done before you leave." 

 "Before I leave? What does that mean?" 

 "You're in the Army right? We need to get it done before they send you somewhere." 

 "Before who sends me where?" 

 "Before the Army sends you off to fight." 

 "What have you been smoking Gloria?" 

 "Nothing Frank." 

 "The Army isn't going to send me anywhere." 

 "That's not what I'm hearing here in Texas. The people who know the Bush clan say that George junior is just looking for a way to show his daddy that he has a set of balls. He will use the Army to do something about the attack in New York." 

 "Nonsense Gloria. It was just a bunch of terrorists that attacked us not some country. And even if he did do something he would use the Regular Army, not the Guard." 

 "Remember what his dad did when Saddam invaded Kuwait? He used the Guard and the Reserve and junior will do the same. You can bank on it." 

 "Not a chance Gloria; not a chance in hell." 

 Nine days later Gloria and I were married in a civil ceremony, six months later I was in Afghanistan and two months after that I was in Walter Reed recovering from wounds. 

 Gloria gave birth to Jessica Marie while I was hospitalized. I told everyone not to waste the money on a visit since I was told I would be released in four or five weeks. Released from Reed and the Guard. My trip to Afghanistan had resulted in my receiving a slight limp that would be with me for the rest of my life. It wasn't a bad limp, just bad enough to keep me from passing an active duty physical. 

 I talked with Gloria and my mom a couple of times a week and between the two of them I got the sense that all was not well back home. For one thing my mother always seemed to change the subject every time I kidded her about being a grandmother and I figured that it was probably because she and Gloria didn't see eye to eye on how to raise a kid. And I thought that because mom and Gloria didn't seem to see eye to eye on anything. Mom had never cottoned to Gloria and I naturally assumed that it was because Gloria was my wife instead of Allison. 

 Talking to Gloria was strange also. She seemed a bit distant when we talked and as I got closer to being released she became even more distant. I would have thought as I came closer to my release date she would get more excited about my coming home. Sometimes I thought from the way she sounded that she wasn't looking forward to my coming home at all. 

 And then I found out why. Mom and Gloria were not the only ones I was having phone conversations with. I received several calls from well meaning friends who told me that Gloria was spending a lot of time in the company of a man that no one seemed to know and that he had been seen leaving our apartment in the morning. That no one seemed to know him was an indication that the man wasn't from our town and that led me to believe that he was either a student where Gloria went to school or some Texan she met while staying at Baylor during the week. 

 What surprised me the most about the situation is that I wasn't surprised. Since the first time she dumped me back when she first went down there to attend Baylor I'd always suspected that she dated during the week. I had expected it to stop when we were married and I was disappointed that it apparently hadn't. We would be having a long talk when I did get home and divorce was definitely not out of the question. 

 The information about her apparent boyfriend changed things. I told Gloria that my release date was two weeks farther out than it actually was which led to me being in a rented car in the apartment parking lot at 6:40 a.m. one Wednesday morning when a tall red headed man came out of the apartment and got into a late model Toyota with Texas plates. I was also there at 6:21 p.m. when the same guy went into the apartment not to depart until 6:48 a.m. the next morning. 

 I followed him to an apartment complex on the other side of town. He got out of the car and went into apartment 3B. I sat and waited to see if he would come back out and he did at 7:36. I followed him to Anderson's Lumber and twenty minutes later he pulled out of the yard driving a truck loaded with building materials. 

 I waited until he was out of sight and then I checked out his car. I was in luck and it wasn't locked. I found the registration in the glove box. The car was registered to a Reginald Barrington. I was parked where I could watch the car when Barrington got off work. He came out, got in the car and drove back to his apartment, changed clothes and then drove to my apartment getting there at 6:23. I didn't bother to be there in the morning when he left since I already knew more than I wanted to. I drove to my motel and got some sleep and when I got up I made my plans. 

 Timing was the key. 

 I had to make my move during the time period between Barrington leaving his apartment and arriving at mine. At 6:12 I used my key and let myself into the apartment. Gloria was in the kitchen with her back to me when she said 

 "It's about time you got here lover." 

 "Way, way, way past time my love." 

 She turned around, dropped the dish she was holding shocked at seeing me and before she could say a word I said: 

 "They moved my release date up and I thought I would surprise you." 

 I opened my arms and said, "Come here baby; I've missed you." 

 I saw her make a quick glance at the wall clock and then the phone before coming to me. I hugged her and was kissing her when the door to the apartment opened and Barrington walked in. I looked at him in pretend surprise and said:  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 04 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Who are you and what are you doing in my apartment?" 

 I saw fear flash across Gloria's face. Barrington was quick; I'd have to give him that. He took a step back and looked at the apartment number on the door and said: 

 "Oops; I guess I wasn't paying attention. I'm one door off. Sorry to disturb you" and he backed out and closed the door behind him. 

 I didn't say anything except, "Where is the baby? I want to see my child." 

 I felt some of the tension leave Gloria and she took my hand and led me to the back bedroom. The baby was asleep in a crib and Gloria eased the blanket down so I could get a good look at the baby. The child woke up and looked up at me and as I looked down at her several things suddenly became clear. Things like the way my mother behaved when talking about Gloria. Things like why mother was always quick to change the subject when I kidded her about being a grandmother. 

 The baby had red hair and green eyes. 

 No one in my family had red hair or green eyes. Gloria's hair was as black as a raven's wing and she had brown eyes. Barrington was red headed and I would bet that he also had green eyes. 

 My plan to sit down and have a long talk with Gloria about whether or not we could get past her having an affair while I was gone went right into the trash can. Without looking at her I asked Gloria: 

 "Does Barrington have a cell phone?" 

 "What are you talking about? Who is Barrington?" 

 "Give it up Gloria. You're busted. The fact that I know the name should tell you that." 

 "I don't know what you are talking about. I don't know anyone named Barrington." 

 "Unless he is driving someone else's car he is the man who walked in the door a couple of minutes ago. He is also the man who entered this apartment Tuesday night and didn't leave until 6:40 the next morning. The same man who came in here Wednesday night at 6:21 and didn't leave until 6:48 Thursday morning. Whatever his name is you need to get in touch with him and get him to come back for you and his kid. I'm going over to my parent's house and spend the night. I will come back here tomorrow afternoon after three and you and your kid need to be gone. I'll see an attorney in the morning and start the end to this sorry mess." 

 "You aren't making any sense here Frank. I don't know anyone named Barrington." 

 "Jesus Christ Gloria; are you fucking brain dead? I just told you I have been sitting out in the parking lot watching that red headed asshole spend the last three nights in this apartment. Maybe his name isn't Barrington. The car he is driving is registered to a Reginald Barrington and maybe this Barrington guy loaned his car to the red headed asshole who just walked in the door. What about when I walked in the door? Your back was to me and you didn't know it was me and you weren't expecting me so where the fuck did that "It's about time you got here lover" come from? And are you going to tell me that it is just a coincidence that your bed buddy and this baby both have red hair and green eyes? Well I ain't buying it Gloria. 

 "You want to know my take on this? No, of course you don't, but I'm going to give it to you anyway. Way back when you first told me that you were pregnant you were just priming the pump; setting me up for the fall in case you couldn't get the red headed asshole to marry you. I always wondered why you went back to Baylor and didn't talk to me for almost two weeks after hitting me with the pregnancy shit. It was because you were busy trying to talk Barrington or whoever the fuck he is into marrying you and I guess he told you to fuck off and so it was back to Plan B – me! I'll even go a step farther and guess that the reason he wouldn't marry you is because he knew he wasn't the only guy fucking you while you were down there going to school and he didn't think the kid was his. 

 "No matter. Bottom line is that you are busted and we are done. Be gone when I get back here tomorrow." 

 I left the apartment and went straight to a phone and cancelled the two credit cards that we had and arranged for a new card in my name only and with a different account number. The bank would have to wait until the morning. 

 I received a joyous welcome at my parent's place and after things settled down mom said: 

 "I know that your first stop would have been your apartment, but I see that you have your bags with you." 

 "Yes indeed and I'm betting that you know why. Why didn't you tell me?" 

 "You had enough to worry about and there wasn't anything you could have done from where you were so why add to your load? Besides, you might have been able to get by it. She might have been able to show you or convince you that there was red hair and green eyes in her family." 

 "Maybe, but there wasn't anyway she could explain away the red headed asshole she was sleeping with when I got home." 

 "Oh my; I didn't know about that. What are you going to do?" 

 "See a lawyer and go for a divorce or maybe an annulment. She obviously lied to me when she said we had to get married because I was the father of the child." 

 "I'm sorry honey. Gloria wouldn't have been my choice for you, but I had hoped that things would work out for you." 

 I spent the night in my old room and mom fed me breakfast in the morning and then I headed for town and was standing at the door when the bank opened. I cleaned out the savings and checking accounts and closed them. I opened a new checking account in my name only and filled out the necessary paperwork to have my direct deposits go to the new account. That done I headed over to Home Depot and got a new locking door knob and dead bolt. 

 When I got there Barrington or whatever his name might be was loading suitcases into the back of the car he was driving. I looked him over and thought that even with my gimpy leg I could take him; maybe teach him that fucking another man's woman wasn't a good thing and then I thought maybe it wasn't that way at all. Maybe he saw it as me fucking his woman. Maybe she was cheating on him with me when she came home for the weekends. Fuck it! It wouldn't be worth the effort. 

 In the apartment Gloria was looking around to make sure she hadn't forgotten anything. When she was done she headed for the door and I stepped in front of her and held out my hand palm up and said: 

 "Keys to the apartment and truck." 

 She dug through her hand bag, came up with them and handed them to me. I stepped aside so she could leave and she said: 

 "Don't I even get a kiss goodbye?" 

 "Your boyfriend out there might not approve." 

 I turned and walked away from her and she left the apartment and pulled the door closed behind her. Even though I had gotten her keys she might have a spare so I got busy and changed the locks with what I'd picked up at Home Depot. That done I had the rest of the weekend to get through and I visited a couple of my old haunts and said hello and visited to old friends that I ran into. 

 Monday morning I called an attorney and made an appointment to see him that afternoon. I told him my story and he told me that getting an annulment would be the way to go, but if she fought it things would probably devolve into a regular divorce and at that point we would need tests to determine the paternity of the child in order for me to avoid having to pay child support. I told him to go ahead with the paper work and gave him Barrington's address as the place to serve Gloria. 

 I left the attorney and drove over to XYZ and paid a visit to the HR office and filled out the necessary paperwork for returning to work and then I went back to my parent's place for dinner. I told them about what had gone on and about my visit to the lawyer and then my mom said: 

 "You really should say hi to Allison now that you are home." 

 Some things never change. I wasn't even out of my marriage to Gloria and mom was trying to get me back with Allison. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I went back to work and back to school. I had one semester remaining to get my Associates Degree in Business Management. I rejoined the Wednesday night bowling league and surprisingly my average went from 160 to 175. It seems that my limp slowed down my approach to the foul line and gave me a better delivery. 

 I didn't do any dating because I didn't want to give Gloria anything she could use against me in case she might want to fight the breakup so it was just work, bowl and school for me while I waited to see what happened. 

 At work Randy retired and Melvin moved up to take his spot and then John surprised the hell out of me and moved me up to take Melvin's spot. I had hoped to move up in the company; that is why I was taking classes, but I hadn't expected anything to happen for a couple of years. The frosting on the cake – the end to a great day – came when I got home from work and got my mail out of the mail box. My annulment came through. 

 I went out to celebrate that night with some old classmates. We ended up at a party and by the end of it I had a date for Saturday with Bev Holbrook. I didn't even have to work for it. Bev came up to me and said: 

 "I hear that you finally found out about Gloria and Reggie and tossed her out on her cheating ass." 

 "That pretty much sums it up." 

 "You know I divorced Al right?'' 

 "No, I didn't know that." 

 "Dumped him for the same reason you got rid of Gloria. I caught him sliding between the sheets with Nancy Neubert. I guess we are both single now." 

 My daddy didn't raise no dummy and I saw Bev's comment as an invitation so I said: 

 "As both of us are single I guess I'm free to ask you if you would like to go out some time." 

 "I don't have anything going for Friday." 

 "Well then, how about we get together Friday and do something?" 

 Friday was dinner and a movie and after the movie we hit a party that she knew about. When we left the party we had no sooner gotten in my truck when Bev said: 

 "You know what I miss most about not being married? The sex. I miss having a sex life." 

 Again, my daddy didn't raise a dummy so I looked her right in the eye and said: 

 "Your place or mine?" 

 "Yours. My sister moved in with me when I kicked Al out." 

 When we got to my place I warned her I might be a little quick as it had been almost a year since I'd last had sex. 

 "So what? Unless you have something else to do we have all night." 

 The first time was pretty quick, but the second time took a bit longer and the third time I managed to get her off twice before I finished, Bev was one hot lady in bed and her blow jobs were state of the art. 

 As I was driving Bev home she said, "I don't know about you, but I'm in no hurry to get into another serious relationship right now, but I enjoyed tonight. I don't want to be running around just taking on anybody to have a sex life. Have you ever heard about a friends with benefits relationship?" 

 "I have." 

 "Interested?" 

 I didn't even have to spend two seconds thinking on it. "I certainly am" I said and that was the start of a relationship that got me laid at least twice a week for the next four months. Then one Tuesday night after a very energetic and sweaty encounter Bev told me that it was our last time. 

 "I met a guy I think I might get serious with." 

 I wished her good luck and told her that there would always be room on my bed for her if things didn't work out. She gave me a hot kiss, told me that she would hold me to it and then she was gone. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two weeks after Bev said goodbye it was Thanksgiving and I was invited to my parents for dinner. I expected to see Mr. and Mrs. Ames there and probably Allison, but I was surprised to see that Allison wasn't there. From the table talk I gathered that Allison was spending the day with her boyfriend and his parents. I also gathered from the conversation that Mr. and Mrs. Ames didn't think highly of Allison's choice, but at least for the first time in years neither my parents nor Allison's said anything about me and Allison needing to hook up. 

 The talk in the kitchen as my dad, Mr. Ames and I took care of the clean up stuck mostly to what Bush was doing in the Middle East and sports. Both my dad and Mr. Ames worked on me to join veteran's organizations and they argued – good naturedly – about which one's were the best. My dad was American Legion and Mr. Ames was Veterans of Foreign Wars, but I wasn't much of a joiner and wasn't interested in either one, but I kept my mouth shut and let them talk away while I would occasionally nod my head as one or the other made a point about something. 

 After clean up I thanked mom for a wonderful dinner, complimented Mrs. Ames on her mince-meat pie with rum and raisin sauce and said my goodbyes. When I opened the door of my truck and the interior light came on I saw Allison sitting on the passenger side. I hesitated for a moment and then got in. 

 "Surprised?" Allison asked. 

 "Very. I was told you were spending the day with your boyfriend and his parents." 

 "I did, but I got away as soon as I could." 

 "Why are you here?" 

 "God Frankie; you sure can be stupid sometimes." 

 "Yeah? Well I guess that it comes naturally to me." 

 "Duh Frank. I'm not with my ex-boyfriend, I'm sitting in your truck waiting for you so you figure it out." 

 "Sorry Allison; my mind doesn't seem to be working right now. You spell it out for me." 

 "It is simple Frank. You have been wasting my life. First it was that cunt Sarah, then that whore Gloria and when you finally get smart and get rid of her you hooked up with Bev Holbrook before I could get to you. I didn't get home from school until yesterday or I'd have been at your door the day after you broke up with Bev. I'm in this truck to make damned sure I get you before you find some other worthless bitch and make another mistake. We have wasted enough time Frank. Start the truck, drive to your apartment and let's get this show on the road." 

 I turned the key, pulled away from the curb and as soon as we were out of sight of the house Allison slid over next to me and her hands went to my zipper. 

 "Don't you dare hit anything" she said and then she lowered her head, took me into her mouth and sucked me until I pulled into the parking lot at my apartment. She sat up, opened the passenger door and said: 

 "You might have to call in sick tomorrow because I don't intend to leave you enough energy to get out of bed in the morning." 

 She was damned near as good as her word. The only thing that got me out of bed in the morning was my strong work ethic. As I was getting dressed for work Allison said: 

 "I'll be here when you get home from work tonight. Plan on a strenuous weekend." 

 And it was. We never left the apartment and Sunday as she was dressing to leave she said: 

 "I will be back every weekend and I expect you to be here waiting for me. I graduate in May and I would like a June wedding. We will talk about it next weekend so between now and then you need to think about when we should clue in our parents. It shouldn't take them all that long to set things up, God knows they have been planning it for fifteen years." She paused for a moment and then asked, "What are you thinking?" 

 "I was just wondering when you started being such a take charge person." 

 "When I woke up to the fact that I wasn't going to get what I wanted if I sat around and waited for it to come to me. You are the perfect case in point. Given our past history if I just sat and waited for you to come to me what are the odds that you would have shown up?" 

 "Not good." 

 "See what I mean?" 

 She came over and kissed me and then said, "Run me home baby. I need to say goodbye to my parents before I head back to school." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 They might have started planning the wedding fifteen years ago, but that was then and this was now. Mrs. Ames greeted the news with less than enthusiastic joy. She didn't say or do anything to indicate disapproval or approval, but I got the distinct impression that she could have done without the news. Later I asked Allie about it. 

 "She thinks I'm making a big mistake." 

 "I guess I can understand that. I haven't exactly been the poster boy for good relationships." 

 Allie gave me a funny look and then she said, "It isn't you baby, it is me." 

 "You?" 

 "I went a little crazy back when. I went off on an "I'll show him" binge after that day at your apartment. I changed boyfriends as often as you changed socks and I won't lie to you baby, I fucked every one of them. My mom thinks I'm a slut and she thinks I'll always be a slut even after I marry you. She just doesn't believe I should be getting married at all." 

 "Just how big a slut were you? How many?" 

 "None of your business baby. I'm not interested in your sex life before our engagement and I'm not telling you anything about mine other than to say that all of it was to spite you." 

 She was right. What happened before was in the past and none of my business. Except that it was. At least once anyway. It happened at a party we attended two weeks before Christmas. Allie was off talking with a couple of girls and Bert Ellsworth (yes – the pigtail puller) came up to me. Bert had probably had a few beers too many to watch his mouth and he said: 

 "I hear you and Allison are getting married. Any truth to it?" 

 "That's the plan." 

 "You are one lucky son of a bitch. She's the best piece of ass I've ever had. I won't bother her after you are married, but I'm going to fuck her as much as I can before you get married." 

 It took four guys to pull me off of him, but it would be months before his reproductive equipment would be well enough for him to use for anything other than taking a piss. Several guys heard what he said to me before I stomped his ass and two of them swore that Bert tossed the first punch and I'd only defended myself. After that little fracas the word must have gone out that if you had boned Allison it would be best not to let me hear about it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The following week was my company Christmas party and of course I had Allison with me. The first people I saw when I walked into the hotel ballroom were Russ and Evangelina Backman. I didn't see Sarah with them and I breathed a sign of relief. The last thing I wanted was for Allison to be asking "Why are those two women staring daggers at us." Not that I cared what the female Backmans did; I just didn't want to explain. 

 Russ waved me over and invited us to join them, but I told him that I had already committed to sharing a table with some guys from my shop. I introduced Allison to Russ and Vangie and I noticed that Vangie checked out Allison the way women check the competition and I had to wonder about that. 

 After dinner and the usual speeches the band started to play. I danced with Allison for a couple of tunes and then danced with the wives and girlfriends at the table and their husbands and boyfriends danced with Allison. Maybe an hour after the music started I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came out I found Vangie waiting in the hallway for me. I tried to move by her but she grabbed my arm and said: 

 "I need a favor Frank." 

 "You fuck up my life and you want me to do you a favor?" 

 "I didn't, as you put it, "Fuck up your life." I did you a favor, but that's neither her nor there. I gave you some good times baby and now I need a favor." 

 "What?" 

 "I need you to dance with me at least once." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because Russ has commented on it. You've danced with me at other parties and he is wondering why you haven't come over and asked me." 

 "I didn't dance with you at the last Christmas party." 

 "That's because Sarah was with us and your breakup was too fresh. Come on baby; do me this little favor, please?" 

 "I'll see" I said as I broke away from and went back to the party. I danced a couple of more times with Allison and then I asked her to excuse me while I took care of a duty dance.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 04 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "A duty dance?" 

 "The boss's wife." 

 I walked over to where Russ and Vangie were sitting and asked Russ if I might have the pleasure of a dance with Vangie. As we moved out onto the floor Vangie whispered a husky "Thank you" in my ear. The woman had shafted me, but she was still a stone fox and the sexiest woman I'd ever known and having her in my arms gave me the hard on I always got when I saw her. It touched her leg and she whispered: 

 "It looks as if I haven't lost my touch." 

 "You are one fucking evil bitch." 

 "Oh come on baby; you don't really mean that." 

 "Of course I mean it. You fucked up my life." 

 "How can you say that?" 

 "I was all set to spend the rest of my life fucking the two sexiest women I'd ever met and you ruined it for me. Why the hell did you tell Sarah about us?" 

 "You aren't going to believe it, but I did it to save you." 

 "Save me?" 

 "Yes baby, to save you. You would not have been happy married to Sarah." 

 "How can you possibly know that?" 

 "I know my daughter baby and I know she is a much bigger slut than I am and not only that, but she is a two-faced hypocrite." 

 The music stopped and she said, "You have my cell number. Call me. We can have lunch and I'll explain it all to you." 

 When I got back to Allison she said, "You seemed awful friendly with her." 

 "Hey, she was almost my mother-in-law and she still thinks Sarah screwed up when she broke us up. So you had better watch your P and Qs because she still wants us to get back together." 

 "She in that much of a hurry to see her daughter dead?" 

 "What?" 

 "You are mine Frank and I'll kill to keep you if I have to. Understand?" 

 "Yes dear." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I put Vangie's invitation out of my mind, but two weeks later I saw Sarah walking across the parking lot on her way to see Russ. Seeing her triggered the memory of the Christmas party and Vangie's invitation to call. Curiosity being what it is I finally gave into it and gave Vangie a call. 

 We met for lunch at Alphonso's. I got there first and when she came in and walked toward the table I got my usual instant hard on and I noticed every male eye in the place was on her. I stood up to greet her and her eyes immediately checked me out and she smiled as she said: 

 "Good boy. You do know how to let a girl know she is appreciated." 

 "I only have an hour so why don't you give me that explanation." 

 "Wait until we order." 

 The waitress came, took our order and as she walked away Vangie said: 

 "I told Sarah about us so she would break up with you. I came after you so we would do what we did and I could tell Sarah." 

 "But why?" 

 "For the same reason I went after everyone of her other boyfriends. To cause the breakups. I knew that once she knew I'd had you she would call you a cheating asshole and cut you loose." 

 "Again, why?" 

 "Remember I told you she was a two-faced hypocrite? Well baby, while you were fucking me she was out fucking around on you. She has a full-time lover – an older man she has been fucking for years – and she has also been fucking two of his friends. In addition to her three lovers she pulls trains at frat parties. During every one of your Guard weekends she was on her back at the Phi Delta house taking on all comers. Check it out if you don't believe me. I'm sure you must know some guys who belong to the fraternity. I don't know if she did it before the night you stepped in and stopped it or if that night got her curious to try it, but however it happened she is doing gangbangs. She did them the entire time she was your intended and she is still doing them. But you of course are the cheating asshole." 

 "And you know all of this how?" 

 "Ever since I found out about her older lover I've kept a close eye on Sarah. I've even put a private detective on her from time to time. He was on her the night you rescued her. I knew all about you taking her to room 128 at the Motel 6. I assumed that you were in there fucking the little whore's brains out until you told me different." 

 "If you knew why wasn't Russ trying to kill me?" 

 "He didn't know because I didn't tell him." 

 "Why would you keep it to yourself? He had to be worried sick when she didn't come home." 

 "If I had told him he would have known about the detective and I couldn't have that." 

 "But why....." and then it dawned on me and Vangie read it on my face. 

 "That's right baby. No way could I let him know." 

 "They don't care that you know?" 

 "They don't know that I know. Why do you think I make it a point to seduce all of her boyfriends? It is my way of getting even. I tell her I'm doing it for her; to prove to her that the guy is a cheater and once a cheater always a cheater or I give her some bullshit about what happens in the bedroom is seventy percent of a good marriage and I just want to make sure she is getting a good man. And just so you know I gave you rave reviews. What I was really doing was getting even with her and making sure that you didn't get stuck with the little whore. 

 "She was really pissed when I told her I'd gotten you. They had big plans for you. You working with daddy meant they could always be sure of where you were." 

 "No they couldn't. It was Russ himself who told me that I couldn't work for him once I married Sarah." 

 "And who was it who pointed you at the perfect job to put in for?" 

 "But that still took me away from him." 

 "But still in the building, right? Remember I told you she was fucking her older lover and two of his friends? Care to guess who one of those friends is?" She saw my facial expression and said, "That's right baby. Between John, Russ and the Guard they always knew where you would be and they could schedule their time accordingly and then mommy had to go and screw things up for them." 

 "There are things I still don't understand, but I need to get back to work. Thanks for telling me all this. I'm not sure that I really needed to know it, but least now I don't feel so bad about the breakup with Sarah. Knowing that she didn't love me and was only planning on using me changes the way I was seeing things. Got to run. Take care" and I hurried back to work. 

 I left Vangie with the impression that what she'd told me changed things for me and the way I looked at things, but that wasn't true. Sarah was in the past and while I did miss her some she was still in the past and I only concerned myself with the present and the future. To be honest about it I missed Vangie as much, or more, than I missed Sarah. To be totally honest if I had been given a choice over who I'd want to spend my life with there is a very good chance I would have chosen Vangie over Sarah. The only bad part was knowing that if Sarah and I had hung together I would have had primo job security. I would never have known why, but I would have had it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I didn't have class that night so I went straight home from work. I got some leftovers out of the fridge, but before I could put them in the microwave and nuke them the doorbell rang. I opened the door and there stood Vangie in low cut top, mini-skirt, and high heels and I went instantly hard. 

 "It is Wednesday night baby; Fraternal Order of Eagles night for hubby." 

 Before she could say another word I steeped aside and let her come in. 

 "Glad to see mommy baby?" she asked as she reached down and ran her hand over the steel bar covered by my trousers. "I guess you are." 

 "I don't understand Vangie. Why are you here? After all of this time why are you here?" 

 "Several reasons baby, but most of all because I want to be here. I had to stop seeing you to keep my cover story intact – that I only sampled you for the reasons I gave Sarah – even though I really wanted to be here. When you left lunch today you said there were still some things that you didn't understand, but I also needed to show you something. So let's start with the things you still don't understand." 

 "None of it makes sense to me. Why are you still with Russ knowing what you know? What kind of relationship do you have with Sarah that you can screw her boyfriends and then talk about it with her? I assume from the way you tell the story that Russ doesn't know you do Sarah's guys; why hasn't she told him?" 

 "I'll take them in the order you asked. I haven't left Russ because I understand what is happening between him and Sarah. I had the same kind of relationship with my father and it continued until he died. It continued even after I married Russ. The relationship, as good as it was, was always a tense one because of the fear that mother would find out. That tenseness added to the relationship and made it more exciting. I want Russ and Sarah to feel that same tenseness so I've never let them know that I know. 

 "The situation with Sarah is a little more simple. When my father died he left me a great deal of money. I have the money in the family and both Sarah and Russ like the life style that the money gives us. Sarah believes that if she told Russ what I do with her boyfriends it would lead to a divorce and she and Russ would be out on their butts and living in an apartment somewhere. To be honest, I've led her to believe that. The truth is that I love Russ so it would never happen, but Sarah doesn't know that. 

 "I know it sounds strange to hear me say that I'm doing what I do to get even with Russ and Sarah for what they are doing and in the same breath say I'm okay with what they are doing, but what the hell, I'm only human so I guess I can be as fucked up as any other human." 

 The last thing" she said as she took a cassette out of her purse "is this. When you left me at the restaurant you thanked me for letting you know that Sarah didn't love you, but was only out to use you. I don't know why, but I couldn't let that go. A long time ago when I decided I needed to know what was going on I had the house wired for audio and video." 

 Ashe got up, went to the entertainment center and turned on the TV and VCR. She slid the cassette into the VCR and pushed the 'play' button. 

 "I've forwarded the tape to the part I want you to see." 

 On the screen I saw a naked Sarah lying next to her naked father and fondling his cock as he was saying: 

 "Are you sure that you want to marry Frank?" 

 "Of course I'm sure. I love him daddy." 

 "Aren't you afraid we will have to stop once you and Frank are married?" 

 "Don't be silly daddy. If we can hide if from mom we can hide it from Frank. In fact it will be easier hiding it from him. He will be gone one weekend a month so we know where he will be and as long as he works for you we will always know where he is." 

 "When you get married he will have to leave my section. Company rules say that people related can't work together in the same area." 

 "So get him moved to Uncle John's division. That way the two of you can keep an eye on him." 

 "It would be a lot easier all the way around if you would just find another guy." 

 "No way daddy. Frank is perfect for me and I love him daddy; I really, really do love him." 

 Vangie hit the stop button and said, "She might have been going to use you, but she did love you." 

 "Then why did you break us up? She and Russ could have had their thing on the side and you and I could have had ours." 

 "If it was just Russ that is the way I would have gone, but there was Russ and his two friends – John and Larry – and by then Sarah was doing her gangbangs at the fraternity house. No way was I going to let you get stuck with what Sarah had become. But that was then and this is now and I'm not wearing anything under this skirt. Does that give you any ideas?" 

 It did and it wasn't long before "Oh yes, oh fuck yes, fuck mommy baby" was ringing through the apartment as I pumped into her clutching pussy. When I pulled my soft cock out of her pussy she said: 

 "I've missed that baby. It's been so long for me." 

 "Oh come on Vangie; as hot and as sexy as you are you can get all you want. Walk into any place where males congregate and you would have your choice of dozens of guys wanting to hook up with you." 

 "Not so baby. I only do my husband and whoever Sarah dates, anything else would be cheating, but since Sarah isn't dating and I still feel the need to get even I have to cheat. What I'm doing now is cheating." 

 "I'm sorry." 

 "I'm not. I missed you baby. Would you like to stick your dick in mommy's ass? Please?" 

 "As soon as it is able." 

 "I'll help" she giggled and took me in her mouth. 

 When she dressed to leave she said, "Ross doesn't go to the Eagles on Wednesday and he doesn't bowl either. Those are the excuses he uses to get out of the house and meet Sarah at motels, John's house or Larry's apartment. Can mommy come back and visit on those nights?" 

 I know it was wrong and that I was cheating on Allison, but I couldn't say no to Vangie. I know it sounds stupid when I say it, but it was like Vangie had cast a spell over me. She owned me and had since the very first time she had cried out "fuck mommy baby; fuck mommy hard" and I just could not say no to her. I swear that if she said to me "Follow me home and fuck me while Russ and Sarah watch" I would have done it. I can't explain it, but there it was. Again, the woman owned me. I told her she could come to me whenever she wanted. She gave me a passionate kiss goodbye and went home. 

 After she was gone and I had gone to bed I lay there and thought about how Vangie's coming back into my life was going to change things. We had no real future. She loved her husband and she was as old as my mother (actually I found out later she was three years older than my mother) but she seemed to like spending time with me and I loved having her on my bed. Then I said "Fuck it!!! She's back and that is all that matters." 

 At work the next day I couldn't help but look at John and wonder why in the hell Sarah was fucking him. He was fifty, thirty to forty pounds over weight and wore a horrible looking wig to cover his bald head. All I could think of was that he must have a twelve inch cock. Whatever! He had my unspoken thanks since he was part of the reason that Vangie had come back to see me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Vangie was back again the next night and after draining my balls for the third time she asked me if I thought I could get away to spend the weekend with her. Russ was going somewhere and so was Sarah and Vangie knew from her surveillance system that even though they were heading off in opposite directions they were going to end up in the same place. 

 "I want to do you on Russ's bed again. I want to do what we did the last time and screw on Sarah's bed and all over the house. I want you on the kitchen table where Russ usually sits. I want to be nasty where ever Russ and Sarah usually sit or do things." 

 I was tempted and did not immediately say yes and after a moment or two Vangie said: 

 "What's the matter baby? You don't want a kinky weekend with mommy?" 

 I sucked it up and told her that I really did want to do it, but there was a problem. I told her about my relationship with Allison and that Allison would leave school and show up at my apartment Friday night and would be with me until late Sunday afternoon. When I finished Vangie said: 

 "I hate her. I don't even know her, but I hate her. I hate that she is stealing my kinky weekend from me, but I don't want to come between you and your girlfriend. You need a normal relationship with someone your own age. I guess if you can live with the fact I'm sleeping with Russ I can handle you sleeping with your girl. But I still get you when she is at school, right?" 

 "Absolutely, although I don't how I'll handle it when she graduates this coming May." 

 "We can cross that bridge when we come to it." 

 She was silent for several seconds and then she said, "You have my cell number. If she breaks down or something else happens to keep her from getting here this weekend give me a call." 

 She kissed me and left me wondering if there was some way to keep Allison away for the weekend. Try as I might I couldn't think of a thing. 

 Allison was at the apartment when I got home from work Friday and we went out for dinner and then to a movie. It wasn't nice of me and I know it, but I spent the entire weekend with Allison thinking about what I could be doing with Vangie. Allison left at three on Sunday and I immediately called Vangie and asked if she knew what time Russ and Sarah would be back. 

 "I don't expect either of them before seven, but I can't gamble on it. There will be another time baby. We will still have a chance to make it happen. 

 

 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 05 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© For the next four and a half months I saw Vangie at least twice a week and Allison on the weekends. One day in mid April the inevitable happened. 

 "Have you given any thought to when the wedding should be Frank?" 

 "No Allie; I guess I was leaving that up to you." 

 "Why me?" 

 "Because we have never discussed what you wanted. I don't know if you want to wait until you get established in your career or get married right after graduation. Once you told me you wanted a June wedding, but you never mentioned weddings again. Other than joking about our moms planning a wedding you have never said whether you want a small wedding or a large one. For all I know you may only want a witness or two and a quickie ceremony at city hall." 

 "That would work for me, but you and I both know we would never be able to face our mothers again if we did that. No baby; we have to let the moms do their thing even though it may only be half-hearted on my moms part now. She still isn't too keen on you being stuck with me." 

 I thought that her mom might have a point. Not about me being stuck with Allison, but that the two of us shouldn't marry. I wouldn't be stuck with Allie; she would be stuck with me and even though Allie didn't know it I knew I'd be lying when we got to the 'forsake all others' part of the ceremony. I knew I'd never give up Vangie. Vangie might give me up, but I was hooked on her and would never willingly give up hearing "Fuck mommy baby; fuck mommy hard." 

 Allison interrupted my thoughts. "So when do you want to do it?" 

 "Doesn't matter to me Allie; I'm the guy. All I have to do is show up and be standing there when you come down the aisle. The women do all the planning and shit so pick what you want and get with the moms. All you need to do is let me know when to be there." 

 "I want a June wedding so pencil in the month at least. I'll get with the moms and see what date will work for us." 

 Allison and the moms huddled and after a bunch of phone calls to see who, what, where and how they came up with a when of the third Saturday in June. 

 I told Vangie about it during our Thursday night get together and she said: 

 "Should I try to get Sarah to do your bachelor party? She could give you a lap dance, a blow job and then take on all comers. Isn't that what strippers do at bachelor parties?" 

 "She still doing frat parties?" 

 "I don't watch her full time, but the last time I had someone on her was about six weeks ago and she was doing them then." 

 "I think I'll pass. For my bachelor party I want you." 

 "Sorry lover, but I don't play the railroad game." 

 "The railroad game?" 

 "I don't pull trains lover." 

 "That's not what I meant. What I meant was that all I want for a bachelor party is you." 

 "Oh lover; that is just so sweet. You love mommy's pussy?" 

 "You know I do." 

 "Like my ass a little?" 

 "I like your ass a lot." 

 "What do you like best about mommy; her ass, pussy or mouth?" 

 "What I love most is the package that all three come in." 

 "What a nice thing to say. Just for that I think I'll let you fuck me in the ass. Are you ready?" 

 I was. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Three weeks before her graduation, just before she left me to go back to school, Allison told me that she wouldn't be coming home the following weekend. 

 "I've got some parties to go to with my schoolmates. You want to come up and go with me?" 

 "No thanks. I don't know any of them so I'd just end up standing around looking lost." 

 Monday night I told Vangie that Allison wouldn't be coming home and asked her if there was anyway she could get free so we could spend the weekend together. 

 "Maybe. Russ usually finds some place to go when my period comes and I get bitchy. I'm a week away from it, but if I start being a bitch on Wednesday he may be tired of it enough by Friday that he will find something to do over the weekend. With him gone we could get together. What I would really like to do is find someway to get Sarah to go somewhere. I do love you doing me on my bed and in my own house. I'll see what I can do." 

 Wednesday she told me that she had started being a bitch that morning. "I should know by Friday morning if it will work. Come on baby; show mommy what she has to look forward to this weekend." 

 Thursday night she told me that Russ had mentioned that he, John and Larry were thinking of going fishing over the weekend. 

 "I'll start laying in groceries so we won't have to leave he apartment." 

 "Hold off on that for a bit. If Russ, John and Larry are going to get together there is a good chance that Russ will work on Sarah to join them. If that happens we will spend the weekend at my place." 

 "Call me as soon as you know. Either way I'm ready for it." 

 The call came at noon on Friday. I was in the break room eating my lunch and it just so happened that Russ joined me about two minutes before the call came in on my cell. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hi baby. We are on for my place this weekend. Russ is going fishing and surprise, surprise, Sarah is going to spend the weekend visiting a friend from school." 

 "Wonderful. See you at six?" 

 "Better make it eight. Want to give them time to leave and make sure that they don't come back for something they forgot." 

 "You got it. See you around eight." 

 When I dropped my cell back in my pocket Russ asked, "You talked to Sarah lately?" 

 "No. She has stayed clear of me ever since we broke up." 

 "For someone who won't talk to you she sure talks about you a lot." 

 "Nothing good I'd bet" 

 "On the contrary. She is always asking about you and how you are doing. Why not give her a call. It can't hurt." 

 "Wouldn't help either. I'm getting married in June." 

 "Oh? Sarah isn't going to take that well." 

 "Why would she care? Don't forget, she is the one who told me to take a hike." 

 "You remember back when I told you about "Yes dear" and "Whatever you want my dear?" 

 I nodded a yes. 

 "There were a couple of others that I didn't mention. One of them is you are supposed to crawl to them and say you are sorry and you will never again do whatever it is that you did that pissed them off. I'll bet you a dollar to a donut that Sarah was expecting you to do that." 

 "Water under the bridge boss. Too late now." 

 "Do I know this girl?" 

 "I introduced you to her at the Christmas party." 

 "Oh yes; lovely girl. Oh well, if you break up between now and the wedding you really should give Sarah a call." 

 By then lunch period was over and we both got up and went back to work. While finishing my shift I thought about what Russ had told me. I highly doubted that Sarah was waiting for me to crawl back and beg, but I knew from the tapes that Vangie had shown me that Russ and Sarah did talk about me. But that was before Sarah dumped me. Did she still talk about me with her dad? Was she asking about me? And if so why? I'd have to ask Vangie. Not that it would matter at this late date, but I was curious. 

 I rang Vangie's doorbell promptly at eight and she opened the door to greet wearing a smile and her CFM heels. Damn! I would never get tired of looking at that woman. I stood in front of her wearing an overcoat and I opened it and she burst out laughing as said: 

 "Excuse me lady, but I'm the neighborhood pervert. Can I use your bathroom?" 

 I had cut the legs off of an old pair of pants and duct taped them to my knees so it would look like I was dressed under the overcoat. Still laughing she said: 

 "Fuck no. I don't let perverts in my bathroom, but I can always find a place for a pervert in my bedroom." 

 She reached out and took hold of my 'leash' which was in its usual condition when around her and she led me into the house. 

 The weekend was just like the last time I spent a weekend in her house. We made love in every room in the house and on every piece of furniture that would support us. Saturday evening I called out for a pizza and as we ate it I told her about my conversation with Russ at lunch and she told me that Russ was right. 

 "No way! She was very clear and forceful when she ended it. You had to know it. It was your telling her about us that set her off and she was most definite as to why she was breaking things off between us. She made it absolutely clear that having anything at all to do with you was the kiss of death as far as she was concerned." 

 "Oh come on baby; you know that it is a woman's prerogative to change her mind." 

 "So she expected me to try and get her back?" 

 "Maybe not at first, but later yes, she did. The only problem was that she never expected you to be so popular that others would quickly move in to fill the vacuum." 

 "I can't believe that." 

 "Her daddy helped." 

 "Now I know you are pulling my leg." 

 "Hang on a minute; I'll be right back." 

 She got up and left the room and it was almost ten minutes before she came back with two video tapes. 

 "Sorry, but I had to dig through some tapes to find this." 

 She led me out to the living room, turned on the TV and put a tape in the VCR and began to fast forward. She stopped and restarted a couple of times until she came to the place she was looking for. 

 "Here we go; watch this." 

 On the screen Russ and Sarah were lying naked on a bed. Russ was playing with her left breast and she was stroking him trying to get him up. Russ was saying: 

 "You seem a little distant. Thinking of Frank again?" 

 "I can't help it daddy; I love him, but he is a cheating asshole. How could he do that to me?" 

 "I think you made a mistake in breaking up with him." 

 "You think I should have stayed with someone who was unfaithful? Are you nuts?" 

 "Look little girl; you love him and he loved you. Did you give him a chance to explain? Did you give him a chance to ask you for forgiveness? He's a guy and he was still single and there may have been a good reason for what you saw. You say you saw her leave his apartment, but you never saw what went on inside. Maybe she was an old friend who needed a place to stay for a night. Maybe she slept on the couch. You don't know." 

 "But daddy, I kno...." 

 "And how can you bitch at him little girl? What are we doing? Talk about being unfaithful. You are pissed at him for what you think he may have done, but what about what you are doing and have been doing since before you even met him? What about John and Larry? If you love him you should be with him. Look at it this way. If he gets a little on the side so what? You can look at him and smile and know that while he may be getting a little on the side you are getting a lot on the side." 

 Vangie pressed the 'stop' button and ejected the tape. "Of course Russ has no idea of who you were playing with to cause Sarah to end things. I don't think he would feel the same way if he knew." 

 She slid the second tape into the VCR as she said, "I think you'll like this one." 

 On the screen I saw me pounding my cock into Vangie's ass as she was bent over the dinning room table screaming: 

 "Fuck my ass baby, fuck mommy's ass." 

 "You taped us?" 

 "You bet. Some day I'll put them all together so you can have proof that you are a porn star, but right now that picture on the screen is giving me ideas. How about it lover? Want to tap mommy's ass?" 

 Silly question. 

 As I was dressing to leave on Sunday I told Vangie that I didn't know how we would arrange to get together after the wedding, but that I'd find a way. 

 "You are still going to want mommy even though you will have a brand new bride?" 

 "You know the answer to that. Leave Russ and the wedding would be off and I'd have you living with me." 

 "That's sweet Frank, but I do love Russ and I'd never leave him." 

 "Unfortunately I know that, but I can still wish." 

 As I drove home I wondered how a woman old enough to be my mother could have such a hold on me. I also wondered about Sarah and that she was saying she loved me even after she kicked me to the curb. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The weeks went by quickly and then Allison's graduation was upon us. I was sitting with her parents watching as she walked across the stage to be handed her degree. We all went out to dinner afterward and the conversation was mostly about the upcoming wedding and what Allison intended to do with her degree. Allison surprised us all by telling us she had been offered a job at Cutter and Sons and that she had decided to take it and would start the first of next week. 

 Mr. and Mrs. Ames decided to take a motel room and spend the night rather than drive home, but Allison didn't want to stay so we started out on the three hour drive home. We were maybe forty minutes into the drive and had just been talking about the wedding when Allison said: 

 "There is one thing we have never discussed Frankie; we've never talked about children." 

 "What's to talk about?" 

 "The fact that I don't want any. I didn't bust my butt to earn a degree just so I could sit at home and raise kids." 

 "Okay, so you work until you feel ready for kids and then we will have them." 

 "That's not what I'm saying Frankie. I'm saying that I don't want kid's period. None. Never. Not ever." 

 "Don't you think you should have brought this up a little sooner? Say maybe before jumping in feet first to plan a wedding?" 

 "You have never given me any indication that you wanted kids." 

 "I never realized I had to. To me getting married and raising a family is the natural order of things." 

 "Well I'm sorry Frank, but I don't want my life to revolve around kids. I only want to have to concentrate on two things -- my job and my husband." 

 "In that order?" 

 "What?" 

 "The way you just put it; my job and my husband. Is that your list of priorities? The job and then me?" 

 "Don't be silly Frankie; I haven't spent most of my life trying to hook you just so you could play second fiddle to my job." 

 I sat there and steered the truck in silence for a couple of miles and then Allison said: 

 "Talk to me Frankie." 

 I took a deep breath and then said, "It's on you Allison. You get to be the one to tell the moms that they are never going to play with grandchildren and why and I expect you to do it before the wedding." 

 "Why before the wedding?" 

 "Because I think that if I don't push you to do it you won't and a couple of years from now I'll be the one bearing the brunt of "What's wrong Frankie. Why can't you give me a grandchild." I've put up with seventeen years of the two of them pushing and shoving the two of us together and I am not going to go through twenty years of "Where are my grandbabies." You just dumped it on me so you get to be the one to dump it on them. I'll accept it, but I want it out in the open right at the start." 

 I don't think she expected me to take the stand I took and the rest of the trip home was made in silence. 

 But she did it. She told both mothers and when the two of them got after me to "talk some sense into that girl" I just shrugged and said: 

 "It is her body and if she doesn't want to use it to make babies it is strictly up to her and you need to take it up with her and not me." 

 Three days before the wedding some buds of mine threw me a bachelor party. It started at nine, but I spent from six until eight-thirty in a motel room with Vangie. As I was dressing she said: 

 "You will miss mommy won't you?" 

 "You have to ask? What is most on my mind right now is how we are going to manage when I get back from the honeymoon. I've got to come up with some way we can get together." 

 Vangie giggled and said, "Ask your wife if you can have one night a week to go out and play." 

 "I just hope that I don't have to settle for one night a week. It isn't too late Vangie. I can skip the wedding and you and I can set up housekeeping." 

 "You already know the answer to that one lover." 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 After a couple of more discussions on the subject of children I finally accepted that Allison wasn't going to change her mind and my wedding gift to her was a vasectomy. 

 The wedding went off as planned and the honeymoon in Aruba was fantastic and then Allison and I settled in to begin our new life as man and wife. We decided what we wanted in the way of a house, got a price range for it and then started saving money for a down payment. 

 I took all the overtime I that was offered which meant that I worked late several nights a week and I put all the overtime money in the 'house fund". Usually two, but always at least one of those late nights was spent in a motel room with Vangie. 

 The first night that Vangie and I got together after getting back from my honeymoon she told me that Sarah had been crossing her fingers that something would happen and the wedding would be cancelled, but when it finally dawned in her that I was no longer available she hooked up with some guy named Melvin and they had eloped to Las Vegas and had gotten married. 

 "How is Russ handling it now that he has been cut off?" 

 "She hasn't cut him off. She hasn't cut off John or Larry either. Poor Melvin is getting all the sloppy seconds he can handle. Not that he knows it of course." 

 "And you didn't play your little game with him and then rat him out?" 

 "I never even got to know him before they eloped, but I wouldn't have gone after him anyway. I didn't like him and besides, I've settled on you for my full time lover. You need to get used to it. You won't ever share me with anyone but Russ." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two years slid by and my marriage to Allison hummed right along. She was doing well in her job and I was doing fine in mine. I averaged six nights a month with Vangie and wished it could be more even though Allison and I made love three or four times a week. 

 The money in the down payment fund grew and finally reached a point where we could seriously start looking for the house we wanted. We finally found one; a three bedroom ranch with a two car garage and a full basement and it was in an area that we liked. We made an offer and it was accepted, we arranged financing, closed and moved in. 

 Three months after moving in to the house Allison came home from work one night and said: 

 "We need to talk Frank." 

 What the fuck did I do now I thought as I said, "About what my love?" 

 "I've been offered a promotion and I have to talk it over with you before I either take it or turn it down." 

 "Why do you have to talk to me about it' it's your job, not mine." 

 "It's a great move. It is eighteen hundred a month more than I'm making now and it comes with a company car and a company credit card for gas and upkeep." 

 "So what's to talk about? Take it." 

 "There is a drawback Frank. I'd have to travel." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "Several times a month I would have to travel and meet with vendors. It would mean I would be traveling anywhere from two to three days a week every other week or so." 

 "A fixed schedule? Something like a route?" 

 "No. I would depend on which vendors Quality Assurance wanted looked at and when. It could be leave on Monday and be home by Tuesday or Wednesday or it could mean leave on Tuesday and come home on Thursday or Friday. Every once in a while it might mean fly out Sunday night and not get home until Friday although Amos (her boss) says that won't happen all that often." 

 "So where do I come in?" 

 "It is time we will be apart Frankie and you should have some say in that." 

 "It is your job Allie. I have no problem with it as long as it does not have a major impact on our life. By that I mean things like you being gone two, three or four days and then coming home and telling me that you are too tired and worn out to do this or that. I know that it will happen occasionally and I'll do my best to be understanding, but not if it becomes a habit." 

 "I won't let that happen Frank; I promise you that." 

 I knew she was whistling in the dark on that one; I knew too many people who had traveling jobs and I knew what was likely to happen, but I could live with it. Why? Vangie of course. It wouldn't matter if Allie came home from a trip and told me she was too tired to do anything more than go soak in the tub, because I would be getting all I could handle every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday that Allie was out of town.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 05 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Allison took the job and I have to give her credit; she did not let the job interfere with our home life other than being gone a lot. 

 Maybe a year after the wedding Vangie started asking me how the marriage was going. I told her fine and asked her why she was asking. 

 "Just wondered." 

 "Come on Vang; there has to be more to it than that." 

 "You will laugh at me." 

 "Probably." 

 "You know that Sarah got so upset at your getting married and not to her that she lost her mind and eloped to Vegas and got married." 

 I nodded a yes and she said, "Even married she still talks about you a lot with her dad. She asks how you are doing. She asks if he has heard how your marriage is doing. He asked her why and she told him if it went bad and you suddenly became free she would be on you like a duck on a June bug." 

 "You have to be kidding. It has been almost four years since she cut me loose. And what about her hubby? How is she going to come after me if she is married?" 

 "I get the impression that her marriage to Melvin isn't all that great. If you were available I bet she would drop him like a hot rock." 

 "I don't believe it." 

 "I know, but I know from the surveillance tapes that she misses you and knows she made a bad mistake in letting you go. If your marriage went south I could still end up as your mother-in-law." 

 "Never happen. I would have to give you up and I won't do that." 

 "Why would you have to give me up? I'd be willing to bet she won't give up her father." 

 "There is a major difference. She knows what we were doing and she knows I know she knows. She has no clue that we know about her and Russ. Knowing our past she would watch me like a hawk when I was around you while working her ass off to hide what she is doing with Russ. Not to mention John, Larry and the frat house boys." 

 "She hasn't done the frat house thing in over two years." 

 "But she is still doing John and Larry, right?" 

 "Still doing them." 

 "Only way I could end up your son-in-law would be for Sarah to come to an agreement with me that I could stay your lover in return for me not saying anything about John and Larry. I wouldn't let her know that I know about Russ, but I would find some way to 'discover' John and Larry." 

 "All I can say lover is that stranger things have happened." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 About three months after that conversation I saw a side of Vangie I didn't know existed. Allison was on a two day trip to Chicago and it was Wednesday evening -- Russ's Fraternal Order of Eagles night -- and Vangie was resting after giving me her ass. She seemed a little distant and I asked her what was wrong. She said "nothing" but I knew something was there so I kept after her. 

 "It's Sarah. Someone got her pregnant and she got rid of it and had her tubes tied at the same time." 

 "So?" 

 "So it means that I'm never going to have grandbabies. I've always looked forward to having grandbabies." 

 I found that surprising. If that was the case why had she gone out of her way to break up every romance that Sarah got into? If you wanted grandchildren you needed for your daughter to get married so she could have kids. But I kept my mouth shut. I wasn't about to say something that might cause Vangie to leave and not come back. Still, she did seem down on knowing that Sarah wouldn't give her grandchildren. But not so down that she didn't ask me to butt fuck her a second time." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 My willingness to work all available overtime and tackle any problem that came up was seen as 'go gettedness' by management and I was give a promotion to section manager and it was a promotion that had far reaching effects. 

 Three months after the promotion all management level personnel had to attend a management seminar. It was being held in one of the meeting rooms at a local hotel and since it was being held during regular working hours I didn't bother to mention it to Allison. About two I left the room to use the restroom and as I was coming out of the bathroom I was looking in the direction of the elevators when the elevator doors opened and I saw Allison in the elevator with her boss. They were kissing. They walked out of the elevator holding hands and headed for the entrance. 

 I walked over to the registration desk and asked the woman behind the counter if my uncle had checked in yet. 

 "His name? 

 "Amos Campbell." 

 She tapped a few computer keys and then said, "Yes; I have him in room 346." 

 I went back to the seminar, but I'm not sure I got much out of the session since my mind seemed to be elsewhere. When the session was over I stopped for drinks at the hotel bar with several others more to delay going home that for any other reason. I had a couple beers while we dissected the seminar and we all seemed to have reached the same conclusion; that the 'so-called experts' who put on the seminar had no idea of went on in the real world. 

 I called it quits after the second beer and got up to head for the house. I had no idea what I was going to do or say when I got there. Not that it mattered. When I got home Allison wasn't there, but in the center of the kitchen table was a six pack of Bud Light with a note leaning against it. The note read: 

 "I thought you might need the beer." Interesting I thought; no "Dear Frank" or any other type of salutation. The note continued: 

 "I'm pretty much of a coward so I'm taking the easy way out. I saw you this afternoon and I know what you saw. I was also outside looking in when you went to the front desk so I know that you know. I'm sorry. I hoped that you would never find out although after my visit to the doctor on Monday it is inevitable that you would. Amos and I got careless and I'm pregnant. So as I said, I'm taking the coward's way out and you get this note instead of a confrontation. Again, I'm sorry Frankie, more than I can say" and it was signed Allison. 

 That changed everything. Given what I had going with Vangie there was no way I was going to be hypocritical and go all Attila the Hun on Allison. We would have talked it over and worked by it somehow (without my mentioning my long term affair with Vangie of course) and our marriage would have gone on. 

 But her being pregnant changed all that. I reluctantly went along with what she wanted where children were concerned even to the extent of putting myself under the knife and she lets another man knock her up? Well fuck her! I went instantly from the "We can work it out" mode to the "Scorched Earth" mode and my first step in the process was to call my mother-in-law. When she answered the phone I said: 

 "Congratulations grandma." 

 "Frankie? Is that you?" 

 "Indeed it is. Just calling to let you know you are going to be a grandmother after all. Allison is pregnant." 

 "I thought you weren't able to do that." 

 "I'm not, but her boss was able to do it. She packed up and left me so if you can find out where she is maybe you can get to her before she decides to get rid of it. Got to run. Bye." 

 A quick check of the house showed that all of her clothing and personal items were gone. I debated calling a locksmith and having the locks changed, but by then I had calmed down. Allison had as much right to the house and what was in it as I did so I wasn't going to lock her out although I did hope she wouldn't come by anytime soon. 

 I opened one of the beers Allison had so thoughtfully provided, sat down and thought about what I needed to do. There would be a divorce, but we lived in a no-fault state so everything would be divided up equally so I didn't bother with cancelling credit cards, but I would do something about our money to make sure I didn't get put into a bind. I had a separate account that my Guard pay had been put into by direct deposit and I had never closed it out. 

 I got on the phone and did some electronic banking. I transferred all the money in our savings into our joint checking and then I figured out what he next month's house payment and utilities would be and subtracted that from the total in checking and then I took that amount and half of the remaining balance and transferred it into my Guard account. I don't know what a lawyer would say about it, but the house was in both of our names and the payments would still need to be made until the divorce was settled so all I had done was to insure that the next month's payment would be available and I doubted that the courts would find anything wrong with that. 

 Thinking of money reminded me of something and I went to the bedroom that we had made into a home office and opened the safe in the closet. All six of the certificates of deposit were there so either Allison had forgotten about them or she was intending to play fair in the breakup. To be on the safe side I took three of them and left the other three in case she came back for them. I'd take my three and get me a deposit box at the bank for them. 

 I finished the second of Allison's beers while I fixed myself some dinner. I was just sitting down to eat when the phone rang. 

 "Hello?" 

 "That was a rotten thing for you to do." 

 "And good evening to you to Allison." 

 "Why did you call my mother?" 

 "You didn't want me to share the good news with her? You know how much she wanted to be a grandmother. I just wanted her to know that she had gotten her wish." 

 "That was a mean and nasty thing to do." 

 "Probably. Just as mean and nasty as what you did to me. However, on the bright side, at least as I see it, I can do even more mean and nasty stuff. I can sue Amos for alienation of affections. I can sue your company for not enforcing the morals clause in your company policy and procedures manual and allowing a relationship between a supervisor and some one who works under his direct supervision. 

 "I think it is ironic that the baby you wouldn't let me give you because it would interfere with you career was given to you by some one who was part of that career and that the baby he gave you will end that career." 

 "What the hell does that mean Frank?" 

 "When I sue Cutter and Sons do you honestly think they won't fire both you and Amos?" 

 "You wouldn't!" 

 "Of course I would Allison. Right now I'm pissed off enough to do almost anything." 

 "Don't do it Frank; please don't do it. If you sue Amos his wife will leave him." 

 "So what you are saying is that it is okay for him to fuck up my marriage, but not okay for me to screw up his? Sorry Allison, but I'm not buying it." 

 "Don't do it Frank; please don't do it. I'm begging you." 

 "Goodnight Allison" I said as I hung up the phone. It started ringing almost immediately and I took it off the hook and went back to eating my dinner. 

 I drank the third of Allison's beers while I ate dinner and thought about the situation. I had no intention of suing Amos or her company, but she didn't know that. It would be a useful club to hold over her head to insure that she didn't give me a hard time over the divorce, but I was right when I said that a suit would most likely cost her her job and I saw no real reason to do that to her. She would need that job after the divorce. 

 My anger wasn't over what she was doing with Amos. God knows my skirts weren't clean when it came to marital fidelity and I'm sure that we would have been able to get by what she did with Amos, but there was no way to get by the pregnancy. 

 After I had cleaned up my dishes and was on the fourth beer from the six pack when the door bell rang. I went to the door, opened it and found Allison standing there. I turned and walked back into the kitchen, sat down at the table and picked up my beer. Allison walked into the house, closed the door behind her and followed me into the kitchen. 

 "What the hell did you ring the bell for? You have a key to the house." 

 "I didn't think I would be welcome." 

 "If you thought that why the hell are you here?" 

 She sat down across from me and said, "When you started talking lawsuits I knew I had to get over here and try to talk you out of it." 

 As she was talking she reached for one of the two beers left in the six pack and I snarled: 

 "Get your hand away from my beer. They were given to me so I could use them to morn my failed marriage and I'm not going to share them." 

 Allison snatched her hand back like she had touched a hot stove. 

 "And why would you think that you could talk me out of lawsuits?" 

 "I don't know if I can, but I have to try. If you divorce me I'm going to need a job." 

 "If I divorce you? You have doubts?" 

 "No, I guess I don't." 

 "Tell me why I should spare Amos, and for that matter why would you worry about his wife leaving him? If she did you could be together and wouldn't have to sneak off to hotels during the day." 

 "I don't love Amos. It was a mistake that we let carry us away. It was a fling that would most likely have ended in another couple of weeks." 

 "Until you slipped up. How is Amos going to explain his new little one to his wife?" 

 "I doubt he will ever tell her. She will never know unless you sue him and it comes out." 

 "Okay, so we are back to why I should give a shit about Amos's marriage after he fucked up mine?" 

 "Because it isn't his fault. I seduced him. He didn't come after me; I went after him and don't look at me like that. It had nothing to do with love and you should know that. At least you should. I've been in love with you since I was six or seven. I didn't screw Amos because of love, but because I was horny. I love you Frank; always have, always will." 

 "Whatever Allison. Love or lust; it just doesn't matter at this point." 

 "It matters to me Frank. I love you and I need you to know that. I need you to know that it wasn't anything you did that made what happened happen. It was on one of those rare week long trips I went on. Amos and a couple of others were on the trip also. Every night we would go back to the hotel, have dinner and a few drinks together before going to our rooms and one night I had a few more drinks than I should have. The hotel lounge had a live band and I drug all of the men in the group out onto the dance floor. The guys had drunk enough that they were in a good mood and the dances got a little raunchy. I got felt up some and by the time it was Amos's turn to dance with me I was just a little bit horny from all the touching. While dancing with Amos his cock accidently poked me a time or two and it tripped a switch in me somewhere and I seduced him. 

 "Don't blame him Frank. He's a man and he has a dick and when a man's dick is hard his dick does all of his thinking. That's true of all men Frank, even you, and once a man's dick starts doing the thinking a woman -- any woman -- can take him down. Six weeks later we again ended up on a trip together and on the second night I was horny so I said "why not, it didn't hurt anything the first time" so I went after Amos again. After that every time we were on a trip together -- maybe once every three months or so -- we did it. Until today it was only on trips." 

 "What was different today?" 

 "I found out I was pregnant and had to let him know and talk about what to do." There was a short pause and then she said, "It had nothing to do with you Frank. I swear to God that nothing you did or didn't do caused me to do it." Another pause and then, "So I'm asking you Frank; no, I'm begging you. Please don't start any lawsuits." 

 I stared at her for a bit and then said, "I'll think about it, but as long as you are here there are some things you need to know." I explained what I'd done money-wise and then said, "I'm going to open a new account at the bank and call it the household account. This is the cost of maintaining the house for a month." 

 I slid a piece of paper with the numbers I'd come up with across the table to her. 

 "From now on you need to put half of that amount into the account every month until the divorce decides who gets what. Tomorrow I will make an appointment to see an attorney and after talking to him I'll let you know about what I'm going to do lawsuit wise. Now, if you don't mind I have two bottles of beer to finish before I go to bed. This is still your house until the final decisions are made and you can have the spare bedroom if you would like. All I ask is that you do your best to avoid me when we are in the house together." 

 "I can't do that. I can't be around you and not want to be close." 

 She got up and headed for the door and when she got to it she turned and said: 

 "I'm sorry Frank. I'm really, really sorry" and then she left the house. I finished the six pack that she had provided and then I went to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next morning I called and made an appointment with an attorney and he informed me that I was correct in what I'd thought about no fault divorces. Assets and liabilities would be split fifty-fifty; each side would be responsible for their attorney fees, but that since I was the one filing I would be responsible for court costs. I told him to go ahead and write it up and I'd let him know where he could have Allison served. 

 The phone calls started around three. The first was from my mother asking me to stop by the house after work. When I asked why she gave me a song and dance about how it had been a while since she had seen me and wouldn't I like one of her home cooked meals. 

 The second was from my mother-in-law asking me if I could stop by and see her after work. I knew what was going on so I told her I would be at moms after work "and you both can take your shot at me there." 

 The third was from Amos. He said he realized he was not on my 'favorite persons list', but he would like to meet me for a drink so he could personally apologize to me and he said there was also something he wanted to discuss with me. He had balls I'd give him that. It took some pretty big stones to call the man you had fucked over and ask him to see you for a drink. I told him that the anger and rage that was boiling in me at the time would almost guarantee that I would go for his throat if I came within fifty feet of him so a meeting between us would not be a good thing and I hung up on him. 

 Five minutes later the phone rang again and it was Allison. "I understand you hung up on Amos." 

 "News travels fast." 

 "I was sitting across the desk from him when he called you. Actually I put him up to it since I didn't have the guts to do it myself." 

 "What do you want Allison?" 

 "I want you to meet with Amos and me. We need to talk to you." 

 "What could we possibly talk about? I know what the two of you did and I know the outcome. I can't see what else you could tell me other than the details and I can assure you that I don't want to hear those." 

 "It's none of that. Please Frank, it won't take up much of your time and I promise you I'll leave you alone after we meet." 

 I really didn't want to sit down with Allison and Amos, but there is just something about curiosity that pulls you into things you don't want to get into. 

 "All right. The Denny's on Hawthorne at five." 

 "We don't get off until five and then it takes ten minutes to get there." 

 "I'll be there at five and if I'm still alone three minutes later I'll be leaving." 

 "Oh come on Fra..." I hung up the phone, called my mom and told her I'd be there around six and then I made the most important call of the day. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hi. It's me. I'm sorry, but something has come up and I won't be able to see you tonight." 

 "Damn baby, mommy was so looking forward to seeing you." 

 "Well I do have some good news for you. We will be able to see each other more often starting tomorrow." 

 "Oh? What's going on?" 

 "I'm about to be single again. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow." 

 "I can't wait to hear about it. Kisses lover." 

 "Back atcha. Bye" 

 I got to the Denny's at three minutes to five and saw that Allison and Amos were already there. They were sitting in a booth opposite each other. No way I was going to sit next to either of them. I wanted to be looking at both of them when they brought up whatever it was they had in mind. When I got to the booth I pointed at the other side of the table and said to Allison:  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 05 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Move." 

 She got an annoyed look on her face, but then she took notice of the look on mine and she got up and moved. I sat down and looked at the two of them and then said: 

 "Okay. Let's hear it." 

 "First" Amos said, "I want to..." 

 "Save it! It wouldn't matter to me any way. What is this about?" 

 The two of them looked at each other and then Allison said, "We are asking you not to sue Amos and the company, but there is more. We want you to stay married to me until after the baby is born and to allow your name to be put on the baby's birth certificate as the father." 

 "Are you out of your fucking mind?!!" 

 "Please Frank; hear me out on this. Amos's wife wants another child. Because of complications when she had her last one she can't have another. She and Amos have been looking at adoption, but there are so many hoops to jump through and long waiting lists they aren't making much progress. I want to have the baby and then let Amos and his wife have it. For obvious reasons we can't put Amos's name on the birth certificate without his wife finding out about it. If I put down 'father unknown' it will create problems when I go to give the baby up. We would have to pretend to be making an attempt to find the baby's father to get his permission. It could take up to a year before they would accept that the father wasn't going to show up. If we stay married and then you sign off on the adoption things will go much quicker." 

 "Give me one good reason why I should go along with what you want." 

 "Because we can make it worth while for you." 

 "How do you plan to do that?" 

 "We did some checking on our own and we found that alienation of affection suits rarely succeed in this state unless there are some really bad aspects to the case. At best you might get ten thousand out of it and typically a third of that will go to your attorney. Secondly, to be successful in a suit against our company you would have to prove that management knew about the affair and did nothing about it and I can assure you that Amos and I kept what we did very quiet. All your suit would do is cost us our jobs. If you do what we have just proposed we will divorce after the baby comes and has been given up for adoption. In the divorce I will voluntarily give up my share of the proceeds from the sale of the house. Given the current market you should be able to get two hundred and fifty thousand for the house and our current equity is about sixty thousand and that's almost forty thousand more than you would be likely to get if you filed suit. Also, if I lost my job you would end up paying me alimony. 

 "You aren't a stupid man Frank. You can see that this is a winning situation for you. What do you say Frank?" 

 "I don't know. When I talked to the attorney all we talked about was the divorce. I think I'm going to want to check out what you've told me with my own lawyer. I'll get back to you on it." 

 I got up and walked out of the restaurant. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was right. When I walked into my parent's house I found both sets of parents waiting for me. My dad started it out. 

 "How about bringing us up to speed on what is going on. Your phone call to Martha upset a lot of people." 

 "Not much to tell. Allison had an affair with her boss and he got her pregnant. I found out." 

 "What are you going to do?" Mr. Ames asked 

 "Divorce her." 

 "What about the baby?" Mrs. Ames asked. 

 "Not my concern. You need to discuss that with Allison." 

 "Is there any way you can work things out with Allison and avoid a divorce? 

 "There might have been a chance if it was only the affair, but not a chance with her being pregnant. She made it absolutely clear before we were married that she didn't want kids -- not ever! She even encouraged me to get a vasectomy so she wouldn't have to mess with birth control pills, diaphragms, spermicides and the like. I did it and then she goes and gets knocked up by her boss. So no, not a chance. Not even a smidgen of a chance." 

 "Maybe you should take a little time to think about it" my mother said. "Not rush into it. Okay, she made a mistake, but you two are young and you have been together for so long. It would be a shame to see it end now over a simple little mistake -- an error in judgment -- that I'm sure that she regrets. Maybe you should think about giving things a chance." 

 "I don't believe you people. My wife is walking around carrying another man's child -- a child she denied me -- and you are all acting like what she did is no more serious that putting a ding in the car door in the grocery store parking lot. Well it is a hell of a lot more serious than that to me. As far as I'm concerned a divorce is going to happen" 

 I got up and headed for the door. "Where are you going" my mother asked, "We haven't eaten yet." 

 "I'm not hungry. I've lost my appetite. Goodnight." 

 I left the house and as I climbed into my truck I was thinking that they would never give up trying to tie Allison and me together. "Can you work it out?" God but I had to laugh at that. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 First thing in the morning I called and made another appointment with my attorney. He gave me the same information that Allison had gotten from whoever it was she talked to only my attorney said that Allison's pregnancy would work in our favor as a special circumstance in an alienation of affection suit and the fact that Amos was Allison's direct supervisor would be a major factor in a suit against Cutter and Sons. He said that either one would be a gamble, but we probably had a better than even chance to prevail in both suits. O f course he would say that I thought. It would increase his fees by handling the suits. As for the offer Allison made concerning the house it was not legally enforceable. She could renege on it and I'd have no recourse. I told him to put the divorce on hold until I could think things out. 

 I went back to work and around two in the afternoon I called Vangie and arranged for her to meet me that evening. 

 "Tell me about being single again" she said when she walked into the motel room. I filled her in on what was happening and she said: 

 "You poor baby. Let mommy cheer you up." 

 After two hours of being cheered up Vangie started to dress and as she was dressing she said: 

 "What is your situation going to mean for us?" 

 "It means that we can see each other whenever you want." 

 "Are we going to use your place?" 

 "No. Too great a chance that Allison would find out about you. I don't want to give her anything to use against me. I want to keep her on the defensive until the divorce is over." 

 "Then I'll see you Monday?" 

 "Absolutely." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Friday at lunch I called Lou Marks. Lou had been in the Guard with me and he worked in real estate. I got him to agree to meet me at the house on Saturday and give me some idea of what the house was worth and what it would be likely to go for if I put it up for sale. 

 Allison was a bit off on her idea of what the house was worth. Lou told me that I could probably put it up for sale for three hundred thousand and move it quickly. I told him to start the mechanics of putting it on the market. 

 I spent the rest of the weekend working on the house getting it ready for sale and Monday I called Allison on her cell. 

 "My attorney doesn't agree with your attorney, but I have decided not to take the chance that your lawyer might be better than mine or that the jury, should it go to trail, might be full of dumb shits. But what my attorney did tell me was that the deal you offered me would not be legally enforceable and come time to do it you could say you changed your mind and I would be hosed so here is what I have come up with. 

 "I'm going to hold off on the divorce until your baby problem is solved, but I'm putting the house up for sale now and I'm going to price it to sell. At closing they will give us a check for our equity and we will take it to the bank where you will endorse it and I will deposit it into an account that is in my name only. After that the money will disappear. Gambling debts most likely. A couple weekend trips to Vegas should see to that. That way there won't be any bullshit at divorce time about me hiding assets from you." 

 "You don't trust me Frank?" 

 "Of course I don't trust you. You are walking around carrying another man's kid, right? Anyway, the sale goes off, you endorse the check and I hold off on the divorce and forget about the lawsuits. You give me any problems at sale time and all bets are off." 

 "Thank you Frank." 

 I hung up without saying anything else. 

 At eleven I got a call from Vangie. "Looking forward to seeing mommy tonight?" 

 "You know I am." 

 "Tonight I want you to meet me at 402 Wilcox." 

 "Why? What's up?" 

 "It's a surprise." 

 I pulled up in front of 402 Wilcox at six and found Vangie sitting in her Porsche waiting for me. 402 was an apartment house and I wondered what was up as Vangie got out of her car to walk over to me as I got out of my truck. 

 "Not a word" she said, "Just follow me." 

 She used a key on the front door and led me down the first floor hallway and stopped in front of Apartment 1 D. She handed me a key and told me to unlock the door. I did it and we walked inside. 

 "What are we doing here Vangie?" 

 "It's our love nest. I rented it furnished. Now that I can have you whenever I want I decided that since we can't use your place and motel rooms would bankrupt you I got us a place to play. You would like to play with Mommy wouldn't you?" 

 "You know the answer to that." 

 "I took a one year lease on it and I can renew. It should do for us until you can get your divorce out of the way." 

 "How can you hide the expense from Russ?" 

 "You forget what I once told you lover. I have the money in the family. My father left me oodles and oodles and I don't have to account for any of it except to myself. Want a new truck lover? Treat mommy right and who knows." 

 "My truck might be eight years old, but it runs great and best of all I don't have any payments to make." 

 "What? You think I'd give you a truck and then make you pay for it? Well, maybe, but I'll bet you would like making the payments I have in mind. Maybe I'll put one under the Christmas tree for you." 

 "All I want under my tree is you." 

 "And what would you do with me lover? You only see me three times a week as it is and I leave you a wreck. If you had to keep up with me full time I'd put you in an early grave." 

 "But what a great way to go." 

 "You know why I keep you baby? It is because you say the sweetest things. But enough talk. We need to test the bed." 

 The bed held up under a very rigorous test. 

 Resting between bouts Vangie surprised the hell out of me when she said: 

 "Would you still like for me to be your mother-in-law?" 

 "What?" 

 "Sarah's marriage is over. She and Melvin finally decided to call it quits. She should be available by the time your divorce is over." 

 "Why is their marriage ending?" 

 "Melvin is a jealous, possessive and suspicious man and he is constantly accusing Sarah of cheating on him and she finally got tired of it and told him she was done with him." 

 "Has she?" 

 "Has she what?" 

 "Has she been cheating on him?" 

 "Of course she has. She is still doing her dad, John and Larry only by now it has been going on so long that I'm sure she doesn't think of it as cheating. It is just something that she does that he doesn't need to know about." 

 "Given that why would I want to marry her?" 

 "Why wouldn't you? I seem to remember your being just a little upset with me after I told you about what she and Russ were doing. If I remember correctly your exact words were: 

 "I was all set to spend the rest of my life fucking the two sexiest women I've ever met." 

 "I guess I did say that didn't I." 

 "So what has changed? Remember what Russ said in the video? About you having something on the side and her having something on the side?" 

 "You're serious about this?" 

 "Best way I can think of to keep us close. What would happen to us if you met someone else and got married and we couldn't find a way to get together? Think about it while mommy sucks your dick." 

 To be continued...  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 06 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I put the house on the market for 310 thousand and it sat for two months before I got what I considered a serious offer. I had several offers of 280 and 285, but I didn't pay any attention to them. I got one for 295, but the bidder wanted a new roof on the house as part of the deal so I passed. I finally got an offer for 300 and I took it. Closing was to be in thirty days so I started looking for another place to live. I started looking at apartments and Vangie asked me why. 

 "I don't want another house. A single guy living in a house doesn't make any sense to me." 

 "You need to stop thinking about what makes sense and start thinking about dollars and cents. If you don't take what you get out of your house and roll it over into another piece of property you will end up paying capital gains tax on the money. You don't want another house; look for a condo. You should know by now it is better to pay for something you will end up owning than pay rent and end up with nothing but rent receipts." 

 "I need to be out by closing and until we close I won't have the money for a condo, but I do have enough to get into an apartment." 

 "Sometimes I have to wonder about you." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "Where are you right now?" 

 "In your apartment." 

 "Well duh!!" 

 "Oh. You mean I should move in here?" 

 "He gets it! My baby finally gets it. Now that we have that settled maybe you can follow mommy into the bedroom and show me some thanks." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 A week before closing I called Allison on her cell and told her she had three days to pick out what she wanted out of the house and get it out. 

 "What are you going to keep?" 

 "Whatever is left when you finish. Three days Allison. Anything still there after three days I'll be moving out and into storage." 

 For those three days I stayed at the apartment so I wouldn't run into Allison. Two days before closing I moved all my clothes and personal items to the apartment and moved everything else into storage. 

 Allison met me at the title company on the day of closing and then she followed me to the bank where she endorsed the $74,881.64 check and I deposited it into my Guard account. We didn't talk even though it was clear that she wanted to and I left the bank and went back to work. 

 That weekend I took nine thousand and went to Vegas for the weekend and when I came home I put $7800 in cash into a safe deposit box in a different bank. Over the next two months I took trips to Vegas and Central City in Colorado and at the end of those two months I had $69,400 in the safe deposit box and a pile of receipts for hotel rooms, meals and airfare from places where they had legal gambling. If anyone wanted to know where the money from the sale of the house went I'd just have to admit to being the worst gambler ever. Just couldn't catch a break at the tables. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 The months rolled by and in early October I got a surprising phone call. It was from Amos's wife and she asked me if I could meet her for lunch. Again, curiosity won out. We met at the Red Robin on Fairfield. She told me I would recognize her because she would be wearing a Raider's sweatshirt and a Giant's ball cap. 

 I spotted her as soon as I walked into the restaurant. She was a damned good looking woman and as I walked toward the table I wondered just what she could want to talk with me about. I introduced myself and she told me her name was Becky and she motioned for me to take a seat. She waited until we had ordered and then said: 

 "I'll bet you are wondering why I wanted this meeting." 

 "It is a bet you would win." 

 "I just wanted to meet Allison's husband. I wanted to find out just how you feel about giving up your baby." 

 I wanted – really, really wanted – to tell her that it wasn't my baby, but held my tongue. 

 "I guess my feelings are ones of relief." 

 "Relief? Why would you feel relieved that your wife is giving up your child?" 

 "I am a firm believer in a woman's right to do what she wishes as far as her body is concerned, but I am still somewhat of a 'right to life' person. I would rather see the child given up for adoption than for the alternative to happen." 

 "That doesn't answer my question. I guess I need to put it more plainly. Why don't you want the child?" 

 "Because I would be a lousy father. I don't want kids in my life and I made that perfectly clear to Allison before we got married. I was going to get a vasectomy, but Allison begged me not to. She felt that a few years down the road I might change my mind about having kids. She said she would take care of the birth control so I wouldn't have to get snipped. Her birth control methods failed. I did not react well when she told me that she was pregnant." 

 "Fascinating! You managed to say all that and still keep a straight face." 

 "What is that supposed to mean?" 

 "It means that I know that Amos is the father of the child and I know that you know it. The real purpose behind my wanting to see you was to try and find out just how bad you intend to screw up my life when you go after Amos to get your revenge against him." 

 "And how pray tell can you know a thing like that?" 

 "Because I have had a private investigator on Amos off and on for almost a year now. He just happened to be on Amos the day you saw your wife with him at the hotel and he saw you go to the front counter to check on them. He gave the counter person a twenty to tell him what you asked about and since we know Amos isn't your uncle it wasn't hard to figure out." 

 "That just means that I caught them cheating and just because Allison was cheating on me doesn't mean that the baby isn't mine." 

 "Some investigators are willing to bend or even break the rules to get the client what she wants. My guy bribed some one at Cutter to slip a bug in your wife's purse. I have her on tape telling Amos about their little mistake and I have her on tape confessing to you. That means I also have you on tape telling her about the lawsuits you are going to file. It also goes without saying that I have your meeting at Denny's on tape. What I don't have is your response to the offer they made you. I need to know what you are going to do." 

 "I decided to accept it. There will be no lawsuits. Now I have a question; a couple of them actually. The first is if you know all this why haven't you kicked him out? The fact you have an investigator on him indicates to me that you are building a case against him and that being so brings up the second question. What is all this about adoption if you are dumping Amos?" 

 "I have no intension of getting rid of Amos. He is a good husband, if a trifle weak, and he is an excellent father and I love the man. The adoption is because we really want another child and I can't have one. I have a detective on him because I got suspicious. His behavior changed and he seemed unsettled. My intuition told me that there was a woman involved and I decided to find out if I was right and if I was would she be a threat to me and my family. What I found out is that your wife is no threat. It was just a fling that would have died in another month or so. Amos and Allison had already started talking about ending things before you and I could somehow find out." 

 "I don't understand the adoption part. Why would you want Allison's baby?" 

 "Why not? It will have Amos's DNA and that is something no other adopted child would have." 

 "But won't it be a constant reminder of what Amos did?" 

 "It will, but I can handle it. Amos will never know that I know the truth so it won't be on his mind." 

 "Not that I need to know, but I am curious about the adoption. Is it legal for Allison to have a baby and just give it to you?" 

 "No, she can't just hand it to me and walk away. There are some legalities involved and there are attorney's that specialize in cases like this. That's why they wanted you to give your name to the baby; so you could sign off on the paperwork and speed up the process." 

 "Well all I can say to you is good luck." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Months past and for the most part it was work and spend three evenings a week with Vangie. I still had two classes remaining to get my degree and I was taking them during the summer term on Tuesdays and Fridays. There was an occasional Saturday or Sunday with Vangie and there was one full weekend which we spent at her house doing everything we had done the previous two times I had been able to spend time here. 

 We had another conversation about Sarah on that weekend. "Sarah's divorce will be final in December." 

 "I'll be just starting mine. Allison's baby is due around the first of December and as soon as I sign off on the adoption I'll be filing." 

 "Sarah intends to make a play for you. She doesn't know about your upcoming divorce; she just plans on being a home wrecker. Seduce you and make sure your wife finds out and kicks you out then she will move in." 

 "Still taping her?" 

 "I never took the system out. The cameras are motion activated and they come on any time someone walks into the room where there is one. I checked the recorders once a week just to see if Sarah stops by when Russ is home and I'm not. Now that she has moved back in while going through her divorce I'm back to checking them daily. She told her dad she is going to get you back." 

 "And how do you feel about that?" 

 "You already know lover. She will have her extracurricular activities and we will have ours." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 With Allison gone and me only seeing Vangie three times a week I had a lot of time to myself on the weekends and I spent a lot of it thinking about life in general and how it pertained to me. I considered myself an average guy. I didn't have movie star good looks and looking at things honestly I didn't see that I had all that much to offer and yet look at what had gone on and was going on in my life. 

 Actively pursued by four beautiful and sexy women at one time or another and they had all gotten me. I'd married two of them and had almost married a third and all three of them cheated on me after they got me. The fourth didn't cheat on me (unless you want to consider what she did with her husband as cheating on me), but we cheated when we were together. The question could be asked "What was wrong with them?" but it was a question that I couldn't ask because I was no better and I knew it. Never mind what was in them – what was it in me? I cared for the three – the two I married and the one I almost married – but did I love them? I honestly don't know. 

 I'm not even sure that I know what love is unless it is the way I feel about Vangie. I can't wait to see her again and I hate it when she leaves after spending time with me. I willingly cheated on Sarah and Allison with Vangie and I knew I would always cheat with Vangie no matter who I was with. A married woman older than my mother and all she had to do was crook a finger for me to come and I went. I've said it before – the woman owned me and always would. God only knows why she spent her time with me. She says that she does it to keep the scales balanced between her and her husband and I guess I can understand that, but why with me? That's the part I'll never understand. The woman was a sex Goddess; she could have any man she wanted so again, why me? I'd probably never know, but I was going to hang on and ride it till the end. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 On December 3rd Allison had her baby. It was a boy and he came in at eight pounds seven ounces. For appearances sake I was at the hospital when she delivered and I wasn't at all surprised to see Amos and his wife there also. Not knowing we had already met Amos introduced me to Becky. She smiled and said how excited she was and that she couldn't wait to hold the baby. Then she got a worried look on her face and asked: 

 "You haven't changed your mind have you? I mean now that you have seen your son?" 

 I assured her that I hadn't and since Amos was looking the other way I winked at her and she gave me a half smile and winked back at me. I mouthed "Everything all right?" and she nodded a yes and then I excused myself to go and take care of the paperwork. Once I had signed everything and had made sure all the information on the birth certificate was correct I split. Five days later I met with Allison, Amos, and Becky at an attorney's office and signed a ton of paperwork and it was done. 

 At least a dozen times during her pregnancy Allison had called me and tried to get me to sit down with her and discuss trying to work things out so we could stay together and I always said no. She followed me out into the hallway as I left the attorney's office and made another attempt to talk with me. I didn't want to and I knew it would be a waste of time, but as long as her parents lived next to mine Allison was going to touch on my life in some way or manner and there would always be the constant pushing and prying of the parents. I decided to give her the sit-down she wanted and let her know for certain sure that there was no way in hell that we would ever be getting back together. 

 There was a Starbucks on the ground floor of the building where the attorney had his offices and we got coffees, found a table and took a seat. I sat there, looked at her and waited. She took a sip of her coffee and then looked at my face and what she saw there told her everything she needed to know. The look told her that her quest was hopeless. She started crying, set down her coffee and got up and ran out of the place. 

 I watched her go and when she was gone I took out my cell phone, checked the contact list for the number I wanted and made the call. I told the attorney to serve the divorce papers that he had been sitting on for almost a year. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That evening I told Vangie that I had finally filed and that if Allison didn't fight it I would be single in six months. Allison had promised as part of the deal that kept us married until the baby was born that she wouldn't contest the divorce, but I had a certain amount of distrust where she was concerned. She might have meant it when she said it, but there had been nine months go by; nine months where both moms would have been working on her. 

 When I gave Vangie the news she said, "That means that you and Sarah might just be able to squeeze in a June wedding." 

 "Are you back on that again?" 

 "I already told you that she was going to take a shot at you. As soon as she hears that you are getting a divorce she will definitely come after you." 

 "And just how is she going to find that out? You can't tell her because that would let her know that we are still in touch." 

 "You say that Russ sometimes joins you in the break room. Next time he does and asks you how thinks are going tell him not so good and then tell him about your breakup and divorce. He will tell Sarah. Then Russ and I will tell her she needs to get out of the house and socialize some and try to get her to come to the company Christmas party with us. Knowing that you will be there I'm betting that she will jump at the chance. Just don't bring a date." 

 "You really think she will do that?" 

 "I just said that I'd bet on it." 

 "You do realize that my hooking up with Sarah will crimp our style." 

 "Why would it?" 

 "She is going to want to spend time with me. How do I tell her that I can't see her on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday?" 

 "You won't have to. Don't forget those are the nights she spends with Russ, John or Larry or (giggle) all three. She will be the one telling you that she has things to do on those nights." 

 "Got it all figured out have you?" 

 "I try." 

 "Okay, but to make it work you will need to get me some information." 

 "What do you need?" 

 I told her. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was like Vangie wrote a script and then gave each of us a copy to follow. Russ joined me for lunch on Friday and asked me how things were going. I told him things were great on the job, but my personal life sucked. He asked what was wrong and I told him about divorcing Allison. By the time lunch period was over he had heard the entire sad story. I called Vangie and told her about the lunch. That night she told Russ she had some things to do on Saturday and would be gone most of the day knowing full well that Russ and Sarah would take full advantage of her being gone. She came over and spent most of the day with me. 

 Monday Vangie pushed a tape into my VCR and I listened to Russ tell Sarah about what I'd told him and then to them making plans to try and convince Vangie that Sarah was going nuts sitting around the house after work and it might be good for her to get out and socialize so how about taking her to the company Christmas party with them? 

 I say I "listened" because Vangie only played those parts of the tapes for me that were conversations. Although I did see Russ and Sarah fondling each other while they talked I never did see them in action and that was fine with me. 

 The company party was on Friday and Thursday Vangie told me about the show of reluctance Sarah put on while Vangie and Russ tried to convince her to go to the party with them. 

 "The little bitch finally caved in and agreed to come with us. It was all I could do to keep from laughing. Later she got me off to the side and told me that she thought it would be too awkward with me being there and her knowing about me and you. I told her not to be silly and reminded her that I had already given you my stamp of approval. When she kept going back to it being awkward I told her that you had danced with me since her break up with you and that there had been no hard feelings between us, except this one" she said as she held my hard cock in her hand. Play your cards right lover and you will get laid tomorrow night." 

 "Oh? You coming home with me? Won't Russ wonder what's up?" 

 "Smart ass. Come on baby; fuck mommy again." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The Backman's were there when I arrived and I waved at them as I made my way over to sit with the people from my shop. When the band started I danced with the wives and girlfriends of the guys at our table and then I walked over to where the Backman's were sitting. I saw Sarah get ready to get up as I approached. She just knew I was going to ask her to dance and I loved the look on her face when I asked Russ if he would mind if I danced with his lovely wife. On the floor Vangie said: 

 "That was mean." 

 "You are the one who told me that she was going to come after me. I intend to make her work for it. I ain't gonna be no pushover. I'll remind her that she kicked me to the curb. We will see just how serious she is about latching onto me." 

 "I know it's coming, but I'm not at all happy that you are going to do her on our bed." 

 "I won't. If it goes anywhere I'll take her to a motel. I'll flat out tell her that I don't want her to know where I live and then I guess we will see how things go from there." 

 The tune ended and I walked Vangie back to her table and as we neared it I could see the expression on Sarah's face. It was saying, "Will he ask me next?" I held Vangie's seat for her as she sat down and then I turned and went back to my table. 

 I danced some more with the wives and girlfriends and about an hour and a half after the music started I had to take a break and go to the bathroom. When I came out I found Sarah standing there in the hall waiting for me. 

 "You haven't asked me to dance." 

 "Why would I? I seem to remember that the last time I saw you I was more or less told to fuck off and die." 

 "I was pissed; could you blame me?" 

 "Of course I can. You were being a two-faced hypocrite." 

 She hadn't expected that and her brow furrowed in confusion, but before she could say anything I went on: 

 "You never asked me why I had a fling with your mother. If you would have I would have said, "Why not? Why shouldn't I have a hot time with a sexy woman while you were fucking a guy named Larry Melrose and pulling trains at the Phi Delta house? After all, what's good for the goose is good for the gander, right?"  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 06 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Her face paled and she said, "I don't know what you are talking about." 

 What I said next I made up on the spot, but she wouldn't know it. 

 "Get off of it Sarah. Did you honestly think you could do gangbangs at a frat house where guys I knew were members? Harry Goddard told me about it and when I called him a liar he showed me the pictures of you that he took with his cell phone. One of them was a nice clear shot of you with a cock in your left hand while my engagement ring sparkled in the light. I figured that if that was how faithful you were to me I could take your mother up on the pass she made at me." 

 She looked down at the floor and using the information Vangie had given me I went on. 

 "I found out about Larry by accident. A guy in one of my classes needed a ride home and I got him to his place on Lewis Court just in time to see you and Melrose pull up, kiss and get out get out of your car. I watched you walk hand in hand into his place. Gary, the guy I gave the ride to, told me that he had seen you there a lot and that sometimes there was another guy there also. I was curious since I'd already found out about your frat house trains so I stuck around and waited for you to come out. I waited three hours and when you came out you had that "well fucked look" that I remembered from the times you were with me. So yes Sarah, of course I blamed you for being pissed at me. Anything else?" 

 She looked up from the floor at me and asked, "Dance with me?" 

 I gave her a long look and then offered her my arm. As we danced she said, "I admit it. There was a period where I was a bit of a slut, but even though I wasn't true to you I did love you. I guess I was sowing my wild oats before I got married and had to settle down. I would have you know. Settled down I mean. I probably wouldn't have gotten pissed at you if it had been anyone but my mother. Anyone else and I would have chalked it up to you doing some wild oat sowing of your own. 

 "But my mother? I just lost it and I stayed pissed for a while and then I woke up to the fact that I'd let the man I really wanted get away. By the time I woke up to that you were already with someone else. I kept waiting for you to break up with her so I could try to get you back, but you never did. I've never gotten you out of my system Frank. I hear through the grapevine that you are getting divorced. Any truth to that?" 

 "I'm afraid so." 

 "Maybe we could try again?" 

 "You, me, Larry and the frat boys?" 

 "Larry's been history for years" she lied, "and I haven't been to a fraternity house since I broke up with you." 

 Another lie, but I hadn't expected any less. The frat house parties were a thing of the past, but they did go on for quite a while after she broke up with me and according to Vangie Sarah had been with Larry and John the previous Wednesday. I knew if I hooked back up with Sarah that she would come with Russ, John and Larry, but I could live with that because I would be bringing along Vangie. 

 On the plus side Sara was almost as good as her mother and I had cared for her enough at one time that I had put a ring on her finger. She would be coming into any relationship we entered into as a cheating slut and with the intention of staying one, but at least I'd know it going in and not have it come as a surprise like it had with Gloria and Allison. And I always would have to keep in mind that I was no better. 

 The music had stopped when she'd said, "Maybe we could try again" and she had turned to go back to her table, but I held her arm until the next number started and as we moved into the next song I said: 

 "Are you really serious about trying again?" 

 "I am and if you get me out of here right now I'll prove it." 

 "I can't leave my group until the party is over, but if you still mean it by then I'll give you the chance." 

 "I mean it and as of right now I am your date for the evening so I'll join you at your table." She paused "Unless you don't want me there." 

 "Why wouldn't I want one of the two best looking women here tonight at my table?" 

 "Best two?" 

 "Can't forget your mom Sarah; I don't think either of us wants to forget your mom." 

 She gave me a look, but she understood what I'd just said. As far as she knew it was her cheating that put her mother into my bed once before and if she wasn't careful??? 

 We walked back to her table and she got her purse and she told her parents that I would see to it that she got home. Russ and Vangie smiled, but each for far different reasons I'm sure. 

 Sarah joined me at my table and I introduced her to those who didn't already know her. She danced with one or two of the guys, but mostly with me and when the party broke up we left together. Once in my truck Sarah said: 

 "You aren't going to take me home I hope." 

 "Are you sure you know what you are doing?" 

 She slid over next to me and her hands went to my belt and zipper as she said: 

 "I'll show you that I know what I'm doing." 

 There was no way she was going to get me off quickly; not after the night I'd had with her mother only twenty-four hours before, but she gave it a good try. When I pulled in at the Super 8 motel she said: 

 "We aren't going to your place?" 

 "Not this time. I'm still a little gun shy after the last time and I'm not ready for you to know where I live until I know where this is going." 

 She gave me a dirty look, but when I came back with a room key she followed me into the room. She was so much like her mother that it was scary. She damned near destroyed me. When I walked her to her front door three hours later she asked: 

 "Will I see you tomorrow?" 

 "Around four?" 

 "It's a date." 

 Saturday was dinner, dancing and a bed at the motel. Sunday was an afternoon movie, dinner and a motel. Sunday night when I took Sarah home I tested Vangie's theory and found that she was right gain. 

 "What time should I pick you up tomorrow?" 

 "Oh I'm sorry baby, but I'm going to have to work late tomorrow." 

 "I've got something going Tuesday so how about Wednesday?" 

 "My bridge night with the girls from my sorority at school." 

 "Maybe I can get out of what I was going to do Tuesday and if I can should I give you a call?" 

 "Please. I'll cross my fingers." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday night I told Vangie that I was going to have to get an apartment after all. 

 "I can't let Sarah know about this place and renting motel rooms for six months will cost me a ton." 

 "You have the money out of your house so find a condo." 

 "I don't dare. I don't trust Allison. I get a condo before the divorce is final and she could try to claim it as community property." 

 "You would be buying it after separating from her." 

 "But with money from the sale of our house which she could also claim as a joint asset. Besides, I'm not supposed to have that money. I've set it up so it looks like I gambled it all away." 

 "Okay then. I'll buy the condo and you can buy it from me after the divorce is final. That way it will look like you are just renting the place." 

 I looked at her stunned. 

 "Don't look at me like that. I told you I have oodles and oodles of money and I can use it however I want. Besides, I'll only be putting up the down payment and you will be paying me back when you buy it from me after your divorce is final. Now come on. You have time to do mommy once more before she has to go home." 

 Tuesday I called Sarah and told her that I couldn't get out of what I'd told her I had to do. Let her sit on pins and needles wondering if I would call her Thursday or Friday. 

 Wednesday Vangie told me not to make any plans for during the day on Saturday because "We are going condo shopping." 

 I didn't call Sarah and ask her out for Thursday because I knew it would be awkward for her to have to say no to me for the third time in a week, but I did set something up with her for Friday. 

 Saturday Vangie showed up at seven in the morning and caught me in my bathroom. "Oh goodie" she said, "I was afraid we would have to waste time undressing you." She took my hand and led me toward the bedroom as she was saying: 

 "Mommy wants her butt fucked lover. Do a good job and I'll have a surprise for you." 

 The "Oh yes, oh God yes, fuck my ass baby, fuck mommy's ass" that rang through the room seemed to indicate, at least to me, that I was doing a good job. After a quick shower – not together or we would have never gotten out of the apartment – I fixed us some breakfast and after we ate we set out to look at condos. 

 Vangie had apparently done some 'pre-shopping' as she had a list of four places that she wanted us to look at. We took her Porsche, but our first stop wasn't a condo, but a Chevy dealer. 

 "What are we here for?" 

 "I told you if you did a good job on my butt I'd have a surprise for you. Wait here" she said as she got out of the car. Five minutes later she came back and drove us over to the other side of the lot and stopped. 

 "Come on" she said as she got out of the car. She came around to my side and took me by the hand and walked me over to a new black Chevy Silverado extended cab four wheel drive pick up. She handed me a set of keys and said: 

 "Merry Christmas lover." 

 "You have got to be shitting me!" 

 "Not at all. I can't stand my lover driving around in a ratty old truck. Besides, I want my daughter to be able to ride around in comfort." 

 "This is way too much Vangie." 

 "No it isn't lover. When I kick the bucket you and Sarah are going to inherit so why not enjoy some of the money now. Take the keys, drive over to the office and sign your name where the man tells you and then we can go looking for a condo." 

 We looked at the four units on Vangie's list and both of us liked the third one we'd looked at the best. Vangie spent a half hour with the agent and when all was said and done Vangie had agreed to buy the four bedroom condo. Why four bedrooms? I wanted one to use as a den and home office and I though Sarah also might like to have a room of her own and then there would be one for company. As we drove back to the Chevy dealer to pick up Vangie's car she told me she would get the keys on Wednesday and I could move in any time after that. 

 At the time I wondered about the quick occupancy, but I later found out that Vangie didn't put down a down payment. She wrote out a check for the full price that she had dickered the agent down to. It would be weeks before the paperwork would all be finished, but it was a done deal and as long as Vangie's check cleared the bank she could have the keys. 

 At the Chevy dealer's lot she gave me a hot kiss, told me that she wished she didn't have to go home and then got in her car and drove off. I drove home, changed and then got into my shiny new Chevy to go and pick up Sarah for our date. 

 When I picked up Sarah she commented on the truck and I told her that since we were beginning anew I felt she deserved to ride in a new vehicle. 

 "Oh how sweet Frankie. I think I'll keep you." 

 It wasn't all that hard of a night on me. Sarah had just started her 'monthly' and I had to settle for a couple of blow jobs in my brand new truck. They were great, but I couldn't help but think that Vangie should have been the first one to have sex with me in the truck she had bought for me. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday night after wearing me out Vangie asked me if I could take a vacation day or a sick day on Wednesday and I told her I had plenty of vacation time coming so it shouldn't be a problem. Wednesday at nine Vangie showed up and found me naked and waiting for her. She laughed and said: 

 "Down boy. Later. Right now we have important things to do." 

 Now that got my attention. It was the first time ever that Vangie had shown up and not wanted to go straight to sex. I dressed and we drove over to the condo. She handed me the key and I opened the door and then stopped dead. When we had looked at the place on Saturday the place had been empty. Now it was furnished. 

 "Come on" Vangie said as she closed the door behind her. "We need to break in the bed." 

 The new king sized bed held up under the workout that took place on it and when it was over Vangie said: 

 "I have to be home by four so we have until then to get started on me marking the territory. We have to make love in every room in the place and on every piece of furniture that will hold us up and on all the floors. At four I have to run home and fix dinner for Russ, but I'll be back around six and we will work on it some more and then there will also be tomorrow night. Anything we don't get to by the time I leave tomorrow we will get to next week. Sarah doesn't get to walk in that door until I have claimed the place because once she starts visiting I won't be able to come back except as an invited guest. I'll keep the apartment as our love nest." 

 "Why? Why have you done all of this?" 

 "Truth time?" 

 "Truth time." 

 "I've done it because you love me." 

 I started to say something, but she held up a hand to stop me. 

 "I came to you to do to you what I did to all of Sarah's other boyfriends, but you turned out to be different. To the rest of them all I was was another piece of ass; a damned good piece of ass, but a piece of ass just the same. I am more than that to you and it shines through and I am more than just a little fond of you, but I love my husband so what you want can never be. I can't return the love you show me, but I glory in your love and I need to show you how much it means to me so I am giving you things. Not things to buy you with, but things that you will always associate with me. Things I have shared with you. Whenever you go somewhere in your truck you will remember that I was the first one to sit in it with you and the first one to kiss you at a stop light. 

 "Whether you are on this bed alone or with someone you will remember sharing it with me. The same goes for every piece of furniture and room in this condo. You will have shared them with me. I know it doesn't come anywhere close to the love you show me, but it is at least something I can give to you. Probably doesn't make much sense to you but it does to me. I'm giving you as much of me as I can. So. Let's do the living room couch next and then maybe the dinning room table." 

 We managed the couch, the dinning room table and the shower before she had to leave and when she came back at six-fifteen we christened the washer and dryer and the bed in one of the spare bedrooms. As she dressed to leave she said: 

 "At this rate it is going to take us two weeks to get to everything. That gives you two weeks to give this place a lived in look before you bring Sarah here." 

 Actually it took three. By the time I brought Sarah to it for the first time I had it looking like I'd lived there for six months. Within a month of her first visit Sarah was living there part time. She usually had to work late a couple of times a week – usually Monday and Thursday and Wednesday night was her card night with her sorority sisters. I of course knew where she really was on those nights and on those nights she usually went home to stay with her parents. I was betting that she did that so I wouldn't be able to tell that I wasn't the first that night if she came to my place and I wanted to make love. 

 Me being me I did try to throw her off her stride one Friday night. I asked her why she always had to work late on Monday and Thursday. How come she never had to work late on any of the other nights of the week. She told me that Monday was a zoo because of everything that had gone on from noon Friday until the end of business Sunday had to be dealt with. Thursday was because payroll had to be done so checks could be issued on Friday and they also had to get everything set up and out to the stores that would be needed for the weekend. I wondered if she came up with that on her own or if it was Russ's brainchild. 

 Vangie still taped things and randomly put a private detective on Sarah so I knew that John and Larry were still tapping Sarah and I began to use the detective's information to build a file against the day I might need it. Vangie and I also had long talks about what to do if Sarah ever found out that Vangie and I were still lovers. I would come unglued on her for lying to me about dropping Larry and if push came to shove I might even throw John under the bus, but under no circumstances could I let it be known that I knew about Russ. 

 To cover myself on how I knew what I knew about John and Larry I would tell her that I was suspicious of her late nights and I had put an investigator on her and then use the details from the reports that Vangie got from her investigator. I'd need to be careful and only use reports that covered Larry and, if necessary, John. I couldn't use any report that included Russ. Fortunately there were times that Sarah only saw John or Larry and a couple of times she saw John and Larry together. My defense would be, "You are fucking others and so I decided that I could too and we both know I have a history with your mom." 

 Russ would never come into it unless the worst case scenario took place. That would be Sarah telling Russ that Vangie and I were lovers. If that happened things would get very, very nasty and messy. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The months went by and Allison kept her word and didn't fight the divorce. I still caught a ration of shit about how I was overreacting and not being fair every time I went over to see my folks and once Mrs. Ames caught me alone and begged me, actually begged me, to give Allison another chance. I almost – only almost – felt like an asshole when I told her it just wouldn't be happening. 

 Fortunately for my health Sarah didn't want to make love every night she spent at my place. No way in hell I could handle three night a week with Vangie and four nights a week with Sarah. Sarah never said no if I wanted to make love and she was the aggressor more often than not. She was getting her fill on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday the same as I was. In truth I didn't do Vangie three nights a week either. There were nights when she couldn't come by and she was still young enough to get visits from her 'Aunt Flo' and of course the same could be said of Sarah. 

 Suddenly June was upon us and it was fish or cut bait time. The divorce would be final on June 14th and Vangie casually mentioned once or twice that it looked like Sarah and I could squeeze in a June wedding. Then one Wednesday night she cut to the chase. 

 "Are you going to marry Sarah?" 

 "I don't know babe. Everything is going so smoothly now and I'm asking myself why do something that might change it." 

 "Why would you think that things might change? As long as Sarah keeps on doing what she is doing she won't be interfering with us. Besides, as long as my tape system keeps on working we will always know what is being planned. They will keep thinking that Russ and John are keeping track of you at work; that John watches you when Russ slips off to meet with Sarah and Russ keeps an eye on you when it is John's turn. Both of them watching you if she is with Larry. 

 "And there is something else. You like being married. It showed through when we were getting together even though you were married to Allison. You loved being married until things went to hell on you. You need a wife to be complete and deep down inside you know it. There are other girls out there and I am certain that you can find one, but you won't find one that is as good a fit for you as Sarah." 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "Because you want me. We both know it, but we also both know that it can never happen. Sarah is almost a carbon copy of me. Granted, she is a cock hungry slut, but so what? I am too. She needs more than you can give her and that is no slam on you. You know damned well that she gives you more than you can handle so what if she has to pick up a little extra to hold her. It is the same with me. Russ never says no to me, but even though I love the man I still need a little extra to keep me satisfied. Then there is the fact that you know what she is and it hasn't bothered you a bit."  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 06 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She paused as she thought about something and then she said: 

 "But there is one more reason why I want you to do it. Actually there are a couple more. The first is that she needs a husband like you and we do know from the tapes that she does love you and that by itself should count for something. Another thing is something that I really don't want to talk about, but it is something that has to be said. I'm twice as old as you are lover and I'm not going to be around forever, but for as long as I'm here I want you to be around. The best way to see that you are is to have you as a son-in-law. The last reason is that when I go I want to go knowing that my baby is going to be taken care of and I know that you will do that. Think about it lover, but do your thinking later. Right now mommy wants your cock." 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I did think about what she'd said. She was right; I had liked being married. I'd liked it when I was with Gloria and I'd liked it when I had been with Allison. I did have feelings for Sarah, but was the feeling love? Given my track record I couldn't really say one way or another. The question was "Did it really matter?" I wasn't at all sure that I had 'loved' Gloria or Allison but until both marriages went 'boom' I was happy being with them. 

 Unlike with Gloria and Allison I would know exactly what I was walking into with Sarah and Vangie was right when she said that I had shown I could handle what Sarah was doing. And in a way wasn't that a good thing? If Sarah didn't have her three lovers and I had to take up the slack wouldn't I go to an early grave? I know that it sounds silly when put that way given all that I was getting from Vangie. With me and her three lovers Sarah was getting laid seven days a week and with Sarah and Vangie I was getting laid seven days a week. You would think that with Vangie and Sarah's lovers out of the picture it would still be seven days a week for me and I'd handled it so far, right? 

 Not so! I was managing because Vangie brought out the very best in me. She had that certain something that made me always rise to the occasion; that certain something that made my blood boil and flow into my cock even if I was only talking to her on the phone. 

 I could spend days thinking about it, but the bottom line was that Vangie wanted me to do it and I could never say no to Vangie. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I told Sarah that she needed to skip her Wednesday evening card game because there was something important that we had to do. She told me that she couldn't cancel because they depended on her. I shrugged and said: 

 "Okay Sarah; if card playing is more important to you than I am just go ahead and play cards." 

 The tone I used when I said that registered on her and she quickly backed up. 

 "Of course card playing isn't more important to me than you are. I'll call them and tell them I can't make it." 

 Wednesday evening I had dinner ready when she got there and a bottle of chilled Merlot sitting on the table. We ate dinner and sipped the wine and after we had finished eating we went into the living room and sat down on the couch I took her left hand in mine and slid a ring on to her ring finger and asked: 

 "Will you accept this Sarah?" 

 She held up her hand and looked at it. "Oh God Frankie; of course I will" and she threw herself at me and cried into my shoulder. After a while the tears stopped and she said, "I hoped, but I never really expected. Oh shit!" and then she was crying again. Tears of joy she told me later. 

 In the morning over breakfast she held up her hand and looked at it and said: 

 "It is a perfect fit Frank." 

 "It should be. You've worn it before." 

 "You kept it? All these years and you've kept it?" 

 "Maybe something told me that some day I would need it again." She burst into tears again, got up from her chair, came over and dropped into my lap. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The wedding was held on the last Friday in June at City Hall with Russ and Vangie as witnesses. The reception was held in Russ and Vangie's backyard on Saturday and on Sunday we flew to Cabo san Lucas for a two week honeymoon. I don't know how John and Larry handled the two weeks Sarah was gone, but I would bet that Vangie stayed busy trying to fuck Russ's eyes out. 

 We had moved all of Sarah's things into the condo before the wedding, but most of it had never been unpacked so we spent the day after getting back from Cabo getting Sarah situated and then we embarked on our married life. 

 Some things didn't change. And that came as no surprise. Sarah went back to work and back to working late on Mondays and Thursdays and playing cards on Wednesdays and of course Vangie and I made use of our love nest on those three days. 

 I am incapable of just ignoring things so every once in a while I had to throw some shit into the game. I had decided that I need to keep track of Sarah and I knew I couldn't always depend on Vangie's set up to catch everything that Sarah might be up to so before the wedding I had the condo wired with the same system that Vangie had in her house. 

 Three days after returning from our honeymoon I reviewed the previous day's tapes and learned something that I hadn't know before. If Vangie had mentioned it I either didn't pick up on it or didn't hear her say it. Of course I never thought to ask either. All I knew was that Russ, John and Larry were Sarah's lovers and I knew that John and Larry were good friends of Russ's. The tape I was watching had happened the previous day at twelve forty-five and it explained a lot. It explained why John and/or Russ had to keep an eye on me at work and it explained why Sarah, even though she had planned to be a teacher when she graduated, had taken a job at Arman Enterprises. 

 As I watched the tape Sarah and Larry came in the front door and walked into the living room. They went into a clinch, kissed and then Larry sat down on the couch while Sarah stripped for him. Once naked she went to her knees, unzipped him and took out his cock. It quickly became apparent why Sarah was seeing him. He was big! He wasn't any bigger around than me – in fact I might have even had an inch on him there – but he was long. His ten and a half inches dwarfed my six and three quarters. 

 Sarah took him in her mouth and worked on him while he loosened his tie and unbuttoned his shirt. He took off his shirt and tie and she let go of his cock and he stood up and undressed. As he stepped out of his pants he said: 

 "Which way to the bedroom?" 

 "We won't be using a bedroom this time." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because the bedrooms have beds that are my husbands." 

 "Oh come on Sarah." 

 "No Larry. We will not do it on the bed I share with my husband and we won't do it on the beds in the spare bedrooms until I can buy sheets of my own. I won't fuck you on sheets my husband bought." 

 "Nonsense Sarah. Using that logic we can't even do it here because everything here was bought by your husband." 

 "You want this body Larry?" she said as she stood in front of him and cupped her tits in her hands. Larry's face gave her the answer and she said, "Then we will do things my way, understand?" 

 She got down on the couch and spread her legs and Larry wasted no time in getting between them. He fucked her once missionary and then after she got him up again he did her doggie. As they were dressing Sarah said: 

 "Now that I'm married we need to do something about my pay." 

 "Do what?" 

 "Sooner or later Frank is going to see one of my paychecks or paycheck stubs. He isn't stupid so he just might notice that I'm not being paid overtime for all those nights I tell him I'm working late." 

 "That's easy enough to fix. I'll just change you from hourly to salary and kick it up five hundred a month to make it look better." 

 "Thank you. Next time I'll have one of the spare bedrooms ready." 

 "Still doesn't make sense to me." 

 "Doesn't need to Larry; as long as it makes sense to me." 

 There it was; the missing piece of the puzzle. Larry was her boss so she was able to get away from work during the day and that's why John or Russ needed to keep track of me. 

 So, like I said, every once in a while I feel the need to stir the pot. I kept an eye on Russ and John and one Monday just after lunch I saw John slip away from his office and I guessed he was on his way for some early afternoon fun. I gave him a half hour head start and then I called my lead technician into the office and told him to keep an eye on things while I ran an errand. I was parked up the street from the condo when John hurried out, got in his car and took off. Ten minutes later Sarah came rushing out. I smiled and went back to work. 

 When I reviewed the tape I found out something that I had long suspected. I'd always hard a hard time understanding why Sarah would waste time on old, fat and bald John. I'd once told myself that maybe it was because he had a twelve inch cock. I said it in jest, but it actually did look like it was a foot long on the tape. Like Larry's it was no bigger around than mine, but the fucking thing was huge. I could not believe that it would go all the way inside Sarah, but I was wrong. She took every inch of it. 

 Anyway, I was watching the tape and Sarah's cell phone rang. She had it next to her on the bed and I'm guessing that it was because it would be quickly to hand in cases like this. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Okay. Thanks for the heads up." 

 She was pushing John away as she dropped the phone on the bed. 

 "Frank just left work" she said as she tried to push John off of her. 

 "We have time" John said, "It takes thirty-five minutes to get here from the plant." 

 "Get off me John; I'm not taking any chances. Move it! I need to get dressed and make the bed." 

 "I'm close baby; let me finish." 

 "Get the fuck off of me and get out of here!!!" 

 I told Vangie about it Wednesday night and we got a big laugh out of it. I only did it two more times. Once I interrupted Russ, but the other time John either met Sarah some place else or he had a doctor's appointment or something. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 The week after I returned from the honeymoon I told Vangie that it was time for me to buy the condo from her. 

 "No need. It is your wedding present." 

 "The trip to Cabo was your was your wedding present." 

 "That was the present from Russ and me to you and Sarah. The condo is my wedding present to you." 

 "I can't let you do that Vangie." 

 "How you going to stop me lover? It is a done deal. I transferred ownership to you before you married Sarah so that she could never claim it as community property if things don't work out for the two of you." 

 "Damn it Va..." 

 "Just hush up Frank. By now you should know I'm going to do what I want. Any time you spend arguing with me is time that could be put to better use giving mommy what she wants." 

 As her mouth closed around my cock I gave up trying to reason with her. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Over the next year I learned that Sarah was a bit of a control freak. Maybe that's not the term that best describes her actions; maybe she just like to have things organized in a certain way. Whenever she did John or Larry in the condo she always did them in the front spare bedroom. The rear spare bedroom is where she took care of Russ. John and Larry were never allowed in the back bedroom and Russ, Larry and John were never allowed in the master bedroom, but she did occasionally do Russ in the front spare room. I learned that only Russ (and I) got to tap her ass. Larry and John kept trying to get it, but she told them no, that it only belonged to me. 

 If you overlooked her outside activities (and I did) Sarah was a perfect wife. I had no complaints. Things had pretty much worked out as Vangie had predicted. Sarah had her 'bit on the side' and I had mine and for five years we slid along with no problems and then one Monday came the day that I had always been expecting. 

 

 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** The Next One Ch. 07 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I came home from work to find Sarah sitting at the kitchen table drinking a beer. That alone told me something was up because she was normally a wine drinker. I bent down to kiss her and she jerked her head away and said: 

 "Don't you dare touch me you fucking asshole." 

 I stood up and went to the fridge and got myself a beer and then sat down across from her and said: 

 "And just why am I a fucking asshole?" 

 She picked up a manila envelope from the table in front of her and threw it at me. 

 "Read that!!" she snarled. 

 It was a report from a detective agency and it covered my last two meetings with Vangie. 

 "What have you got to say to that?" 

 I looked at her for a couple of seconds as she stared back at me and then I stood up and said: 

 "Don't go away. I'll be right back." 

 I went to the bedroom that I had made into a home office/den and opened the safe I'd never told Sarah about. It was hidden behind a removable panel inside the closet. I removed two envelopes and went back into the kitchen. I sat down and tossed one of the envelopes to Sarah and said: 

 "I'll see your report" and then I flipped the other envelope to her and said, "and I'll raise you one." 

 One report covered one of her visits to Larry's place and the other covered a visit to John's. 

 "And I have more. Want me to dig them out?" 

 She had opened the first one and her face had gone pale and I knew she was wondering if I had one of her and Russ. I went on. 

 "Remember back to that company Christmas party where we got back together and I made the "two best looking women in the place" comment? Remember your response and then what I said to you? I expected you to get the message, but you apparently missed it. You lied to me then when you said you were done with Larry. Of course I didn't know about John then, but I do now." 

 Then I paused for a moment and then said in a harsh tone of voice, "So where the fuck do you get off getting all belligerent with me?!! At least with your mother I'm keeping it in the family." 

 She was already pale, but when I said "keeping it in the family" she went totally white-faced. 

 "I'm going out for a while and while I'm gone I want you to get your shit out of our bedroom and move into one of the spare bedrooms" and I got up and left. 

 I hadn't even started the car and I had Vangie on her cell phone. I told her what had gone down and she asked me what I was going to do. 

 "It will depend on Sarah. I'm in attack mode so I'll be going after her. I need to find out why she put a PI on me and what she intended to do when she found out whatever she was trying to find out. I've burned Larry and John and I will of course keep Russ out of it, but I'm going to hint at knowing a lot more than what I've hit her with. Right now I have the edge because she didn't expect me to come firing back at her. I will not let her know that I let you know and in fact I will tell her that I have no intention of you ever finding out that she knows." 

 "You going to divorce her?" 

 "That will depend on her. I won't go for one, but if that is what she had in mind when she hired the detective it might end up in a divorce." 

 "What are you going to do right now?" 

 "I'm going down to Riley's Tavern, have a few and let her sit home and stew for a while." 

 "Should we cool it for a bit?" 

 "No. She knows about us so there is no reason to stop. Unless you want to?" 

 "No lover, I don't. See you Wednesday?" 

 "You bet." 

 I had three beers at Riley's and shot a game of eight ball with Billy Holbrook and then headed on home. Sarah was sitting at the kitchen table drinking a beer when I walked in. I got myself a beer and leaned on the kitchen counter. I took a pull on the Bud and then said: 

 "Why in the hell did you put a detective on me?" 

 "I thought you were cheating on me." 

 "What made you think that?" 

 "I smelled perfume on you and one night I saw a trace of lipstick on your neck." 

 I almost laughed at her, but held it in. "Let me see if I understand this. You come home and smell perfume on me, right?" 

 She nodded her head yes. 

 "Since the only nights I spend with your mom are the nights you lie to me and say you are working late or playing cards you are saying that you came home after rolling around on one of your lover's beds getting all sweaty and smelly, ready and willing to give me sloppy seconds if I wanted to make love to you and you smelled perfume on me and got upset? That about sum it up?" 

 She looked away and down at the floor. "And just what were you going to do if you found out that I was doing what you were doing?" 

 She didn't look at me and she didn't answer. "Speak up Sarah. What is going to happen is going to be decided in this kitchen right now. When I leave the room I will have decided what I'm going to do. You want any say in the matter you had better speak up right now. It is the only chance you will get." 

 She looked up at me and said, "I was going to threaten you with divorce if you didn't stop seeing whoever it was you were seeing." 

 "Basically you are saying you would be giving me a second chance, but I would be under your thumb from then on. In other words I was to stay home and behave while you kept on cheating on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. That about right?" 

 She looked away again. I sat there and looked at her without saying anything for almost a minute before I said: 

 "The fact you weren't going straight for a divorce changes what I was thinking." I gave her another minute of silence and then said, "Here is the way it is going to go. You don't have to agree of course, but if you don't we will turn it over to the lawyers. Your mother, next to you, is the hottest, sexiest and most fantastic piece of ass I've ever known (not true of course, in fact it was just the opposite, but I wasn't going to say that). I am not going to stop seeing her as long as she is willing to see me. Since I will continue to see your mother I will let you continue with one of your lovers. One Sarah. You chose which one and since I don't trust you I will periodically put a private detective on you just to check up on you to make sure that it is just one. 

 "You will not tell your lovers that I know about them and I will not tell your mother that you know about us. One other thing. I am not stupid and I'm well aware that you may have more lovers than just John and Larry and my investigators just might not have been on duty when you met those lovers. I haven't had you watched in over a year, but starting now, if you accept my terms, you are going to be watched a lot more often. One lover Sarah; only one. I don't care who you chose, but only one. Have I made myself clear?" 

 "And if I don't agree?" 

 "Then the lawyers get involved and things get very messy and nasty. Think on it and let me know by tomorrow morning." 

 I got up and went into the living room and turned on the TV. About twenty minutes later Sarah came into the room and sat down on the couch next to me. 

 "Can we negotiate?" 

 "On what?" 

 "On the one lover issue." 

 "No." 

 "You haven't heard my proposal. You just may be okay with it." 

 "Okay; what do you want?" 

 "To keep them both, but only one at a time. One for three months and then the other for three and keep on rotating them." 

 "You love them that much that you can't bear to give one of them up?" 

 "I don't love either of them, but they both have something that I want." 

 "And what would that be?" 

 "Big cocks." 

 "Oh goody; my ego really needed that shot. I always thought I did a pretty good job for you." 

 "You do an excellent job of making love to me, but what they have and you don't is a few more inches. They touch places inside me that you just can't reach. I love the feeling that those extra inches give me." 

 I looked at her for several seconds and then said, "Six months. You can change every six months." 

 Her face clouded up a bit and she got up and left the room. 

 Sarah stayed out of my way for the rest of the evening and around nine-thirty I went to bed. I hadn't been in bed five minutes when Sarah came into the room and got into bed with me. She was naked. 

 "I thought I told you to take one of the spare bedrooms." 

 "Fuck you Frank. I saw the dates on those reports you gave me. You have known what has been going on for years and you never made a move to stop me or kick me out. If I hadn't gotten stupid things would have gone on for years with no change. I love you and I belong in this bed with you. You told me how it was going to be as far as you were concerned and now I'm going to tell you how it is going to be as far as I am concerned. 

 "I'm keeping my lovers and my Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. I will continue trying to fuck you to death and if I do a good enough job I won't leave you enough to give my mother any. If you can still handle her after I get done with you I'll live with it. I will give this. Get on the Net and pull up some of those adult sites and see if you can find one that sells those things that they say can make your dick bigger. If you can find one and it works I promise I'll drop my lovers the day you reach ten inches. Am I clear on this?" 

 While she was saying all that she had been stroking my cock until it was hard and then she swung over me and guided me up into her. I knew I wasn't going to give her up, but I also knew that I couldn't let this become one of those "yes dear" moments that Russ had once told me about so I said: 

 "Are you willing to gamble?" 

 "On what?" 

 "It is only fair that if you have more than one lover I should also have more than one. The thing is I don't want to have to go through all that game playing seduction nonsense. My mom keeps telling me that Allison still wants me and would get back with me in a heart beat. Of course she would try and win me back so do you feel like gambling?" 

 She laughed and drove herself down on me. "The only woman alive who could steal you from me is my mother and as long as my dad stays alive that ain't never going to happen. You feel the need to keep the numbers even? Have at it! Between my mother and me you won't have enough left to do anybody else any good. Face it Frank. You belong to me and I'm keeping you. Now fuck me Frank; fuck your slut." 

 Shit!! She never even gave me a chance to say "Yes dear." Report_Story
