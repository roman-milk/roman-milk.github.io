 ****** Cheat and Lie ****** byGotBaconÂ© "Dad, am I adopted?" 

 "Holy cow, Jim. What made you ask that. I was in the delivery room when you were born. They let me watch. You looked like a little potato with arms and legs. It was one of the best experiences of my life. It's an amazing thing to watch new life coming into the world. In fact, I watched all of you kids being born. I was busting my shirt buttons watching that. You're Mom had a tough time with you. You were really big and she had a hysterectomy after you were born." 

 "Well, I was thinking back about something that came up in biology class last semester. It was about the genetics of eye color. He said if the parents had blue eyes they couldn't have a brown eyed baby. I told them you and Mom had blue eyes and mine were brown. He said I was probably adopted unless there was a brown eye gene in the family. Gary and Sarah have brown eyes too." 

 "Well, I know for a fact you weren't adopted." 

 Then it hit me. Maybe I wasn't his father. My mouth fell open but my mind went into denial. No way she would cheat on me. She loves me, she's a wonderful mother, she's a loving wife. Our sex life is great. She is always receptive to my advances. She wants it as much as I do. Many a night I was wondering if she was going to wake up the neighbors with her wild orgasms. I never saw any suspicious things that would even hint at her being a cheater. It just couldn't happen. I shook it off figuring something had to be wrong with all of this. 

 "Let's see what the internet says about that." 

 "Dad, the internet is full of bad information." 

 "I know, but let's see what we can find. There has to be an explanation." 

 I cranked up my search engine and did some eye color searches. 

 "There, see that. It's about recessive genes. Brown eye genes are dominant. If your Grandmas and Grandpas had brown eyes you could too." 

 "What color are their eyes. Dad.?" 

 I opened the family pictures folder. I found one of Amy's Mom and Dad taken at our wedding. I zoomed in and saw two pair of blue eyes. A little ball of ice was forming in my gut. I knew my parents had blue eyes too. We only had black and white pictures of both of our grandparents so I wasn't sure about them. 

 "Dad, are you thinking what I'm thinking?" 

 "Let's not jump to conclusions. There had to be some explanation. You're Mom would never do that. I have a friend that works at a police lab. He does all kinds of genetic testing for court. Let me see what he says. And don't say a thing to anyone about this. I don't want to falsely accuse your Mom of anything." 

 "OK, Dad. I'll wait till you find out." 

 ******************* 

 "Hi, John. This is Eric. How have you been?' 

 "Hey, Eric. Long time no see. I'm good. How about you?" 

 "I'm doing OK. I need to pick you brain. Can we meet for lunch." 

 "Sure, I can get away. We're actually having a slow day. How about the Olive Garden on 5th and Main. Say, 12:30." 

 "Perfect. I'll see you there." 

 "Bye." 

 ********************** 

 "Hi, John. Good to see you again." 

 "Good to see you too. What's this all about?" 

 "Well. Jim had something come up in his biology class. They were talking about genetics and eye color. He asked me about it. I couldn't find much on the internet so I thought of you. The question is, can blue eyed parents have brown eyed kids." 

 He thinks a minute. 

 "Why do I suspect this is more than a question about biology. Is this about your kids." 

 "OK, I'll level with you. My parents and Amy's parents have blue eyes. Amy and I have blue eyes. My kids all have brown eyes. Are they mine?" 

 He thinks a minute. 

 "You put me in a bad spot. How do you want it, sugar coated or straight out." 

 The ice berg in my stomach just got bigger. I know the answer. 

 "They aren't mine, right?" 

 "Pretty slim chance. Depends on how far back the recessive brown gene is. The farther back it is the less likely they have brown eyes." 

 It's all I can do to maintain my composure. 

 "Thanks, John. I need to go now." 

 "Eric, take it easy on your self. Please. This is gonna be hard for you. I watched my brother go through this. Don't give up on yourself. It gets easier. How quick it gets easier is up to you." 

 I shake his hand and leave. 

 I pull out of the parking lot trying to stay composed. I realize I shouldn't be driving in my condition. I pull into a shopping center and park. 

 I lay my head on the steering wheel and lose it. My tears fall like rain. My gut is in turmoil. I open the door and toss my lunch. Every horrible thought goes through my mind. How could she do this. How can she be such a loving wife and mother and lay with another man. How could she let me raise another man's children. My ego and my pride is ripped to shreds. My heart has been torn from my chest. I cry for what seems like forever. 

 I lift my head. I need to go somewhere and think. I need to figure out what to do. I head back to my office. As I walk in my secretary Sally, looks at me. Her mouth falls open. After ten years of working for me she knows me like a book. 

 "My god, Eric. What's the matter. You look terrible." 

 I go and sit at my desk. She follows and puts her arm on my shoulder. 

 "What is it, Eric? What's happened?" 

 "It's the worst day of my life. I think Amy cheated on me and her lover is the father of my children." 

 "Oh god, Eric. How terrible. I can't believe she did that. Are you sure?" 

 "Almost certain. I haven't talked to her yet. I'm way to upset to do it now." 

 "You need to talk to her. Maybe it isn't true. Go home now and talk to her." 

 "I don't think I can now. I need time to think." 

 "Please don't do anything rash. I'm sure there is a good explanation." 

 "I hope so, Sally. I really hope so." 

 I leave the office and go to my car. 

 I sit and try to think what I should do. 

 The first thing I want to do is get the kids out of the house before I confront Amy. I call Jim. 

 "HI, Jim. I did some checking around. I'm almost positive it's true. I need you to get your brother and sister out of the house. Go up to the lake house and take the sat phone. Tell Sarah and Gary I want some alone time with your Mom. Get some money from her for groceries. I'm sure she will be ok with the idea. I'll call you when to come back." 

 "Fuck, Dad. This is so fucked up. I can't believe Mom did this." 

 "Me either. Please do as I ask. You can tell Gary and Sarah after you get up there. Don't say anything to your Mom. Call me when you leave." 

 Two hours later my cell phone rings. I see it's Jim. 

 "Hi." 

 "Hi Dad. We're on our way. I already told Gary and Sarah. They are really pissed at Mom." 

 "I'm not one hundred percent sure yet so wait till I call you. I'm going to call your Mom soon. But first I have to find a place to think. Don't start hating on your Mom. Both of us love you guys. Don't forget that." 

 "OK, Dad. We love you too. We'll be waiting for your call." 

 I call my boss and ask for some time off. I explain my situation and he tells me to take all the time I need. I decide to get a hotel room and figure out what I'm going to do. As I'm sitting on the bed all the terrible thoughts start again. I decide to call Amy. I can't put it off any longer. 

 "Hello. Eric." 

 "Hi, Amy. I know the kids aren't mine. I'll call you in a couple days. I need time to think." 

 I hear a gasp and a "No no" as I hit end call. My phone rings immediately. It's Amy. I let it go to voice mail. Five minutes later it rings again. I turn my phone off. My mind starts running again. I turn on the TV for a distraction. It doesn't work. It's just audio wallpaper. After crying and feeling sorry for myself for hours I fall asleep. 

 I wake up the next morning with a start. Then it all comes back. All the bad thoughts hit and the crying starts again. I cry off and on for the next two hours. Suddenly, what John told me come to mind. "It gets easier. How quick it gets easier is up to you." I decide to get the confrontation over with. Putting it off won't make it go away. 

 "Hello, Eric. Please come home. We need to talk. I can explain everything." 

 "Give me an hour and I'll be there. I need to shower first." 

 "OK, baby. Remember, I love you." 

 "Good bye, Amy." 

 ************************** 

 The laundry is going. The dusting is done. The kitchen is clean. The vacuuming is done. It's time for a break. I fix myself a cup of tea and think about what to make for dinner. I decide to go online and look for something new. Jim walks in, gives me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. 

 :Hi, Mom. Dad called me. He wants Sarah, Gary and I to go up to the lake house for a few days. He wants some alone time with you. I think he has plans for you." 

 "Oh my. Alone time, huh? I like that. Did you call Gary and Sarah?" 

 "Yep. They're on their way home. I need some money for food." 

 "I don't know if I have enough cash. Take my ATM card. Go easy on the junk food. You can't live on nachos and donuts." 

 "OK, I'm gonna pack." 

 I hear a uproar as Gary and Sarah come in. 

 "Mom. We're going to the lake house. Dad wants to jump your bones. You guys can run around naked and act like animals." 

 "Sarah! How you talk." 

 "Tell me I'm wrong, Mom." 

 "Go get packed. I gave Jim my ATM card. You'll need some food. I think there is enough propane for a few days. And no parties. I don't want to hear about some wild party and have to bail you out of jail. Maybe a little beer, but take it easy." 

 I kiss them all goodbye and watch them drive away. This is going to be great. I'll fix Eric his favorite dinner and fuck his brains out. My pussy tingles at the thought. After checking that I have everything for dinner I think about what to wear when Eric comes home. I want him to know what I have planned. I start looking through my lingerie drawer and my phone rings. 

 "Hello, Eric." 

 "Hi, Amy. I know the kids aren't mine. I'll call you in a couple days. I need time to think." 

 "No! No! Please, Eric. It's not what you think. Please come home. I'll explain everything." 

 I see that he hung up on me. In panic I call him back. He doesn't answer. My world just came crashing down around me. I'm lost my husband. My family is gone. My kids will hate me. My parents will hate me. I fall to the floor and cry. Despair overwhelms me. I manage to get to my bedroom. I fall on the bed and cry out for help. 

 "Please, God. Help me make this right. I've lost the love of my life and my children." 

 I try to call him again. He won't take my calls. I decide to call his office. 

 "Hello, Eric Jensen's office. How may I help you." 

 "Sally, this is Amy. Is Eric there?" 

 "No, Amy. He left a while ago." 

 "I need to talk to him. Do you know where he went?" 

 "No, he was pretty upset when he left. He said he needed to think." 

 "Thank you, Sally. If he comes in tell him I called." 

 "I will, Amy. I'm sure he will call you soon. Give him a little time." 

 "Goodbye." 

 I clutch my phone in my hand. All I can do is wait for his call. I lay on my bed thinking of all the worst possible things that will happen and cry. 

 ************************** 

 Gary is driving. Sarah is sitting in the front passengers seat crying and sniffling. Jim is in the back seat staring at his feet. Sarah speaks first. 

 "How could Mom do this to Dad. Yes, Dad. He will always be my Dad no matter what. He will be my Dad forever and forever. But how could she choose someone else. I just don't understand. She let him think he was our father all those years." 

 Gary says, "I don't have a clue either, Sarah. I can't figure it. Dad sounded really bad on the phone. He is really hurt by this. I sure hope they can get by this. 

 From the back seat Jim says, "It's all my fault. I started it all. If I hadn't of asked him about being adopted none of this would have happened. I never should have taken that biology class." 

 Sarah says, "Don't do that to yourself, Jim. It's not your fault. Mom caused all of this. Don't play the guilt card on yourself." 

 Gary says, "We need to do something to help. I don't know what, but we have to. They have to know that we love them both and we want the family to stay together. We need to think positive about it." 

 Jim says, "I know Dad's ego and pride are ripped into little pieces. Mom has to be in a lot of pain knowing how Dad feels." 

 Gary says, "We'll get through this. I just know we will." 

 ************************ 

 I wake up the next morning. The first thing I think of is did Eric call. I grab my phone out of the charger and check for missed calls. Nothing. 

 "OK, one foot in front of the other. I need to shower and eat breakfast." 

 I go into the bathroom and lay my phone on the counter. I want it near. I shower, dry off and get dressed. I put my phone in my pocket. Into the kitchen, put on a pot of coffee and put some bread in the toaster. 

 "Please call, Eric. Please. I love you. Let me explain." 

 I eat the toast and drink my coffee, staring at the phone. It doesn't ring. He will call. He has to call. I know I can make it all right if he will just call. 

 

 Two hours later my phone rings. It's Eric. 

 "Hello, Eric. Please come home. We need to talk. I can explain everything." 

 "Give me an hour and I'll be there. I need to shower first." 

 "OK, baby. Remember, I love you." 

 "Good bye, Amy." 

 ********************** 

 I pull up in front of what maybe is my home. Only time would tell. I sat for a minute gathering my thoughts. I walked up to the door and rang the bell. Amy opens the door immediately. 

 "Come in, Eric. You didn't need to ring the doorbell. This is still your home. This is where your family is." 

 She really knows how to sink the hooks into me." 

 "Come in the kitchen. I have a fresh pot of coffee on." 

 She pours two cups of coffee and sits. 

 "OK, Sarah. It's time to talk, I'm all cried out and I don't know what to do." 

 "Let me explain everything. Then we can get busy fixing everything. 

 "OK, I'm listening." 

 "I'll start at the beginning. I met this guy in college. He was brilliant. His IQ was off the scale. He had a uncanny memory. He could remember everything he ever read. There's a name for it but I can't remember what it is. He was interesting to talk to. If you asked him what time it was he would tell you how to build an atomic clock. He had no social skills. We hung out for a while and I tried to teach him how to interact with normal people. I remember thinking how smart he was and how smart his children would turn out. I suspected his kids would change the world. He made a lot of progress with his social skills. Then I met you. I fell head over heels in love with you. I know you remember how we were. I lost touch with him. You took over my whole world. I knew I wanted to marry you after our first date. You swept me off my feet right into your bed. I saw what a wonderful, kind, sweet person you were. I knew I wanted you to be the father of my children. 

 "I see where you're going with this is going, Amy. You fucked him and let me believe they were mine. You kept me around for a meal ticket to feed your brilliant children. Is that it?" 

 "Oh god no, Eric. I wanted the best for my babies. I knew you would be the best father in the world. I didn't think you would ever find out. We would have brilliant babies raised in a wonderful loving family. I never wanted to hurt you. You're the love of my life. I just wanted him as a sperm donor." 

 "That's crazy, Amy. You let me live a lie for all these years. You let me love the kids, knowing they weren't mine. You took another man in your bed and lied about it. How could you live with a lie for so long." 

 "It got easier as time went on. I just pushed it to the back of my mind. I knew you loved me and the kids and they loved you. It was beautiful to see." 

 "So my genes weren't that good. I graduated from college in the top fifteen percent of my class. I graduated from law school in the top ten percent of my class. I passed the bar exam on my first try. I got a job with the most prestigious law firm on the west coast. I have the highest percentage of successful cases in the history of this law firm. I'm up for a full partnership as soon as Johnson retires. I'm really sorry that I didn't measure up to your genetic standards. 

 She starts crying. I feel like taking her in my arms and holding her but the pain and anger stops me. I love this woman but I hate what she did. 

 'Please don't think of it like that. I just wanted the very best for my children. You are the best father anyone could ask for. You guided them through all the pitfalls of growing up. Look how good they turned out. They're wonderful children. They love you and I know you love them. It was your influence that made them that way." 

 "I can understand what you wanted. I want the best for them too. It's the lies that really bother me." 

 "I'm so sorry for that. I never meant to hurt you. I didn't think you would ever find out. I love you too much to do that." 

 "This part I could learn to live with. It won't be easy but I could do it. There's another part we haven't got to." 

 'Oh god, no. Please. I know the cheating part is horrible for you. I don't know how to fix it." 

 "Horrible is a good word for it. You want to know how I feel about it. I have this video that runs in my head. I see you with him in bed. You have your legs open with them locked around his ass. I see him thrusting his cock in you. I see you thrusting up taking his cock in you. I see his ass cheeks clenching as her pumps his cum into you. I see you pushing up, taking all of him in you begging for him to cum in you. I hear you screaming as your orgasm goes though your body. That runs though my mind every time I think of him fathering your children." 

 "Please, Eric. Don't do this. You're torturing yourself. Don't do this to yourself." 

 "Tell me it wasn't that way. Tell me you didn't cum with him. I know how you are. I found out on the third date we had. Do you remember that. I'll never forget how you screamed for me to cum in you." 

 "Please don't do this. Please. She says, sobbing." 

 "I have an ego, Sarah. It's the way men are. We have egos and pride. Tell me, was he bigger than me. Does he have a huge cock. Did his big cock make you cum harder than mine did. How many times did you fuck him. I suspect more than three. Did I get sloppy seconds? Did I get to eat his cream pies?" 

 "Please Eric. This will only hurt you more. I've hurt you enough already. Please." 

 "Tell me or I'll walk out that door and you'll never see me again. I want the truth from you. I'm already hurt. It can't get much worse." 

 "All right. I'll tell you. He is bigger than you. He wasn't a better lover. He would come here for a week. We had sex every day for that week. I faked not feeling well while he was here. Then you and I made love without a condom once I got pregnant. I got pregnant with Gary and Sarah in one try. It took three tries for Jim. He had trouble getting away from his wife. He had to wait till there were seminars so he could leave. He told his wife they were for two weeks when they were only for a few days. I did have orgasms with him. I couldn't help that. You know how I am." 

 "Are you still in contact with him?" 

 "Yes. But not that much. He sends emails now and then asking how they are. He sends birthday and Christmas gifts. I just put my name on them." 

 "Does his wife know about this?" 

 "No. He says it would destroy his marriage." 

 "I want to know who he is. He owes me." 

 "Please don't make trouble for him. He has a good marriage going. He has three boys in college." 

 "I won't make trouble for him if he meets with me. I plan on collecting child support from him. How he wants to do it is up to him. If he refuses I'll sue his ass off and his wife will find out. It's up to him. His wife may find out about it anyway. It will be hard to explain the sum I'm going after to her. But that's his problem. He won't get much sympathy from me."  

 

 ****** Cheat and Lie ****** byGotBaconÂ© "Please don't hurt him. He isn't a bad man. It took me a long time to convince him to go with my plan. I think he agreed just so I would stop asking." 

 "Do you have feelings for him? Amy. Are you trying to protect him." 

 "No. I don't. I just don't want anyone else hurt. I've hurt enough people with this. 

 "What's his name, Amy?" 

 "He's Brian Parsons. He lives in Tempe, Arizona. He's a professor of physics at Arizona State." 

 "Here's what I want you to do. Email him and tell him you will never contact him again. He isn't to contact you ever. No gifts. No inquiries about the kid. No more contact. You will break all ties with him." 

 "Do you agree to that?" 

 "Yes, Eric. I'll do anything you ask. I love you. I'll do anything to get us past this." 

 I'll call the kids and tell them to come home. I expect they will have a lot to say to you, so get ready. Especially Sarah. She will vent and then probably do everything she can to get us back together. I know she will give you a piece of her mind. Just remember they love you. You're their mother. They will always love you." 

 "Do you still love me, Eric." 

 "I'll probably love you forever. I really hate what you did. I may be able to deal with me not being their father, but I don't know about forgetting you cheating on me. I'll probably need professional help to get that video our of my head." 

 "I'll go to counseling with you. Anything to get us past this. Please don't give up on us. I know we can make it right. I'm just so sorry that I hurt you. I never wanted that to happen." 

 "I'm going to stay away for a while. I need to be alone to think my way through this. I won't abandon you or the kids. I know I won't be able to get that video out of my head if I'm seeing you everyday. 

 "Whatever you want. I'll agree. Just don't give up on us. Call me from time to time. Let me know how you're doing." 

 "I will. I need to go now. I need to call the kids. Expect them home probably today." 

 I go and pack my clothes and toiletries. As I start to leave my asks. 

 "Can I have a hug before you go. I really need one." 

 I take her in my arms. We hug and then I walk out the door. I hear her break down and start crying as the door closes. 

 *********************** 

 The next morning I call the kids. It's time for them to come home. 

 "Hello, Dad. Are you OK. We're worried sick." 

 "Hi, Sarah. I'm OK. Take it easy. 

 "Did you talk to Mom. What happened." 

 "Calm down. I talked to her. You can all come home now. I'm going to rent an apartment for a while. I need some time to get my mind right. And take it easy on her. She is taking this pretty hard. I know you want to give her a piece of your mind, but go easy." 

 "Are you going to divorce her?" 

 "I haven't decided on anything yet. Just come home and I'll explain everything to you. I'll keep you all in the loop. One thing I want you to know. Now that I know who Mr. Sperm Donor is, if you want to contact him I won't stand in your way. It will be your call. 

 "I've lived this long without talking to him. I can go a lot longer without him." 

 "Maybe when you get older you'll change your mind." 

 "OK, Dad. We'll leave in a couple of hours. 

 "OK, bye bye. I love you." 

 "We love you too, Dad. See you in a while." 

 ************************ 

 The kids come home. They burst in the door and hug their crying Mom. She manages to maintain some composure. Sarah starts asking questions right away. She is the "in your face type". She gets in Amy's shit immediately. Gary and Jim stand back and listen. Amy tells them why she did what she did and how she is so sorry for breaking up the family and hurting everyone. They assure her that they love her and will do everything possible to help her fix it. The finally settle down and Amy goes hardcore into being the best Mom she can be for them. 

 *********************** 

 I spend the next few days apartment hunting and getting set up for my single life. I've already come to the conclusion that it's going to suck. I plunge ahead knowing I have no other choice. The kids come by at every opportunity to check up on me. Sarah offers to come and cook for me. I let her do it off and on. 

 I quickly decide I won't sit in my apartment and watch TV feeling sorry for myself. I find a nice watering hole nearby. It has a very friendly staff. I plan on becoming an expert at nursing drinks. The next business day I go back to work. My loyal secretary Sally, meets me with a smile and a hug. 

 "Good morning, Eric. Good to see you back at work. I was running out of things to do." 

 "Hi Sally, good to see you." 

 "How are you doing. Bring me up to date." 

 "Well, I moved out and got an apartment. Amy confirmed that the kids aren't mine. I decided the best thing was to come back to work instead of sitting around watching TV and feeling sorry for my self." 

 "I think you made the right decision. It's going to be hard for you. If there's anything I can to do help just let me know. I'm pretty good company and a good listener." 

 "Thanks, Sally. I know I can count on you." 

 "I guess you're ready. Here's a few messages for you. Nothing important." 

 "I have one important task. I intend to collect back child support from Mr. Sperm Donor." 

 "Are you going to hit him hard." 

 "Oh yes. I think a nice round number to start with is $400K if he wants to settle out of court. More if he want to go the legal route. He's a professor at Arizona State. I'm curious how his wife is going to react to all this. I don't think he can sneak that much out without her knowing." 

 I inform my boss that I'm back and pick up where I left off. I plan on staying as busy as possible but first I have Sally call Mr. Sperm Donor. 

 "Hello, Arizona State College. How may I direct you call?" 

 "May I speak with Mr. Brian Parsons please." 

 "May I tell him who is calling?" 

 "Yes. I'm Mr. Eric Jensen's secretary with Johnson, Williams and Benson Law offices." 

 "One moment please." 

 Ten seconds later. 

 "I'm sorry. Mr. Parsons isn't available right now. May I give him your number." 

 "Of course. It's (xxx) xxx-xxxx." 

 "Thank you." 

 "Thank you. Have a nice day." 

 Sally looks at me, smiles and gives me three fist pumps and a "YES! YES! YES! I would hate to ever get on her bad side. 

 Two hours later. 

 "Hello, Mr. Jensen's office. My name is Sally. How may I help you." 

 "umm This is Brian Parsons. Eric Jensen called me." 

 "Yes, Mr. Parsons, Let me connect you. Please hold." 

 She gives me another big smile and a thumbs up. 

 "Hello, Mr. Parsons. Thanks for returning my call. It's come to my attention that I've been supporting three of your children for the last twenty or so years." 

 "What is this. Is this a shake down.?" 

 "No, of course not. It's just a matter of some back child support." 

 "I guess Amy finally told you. The cat seems to be out of the bag, so to speak." 

 "Yes it is. I'm prepared to give you two choices. We can reach an agreement out of court or go the hard way and let the legal system take care of it. If you decide to settle it will save you quite a bit in legal fees." 

 "Have you decided on a figure?" 

 "Yes, but there is something else too. I want a notarized letter from you saying you, as their biological father give up all parental rights to the three children and that you agree not to communicate in any way with Amy or the children." 

 "I see. You drive a hard bargain, Mr. Jensen. What's the amount of the support.?" 

 "Well, based on $500 per month to the age of 21 for three children, I come up with just a little under $400K. Let's just round it off at $400K and call it all square. All three of your children intend to go to college. I'm sure you wouldn't want to deny that to them. It's my understanding you have three sons in college so I'm sure you're familiar with the cost of raising children." 

 "That's quite a sum. It will take me a while to come up with that much. Can you give me some time?" 

 "How much time would you need? Would thirty days be enough?" 

 "That should be enough time" 

 "Upon delivery of that amount I'll send you a notarized letter absolving you of any financial responsibility for your children and that I'm satisfied with the settlement." 

 "OK, I'll be in touch." 

 "Goodbye, Mr. Parsons." 

 Sally gives me a high five and a big hug. 

 "Well done, Eric. The shit will hit the fan there. I wonder if he wet his pants?" 

 "It's called the fucking you get for the fucking you got." 

 ************************* 

 The next week I find a counselor to help me with my problem. I explain what and how everything came to pass. I describe the emotions I'm feeling and what my goals are. This isn't her first rodeo and she comes up with a plan. As the video running thought my head is the big problem, she suggest that I try to desensitize myself to it. She wants me to let it run. She tells me it will cause pain and anger but she wants me to feel the emotions. The next step is for me to imagine it's a file on my computer and I'm running it on my video player. I'm supposed to run it and play with the stop, pause and play controls. This is supposed to give me control of it. I can run it at will, pause it, stop it at will and close the video player. The last step is for me to delete the file. She says that I'll always have a memory of the incident but it will just be just that, a bad memory. 

 Over the next few weeks I try what she asks. As she said, I feel all the emotions but they become less intense. Then I start playing with the controls. It works. I gain control of it. Then I start deleting it. It takes a while but the plan works. 

 Three days later the check from Mr. Sperm Donor comes by courier. I open a special account and deposit it. 

 The summer is over and Gary and Sarah go back to college. Jim decides he want to be a forensic investigator with the fire department. He enrolls in fire science courses online. I wonder, but never ask if he did this so him Mom wouldn't be living alone. He's a good kid and loves his Mom. 

 One Friday evening I'm about to go home for the day and Sally walks into my office. 

 "Eric, I've been watching you and I don't like what I see. You're spending too much time alone. Your kids are coming around but you're not getting out except going to that bar. How about we go out to dinner tonight. You need to get out and rejoin the rest of the world." 

 I smile at her. My ever present Sally. She always has my best interests in mind. I suspect she has some therapy of her own in mind, but I'm not sure what. I decide to go. 

 "OK, what time shall I pick you up?" 

 'I'll be ready at seven. I want a nice seafood dinner, and you're buying." 

 "Seven it is." 

 ****************** 

 Promptly at seven my finger is poised to ring Sally's doorbell. I take a deep breath and push. The door opens and my mouth falls open. He brown hair falls just below her shoulders. It frames her beautiful face. Her secretary glasses are gone. She is wearing her little black dress. It come down to mid thigh. I see beautiful legs clad in black thigh high hose from the hemline down. Not to mention plenty of cleavage showing. As my eyes move up and down she chuckles. I regain my senses and ask. 

 "Is Sally here? We're supposed to go out to dinner." 

 "She's indisposed. I'm going with you in her stead." 

 "Holy crap, Sally. Is that really you?" 

 "Yep, it's me. I decided to wear something different than my office garb." 

 "Wow. I knew you were nice looking but this off the scale." 

 "Why thank you, Eric. What a nice thing to say. Let me get my wrap and we can go." 

 I take her to Romano's. It's the best surf and turf place that I know of. The hostess seats us and I order a carafe of white wine. It's difficult for me to keep my eyes off her. I notice she is smiling as she watches me from the corner of her eye. The waitress comes and she orders the seafood combo. It has swordfish steak, razor clams and jumbo shrimp. Being a meat and potatoes man I order the fillet mignon with a baker. 

 "Eric, if you eat a fillet with white wine you'll explode." 

 "It's worth the risk. This is delicious." 

 "Mine is too. Good choice on this place. I'll make a note of it." 

 We chat and enjoy our meal. It's time to take her home. On the way home she asks. 

 "Eric, how are you and Amy getting along. I haven't heard you say much." 

 "Umm we're civil to each other. I'm finally getting my mind right. It's still too soon to think about getting back together. I need more time." 

 "I hope you two make it. You really had a good marriage." 

 "Yeah, had is the keyword. I really doubt if it will ever get back to what is was before." 

 "Is she seeing a counselor?" 

 "I don't think so. She hasn't mentioned it. I'm sure she would if she was." 

 "I probably shouldn't have mentioned it. I didn't want to bring a nice evening down at the end." 

 "It's ok. I had a great time tonight. You're good company. I have to admit, seeing you outside the office was a real eye opener. You're a very lovely woman." 

 "Aw, you say the sweetest things. But, Monday it's back the office secretary." 

 "You're a great secretary and a great friend. Thanks for being there for me." 

 "I think I'll have a craving for more seafood next weekend, so pencil me in." 

 "Consider it done." 

 I drop her off at her house with a hug and a quick kiss on the lips. She doesn't make a move and neither do I. 

 The next Friday evening she comes in the office. 

 "Tonight I want seafood and dancing. You're buying again." 

 "You're on." 

 I ring her bell and the door opens. This time she is wearing her little red dress. It has spaghetti straps which means no bra. Her hemline is mid thigh again. Red FM heels accent the red dress. She greets me with a hug and a kiss. She holds the kiss a little longer than the last one. I feel her firm breasts against me chest and my cock stirs. 

 We enjoy a nice dinner and move to the dance area. Even before we're seated she pulls me to the dance floor. It's a nice fast tango and I pleasantly discover she is not only beautiful but she's a great dancer. We find a table and I order a carafe of red wine. We dance to three fast ones in a row. She is beaming and it's obvious she is having a great time. A slow set starts and she pulls me up again. She moves into my arms and pulls up close to me. I feel her against my cock. It comes up to half hard. She looks up at me and smiles. She doesn't pull away. We stay out for two more slow ones. She hold my hand as we go back to our table. We sit and she looks at me. 

 "Eric. I want you to know something. I don't know if you've noticed that I don't ever mentions a steady boyfriend. It's because I don't have one. I do have some friends with benefits. After working with you all these years I realized that I was comparing all the men I met to you. None of them measured up. I never made a move on you because you had a wonderful marriage. I didn't want to be a home wrecker. I just want you to know. If you ever need me to be more than a friend or secretary just tell me." 

 I was dumbfounded. I never suspected she had feelings for me. 

 "Wow. I never suspected that. The way it is now, I can't start a relationship. I'm still married and there is a chance, however slim, that Amy and I will get back together. When I find out that won't happen you'll be the first one to know." 

 "I understand, Eric. Please don't let this influence your decision with Amy. That wasn't why I told you this. I'll always be your friend no matter what." 

 "Thanks, Sally. I've always felt you were there for me." 

 It's quiet as I drive her home. Many thoughts are running through my brain. They're all good. I drop her off with a nice hug and a kiss. 

 Saturday afternoon finds me sitting on my sofa watching sports program. My phone rings. I's Amy. 

 "Hi. Amy. What's up?" 

 "Hi Eric. I was thinking. I want you to come over this evening for dinner. I was planning on making your favorite lasagna. We haven't seen each other I a while. I thought it might me nice to spend an evening together." 

 I'm surprised at her offer. I wonder if she is planning on making a move on me. I think a minute and decide, "What the hell", let's see what happens. 

 "Sounds ok, Amy. What time?" 

 "How about seven, and you don't need to ring the doorbell." 

 There's that hook again. 

 "Ok, see you then." 

 I pull up in front of the house. One deep breath and I walk in. She greets me with a big smile and a hug. She is dressed in what she knows if my favorite dress. It's short and shows off her hot ass and legs. 

 "Come in and sit. Dinner is almost ready. I'll pour you a glass of wine." 

 I sit and watch her flit around the kitchen. I suspect she is as nervous as I am. We make idle chatter about the kids and what's going on with them. Sarah has a boyfriend, Gary is pulling down a 4.0 in all of his classes. Jim is taking fire science classes on line and is doing great. 

 We finish dinner and she leads me to the sofa. She sits close and her arm is just touching mine. As we chat she slowly moves closer. I put my arm around her shoulder. She immediately snuggles up against me. He breast against my side. She looks up and kisses me on the cheek. 

 "It's nice to be with you again, Eric. It's been a long time." 

 "Yes, it has, Amy." 

 She turns toward me and kisses me full on the lips. She holds her lips on mine, her tongue searching my lips. I open my lips and her tongue finds mine. I hear her moan and feel her nipples get hard against me. She always was a great kisser. It's impossible for me to resist. She pulls my hand to her breast. I hear her moan again as my hand closes on it. I tweak her nipple and our kiss gets hotter. Without breaking our kiss she turns and lays across my lap, both breasts against my chest. 

 "Eric, darling. Come to the bedroom with me. Let's try. Can we?" 

 I've come this far so I decide to go with her. She stands and pulls me up from the couch. I follow her into the bedroom. She moves into my arms and kisses me again. Our tongues meet and our passion raises. We slowly undress each other and fall on the bed. She quickly moves down and starts sucking my cock. It comes up full hard for her. She gets on top and drops on my cock. That hot pussy I remember so well wraps around my cock. She starts moving, taking me all the way in and then out. Then she rolls over and pulls me on top of her. She guides my cock into her dripping pussy. 

 "Oh god, baby. It's so good to have you back where you belong." 

 "I moan and push in all the way. I start stroking the way she likes it. She responds with moans and groans. She starts stroking up in rhythm with me. I can tell she is getting close. Her pussy muscles are squeezing me. Suddenly she throws her legs around my ass and locks her ankles. Her arms go around my neck. She pulls me down and thrusts up with her hips. 

 "Fuck me, baby. Cum in me. Cum in me hard. Please, baby. Cum in me. please. Please." 

 Then the worst happens. Her begging for my cum causes that picture to pop into my mind. I see her with her sperm donor laying in her saddle. I see her face twisted in ecstasy. My cock goes limp. I stop and lay still. It fucking happened. I had no control over it. She stops and just holds me. I feel her tears start. 

 "It's ok, baby. We can try again. It's ok." 

 I don't say a word. I just roll off her and sit on the side of the bed with my face in my hands. She starts crying full on. 

 "I'm sorry, Amy. I guess I'm not over it. I'm so sorry." 

 She hugs my back crying so hard she can't speak. I sit there a while as all the pain comes back. She lets go and falls on her pillow, sobbing. I stand up and start getting dressed. 

 "Amy, I think it's best if I go. I'm sorry." 

 I finish dressing and walk out. She watches me go, sobbing. 

 As I'm driving home the words keep running through my mind. "It won't ever work. I can't go back. It wont ever work. I can't go back."  

 

 ****** Cheat and Lie ****** byGotBaconÂ© I walk into my apartment and strangely it feels good. Like a sanctuary. I sit on the sofa and run the evening through my mind. It was going great till she started begging for my cum. She had no clue that it would set me off. It was just the way she is. Now I have to deal with that picture. I decide to use what my counselor taught me. 

 Over the rest of the weekend I play with my mental photo program. It's not a video this time. It's just a picture. I mentally blur her face out and click on the close window x every time it pops into my mind. Slowly the pains lessens as I see the picture. 

 Monday morning as I walk into my office, Sally knows at once something is wrong. 

 "Eric. Something is wrong. What happened?" 

 "Come in and sit. I need someone to talk to." 

 "I'm here. I told you I'll be here for you." 

 I sit and try to compose myself. Finally I can tell her. 

 "Amy invited me over for dinner. I decided to go and see how everything was. We had dinner and some wine. We tried to have sex and a picture of them in bed came into my head. I lost my erection. I all but ran away from her. I couldn't deal with it. 

 "Oh god, Eric. I'm so sorry. How terrible for both of you." 

 "It was. I've come to the conclusion that we won't ever be a couple again. There's just too much pain when I'm with her. I spent all weekend trying to get that picture out of my mind. I'm probably going to go back for more counseling. I thought I had it under control but I don't." 

 "I'll help you Eric. Any way I can. Just let me know." 

 "Thanks, Sally. I'll probably need to bend your ear from time to time." 

 I spend the next few weeks working with my counselor to get rid of the picture. Finally I get control and it's just a memory, much like the video. It's easier this time. 

 Christmas comes and goes. The kids come home and put up a small tree and decorate my house. We exchange gifts. The do well at keeping it cheerful. I'm eternally grateful for them. As the new year comes in Sally and I start our Friday night dinner and dancing. After six weeks of nice times with her, on one particular night we plan to go our again. 

 I ring her bell and she opens the door. I'm used to her looking hot when I see but this time I hesitate. She has on a blue dress. Spaghetti straps and it's shorter than any I've seen her wear before. It just covers her ass. He breasts sway as she steps back to let me in. I make a note in my mind. No bra. She puts her arms around my neck and we hold a long kiss. Her dress rides up and I see the bottom of her naked ass cheeks in a mirror behind her. My cock twitches. She notices and pushes against me. We hold each other, just enjoying the closeness. 

 "You ready? Let's go dancing." 

 We go to our favorite spot, eat dinner and move to the dance area. I take her in my arms at the start of the first slow set. We hold each other close. He arms are around my neck and I know the bottom of her cheeks are showing. She doesn't seem to mind. I look around and see all male eyes are on her. The don't appear to notice her pretty eyes. I see a couple of husbands get an elbow from their wives. Of course my cock gets hard and pushes against her. She just smiles and pushes back. We dance for another hour or so and decide to leave. 

 As I'm driving her home she has her hand on my thigh. I reach over and put mine on hers. She pulls it up till I feel her shaved mound. I feel around and find her moistness. She moves her hand to my cock. It's straining against my pants. She unzips my pants and pulls it out. She gently strokes it up and down while looking at me. I almost wreck twice before we get to her house. 

 I pull up in front of her house. She leans down and kisses the head of my cock. 

 "Bring that in the house. I have plans for it." 

 "What did you have in mind, dear." 

 "You'll see. Come with me." 

 She leads me straight to her bedroom. 

 "Sit and watch." 

 "Yes sir." 

 I sit on the bed and watch her. She slowly slips the straps off her shoulders and let her dress fall to the floor. She stands and lets me look at her. She has an amazing body. Her hips are just a little fuller than she would like. Her ass looks just fine to me. I nice saddle to lay in. 

 She pulls me up off the bed and starts slowly taking my clothes off. She watches as my pants fall. She touches my bulging cock through my boxer briefs. 

 "mmmm, nice lump you have there. Let's have a closer look." 

 She drops to her knees and pulls them down. I step out of them as she grabs it. She holds it and cups my balls. Her hands are like magic. She looks up at me, holding eye contact with me as she kisses my cock head. She pushes me back and I fall on the bed. She starts sucking and licking my cock. She gets it nice and wet and quickly throats me. I almost cum in her. She pulls off to slow me down. 

 "Oh fuck, Sally. You're amazing." 

 "I pride my self on my cock sucking ability. You just hang on and enjoy." 

 She goes to work with vigor. In just a few minutes I'm shooting my load down her throat. She pulls off and takes some in her mouth. She moves up and kisses me. She gives me a snowball. I've never tasted my cum before and I'm surprised. It's not that bad. She sucks it all back in her mouth and swallows it. 

 'You're a naughty little girl, Sally. I may have to spank you." 

 "Yes I am, and don't threaten me with a good time." 

 She spins around quickly and her pussy is in my face. She throats me again and I give my full attention to her pussy and asshole. She growls and sucks my cock. Suddenly she moves off me. 

 "Let's play Wolfie. You get behind me and fuck me like an Alpha male wolf taking his bitch." 

 She gets on her knees and sticks her pretty ass up in the air. I move behind her and grab her hips. Just before I stick it in I slap her hard on her ass. She squeals and pushes back. I slap her other cheek and slide my cock in her. Her pussy is soaked. He pussy juice is running down her legs. I push all the way in and slap her again. 

 "Oh fuck yes. Spank that ass. Make me howl at the moon." 

 I spank her ass and slam in and out of her. She growls and pushes back in time with each of my strokes. I reach around and find her clit. I massage it and smack her ass some more. She starts cumming. Her growls grow louder and she gets hotter. 

 "Fuck me. fuck me. fuck my hot pussy. Shove that big cock in me." 

 I smack her and pump in her faster and faster. She howls louder and louder. Finally I can't hold back any louder. I give her two hard slaps and thrust into her. My cum rockets out and blasts into her cervix. She cums with me making all kind of animal noises. We fall together on our sides. She quickly rolls over and hugs me. 

 "Damn, Sally. You're the hottest fuck in the state." 

 "She smiles at me and says, "Thank you." 

 We both have a chuckle and a hot kiss. 

 "Wolfie, huh? I kinda liked spanking that Alpha female ass." 

 "umm, we both did." 

 "I never suspected you were so hot in bed. You always seemed kinda reserved at work. What a switch." 

 "That was the professional side you saw there. This is the real me." 

 "Nice to meet you, Naughty Sally." 

 "You think I was naughty? Now I'm ready to give you may ass. Then I'll really howl." 

 "Oh my god. I've never had an ass before." 

 "We'll both love it. All we need is a condom and some lube." 

 She moves over and pulls the drawer of her nightstand open. She pulls out a condom and a bottle of lube. She rolls the condom on my cock and lubes it up. She sticks the nozzle of the bottle in her asshole and gets it ready. She smiles, looks at me and gets on all fours with her ass up in the air. 

 "Fuck my ass, Eric. Now." 

 I move around behind her. I reach up and grab both of her nipples. I pinch them and pull back. She squeals. I line my cock up with her little pink and shove my cock in to the hilt. She howls and cums. I hold her nipples back and stroke in and out. She clenches her muscles down on my cock as he meets each stroke with her own. 

 "Fuck my ass! Fuck my asshole. Ream me out and cum in me." 

 Her amazing tight ass muscles bring up a stirring in my loins. 

 "Here I come, my little bitch. Get ready for your Alpha Male to cum." 

 She clenches down again and we both cum as I fill the condom. We fall on our sides, gasping for air. 

 "My hot little bitch." 

 "My big Alpha Male." 

 I suspect she likes to talk dirty when she's fucking. I make a mental note to try it next time. 

 She finally regains her breath and sits up. She pulls of my condom and goes into the bathroom. I hear water running and the toilet flush. She come back with a wet wash cloth and a hand towel. She gently cleans my cock . She finishes and gives it a kiss. 

 "There, all spic and span." 

 She gets back in bed and lays with her head on my chest. She is holding my limp cock with one hand. 

 "Fun night, huh baby?" 

 "Sure was. You're my first ass fuck. Pretty fucking amazing. I suspect I'll want in there again." 

 "You're going to be in there a lot. You're going to be cumming in all my holes over and over." 

 "Challenge accepted." 

 She snuggles up to me and I pull up the covers. I switch off the bedside lamp and we fall asleep in each others arms. 

 **************** 

 I filed for a divorce. I gave half the $400K I got from Mr. Sperm Donor and the house. She didn't contest it. 

 I hear little bits and pieces from the kids. I heard that Mr. Sperm Donor got taken to the cleaners by his wife. Oh woe is me. NOT! 

 The kids tell me Amy is seeing a counselor. She is slowly getting her mind to accept that we are done. She is learning to forgive herself for what she did and all the pain she caused. 

 Sarah is in love with a really nice guy. He is planning on going to Harvard Law School. They plan on getting married when she finishes her sophomore year. I'm looking forward to some grand children. 

 Jim is almost finished with his fire science classes. He plans on applying near home. I think he wants to keep his eye on his Mom. 

 Gary is carrying a 4.0 average all the way through college. He is studying computer science. His professor thinks he swallowed a microprocessor and a mother board. 

 Sally and I are exclusive now. She understands that I'm taking it slow and has no problem with it. I notice her sitting kind of gingerly on her chair in the office. Sometimes she asks for some time off from getting spanked so she can heal up. We try to keep it very professional at the office. She teases me sometimes. She tells me she isn't wearing panties when she is standing next to me. I usually check and find her sweet shaved pussy all wet. We try to behave so we aren't the topic of all the office gossip. 

 A year later I move in with Sally. We get along great and I keep her ass sore for her. She loves it. She makes sure that I cum in all of her holes and on every part of her body. 

 Sarah got married and dropped out of school. I gladly sprung for a big wedding. Amy, of course, was there as well as Sally and I. Amy didn't snow any animosity toward Sally. I was thankful for that. I guess she has accepted that I've moved on. Sarah made me a grandpa nine months later. Sally and I flew out to see the baby. I send them money to help while her husband is in law school. Between his parents and I we take care of them. 

 Gary graduated with honors and got a job with a leading computer software manufacturing company. He specializes in writing builds on their existing products. He has a girlfriend and they are planning on getting married. 

 Jim got on with the county fire department. His reputation is spreading and he gets called by other counties to help out. He has a girlfriend but he has no plans on getting married. He us still living with Amy. I think he wants to take care of her. 

 A year later Johnson retired and I was made a full partner. Sally is now my personal assistant. Really personal. Report_Story
