She stared up at the ceiling and wondered just how in the hell she had managed to get herself in such a mess. And how in the hell was she going to get out of it. She was sure that George would take one look at her and know instantly what she had done. Oh Jesus what a mess. She didn't mean for it to happen. She felt the bed shift and he moved over her and without thinking she spread her legs wide. She felt his hard cock slide into her for the third or fourth time that night - she wasn't sure, it might even be the fifth - and she didn't fight it. But then other than the first time she hadn't fought and in truth even that first time she hadn't fought all that hard. Of course it hadn't hurt that he had given her one or two orgasms every time. 

 She tried not to think of George, Sarah and Julie as she pushed her hips up at him. She felt the tingle of an approaching orgasm and her hands gripped his ass and she pulled him deep into her and all thoughts of her family faded and she cried out: 

 "Fuck me, make me cum, fuck me hard and make me cum." 

 He fucked her hard for several more minutes, giving her two orgasms, and then she felt him spurt inside her. He rolled off of her and she drifted off to sleep. 

 She felt all warm and fuzzy as George licked and kissed her breasts and fingered her pussy. She stretched and opened her eyes and her heart almost stopped when she saw that it wasn't George. 

 "Oh good, you are awake" he said as a second finger entered her and began to rub her clit. Memories of the night before flooded in on her and while she knew she should push him away and get up and away from him the damage had already been done so what was one more time. His rubbing her clit made her moan and he said, "You are one hot woman" and he moved over her and took her again. And again and still yet again. 

 She was on her knees moaning into a pillow and he was pushing into her from behind when the phone rang. She tried to ignore it, but she knew she had to answer it. He slowed his strokes as she reached for the phone and picked it up. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Good morning sleepyhead." How are you feeling this morning?" 

 "Oh God George, you know I can't handle too much to drink. I've been awake for a couple of hours and I can't seem to get out of bed." 

 She heard a soft chuckle from behind when she said that and he pushed hard into her and she had to bite her lip to keep from moaning. 

 "What time do you think you will be home?" 

 "I need to force myself out of this bed, get some coffee in me and take a long hot shower. Say three hours maybe." 

 "I'll take the girls to the movies at the mall so you will have some quiet to help you recover." 

 "Thank you baby; you are so good to me." 

 She heard him suppress a laugh as he rammed his cock hard into her as deep as he could go and she felt another orgasm on the way. 

 "I have to go baby. I have to dash to the toilet." 

 "Okay sweetie; I love you." 

 "I love you too George." 

 She hung up and hissed, "You bastard! Were you deliberately trying to get me caught and into more trouble than I'm already in?" 

 "Hush lover; you know you are loving it." 

 He was right - she was - but she still didn't need to get caught. He started fucking her harder and she screamed as he gave her another orgasm. He pulled his softening cock out of her and said: 

 "Clean it." 

 She slid down and took him in her mouth and sucked on him and licked him until all traces of their mixed juices were gone and then she got off the bed and headed for the shower. 

 As she dressed he asked her when they could get together again. 

 "Never! Last night was a huge mistake, a terrible mistake that I should never have let happen. Now I need to get home and find someway to forgive myself for what I've done to my husband and family." 

 "What you did to your family? Honey, what you did you did for you. You loved every second of it and you know you did. Who was it who was pushing her ass back at me while talking to hubby dear on the phone? You might have had too much to drink last night, but you were damned sure sober enough to know what you were doing this morning - all three times. You are one hot bitch Shawna and I'm willing to wait. We will get together again and I know it." 

 "You are wrong about that, dead wrong" she said as she walked out of the hotel room. 

 +++++++++++ 

 As she drove home she thought about the night and wondered how she could have done what she had done. How could she have betrayed George? Her life had been perfect and in an evening - in eleven hours - she had risked throwing away a perfect marriage that had lasted for almost fifteen years. She had it all. The perfect husband that she was still madly in love with. Two beautiful and perfect daughters, a lovely home and it would all be gone if George ever found out. 

 Could she hide it from him? She had never lied to George before; she wouldn't know how. Would he take one look at her and know? It was just so damned unfair. It wasn't her fault, but even as she thought that she knew she was lying to herself. It was her fault. She knew she couldn't handle alcohol very well and yet she allowed herself to be given drink after drink at a party she shouldn't have gone to in the first place. The cocktail party was being held at the Marriott and it was work related, but she didn't have to be there. The only reason she went at all was because George was supposed to meet her there. 

 An hour into the party George had called her on her cell and had told her that he had some problems come up at work and he was running a little late and then he had told her to go ahead and enjoy herself since he was going to be the designated driver. She'd already had more than it was safe for her to have and still be able to drive when George had called again and said he wouldn't be able to get there before the end of the party so she should just go ahead and get a room for the night. She had done that and then had gone back to the party. Since she knew that she wouldn't be driving she kept on taking the drinks that were handed her. 

 She should have refused them. She knew she had a low tolerance for alcohol, but the safety of a room three floors up had deluded her. When the party had ended she had stumbled three times while leaving the room and Glen had offered her his arm and had walked her to her room. She had dropped her keys twice before Glen took them from her and unlocked the door to the room. 

 She remembered turning to say thank you and he had taken her in his arms and kissed her. She tried to push him away, but he kept on kissing her and kissing her and kissing her. She wasn't even aware that he had her blouse unbuttoned and her brassiere unhooked until he rolled one of her nipples between his fingers. She had instinctively arched her back and pushed her breast into his hand before she remembered that it wasn't George that she was with. She tried to break away, but Glen had picked her up and carried her over to the bed. He set her down on it and then had pushed her down on her back and then had gone after her right breast with his mouth while his hands played with the other. It was almost if he already knew how sensitive her breasts were and that working on them would turn her on. 

 She cried for him to stop what he was doing and let her up but he ignored her and kept working on her breasts. Her cries turned to moans and whimpers as he worked on her. When his hand slid into her panties she again tried to push him away, but he was so big and she was so small. When his fingers found her clit and began working on it her resistance, as ineffective and feeble as it was, began to fade. When she heard his zipper she moaned: 

 "You can't. It isn't right. I'm married and you can't do this." 

 He ignored her. When he pulled the crotch of her panties to the side and she felt the head of his cock pushing at her she had cried out: 

 "No! You can't! I'm married and I don't want this. Let me up damn it, let me up!" 

 He laughed and then he was in her. She lay there and silently sobbed as Glen fucked her. At least she did until the first orgasm hit her. After that he did what he wanted and she let him. She let him, she helped him and by the third time she was his slut and urging him on. She had sucked his cock, swallowed his cum and when he said he wanted to try her ass she hadn't said a word just got on her knees and elbows and waited. 

 How could she love George as much as she did and still behave like that? Glen was right; she had been pushing her ass back at him while she was on the phone with George and she had hurriedly hung up the phone because she was on the edge of another orgasm. And that gave her the most guilt of all. The orgasms! Glen had given her more in one night than George had given her in the last six months. She had loved every second of it after her first orgasm and now she hated herself because she had enjoyed it so much. As she turned onto her street she was saying, "Please God, don't ever let George find out. 

 +++++++++++++ 

 But George did find out! 

 True to what he had told her he had taken the girls out and she used her time alone to soak in the tube and contemplate the future. She would have to be extremely careful to not let anything slip out about what she had done. She would have to bury the guilt she felt at doing things with Glen that she had never done with George. Things like giving Glen her ass without protest when George had never been there. And George had wanted to go there but she would never let him. God, how could she have been such a slut? She had even sucked Glen's cock when he had pulled it out of her ass. 

 That was another thing she was going to have to address - working with Glen after spending that night with him. She didn't know if she could do it. She loved her job and George knew it so how would she be able to explain quitting? Sweet fucking Jesus; how did she let herself get in such a mess. 

 She was fixing dinner when George got home with the girls. He came into the kitchen and kissed her on the cheek and she flinched and hoped that he didn't notice. She was quiet during dinner and just listened to Sarah and Julie talk about their day at the mall with their dad. After dinner the girls wanted to watch the DVD of "Happy Feet" that they had bought at the mall. She sat quietly through the movie and a few times she noticed George looking at her with a facial expression that she couldn't read. Did he sense something? Could he possibly know? 

 She was the first one in bed and she pretended to be asleep when George got into bed with her. He would want to make love and she didn't want him to. She kept thinking of Glen and the way he had totally used her and she felt too unclean to let George touch her. She was up before George in the morning - she needed to do that because he sometimes liked to start the morning with a quickie - and she had breakfast ready when George and the girls got up. 

 She cleaned up the breakfast mess and then busied herself doing laundry and cleaning house. She avoided George as much as was possible. Every time she looked at him she remembered what she had let Glen do to her and the guilt was overwhelming so to keep the guilt from crushing her she avoided her husband. George wasn't stupid and he saw how she was behaving. It all came to a head when it was bedtime. 

 George was sitting on the bed when she came into the bedroom and he said: 

 "What happened Friday night Shawna?" Not "What's wrong Shawna; you seem like something is bothering you" or "What's going on honey; you don't seem like your usual self." 

 If it had been either of those two she might have been able to make up some small excuse, but "What happened Friday night" cut through her and the guilt forced her to pour it all out. She held nothing back. She told George everything in an effort to purge herself of the guilt she was carrying on her back. George sat there stunned as he listened to her and then there were several moments of deathly silence before George said: 

 "How could you? How could you do something like that to me? How could you let yourself throw away our marriage? How could you throw away everything?" 

 "It wasn't my fault George. He took advantage of my condition. You know how I get when I drink and you were the one who told me to go ahead and have a good time because you were going to be the designated driver." 

 "Were you still bombed the next morning Shawna?" 

 "You were supposed to be there George. If you had been there like you were supposed to be it never would have happened." 

 "So now it is my fault? I didn't pry your legs open and then hold them open so he could fuck you. After the first time why didn't you get up and leave the room? When he fell asleep why didn't you get up and leave? Why did you keep doing it in the morning?" 

 George got off the bed and grabbed his pillow and started to leave the room. 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "To the spare bedroom. Right now I just don't want to be around you." 

 "Please don't go George; stay here with me. I love you George, you know I do. It was a mistake George. I didn't mean to do it." 

 "Yes you did mean to do it Shawna. You might not have meant to do it initially, but you meant to do what you did the next morning." 

 He walked out of the room and she broke down and sobbed herself into an exhausted sleep. 

 ++++++++++++ 

 The next morning she got up and called into work sick, made a pot of coffee and then sat down at the kitchen table and waited for George to come down. After a half an hour when he still hadn't appeared she got up and went upstairs to the spare bedroom and knocked. When she got no response she opened the door and saw that George wasn't in the room. She looked and saw that his car was gone and she broke down crying again. 

 She spent a bad day waiting for George to come home. They needed to talk. George needed to understand that it was a one time mistake and that it would never happen again. She had to make sure that he knew that she loved him, loved being married to him and that she would do whatever she had to do to make it up to him. She hadn't meant for it to happen. God knows she hadn't meant for it to happen. Yes, she had stupidly let it continue, but the damage had already been done and she knew that George would never find out so what was the harm? She hadn't counted on the guilt that she would carry around. The crushing guilt that had caused her to confess. Shouldn't that confession count for something? She told George what had happened. She didn't have to. She could have lied and made up a believable story about why she had seemed so distracted, but she didn't lie - she told him just what had happened. 

 Sarah and Julie got home from school and she helped them with their homework until it was time to start dinner. Dinner was a quiet affair and she didn't get a chance to talk to George until after the girls had gone to bed. Only they didn't talk, George talked. 

 "I've spent all day thinking of nothing except what you told me last night and the more I thought about it the angrier I got and the more disgusted with you I became. Why in God's name did you have to tell me all of it? If you had just told me about the first time and then let me believe that it was the only time I might have been able to work through it, but you spent the entire night and a good part of the next morning doing whatever he wanted and I can not work through that. 

 "I've made a hard decision. I've decided not to toss you out on your cheating ass and I've decided that I'm not going to move out either. For the sake of the girls we will pretend that there is no problem. We will give them as stable a life as is possible. I will move into the spare bedroom and we will tell the girls that my loud snoring is keeping you awake at nights and that is why I am in the other bedroom. You of course do not have to accept this. You may, if you so choose, pack your bags and leave, but if that is what you choose to do we will have to tell Sarah and Julie why you are going. Your choice." 

 He stood up and began moving everything of his into the other bedroom leaving her to think about what he had said. Moving out was not an option. Moving out would take her away from George and she did not want that. Maybe, as he'd said, he couldn't work through what she had done, but that was now. She loved him and deep inside she knew that he knew she loved him and she knew -- just knew - - that as long as they stayed together she would eventually win him back. No, she wasn't leaving; she was staying put. She would get her perfect life back. It might take a little time, but she would get it back. 

 +++++++++++ 

 Months went by. Months during which she and George were civil to each other and kept up appearances for Sarah and Julie. They were also months of George being totally unbending. Months during which her complete lack of sexual activity were weighing on her. She was horny as hell and the situation was not helped any by seeing Glen every day at the office. She had to see him. It was unavoidable. Given her current situation she could not afford to quit and go looking for another job. She needed to keep the one she had just in case things with George went from bad to worse. 

 Glen of course kept after her; kept asking her if she was ready to do it again, kept saying things like, "I'm free tonight, can you get loose?" Once he leaned over her as she sat at her desk and whispered: 

 "You want it Shawna, you know you do. Come on sweetie, let's get together tonight." 

 She had yelled, "Leave me alone!" at him so loud that half the people in the office turned to look at them. The worst part of it was that he was right. She did want to. The longer she went without George touching her the more she wanted to. Not necessarily Glen, but somebody! When she did think of it she of course thought of Glen and the way he had used her and made her like it. She fought it. She knew that if she gave in to the need and George found out it would surely put an end to any hope that she might have of saving her marriage. 

 She redoubled her efforts to get something going with her husband. Cards, candy and flowers on Valentines Day and Sweetest Day. Gifts on Father's Day and his birthday. She fixed his favorite meals and did everything she could think of to show him that she loved him, that she was his and that she wanted and needed him, but even after six months if she touched him he would jerk away from her like he had just touched a hot stove. And then one night when they were in the kitchen alone she asked him: 

 "Is there really no chance for us George?" 

 He had looked at her and then had looked away without saying a word, but she didn't need words to know that he had just answered her question. 

 "I'm sorry George; I am really and truly sorry, but at least you can't say that I didn't try." 

 To be continued...

He leaned back against the headboard, propped up by pillows and tried to get into the book he was reading, but it just couldn't hold his attention. The question that Shawna had asked in the kitchen was still sitting on his mind. Was there a chance for them? Could he ever get by what she had done? He wanted to; he really did want to. He loved Shawna and he always had. He had loved her from the very first moment he had been introduced to her. She had been the light in his life for over sixteen years. For fifteen of those years she had been the perfect wife; all that any man could ask, wish and hope for. 

 He thought back to the day his sister had introduced him to Shawna. Shawna had offered her hand and as he had taken it he had felt a tingle, a little spark and he knew in that instant that she was the woman he was destined to spend his life with. He was stunned when Shawna had asked: 

 "Did you feel it too?" 

 He knew exactly what she was asking and he nodded his head yes. 

 "Am I missing something here" his sister had asked and he and Shawna had laughed. 

 From that moment on he and Shawna had been inseparable. They had dated for two months before they had slept together and like everything else about her it had been perfect. They each seemed to know instinctively how to touch, where to touch and what to do to bring the most pleasure to the other and that had not changed through fifteen years of marriage. Unlike some of their friends who had grown complacent as their marriages went on he and Shawna had kept things fresh and exciting and still had been making love three and four times a week. That is they had been until THAT night! 

 Her confession had crushed him. He had wanted to curl up and die. The enormity of it had stunned him. A quick drunken indiscretion he probably could have handled. He would have been angry and upset at her and probably even disgusted, but one time he could probably have worked through. He could see how, given her low tolerance for alcohol, that it could have happened. It would have taken some time but he did love her and he would have eventually been able to put it behind him. It would have been a long time, if ever, before he would have been able to trust her out of his sight at a party or similar type affair, but he would have gotten by it. 

 But how in God's name could he get by what she had confessed to? Why couldn't she have just told him about the first time and how sorry she was to have let it happen? But she hadn't just told him about the first time; she had told him everything! How many times and what she had done each time and how the hell was he supposed to get by that? What happened that night was bad enough, but three times the next morning? And while she was talking to him on the phone? 

 Now she wanted to know if there was a chance for them. He wished that there was. He missed her. He missed everything about her, but how could there be a chance for them when every time she touched him he saw an image of her on her knees taking another man's cock up her ass. An ass that she had never given him. How could there be a chance for them when every time he saw her with a phone in her hand he saw the image of her talking to him on the phone while the asshole she worked with fucked her from behind? 

 He loved her, God knows he did, but he just could not get by those images that played in his head. There was a way that he maybe, just maybe, could make it happen, but he could not bring himself to do it. It was his sister's suggestion. He and Marie were very close and he had no secrets from her. She noticed the dynamic between him and Shawna and she had asked him about it. He told her the story of what had happened and his inability to get by it and Marie told him that the answer was simple. 

 "Find yourself a willing woman and have a one night stand. Yours cancels out Shawna's." 

 "You make it sound easy, but that is just something that I can't do. I'm not that way. I'm married and to have sex with another woman would not be right." 

 "Well you have to do something George. You love her and everyone knows you have since the day you met, and what's more she loves you and you know it. Have you asked her why she did it?" 

 "I told you. She said that Glen took advantage of her when she'd had too much to drink." 

 "That's how it started George, but why did it continue? Why did she do it the next morning after the effects of the drinks had worn off?" 

 "Does it matter Marie? To me all that matters is that she did it. That's what I can't accept. A drunken one time indiscretion is one thing, but what Shawna did is more than I can ignore no matter why she did it." 

 "You have to do something George. You either have to forgive, move out or toss her out, but you can't keep going on the way you are." 

 "Toss her out? I thought she was your friend?" 

 "She is George and if you do toss her out I'll probably offer to let her stay with me until she can get set up some place, but you are family George - you come first. I don't know what George, but you have to do something." 

 Marie was right, he did need to do something, but for the life of him he couldn't think of what. He had thought about Marie's "one night stand" suggestion. He had even gone so far as to check out a few of the women at work and there were several who were sexually appealing. One night he had stopped after work with several of the people he worked with for drinks and a couple of the women had shown a little interest in him; nothing really overt, but he could tell they were checking him out. But every time he worked himself up to make a move on one of them he chickened out at the last minute. He just wasn't that way. He was a faithful husband even if it was to an unfaithful wife. 

 God, his head hurt. Every time he thought about it his head hurt. He put the book down and tried to go to sleep. 

 +++++++ 

 "Good morning sexy lady." 

 She looked up from the spreadsheet on her desk and saw Glen standing there. "How about it" he asked, "Is today going to be the day?" 

 As she looked at him she thought of the way George had responded to her question the previous evening and she thought of the six months that she had hungered for George's touch, just the touch of his hand even, and the six months that he had given her nothing to hope for. She was a healthy woman with a healthy woman's wants and needs and it was now obvious to her that she was never going to get what she wanted and needed from George. 

 She looked at Glen standing there smiling down at her and expecting to be told to go away from her and leave her alone and she said, "Sure, why not." 

 She saw the disbelief on his face and he said, "You mean it? Today is the day?" 

 "I mean it." 

 "You want to meet someplace after work or can we leave here together and I'll bring you back for your car?" 

 "Neither. I have to go home first and fix dinner for my family. I'll meet you some place around eight." 

 "How about Bud's Bar?" 

 "No, I'm not interested in drinking. Let's make it the lobby of the Marriott. It will save some time if you already have a room." 

 "Eight o'clock at the Marriott it is" and he walked away whistling and with a smile on his face. 

 At the dinner table she told Sarah and Julie that they had to do the dinner dishes that night, "And make sure that you have your homework done before you settle down in front of the TV. 

 "Can you help me with my math homework" Julie asked. 

 "Your father can help you tonight sweetie. I have to go out for a while." She saw George look up from his plate and she looked him in the eye and added, "Mommy is going to visit a sick friend." 

 She was just stepping into a pair of high heels when George came into the room. "Do I know this sick friend?" 

 "No George, you don't." 

 "You need a short skirt and high heels to visit a sick friend?" 

 "He is very sick and he needs lots of cheering up." 

 "He?" 

 "Yes George, he!" 

 "Is it him?" 

 "What does it matter George? You don't want me. All you want is for me to be here and pretend that everything is fine so the girls will have a stable home life. I'm doing that George, but I will not spend the rest of my life living like a cloistered nun because you can't get it through your thick skull that I love you and want you. I've spent the last six months trying to show you how much I love you and want you, but I've gotten nowhere. The look you gave me last night when I asked if there was any chance for us showed me that you are never going to unbend so I'm done trying George. I'll keep up appearances for the girl's sake, but as I just said, I will not live the life of a nun. I'm yours George - if you want me." 

 He just looked at her and said nothing so she walked over to the dresser, picked up her purse and headed for the bedroom door. "Good night George" and she walked by him and left the house. 

 ++++++++++ 

 He slowly came awake. At first he thought he was waking up from a wet dream, but as his senses came alive he saw the form bending over him and felt the mouth working on his cock. He utter a "Wha..." and started to sit up, but a hand in the middle of his chest pushed him back down and the form rose over him, straddled him and he felt his cock slide into a vagina. The mental fog dissipated and he realized that Shawna had mounted him. He felt her sliding up and down on his erection and he wondered why she was there. She knew how he felt so what was she doing? Unfortunately, she told him. 

 "Feel him George? He put his sperm in me five times tonight. He was a stallion George. The more he fucked me the more he wanted me and the more he wanted me the more he fucked me. He wanted me George; unlike you he wanted me. Notice how easy you went in George? He opened me for you George. That's his cum that lubed me up so you could go in easy. Do you like the feeling George? Do you like the hot, wet, slick feeling of sliding your cock in another man's juices? I can barely feel you George. He really did a number on my pussy tonight George. Did I mention that he did me five times George? God but it was so good. And orgasms George? He gave me so many that I lost count. Oh God George, just thinking about it is giving me another orgasm." 

 She screamed and her nails dug into his shoulders and her body shook in a way that he knew only too well and then she collapsed like a rag doll. She shuddered a couple of times, took a couple of deep breaths and then got off of him and off the bed. 

 He had been surprised when she woke him and then had been stunned by what she was saying. He had lain there and stared up at her in disbelief as she spewed out what she had done. He could not believe that she could do such a thing and he had just looked up at her while she had done it. By the time he had gotten a grip on himself she had gotten herself off and it wasn't until she got off the bed that he realized that she had left him there with an aching hard on and half way to an orgasm of his own. 

 She looked down at him lying on the bed, dick pointing up at the ceiling and said: 

 "You can take care of that by hand George or if you want you can follow me to my bedroom and ask me to help you out. I won't make you beg George; I should, but I won't. But you will have to ask me George" and then she left the room. 

 "YOU FUCKING BITCH!" he screamed at her as the door closed. He remembered every word she had said as she rode him and his cock wilted and as it died he made himself a promise. He would go without no longer! Shawna wasn't going to be a nun? Well, he wasn't going to be a monk or a priest! To hell with being faithful to a whore. 

 ++++++++++ 

 He was up and gone the next morning before Shawna or the girls woke up. He stopped for breakfast at the Village Inn and then went into work. As he passed through the office he found himself checking out the women who were already at their desks. Several of them were in the group that usually stopped for drinks after work and a couple of them looked up at him and smiled. One of the ones who had smiled was one of the ones who had shown some interest in him the last time he had stopped with the group. He planned on stopping after work and if she was there and if she still showed an interest he was going to do something about it. No more backing off; no more honoring his vow to the woman who had stabbed him in the back. Stabbed him in the back not once, but twice. 

 It was a rough day at work for him. He wasn't really able to concentrate on his job what with thinking about what Shawna had done to him the night before and what he was hoping to do that night. 

 Finally it was five o'clock and he saved what he had been working on and then backed up the days work (what little of it he had gotten done) onto the external hard drive and then shut his computer down. He hit the men's room and washed his face and hands and combed his hair and then he headed for Terry's Lounge. 

 He didn't see any of his co-workers there, but decided to stay for at least one drink and he grabbed a booth of to the side of the dance floor. The waitress had no sooner set his drink in front of him than the door opened and Marge, Brenda, Sally and Bill walked in. They spotted him in his booth and came over and joined him. Before their drinks arrived Beverly, Carol, John and Warren came in. Two tables were shoved together, some money was fed into the juke box and those who wanted to talk shop did while the others got up and danced. 

 He wasn't too sure of himself and he hung back and watched until Carol came over, took his hand and pulled him up from his seat. 

 "No wallflowers allowed Georgie; not when there are girls who want to dance." 

 She led him out onto the dance floor and since it was a slow number he took her in his arms and she moved in close. Carol was one of the women who had shown an interest and while she wasn't the best looking of the girls she did have the biggest tits and he was a tit man. Thinking of tits made him think fleetingly of Shawna. He was a tit man and yet he had married Shawna. She had nice tits, but they were not big and pillowy like Carol's. 

 As he steered Carol around the dance floor he wondered how best to make a move. He was over sixteen years out of the dating game and add to that the fact that every woman at work knew he was a married man. Not only did they know he was married, but they knew that in the nine years they had worked with him he had been Mr. Straight Arrow. How did he get around that now? 

 It turned out that he didn't have to. Holding Carol, smelling her perfume and looking down into her cleavage had given him an erection and as Carol danced close to him she had felt it. She looked up at him (she being 5'1'' and he being 6 ft) and asked: 

 "Did I do that?" 

 He looked a little sheepish and she asked, "Any chance I can have it Georgie? It is only fair you know. If you got it from me I should be able to share shouldn't I?" 

 He was way out of practice when it came to the game of seduction, but he wasn't stupid and he had just been given as open an invitation as he was ever likely to get. 

 "It is yours if you want it." 

 "Oh I want it Georgie; I most definitely want it. Two questions Georgie." 

 "What?" 

 "Do we have to sneak out of here? Do you care if we are seen leaving together? Secondly, since I'm assuming that we can't go to your place are we talking backseat, motel or my place?" 

 "Why three options? Why not just go to your place?" 

 "Backseat is quicker and motel is closer. Takes twenty-five minutes to get to my place from here." 

 "I didn't care for backseats when I was a teenager and I doubt that I would like them any more now. And now that I think about it I think motel instead of your place." 

 "Why?" 

 "A motel is like neutral territory. I think that is what I need for my first time." 

 "Your first time? You've never played around before? Honest?" 

 "Honest. I've been a good boy up until tonight." 

 "Then let us get out of here and to a motel Georgie and I'll show you what you have been missing." 

 There were several raised eyebrows when he and Carol left together and he smiled as he thought about how busy the office gossips were going to be the next day. 

 There was a Motel 6 three blocks from Larry's and he signed in and got a room. As he unlocked the door he wondered what Carol liked in the way of foreplay. It turned out that he needn't have given it a thought. She quickly stripped and lay on the bed with her legs spread wide. 

 "Don't waste time Georgie, just put it in. I'm as ready as I'll ever be." 

 He told her it would probably be quick since it had been a long time for him and she had giggled and said: 

 "As long as it isn't the only time Georgie." 

 It wasn't. The first time was as quick as he feared it would be, but Carol had gotten him up again with a world class blow job and he had done much better the second time and still better the third time. 

 Carol was next to him, leaning on an elbow and looking down at him as she fondled his cock. 

 "So tell me Georgie, what made you fall off the wagon?" 

 "I didn't fall off, I was pushed off." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "It means that the bitch I am married to decided to try someone else and then she expected me to live with it. And then since I wouldn't live with it she went out and did it again and then rubbed my nose in it." 

 "So tonight is a one time revenge fuck?" 

 "Whether it is one time or not is up to you, but no, it is not a revenge fuck. I just finally decided that I wasn't going to go without anymore and since I won't touch the bitch that meant that I had to go out looking. For what it is worth I didn't go into tonight expecting anything to happen, but I will tell you that I'm glad it did." 

 "I've already made plans to have dinner with my parents tomorrow, but I have no plans for the rest of the week or the weekend." 

 "I can't on the weekends. That is when I spend quality time with my daughters." 

 "Day after tomorrow then?" 

 "It's a date." 

 "Do we need neutral ground anymore?" 

 "I don't think so." 

 "Good. My place and I'll fix us dinner." 

 "Why would you want to do that?" 

 "Do what? Fix us dinner?" 

 "No. Why get involved with a married man?" 

 "Simple Georgie. I like sex. I like having a man around sometimes. Sometimes is the key word here Georgie. I have been married twice and both marriages went bust. I found out that although I like sex and having a man around I am incapable of living with one. And it isn't just men. I tried sharing a house and an apartment with other girls, but that didn't work out either. I just can't live with anyone else without them eventually getting on my nerves. So, since I like sex and I can't get married I date and the men that I like to date are married and I like to date then for several reasons, chief among them the fact that they are already taken and are not expecting anything long term. Like you Georgie."

 The house was dark when he got home, but he had expected it to be. The girls had school in the morning and Shawna had to work so they would all be in bed. He moved quietly through the house so as not to wake any one and it wasn't until he was undressed and was ready to climb into bed that he had the idea. It was not a nice idea, but then what Shawna had done to him wasn't nice either. He needed some payback. 

 He crossed the hall to what used to be his bedroom and quietly let himself in. He moved over to the bed and carefully climbed on it. He positioned himself so that he was next to Shawna's head. She was sleeping naked on her back which is what she always did. He reached for the nipple of her right breast and started rolling it between his thumb and forefinger. Her breasts were very sensitive and breast play had always been the way to fire her up quickly. 

 It took a minute or so until she reacted. Her body moved and she moaned. She slowly awoke and realized what was happening and she murmured, "Oh George" and he pushed his cock against her lips. She opened her mouth and he pushed inside. She started sucking on him and he kept rolling the nipple and her body started to squirm. Her hands cupped his ass cheeks to hold him in place as she worked on his cock. He gave her about a minute and a half and then he said:  

 

 

===

"Can you taste her Shawna? I came in her three times. Do her juices taste good? She wanted me to stay longer and do it some more Shawna, but I wanted to hurry home and give you a taste of her while she was still wet on my cock." 

 He pulled out of her mouth and got off the bed and as he was leaving the room he said, "Good night Shawna. Sleep tight." 

 He debated being gone in the morning and eating breakfast at the Village Inn or sitting across the table from her and glancing at her face from time to time as he sipped his morning coffee and read the morning paper. He decided to stay home. He was curious as to how she was going to take what he had done. He remembered her howl of outrage as he left the room. "You bastard! You miserable bastard!" she had cried as he closed the door behind him. She apparently didn't like the shoe being on the other foot. 

 He had the coffee made and was sitting at the table working on his second cup and reading the sports section of the paper when she came down. It would be another twenty or thirty minutes before the girls would get up so they were alone. Shawna poured herself a cup of coffee and then sat down across from him. She stared at him in silence as he read the box scores from the previous day's games and then she said: 

 "I want to thank you for last night George." 

 He looked up from the paper and asked, "For what?" 

 "For setting me free George. After last night I know that we are dead. I know that there isn't any hope for us now and I can get on with my life. I can put an end to trying to get you to come back to me. You aren't coming back and I know that now." 

 "What does last night have to do with it? You knew, or should have known, that when you woke me up the other night you killed any chance there might have been that I would come to forgive you. The first time was bad enough Shawna, but after the other night? No way in hell!' 

 "Nothing happened the other night George. I went out to pick up a man and get myself laid, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I called Marie and asked her to meet me for drinks and conversation. All that I had in me when I came to you in the bedroom was a pussy full of KY." 

 "I'm supposed to believe that?" 

 "Call your sister and ask her." 

 "Why would you do that? Load yourself up with lube and then tell me that it was another man's leavings?" 

 "Shock value George. I was desperate. I wanted you back and nothing that I did was getting me anywhere. What was supposed to happen, what I hoped would happen, was that when I got off the bed and left the room leaving you all hot and bothered you would come after me. You were supposed to yell at me that I couldn't just leave you like that. We would make love and then I would tell you the truth about the night with Marie and we would fall asleep in each others arms. Stupid idea looking back on it now, but as I said, I was desperate. I hoped that by pretending I had been with some one else would make you jealous and make you want to fight for me. Like I said, a stupid idea, but what the hell, nothing else I tried had worked. I loved you George and I desperately wanted you back in my life." 

 She glanced at her watch and said, "Time to get the girls up" and she got up and left the room. 

 ++++++++++++ 

 As he drove to work he wondered how a woman, a usually smart woman, could possibly think that telling her husband that she had just come from fucking another man and then rubbing his face in it could make him want to fight for her. But then he thought was it really so far fetched? He had almost gotten up and followed her. What would have happened had he done it? Could it possibly have turned out the way she had hoped? Was she telling him the truth? She had to be. She knew he would call Marie and ask. Besides, she had never lied to him before. She had even told him everything about the night she had screwed up and if she wouldn't lie about that, why lie about going out with Marie? He would have to call Marie. If what Shawna told him was true could he finally get past what she had done the night of the party? Would the hours that he had spent with Carol do what Marie had suggested? Would his screwing Carol cancel out Shawna screwing the guy the night of the party? He loved Shawna and he knew it, but he had just not been able to get by what she had done the night of that stupid party. Now that he had spent some time with Carol were they really even? Had one offset the other? 

 She watched him as he backed down the driveway and thought about what she had just done. She had lied to George for the first time since she'd met him. She thought back to the night she had left the house to meet Glen. He had been waiting in the lobby of the Marriott and they had gone straight up to the room that he had already arranged. There had been no preliminaries, no foreplay; they both knew why they were there. Just strip, get on the bed and fuck. 

 Glen had fucked her hard and she'd had orgasm after orgasm until he finally came in her. He pulled out and she scrambled for his cock and sucked it into her mouth and in minutes she had him hard as a rock. She turned and got on her knees and elbows and he laughed and said: 

 "I knew you were a nympho and I knew I was going to fuck you again." 

 "Just shut up and do it" she had cried and he had driven his cock hard into her. She had three more orgasms before he came in her and pulled out. Once again she had gone for his cock and had gotten him up again and then he had put her legs up on his shoulders and fucked her hard and she'd had orgasm after orgasm until he finally came. He started to pull out, but she had clutched at him and had tried to pull him back in. He laughed again: 

 "Oh yeah baby, I knew what a hot bitch you could be. You were a slut just waiting to be set free." 

 He reached for the bedside phone and punched in a number. "Who are you calling" she had asked. "A friend of mine. I'll get him up here to help me out. Between the two of us we should be able to give you all that you need." 

 "Hang up that phone. I am not going to get involved with a stranger." 

 "Okay, no stranger. I'll call one of the guys from work. Some one who won't be a stranger. Got a preference?" 

 She got off the bed and started dressing. 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "Away from you you fucking asshole." 

 "Oh come on Shawna. You like to fuck and you like being bossed. I saw that the first time. You have a bit of the submissive in you and you like being taken and told what to do. Now get those clothes off and get your ass back down on that bed." 

 "Fuck you Glen" she said as she walked out of the room. 

 By the time she got to the lobby she had realized that the evening had been a bad idea to begin with. Oh she had needed the fuck that Glen had just given her and if he hadn't been such an asshole she would have stayed in that room with him and fucked him all night. The sad part was that she didn't want Glen, she wanted and needed George, but she needed sex and George wasn't having anything to do with her. And after what she had just done there was no way he ever would have anything ever to do with her ever again unless....unless she could convince him that nothing had happened, that she was just trying to shock him. But how to do that? 

 She had called Marie and had asked for help. She asked Marie to join her for drinks and Marie had agreed to meet her. She had told Marie that she had left home with the intention of getting laid, but had chickened out at the last minute. 

 "I need sex Marie. George hasn't touched me since the night I got drunk and was taken advantage of. I'm desperate Marie, but I knew that if I followed through on what I was going to do tonight my relationship with George would be truly dead and over." 

 "George loves you Shawna. We have talked about what is going on between the two of you. His problem is not that you were taken advantage of initially, but that you stayed and kept on doing it. You have to find a way to get passed that. Have you given any thought as to why it happened? And is it something that you could explain to George?" 

 "I know why it happened, but I don't have a clue how I could tell George and not drive him even farther away from me." 

 "How do you know if you don't try?" 

 "Oh sure. I can see it now. "I stayed and kept doing it honey because I loved it! It was great and I had more orgasms in that one night then I'd had in the previous six months and I didn't want to stop." I can see George taking me in his arms and saying, "That's okay honey. I'm glad you had a good time." 

 "I see your point. George would not react well to that at all. What you need to do is find some way to make him realize that he is going to lose you if he doesn't do something. You need to make him want to fight for you - to fight to keep you." 

 "Well he didn't seem too pleased that I was going out tonight. Maybe he does care. Maybe I can make him think that I will be gone if he doesn't do something." 

 "All I can say is good luck and I hope you can pull it off. I know he loves you and you say that you love him so I'll be pulling for you." 

 When she had gotten home that night she'd had a couple of drinks in her and that had given her the 'dutch courage' to do what she had done. She was ashamed of herself now, but at the time she was pissed at George for making it necessary for her to do what she had done. She had felt really good sitting on George and telling him he was sliding in Glen's sperm and she had hoped - expected actually - that George would follow her, but he hadn't. 

 She had cried herself to sleep and the next morning she had hated herself for what she had done. She had gone too far and last night George had given her what she had deserved. Tears welled up in her eyes as she watched George back out onto the street and drive away. She had lost him and she had no one to blame but herself. 

 ++++++++++++ 

 He managed to make it until eleven before he finally gave in to the need to call Marie. She backed up what Shawna had told him and then she had said: 

 "You are running out of time George. She loves you, but she isn't made of stone. Last night she dodged the bullet, but sooner or later she is going to do what she almost did last night and when that happens the two of you are toast. I know you love her George and right now you have a chance, but don't wait too long brother." 

 He spent a long day thinking about what Marie said and by quitting time he had resolved himself to sitting down with Shawna to try and work things out. 

 +++++++++++ 

 "You over your snit yet?" 

 She looked up to see Glen standing there. "Actually no Glen. In fact, just looking at you is turning my stomach. I'm only going to say this once so pay attention. Stay away from me. Don't even say "good morning' when we pass each other in the hall. Stay the hell away from me or I will file sexual harassment charges against you." 

 "You seem to forget you were willing." 

 "Only you and I know that so it will be your word against mine and what I have going for me is that the other day everyone on this floor heard me tell you to leave me alone. The first time you took advantage while I was drunk and why that didn't tell me that you were a slime ball I don't know, but you sure let me know last night. Get away from me Glen and stay away from me." 

 He started to say something, but then closed his mouth, turned and walked away. As he walked away she thought it was a shame he was such a dirt bag. She had enjoyed fucking him. Now that George was lost to her she was going to need a fuck buddy and Glen had certainly known how to push her buttons. 

 By quitting time she was feeling sorry for herself. She called home and told Sarah that she and Julie would have to fix dinner for their father and themselves and then she left work to join her co-workers at the bar across the street. 

 He was surprised when he got home to find that Shawna wasn't there. "She called" Sarah said, "And said she was stopping after work with some of the people she works with." 

 "Did she say what time she would be home?" 

 "No. She just said to make sure that we did our homework before we watched any TV." 

 "Then I guess we are on our own. What do you want for dinner?" 

 "Julie and I have already started dinner. We are having tacos." 

 As he sat down to dinner he wondered if he should make sure that he was still up when Shawna got home so they could have their talk. He decided that he would stay up until ten and if she wasn't home by then they could talk the next day. 

 She couldn't believe it! What had happened to her? Fifteen years of being faithful to one man and then one drunken indiscretion that led to six months with no sexual activity at all which led to another brief session with Glen and now this. On the back seat of a car! She had never been on a back seat even when she was single. And with a guy who was at least ten years younger that she was! She couldn't even blame it on alcohol since all she'd had was one glass of white wine and then she had switched to soda water. 

 But the kid was good. Well, maybe not good - at least not compared to George or Glen - but he sure was energetic and long lasting. The most amazing part was that she had gone after him. She had picked him out and had gone after him. She still had trouble believing it. That was just so unlike her. She hadn't even stopped at the bar looking to hook up. Her only reason for stopping after work is that she didn't really want to go home and face George. Knowing that it was over between them hurt enough; she didn't need to have it driven home by sitting across the dinner table and looking at him avoiding having to look at her. 

 She had been there a little over an hour sipping her one white wine and talking to her co-workers. She had danced with a couple of the guys and then the group started breaking up as people left to go home. Pretty soon she was sitting alone and that was when Toby came up to her and asked her to dance. She danced two numbers with him and then he had invited her to join him at his table. He was with two other guys and she had danced with all of them and after fifteen minutes at their table she had decided that one of them was going to get lucky. 

 Now that the relationship with George was dead she was going to have to do something to insure that she had a sex life. She didn't intend to have it by being a bar pick-up, she would find something steady, but right then she was ready to get laid and there were three guys to choose from. She would give George and the girls a stable home, but she would also give herself a sex life and she was going to start it right then and there. 

 She looked at the three young men and then she asked Toby, "What are you going to do when you leave here?" 

 None of the three were stupid and they understood that she had just made her choice and they knew what she intended. Toby said: 

 "I was thinking of maybe going for a workout, but I think that the gym might be closed by the time I could get there. I'll have to find some other way to get my exercise." 

 The invitation offered and then accepted was the signal for the other two to say they needed to get going and they got up and left. She asked Toby where his place was and when he told her she realized that it was forty minutes away. 

 "I need to be home in an hour and a half so your place is out." 

 "All I can offer is a motel then." 

 "The nearest motel is twenty minutes away and then I'd have to come back another twenty minutes this way. That's a tremendous waste of time." 

 "How do you feel about back seats?" 

 "I don't know. I've never done it there." 

 "A new experience for you then. Shall we?" 

 He stood up and offered her his hand and they had headed for the parking lot. They had gotten in his car and he had driven to the back of the parking lot and parked in the darkest corner and they had gotten in the back and done it. Twice! She had cum five times while on her back with her legs up on his shoulders looking up at him and the headliner of his car. She had even sucked his cock to get him hard to do her the second time. The episode had excited the hell out of her. The only thing that could have made it a bigger turn on would have been to look up and see someone looking into the car and watching. 

 She made a date with Toby for Friday. They would meet at his apartment when she got off work. She really didn't know how she felt about that. A bed would be nice, but the feeling she had on that back seat...wow! 

 It was five minutes to ten when he heard the motor to the garage door opener start run. He had spent hours working on what he would say and how he would say it, but the gist of it was, "Let's put this behind us and see if we can't put things back together again." He knew that it wouldn't be easy to get back to the way they were and in fact they might never get back all the way there, but if they both worked at it they might get close. 

 The connecting door from the garage into the kitchen and opened and then closed and a minute later Shawna walked into the family room. One look at her and all the words he had practiced were gone; chased away by the way she looked. She had that "just fucked' look that he was so familiar with and it was reinforced by the mis-buttoned blouse and the ladders and runs in her stockings. 

 He shook his head in disgust and then, with out a word to her, he got up and headed for his room. As he undressed he was glad he hadn't called Carol and cancelled. 

 She saw him look at her and she knew what he saw and she knew what the look he gave her meant and it broke her heart, but as much as she loved him she was not, as she had told him, going to live the life of a nun in a convent. She had needs and if he wasn't going to take care of them she would find someone who would. Someone like Toby. 

 ++++++++++++ 

 The next morning he was waiting for her when she came down to the kitchen. As soon as she got her coffee and sat down he said: 

 "We need to work out a schedule. Someone needs to be here with the girls and while I love them dearly I'm not going to be the one who stays home every night while you go out and fuck. I propose that one of us take Monday and Thursdays and the other Tuesday and Friday. We can alternate Saturdays and Wednesday and Sunday we both stay home and spend time with the girls; time when we can act like a family." 

 "In the first place don't you dare take that tone of voice with me. I wouldn't go out and fuck, as you so charmingly put it, if I was getting it at home where I should be getting it. You have no one to blame but yourself if I go out. That said, I think your plan is a good one. I'll take Tuesday and Friday. The only amendment I'd want to make to your plan is that whenever one of the girls has an event that parents should attend and it falls on one of the nights on yours or my schedule we have to give up our night out and spend it with the girls." 

 "I agree." 

 He looked at his watch and then got up to get ready for work. He turned just before he left the room and said: 

 "Just for the record. I'm not to blame for anything here. You are the one who spent sixteen hours in bed with another man. Not just a one time drunken indiscretion that you got up and ran from as soon as it was over, but an all night and all the next morning fuck fest. So don't give me any shit about the fact that you aren't getting taken care of at home so it is my fault that you are going out whoring." 

 He left the kitchen and so he wasn't there when she started crying. 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

That night he had dinner at Carol's and then they rolled around on her bed until it was time for him to leave. Carol was an insatiable little slut and she kept getting him up to go one more time. She loved it all. She especially loved oral and she told him that she even liked anal but that would have to wait until another night because she was all out of Astroglide. 

 Over dinner he had told her about his schedule and she asked if he planned on spending those days with her and he told her that they were hers if she wanted them. 

 "I want them as long as you know that it isn't going to lead to anything serious. I can do a long term Georgie, but I can't do a live in. I just can not live with anyone else. A couple of weeks, maybe a month, but any longer than that and the other person will get on my nerves." 

 "It works out well then because I have to stay at home at least until my daughters start college." 

 Toby was a little less than overjoyed when she told him that she would be able to see him every Tuesday and Friday and every other Saturday and she picked up on it right away. 

 "You don't seem to be pleased at the news." 

 "Yeah, well, it's like this. Tuesdays I bowl in the men's house league at Bowl- O-Rama and every other Friday is poker night with my buddies. The every other Saturday is okay and every other Friday will work for me too." 

 "Maybe it will work for you, but it certainly won't work for me." 

 "Does that mean that we aren't going to do anything tonight?" 

 "Don't be silly. We are here so we won't waste it. I'll arm wrestle my husband to be the first one to start the Saturday rotation and that will give us tomorrow also. After that? I guess I'll have to start looking for a new playmate to have my fun with." 

 As she dropped her bra on the floor and stepped out of her panties she was thinking of the blow that Toby had just given her ego. She was number three - third on the list of priorities, right behind bowling and a card game. 

 George didn't quibble when she told him she would like to take the first Saturday in the rotation and she spent from two in the afternoon until one in the morning with Toby. She was able to get back at him a little for letting her know how unimportant she was in the grand scheme of his life. He wanted to try anal sex with her and she refused him out of spite. 

 Tuesday found her stopping with the people from work again. As on the last night she stopped she had nursed one glass of white wine and then switched to soda water. She had danced with several of the guys she worked with and about a half an hour into the evening she was dancing with Melvin Page who worked in Shipping and Receiving. At one point he pulled her in close and she felt his erection poking her in the leg. 

 "Shame on you Mel; you are supposed to be a happily married man." 

 "I'm not." 

 "Not what?" 

 "Not happily married. Trudy ran off with a guy she works with. I haven't seen her or heard from her in four months." 

 "You think she'll come back?" 

 "Doesn't matter if she does or not. I filed for divorce last week and if she does come back all she'll get from me is the papers when I have her served." 

 "So you haven't had any bedroom fun for four months?" 

 "Unfortunately, no." 

 "Poor baby. I wish I could help you out, but I'm afraid of affairs in the work place. The last thing I need is to be branded a slut by my co-workers." 

 "Why would they know?" 

 "They would see it." 

 "No they wouldn't. We behave as we always have toward each other here and at work. We would get together at my place or your place after work." 

 "Not my place. My husband wouldn't care for that at all." 

 "No sense of humor?" 

 "None at all." 

 "How about this then. I'll leave and drive down the street to the Safeway parking lot. You wait ten minutes and then you leave and you can follow me to my house." 

 "You sure that no one will ever know?" 

 "Not from me." 

 Half an hour later she was on her back with her legs up on Mel's shoulders and urging him to push his cock in deeper. He gave her several orgasms before he came and then she sucked his cock to get him hard again and then thinking of her last time with Toby she got on her knees and said: 

 "I want you in my ass this time." 

 As Mel eased himself into her butt she thought of the many times George had asked for it and how she had always turned him down. The Glen took her ass and she found that she liked it and she had so looked forward to saying yes to George the next time he asked, but now that time would never happen. She moaned as Mel slid his length into her and then she pushed back at him. 

 "Fuck my ass lover, fuck my ass."

 It was summer time and the girls were out of school. Shawna's parents wanted to take them for a week and so arrangements were made and on his Monday out Shawna drove the girls over to her parent's house and dropped them off. He had been spending his Mondays and Thursdays and every other Saturday with Carol for a little over two months and that night as they were resting following a rather strenuous session he asked: 

 "How would you like to spend a long weekend with me?" 

 "How can you do that?" 

 "Shawna's parents took the kids for a week so we could have from Friday evening until Sunday night. If you would like I could also take a vacation day and that would give us until at least ten on Monday night." 

 "I've got some time off coming so I could take Monday off also; let's do it!" 

 "Consider it done." 

 Friday night they had dinner and then went dancing following which they spent their first full night together. At first it felt strange to wake up with a mouth on his cock - something that hadn't happened in almost nine months. After a morning romp they drove out to Lake Monroe and spent a day at the beach. When they got home they climbed into bed and had some extremely satisfying sex. She had just taken off her bikini and she had looked so sexy that he had pushed her back on the bed and went down on her. He ate her to an orgasm and then he had pulled her legs up onto his shoulders and had fucked her through two more climaxes and then they had dressed and gone to dinner. 

 They were sitting at a table at Augustino's, sipping the house red and waiting for their entrée when suddenly he said: 

 "Oh fuck me!" 

 "What's wrong?" Carol asked. 

 ++++++++++ 

 It had been a damned near perfect day. With the girls gone for the week she had planned out a full weekend with Mel. She and Mel had gone to the zoo and then had eaten a picnic lunch following which they went to the museum of Natural History. 

 As soon as they got back to Mel's house they had a hot, sweaty and very satisfying love making session. They had showered together which led to another hot fuck session and then another shower. Having worked up an appetite they decided to go out for dinner. 

 The hostess was walking them to a table when suddenly she exclaimed, "Oh shit!" 

 

 "What's wrong?" Mel asked. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 My wife and some guy just came in and hostess is leading them this way." 

 Carol looked over her shoulder and then looked back at him and asked, "Did she know you were going to be here tonight?" 

 

 

 "I didn't even know we were going to be here until we left your apartment." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Pray that they don't get seated at the empty table next to us and then ignore them until we finish our meal and can leave." 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 "My husband is sitting at a table with some woman and the hostess is leading us straight to them." 

 "Maybe we should just leave and find another restaurant." 

 "No. He has seen us and it would look like I was tucking my tail between my legs and running. If the hostess seats us too close to them we will just tell her we don't like the table and ask to be seated some place else and then we will do our best to ignore them until after we eat and can leave. 

 +++++++++++++ 

 Shawna did not look his way as she and the man she was with walked by. Once by him his back was to her so he was at least spared having her sitting at a table where he would have to look at her. But even though he couldn't see her just knowing that she was there made him uncomfortable. 

 He and Carol ate their meal and when they were done with main course they passed on dessert and after dinner drinks and got up and left. 

 "Well," Carol said as they walked toward the parking lot, "That certainly put a damper on the evening." 

 "Nonsense baby, just a bump in the road. A few drinks and some dancing will lighten the mood and a week from now we will have something to look back at and have a laugh. Where would you like to go?" 

 "How about the Blue Room? I hear they have a great band there." 

 "The Blue Room it is" he said as he opened the car door for her." 

 ++++++++++++ 

 She was sitting with her back to George and even though she couldn't see him just knowing that he was there made her uneasy. Knowing how George felt about her she wouldn't put it past him to walk up to her table and make some nasty comment. She wished she had gone along with Mel when he suggested that they turn around and leave. 

 They were half way through their meal when Mel said, "You can relax now. They just got up and left." 

 She felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from her shoulders. "Sorry" she said, "I wanted this to be a fun weekend for us." 

 "It isn't over yet. We still have the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow. There is still plenty we can do to have a good time. 

 ++++++++++++ 

 They were dancing a nice, slow waltz and Carol felt good in his arms. His cock was rubbing against her leg and she was giggling and saying, "Promises, promises" when he felt a tap on his shoulder and a voice said: 

 "May I cut in?" 

 He turned and saw the man who had been with Shawna at the restaurant. 

 "The lady in the booth against the far wall would like a word with you" and he pointed to a booth where Shawna was sitting. 

 He was all set to tell the man to go back and tell Shawna that he wasn't interested in talking to her when Carol said, "Go ahead sweetie; I'll be all right." 

 He hesitated just a moment and then stepped away from Carol and walked over to where Shawna was sitting. He slid into the booth across from her and asked: 

 "What is it Shawna?" 

 "Do you believe in fate George?" 

 "Other than knowing that I have to die and pay taxes I can't say that I do. Why?" 

 "I believe that some things happen for a reason. Not all things, but some things." 

 "What is this all about Shawna?" 

 "George, in all the years that we have been married we never been inside of Augustino's. In sixteen years we never once came here to the Blue Room. And yet tonight we both ended up at both places. To me that is fate telling me that I'm supposed to be where you are. I've told you that I love you George; I've told you until I'm blue in the face, but what has happened tonight has convinced me that fate expects me to do whatever I have to do to get you back in my life. 

 "What is it going to take George? I mean besides the obvious. The not being a nun thing is history. It doesn't matter if I have needs or not. Tonight has shown me that I'm supposed to be yours and no one else's. To me that means take care of you, our home and our kids and to sew my pussy shut if I have to. When I leave here George I'm going straight home. I'll do nothing from now on except work hard to get you back. I'm serious George - I'll do whatever it takes. 

 "Right now all I'm asking is that you at least consider that our paths crossing tonight might mean something." 

 She looked away for a second and then back at him. "I don't mean to ruin your evening George; you had better get back to your date." 

 "What about yours?" 

 "He will drive me to my car and then he is history." 

 "Does he know that?" 

 "Not yet, but he is a really nice guy and he will be okay with it." 

 He sat there and looked at her for several seconds and then he got up and headed back to his table. The band had finished their set and were taking a break so Shawna's date and Carol were sitting at the table when he joined them. Shawna's date stood up and excused himself and headed back to Shawna and Carol asked: 

 "What was that all about?" 

 "She wanted to know if I believed in fate" and then he told her what Shawna had said to him. 

 "Do you?" 

 "Do I what?" 

 "Believe in fate?" 

 "Like I told her, my fate is to pay taxes and die, other than that I don't know." 

 "So what are you going to do?" 

 "About what?" 

 "About her going home and dedicating herself to getting you back." 

 "I don't think there is much chance of that. Too many bridges burned." 

 "Well, if there is any chance at all it will have to wait until next week. You promised me this week end and I'm holding you to it." 

 Their love making for the rest of the weekend and right up until six o'clock Monday evening was intense and exhausting. It was almost as if Carol thought it would be the last time that they would be together and she wanted all she could get before he left. She pretty much confirmed that that is what she was thinking when he got ready to leave. 

 "Am I going to see you again? Outside of work I mean?" 

 "Of course you will. What kind of question is that?" 

 "Honey, you are not a hard person to read. I was naturally curious so I was watching while you were talking to your wife. About halfway through the conversation I saw what I believe was a look of hope cross your face." 

 "Hope? Why would there have been a look of hope?" 

 "You love her you big jerk. You once told me that you had gotten right to the edge of trying to work it out and put things back together between the two of you, but before you could she gave up waiting and trying to get you back. That's when you hooked up with me." 

 "What does that have to do with hope?" 

 "It means that you can no longer throw stones. You are married to her but you have been spending your time in my bed. If she does what she says and stays home from now on there is a chance you can sit down and talk and maybe work things out. There won't be any of that, "but you screwed other guys" because her response would be, "And I'm supposed to believe you only play cards with that little blond?" No honey, all you have to do is get by that first time and you were at that point once already." 

 "You sound like you are trying to push me out the door." 

 "Oh come on sweetie; you and I both know that we were never going to be permanent. We might have been good for another six months or so, but we are destined to end sooner or later. I'm in no hurry to end it - I like having you around - but I am a realist." 

 He knew Carol was right about their affair not having the legs for the long haul and he said, "So you are telling me that I need to walk away?" 

 "No I'm not, but I am saying that I like you enough to hope that you can get back to your happy home life. If not, I'll still be here and I would be happy to have several more months to look forward to." 

 ++++++++ 

 Shawna was just getting home from work when he got home. He pulled in and parked behind her and when she got out of her car she gave me a smile and then headed into the house. On his drive home he thought about what Carol had said. He did love Shawna - he had never denied that - but the problem hadn't changed. It was still that first time and the fact that she had stayed until noon the next day. Getting by Shawna's being taken advantage of while under the influence would have been hard, but he could have done it, but how in God's name was he supposed to get past what had followed. True, he had almost reached the point were he was willing to sit down and talk about it and was on the ragged edge of maybe - just maybe- trying to work something out, but then Shawna had gone out and gotten herself laid and that had killed any thoughts he may have had of trying to work anything out. 

 The question was could he get himself back to the point where he was willing to sit down with Shawna and try. Was Carol right? Did his affair with her balance out what Shawna had done? He had suddenly realized that no, it didn't. The time spent with Carol balanced out what Shawna had done since her "cloistered nun" statement and maybe even the first coupling on the night of the drunken indiscretion, but it did not balance out the night and the next morning following the first time. He did not believe that he could ever balance that part out. So the next question was could he forgive and move on. He would never forget and it would always be the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore, but could he at least forgive? 

 +++++++++ 

 For the next month things were normal around the house. That is to say that things were like they had been for the six months between Shawna's confession and her going out and getting laid. The only difference was that Shawna didn't try to get him to do anything - she just did everything that she had done for those six months and waited. Waited and hoped. 

 He still spent his two nights a week and every other Saturday with Carol and he could see the hurt in Shawna's eyes when he came home from being with his lover. That hurt gave him some small satisfaction. At least Shawna was feeling some of the pain that he felt. He knew that it was petty of him to be that way, but he still felt that he was owed. 

 He came to realize that the farther they got away from "that night" the less it hurt and while he knew it would never go away he had at least gotten to the point that he could think about it and not get all twisted up inside. He also knew that the key to ever having a relationship with Shawna was to find out why that night had turned out the way it had. Why had Shawna stayed? 

 It was a Thursday night and he had just come home from a strenuous evening in Carol's bed. Normally everyone would be in bed by the time he got home, but he found Shawna still awake and sitting in the kitchen. She was nursing a glass of white wine and it was obvious that she had been crying. He had the urge to take her in his arms and comfort her, but he didn't. Instead he got a beer from the fridge and sat down across from her. The two of them sat in silence for a couple of minutes and then Shawna said: 

 "I don't know if I'm strong enough for this George. I don't know if I can continue on with this helpless feeling that I have. I love you George and I desperately want you, but I don't know what to do. I don't see any sign at all that you are ever going to care. Maybe the best thing to do is end this farce and set us both free. The girls are old enough to cope with it and with shared custody we would both still be in their lives." 

 "No. No divorce. Not until the girls have moved out and are on their own." 

 "I don't think I can hold on that long George. I'll keep my promise. I'll keep my legs closed, but I don't know how long I can go on living in the same house with you knowing that I can never have you. I just don't know what to do." 

 "You do know what to do Shawna. You know what caused our problem and you need to deal with it." 

 "What do you mean George?" 

 "Just what I said. You know what the problem is and you have to deal with it. The real problem isn't that you let yourself be taken advantage of; the real problem is what came after. I'll admit to being part of the problem - I did tell you to go ahead and party and that I would be there to be the designated driver - but I take no responsibility for what continued on until noon of the next day. You were out of it the first time, but no way were you still out of all night and all the next morning. That's the big ugly toad sitting on the table and staring at us. Not the one time Shawna, but all the other times after the first one." 

 He got up, said "Good night" and went on up to bed. He was lying there staring up at the ceiling when the door opened and Shawna came in. She didn't turn on the light, just shut the door behind her and walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. He heard her take a deep breath and then she said:  

 

 

===

"I can't make it go away George. I wish I could, but I can't. All I can do is tell you why it happened - why I let it happen. After Glen fucked me that first time I was laying there on the bed crying and he said, "Shut up and stop your whining. You liked it and you know it. Now suck my dick and get me hard again." When I didn't to do it he grabbed my head and forced himself into my mouth. He held my head and fucked my face until he was hard and then he took me again. 

 "He didn't care about how much I protested, he just took what he wanted. I was there for his pleasure; he wasn't there for mine. All I was to him was a piece of meat - a hot hole he could shove his cock into. Halfway into it my body started to respond and I had an orgasm. The second time took him a while and by the time he was ready to cum I was right on the edge of an orgasm when he came and started to pull out and I cried for him not to stop, to keep going and get me off. He laughed and pulled out and told me that if I needed to get off I'd better hurry up and get him hard again and he shoved his cock in my mouth and face fucked me again. 

 "I found out something about myself that night George, something that I never knew about myself. Under the right set of circumstances I have a touch of the submissive in me and Glen found that button and was pushing it. He didn't give a crap about me, only about taking what he wanted. For some reason that I don't understand that excited me George. He took - all he did was take - and it turned me on. He saw it and he used it and the more he forced me to do what he wanted the more turned on I got. I had more orgasms that night than at any other time in my life. 

 "I wasn't thinking of right or wrong George; I didn't think of you or the girls, just about the next orgasm. When Glen couldn't get it up any more I was exhausted and I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning thinking that it was you sucking on my breasts and when I opened my eyes I saw that it was Glen. You know how sensitive my breasts are George and his working on them had me on the ragged edge of another orgasm and he mounted me and then it was more of the previous evening. He kept giving me orgasms and I kept trying for more of them. He told me to suck his cock and I did. He fucked me and then told me to clean off his cock and I did. He told me to get on my knees and pull my ass cheeks apart for him and I did. I did whatever he told me to do George because for some reason that only God knows it was exciting the hell out of me and turning me on. 

 "He kept on taking and taking George and I kept on cumming and cumming. He used me George and he made me like it. I don't understand it George; to this day I do not understand it. If you had treated me that way I would tied you to the bed, beat you with a cast iron frying pan and then have packed a bag and been gone in a heart beat. 

 "Anyway, I left that motel room knowing that it would never happen again. It was over and done with and you would never know. And you never would have if I hadn't had such a crushing sense of guilt and confessed all. I'm sorry George. I didn't plan on it, I didn't mean to do it and I wasn't strong enough - physically, mentally or emotionally - to stop it once it was happening. I love you George, much more than you realize, and it is tearing me apart that one drunken night and what I let happen has ruined it for the two of us." 

 She got up and left the room leaving him even more unsettled than he had been. He pushed her around, bossed her took her and she liked it? How could she be submissive and he not know it or at least suspect it? As long as they had been together and he hadn't a clue. But then would he have even noticed if there had been a clue? He wasn't the kind of man who would be into something like that. To him making love was a cooperative activity with both sides giving pleasure to each other and not caring about the other person was an idea that was totally alien to him. 

 And Shawna said that she had liked it! She had liked it well enough to stay. 

 Well, he had told Shawna that she needed to deal with the ugly told and she had and it was what he had been telling himself that he had to know, but was he better off knowing? Did it make any difference? 

 ++++++++++++ 

 He was up and out of the house before Shawna and the girls woke up. He had the Grand Slam at Denny's for breakfast and then headed into his office. He had a full in-basket and it took him until lunch time to clear it. He was so busy that he didn't have time to think about Shawna and what she had told him, but once his desk was cleared the thoughts came crowding in. 

 Almost as if there was mental telepathy involved the phone rang and it was Shawna. 

 "You are on your own as far as dinner is concerned. Your mom wants to keep the girls for a couple of days and so I'll be running them over to her place when I get off work and I'll be late getting home." 

 Late getting home? His parents only lived twenty-five minutes away. No reason for her not to be home by seven. Where was she going after leaving his parent's that would keep her out late? That thought triggered other thoughts which spent the afternoon inside his head. 

 When he got home he grabbed a beer out of the fridge and nursed it while thinking about his situation. He thought about what Shawna had done the night of the cocktail party and what she had done since. He thought about her initial confession and he thought about her explanation of why she had done what she had done. He thought about Marie's advice to take a lover and balance the scales and he thought about how that had turned out. He thought about Carol and what she said she had seen on his face when he had talked with Shawna at the Blue Room and how Shawna was so sure that fate meant for them to be together. He kept coming back to the idea of his time with Carol cancelling out what Shawna had done, but had it? If it hadn't, what would? 

 He was sitting in the living room working on his sixth, seventh or eighth beer - he didn't know which - when he heard the garage door opener start to run. He glanced at his watch and saw that it was ten after ten. Shawna came into the room and he looked up at her. She looked at him and said: 

 "What? Why are you looking at me like that?" 

 She was wearing a short skirt, high heels and a blouse that showed some cleavage. Just the kind of outfit that a woman would wear if she was out trying to find a guy and get laid. It was obvious to him what she had done after she had dropped off the kids at his parents AND she had promised to keep her legs closed! 

 "You bitch!" he snarled at her and he grabbed her by the arm and drug her behind the couch and bent her over the back of it. With her bent over and his hand pushing down in the middle of her back her feet couldn't touch the floor and she couldn't get any leverage to break loose. All she could do was cry out. 

 "What are you doing George? Stop it. Stop it right now!" 

 She struggled and cried and he ignored her. "Like to be taken, do you" he snarled. "Like to be forced? Like to be made to do things?" As he talked he used his free hand to push her panties aside and unzip himself. "He just took you and made you like it right? Isn't that what you told me? He used you and made you like it? Well that's just what I doing you fucking whore - using you!" and he used his knees to spread her legs. He probed with his cock until he found the crease and then he pushed. 

 "No George, no! I don't want this George, stop it!" 

 "Of course you want it you bitch! You like being taken; you like being used, you said so yourself. Or is it you only like being taken and used by other men. Is that it Shawna?" he said as he rammed his cock into her. "You don't mind being used as long as it isn't by me, is that what you are saying? Well fuck you you whore. I'm going to be just like your fucking lover and just take." 

 She was howling in protest as he held her hips with both hands and pounded in to her. She was moaning "No, no, not like this. Stop it George, stop it." 

 "Fuck you" he snapped and kept plunging his cock into her. Her cries and pleas stopped, but she still moaned and he didn't know if she was moaning because she was starting to get something out of it or because of the discomfort and frankly he didn't care. He was looking down at her as he banged away at her cunt and he remembered something that she had told him when she had initially confessed. It triggered even more anger in him. He shoved his left thumb into her asshole and she cried out: 

 "No damn you, no!" 

 He ignored her and worked his thumb around while she protested and told him to stop. He pulled his thumb out and replaced it with two fingers and as he worked them she was moaning: 

 "No George, no. God damn it George no! Not like this George, not like this." 

 He laughed and said, "Not bloody likely you fucking slut. Sixteen years married and not once did you ever let me have your ass. "Oh no George, that's just plain dirty." Remember telling me that? How about "That's disgusting George; I can't believe you even asked." What about "Forget it George, it will never happen." Remember that bitch? Remember telling me that it would never happen?" 

 He pulled his cock out of her cunt and placed the head of his cock at her asshole and pressed forward a little. "It will never happen is what you told me right? But it did happen didn't it? Remember what you told me about what you and your lover did on the night of the cocktail party? You said, "He told me that he wanted my ass and so I got on my knees and gave it to him." No argument with him, but for me it was "Forget it George." Well I'm not forgetting anymore" and he pushed his cock hard at her asshole. It resisted and then the head of his cock popped past the sphincter and he started pushing his cock into her. She yelled, hollered and screamed, but he ignored her and just kept fucking her. 

 He had been fucking her ass for almost five minutes and he was ready to get his nuts off and he debated on whether or not to cum in her ass or be really nasty and go straight from her ass to her cunt. He decided to go in her ass. He didn't feel bad over this grudge fuck - God knows she had it coming - but he knew he would feel bad if he went from one hole to the other and she got sick because of it. 

 "Here it comes you fucking slut" and he pumped his balls empty as squirt after squirt of his cum went roaring deep into Shawna's ass. He pulled his cock out of her butt hole and stepped back and Shawna surprised him. She cried out: 

 "No George, no. You can't stop now. I'm close. Get me off George, get me off." 

 He had no idea that she was getting anything out of it. With all of the yelling, moaning, groaning and cries to stop he never would have guessed. He laughed at her and said: 

 "If you need to get off go on back out and let the asshole you were with earlier tonight finish you off" and he walked away from her. 

 When he came out of the shower and went to his room he found her sitting on his bed. She looked up at him when he walked into the room and said: 

 "Why George? Why did you treat me that way?" 

 "Isn't that what you told me you liked? To be taken and used? Oh wait, I seem to have forgotten part of it. To be taken and used and to be made to like it. Didn't I make you like it Shawna? Or is it only other men who can do that?" 

 "I don't like it George, not one bit. Yes, given the circumstances I did like it that one evening, but only that night and even then I don't know why, but only that night and that time and place. I never let Mel treat me like that and I certainly expected better from you. What you just did was mean George, dirty and mean." 

 "Yeah? Well maybe dirty and mean are what I needed to get rid of some of the anger and rage I've carried around since you have become everybody's slut." 

 "I'm not everybody's slut George. There have only been three. Glen, a guy I met at the bar and had a short fling with and Mel. Why tonight George? Why haven't you taken your anger out on me before?" 

 "It happened tonight because you pushed me over the edge. You promised me you were going to keep your legs closed from now on, but you couldn't do it could you. I believed you and I had almost talked myself into sitting down and trying to work something out with you, but you couldn't keep from spreading your legs could you? Who was it tonight? Glen or Mel, not that I really give a shit anymore." 

 "You think I've been out with a man tonight?" 

 "You going to deny it? You should have been home by seven. Even if you had driven fifteen mile below the speed limit you should still have been home by seven. You come in her three hours later dressed in an outfit designed to grab male attention and you think I'm not bright enough to figure it out?" 

 She stared at him for several seconds and then said, "I guess you aren't too bright at that George. In the first place I always like to look my best when I go out. I've got great legs and I look good in a short skirt and heels and if it grabs male attention it is great for my ego. Secondly, I wasn't out with a man tonight. When I talked to your sister today and told her that your parents were taking the kids for a couple of days she asked me to have dinner with her. And yes George, we did attract a lot of male attention and I ate it up." 

 "Marie was your alibi the night you came home and told me I was sticking my cock in another man's cum. Maybe I need to take a closer look at Marie." 

 "Well in that case George, you had better take a close look at your mother too. She decided to join us for a girl's night out while your dad watched the girls. I didn't mention having dinner with Marie because frankly George, you haven't seemed to care one whit about where I go or what I do." 

 He stared at her fro a couple of seconds, shrugged and said, "Well, there you have it." 

 "Have what George?" 

 "The reason we can never put or marriage back together. When something like tonight happens I don't trust you enough to not think the worst." 

 "Bullshit George! If you were talking to me you would have known where I was going to be and who I was going to be with. I made you a promise and I will keep it. If necessary I will give you a printed schedule of where I will be, what I will be doing and with whom, complete with phone numbers so you can check up on me whenever you feel the need. Put me back in your life George. Get us back to where we communicate with each other. I know I screwed up George and I regret it. I have regretted it every day since it happened. 

 "I won't lie to you George; something strange happened to me that night and I did like it, but I still hate it that it happened. All I can say in my defense George is that I didn't set out to do it, I didn't want it to happen, but it did and I am going to live with the shame of it for the rest of my life. You are the only man I want in my life George; you were the only man in my life for over sixteen years and I wish to God it was still that way. I need you George; can't you see that? I need you back in my life so bad that I'm even willing to share George. Keep seeing your girlfriend if you have to, but let me come back to you George; let me back in your bed." 

 I sat there listening to her and feeling ashamed of myself for having used her like I had. I should have known that there was a legitimate reason for her being out. She had promised me that there would be no more men in her life and as far as I knew Shana had never lied to me. She had confessed what had happened at the cocktail party and she didn't have to. She could have kept silent and I would have never known and none of the last year would have happened. And when she had confessed she hadn't held back even when it would have been better if she would have. She didn't hide it from me when she took up with another man and in fact she had told me that she was going to do it if I didn't take care of her myself. 

 She sat there looking at me and waiting for me to say something, but what was I going to say? I damned sure wasn't going to be "I'm sorry" even though I was. I wasn't the kind of man who did what I had just done and it bothered me that I had done it, but to say I was sorry? Not after the hell that her actions had put me through. Finally I said: 

 "I'm tired Shawna. I have to get up early tomorrow and I need to get to bed." 

 She gave me a long look and then got up and left the room. I had a hard time sleeping that night. 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 She couldn't believe that she had said it. She had actually told George that she wouldn't care if he kept his blond bimbo big titted girlfriend as long as he started sleeping with her too. Was she that desperate to have him back? She knew the answer to that one -- yes! But what if he decided to do it. Could she really handle it? 

 

 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

Share George with his girl friend? Good Lord why had she blurted that out. Could she share him like she told him she would? She didn't really have an answer for that one and the way George had acted after she had blurted it out led her to believe that she would never have to find out. Her begging to be a part of his life again hadn't seemed to faze him at all. Just "I want to go to bed, please leave." 

 She was at a loss as to what to do to get George back. She needed his love, his tenderness; she needed him to want her sexually even if it had to be the way he had just done it. She hadn't liked the way he had taken her and in fact, when she finally told him about the rest of her night with Glen at the party she had told him that if he had ever treated her like that she would be gone in a heartbeat. Well, he had treated her that way and she wasn't packing her suitcases. She had not liked it one bit, well that wasn't exactly true - she had gotten into it when he took her ass - and she hoped that he would never be that way with her again, but if he did she knew that she would somehow suffer through it in the hope that somehow it would help heal the marriage. She needed sex even if it was bad sex. 

 Giving up Mel had been hard on her, but she really believed that fate meant for her to be with George and she did not regret making her promise to George. It wasn't going to be easy - temptation was everywhere - but she was determined to somehow get George back and it would never happen as long as she was letting someone else scratch her itch. 

 She thought back to the night she and Mel had shown up at every place that George and his date went. She remembered how Mel had taken it when she had said that it was over between them. 

 "You don't mean now do you? You mean after our weekend right?" 

 "No Mel, I mean now. I'm going home and I'm going to wait for George to come back to me no matter how long it takes." 

 "You can't do this to me baby. All night long you have been rubbing my cock and promising that you were going to fuck my brains out. I'm as hard as an iron bar" and he had taken her hand and placed it on his cock and she had rubbed it once before jerking her hand away. 

 "I'm sorry Mel, but I can't help you. All the signs say I have to be with George and I promised him that I was going to go straight home from here and then not have sex with anyone but him ever again." 

 "Come on baby; you can leave me hanging like this." 

 She had looked at Mel and she actually felt his pain. For him it was like it had been for her for the six months she had tried to get George interested in her again. She had glanced at the door to the Blue Room and then she had made up her mind. She knew she was splitting hairs, but she couldn't - just couldn't leave Mel to suffer. 

 "I said that I was going to go straight home from here and then never have sex with anyone else. Technically as long as I'm still in the parking lot I'm still here and I said that once I got home there would be no other men for me. I guess if I stretch the point it means I can fuck you as long as we stay here in the parking lot. I'll do it one time to get rid of your swelling, but then I'm going home. Agreed?" 

 "Anything you say baby, just get me off." 

 They had gotten in his car and moved to a dark corner of the lot and had gotten in the back seat. She had only intended to get him off and then go, but the excitement that she had felt when she had fucked Toby on his back seat grabbed her again and she had fucked Mel, sucked him hard and then had fucked him again and all the time hoping to look up and see someone watching. 

 When Mel had cum the second time he wanted her to suck him hard again, but she pushed him away and told him to drive her to her car. She had thanked him for the wonderful times he had given her and then she had kissed him, gotten in her car and had driven home. As she drove she thought about her last time with Mel and was glad she had rationalized it the way she did. That would be the last sex she would have until she either got George back or gave up. 

 She had made George a promise and she would keep it, but she was a realist. She knew that she couldn't go without forever and if she and George couldn't put it their marriage back together back together she would need to get her sex somewhere else. To do that she would have to void the promise and the only way she could do that was divorce. The question was how long could she hold out.

 The next evening, after he and Carol had made love, he told Carol about what Shawna had said about sharing him. 

 "And what did you say?" 

 "I didn't say anything." 

 "She has to love you a lot and want you pretty bad to go that far. She is crawling baby; the only thing she hasn't done is lick your feet. When are you going to admit to yourself that you love her and forgive her? She fucked up! So what? Everyone makes mistakes and bad errors of judgment and does stupid shit that they regret later. I'll grant you that her's was a whopper, but she was honest and up front about it. She could have kept her mouth shut and the odds are pretty damned good that you would have never known. If it had happened to me God knows that I would never have told on myself. I would have buried it so deep that even I would have forgotten about it and then done my level best to love my hubby to death for the rest of my life. 

 "That sounds like what she was doing Georgie; doing her absolute best to love you to death only you wouldn't let her. I'm not trying to get rid of you baby because I do like you a lot and I love the arrangement we have, but you do belong with her and you know it. Your pride, ego or whatever is all that is keeping the two of you apart. Some other guy got something that was supposed to be yours and yours alone and it got you all bent out of shape. 

 "You know that she didn't mean for it to happen and you can't understand how she let it go so far, but you know in your heart that she would never have done it again or let it happen again. You have to know that Georgie. She showed you that when she blew the whistle on herself. She is not the kind who can carry the guilt." 

 "What about the others?" 

 "What about them? 

 "She didn't have any problem going with them." 

 "True, but she didn't sneak around did she? She was up front about it. If you weren't going to take care of her she was going to get someone who would and she told you before she did it so there was no guilt to carry. She was probably sorry that it had to end up that way and sad that it had to be that way, but I'm on her side there George. Sex is a physical need and in her place I'm pretty damned sure that I wouldn't have waited near as long to see that I got what I needed." 

 She had started fondling his cock and it responded. As she swung over him she said: 

 "If she is willing to share lover, I'll go along with the program" and then she lowered herself down onto him."

 Driving home that night he thought about what Shawna had said and about what Carol had said. Both of them were willing to share him and he found that amazing. But as amazing as it was it was never going to happen. He just wasn't wired that way. It would be one or the other, but it would never be both. But which one? Even as he asked the question he knew the answer. At least he knew which one he wanted it to be. If he could make it happen. That was going to be the hard part - making it happen. 

 Even though he was ashamed of himself for what he had done to Shawna the night before what he had done had been beneficial. He hadn't realized how much he had kept bottled up inside after Shawna's confession. It had all come out of him as he took her and used her and yes, abused her. It was as if he had burned the bad shit out of himself and with the bad stuff gone he could look at things and see them in a different light. 

 Shawna was not the type of woman who would do what she had done, but type or not she had done it and suddenly he could see how it could have happened. She got caught up in it. Isn't that what had happened to him? He wasn't the kind of man who could force himself on a woman and treat her like nothing but a piece of meat, but isn't that what he did? He let his anger take hold of him and it pushed him to do something he ordinarily would never even think of doing. He let himself get caught up in the moment. His moment had been anger driven while Shawna's moment had been driven by sexual excitement. Different yes, but were not they really the same? A time when the rest of you took time off and let some dark part of you take over for a while? Shawna had felt a crushing guilt at letting her dark part run free and he was ashamed for letting his dark part out of its cage. Not the same thing, but close enough to understand. At least that is what he was thinking, but the question was could he make himself accept it? 

 And there were other questions. It was a given that even if he and Shawna managed to put things back together the nature of the relationship would be vastly different than the one they had before. Would they even like that relationship or was it doomed before it even started? Another question, and one that was really bothering him, was did Shawna really want them back together or was it her guilt at work telling her that the only way she could be at peace with what she had done would be to save her marriage? He didn't have a clue as to what the answers to those questions might be, but he needed to find out.

 She was sitting in bed reading "Hidden Prey," John Sanford's latest, when she heard him come in. She glanced at the bedside clock and saw that it was close to eleven. He must have been with his slut again. Didn't he realize how much it hurt her when he was with that big titted bimbo? Stupid question girl, she thought, of course he realized it. That was why he did it - to get back at her for what she had done. 

 She heard him come up the stairs and then down the hallway. She was surprised when his footsteps stopped at the door to her room instead of continuing down the hall to the spare bedroom. And even more surprised when he knocked on the door. "Yes?" she called out and the door opened and George came into the room. 

 "Yes George?" 

 "I have a question for you. You said you would be willing to share me with Carol. Did you really mean that or was it something you just said in the hopes of swaying me?" 

 She looked at hi standing there waiting for her answer. She had meant it. The idea was repugnant to her and she couldn't think of anything more distasteful, but if it was the price she had to pay she would do it and smile. 

 "Have you just come from her" she asked as she put her book down. 

 "Yes. I left her twenty minutes ago." 

 "Did you shower after" she asked as she got off the bed. 

 "No." 

 "Good" she said as she walked toward him. "I'll show you how serious I was when I said I'd share." 

 She went to her knees in front of him and reached for his zipper. "I'll clean her off of you. How's that for sharing." 

 Her hand was on his zipper when he reached down and pushed it away. "That isn't necessary Shawna. I just wanted to know for sure." 

 "Why George? Why do you want to know for sure?" 

 "It is one of the things I need to consider Shawna. Good night." 

 He turned and left the room closing the door behind him and leaving her on her knees. She watched the door close and she wanted to scream. So close; so damned close. And just what was it he needed to consider? 

 He was lying in bed and staring up at the ceiling, his mind awhirl with thoughts. It was warm and so he didn't have the covers over him and he was the way he always slept - naked. His thoughts were interrupted when the bedroom door opened and Shawna came in. She closed the door behind her, walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. Before he could ask her what she wanted her hand went to his cock and she said: 

 "Just asking me if I meant it isn't finding out for sure George. For you to be sure I have to show you that I meant it; I have to prove it to you George. I have to show you how far I am willing to go to get you back." 

 She lowered her head and took his soft cock into her mouth and started sucking on him. His cock didn't stay soft for long. It had been a long time since Shawna had has sucked his cock, but he had not forgotten how good she was at giving head. He responded and she licked and sucked as she tried to remove any traces of Carol that he might still have had on him. There were none there because the last thing he and Carol had done was anal and he had washed his cock before leaving Carol, but Shawna didn't know that. She thought she was showing him her willingness to share him with his lover. 

 Shawna worked on him until he was rock hard which was not an easy thing to do considering how many times he and Carol had made love earlier that night. Was he ready for this? Was he ready to swallow his pride and put, or at least try to put, what she had done behind them? 

 She took her mouth off of his cock and moved over him. He could stop it; all he had to do was turn his body slightly so she couldn't do what she was going to try. If he let it continue he would be committing himself to at least making the effort to try and heal the gap between them and put them back together. 

 And then it was done! 

 She used her right hand to guide his cock into her pussy as she settled down on him to take him in deeper and she moaned: 

 "Oh yes. Oh yes baby. I need this. You will never know how much I have needed this; how much I need you." 

 She began to ride him. She rose and fell, rocked back and forth and she moaned and cried. It took him a while because of his evening with Carol, but she eventually got him off and along the way had three orgasms of her own. When his cock had gone soft she rolled off of him and lay down next to him and said: 

 "I needed that. You can't possibly know how much I needed that George. Just your touch George, just your touch. I meant what I said George. I'll do whatever I have to do to get you back in my life even if it means I have to share. I'll even go with you when you go to her and sit in a chair next to the bed and wait my turn. That's how desperate I am to have you back George." 

 She snuggled up to him and he felt her tears on his chest.

 Epilog 

 Carol was very understanding when he told he that he and Shawna were going to try and work things out. She said she knew that their affair wasn't going to last and she had expected that some day he was going to end it. She did ask if he was thinking of trying "the share thing" and when he shook his head "no" she said that she knew he wouldn't, that he just wasn't the type. 

 They did continue to have a close and friendly relationship at work and on the occasions when he stopped after work for drinks with his co-workers they did dance, but never as close as they once had. 

 Shawna quit her job. She said it was because she didn't believe that she could rise any farther up the corporate ladder, but he believed the real reason was that seeing Glen at work every day served as a constant reminder of something that she wanted desperately to forget. She found a new job without any trouble, but she never stops with her new co-workers after work for drinks. 

 It took six months of stepping carefully around each other before their relationship smoothed out, but it seems to be working and that is the best that either of them could hope for. 

 Three weeks after Shawna quit her job Glen was getting out of his car at his apartment when he was brutally attack by a man wearing a hood. The man used an aluminum baseball bat to smash both of Glen's knees so bad that he now has to walk with a cane. The police are investigating, but have no leads in the case. Report_Story
