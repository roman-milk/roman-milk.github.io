 ****** Lois Myra and Me ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I sat there in shock at what I was seeing. The camera angle was a little weird. It had obviously been put on a flat surface which had line of sight to the bed and was tilted a little to the right, but the content way over shadowed the position and angles of the recording device. 

 The question is how did it end up with my other tapes? The unlabelled tape was supposed to have been a program I had recorded last week for later viewing. I'd sat down expecting to be entertained and what I got instead was the biggest surprise of my life. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was a Monday evening and at six-fifteen the door bell rang and I answered the ring and found my cousin Ralph standing there. I thought that was a bit odd because I'm normally I'm not home until after midnight, but then I thought that Ralph had probably forgotten my schedule. 

 I invited him in, got him a beer, and then we sat and talked while watching Monday Night Football. He seemed disappointed that my wife Lois wasn't home, but she had called me about five and said she was going to stop after work for a drink or two with some of her co-workers. She also told me that she would be "Ready for some" when she got home. 

 I was more than ready. 

 It had been a little over three weeks since Lois and I had last made love. Lois had seemed to be going through a moody period of some sort. It had been nothing but "I'm too tired" or "I've got a headache" or "I've had a bad day at work and my feet and back are killing me." 

 After a bit Ralph said that he needed to be going and I walked him to the door and said goodbye. I glanced at my watch and saw that it was only eight so I got another beer and settled back down in front of the TV. 

 Later that evening I woke up in the recliner. The beers I'd had had relaxed me enough that I'd nodded off to sleep which is something I don't normally do. I got up and noticed that the Yukon was parked in the drive so Lois must have come home and I wondered why she hadn't got me up so we could go to bed and 'get it on' as they say, 

 I smiled and headed on up to the bedroom anticipating the sex that Lois had told me to look forward to. She was in bed and I undressed and snuggled up behind her and put my hard cock against her ass and then I reached around and cupped a tit and she gave a little snort and started lightly snoring. 

 "Fuck" I thought, "She's sleeping." 

 I thought maybe I could get her excited enough to wake up so I started playing with her tit. I tweaked and pulled on the nipple as I rubbed my hard cock against her ass. After a bit I felt her pushing her ass back at me and I started a slow humping against it. 

 At forty-four Lois was in much better shape than girls half her age. Her ass was round and firm and her tummy was tight. Her breasts were 34C and only had a slight sag to them. 

 I had noticed that when we were out in public together Lois attracted plenty of male attention and at times I was still surprised that Lois hadn't left me for someone richer, better looking, had a bigger cock or all of the above. 

 My cock size has been the only real insecurity I've had in our marriage and it went all the way back to when Lois and I had first made love. It was on our tenth date. We had been making out hot and heavy since our third date and it had been getting heavier and heavier with each date. At the end of the tenth date she invited me in when I took her home and she left me on the couch while she left the room to "put the coffee on." 

 She came back a couple of minutes later and she was stark naked. She smiled and said: 

 "Coffee, tea or me?" 

 I stood up and stripped and when I was naked she looked at my cock and said: 

 "I guess it will do." 

 She turned and headed for the bedroom and as I watched her walk away I thought to myself, "I guess it will do?" That and the tone of her voice led me to think that she wasn't overly impressed not that I expected her to say something like "Oh my god; I don't know if I can take that." I figured that I was average; average in my mind being between six and seven inches and I had six and a half so I thought I fell within the range. 

 Neither Lois or I were virgins by a long shot. We had both "been there and done that" and I knew several of her ex-boyfriends and I'd seen a couple of them in the locker room showers and they were roughly the same size as me so I was wondering what brought on her comment. 

 When we got to her bedroom she pushed me down on the bed and then bent and took me in her mouth. After a minute or two she took her mouth off me and said: 

 "It is the perfect size for sucking." 

 The way she said it and the tone made it sound like, "Its okay; it'll do." 

 She laid down on the bed and I returned the favor and did it well enough that I got her off and then I moved up and pushed me cock into her. She felt loose and I never 'bottomed' out in her like I had on past lovers. I was wise enough not to question the looseness and just made love to her. I did get her off a second time before I got mine and then we cuddled for a bit before she started fondling me and I got it up again. We made it two more times before calling it a night. 

 As I drove home I was thinking about her looseness and her "I guess it will do comment and it bothered me. Face it; no man wants to think he isn't enough for his lady, but that is what I was thinking. 

 After we had started 'making it' and had been at it for a couple of weeks Lois asked me if I thought she was too loose. I had no idea of what prompted the question (and I did think it weird that she asked it), but I wasn't stupid and so I lied and said: 

 "Of course not. I guess I'm just a little small for you." 

 "You aren't small at all baby; you are just perfect for me." 

 She was lying and I knew it. From a guy's perspective that was not the right thing to say. Be honest and admit it is a little small for you or work around it and say it is bigger than any other of the lovers you might have had, but don't be obvious about trying to spare his feelings. I was in love with Lois and when I finally proposed my cock size was apparently not a problem for her and she said yes. Even though she married me the "I guess it will do" never left my mind. Anyway; back to my trying to wake a sleeping Lois to try and get some loving. 

 As I was getting my hopes up with her starting to push back at my slowly humping cock she must have woken up or was starting to and she moaned and then reached back and took hold of my cock and then let loose of it as if it were a hot rock as she said: 

 "Oh. Its you." 

 My disappointment at her being in bed asleep after promising me sex instantly turned to red hot anger. I'd had enough of her shit. 

 "Just who the fuck did you think it was you miserable fucking bitch?! What the fuck is with this "Oh, it is only you" shit." Who the fuck have you been fucking behind my back?" 

 I got off the bed, grabbed my shorts off the floor and went downstairs. I got a beer and then went outside onto the deck and then sat down to cool off a little as I thought about what just happened. She was rubbing her ass against my cock and she reached back as though she wanted it and then let go of it as if it was red hot. The tone of her voice when she said what she said came across as "Shit! Its little dinky dick." 

 As I sat there and looked up at the moon and stars I wondered for the first time in our married life if her evenings out with the girls were really spent with girls. I now seriously doubted it. Shit! Were any of the things she did when she was away from me really what she said they were. My next thought was "Where in the hell can I scrape up enough money to hire a detective to find out just what the bitch did do with her time. 

 Another thing occurred to me. The bitch knew just what I was thinking from what I yelled at her and she didn't care enough about what I thought to drag herself downstairs and give me her usual excuses and try to mend fences. It was almost like "Oh well; now he knows. So the fuck what!" 

 I didn't want to go back upstairs and I was now wide awake so I decided to go back into the house and watch some TV. I had taped last weeks "NCIS" so I dug through the tapes until I found it (it was the only blank tape in the pile) and then I pushed it into the VCR. 

 The video explained it all. 

 I paused it and went quietly back upstairs to see if Lois was still in bed and when I looked in on her she was snoring softly. I went back downstairs and resumed playing the tape. I watched as my wife and my cousin Ralph came into the bedroom, embraced and kissed passionately. From the angle of the camera I guessed that it had been placed on the top shelf in the clothes closet. I could see most of the room and it was obvious to me that the two of them had done this before. 

 Ralph moved Lois to the bed and then they undressed each other. When Lois pulled down his boxers my jaw almost hit the floor. Ralph had the biggest cock I had ever seen. It must have been ten or twelve inches and almost as big around as my wrist. 

 He practically ripped the panties off of Lois exposing her shaved cunt and then he pushed her back onto the bed and dove face first into her box. He slurped and sucked and she came almost immediately and was running her hands through his hair while grinding her pussy into his face. Ralph stood up and said: 

 "How bad do you want to be fucked bitch?" 

 "I need it baby; hurry up and fuck me." 

 "Come on you cheating slut; tell me how bad you want it." 

 "Oh God please. Please hurry up and fuck me. Don't tease me baby; give me your cock." 

 He looked toward the camera winked and then wiggled his eyebrows like it was meant to be funny. 

 "How could she do this to me" I thought "And how many times and with how many men?" 

 I was hurt and angry, but I couldn't stop myself from watching. Ralph told Lois to get ready and she scooted her ass toward the edge of the bed, pulled her knees back and offered herself to him. He moved his cock toward her cheating cunt and I thought "This is going to hurt you bitch! That thing will split you in half and make you bleed and when that happens I'll stand up and cheer." 

 Ralph took his cock and rubbed it against her wet pussy and then he pushed. I have no idea of how long it had been since Lois had taken a cock bigger than mine, but as that huge thing slid into her I realized that it couldn't have been too long ago. Not as easy as that thing went in. 

 I at last realized what I probably should have known all along. The reason that Lois always felt loose was because she was used to having that cock in her. 

 "Oh God yes!" she yelled as Ralph began pounding her pussy. She reached around and grabbed his ass as it pumped up and down She tried to grip him with her legs, but his body was moving up and down as he furiously fucked her and she couldn't get a grip. Her legs started flailing around and I could hear his balls slapping her ass. Suddenly she cried: 

 "I'm coming, I'm coming; don't stop, please don't stop" and then she screamed in a way I'd never heard her as she orgasmed. Ralph kept at it through her orgasm and then he slowed down. After catching her breath I heard Lois say: 

 "I want to get on top." 

 Ralph pulled out of her and she moved over him. His cock was standing straight up and she lowered herself down on it. I still couldn't get over how big he was and how easily she was able to take him. As she settled down she moaned: 

 "Oh sweet Jesus; you are so much bigger than Dave." 

 She moved up and down on his rod and Ralph said, "You really like my dick don't you." 

 It was a statement more than a question and Lois answered "Oh fuck yes" and then she started riding his pole for all she was worth. As she worked herself on his cock he said: 

 "I'll bet Dave doesn't fuck you this good does he." 

 Again more of a statement than a question and Lois answered, "Fuck no. He sticks his little excuse for a dick in me and comes in the first ten seconds." 

 That hurt!! Size had always been an issue for me ever since I'd been with Lois, but the bitch had always assured me that it wasn't a problem, but I guess the truth has a way of eventually revealing itself. I was looking at a person that I guess I really didn't know. I do know that she never fucked me the way she was fucking him 

 I had two thoughts almost simultaneously. "What did I ever do to deserve this" and "All these years I've worried about size for no good reason." There was no way I could even begin to compare with what Lois seemed to be used to. I wasn't too small for her! Her cunt was too fucking big for a normal average sized man. 

 "Oh my God!" I heard from behind me and I turned and saw Lois standing there. "Oh God, oh God, oh God" she moaned as she hurried over to the telephone and quickly dialed a number as she chanted, "Answer damn it, answer! Answer the fucking phone." Then: 

 "Damn it Ralph; Dave knows. He got hold of that stupid tape you just had to make." 

 "I don't know how. You were supposed to take the damned thing with you when you left." 

 "You couldn't have it. Dave is sitting here watching it right now." 

 I guess I knew where my "NCIS" tape was. I got up and walked toward Lois and she flinched and shrank back from me. I guess she thought I was going to hit her, but what I did was snatch the phone out of her hand. 

 "Why don't you come on over and pick the tape up Ralph? Just make sure to wear a bullet proof vest when you come. It would be extremely wise of you to never let yourself be anywhere near where I might be from now on. Be advised that I intend to attend every family function from now on just hoping and praying that you will be there too. I won't waste my time looking for you, but rest assured that I will run across you some day and when that day comes it will be the worst day of your worthless life." 

 I slammed the phone down, looked at Lois and said, "Thanks to you and my asshole cousin I don't have to waste money on a private detective. The two of you have handed me all the evidence I need." 

 I went back to the VCR, ejected the tape and kissed it and then in I set it on top of the TV. In a shaky voice Lois asked: 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "What the fuck do you think I'm going to do? I'm going to divorce your skanky ass." 

 "But I don't want a divorce." 

 "Why the fuck not? It is obvious from what I just watched that you don't give a shit about me. You should be tickled to death that you are getting rid of someone who cums in just ten seconds after sticking his little excuse for a dick into your worthless cunt. Go pack a bag and get the fuck out of here before I really lose it and do to you what I'm rapidly beginning to believe you so richly deserve." 

 She almost ran from the room and as soon as she was gone I grabbed a blank tape and set it on top of the TV and then took the damaging tape out into the kitchen and hid it. 

 I made a pot of coffee and sat down at the kitchen table and started making a list of what I was going to have to do in the morning. We didn't live in a state that had no fault rules, but what I did know is that the courts generally went fifty/fifty on an asset split unless the reason was infidelity or criminal in nature. Adultery was a slam dunk for me since I had the tape. 

 The house had been left to me by my parents and I had been meaning to add Lois to the title, but thank God I'd never gotten around to doing it. As I worked on the list I heard Lois come down the stairs and a couple of minutes later I heard the front door open and close. I wondered where she would go at two in the morning, but then I didn't really give a rat's ass. 

 I did wonder how you could go from love to hate in a matter of seconds or minutes. Yesterday I would have been willing to die for the woman and now I wouldn't piss on her to try and put it out if she was on fire. 

 I reviewed the list and there were some things I could do right away thanks to the Internet. I got up and headed for the den and as I went through the living room I noticed that the blank tape I'd set on the TV was gone and I smiled. I just hoped that she assumed she had the damning tape and didn't watch it to be sure. If things played out the way I expected (and hoped) they would I might be able to break things off in her ass. 

 Once in the den I got on the computer and did some Internet banking. I transferred everything except ten dollars out of our joint account and into a savings account that was in my name only. I'd had the account when I married Lois and she had her own when we married and we never got around to joining the two. Next I handled the credit cards. I paid the bills on line so I logged into them and cancelled the joint accounts. I had an American Express and a Visa in my name only and I left those two alone. I'd call in the morning and verify that the accounts were closed. Satisfied that I'd done what I could do to protect myself I went to bed and surprisingly enough I slept soundly. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The alarm woke me at seven and I was dressed and out of the house by seven forty-five. After a breakfast at Tricocci's I headed for the bank so I could be there at nine when the doors opened. I called work from the restaurant and told my secretary I was going to be late and she told me that my wife had called for me and wanted me to call her. "Fat chance of that" I thought as I hung up. 

 When the bank opened I rented a safe deposit box in my name only and then transferred everything out of the box that Lois had access to into my new box. That done I headed for the office where Myra, my secretary, handed me a handful of message slips and told me that Lois was still trying to get in touch with me. I told Myra that Lois and I would be divorcing and not to bother taking any messages from her. Then Myra told me that Alan wanted to see me as soon as I got to work. 

 I went to the bosses office and Shirley, his personal assistant told me to go right in. 

 "You picked a bad time to be late" he told me as I walked in the door. "I need you on the next flight to Atlanta. Morgan's is balking at signing the new contract and I need you to get down there and nail them down." 

 I told him that it was a bad time for me to be leaving and I told him why. 

 "One of the things I need to do is get a restraining order to keep Lois away from me and the house and I need to get the locks changed. If I don't get those done she could strip the place while I'm gone." 

 "Give me your keys and I'll get it done. You can use Bert Ellsworth. He was my attorney when I went through my divorce and he did one hell of a job for me. I'll call him and tell him to expect your call. Call him on your way to the airport. Shirley has made your reservations and you can pick up your ticket at the Delta counter." 

 I couldn't say no. It was a great job and paid extremely well so I had to go to Atlanta whether I wanted to or not. 

 I hurried home, packed a bag and made sure that the telephone answering machine was on and then I headed for the airport. On the way I called the number for the attorney that Alan had given me and asked for Ellsworth. When I told the receptionist my name she put me right through. I explained the situation and told him what I wanted to do. He gave me some advice and I gave him my Visa number to retain him. 

 At the airport I suffered through the usual TSA bullshit, got to the Delta counter, checked in and then sat down in the boarding area to wait for my flight to be called. As I sat there I thought over what the attorney had told me. I lied and told Ellsworth that the reason I needed the order was that I'd overheard Ralph tell Lois that if I gave her any grief over finding out they were fucking that "He would make me see reason." 

 "I'll beat the little wimp until he sees reason" is what I told Ellsworth. And then I said I'd heard Lois say: Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Lois Myra and Me ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "Oh goodie. Can I watch and maybe kick him in the nuts once or twice?" 

 It was all lies of course and wouldn't stand up in a show cause hearing, but if it would keep Lois away from the house until I got back I'd lie my ass off. I'd earned the right by listening to all the lies she'd told me while fucking Ralph and only God and Lois knew how many others. Ellsworth said there would be no problem in getting the restraining order, but there would be a hearing in ten days where I would have to convince a judge to make the order permanent. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The trip to Atlanta was rewarding in that I solved the problem within an hour of meeting the people from Morgan's and I called Alan and told him we had a signed contract. 

 He told me that he had called a locksmith and that the locks on the house had been change. 

 "In addition to that my brother in law is a deputy sheriff and he is keeping an eye on the place until you get back." 

 As long as I was in Atlanta I paid a courtesy call on two other customers before catching the seven-twenty flight back home. As I was waiting for my flight to be called I remembered that I'd turned my cell phone off during my courtesy calls and hadn't turned it back on. When I did I found that I had six missed messages and three voice mails. One message and one voice mail were from Ellsworth and all the rest were from Lois. I deleted her messages and listened to her voice mails. They were both the same: 

 "Call me. We need to talk before things get out of hand." 

 The voice mail from Ellsworth told me that he had been able to get to court that afternoon and had gotten the order of protection. He would have it served on Lois at her place of employment the next morning. I'd have to thank Alan for recommending Ellsworth. 

 I got home at midnight and when I got out of the car a man got out of a car parked at the curb and came up to me. He identified himself as a deputy sheriff and asked me for some ID. 

 "You must be Alan's brother in law" I said as I took out my wallet and showed him my driver's license and then I thanked him for keeping an eye on the house." 

 He handed me a key ring with a couple of keys on it and said, "Brian told me to tell you that every lock in the house is keyed alike so you only need one key to get in all the locked doors. Your wife showed up here at four-thirty and again at nine. She was really pissed when I wouldn't let her in. She threatened to call the cops on me if I didn't let her into her house. She was a tad surprised when I showed her my badge and told her that the cops were already here." 

 Once in the house I noticed the answering machine light was blinking, but I was beat so I unplugged the phone and went to bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 In the morning after I showered, shaved and dressed I listened to the messages on the answering machine and surprise, surprise they were all from Lois and their content was all basically the same. 

 "Call me before you do anything rash." 

 Too late sweetie" I thought. "Way, way too late." 

 When I got to work Myra told me that Lois had called again and Myra had told her that she had been told not to put Lois through and that she wasn't even supposed to take messages from Lois. 

 "She hasn't called since." 

 I bent and kissed Myra on her forehead and said, "Don't know what I'd do without you." 

 She laughed and said, "I'll bet that you say that to all the girls." 

 I went into Alan's office and brought him up to date on the Morgan's situation and then thanked him for taking care of the lock problem at my house and sending me to Ellsworth. 

 "What's next for you" he asked. 

 "Get on with life. Try to find a good woman who will put up with me." 

 "You'll manage. The first couple of months are hard, but things will get better." 

 I went to my office and got busy. At nine I called Ellsworth and he told me the papers would be filed by ten and he could have Lois served before lunch time if I wished. I told him to go ahead and do it. 

 At ten to noon Lois stuck her head in my office and invited me to go to lunch with her. I needed a break so I said okay. We went to Tricocci's and grabbed a booth and after Mandy took our order Myra asked: 

 "How are you doing?" 

 "I'm okay. Why?" 

 "Both my oldest brother and sister are divorced and I know how rough it can be when you first starting going through the process and I know that having someone who isn't involved that you can talk with can help ease things for you." 

 "You putting in for the job?" 

 "Somebody needs to cheer you up so who better than me?" 

 "Cheering up? Yeah; I guess that is something I could really use right now." 

 Myra reached into her purse, took out a piece of paper and handed it to me as she said: 

 "Today's attempt at cheering you up." 

 I looked at the paper and saw that it was a list of names. 

 "What is it?" 

 "A list of the girls interested in you now that you are coming back on the market." 

 I scanned the list and saw a surprise or two. 

 "Liz Fisher? The drop dead gorgeous red-head in Accounting? I thought she was engaged. Last I heard was that the wedding was next month." 

 "She caught him cheating on her and gave him the boot." 

 "And you think she is interested in me?" 

 "I know she is. She once said that she would snatch you up in a heartbeat if you were single." 

 I looked at the list again. There were seven names on the list and besides Mary there were two that would interest me. 

 "You say that you know all of these are interested?" 

 "I've heard everyone of them express an interest in you a time or two." 

 I smiled and said, "I notice that your name isn't on the list." 

 "I considered putting it there, but decided under the circumstances I'd better not." 

 "Why didn't you?" 

 "Outside of the obvious fact that I'm married and you know it? 

 "Of course. You just admitted that you considered it." 

 "The answer is that you are just beginning to go through a divorce caused by a cheating wife. My thinking was that under the circumstances taking up with a married woman who plays would be the last thing on your mind." 

 "You play? I thought you and Harold were solid." 

 "We were until I found out that he was playing with the receptionist at his office. Rather than get a divorce I decided to keep my comfortable life style and pay him back in kind." 

 "Well you are wrong about one thing. Knowing that you are married and play wouldn't stop me. You should have put your name on the list. You would be the perfect woman for me right now." 

 "Now I know you are kidding. I'm far from being a perfect woman." 

 "That's were you are wrong. There are three names on your list that interest me, but you have one thing going for you that they don't have." 

 "And what pray tell would that be?" 

 "You are married and they aren't." 

 "Now that is something that you just have to explain." 

 "Right now an emotional entanglement is the last thing I need. It would be too easy to become emotionally involved with the three on your list that I would be interested in. You, on the other hand, are already spoken for and by your own admission you are happy playing tit for tat with your hubby. There wouldn't be any emotional component if I took up with you. What we would be is fuck buddies." 

 "You mean that? Really mean that?" 

 "Sure I do. Understand me here sweetie; I'm not the kind of man who would ever go after a married woman and try to seduce her. But one who let me know she was available? In a heartbeat sweetie; in a flat assed heartbeat." 

 "What would you say to a long lunch then?" 

 "I'd be all for it." 

 "Do we have time today?" 

 "Not today. I have a meeting with the people from Hayes at two, but I have a clear schedule for tomorrow." 

 "It's a date." 

 Was I being a hypocrite in fucking another woman while still being married to Lois and given that I was kicking her out for cheating on me? Not in my mind! According to Ellsworth Lois would have been served by the time I had my long lunch with Myra and once Lois had the divorce papers in hand as far as I was concerned we were legally separated and I would be free to do what I wanted. 

 At two forty-five my cell phone chirped and I looked at the screen and saw that it was Lois and knowing that it was probably because she had been served I decided to take the call. 

 "What do you want?" 

 No hello, just "What do you want?" I was tempted to say "What the fuck do you want bitch?!" but I decided that she already knew how I felt about her. 

 "Why can't I get in the house and what the hell is with this divorce garbage and why won't my credit cards work? And an order of protection? Are you out of your mind?" 

 "No; just out of a marriage. Your cards don't work because one of the things you do when you get rid of a cheating whore of a wife is cancel her credit cards. And the reason you can't get in the house is that you don't live there any more and I don't want you in it." 

 "You need to stop this nonsense Dave. You can't seriously want to lose half of everything you have over me having a little sex on the side. That's all it was Dave; just some recreational sex. There wasn't any love involved. You are the only one that I love." 

 "I don't see it that way Lois. As far as I am concerned you are a cheating whore and that is why I filed using adultery as cause." 

 "We need to talk. We need to sit down face to face and talk about this Dave." 

 I think I surprised her when I said, "Okay. Where and when?" 

 "The house tonight at ten?" 

 "I don't think so. I've got you out of the house and I'm not letting you back in." 

 "You can't keep me out of the house Dave." 

 "Of course I can. I own the house Lois. You aren't on the title. My parents left the house to me, not me and you. I will let you in to get the rest of your things, but only after my attorney sets it up so that there will be some one from the court there to make sure that you don't take anything you are not entitled to." 

 "Why don't we forget about all this legal stuff and just sit down and work it out?" 

 "I said I was willing to talk Lois, just not at the house." 

 "You are being totally unreasonable Dave. If not the house then where?" 

 "Tomorrow night at Angellina's at six. We can take the booth in back and that should give us enough privacy." 

 I closed the phone to end the call wondering if Lois really thought I was stupid enough to buy the "It was only sex with him; it's you I love" bullshit. Even as I had the thought I knew that the answer was yes. And why wouldn't she think I was stupid. I'd been dumb enough to let her get away with what she had been doing for years and years. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That night when I got off work I stopped at The Landing Strip Lounge to have a drink or two to drown my sorrows. Also, since it was Wednesday it was open mike night and I thought that maybe one or two of the comics might be able to make me laugh and cheer me up. 

 I took a seat at the bar and Karen saw me, came over and asked: 

 "The usual Dave?" 

 "I don't know sweetie. My usual order is for a PBR and a date with you and so far all I've gotten is the beer." 

 "I keep telling you Dave; I've got a keeper and I'm going to stick with him." 

 "I guess just the PBR then." 

 As she walked to get the beer I watched the sway of her ass and wondered if her keeper appreciated what he had. A five foot five fiery redhead with tits to die for if her low cut blouses weren't lying. I'd been flirting with her for years knowing that harmless flirting is all that it was, but with Lois out of the picture I really wouldn't mind taking a serious run at Karen. But then there was that "Keeper" thing. Oh well. 

 Up on the raised bandstand a woman was taking her shot at being a standup comic. 

 "A surveyor drops by Will's farm in eastern Minnesota and announced he had some bad news. 

 "I discovered that your farm isn't in Minnesota. It's actually in Wisconsin." 

 Will let out a huge sigh of relief and said, "That's the best news I've had in a long time. I was just telling my wife this morning that I don't think I can take another winter in Minnesota." 

 She got a good laugh from the crowd and went on with: 

 "The New York City Department of Education says that only 26 percent of the city's students in grades three through eight passed the English portion on a recent standardized test. But on the bright side they're too bad at math to realize how bad that is." 

 She got a polite laugh on that one, but hit the next one out of the park. 

 "A new pastor was visiting the homes of his parishioners. At one house it seemed obvious that someone was home, but no answer came to his repeated knocks. He took out a card and wrote "Revelation 3:20" on the back of it and stuck it to the door. 

 "When the offering was processed the following Sunday he found that his card had been returned. Added to it was "Genesis 3:10." Reaching for his Bible he checked out the citation and broke up in gales of laughter. 

 "Revelation 3:20 begins, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." Genesis 3:10 reads, "I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid for I was naked." 

 There were two more good comics after her and I left the place feeling a lot better than I'd felt going in. Maybe there was some truth to the old saying that "Laughter was the best medicine." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day at work and before I even had a chance to sit down at my desk Myra reminded me that we had a lunch date. The morning was fairly busy and at eleven-thirty Myra and I went to lunch. As we drove to the Marriott I asked her if she really wanted to have lunch first and she laughed and said: 

 "Sex on a full stomach slows me down some and I don't want slow for my first time with you." 

 I checked us in as Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Tomlinson. I thought it was fitting that I was using the name of Lois's asshole lover to get my first piece of ass from another woman. 

 Once in the room Myra immediately started to undress and she managed to get naked a lot quicker than I did, but then she'd had a head start. She had come into the room not wearing panties or a bra and she didn't take off her high heels or thigh high nylons. The sight of hr standing there would have given a stone statue a hard on, but the sight didn't give me one, but only because I'd gotten mine in the elevator on the way up to the floor our room was on. 

 "Ooooh, that's a nice one" Myra said as she looked at my erection. Imagine what that did for me after hearing what Lois had said that caused me to carry around that insecurity for years. Myra laid back on the bed, spread her legs and said: 

 "Come and get it lover." 

 I joined her on the bed and moved to go down on her, but she said, "None of that lover. Maybe later, but I've been hot and wet since we made this date yesterday. Fuck me first and we can do other stuff later." 

 I wasn't going to argue and I moved up and put the head of my cock against her slit and pushed. She was indeed wet, but even so I had to work my way in which was something I'd never had to do with Lois. Myra moaned, her legs came up to clamp me and her hands went to my butt and she tried to pull me in deeper. I started the in and back motion and Myra moaned: 

 "That's it baby; do me. Do me hard baby; do me hard." 

 I did my best and was rewarded when she had a screaming orgasm following which I had mine. It was a first for me. I'd never witnessed a screaming orgasm produced by me. Lois had cum, but it was never a loud event, at least not with me. I did see her do a loud one, but it was on the tape I had of her with my asshole cousin. 

 I held myself in Myra until I went soft and when I pulled out she turned and said, "Now we can do some of that other stuff" and she went for my cock with her mouth. I pulled and tugged until I had her in position for a sixty-nine. She fought me saying: 

 "Don't do that; it's nasty down there" 

 "Don't care" I said, "It's mine" and I pulled her down and went to work on her. As I worked on Myra's cum muffin I thought of how many times I done it with Lois not knowing that she was cheating on me. The thought almost caused me to lose the erection that Myra's mouth was building. 

 Almost, but only almost. 

 As soon as Myra had me up she swung over me and mounted me cowgirl and I laid there and let her do all the work. I looked up at her and saw her smiling down at me. 

 "Like this lover? Like looking up at my bouncing, swaying tits?" 

 "No" I moaned. "I hate it; I absolutely hate it." 

 She laughed and said, "Yeah! Right!" 

 When she had me close I had to roll her onto her back and drive hard to get my nut and when I did I had another first. Myra came just as I did and that was something that had never happened for me before. 

 We separated and as much as I would have loved to lie down next to her and cuddle for a bit I couldn't. A long lunch was something we could get away with, but not an afternoon. I got up, made quick use of the bathroom and started to dress. 

 "You can stay a bit and shower or clean up" I said, "But I have to get back to work." 

 "Don't be silly" Myra said. "Why should I wash you off of me? Going to hubby with the smell of my lover still on me is one of the parts of my getting even with him. I'll douche at work just before I go home because he might get suspicious if I'm too wet down there and I don't want to give him any ideas. I'd love to have him go down on me with you still in me, but I don't dare take the chance." 

 When she said that I thought of all the times I thought of all the times I'd gone down on Lois or slid into her loose cunt and commented on how wet she was. She always said that it was because she got all hot and bothered thinking about what we would do when we went to bed. The stupid thing is that I believed it until I saw the tape of her and Ralph. 

 That of course put another thought in my mind. Lois never really cared about me to care to care about whether I figured it out or not. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The rest of the day went by quickly and then it was time for me to head for Angelina's to meet with Lois. I got there first and took the booth in the back. I wanted that one because it was the farthest from the dance floor and consequently was the quietest. I ordered my usual and settled in to wait for Lois. 

 Lois came in five minutes later and as usual she looked sexy as all get out. She had obviously dressed to give me a hard on in the hope that it would make me more pliable. Usually seeing her like that would give me instant wood, but knowing what she'd done to me and my marriage killed that urge. 

 She sat down and when the waitress came and asked Lois what she wanted to drink Lois ordered her usual Cosmo and got a severely pissed look on her face when I told the waitress: 

 "Separate checks please." 

 I took a pull on my beer and then said, "Okay Lois; you called this meeting so speak your piece." 

 Honestly Dave; you could be a little more civil." 

 "Given the circumstances Lois you are lucky that I'm not trying to wrap my hands around your throat and strangle your cheating ass. I'm sitting here looking at your throat and imaging how good it would feel to have both hands around it and squeezing it hard. You wanted to talk so get to it or I'm going to get up and leave." 

 She sighed and said, "You are overreacting to things Dave. There is no need for us to divorce. I love you and I always have and always will. The thing with Ralph doesn't mean a thing to me. Yes I was having sex with him, but that is all that it was - just sex. Most of the time I don't even like him, but he fills a need that I have. He has never been a threat to you or our marriage." 

 "If he means nothing to you why did you neglect me in order to take care of him?" 

 "I've never done that!" 

 "Of course you have. Just think back over the last six months. Just how often did you grant me, most times reluctantly I might add, your sexual favors? Hell! Just think back over the last three weeks. I listened to your excuses night after night and went without while all the time you were fucking some one else. That's what you call loving me and only me?" Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** Lois Myra and Me ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "It hasn't been that long." 

 "It damned sure has. Three weeks of avoiding me and when you finally tell me I'm going to get lucky when you get home you go straight to bed and go to sleep. When I tried to get something going you were all for it until you realized it was me. Remember that Lois? Remember that "Oh, it's you. I'm tired. Leave me alone." That said it all Lois. That "Oh; it's only you" said it all. Then seeing that tape was the final nail in the coffin. That "Poor excuse for a dick and cums in ten seconds was the hammer that drove that final nail down." 

 "Oh come on Dave; you know that what I said wasn't true. When have you ever cum within even a couple of minutes? You almost always go ten or more minutes. Usually a lot more and you know it." 

 "Then why would you even say those things to Ralph?" 

 "Because Ralph likes to hear it. He has some crying need to hear that he is so much better than you. I say garbage like that to stroke his ego. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you as a lover Dave. You have always gotten me off." 

 "Then why are you fucking other men?" 

 "It isn't other men Dave; it is only Ralph." 

 "So in your mind it isn't cheating on me since it is only Ralph?" 

 "That isn't what I said." 

 "It doesn't matter Lois. One man or a hundred, fucking a man other than your husband is cheating any way you want to look at it." 

 "Answer me this Dave. Up until you saw that tape wouldn't you say we had a good marriage?" 

 "Good maybe, but certainly not great." 

 "Well I've been seeing Ralph since before we were married and it hasn't affected the marriage at all." 

 "You were fucking my asshole cousin even before we said I do?" 

 "Yes I was." 

 "Then why in the hell did you even bother to marry me?" 

 "Because I love you Dave. I barely even like Ralph." 

 "Then why the hell are you fucking him?" 

 "Because he gives me something physically that you can't. Size Dave. All Ralph has going for him is size. He hits places inside me that you can't. Those places give me feelings that you can't give me. Why don't you look at it as Ralph just helping you out with me?" 

 "You have to be brain dead if you think you can sell me on that one. If that is all you have to talk about then we are done here." 

 I started to stand up and she said, "You will never be able to sell adultery Dave. You don't have any evidence to back it up." 

 "You forget that I have the tape that you and Ralph so graciously made for me." 

 "Are you sure?" 

 "Of course I am" I said and then I walked away from her. I was smiling as I walked out the door. Obviously she hadn't looked at the tape she took from the house so she didn't know that she had a blank one. I was just reaching for the door handle on the car when I heard the 'click click' of high heels coming my way and I turned to see Lois half walking and half running in her high heels. I was amazed that she could move that fast in them. 

 She hurried up to me and said, "I need to get in the house Dave. I need my clothes and things." 

 I knew when I said it that I was being an asshole, but I honestly felt that I had the right to be one when I said: 

 "Have your lawyer call mine to set it up" I said as I got into the car. I rolled down the window and said, "Bye bye Lois" and drove off as she cried out: 

 

 "Wait Dave. Wait a minu..." 

 I could have let her follow me home and get her stuff. It wouldn't have hurt me any to do it, but I'm afraid that my mind set at the time was "Fuck that bitch!" If she didn't already have a lawyer it would take her a day or two to get one and since it was Thursday I was betting that the soonest she could get one would be Monday and then another day to arrange to get her into the house. By that time I'd have everything of hers in garbage bags and I wouldn't use 'reasonable care' in doing it. If I was lucky she would have to take it all to the dry cleaners or the Laundromat before she could use them. 

 Was I a little bitter toward Lois? Nah! Everything was sunshine and roses where Lois and I were concerned. 

 I slept well that night. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Friday I had another long lunch with Myra and at the conclusion of a rather strenuous period Myra asked me if I had plans for the weekend. When I said that I didn't she asked: 

 "Want to spend the weekend with me?" 

 "I'd love to, but how would you hide it from your hubby?" 

 "He's leaving on a weekend fishing trip. He packed his car this morning and he will be leaving right from work. You have me from now until noon on Sunday. That is if you want me." 

 "Silly girl. Let's see now. Dinner and dancing this evening. Go home and play. Wake up Saturday morning and play most of the day. Dinner and dancing Saturday evening and then go home and play. Wake up Sunday and play until noon and then go out for a late breakfast. That sound about right?" 

 "All except for the dancing part. I say more play and less dancing." 

 "Wouldn't work. Yours never wears out, but mine tends to need rest at times." 

 "Okay then; I guess we go with your plan." 

 We went back to work and at quitting time I told her that I would pick her at seven. 

 "Pack for the weekend" I told her, "Because I don't intend to bring you back until Sunday afternoon." 

 When I got home I found that Lois had decided not to waste time trying to get a lawyer. When I went up to the bedroom to change clothes I saw that Lois's side of the walk in closet was empty. I looked around and saw that most of her other stuff was gone. I went looking to see if I could figure out how she got in. 

 Didn't take long to find it. One of the windows in the family room that looked out onto the patio had been broken out. Nothing I could do about it. Calling the police would be a waste of time since I couldn't prove that Lois did it. I did get just a wee bit of satisfaction. There was some blood on some of the broken shards of glass. Lois must have cut herself climbing in. 

 I grabbed the Yellow Pages and found a glass company, called them and made an appointment for the next day. Then I decided to leave the mess until the morning and that decision made I went upstairs, showered and dressed for my date with Myra. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We had dinner and then went dancing and drinking. At eleven we were in bed, but we didn't fall asleep until three and believe me when I say I was pretty darned tired when Myra got through with me. 

 I set the clock for nine since the glass company said they would be there between ten and twelve. I shouldn't have bothered with the clock because Myra woke me up at seven-twenty in a most marvelous way. I woke up to find my cock in Myra's mouth. That led to a session of doggie followed by some sixty-nine followed by some missionary and then a shower. 

 The soaping and washing of each others backs, sides and then fronts led to Myra being taken from behind as she leaned against the shower wall. More soaping and washing led us back to the bed. By then it was almost time for the glass man to show up so breakfast was out and we would instead have an early lunch. 

 While waiting for the glass guy I cleaned up the broken glass and had just finished when the glass man got there at ten-ten. He was all done at ten-forty and by eleven Myra and I were at Tricocci's having a late breakfast. After Jared had taken our order I asked Myra what she would like to do that afternoon. 

 "Lay around. Make lazy love. Cuddle." 

 "I can do that." 

 And that is just what we did. We were in a mellow mood and by five we decided that we would call out for pizza and just keep up with what we had been doing most of the day. We decided not to play on full stomachs so we cuddled on the couch and watched some TV for an hour or two and then in the middle of a program I don't even remember the name of Myra started rubbing my cock. 

 Two could play that game and I started playing with her tits. She retaliated by pulling my cock out into the open and going down on it. Refusing to let her gain the upper hand I pulled her down on the floor, pushed the gusset of her panties aside and fucked her. 

 Guess I showed her right? 

 Once we'd made it off the floor and into the bedroom Myra asked me why I'd never tried her ass. 

 "I guess it is because every girl I've ever had never let me do it so I don't think about it any more." 

 "Then you are in for a treat tonight. I love it up my butt." 

 Never having been there before I couldn't believe how tight it was. As I fucked Myra's tight ass I thought of Lois's loose pussy. If I'd taken her ass would it have been tight too? Or would it have been as loose as her cheating cunt. Did she give her ass to her big dicked lovers even though she'd never given it to me? I guessed I'd never know, but then I really didn't need to any more. The bitch was gone! She would still be around on the fringes as we fought our way through the divorce process, but she was 97% out of my life now. 

 Myra was pushing her ass back at me and moaning "Yes yes yes" as I pounded into her and then she surprised me and had an orgasm. I didn't know a woman could have one while being taken anally. I smiled and wondered what other things Myra was going to teach me. One thing I did know and that was that I was going to take all that Myra would give me for as long as she was willing to give it. 

 As her orgasm ebbed I redoubled my efforts and got mine. As we rested I said: 

 "You really do like it that way?" 

 "I love it." 

 "Then I guess we will have to do a lot more of it." 

 She got up from the bed, went into the bathroom and came back with a washrag. She smiled and said: 

 "Got to clean this guy up so I can work on him to get him up again." 

 She managed to do it, but I don't know how. With all we had done from Friday until I finished in her ass I would have bet money that she couldn't get another one out of me. I've got to learn not to bet against a determined woman. We started doggie and I finished in her ass. She did the washrag thing again, but I was done and we fell asleep cuddled up against each other, 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 With Sunday morning came the realization that I was going to have to give her back to her husband. With that realization came a thought and over pancakes at the Village Inn I asked: 

 "How long have I got?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "How long before you drop me?" 

 "Why would you think that I'd drop you?" 

 "From the way that you said it when you told me that you played around on your hubby I got the impression that you just did it here and there and didn't hook up with anyone for long periods." 

 "Maybe, but it was never my choice. Usually the guy I would hook up with would eventually get a little possessive and want me to dump Harold for them. The problem with that is that they were not in Harold's class. None of them could keep me in the life style I enjoyed as Harold's wife. I just couldn't see leaving a nice house in a good neighborhood to live in a two room apartment and spend my time wondering if we would be able to pay that month's bills. 

 "Besides, most were not any better in bed than Harold and there was also the fact that they were dirt bags. At least that is the way I looked at it. They had to be dirt bags if they were hitting on a married woman and I always wore my rings." 

 "I don't understand the logic there. You went out looking to get hit on and you knew that they knew you were married when you hooked up with them. 

 "True, but I wasn't looking for a replacement for Harold; I was simply looking to get even. That I hung onto them if they were halfway decent in the sack didn't mean that I really cared all that much for them. Face it; if they came after me knowing I was married do you think I could ever trust them if I made the relationship permanent?" 

 "So I'm just another dirt bag?" 

 "Don't be silly. Of course you aren't. I've worked for you for over five years now and not once in all that time did you ever do so much as flirt with me. Think on what got us here lover. I as good as gave you an engraved invitation. You flat out told me that you would never go after a married woman and you didn't. I put it out there and you were smart enough not to turn it down. If any dropping gets done it will have to be you dropping me." 

 "I can promise you that if I do it won't be any time soon. Do we have time for one more before I have to get you home?" 

 She gave me a big smile and we did. 

 When I went to bed Sunday night I was one of the most sexually satisfied men in the state and maybe even the surrounding ones. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday as I drove to work I thought on my relationship with Myra and I knew that it couldn't continue; at least not as it had gone on over the weekend. I had sued Lois using adultery as grounds and if she got an attorney one of the first things he would do (if he was worth a shit) would be for her to get something on me she could counter with. If she couldn't counter I would come out ahead in the asset split. My getting caught with Myra would give Lois that counter, but there was no way I was going to go without sex for as long as the divorce would take. I'd gone without long enough while I was married to my whore of a wife. 

 I called Myra into my office when I got to work and laid out the problem for her and then asked if she had any ideas. 

 "A couple, but I don't know if you can swing it." 

 "Tell me and let's see." 

 "You have these three uncomfortable chairs in here for when clients visit. You need to get a comfortable couch in here for them to sit on." 

 "I can do that." 

 "Then you stay and work late a lot so naturally I'll have to stay late to assist you. Then after we have put the new couch to good use you leave, I'll wait ten or fifteen minutes to give whoever might be watching you time enough to follow you so they won't be there to see me leave." 

 "That should work." 

 "Another thing we could do is I'll leave for lunch before you do and go to the hotel, get a room and then call you with the room number. When you get to the hotel take the elevator to the second floor where all of the conference rooms are and then take the stairwell up to the floor the room is on. We won't be able to do that very often though. There is a limit to how many conferences you can attend without making people wonder." 

 "What would keep them from coming up to verify that I was in a conference?" 

 "Before you come up the stairwell hang a "Do Not Disturb" sign on one of the conference room doors, but it really won't matter. They will need to see us together and as long as we come and go separately we should be fine." 

 I told Myra to plan on a conference the next day and then I sent her back to work. I had a full day so I didn't get around to ordering the couch until around four. I didn't waste time going through channels to get it approved; I simply ordered it and paid for it myself. 

 At five I called Myra into my office and told her that she needed to tell her hubby that she needed to work late on Thursday. 

 "They will be delivering the couch around noon." 

 "How did you get Ahern and Accounting to approve it so fast?" 

 "Didn't use them. I bought it myself." 

 She looked around and didn't see anyone (the office door was open) and kissed me. Then she said: 

 "I was hoping that I wasn't going to have to wait for Thursday." 

 "Have you already forgotten the conference with the folks from Ajax tomorrow?" 

 "Damn! How did that slip my mind?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was in a good mood all the way home and then the good mood fled when I got to the house and saw Lois parked in the driveway. She was parked in the middle so that I couldn't get by her to get in the garage. I parked so she had room to back out and leave. When I got out of my car she got out of hers and then she walked up to me and said: 

 "We need to talk Dave. Things are getting way out of hand." 

 I ignored her and walked by her to her car. I opened the door and reached in and grabbed her purse that she'd left on the seat. I turned it upside down and dumped the contents on the seat. I picked up her wallet and took all the money out of it and counted it and then put it in my pocket and dropped the wallet on top of the rest of the junk on the seat. 

 "You still owe me fourteen dollars for the window you broke and we don't need to talk. I've already said all that I need to say to you." 

 "Damn it Dave; I love you and I don't want a divorce. We can work things out. It doesn't have to be over for us." 

 "Yes it does Lois. There is no fucking way we can stay together especially after my finding out that you have been stabbing me in the back since before we were even married. We are done Lois! Finished! Kaput!" 

 "I had hoped that you would listen to reason, but I guess deep down I knew you wouldn't. If you are dead set on a divorce I'm going to have to fight you. I will not accept adultery. I know how this state is and I will not settle for a 70/30 asset split with me getting the low number." 

 "I'm sorry that you don't think you need to be punished for what you did to me, but the adultery stands." 

 "You will have to prove it Dave and you can't. It will be your word against mine and I'll deny it to hell and back. I'll say that you are just trying to cheat me out of my fair share of our assets. You might even be penalized for it." 

 "You seem to forget that I have visual proof of you committing adultery with my asshole cousin." 

 "No you don't Dave. I grabbed that tape when I left the house and then destroyed it. It will be you word against mine and lacking any proof you will lose." 

 "You destroyed it? Ralph will never forgive you. He did so want that tape. He might even be so pissed at you for destroying it that he just stop fucking you." 

 "Will you get it through your head that I don't give a shit about Ralph? Yes, I wanted what he had, but I don't need it. I need you." 

 I shrugged and said, "You still owe me fourteen dollars for the window" and walked away from her and went into the house. The cunt didn't give up easily. She beat on the door and rang the bell for a good ten minutes before she finally left. 

 As I watched her back down the driveway I was smiling. She had obviously destroyed the tape without looking at it to make sure she had the right one. Was she ever in for a surprise. I wanted her to get an attorney and fight the divorce. I wanted her to go into debt, to spend a thousand or more dollars on attorneys only to find out that I still had the tape and that she had spent her money for nothing. 

 I slept soundly that night. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 My Tuesday conference with 'the people from Ajax' went well and I was in a pretty good mood when I went home from work. Wednesday wasn't all that bad either since Myra wanted a quickie on my desk at closing time. After a quick check to make sure everyone else was gone I obliged the lady and when we were through I reminded her that she would be expected to work late on Thursday. 

 On the way home I decided to stop at my watering hole of choice which was The Landing Strip Lounge. I'd forgotten that Wednesday night was open mike night and when I got there I had trouble finding a seat. Finally a seat opened up at the bar and I grabbed it. I got there just as Bobby Denton handed the mike to a trailer repair mechanic who worked at Triple T Sales and Service over in Franktown. 

 An eight year old girl went to her grandfather, who was working in the yard and asked him: 

 "Grandpa, what is couple sex?" 

 The grandfather was surprised that she would ask such a question, but then he decided that if she was old enough to ask the question she was old enough to get a straight answer. Steeling himself to leave nothing out he proceeded to tell the young girl all about human reproduction and the joys and responsibilities of intercourse. 

 When he finished explaining the little girl was looking at him with her mouth hanging open and with eyes wide in amazement. Seeing the look on her face the grandfather asked her: Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** Lois Myra and Me ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© "Why did you ask this question honey?" 

 "Grandma told me to tell you that dinner would be ready in a couple secs." 

 The crowd roared with laughter and he followed that one up with: 

 "There was this guy and he was pretty smart. He had degrees in both Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and one day as he was driving home he heard a commercial on his car radio that he figured was an outright lie. He thought about it and when he got home he sat down in his den and drew up the plans for a lie detecting robot. 

 "When he was satisfied with his plan he went down to his basement workshop and started building it. It took him six weeks and when it was done he was ready to test it. It just happened that he had the robot with him in the living room when his fourteen year old son came home two hours late. The man asked his son why he was so late. His son said that he had been playing cards with his buddies and he had lost track of time. The robot wheeled over to the boy and slapped him. The man said: 

 "Tell me the truth now. Why are you late?" 

 The boy said, "It wasn't nothing. We was just looking at some porn that Johnny's father had." 

 The man shook his head and said, "When I was your age we didn't look at porn" and the robot slapped him. His wife laughed and said: 

 "He takes after you George. He certainly is your son." 

 And the robot slapped her. 

 That got another roar from the crowd. 

 There was a break in the action so I finished my beer and went on home. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day two good things happened. The first was my attorney calling to tell me that he had been contacted by an attorney representing Lois and had been told that she was going to fight the divorce. That caused me to smile. 

 The second thing was that my black leather couch was delivered. I went with leather because I figured to clean up the cum stains that were bound to get on it. It turned out that it was a wise move on my part because Myra and I did leave some deposits on it later that afternoon. 

 The next couple of weeks slid by without much happening. Myra and I got it on three or four times a week, mostly on the couch after hours, but we did do the conference room three times because face it, just as the couch was better than the desk a bed was better than a couch. 

 Also during that period Lois called me almost daily telling me that she needed me and telling me that I simply could not win so why not just accept things as being in the past and best forgotten and get on with our lives together. I could have put a stop to the calls by getting a new cell phone with a different number and getting the number on the home phone changed, but I got some sort of perverse pleasure out of telling her that she was wasting her time. All the while knowing that she had no idea of what was going to fall on her. 

 Meanwhile Ellsworth and the attorney that Lois had hired spent time hashing things out. I hoped that Myra's attorney was being paid by the hour and driving up her tab. I had negotiated a flat fee with Ellsworth so I didn't care how long things were drug out. Ellsworth knew about the tape and in fact he had it in his possession, but he never told Lois's attorney that it existed. 

 They haggled back and forth with the other attorney arguing that Lois would stop fighting the divorce if I changed the grounds from adultery to irreconcilable differences and agreed to an equal split of the assets. To give Lois some hope I told Ellsworth he could drop it from 70/30 to 65/35 knowing full well that she wouldn't take it. 

 Ellsworth told me that he was going to have to let the opposition know of the tapes existence before going in front of a judge. He said that the judge would be pissed - extremely pissed - if we hadn't made every attempt to come to an agreement before coming in front of him. I told Ellsworth to use his best judgment. What the hell! It was what I was paying him for right? 

 Lois did put someone on me or at least I was pretty sure that she had. I was suddenly seeing a guy around that I had never seen before. I never caught him actually looking at me, but h seemed to be around no matter where I was. Maybe it was me being paranoid, but then again maybe not. 

 Another week went by and I got a call from Ellsworth. Lois and her attorney wanted a meeting. I told him to set it up and let me know when. He called me back and said Friday at ten in the morning. I was there at nine-thirty and talked things over with Bert. We decided to bring the tape into play at the meeting, but I wanted to fuck with Lois one last time. 

 The meeting started with the usual bullshit. Lois denied committing adultery and said I was being unreasonable. Then I said: 

 "You keep forgetting that I have the tape that you and my asshole cousin made." 

 "No you don't! You have nothing to prove your claim and you know it." 

 "I'll tell you what I'll do Lois. If you will sign the papers right now I'll go for a 60/40 split. That offer is good for the next two minutes. If you don't sign I guess the judge will be the one to set the split." 

 "I'm not accepting it Dave. You have no proof." 

 "Of course I do Lois; I have the tape of you fucking Ralph." 

 And then Lois did what I'd hoped she would do. She got pissed and let her mouth run away from her. 

 "Damn it Dave! I already told you I destroyed that damned tape!" 

 "Oh? So you admit that you committed adultery and then destroyed the evidence?" 

 Her eyes got big as she realized what she had just said. 

 "No. I didn't mean it that way." 

 "Doesn't matter Lois. I offered to cut you some slack, but you being your usual pig-headed self turned my offer down. We will just have to let the courts decide." 

 Then Lois's attorney spoke. "If you do indeed have the evidence it would be best to bring it out into the open now." 

 I nodded at Ellsworth and as he went to push the play button on the TV/VCR setup on the end of the table I said: 

 "Last chance Lois. I'll go 60/40, but once he pushes the play button the offer is withdrawn and we will go to court. 

 "Fuck you Dave. You don't have a thing you can use." 

 Bert pushed the play button and I stood up and said, "See you in court Lois" and I left the room. 

 I wasn't out of the building when my cell went off. It was Burt. 

 "They want to deal." 

 "No thanks. I gave her an out and she wouldn't take it so full speed ahead." 

 All that did was increase the number of phone calls I was getting from Lois. I'd unplugged the home phone and Myra knew not to put any calls from Lois through to me so the only way Lois could get to me was my cell. I kept the cell and the number just to fuck with Lois. It tickled me to see the number of calls I got from her that I never took. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 As far as my sex life was concerned Myra was giving me almost more than I could handle, but I wasn't going to complain. 

 Three days after the meeting with Lois and the attorneys Myra said: 

 "We have a problem; a very big problem." 

 "Oh shit!" I thought, her hubby has found out about us. 

 "How bad is it" I asked. 

 "Pretty bad. Harold has to fly back to Ohio to handle something pertaining to his parent's estate. He will be gone a week." 

 "So what's the problem?" 

 "How are we going to manage spending a week together?" 

 I thought for a minute and then said, "Easy. You leave work a half hour before I do and drive to my house. Park one block over and then go into the house and make sure that all the curtains and blinds are shut tight. Then when I come home we play. I leave for work in the morning and if I am being watched that will pull them after me. You wait ten or fifteen minutes to let me get clear and then you leave and come to work. We will just keep repeating it until the weekend and then come up with another plan." 

 "How about this for a weekend plan. I do the same thing that I do all week only Friday when you get home we just never leave the house for the entire weekend. Think you can handle two and a half days with me?" 

 "What I'm not sure of sweetie is that I can survive two and a half days with you." 

 "We won't know until we give it a shot." 

 And that is just what we did and I did manage to survive the weekend, but the weekend - as good as it was - caused me to get a bit moody when it was over and Myra went home so she could be there to greet hubby when he came home. 

 I had gotten too used to Myra. Besides the sex she was good company and I got along great with her, but I knew me well enough to know that once my divorce was final I was going to be looking for a replacement for Lois. I had liked being married. I was going to want a fulltime relationship. I wanted to be able to go to sleep at night cuddled up to a woman who would be there in the morning when I woke up. 

 I could very well see me doing it with Myra, but Myra never gave any indication that she would ever dump Harold. I'd always gotten the feeling that she was happy with him (except for his fucking around on her) and was content to stay with him as long as she was able to repay him in kind. 

 I remembered the list she had shown me that had been the impetus for our affair and I mentally reviewed it. There were three that I would love to fuck, but I couldn't see any of them as wife material. Two of them smoked and I didn't and from living with my parents I knew I couldn't live with a smoker. Both of my parents were two pack a day smokers and the house always smelled like a wet ashtray. The stink was on everything; clothes, furniture, curtains and the list could go on and on. 

 The one non-smoker was Liz from Accounting and she was also the sexiest of the three, but I thought that she was too young for me and the age difference meant that it wasn't likely we would have enough common ground to work with. I'd once gone to her office to check with her about an item on one of my expense reports and she was listening to rap music (if it could indeed be called music) and I can't stand the stuff. Liz might be fun to play with for a while, but I couldn't imagine that we could make it long term. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 Those were the thoughts I was having as I drove to work on Monday. Once at work I got too busy to spend any time thinking of personal problems. I was so busy I had to say no when Myra stuck her head in the office and asked me if we were on for a long lunch, 

 Just before quitting time I got a call from Bert Ellsworth. He said that Lois was desperate to settle. 

 "I know that for you it is all about sticking it to her, but I think you would be wise to offer her 60/40 to get her to sign now. I know that in most cases adultery does play a big part in getting the aggrieved party a bigger share of the assets, but two of the seven judges who sit on divorce cases are women and they tend to go 50/50 regardless of the cause and we just might be unlucky enough to draw one of them. I think it would be in your best interest to settle." 

 I gave it maybe thirty seconds of thought and then I told him to offer her 65/ 35 and see if she would go for it. 

 At quitting time Myra came into the office and said, "I didn't get my long lunch so can I at least get some couch time?" 

 She could and did. 

 The next morning at ten Ellsworth called and said that Lois had accepted the 65/35 offer. He said that she would be in at five on Wednesday to sign the papers and had asked for a short meeting with me. I couldn't see any benefit to it other that to give me one more chance to snarl at her, but I wanted to get things over with so I didn't have to sneak around with Myra any more. I told Bert that I would be there at two and give her the meeting that she wanted. 

 We went into a conference room and I took a seat and waited for her to speak her piece. She saw that I wasn't going to say anything so she took a deep breath and said: 

 "I don't want this Dave. I know you don't believe it, but I do love you. Is there anyway at all that we can work things out and stay together?" 

 "Not a prayer Lois. Not after finding out how long you had been doing it. I'll be straight with you here. If you had gone through a short affair with someone I might - just might - have let it pass. Say maybe you had a few large cocks before we married and then were a faithful wife for years until you somehow discovered that someone had a big one and you remembered how good it felt and fell into a short relationship with him I might have been able to get by it. 

 "But a continuing affair since before we even said I do? Not a chance in hell Lois. No way we can get by that. The guy you say you barely like is getting steady pussy from you and the man you profess to love gets to go without anywhere from three weeks to two months? It won't wash Lois; it just won't wash. Is that it? Is that all you have to say?" 

 "Please Dave. Please give us a chance." 

 "Can't do it Lois. I'd never trust you again and I won't live like that." 

 I stood up and walked to the door. I turned and said, "You are a good looking woman Lois so I doubt that you will be alone for long. When you do hook up with someone I can only hope that he fucks over you as badly as you fucked over me." 

 I left the room and headed for the Landing Strip. I took a seat at the bar and Karen came over, set a PBR in front of me and said: 

 "Where you been hiding handsome?" 

 "Been going through a divorce and haven't been feeling all that sociable. I thought I'd come in and have a beer or two and unwind. 

 "Divorce huh? That mean that I might be able to bring you under my spell?" 

 "I thought you were spoken for. I've been flirting with you for years and you've always told me how great you had it with your guy." 

 "Hah! Had it great but only because I thought he was something he wasn't." 

 Before she could go any farther another customer called for her attention and I watched her nicely shaped tight ass as she walked toward him. She was busy most of the time my two beers took up so I didn't get a chance to talk too much with her. 

 I'd had enough so I waved Karen over to settle my tab. She took my money and when she came back with my change she gave me a smile and said: 

 "When the divorce stuff is over and done with keep me in mind okay?" 

 "I can do that. Take care" and I headed for the house in a damned fine mood. Karen interested in me? Who would have ever thunk it. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 As far as I was concerned once Lois signed the papers it was a done deal and even though there would be a wait for the final decree I could move on with my life. To me that meant freedom from worrying about being watched. Myra and I could stop sneaking around. 

 Around ten Myra came into the office and asked if we were on for a long lunch and I told her yes. 

 "I'll leave around eleven-twenty and get the room" she said. 

 "No need for that any more. Lois signed the papers yesterday so we don't need to try and avoid something that might have never been there anyway." 

 We left for the Marriott at eleven-thirty and we were alone in the elevator on the way down to the lobby when Myra grabbed my hand, picked up her skirt and placed my hand on her naked pussy. 

 "I just want you to know how eager I am." 

 I worked a finger into her pussy and she moaned just as the dinger sounded that said the door was opening. We hurriedly rearranged ourselves and then rushed out of the building. 

 When the door to room 403 closed behind us we went at each other like wild animals after downed prey. No foreplay - just straight into missionary. Then came sixty-nine, doggie, sixty-nine and then the doggie position with me rooting around in Myra's root cellar. 

 As we dressed Myra asked, "What now?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I mean that now you are free are we done being fuck buddies?" 

 That caught me flat footed, but it didn't take long for me to come up with the answer to the question. 

 "As long as you want me sweetie I'll be around, but eventually I'm going to want to find me a wife. I liked being married." 

 "What would you be looking for in a wife?" 

 "She would need to be reasonably good looking, love sex, be strong enough to put up with me and be a pretty good cook." 

 "I can cook." 

 I looked at her for the second or two it took for what she was actually saying to register on me and then said: 

 "If you are applying for the position I will move your application to the top of the pile. There is one small requirement however. I won't be party to committing bigamy." 

 She looked at me with a confused expression on her face and then it hit her. She gave me a big smile and said: 

 "Not to worry lover; he doesn't know it yet, but Harold is history." 

 Then a thought hit me and Myra saw the expression on my face change and she asked: 

 "What is it baby? What's wrong?" 

 "We just got to where we don't have to hide things from Lois, but now we have to hide things from Harold while you go through your divorce process." 

 "I might be wrong, but I don't think that will need to happen. I'll give him a choice between adultery or irreconcilable differences. I've more that enough evidence to make adultery stick and if I go that route and say I'm going to broadcast it to the world he might quickly accept irreconcilable differences. Harold is a ladder climber where he works and he has his eyes on a VP position. The CEO is a fanatic born again Christian and so are a couple of the board members. I don't believe Harold's prospects would be all that great if I let the word out on his adultery. It might mean a motel room for me for a week or two, but we know how to work around that right?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Myra's game plan worked out pretty much as she thought it would and she didn't waste any time putting it into affect. She called Ellsworth (on my recommendation) and had an appointment for Friday. She had Bert draw up two sets of papers; one for adultery and one for irreconcilable differences. Saturday at eleven forty-five, just before the bank closed, she took half of the checking account, all of the savings and four of the six CDs out of their safe deposit box. 

 She went home, packed (Harold was off playing gold) and moved her stuff into her car and by three she was moved into a motel room. She went home, fixed dinner, opened a bottle of wine and as she and Harold had dinner she informed him that she knew of his affairs, had PI reports on three of them and that she'd had enough and was going to divorce him. She told him what she had done with the money and that she would sign her share of the house over to him. She considered that more than fair since her share of the equity in the house was more than she'd taken out of the bank. 

 She gave him the divorce paperwork and told him what his options were and told him he had until ten o'clock Monday morning to let her know which way he wanted her to go and then she got up and left the house smiling because she left Harold the dirty dishes. 

 She was not surprised when Harold called her on her cell and said he would prefer to go the irreconcilable differences route. The two of them met at Bert's office on Wednesday and Harold signed on the dotted line. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Myra decided to stay at the motel through the weekend to give the dust time to settle and then I moved her in with me and we were going to live together until our divorces were final and then we would get married. 

 Once that happened we were going to have another problem to face. Myra was damned good at her job and didn't want to give it up. The problem was that the company we worked for had a policy of family members not being allowed to work together. We could both still work for the company but one of us would have to transfer. The problem with that is that the closest company facility we could transfer to was ninety miles away and that just wasn't going to work for us. 

 We decided to lie. We just wouldn't tell the company that we were married. Myra wouldn't change her name and would keep her company health insurance. We would do it until we were caught (if we were) and then Myra would resign and find another job. If she wanted to. She really didn't need to work since I was very well compensated for what I did.

 ****** Lois Myra and Me ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Sunday she checked out of the motel and by three that afternoon she was living with me and the next two months quickly went by with no problems surfacing and I began to relax and let my guard down. 

 Big Mistake. 

 Lois called once or twice a week and I usually took the call primarily so I could have the satisfaction of shutting her down. I should have known she wouldn't quit bugging me. 

 It was a Wednesday night and Myra and I were at The Landing Strip enjoying a toddy or three. We stopped in from time to time (and not always on Wednesday) because it had always been my favorite watering hole, but our main reason for being there that particular night was because one of the girls from accounting was going to get up and give it a shot. We were there for encouragement and moral support. 

 Shelly was okay, but our opinion (Myra's and mine) was that she better hang onto her day job instead of trying to go into show biz. She started off with: 

 "A man was sitting reading his daily paper when his wife came up and hit him on the head with a frying pan. "What was that for" the man asked. The wife replied "That was for the piece of paper I found in your pant's pocket with the name Jenny on it." 

 The husband said, "When I was at the races last week Jenny was the name of the horse I bet on." 

 The wife apologized and went on with her house work. Three days later the man is watching television and his wife walked up and smacked him on the head with an even bigger frying pan knocking him unconscious. When the man regained consciousness he asked his wife why she had hit him again. 

 "Your horse called" replied the wife. 

 After a polite laugh from the crowd she went on with, "An old man and woman were married for many, many years even though they hated each other. Whenever there was a confrontation yelling could be heard deep into the night. The old man would shout: 

 "When I die I will dig my way out of the grave and come back and haunt you for the rest of your life." 

 Neighbors feared him. They believed that he practiced black magic because of the many strange occurrences that took place in the neighborhood. The old man liked the fact that he was feared. 

 To every one's relief the old man died of a heart attack when he was eighty- five. His wife had a closed casket at the funeral and after the burial she went to the local bar and began to party as if there were no tomorrow. Her neighbor's, concerned for her safety, asked: 

 "Aren't you afraid that he may indeed be able to dig his way out of his grave and come back to haunt you?" 

 The wife put down her drink and laughed. "Let him dig. I had the old fart buried upside down and I know him well enough to know that he won't stop and ask for directions." 

 As I said, okay, but she needed to keep her day job. 

 Bobby Denton was just introducing the next hopeful when I felt something wet splash on me as I heard: 

 "You keep your fucking hands off my man you fucking whore!" 

 I turned to see that Lois had come up behind us and poured a drink on Myra's head. Before I could stand up and do anything Myra threw her drink in Lois's face and when Lois's hands flew up to her face Myra grabbed my longneck, stood up and cold-cocked Lois with it. Lois fell to the floor and I grabbed Myra and hustled her out the door. 

 I had some rags in the trunk of my car and I got them and was drying Myra and myself off when Lois came out the door. She was unsteady on her feet from being conked on the noggin by a beer bottle and she was being assisted by none other than my asshole cousin Ralph. I dropped the rag in my hand and yelled "You rotten son of a bitch!" and I went running at him. He let go of Lois, who fell to the ground, and then took off running. I chased him for three blocks before I gave it up and went back to the Strip's parking lot. 

 When I got there Myra had Lois pinned to the fender of a car and as I came up to them I saw Lois was crying and Myra was yelling in her face: 

 "Get it through your thick head you stupid cow! I did not steal him from you. You threw him away and I was lucky enough to catch him." 

 When I came up to them Myra stepped back from Lois and said: 

 "Let's get out of here." 

 "Get in the car. I need to go inside and straighten things out with Joe" (Joe Lambert who was the owner). 

 I went inside and found Joe and asked if there were any damages I needed to take care of and he said no and laughed as he said: 

 "Next time do it during intermission so the customers will have something to watch when there is no one on the mike." 

 When I got back outside I found Lois waiting for me just outside the door. A quick glance showed that Myra was in the car waiting. Lois stepped in front of me and said: 

 "Please Dave; drop the divorce. I'm dying baby; I need you. I love you and I know we can work it out." 

 "You have to be the dumbest human being on the planet Lois. Standing here professing to love me while your date for the evening is the reason for the divorce. Not only that but you were stupid enough to call attention to the fact that you were here together. You need to let things go Lois. The only feelings I have for you are hatred and disgust. Leave me alone!" 

 I stepped around her, got in the car and drove off. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Both divorces became final and I proposed to Myra and was surprised when she said: 

 "Ask me again in a year baby. By then we will have lived together long enough to make sure we are a good fit." 

 I gave her a year and then asked again and she said yes. We had both already done the big wedding thing and didn't want to go through it again so we settled for a civil ceremony and a Justice of the Peace. 

 Lois married Ralph and the marriage didn't make it to the two year mark. It seems that Ralph was sharing his big dick with several other women and one of them gave him an STD which he in turn gave to Lois. Apparently cheating on me was acceptable, but cheating on her was a completely different matter and she wasn't having any of that. 

 Six years after my wedding to Myra Ralph was stupid enough to attend a wedding that I also attended and I made good on my long ago promise to him. 

 It might be some time before I'm invited to a family function again. Report_Story
