 ****** Dancing Shayna ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I sat at the table nursing my Pabst, rubbing my ankle and watching Shayna dance. I swear that woman was conceived on a dance floor and was born to spend her life on one. I didn't look around to verify it, but I would have been willing to bet that most of the eyes in the place were on her and her partner. Not that he had anything to do with it. Shay made every man she danced with look like Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly even if they had two left feet. 

 Normally I would have been the one out there dancing with her, but I had sprained my ankle at work and was in no shape to do much in the way of walking let alone dance, but I had promised her a night out. Even in the best of shape I couldn't keep up with her on the dance floor so I was used to her dancing with others. 

 Most of the people there were regulars and they knew the signs. Once I sat down after dancing with Shayna and didn't get up for the next set they knew that they could come over and ask her for a dance. Shay would ask me if I minded and I of course never said no. Over the course of an evening I would dance about two thirds of the dances and the others would get the other third. I didn't really mind since I loved watching her move as much as I loved being out there with her. 

 As I watched her move to the music I was remembering how I met her. It was at a high school dance. She was there with a guy from the football team and he had no rhythm at all. He could move okay on the football field, but on a dance floor he might as well have been a tree stump. Shayna was getting frustrated with him and it showed. I had been watching her and even with the tree stump she looked good. As I watched I was thinking that it was a shame that she didn't have a partner who could do her justice. 

 I had come to the dance stag, not because I couldn't get a date, but because I had been expecting to have to work that night so I didn't make any plans to attend. Then a girl quit and the boss had to reshuffle the work schedule and I ended up with the night off. It was too late to come up with a date and knowing that some girls went to the dances stag I decided to go. 

 There were about a dozen girls who came alone so I was able to find plenty of dance partners. I liked to dance and thanks to a mother who had made me take dance lessons I wasn't half bad. Not in Shay's league, but then who was? 

 I knew who Shay was, but I didn't know her. She had transferred in from out of state at the start of the tenth grade, but there were 242 kids in our class and you couldn't know all of them. Add to that we didn't run in the same circles. She ran with the 'jocks' and the so-called 'in' crowd and I came to school, did my time and right after class I headed for my part time job. 

 Anyway, back to Shay and the stump. Everyone in the place could see that she was frustrated and she was overheard saying that she must have been out of her head to have come to the dance with Jimmy. Bear in mind I'm not bad mouthing Jimmy here, just saying that he could not dance well enough to suit Shayna. 

 I was talking to a couple of guys when the band started playing a tango. Someone tugged on my sleeve and I turned to see Shayna standing there. 

 "Frank, right?" I nodded a yes and she said, "Can you tango Frank?" 

 I said that I could and she took my hand and led me out onto the floor. Didn't ask me to dance with her, just took my hand and pulled me after her. I'm not going to say that it was magical moment, but we did move rather well together. When the song ended I walked her back to the table where she had been sitting, thanked her for the dance and then went back to the guys I had been talking to. 

 Five minutes later Phil Reed said, "Here comes your new girlfriend again." I turned and Shayna walked up to me. 

 "Got a minute? She asked me. 

 "Sure." 

 "Can I talk to you in private?" 

 "I suppose" I said and she led me a little ways away from the group I'd been talking to. 

 "I have a problem; two problems actually. Jimmy couldn't tango and he apparently got pissed when I asked you to be my partner. Bev Holbrook said he grumbled for a couple of seconds and then suddenly said "Screw the bitch. She can walk home" and he took off. I need a dance partner for the rest of the night and I need a ride home. Can you cover the dance partner part?" 

 "I can do both if you don't mind being seen in the ratty wreck that I call a car." 

 "As long as it doesn't leak when it rains." 

 "It hasn't yet, but I'm making no promises for the future." 

 I spent the rest of the evening as Shay's dance partner and when it was over I drove her home. When I walked her to her door she said: 

 "I had fun. What do you say we do it again sometime?" 

 "I'd like that." 

 "Call me. We're in the book." 

 "It may be a while. Depends on my work schedule." 

 "That's okay. Just make sure that you call some time." 

 That was the start of my relationship with Shayna. Our dating was a bit irregular because I didn't have a steady work schedule. It changed from week to week so Shayna and I never did reach the boyfriend/girlfriend going steady stage and because of my irregular schedule she couldn't depend on me for her regular date nights which were Friday and Saturday. Her parents wouldn't let her date during the week and since three out of every four weeks I could count on days off in the middle of the week she dated other guys on the weekends. 

 I would have loved to be her steady, but the only way I could do that would be to quit my job and I couldn't do that. My parents let me get a car when I was sixteen and they had paid half, but I had to take care of the plates, insurance, gas and upkeep on my own and that meant having a job. I was able to make sure that my boss scheduled me so that I was able to have the night of the senior prom off and I was able to ask Shayna to go with me well ahead of time and she said yes. 

 The night of the prom was sheer magic as far as I was concerned. Shay and I danced every dance together and once we were the only couple out on the floor when the band played a samba. When the prom was over we hit a couple of after prom parties and at the one at Tim's house Shayna said: 

 "I have a surprise for you baby." 

 "You do? What?" 

 "On my seventeenth birthday I promised myself I was going give up my virginity on my eighteenth birthday or on senior prom night whichever came first. I was eighteen last Saturday, but the guy I was dating was nothing special and I knew I was going to be at the prom with you so you get the prize. That is you get it if you want it. What do you say?" 

 My mom and dad didn't raise any stupid kids so you know what I said to that and I quickly found us a motel. Shayna didn't know it, but I also started out the night as a virgin. I had no experience, but I had seen at least a dozen porn videos so I did know what to do. I wasn't as quick to get off as I'm told some first timers are, but I credit that to the fact that I had been beating my meat on the average of a half a dozen times a week and the last time had been just two hours before I had picked Shay up to take her to the dance. I had also read a lot of Penthouse Letters so I thought I had a fair idea of what a woman would like. 

 I was determined to make Shayna think I was special so as soon as we were naked and had all of the kissing and hand work out of the way I surprised her and went down on her. Shay had said that she was a virgin and I had no reason to doubt her, but I was a virgin also and that didn't necessarily mean I was totally inexperienced. I'd had a tit or two in my mouth and I'd fingered a few pussies. I'd gotten a hand job from Nancy Wilde and a blow job from Beverly Abbeg so it was possible that somewhere along the line Shayna had had her cookie munched on. I hoped she hadn't because she would know that I didn't have a clue as to what I was doing and I didn't want that. I wanted her to think that I was THE MAN! 

 Everything that I had read had said that the clit was the key and so I went looking for it. I found it, latched onto it and Shayna went wild. She screamed, hollered and grabbed my hair and pulled my face into her pussy. She bucked, rolled her hips, moaned and in general made me feel like I knew what I was doing. Finally she pushed me away and said: 

 "In me, I need you in me now. Hurry damn it, I want you in me." 

 I slid my hard cock into her sopping wet pussy and she went wild again. I felt like I was at the rodeo and trying to hang on for the ten second ride. Thank God it took a whole lot longer than ten seconds. I assumed that all the bucking and thrashing she was doing was her experiencing orgasms and if that was the case she must have had several. I finally came and fell on the bed next to her gasping for breath. 

 "God" she said, "I had no idea. I want to do it again. Can we? Can we do it again?" 

 We could and we did. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 After prom night things went back to the way they were before. I got maybe one weekend off in three and Shay always went out with me on the Fridays and Saturdays I could get off even if she had to break a date with someone else to do it and we always ended the date making love. 

 I talked with Shayna about going steady and being exclusive, but she said no. She did it gently, but it was still a no. 

 "I would love to baby, I really would, but I can't just sit home on Fridays and Saturdays just because you have to work. I could do it if you only had to work the weekend once in a while, but you usually end up working most of them." 

 I was hung up on Shay, but I wasn't stupid. Shay was out dating on the Fridays and Saturdays that I couldn't get off and since she took to sex like a baby duck takes to the water I figured that her other dates were getting lucky also. I didn't know it for sure; I suspected it and it pissed me off, but there wasn't anything I could do about it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 Graduation came and with it came change. Shay went off to college, but higher education wasn't in the cards for me. My dad got me into the tool and die apprentice program where he worked and that meant that I could give up my part time job. Now I had my weekends off, but Shay was gone. 

 The college was fairly local â only thirty miles away â but I figured that Shay would be meeting a lot of new guys and some college asshole would snap her up so imagine my surprise when I got home from work on Friday after my first week in the apprentice program and my mom told me that Shay had called and wanted me to call her. 

 "What time are you picking me up tonight?" 

 "What?" 

 "You aren't working weekends anymore and there is a party at Carol Moser's. What time are you picking me up?" 

 I picked her up at seven and from then on we were exclusive. I proposed and she accepted, but we agreed to wait until she graduated before getting married. We hit a rough spot in her junior year when she wanted to go with some of her friends to Florida on spring break and I didn't want her to go. We argued and I got the "You don't own me" speech and she went to Ft. Lauderdale. That got my back up so when she came back I avoided her and wouldn't take her calls. We spent three months apart before she camped out on my front porch and wouldn't move until I promised to sit down and talk with her. 

 We married six months after Shay graduated and had just celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The music stopped, the band went on their break and Shay's dance partner brought her back to the table and thanked her for the dance. We sipped our drinks and socialized with the people we were sitting with until the band came back. When their next set had started a guy walked up to our table and asked me if he could dance with Shay. I took one look at the guy and knew right away that I didn't like him. Just looking at him gave me a bad feeling. I looked over at Shay and I could see that she wanted to be out on the dance floor so I did what I always did and said I didn't mind if my wife didn't. 

 The guy was good; I'd have to give him that. He and Shay seemed to glide across the floor with a fluid grace that I might have admired if I hadn't taken such an instant dislike to the guy. The tune ended and Shay and her partner stayed on the floor and waited for the next number and when it started they moved into each other's arms and started moving to the music. 

 I watched for a bit and then got up and went to the restroom and on the way back I stopped to talk with a guy I'd gone to school with and hadn't seen in a while. When I got back to the table Shayna wasn't there and I noticed that her purse was gone so I figured that she was in the ladies room. When she wasn't back in fifteen minutes I looked around for her, but didn't see her anywhere. After another five minutes had gone by I went to the woman's bathroom and found that she wasn't there. 

 I was standing in the hallway leading to the restrooms and looking out across the dance floor when a cute blond walked up to me and said: 

 "You won't find her here." 

 "What?" 

 "Your wife, girlfriend or whatever. You won't find her here." 

 I looked at her and asked, "What do you mean?" 

 "She left with the asshole who brought me." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "They left the dance floor, walked to your table, she took her purse and then they walked out to his truck and they drove away." 

 "This is a joke right?" 

 "Afraid not. We have been abandoned." 

 I spent another half hour looking for Shayna without finding a trace of her. I called her cell a couple of times, but it went to voice mail. I finally had to accept what the blond told me. I went looking for her and when I found her I asked her to tell me where her date lived. 

 "No idea. This was only my second date with him and all I know is that he is a freelance carpenter, likes Mexican food, drives a late model Chevy pickup and lives in an apartment on the east side of town and I only know that he lives in an apartment because he was always bitching about the noise that the people above him made. What are you going to do?" 

 "I guess all I can do is go home and wait to see what happens." 

 "Would it be too much trouble for you to give me a lift? I didn't bring enough money for a cab and I don't know anyone here." 

 "Grab your stuff and let's go." 

 "On the ride to her place she asked, "Does she do this often?" 

 "This is the first time she has ever done anything like this." 

 "Been together long?" 

 "Married five years last week and together a couple of years before that." She was silent the rest of the way to her place and when we got there she said: 

 "I should invite you in and then fuck your eyes out so if I ever see him again I could tell him how good you were and thank him for making it possible for me to experience you. The only problem is that if I did it I would hate myself in the morning." 

 "That's okay. You are a fine looking lady and I'd be hard pressed to say no if you did invite me in, but I would say no. I've never cheated on Shayna and although things don't look too good right now I still need to find out what is going on before I write the marriage off and start looking for companionship." 

 "If and when you do start looking you know where I live." 

 "True, but I don't know your name or phone number." 

 "That's right you don't. How silly of me. I should have introduced myself when I asked you for a lift." 

 She dug around in her purse and pulled out a card and handed it to me. It read: 

 Tanya Ensign 

 Real Estate Broker 

 And it gave five phone numbers, a fax number and an internet address. 

 "Use the cell number. It is the quickest way to get me." 

 "Nice to meet you Tanya Ensign." I offered her my hand and told her my name. 

 "Nice to meet you Josh Daniels. Thanks for the ride and good luck to you." 

 I drove home and Shayna wasn't there when I got there and there were no messages on the telephone answering machine. I tried her cell one more time and it went to voicemail again. I didn't bother to leave a message. I turned on the TV and watched drivel until two a.m. and then I went to bed. 

 Shayna wasn't home when I got up in the morning and when she hadn't shown by noon I called her mother and sister, but neither one of them had heard from her. Naturally they wanted to know why I was looking for her and so I told them what little I knew and her mother told me that I should call the police. I wasn't quite ready for that yet. I called a couple of her friends with no luck and after a dozen calls to her cell I gave up on that. At six that evening I finally called the police only to be told that the person needed to be gone forty-eight hours before they would take a missing persons report. 

 Meanwhile I was getting more and more pissed with the situation and by the time I woke up Sunday morning I'd had it. I called a locksmith and by two in the afternoon I had all the locks on the house changed. By six that evening I had everything of Shayna's boxed and bagged and in the garage. I didn't change the code on the garage door opener so she could get in and get her stuff if she ever came home. 

 I was on pretty good terms with my neighbors and I talked to several of them and told them that my wife had run off with a truck driver and I expected her to come home while I was at work and clean the place out. I asked them to please get a license plate number if anyone brought Shayna to the house. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I got up and went to work and during my lunch hour I went over to the police station and filed the missing persons report. The detective who took it was up front with me. 

 "There isn't much we can do. She left the place under her own power, willingly got in the guys truck and drove off with him. We will keep an eye on the hospitals in case she should turn up, but we aren't going to waste any manpower on it." 

 I told him that I understood and I left the station and went back to work. At two I got a phone call from Alan who was the guy who lived next to me on the south side. 

 "A red Chevy pickup pulled into your drive about five minutes ago. Your wife got out and tried to get in the house but couldn't and then she got back in the truck and they left. I got the plate number." 

 He gave it to me and I wrote it down. I called a friend who I knew could get me the information out of the DMV and at four he called me back with the name and address of who the Chevy was registered to. At four-ten I got another phone call. It was from Shayna. No hello, just: 

 "I got home and couldn't get in." 

 "Not surprising since I changed all the locks." 

 "Can I come home?" 

 "Sure you can as long as you understand that you won't be getting into the house. All of your stuff is in the garage. The old code still works so you can get in and get it. Anything still there come next trash day will go out on the curb with the rest of the garbage" 

 "I need to talk with you honey." 

 "Don't "honey" me Shayna, you gave up that right. And as for talking? You said it all with what you did Friday night." 

 "Please Josh, I h......" 

 "I have to get back to work Shayna. Goodbye." 

 But it is never that easy. 

 When I got home that night Shayna was sitting on the front porch steps waiting for me. I don't know how long she had been there, but if she showed up at the time I normally got home from work she had been sitting there almost four hours. 

 When I got off work I went and checked out the address I'd been given for the owner of the Chevy. It was an apartment on the east side of town just as Tanya had said. There was no Chevy truck in the parking lot so I parked where I could see the door to apartment 2A and settled in to wait. I was there a little over an hour and forty minutes before a red Chevy Silverado pulled in and parked. When the driver got out I saw that it was the asshole who had asked Shayna to dance on Friday night.  

 

 ****** Dancing Shayna ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I sat another hour and watched and then the door to 2A opened and the asshole came out dressed in a set of leathers. He walked over to the side of the maintenance building and pulled a tarp off of a Harley soft tail. He fired it up and motored off into the night. I'd seen all that I needed to see at that time so I went on home to find Shayna waiting for me. 

 "Where have you been? I've been waiting here for hours." 

 "Since I no longer have anyone to rush home to I ran some errands when I got off work. What the fuck do you want?" 

 "I want to sit down and talk to you." 

 "Talk about what Shayna?" 

 "About my being stupid and fucking up. Can we go in the house and get comfortable and then I can speak my peace." 

 "I can hear you fine right here." 

 "I don't want the neighbors knowing my business." 

 "They neighbors already know. I talked to all of them, told them that you'd run away and would probably be back and try to break into the house and for them to call the cops if they saw it happening so just go ahead and say what you want to say." 

 "Please Josh. I don't want the world to know. Let me tell you in the house.." 

 I wanted to take a hard line with her, but unfortunately I loved the stupid cunt so I gave in and let her come in the house. She sat down at the kitchen table and I got two beers out of the fridge and sat down with her. I slid one of the beers across the table to her and then sat back and waited. She took a pull on the Bud and then said: 

 "This isn't going to be easy and to explain it I need to go back a ways. It started when we had that big argument when I went to Florida on spring break. I was pissed and the first night there I met a guy at a party, he hit on me and my mindset was: 

 "I'll fucking show Josh. He doesn't own me. I own me and I'll do what I fucking well please." 

 "I ended up in bed with Dan. I can't sugar coat this Josh. It was absolutely the best sex I've ever had in my life. I had what seemed like continuous orgasms that left me as limp as a wet dish rag. This is not a shot at your abilities Josh; you are a marvelous lover. Dan was not a marvelous lover. In fact he was a little crude, but what Dan brought to the party was a ten inch cock. When it was in me it touched places that had triggers that I had no idea I had. 

 "I spent the whole break with him and when break was over he wanted me to stay in Florida with him, but no way was I going to do that big cock and continuous orgasms or not. He was a clod and all he had going for him was a big cock. From time to time I think about Dan and his cock and how I felt when he was in me. It is a fond memory, but Dan was out of my life and a fond memory was all that I had and all that I would ever have and I knew it. 

 "Until Friday night. When I danced with Craig he pushed his cock into me a couple of times. Nothing new there; it happens all the time when I'm dancing with guys and it has never bothered me, but with Craig it was different. He felt huge. I pulled away from him and looked at him in surprise and he smiled at me and said, "Yes sweetie; it is real." 

 I said "No way" and he said "Way. Want to see it?" 

 "I'd been drinking and was in a pretty good mood â you know how I get when I'm dancing with a really good partner - and I said "Sure." We danced over into a corner and with his back to the dance floor and me blocking the view from the other side he took it out. It was just as long as Dan's had been, but was a little fatter. He told me to touch it. It was like I had been transported back in time. I was looking at Craig's huge dick and remembering a week of almost continuous orgasms and I reached out and took hold of it. It throbbed and he said: 

 "You want it and it wants you. Lets get out of here." 

 "I honestly must have been in a trance as he led me out to his truck. I wasn't thinking of anything except how it was going to feel as soon as I could get him in me. I honestly never thought of you or the fact that I was a married woman until sometime on Saturday morning. I woke up, saw Craig sleeping next to me and it was only then that I thought "Oh My God, what have I done." I panicked, jumped out of bed and started looking for my clothes. Craig woke up, grabbed me and pulled me back down on the bed and then I forgot about everything except the feeling and the orgasms. By the time we were through on Saturday I was afraid to come home or even call you. 

 "Sunday it was more of the same, but I can honestly say that on Sunday I really didn't want to be there. I wanted to be with you. I wanted to be loved, not fucked. No sugar coating here Josh, I loved every inch he pushed into me, but all I was to him was the flavor of the weekend and all he was to me was a giver of orgasms and nothing else. It took me from noon on Sunday till this afternoon to work up the courage to come home and when I got here I couldn't get in. You will never know what it took to get me here to be on the steps waiting for you to come home. A dozen times I wanted to get up and run away. Where I got the guts to come here and stay here and sit it out I'll never know." 

 I looked at her for several moments and then said, "So why are you here Shay? You worked up the nerve to come here, but why?" 

 "Because I want to come home." 

 "You take off with some big dicked asshole, stay gone for three days and then you expect me to take you back?" 

 "I'm hoping. I got stupid and I fucked up and I know it, but I love you Josh and I need to be with you. I'm hoping that you can find it in your heart to forgive me and let me come home." 

 "For how long? Until this Craig asshole calls you and asks you if you are ready for another fun weekend? Until the next guy with a big dick pokes you on the dance floor. Can you give me a good reason why I should take you back? Just one good reason Shayna?" 

 "I love you and I know you love me; at least you did until last Friday night. We've had a great five years together and I promise to make the next twenty- five just as great if you will give me the chance." 

 "Until the next big dick comes along, right?" 

 "Never again Josh, I swear to you never again. I don't know what came over me this time. I can't explain it, but never again." 

 "I don't know Shayna. You are asking an awful lot of me and I don't know that I'm up to handling it. Basically you are asking me to forget that last weekend ever happened, for me to trust you and for life to go on as if nothing was wrong. I don't know that it will even be possible for me to trust you again. I don't know that I'll be able to stand wondering every day if that is going to be the day you decide that you need to have a huge cock again." 

 "I swear to God Josh, never again. It was a huge mistake and I regret it and I promise that it will never happen again." 

 I looked at her and she looked so forlorn that I wanted to take her in my arms and comfort her, but of course I didn't. After several seconds of silence I said: 

 "I've got to think about this Shayna. Like I said, I don't know if I can handle being with someone I can't trust. For now you can have the spare bedroom, but it might be good for you to stay out of my way for a while." 

 "You won't be sorry Josh; I promise you that you won't be sorry." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 I put what was going on with Shayna on the back burner and put my attention on Mr. Craig Mercer. He was going to pay for what he had done, but I was going to have to do it in such a way that I did the maximum damage and still managed to stay out of jail. That meant that I was probably not going to have the satisfaction of seeing his face when he realized just who it was that was fucking him up. I would have dearly loved pound Mercer into a lump of shit spread out on the ground, but it wasn't going to happen. My buddy Joel was serving three to five for "felonious assault" because he fucked up the guy he caught screwing his wife. No, the best I could do was fuck Mercer up as "an unknown assailant" and then later hint to him that what happened to him is what happens to guys who mess with another man's woman. 

 I used some vacation time and followed Mercer around. He didn't seem to have a regular job. He worked as a carpenter, but never at the same place for more than a couple of days. The one constant was that when he got home every night he uncovered his Harley and went riding. 

 On the home front I decided to give Shayna a chance. Maybe not the wisest thing to do, but it is a truism that love is not only blind, but it makes you stupid and it lets you do things that you normally wouldn't even consider. I had her promises, but while I let her come back I didn't take her promises at face value. I think it was Ronald Reagan who said, "Trust, but verify." 

 I had a friend who was heavily into electronics and he told me how to bug the phone in the house. Not hard and most of what I needed to do the job came from Wal-Mart. It was only a token thing though since she could still talk to Mercer while she was at work or talk to him on her cell. Work would be iffy since they frowned on personal calls on company time so she wouldn't likely give him her number there. I had no way of knowing whether she had given him her cell number, but I could check the monthly statements from our cell phone provider. 

 Every night when I got home from work I would go down into the basement and see if the recorder had picked up anything of interest. Shayna had been back home a week when the first call came. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hi ya sweet cheeks. Miss me?" 

 "What do you want Craig?" 

 "The same thing you want sweet cheeks; a weekend of hot sex." 

 "Sorry Craig; not interested." 

 "Sure you are sweet cheeks. You just haven't gotten over feeling guilty yet, but you will. I'll call you again in a couple of days. Think of me sweet cheeks; think of me hard and ready for you." 

 "Don't bother Craig. I'm really not interested." 

 "We will see. Talk to you later sweet cheeks." 

 When I went up to dinner I casually asked Shay how her day had been. 

 "Pretty good until I got home from work." 

 "What happened then?" 

 "Craig called." 

 "And?" 

 "He wants to get together again." 

 "You going to?" 

 "Damn it Josh! I told you never again and I meant it." 

 "Okay, okay, don't get huffy. Don't forget who is the shit on party in this mess. I have a right to ask." 

 The rest of the meal was silent and at bedtime she tried to follow me into the bedroom, but I just pointed at the spare room and she got the message. 

 His next call came two days later. "How you doing sweet cheeks? Ready for some hot sex?" 

 "I told you not to bother me any more." 

 "I know, but you didn't mean it. I've penciled you in for the weekend. Your place or mine?" 

 "It isn't going to happen Craig. The first time was a major mistake and one I'm going to be a long time paying for. It isn't going to happen again. Don't call me any more" and she hung up on him. 

 At dinner that night she didn't mention the call. That night she again tried to follow me into the bedroom and that time I let her. She did her best to destroy me. "I'll make you forget baby, I'll make you forget and I'll keep making you forget for the rest of your life."

 I'd taken one more precaution and I had put a voice actuated cassette recorder under the seat of her car. When I checked it the day after Mercer's second phone call I heard her side of a conversation. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Oh hi." 

 "I miss you too." 

 "Of course not. He is going to be suspicious for a long, long time." 

 "Yes." 

 "If he is taping the phone all he has heard is what we want him to hear. I even told him that you called." 

 "What do you mean how did he take it. He was suspicious. He asked me if I was going to see you again and I denied it rather loudly." 

 "No baby, not any time soon. First I have to convince him that I'm going to be a good little girl." 

 "I want it too baby. I think about it all the time." 

 "No Craig." 

 "Don't be stupid Craig. I will not leave him for you." 

 "Yes baby, I know. I remember each and every one of them and I would love to have more, lots more, but I love Josh and I don't love you." 

 "So what if I'm the best piece of ass you have ever had and you give me the best orgasms ever. I do not love you; I love him and I will never leave him." 

 "Be patient baby. It is going to take a while for me to get to where I can get free without him wondering where I've been. It might take a couple of months, but we will get to do it again." 

 "No. Keep up the fake phone calls to the house in case he is listening. The more I tell you to quit bothering me to quicker he will get around to trusting me." 

 "Okay. Bye baby." 

 It wasn't as if I hadn't been expecting it. I mean face it; something made me tap the house phone and put a recorder in her car. It was time for me to drop my planned restitution on Craig Mercer's head,

 It is nice to have good friends. I told Billy Neubert about my problem and about what I wanted to do and asked him if he had any suggestions and he did. 

 At 7:05 pm Mercer pulled into the apartment complex parking lot and at 8:10 pm he came out of the apartment, uncovered the Harley and rode it out of the lot. I followed along behind far enough back that he wouldn't think anything of it. As we motored along I kept a close watch on my rear view and on the road ahead for oncoming traffic. It was about ten minutes before conditions were right with no traffic behind me and no oncoming traffic ahead. I stepped on the gas, pulled out to pass Mercer and when I was along side him I cut the wheel sharply to the right at fifty miles per hour and slammed into him. He and the Harley went cart wheeling off the road. I stepped on it and drove away. 

 I drove Billy's car to the Safeway parking lot where Stan North picked me up and drove me back to work. Billy had popped to lock out of the steering column of his car and then had driven it to John Marshall's house where he sat down and played poker with six friends until two hours after Mercer's accident. When he got ready to leave he went outside to find that his car had been stolen and he called the police. 

 My alibi was that I was working. No, no one else was there to verify that, but the guard at the front desk signed me out about an hour after Mercer was run off the road. As far as he knew I'd been there until then. He had no way of knowing that I'd left the building through the loading dock where Stan had met me and had driven me over to pick up Billy's car. Mercer couldn't known it was me even if he had looked over as I came up along side of him since I was wearing a ski mask. In any case it didn't matter since the cops never did pay me a visit. Insurance covered the damage to Billy's car and I reimbursed him for the deductable. He also has a huge favor or three coming from me if he ever needs them.

 The next morning I was reading the paper and drinking coffee while Shay was fixing breakfast. 

 "Sweetie?" 

 "Yes." 

 "What was the name of the guy you slipped out with that night?" 

 "Damn it Josh; I thought we had agreed not to mention that anymore." 

 "I know, I know, but it says here in the paper that Craig Mercer was the victim of a hit and run last night and he is in the hospital and in intensive care." 

 "I never told you his name." 

 "You didn't have to. When he brought you by the house one of the neighbors wrote down his plate number and I had a guy I know run it so I could get the assholes name and address." 

 "Josh, you didn't." 

 "Didn't what? Hurt him? Why Shayna? You have feelings for the asshole? You telling me my getting even would upset you?" 

 "No, of course not. I just don't want you to get into any trouble. I fucked up and I'm sorry, but I don't want you out there seeking revenge or trying to get even in some way. I'd die if you got in trouble because of the stupid thing that I did." 

 I didn't say another word on the subject, but the thought had been planted. It wouldn't hurt at all to have her thinking that I could do something like that. 

 ++++++++++++++ 

 Two days after his accident I called to see if Mercer could have visitors. After being told that he could I showed up during visiting hours. I walked into his room and saw that he was in a full body cast. I walked over to the bed, looked down at him and said: 

 "Damn! You must have really pissed somebody off bad." 

 He was a little groggy, probably from pain killers, but he managed to get out a "Who are you?" 

 "You don't recognize me? You mean you can ask a man if you can dance with his wife, take off with her for a weekend and not even remember his face?" 

 "You! You did this to me. You bastard! I'll get you for this." 

 "Sorry asshole, but I don't get the credit for this one. If you ever find out who did do it you can thank him. I planned on taking my revenge on you this weekend. Three of my friends were going to hold you down while I castrated you so whoever did this to you saved your family jewels. At least for now, but you can expect to see me and my three friends when you get out of here and back on your feet. Yes indeed Craig old buddy you will be seeing me again and you aren't going to like it. You aren't going to like it the least little bit. See you around guy." 

 I left him with those thoughts and went on home. Over dinner I told Shayna I had stopped at the hospital to visit Mercer. 

 "I told him to hurry up and get well so I can have my shot at him. I told him he should thank whoever did it to him for saving his family jewels for a while art least." 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "I had it all set up to castrate the bastard this weekend, but now it will have to wait until he gets out of the hospital and gets his strength back." 

 "Are you crazy? You will get yourself tossed in jail." 

 "No I won't. Me and the guys who are going to hold him down while I castrate him will all be wearing ski masks so he won't know who we are. I've got six guys lined up who will swear that I was playing poker when it happened. He will know it was me, but he won't be able to prove a thing." 

 "Don't do it Josh. You will only get yourself in trouble." 

 "I'm beginning to think you have some feelings for this guy and his cock." 

 "I don't. I just don't want to see you go to jail." 

 "You expect me to just take what that asshole did to me? I'm supposed to be some kind of wimp? The asswipe thinks I'm a wimp or he never would have called here after you came home to try and get you to come see him again. I need to do it for my own piece of mind Shayna. Like it or not, you know that my trust in you is not complete. I don't think that you will go out looking for some guy with a huge piece of meat between his legs, but I wouldn't put it past you to go after a guy who you already know has a large one. You will get to thinking of those huge continuous orgasms and you just might decide that you can get away with sneaking off a time or two and if you did that and I found out what I would do to the both of you is something you don't even want to think on.. I'm just going to remove the temptation Shayna. Remove the temptation for you and get some payback for me. You just might want to suggest that he leave the state if he should happen to call you again. I won't go out of state to get him, but I'll damned sure get to him if he stays around here." 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Two years have gone by since Shayna's 'slip in judgment' and there have been some changes. Mercer did decide to practice his free lance carpentry in another state. There were never any more calls to the house and he and Shayna never did talk on her cell phone. This I know because I carefully screen the monthly cell phone statements and I never did remove the recorder from her car. I can't swear that they never talked, but I keep a close eye on Shayna and she has given me no call to be even remotely suspicious.  

 

 ****** Dancing Shayna ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© I did exact a bit of punishment on her and I guess most won't even consider it close to harsh enough, but it does hit her where it hurts. We still go dancing, but I no longer say yes when a guy comes over and asks her to dance. She either dances with me or she doesn't dance at all and since I'm only up to dancing about a third of the tunes played on a normal night out Shayna does a lot more sitting than she does dancing and it kills her. She has complained about it a time or two, but as soon as I remind her of what happened the last time I said yes she shuts right up. Report_Story
