"Joey, can I ask you what sounds like a silly question?" 

 "Sure, as long as you don't mind silly answers." 

 "No Joey, I mean the question is going to sound silly coming from me, but I really want to know the answer." 

 "Okay Aimee, shoot." 

 "Do all black men have really huge dicks?" 

 "Jesus Aimee, how in the hell should I know that?" 

 "Well, you did play sports in high school and college and you were in the Army for three years so I know you have been in a lot of shower rooms with other men." 

 "Yes, but I didn't spend my time in those shower rooms measuring cocks." 

 "But surely you must have noticed something?" 

 "Sorry baby, but checking out dicks just wasn't my thing. What's this all about anyway?" 

 "Judy says that black men have bigger dicks than white men." 

 "Well, there you have it. That slut would know if anyone would." 

 "She's not a slut Joey." 

 "She has had four husbands and everyone of them divorced her for infidelity. She has spread her legs for damned near every man we know and that behavior more than meets the definition of slut as I understand it." 

 "Joey, she is still my best friend so please don't talk about her like that when you are around me." 

 I wondered if Aimee would still talk like that if she knew how many times Judy had tried to get me between her legs. 

 A couple of days went by and one night at dinner Aimee asked, "Can I ask you for a really huge favor?" 

 "I suppose. What do you want?" 

 "The next time couple of times you go to the gym for your work out would you see if maybe you could get a look at a couple of black cocks for me?" 

 "Good God Aimee, what is it with you and cock size all of a sudden?" 

 "I just want to find out if Judy is right." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because I'm curious. You know me Joey, I'm a screaming liberal. I'm out there marching with a sign and protesting like hell anytime there is even a hint of racial injustice. I've always said that blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians or whatever are all the same except for the accident of skin color. Now Judy is telling me that I'm wrong, that there are major differences between the races, that all blacks have bigger cocks. I don't want to believe Judy. We all have to be the same regardless of skin color. I have to know Joey, and I can't go find out for myself. Please Joey, I'm not asking you to take a tape measure with you, just a quick glance and tell me what you see." 

 She worked on me all the way through dinner and into dessert and I finally broke down and told her I would see what I could. I didn't mean it of course, there was no way that I was going to try and scope out cock sizes in a shower room. But even though I wasn't going to snoop in the shower I was going to try and get an answer for her. One of my good friends at work is black and I offered to buy him lunch if he would answer a few stupid sounding personal questions for me. I told him what was going on with Aimee and asked him right out if it was true. 

 "I wish I had a dollar for every white woman who has asked that question, but the answer is no. If you randomly select five hundred white men and five hundred black men you would probably find the same statistical variance in each group. If there were ten very large cocks in the black group you would find nine, ten or eleven very large cocks in the white group. The same could be said for medium sized cocks and small cocks; the percentages would be damned near the same. Your wife's friend probably only sees large black cocks because that is what she goes looking for." 

 "How would she find just big ones?" 

 "She only has to find one on her own. There are more white women out there who want to experience a big black cock than you might believe and like anything in our free market society if there becomes a demand for something someone will find a way to supply that demand. If a white woman finds one black man with a larger than average cock you can be sure that he has made it his business to find others. For some reason black men are hard wired in the brain to want white women so the propensity among black men is to share the white women they get. I'm not talking gangbanging here. Joe meets Mary who is curious about black cock. Joe does Mary and then calls up Bill and tells him that he has a hot white chick who likes black cock and I'll turn her over to you if you have something to trade. Bill puts Joe in touch with Jill and it just goes on like that. Judy could very well have seen a dozen big dicked black studs if that is what she was looking for." 

 That night when I got home Aimee asked me if I had seen anything that she might be interested in knowing. I told her that I'd seen a few things, but that I was going to watch for a week or so to get a good sample. Over the next two weeks I went to the gym seven times and on the seventh day I came home I told her that statistically there was no difference between the black race and the white race, at least in the cock department. I told her I had seen three large black cocks and four white ones about the same size, eight black and eight white ones about the same size as mine, and two small black and three small white ones. I could see the relief on her face and I said, "Press on Liberal Lady; fight racial injustice secure in the knowledge that we are all just folks with different skin colors." 

 A couple of months went by and I began to notice some things. Aimee seemed to be quieter and she spent a lot of time seeming to look off into the distance. We didn't talk as much at the dinner table as we used to and a couple of times I came home from work to find her lying on our bed crying. When I asked what was wrong she would just say that she wasn't feeling well. Our sex life started to slack off. From five and six times a week to four and then two or three and then two weeks without any and always the same answer, "I'm just not feeling well Joey." Then one night I came home from work to find a note on the kitchen table: 

 "Joey, I love you, I really, really do, but I can't live with you any more. I'm sorry, Aimee 

 Frantic, I called her mother, her brother, her two sisters and anyone else I could think of to se if anyone knew where she might be, but no one knew a thing. Finally I thought of Judy. I called her and she said, "She's here Joey, but she doesn't want to talk to you." 

 "Why not?" 

 "She has her reasons. Not good ones as far as I'm concerned, but they seem to work for her." 

 "What the hell is going on Judy? She can't just walk out on me without a word, without telling me what is wrong. What the hell did I do?" 

 "You didn't do anything Joey. She did and it is killing her." 

 "Come on Judy, give - what the hell is going on?" 

 "Look Joey, I like you, I like you a lot. I think you are one of the nice guys, but I can't tell you a thing. You will have to get it from her. I will tell you this though, and don't you dare let her know you got it from me, but she plans on going to the house tomorrow to get some clothes while you are at work." 

 I called in sick the next morning, went out and moved my car around the block and then I went back into the house and waited. It was a long wait and I was starting to think that Judy had given me bad information when Aimee's car pulled into the drive. I moved to where she couldn't see me until she was well into the house and I could get between her and the door. Aimee came in the front door and went straight up the stairs and into our bedroom. I gave her a minute and then I followed her up. I went into the room, closed the door and then sat down on the floor with my back to it and waited to be noticed. Aimee backed out of the closet with an arm full of clothes and turned to drop them on the bed and then that's when she saw me. "What are you doing here?" 

 "I live here." 

 "That's not what I mean. You are supposed to be at work." 

 "I wasn't feeling good so I called in sick." 

 "Have you called the doctor?" 

 "It's not that kind of not feeling well. I got some news last night that kind of put me down in the dumps." 

 "Oh, I see," she said and she turned and dropped the clothes. 

 "What is going on here Aimee?" 

 "Please Joey, I don't want to talk about it." 

 "Unfortunately for you Aimee, I do, so you are going to have to whether you want to or not." 

 "Joey, will you just please leave. Don't make this any harder on either of us than it has to be." 

 "I'm not leaving Aimee, until I know what this is all about, and neither are you. There are only two ways out of this room, through the window or through the door, so unless you plan on jumping out of a second floor window the only way out is through the door and I'm not moving until you talk." 

 "Please Joey, I don't want to talk about it, it will only make things worse." 

 "Worse for who Aimee? How can it be any worse for me than it already is? The woman I love walks out on me without a word and I'm supposed to sit here with an over-active imagination to try and figure out why? I'm supposed to sit here, stare at the walls and think all kinds of things like maybe you left me for another man? You left me for another woman or you didn't leave me for anyone else, you just can't stand me any more? Then I could go way out there and imagine you over at Judy's taking part in orgies'" and when I said that I saw Aimee wince. 

 "That's it. I can see by your face, that's it. Judy finally corrupted you. That's why our sex life died; you are getting all you need over at Judy's. That's probably the real reason for your interest in the size of black cocks, right? You were trying to talk yourself into trying a couple and stupid me was your point man. Is it just one black man you are leaving me for, or is it a herd of them? Have you become as big a slut as Judy? Never mind, I don't really want to know the answer to that." 

 I got up from the floor and left the room. As I was heading down the stairs I heard Aimee call out, "Wait Joey, don't go" but I continued on down the stairs and left the house. 

 I got in my car and headed into work. I hadn't been there an hour when I got a phone call from Judy. 

 "You asshole! What did you do to her? She's over here bawling her eyes out and I can't get her to stop." 

 "Whoa up there lady. How did I get to be the bad guy here? I come home to find that she's left me. I was at the house when she got there and she wouldn't talk to me and so I left the house and came to work. That makes me an asshole?" 

 "Okay, so I'm sorry I called you an asshole. She wouldn't talk?" 

 "Not a word." 

 "It isn't my place to do this, but if she won't then I guess I'll have to. Buy me lunch at Anton's and I'll fill you in." 

 She was already there when I arrived and as I walked up to the table I thought, and not for the first time, about how sexy she looked. I suppose that might have had something to do with her being such a cock hungry slut. If you got hit on as often as she probably was it would be easy to get laid as often as you wanted. She had already ordered drinks and there was one sitting there waiting for me when I sat down. She pointed at it and said, "You need to hurry sweetie, I'm on my third and you might need to play catch up. A few drinks in you might make this go easier." 

 I took a sip of the drink and then set it down. "No games Judy, just tell me what the hell is going on." 

 "You haven't heard my terms yet sweetie. Do you want to know bad enough to take me home with you and give me a taste?" 

 "Yes, I want to know that bad, but no I won't. Is that what this little meeting is all about? You trying to get me in the sack?" 

 "No sweetie, but you can't blame a girl for trying. I've always wanted to see what it is that is so special about you that Aimee never shuts up about you." 

 "Maybe you can ask her now that she doesn't care any more." 

 "Don't even think that for a minute sweetie. Aimee loves you as much now as she ever did. She just can't face you. Your wife was bad sweetie, very, very bad, and now she has a guilty conscience. . She betrayed you and the thought of having to face you every day after what she did is tearing her apart. She has managed to convince herself that you would be better off with her not around." 

 "Just what is it that she did that was so bad?" 

 "She got laid sweetie, not just once, but several times and not by just one guy either." 

 "Aimee?" 

 "Yes sweetie, Aimee got herself fucked by seven different guys over a three day period and when it was over she hated herself for being so weak and abusing your trust and now she is beating herself up over it." 

 "You let that happen to her?" 

 "No sweetie, I just didn't stop it. Why should I have? I thought it was what she wanted. I thought that she had wanted it for a long time, but wasn't going to do it until you did it first." 

 "I'm sorry, but you lost me on that one." 

 "Sweetie, I'm a cock hungry slut and you know it. I'll fuck anyone who has a cock attached to him. I make no apology sweetie; I am what I am and what's more I love being what I am. Aimee is my best friend and I've known her a hell of a lot longer than you have. Do you really think that given how close I am to Aimee that I would try to hustle her husband behind her back? No way sweetie. Aimee pointed me at you and turned me loose." 

 "I don't believe you." 

 "Believe it or not sweetie it is still true. Did you know that your wife considers you a bit of a tight ass? One day I was asking her what was so great about being married to you and she said to me, her exact words sweetie, "Why don't you take him to bed and see for yourself. He could use a little loosening up." I said, "You wouldn't mind?" and she said, "Hell no girlfriend, it would only be sex and I know he loves me." That's when I started taking shots at you and I honestly thought that what she was really after was a chance to go out and play a little on the wild side, but she needed you to stray so she would have an excuse. It turns out I was wrong about that. She honestly felt that you needed to loosen up a bit and she wanted her best friend to do it rather than some stranger. So, when Aimee let loose I thought it was just because she got tired of waiting for you to go first so I didn't do anything to stop her." 

 "So just what exactly is it that she did?" 

 It had happened when I was out of town on a four-day business trip and it was just after I had given Aimee the cock size report. She and Judy had spent the day shopping and then they had stopped at a lounge for a few drinks and then they had gone back to Judy's and had several more. Then Judy had suggested that Aimee should be getting along home and Aimee had asked why Judy was in a hurry to get rid of her. Judy told her that Tyrone, her current boyfriend, would be there in about thirty minutes and she didn't think that Aimee wanted to be around when Judy rode his huge black cock. That led to a conversation on cock size and Aimee told Judy about my little survey. Judy told Aimee that I didn't know what I was talking about. More talk and a couple of more drinks and suddenly Tyrone was there and Judy drug him into the conversation. He of course said yes, all black men have larger cocks than white men. A couple of more drinks and then Judy said she would settle it once and for all and she made a few phone calls. 

 An hour later there were five black men at Judy's place and Judy had them all strip and stand in front of Aimee. The smallest cock in the bunch was nine inches and the biggest had been twelve and a quarter. Aimee sat on the couch looking from one to the other and shaking her head in amazement. Judy had grabbed Tyrone by the hand and had taken him into the bedroom and when they came out twenty minutes later it was just in time to see one man get off of Aimee and another one get on. Judy had no idea how Aimee had let it happen, but it was obvious that Aimee wasn't being forced. The men had picked Aimee up and had carried her into the bedroom and then she and Judy had spent the rest of the night being rotated among the men. The next morning Judy woke up to a crying Aimee, torn with guilt, upset over what had happened and at a loss as to how could ever face me again. 

 To cheer Aimee up Judy took her shopping again and again they stopped at a lounge for drinks only that time they stayed until closing and Judy had allowed them to get picked up by two black men. Judy's intention had been to drop Aimee off at our house and then take the two black men back to her place, but when they got to our house one of the guys asked if he could come in long enough to use the bathroom. They stuck around for a drink or two and then they all ended up in bed together. In the morning Aimee had said, "Well, I've fucked up my marriage and my life, but at least I was able to disprove a myth. Both those guys had cocks half the size of Joey's." 

 They had gone shopping again and that night had gone to Judy's place where Aimee had attempted to drown her sorrows with alcohol. Tyrone showed up and a little latter a couple of the other men from the first night had shown up and it turned into another group grope on the bed. 

 "The next morning Aimee went home and as far as I know she hasn't seen another man since. I do know that she was a big hit with the guys and they keep after me to bring her back. I know that several keep calling her and asking her to go out and that she always says no." 

 "So what do I do now?" 

 "Depends on what you want sweetie. Are you a big enough man and do you love her enough to forgive her or is this something that would always be between you and eat at you if you got back together?" 

 "I don't know the answer to that one Judy. I honestly don't know." 

 "Well sweetie, answering that question is the first step in deciding what you are going to do." 

 "What do you think I should do?" 

 "You are asking me that? The girl with four ex-husbands? That's a little like asking Attila The Hun for advice on setting up peace talks." 

 I suffered through a very bad three days. I talked to Judy every day to make sure that Aimee was okay and on the third day it occurred to me that I wouldn't be talking to Judy if I didn't care about Aimee. The next step was to admit to myself that I loved her and was miserable without her, but I was also honest enough with myself to admit that I did know the answer to Judy's question. What Aimee did would always be between us and it would always fester like a picked at sore. I spent another two days beating my head against the wall trying to figure out what to do. The only thing I could think of was shaky at best, but it was all I could come up with so I called Judy. 

 "What you thought Aimee wanted, do you think it would work in reverse?" 

 "What work in reverse?" 

 "You thought she wanted you to bed me so she would be free to play. Would our going to bed now have the same effect? You know, the old "You did and now I did and so we are even?" 

 "Oh no sweetie. It might work, but not with me. Six weeks ago I would have jumped at the chance and been in your bed in a heartbeat, but not now. Aimee is an emotional mess and I'm not going to risk my friendship with her on a maybe." 

 My only shot and it was shot down. Suddenly I knew what I had to do. It was a long shot and if it didn't work Aimee and I were history. I picked the phone back up and called Judy again. 

 "Remember how that first night happened?" 

 "Yes." 

 "I want you to take Aimee shopping again. 

 When Judy answered the door she said, "Are you sure that you want to do this?" 

 "I have to do it. If I walk away Aimee and I are toast. If I go through with it I at least have a fifty-fifty chance we can save things." 

 "On your head be it sweetie" and she stepped aside and let me in. 

 "Did it work?" 

 She led me to the bedroom, stepped aside and said, "See for yourself." 

 On the bed a very naked Aimee was on her hands and knees and being fucked by a black man while two other black men stood by the bed watching and waiting their turn.

"It took a lot more booze that I thought it would, but it worked. That's Tyrone in the saddle and the other two are Sam and Wendell. They all know what the score is, good luck." 

 On the bed Tyrone said, "Next up get ready, I'm almost there." 

 "That would be me," I said as I started shedding clothes. 

 Judy walked over to the other two and took them by the hand, "Come on. I'll do you guys in the living room and you can come back for some of her later." 

 Tyrone gave a grunt as he drove into Aimee and spilled his seed in her cunt and then he moved out of the way and I took his place. I pushed my cock into her as hard as I could and then I said, "First time I've ever gotten sloppy seconds from my wife." 

 She twisted her head and looked back at me and cried out, "No, you can't, you can't see me like this, oh God, not like this." 

 "Too late my little cock crazy slut. I'm already in and I'm not leaving until I've cum in your whorish cunt as many times as I can. If you can gangbang black men you can damned sure fuck your husband. At least he loves you for more than your pussy." 

 She kept crying, "No, no, no" and trying to get away from me, but I wasn't going to go anywhere until the night was over. Eventually the "No, no, no," turned into "I'm sorry, I'm sorry" and then the "I'm sorry"s turned into the sounds that I had grown used to hearing during our nine years of marriage - "Oh yes, oh yes, oh God yes." From then on until I fell asleep exhausted I took turns on my wife with the other three men. 

 When I woke up in the morning I heard Aimee and Judy whispering. 

 "You have to do it." 

 "I can't Aimee, you know I can't." 

 "Please Judy, do it for me please? Somebody has to do it or I'll never feel right. He showed me that he loves and will forgive me by what he did last night, but I still have to forgive myself. I've had others and he hasn't. Take care of that for me, please?" 

 "What should I do?" 

 "He loves to wake up to a blow job. When he gets hard climb on top and ride him and he'll take it from there. Keep him here all day and all night." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "Go home and get ready for his home-coming." 

 I heard footsteps leave the room and then a hot mouth captured me. 

 That was five years ago and as far as I know Aimee hasn't touched a cock other than mine since that night at Judy's although on occasion, when I've pissed her off, she mutters something about calling Tyrone. When she does I just say, "Tell him to bring Judy with him" and things seem to mellow out. Five years ago I wouldn't have given us a chance in hell of still being together, but we are and I think our marriage is stronger than it has ever been. Proof, at least to me, that love can find a way if you are willing to try. Report_Story
