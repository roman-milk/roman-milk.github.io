 ****** Apartment 3B Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© I looked at her on the other side of the table and realized that she had not changed a bit in the year since I had last seen her. I saw her looking me over and wondered what she was thinking. I had honestly never expected to see her again. 

 I had checked into the motel three hours before and then had gone to the attached restaurant to get a bite to eat. I was sitting in a booth going over my schedule for the coming week when someone slid onto the seat across from me and said: 

 "Hello stranger; long time no see." 

 I looked up and saw Connie. She had been the afternoon desk clerk at the motel for as long as I had been coming to Palm Springs. 

 "Hello yourself. How have you been?" 

 "Same old same old. Still working the desk, but now I have the day shift with Saturday and Sunday off. How's that for being in tall cotton? You alone or is the crew here." 

 I knew what she wanted to hear. She and Sam had a thing going every time he came to the Springs. 

 "Alone for two days and then Vern, Rick and Billy Bob will be here." 

 I saw her face start to fall and then said, "And Sam will be here too." 

 She smiled at me and said "Bastard." 

 I smiled back at her and said, "Yup, that's me." 

 "How long this time?" 

 "Supposed to be three weeks but you know how that goes. The last time was only supposed to be two weeks and we were here two and a half months." 

 "Been here long?" 

 "About three hours." 

 "Seen anyone else?" 

 "No. Checked in, called the office to let them know I was here and then came here." 

 She was silent for a second or two and then said, "She's working across the street. She tends bar in the afternoon at the Oasis. She's there now. She works three-thirty to midnight." 

 I shrugged and Connie said, "She finally got rid of Nick. 

 I looked at her as what she said hit home. 

 "No replacement either." 

 "Excuse me" I said and I went to the pay phone, opened the phone book and found what I was looking for and then made the call. A credit card number took care of it and a dozen red roses were on the way. I went back to the booth and asked Connie not to go over to the Oasis and say anything. 

 Her back was to me when I entered the Oasis at ten to twelve. I took a seat at the end of the bar and waited while she finished taking care of a customer. She turned and took a bill to the register and then took the guy his change. Then she turned and checked out the rest of the bar to see if anyone was ready for another drink and she saw me. Her face lit up in a smile and she headed for me. As she passed by the register she stopped and took a rose out of the vase sitting there and then came up to me. 

 "There was no card, but my heart told me who sent them." 

 She looked at her watch and said, "I get off at twelve." 

 "I'll be sitting right here waiting." 

 --------------------------------- 

 I'd met Kirby almost two years before when the company I worked for sent me to Palm Springs for an extended stay. My company handles specialty cars for a major automobile manufacturer and one of the things we did was haul their products to sunny locations so advertising agencies could take the photos and shoot the film that was used in advertising campaigns. Time was money to those people so their locations were almost always in places where you could count on sunshine three hundred and sixty days a year so we did a lot of work in southern California. 

 There were five of us in the crew on that trip and during our second week Vern hooked up with a cocktail waitress who worked at one of the night spots in Rancho Mirage. He would drive over there every night and wait for her to get off work and he kept after the rest of us to go with him so he wouldn't have to drink alone. 

 One night the entire crew decided to go. The place had a floor show that wasn't too bad and Vern's squeeze was a nice looking lady, but from the moment I walked through the door I only had eyes for Kirby. There was just something about her that grabbed me. We were seated in her section and when she came to take our drink order she smiled and I melted. The first thing I saw when I was able to tear my gaze away from her face was the wedding ring on her left hand. I had one too, but mine didn't mean anything. Kirby took our drink order and as she walked away Billy Bob nudged me with his elbow and told me to close my mouth. 

 "Was I that obvious?" 

 "Only to everyone in the building." 

 For the rest of the night I tried to keep up with the conversation as my eyes followed Kirby everywhere she went. The next night I was there with Vern again and again my eyes stayed on Kirby. It made no sense since I knew she was married and to me that meant that she was untouchable, but God did I love looking at her. Vern noticed and asked me if I was planning on taking a shot at her and I told him no. 

 "In all our years working road trips and locations together have you ever seen me cheat on my wife?" 

 "No, but there s always a first time for everything and it is obvious that Kirby has your undivided attention." 

 "She's married too Vern." 

 "Again hoss, a first time for everything." 

 The truth of the matter was that if Kirby wasn't married I would have been after her in a heartbeat and the fact that I had never cheated on my wife would have been history. My fidelity toward Carol was just something that I did because I was an old fashioned kind of guy. I took a vow when I married Carol and unlike some I held to those vows. I didn't have to because as far as I was concerned Carol had released me from those vows, but like I said, I was an old fashioned kind of guy and I had old fashion values. 

 ------------------------ 

 I had been on a two week location with the Grey Advertising Agency at the Kentucky Derby where they were shooting an ad campaign for a new model. Things went smoothly and we finished two days early so I loaded the two cars into the trailer and headed for home. 

 I tried to call Carol and let her know I was on the way home, but got no answer. I didn't think anything of it because she had a whole host of things she did to keep her busy while I was away on location. In addition to working full time at a real estate agency she bowled two nights a week, belonged to a book discussion group at the library, sold Amway products and worked as a volunteer at a local church. No problem. If I couldn't reach her I would surprise her. 

 I dropped the truck at the shop, got into my pick up and headed for the house. I had to drive through town to get home and as I passed by Kelly's Bar I caught sight of Carol's Mustang. No mistaking her pony, it was the only Sea Mist Green Mustang in the county. I hung a u-turn to go back and just as I straightened out the truck I saw Carol come out of Kelly's arm in arm with some guy I had never seen before. I pulled to the curb and watched as they walked – still arm in arm – to the parking lot. They walked to Carol's car and the guy took her in his arms and kissed her and she put her arms around him and kissed him back. She got in her car, started it up and then sat there waiting until the guy got in his car and pulled out of the lot. Carol pulled out behind him and they headed east. Our house was to the west. 

 I pulled out and followed them. I wasn't worried about being noticed since there were thousands of black Ford F-250 pick up trucks around. About five minutes down the road they pulled into an apartment complex, got out of their cars and went into apartment 3B. I saw the lights come on and I sat there to see what would happen next. Forty-five minutes later the lights went off and when no one came out of the apartment during the next hour I knew all I needed to know. 

 I drove home and I could tell as soon as I walked into the house that there hadn't been anyone there in days. I took a look around and then I went to bed. Carol was sure going to be surprised when she got home. 

 Carol wasn't home when I got up in the morning. I ran around and did some errands before I went into work and as I drove through town I saw Carol's Mustang parked at the real estate agency where she worked. I went into work, turned in my expense reports and told my boss I needed to take the rest of the day off to take care of some personal business. 

 I called Carol at work and acted like nothing was wrong. 

 "I called you last night, but I guess you were out." 

 "Last night I was working with the group from church. Are you still going to be home tomorrow?" 

 "Probably not. It looks more like noon the day after." 

 "Damn it honey, you need to get home. I'm hurting." 

 "It is just as bad for me lover." 

 "Just hurry up and get home." 

 "I will. Love you." 

 "Love you too baby." 

 At five I was parked where I could see her car and when she came out of work she was walking with the same guy I'd seen her with the night before only this time they weren't walking arm in arm. Must not want to get the rest of the folks in the office talking. 

 I followed them and they went straight to the apartment. I sat there about and hour and no one came out. I left and went to get a bite to eat and when I came back both cars were still there. I watched for another two hours and no one came out. I went home and set the clock for five am. I didn't expect Carol to come home that night and I planned on being outside 3B when she and the guy came out. I tagged along behind them as they drove to the real estate office and then I headed on into work. I had a sit down with my boss and told him what was going on and that I needed one more day off. 

 I drove home and removed all traces of my having been there and then I drove over to the real estate office. I was behind them when they pulled up in front of 3B and after they went into the apartment I went over to the mail box cluster and found that 3B was occupied by Jason Monroe. I sat and watched and at eleven-thirty Carol came out, got in her car and drove to our house. I headed for a motel and checked in for the night. 

 At ten the next morning I went home and saw that Carol had set the scene for me. Dirty dishes in the sink, her clothes all over the place and the bathroom looking like fifteen people had used it for the last week. It must have taken her hours getting the place to look like she spent all of her time there. 

 I waited until noon and then called her and told her I was home. She told me to take a handful of vitamins and she would try and get off work early. She came rushing in the door at three and she was already pulling off her clothes when she saw me sitting on the couch. 

 "What? You aren't naked and waiting?" 

 "I didn't expect you for another hour." 

 "I told you I would try and get off early. Now come on baby and get with the program. We have a lot of catching up to do." 

 I was not at all happy with Carol, but she was a great piece of ass and now that I knew what I knew that is all she would ever be to me from that point on. I'd had two days to think on it and had decided to just turn my back on it. I needed someone to watch the house when I was gone and it was nice to have home cooked meals. I sucked at doing laundry. The last time I did it I didn't separate it right and everything white came out pink so what the hell I thought, I'd keep Carol as a live in maid while I was gone and a convenient cum depository when I was at home. It would be easier and cheaper than divorcing her cheating ass. 

 "Come on Rob" she cried, "Get with it." 

 I got up, undressed and she grabbed me by the hand and pulled me toward the bedroom. 

 --------------------------------- 

 I was home for two months and as far as I know – and I watched her like a hawk – she never played around on me. I saw no signs that she was unhappy with me and in fact she was very attentive to me and our sex life was great. 

 Then I was tagged for a shoot in Phoenix with the J. Walter Thompson agency and I told Carol I would be leaving on Tuesday. Actually I was leaving on Wednesday and Tuesday evening I was parked just up the street from the real estate office at quitting time and when she got off work at five she and Jason went straight to apartment 3B. I guess they had some catching up to do. 

 That set the pattern for the next year and a half. Carol was the perfect wife when I was home, but as soon as I was out the door she was with Monroe. I would tell her I was leaving a day earlier than I did and then watch as she went to 3B and I would tell her I would be home two days later than I actually got there and then watch as she spent her nights at 3B. 

 I don't guess that she ever worried about not being home when I called because I didn't call all that much. It was something that we had set up long before I found out about her and Monroe. I couldn't call her when I was working the location during the day and it was usually seven-thirty or eight before we lost daylight and packed up the shoot. Because of the three hour time difference between us I didn't want to call and wake her up so we set it up that I would call her every Friday night at ten o'clock her time. She was always there for the call, but whether or not she was alone or not I never knew. 

 I was surprised that she never did anything at our place – at least she never did when I was watching – but I don't know about other nights. What I did know was that our marriage was dead. I would continue to use her, but it would never be any more than that. 

 --------------------------------- 

 It was my habit when on trips to live off my per diem and bank my entire paycheck, but finding out about Carol's secret life changed that. I started banking my per diem in an account Carol didn't know about and started pulling my travel expenses out of my paycheck. A divorce would happen somewhere along down the line and since divorces were now mostly no-fault with assets being split fifty-fifty I intended to decrease the amount of cash Carol would get while increasing what I would end up with. Carol noticed the change in bank deposits and mentioned it and I explained it away by telling her that the cost of motel rooms and meals kept going up, but my per diem didn't so I had to make up the difference. 

 The other change was that I started volunteering for more trips. By the time I first laid eyes on Kirby my marriage was long gone even though Carol didn't know it. Probably the oddest part was that even though Carol had broken her vows to me and that should have freed me up to play I didn't. Those old fashioned values again. I had given my word when I said "I do" and I was stuck with it until the bands of matrimony were legally severed. That was my mind set. 

 Until I set eyes on Kirby. 

 But Kirby was married so all I could do was look and not touch. And look I did. Three or four nights a week I went to the club and sat with Vern while he waited for Linda to get off work and I pretended to watch the floor show while all the time watching Kirby move between tables and wait on customers. 

 I did talk to her occasionally. When things were slow she and Linda would come over to the table and we would talk, but it was mostly general conversation. I don't know how long it would have gone on like that if left up to me, but it wasn't left up to me. 

 It was a Saturday night and the entire crew was there. Billy Bob had hooked up with a girl who had come down to the Springs for the weekend; Sam had somehow latched onto Connie who was the girl who worked the front desk at the motel and Rick was with one of the waitresses from the restaurant at the motel. I flagged Kirby down and ordered a round for the table and when she brought it I dropped two twenties on her tray and told her to keep the change. She bent down and kissed me and then said: 

 "Are we still on for tonight?" 

 I was caught totally by surprise, but I'm fairly quick on my feet so I said, "Absolutely." 

 As Kirby walked away Vern said, "You old dog you. How did you manage that without any of us knowing? Hell bud, we are with you almost all the time and I never had a clue." 

 "I guess I never told you that my nick-name in school was "Slick" did I?" 

 "No you didn't old hoss, but I can see that you are. Yes indeed you are." 

 About half an hour later I got up to use the bathroom and when I came out Kirby was waiting in the hall for me. 

 "The restaurant at the motel a little after midnight okay?" 

 Before I could say a word she turned and hurried back to work. I looked at my watch and saw that it would be two hours before I could find out what was going on. I went back to the table but I can't for the life of me remember anything that was said by the others sitting there. I watched Kirby work and wondered what the hell was going on. 

 It was a quarter after twelve when Kirby walked in and saw me sitting in a booth. "Surprised?" she asked as she slid onto the sear across from me. 

 "Stunned is more like it. What is going on? Why did you make everyone at the table think that there is something going on between us?" 

 "Wouldn't you like for there to be something going on between us? From the way you watch me I certainly get that impression." 

 "Look lovely lady, I'm just a simple mechanic and truck driver and I have to have things explained to me. What is going on here?" 

 "I need a boyfriend and if you are willing you are my choice." 

 "You are married sweetie so why are you looking for a boyfriend?" 

 "It isn't all that complicated. My husband Nick travels a lot for his job. He is gone two and three weeks at a time and I spend a lot of time being alone and horny. But I love Nick so I sit home and suffer through it and wait for him to come home. A couple of months ago I found out that Nick gets horny also, but he doesn't suffer through it and wait until he gets home to me." 

 "He is cheating on you?" 

 "Big time. His trips take him to San Francisco, Salt Lake, Denver and Kansas City on a regular basis and he has a steady girlfriend in each one of those places. In places he goes to where he doesn't have a steady he is always hitting bars and lounges looking for pick ups." 

 "And you know this how?" 

 "Private detectives." 

 "You make enough as a cocktail waitress to hire private detectives?" 

 "Not hardly, but my dad is loaded and he paid for it. What happened is that Nick came home from one of his trips and got a little careless. I took some of his clothes to the dry cleaners and I went through the pockets to make sure that there was nothing in them. I found a package of condoms. Nick and I have never used condoms so right away I knew what it meant. 

 "My dad is a divorce lawyer and I went to him for advice. Not divorce advice because I loved Nick, but I wanted to know from my father's standpoint and experience what the chances were that Nick and I could work things out. Like how many cases he had been involved in that didn't go all the way to divorce and why they didn't. That kind of stuff. He told me that condoms had many other uses other than being used in sexual intercourse and it was possible that Nick used them for another reason. 

 "I was a bit skeptical, but dad told me that he used them to keep his cigarettes and matches dry when he went fishing and sometimes when he played golf and it looked like it might rain. I asked him if he really expected me to believe that and he told me that he played golf in a tee shirt and shorts and the only place he could put his cigarettes was on the tray across the front of the golf cart where they would get wet when it rained or if the sprinklers came on when they weren't supposed to. He used a condom to keep them dry. He suggested that I do nothing, but to keep a close eye on Nick to see if I could come up with anything else." 

 "Your dad was right about them being used for other purposes. When I was in the Army I used them to blouse my trousers, keep water out of the barrel of my rifle and to keep some things dry when we were on marches in bad weather."  

 

 ****** Apartment 3B Ch. 01 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "None of that matters now. What dad didn't tell me was that he was going to use his contacts to find out if Nick was cheating on me and he found out that Nick was." 

 "So what does that have to do with me?" 

 "I decided that I'm not going to sit home and be horny while waiting for Nick to come home. I need some one to help me with the horny part and I picked you." 

 "Why me?" 

 "Because you are a nice guy. I can tell from the way you watch me that you want me, but you haven't tried anything. No sexist remarks, no crude come ons, no trying to grab a feel or pat me on the ass like most of the assholes that come into the lounge. I wanted some one, but most of the guys I come across are assholes and I don't want to waste time on an asshole. I asked Linda to pump Vern about you and Vern told her that you were Mr. Straight Arrow and married so you looked and didn't touch. 

 "Linda also found out that your company will fly your wife out to visit after you have been away from home for over thirty days, but you have never brought her out. You also never talk about her and f anyone asks about her you change the subject. I put all that information together and came up with the idea that all is not well between you and your wife. As for what happened at the lounge tonight Linda suggested that I hit you with it in front of every one so you wouldn't be likely to turn me down without giving me a chance to talk to you so I gambled and here we are." 

 "I don't think I would be a good boyfriend for you. I only get out here three or four times a year and when I am here it is only for a few weeks at a time." 

 "That will work for me. Unfortunately I love Nick even though he is a cheating asshole. I don't plan on leaving him, just play a little while he is playing. If I hooked up with some one local and saw him all the time things could get awkward. Some one who is only around part of the time would be perfect." 

 "What would you do on those horny nights when I wasn't around?" 

 "Remember how good it was when you were here and how good it will be when you come back." 

 "It is a very tempting offer." 

 "I had hoped that it would be. If you are at all interested I believe that you have a room here in this very establishment." 

 "I do indeed. Any chance you might like to go with me to my room and look at my etchings?" 

 "Ooh, I've always wanted to see etchings." 

 I signaled for the bill, paid it and then Kirby and I headed for my room. Once inside my room Kirby said: 

 "I don't see any etchings." 

 "I lied. I just told you that to get you into my room." 

 "Well honey, you got me up here to show me something so you had better get to it." 

 "Show you something? Okay." 

 I walked over to the dresser and started picking up things. "This is my hairbrush and over here we have the charger for my electric razor." I opened the top drawer of the dresser and took out a pair of briefs and showed them to her as I said, "And here is some of my clean underwear." 

 "Enough! Enough already. I've seen enough. Get your pants off. Now!" 

 As she said that her skirt hit the floor and I figured that it was time to get with the program. Kirby was naked and on the bed by the time I had all of my clothes off. She gave me the eye and said: 

 "Get over here lover and show me that I know how to pick 'em." 

 I warned her that the first time might be kind of disappointing as it had been a bit since I'd last been laid and she said: 

 "No problem as long as there is a second time." 

 There was and a third time after which I asked her what time she had to leave and go home. 

 "Trying to get rid of me already?" 

 "Hell no. As far as I'm concerned you can stay right here until the location is over and even then you can stay with me. Just get in the truck and go home with me." 

 "You sound like you mean that." 

 "Bet your sweet ass I do." 

 "What would you tell your wife when you got me there?" 

 "Get out and don't let the door hit your ass on the way out." 

 "Ouch! That sounds a bit harsh." 

 "I suppose it does, but our marriage has been over for a couple of years now. I just haven't taken the time to put it to rest." 

 "Well sweetie, it won't end because of little old me going home with you because that is never going to happen. I will have my fun with you, but I'm staying here because this is where Nick is when he is not on the road selling. But to answer your question; I need to be home by one-thirty so I can shower and get ready to go into work at four." 

 "That means you can have breakfast with me." 

 "You might not have enough energy left to get out of bed to go to breakfast" she said as she reached for my cock and when her mouth closed on me I felt like I'd died and gone to Heaven. 

 ------------------------------ 

 The two week location stretched out to five and for the next eight days Kirby spent her nights in my bed and on the ninth night Kirby told me that her husband had gotten home that afternoon so it would be a while before she would be able to see me again. 

 The next two nights I went with Vern to the lounge and sat with him while he waited for Linda to get off, but seeing Kirby and knowing that she wouldn't be going back to my room with me was just too hard on me so I stopped going to the lounge. Three days went by and one afternoon Vern told me that Kirby had asked about me and was wondering if I was okay. 

 "Tell her I'm fine." 

 "You tell her." 

 "I can't. I don't have her phone number." 

 "Then come down to the lounge and tell her in person." 

 "Can't do that either. Just tell her I'm fine Vern and then let it rest." 

 A week went by and then one night during the fourth week of the location there was a knock on my door and I opened it expecting to see Vern, Billy Bob or one of the other guys on the crew, but there stood Kirby. 

 "May I come in?" 

 I stepped aside and she walked in. I closed the door and turned to see her taking off her clothes. 

 "Nick is gone for at least two weeks. Get your clothes off lover; we need to make up for lost time." 

 I had a week and a half with Kirby and then it was time to load up the trucks and head home to Michigan. Kirby and I had breakfast together on the morning I had to leave and as we held hands across the table she asked: 

 "You will miss me won't you?" 

 "Silly girl, of course I'm going to miss you. I just wish there was some way I could either stay here or take you with me." 

 "That is so sweet of you to say that, but you know I can't go with you. My heart is here. I will think about you and hope that you will be back soon." 

 She walked me to my truck, gave me a scorcher of a kiss and then walked over to her car. She sat there and watched me until I pulled out of the parking lot and headed east. 

 -------------------------------- 

 Keeping to the schedule I had already set I got home two days before Carol expected me and checked out the house. It had that same empty feeling that I had felt the first time. It was obviously not lived in. That evening I followed Carol and the shithead from the real estate office to dinner and then to a lounge where they danced for a while. They were at Monroe's apartment by one. The next day they skipped dinner and went straight from work to 3B. I guess they wanted to 'stock up' for a while since I was coming home. 

 When I rolled in the house had a 'lived in look' that must have taken Carol hours to achieve. My home coming was passionate as Carol tried to fuck me to death. I was home for almost three months and I kept a close eye on Carol and as far as I could tell she did not run around on me even once. Apparently she and Monroe had figured out that the best way to keep from being caught was not to do anything when I was in town. 

 I was tapped for another trip and as was my new habit I told Carol I was leaving a day earlier than I actually left and I was watching as she and Monroe raced from the real estate office to apartment 3B. I was punishing myself a little by doing that, but I needed to know if she was still with Monroe or had switched to some other asshole. 

 My trip didn't take me to Palm Springs. It was an inside location at a studio in Century City in Los Angeles that was scheduled for three days and then I had to take the car to San Diego for five days and then head up to San Francisco for six more. At the end of the first day's shoot I drove like crazy from LA to Rancho Mirage and it just happened that Kirby was looking in the direction of the door when I walked in. She was so surprised that she dropped her tray. I took a seat and Linda came up to me and asked me if Vern was with me and I had to tell her no. Seconds later Kirby came up to take my drink order. 

 "Are we on for tonight?" I asked and she said that she would try to get off early. I was waiting for her when she came outside at eleven. 

 "Can we do more than hug, kiss and talk?" 

 "Nick left two days ago. I have two weeks before he will be back." 

 I rented a room and we tore up the bed until I had to leave at five to get back up to LA. I gave her my schedule and told her I would only be able to see her two more times before I had to head to San Diego, She told me that she had some time off coming and she asked me if she could go to San Diego with me. I of course said yes. 

 I drove back to LA, worked the shoot and that evening I raced back to pick Kirby up and take her back up to LA with me. The shoot ran a day over schedule and then we headed for San Diego. Halfway there she started with the "Are we there yet? How much longer?" Every five minutes it was "Are we there yet" and I kept saying no. I knew she was playing some kind of game with me, but I never figured out what it was until she told me to pull over. 

 "Why?" 

 "We aren't there yet and I can't wait. Pull over and let's get up in the sleeper." 

 I smiled and pulled off on an exit ramp, turned on the flashers, set the parking brake and turned to see Kirby already up in the sleeper and taking her clothes off. 

 I had to stop two more times before we got to San Diego. We had a fabulous six days in Diego and I tried to talk her into going to San Francisco with me, but she said that she could only get off the one week that she had just spent with me. I spent one last night with her in a motel in Escondido and then I headed for San Fran and then home. 

 To be continued.  

 

 ****** Apartment 3B Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© For the next two years Kirby and I kept up our off again on again relationship. Sometimes Nick would be home the entire time I was there and Kirby and I wouldn't connect. 

 Somewhere along the way it occurred to me that Kirby and Carol were carbon copies of each other and I began to wonder if Carol was doing it for the same reason Kirby was. I don't mean cheating on me because I was cheating on her because until Kirby I never had. But was she with Monroe because she was just too horny when I was on the road? Was she telling Jason what Kirby was telling me? That she loved her husband, but had to have a sexual outlet when I wasn't there? 

 I decided that I needed to find out just what the deal was with Carol and her lover. The problem was that there wasn't any easy way to do it. I could put a tap on the phone at the house, but it didn't look like Carol ever lived there while I was gone. I could put a recorder under the seat of her Mustang, but it would only be good for maybe eight hours of the several weeks I'd be gone and I didn't want to waste a ton of money on a private detective. I just had to gamble on Carol and her lover talking on the phone while I was home. That didn't seem likely since they had all day to talk to each other at work. 

 I thought about it for a bit and then decided that I would try and set Carol up. I would tell her after she got home from work on Friday that I had to take a car to the state fairgrounds for the weekend and that it wouldn't make any sense for me to drive all the way home just to turn around and go back five hours later. Then I would tell her that I would probably be leaving Monday for a two week shoot in Charlotte. 

 I put a voice activated tape recorder under the seat of her Mustang and rigged one to tape calls on the home phone and then I kissed Carol goodbye and went fishing. I came home Sunday night and Carol damned near killed me in bed. 

 "I've got to stock up for when you are gone." 

 I'd already arranged to take a half a day off work on Monday so Sunday night I got the recorder out from under the seat of the Mustang and Monday I left for work at my regular time. I hit Wal-Mart for a few things and then came home after Carol had gone to work. There was nothing on the car recorder, but there was something on the phone tap. 

 "Hello?" 

 "It's me." 

 "Carol?" 

 "You sound surprised." 

 "I am. You never call when your husband is home." 

 "He isn't home. He is on an all night location at the state fairgrounds." 

 "Does this mean you are coming over?" 

 "Of course not. You know the rules. When Rob is home I'm his and his alone." 

 "But you just said he's not home." 

 "You know full well what I mean. He may no be in the house at this exact moment, but he is home. The reason I'm calling is to let you know he will be leaving Monday for two weeks. I'm calling to remind you to load up on condoms if you expect to spend time with me." 

 "You are really going to do it?" 

 "Yes I am." 

 "You know I don't like using condoms." 

 "Tough shit Jason. If you want to keep seeing me you will start using condoms." 

 "Your plan isn't going to work you know. I've always said he is more interested in his job than you." 

 "What you are saying is that you hope my plan won't work because you know if it does you won't be having me any more." 

 "I'm not worried about that because I know he won't leave his job just because you get yourself pregnant." 

 "Of course he will. He has a wife who loves him and who is crazy about him and he will have a beautiful child that he will have to help raise. He will want to stay home with us." 

 "But..." 

 "No buts Jason. I've already gone off the pill. If you want to continue with me until I give Rob his child you WILL use condoms. And Jason – don't get the cheap ones. You won't like what I'll do to you if one of them breaks. See you at work Monday. Bye." 

 I sat there staring at the recorder as I digested what I'd just heard. She didn't say it outright, but it was easy for me to infer that she was doing just what Kirby was doing – using a fill in when hubby was gone because she needed sex. She pretty much said that Jason was history when I started staying home full time, but the most monumental fact was that she was willing to get herself pregnant to try and keep me home. Before we were married we had talked about kids. I wanted two, a boy and a girl and Carol wanted none. In fact she flat out told me that if having a family was important to me then I should let her go and find some one else. 

 "I love you" she told me, "But I will not under any circumstances be having babies." 

 I loved her and I wanted her and so I had accepted that I would never have a family and I married her. And now here she was deliberately going to let herself get pregnant so she could get me to stay home with her. That one phone call flipped my world on its ear. Jason had a point. I did love my job. I made damned good money at it and before listening to that phone call I would have taken the job over Carol in a heartbeat because of her affair with Jason. Now? I just didn't know. 

 Monday when I came home from work I told Carol that the Charlotte trip had been cancelled and then in a joking manner I said: 

 "I guess you will just have to call your boyfriend back and tell him you won't be free after all." 

 I watched her face as I said it, but she just smiled at me and said in a joking manner: 

 "Damn. He will be so disappointed. I guess I will just have to be satisfied with you" and she drug me off to bed. 

 After Carol fell asleep I laid there staring up at the ceiling and wondered just what I was going to do. 

 ---------------------------------- 

 Over the next two months I passed on two locations – a three day shoot in Miami and a four day shoot in Atlanta – so I could stay home with Carol. I had no idea what transpired at the office between Carol and Jason, but there was never anything on the recorders. Carol came straight home from work every night and I occasionally spot checked on her during her lunch hours and while she did have lunch with Jason a time or two it was straight from work to the restaurant and then straight back to work. I got to where I really believed that as long as I stayed home Carol was mine and mine alone. Our sex life was great. Carol never seemed to get enough and I began to understand why she needed a stand-in while I was gone for weeks at a time. 

 My attitude toward Carol changed a hundred and eighty degrees. She was no longer just a house keeper and sexual outlet for me when I was home. My feelings for her got back to where they were before I found out about Jason. Hey! I am not a hypocrite. She'd had Jason but I'd had Kirby so neither one of us could hold the high ground on the issue. Granted that she had started long before I did, but I had come to understand why. 

 The inevitable happened and a three week location in Palm Springs came up and I had to take it. The long shoots were where the money was and that is why I worked – to make money. When I walked into the lounge I didn't see Kirby. I took a seat at a table and Linda came up and said: 

 "Welcome back." 

 "Is Kirby here?" 

 "She's on break. I'll let her know you are here." 

 She took my drink order and a few minutes later Kirby showed up with my drink and as she set it down in front of me she said: 

 "I wondered if I would ever see you again." 

 "Have I been replaced?" 

 "No. Nick has gone through an uncommonly long stint at home." 

 "Does that mean we are not likely to connect while I'm here?" 

 "I don't know. How long are you going to be here?" 

 "Supposed to be three weeks, but you know how that goes. I could be out of here in two or still be here in five," 

 "Nick hasn't said anything about having to leave so I don't honestly know if I can see you or not." 

 "I'm in room 216 at the motel in case you want to call." 

 "You won't be here nights?" 

 "Why? So I can watch you and know I can't have you? I may stop in from time to time, but no way am I going to come in here and sit for hours knowing that I'll be going back to my room alone." 

 "I'm sorry baby, but you have always known I'm Nick's when he is around." 

 "I know sweetie." She left to get back to work and after I had two drinks I headed back to the motel. Nick never did leave town and at the end of the shoot I headed home. It did not help my mood any to think on the fact that Carol was getting fucked on a regular basis while I was gone and I hadn't even gotten a sniff. 

 ------------------------------- 

 It was two months before I got another trip to California and during that two months Carol did everything she could think of to try and wear me out and keep me worn out. There were times I wondered if she might not have to sneak off to see Jason even though I was home. 

 I kept waiting for Carol to tell me she was pregnant, but it didn't happen and I began to wonder if my little swimmers were up to the task. Then I wondered if it might be Carol. How ironic would that be? She doesn't want a family and then she decides that she does want a little one to tie me down at home, but she can't conceive. 

 Anyway, I got to Palm Springs and when I hit the lounge that night Kirby told me that Nick had been gone a little over a week and she would love to spend some time with me if I would like. Does a duck walk barefoot on the beach? We spent every night for the next nine days together and on the tenth night we were just recovering from a rather strenuous coupling when the phone rang. It was Linda calling to tell Kirby that Nick had just been in the lounge looking for her. Kirby was out of bed, dressed and on her way out the door in less than five minutes and I resigned myself to being alone for the rest of my trip. 

 The next night when I got back to my room there was a message for me to call Linda. 

 "Kirby is in the hospital. Nick found out what she was doing and he hurt her pretty bad. I think he is looking for you." 

 He found me, but I don't think he was too happy that he did. It was about eleven when I heard the knock on the door. I was alone on the shoot so it wouldn't be anyone I worked with and Kirby was in the hospital. I went to the window and pulled the curtain back a hair and looked out. I saw a guy I didn't know, but the tire iron in his hand told me who he was. I went to the door and made a lot of noise with the security chain against the door so he would hear it and then I stepped off to the side and pulled the door open. 

 He heard me with the chain so he thought I would be standing right in front of him when I opened the door. The tire iron swished through empty space and I grabbed his arm and pulled him into the room and then used his forward momentum to pull him across the room and slam his head into the wall. It dazed him, he dropped the tire iron and then I beat the living fuck out of him. 

 "Not so easy when it isn't a woman is it fuck face" I hollered at him as I kicked him in the ribs, head and nuts. I picked up a towel and used it to keep my finger prints off the tire iron and then I picked it up and gave him three hard shots to the right knee. I grabbed him by his collar, pulled him out of my room and hoisted him up on the railing (I was in room 212) and then I pushed him over. If he was lucky the bushes that lined the edge of the parking lot would break his fall. If he missed the bushes? Tough shit! It had been a very hot day and maybe the asphalt would be soft. Then again, maybe not. 

 I went down to the restaurant and used the pay phone to call the front desk and then I disguised my voice and told them that I had just seen a drunk fall off the second floor walkway. I hung up and went across the street to the Oasis and had a few beers. About a half hour after I got there one of the cocktail waitresses asked: 

 "You are staying at the Westward aren't you?" 

 "Yeah." 

 "Any idea what is going on over there?" 

 "Something going on?" 

 "Red lights flashing all over the place." 

 "Haven't got a clue." 

 I left at last call and went back to the motel. Connie was behind the counter and I said that I'd heard that there had been some excitement and she shrugged. 

 "Some drunk thought he was a bird and tried to fly off the second floor balcony. He landed kind of hard in the parking lot. Broke an arm and a leg." 

 I went to my room and went to bed. 

 ----------------------------- 

 The next day was one of those rare days when the sun didn't shine in the Springs. It was overcast and the light wasn't what the film crews wanted so they ended the day early. I was at the hospital at the start of visiting hours and I cringed when I walked into Kirby's room. She looked awful. Face bruised and puffy, black eyes, her right wrist in a splint. I felt guilty. I didn't do the damage, but if I had stayed away from her it wouldn't have happened. 

 She heard me come in and she looked my way and I saw fear wash over her face. She said something but because of her swollen lips I couldn't understand her. I took her left hand in mine and gave it a gentle squeeze and leaned down to put my ear close to her mouth. She jerked her hand out of mine and mumbled: 

 "Get out! You can't be here. You can't let Nick see us together." 

 "You don't have to worry about Nick. He isn't going to be getting around too well for a while." 

 "Oh my God! What did you do?" 

 "He came after me with a tire iron so I put him somewhere in this same hospital." 

 "You hurt Nick? You hurt my Nick? Damn you!" 

 I pulled back from her. "He did this to you – your face, your wrist and the nurse says you have two broken or badly cracked ribs – and you are pissed at me? He came after me with a tire iron and he is damned lucky that I didn't kill the worthless son of a bitch." 

 "You hurt Nick? You bastard!" 

 I stepped back from Kirby's bed stunned at how she was acting. I turned and walked out never looking back. 

 There was no fall out as far as the cops were concerned. Apparently Nick didn't want it to get out that one man had fucked him up so badly. Five days later the shoot was over and I was on my way home. 

 --------------------------- 

 I did my usual and came home earlier than Carol expected and found that things were still the same. I decided to be mean just to see what would happen. I was home watching TV when Carol came rushing in. I knew she had already seen my truck so she knew I was there. 

 "When did you get in?" 

 "Yesterday late. Where have you been?' 

 "Maggie just broke up with her boyfriend and was down in the dumps so I spent the night with her." 

 Maggie was her sister and Maggie and I could not stand each other so it was a safe lie for Carol since she knew I would never call Maggie to check it out. Carol had to be thinking about whether or not I had noticed the lack of a 'lived in' look in the place, but all she did was the only thing she could do under the circumstances. 

 "You should have called and let me know you were coming. We lost a night and now we have to work hard at making up for it." 

 She was stripping off her clothes as I said, "If I called you it would have taken you away from Maggie in her hour of need." 

 "Yeah, right! Like I would choose Maggie over you." 

 After she had exhausted me and fallen asleep I laid there awake and wondered what I should do about our situation if anything. Let it go on? Confront Carol and see where it went? I fell asleep still thinking about it. When I woke up in the morning I did what I had been doing for the last two years. Nothing. 

 --------------------------------- 

 I did do one thing. Curiosity had gotten to me and so I made a doctor's appointment and two days later had the information. If Carol never got pregnant it wouldn't be my fault. My little guys were healthy as hell. 

 I'd been back about five days when Vern came up to me. "I got a call from Linda last night and she gave me a message for you." 

 "What?" 

 "Kirby wants to talk to you. Linda says you should come over to my place and we can set it up so you can do it from there." 

 "Why would I want to talk to Kirby?" 

 "I don't know bud; I'm just the go between here." 

 "Tell Linda to tell Kirby that I am not interested in talking to her. Tell her that the last words she said to me came through loud and clear." 

 Vern never mentioned the outcome after he passed my words back to Kirby via Linda. 

 Given the perverse nature of The Fates it was only three weeks before I was sent back to California. As luck would have it Vern was my co-driver on the trip so Linda knew we were coming and if Linda knew no doubt Kirby did too. We got to Palm Springs and got checked in and then Vern told me he would meet me in the restaurant for dinner in a half hour. 

 When I walked in I saw him in a booth in the back and surprise, surprise Linda and Kirby were sitting with him. I was tempted to turn around and leave, but then I decided that since we would be there two weeks I'd be ducking Kirby for the entire time so best to just get it over with. 

 I went to the booth, sat down and said hello to Linda and Kirby and then I let Linda and Vern monopolize the conversation. I couldn't ignore Kirby since she was sitting right across from me, but other than 'hello' when I got there I didn't speak to her. We ate and then Linda and Vern stood up and Linda said: 

 "Vern and I will get out of here and let you two catch up." 

 I resolved to do something really nasty to Vern for his part in things. Kirby reached for my hand and I pulled it back. 

 "Why won't you talk to me?" 

 "Why would I want to after the last time I saw you? You were quite vocal in what you thought of me for hurting your precious Nick." 

 "I didn't mean it. I was drugged up and not thinking clearly." 

 "Bullshit Kirby. There was nothing drugged about the hatred in your eyes when you called me a bastard for putting the hurt on that worthless mother fucker you were married to. You did get rid of that worthless asshole didn't you?" 

 She looked away from me and that gave me the answer to my question. "Un-fucking real. He puts you in the hospital for doing with me what he was doing with dozens and you are still with him?" 

 "I have to stay with him. You messed him up pretty bad. He can't get around on his own. His leg is in a cast and his knee will never work right again. With a broken wrist and a broken arm he can't even feed himself." 

 "So let one of his sluts take care of him." 

 "I can't Rob. I know you don't understand it, but I love him." 

 "You are right about that Kirby; I don't understand it, but I can tell you the outcome. Once you have helped get back on his feet he is going to take it out on you for his getting fucked up in the first place. To him it will have been all your fault and as far as he is concerned you are going to have to pay." 

 "He isn't like that Rob." 

 "Yes he is Kirby. Any man who would do to a woman what he did to you will do it again. And you will just stand around and wait for him to do it." 

 "Please Rob; can't we just put this behind us? I need you." 

 "No thanks Kirby. I'm sorry, but I can't help you." 

 I got up and left her sitting there in the booth. 

 Four days into the shoot Vern asked me to meet with Linda at the restaurant. I gave him a look that should have had him shaking in his boots and he said: 

 "Just Linda Rob. I won't even be there." 

 I checked closely to make sure that Linda was indeed alone before I joined her. "What's up" I asked as I slid into the booth opposite her. 

 "You know full well Rob. Kirby needs someone to lean on right now and she wants it to be you." 

 "I'm sorry Linda, but it can't be me." 

 "Why not Rob? Why are you being such a hard ass toward her?" 

 "Her asshole husband is going to fuck her up again as soon as he doesn't have to pretend being grateful for her help anymore and it will be because of what I did to him. He will see it as all her fault and he will take it out on her. I'm not going to give him even more ammunition to use against her."  

 

 ****** Apartment 3B Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "I don't understand that." 

 "Someone had to tell him about Kirby and me and then he went after her and came after me. If I give Kirby a shoulder to lean on that same someone will tell him that Kirby and I are back to seeing each other and Nick has already shown what he is capable of. If she gets rid of the asshole I'm here for her, but as long as she is with him I'm not even going to talk to her." 

 "She doesn't think he will hurt her again." 

 "I'll bet she never thought he would hurt her in the first place, but he has already proved her wrong on that score. Guys who beat up on woman don't stop just because the woman says "please don't, I love you." Guys who beat on women are low life scum and they don't change. No thanks Linda, but I will not have anything to do with her as long as she stays with him." 

 I didn't hear from or about Kirby again by the time the location was over and Vern and I loaded up the truck and headed home. I didn't get to spend much time thinking about the situations with Carol and Kirby on the way home because Vern wanted to talk. He and Linda were talking marriage, but she didn't want to leave California and Vern, while he liked California, didn't want to give up his job and move there so it was three days of "What should I do?" He was definitely asking the wrong guy for advice. 

 Shit! 

 I couldn't even figure out what I was going to do with my life. A woman in the west that I was hung up on wanted me as her sex toy, but wouldn't give up her dirt bag husband and a woman in the east who said she loved me to death but was cheating on me by actually living with her lover when I was gone. Yeah Vern, ask ME for advice. 

 ----------------------------------- 

 My home coming was not typical. Carol was at home even though she didn't expect me for another two days. She looked surprised when I walked in the house and saw her sitting on the couch reading a book. She jumped up and ran to me, threw her arms around me and kissed me and then asked why I hadn't called to let her know I was coming. I don't know why I chose that moment or what it was that pushed the "time to get it out" button, but I just looked at her and said: 

 "I didn't call because I expected that you would still be at apartment 3B at least until tomorrow." 

 She stepped back, looked at me and as calmly as you please said, "He's been out of town for almost a week." She paused for a second and then said, "What now?" 

 "I don't know." 

 "Well I do know this much. It is obvious that you have known for a while, but you still let me fuck your brains out so since that is your usual welcome home lets get to it." 

 Her matter of fact attitude so floored me that I didn't even think about how unreal it was as she led me into the bedroom. It was my usual welcome home. Sucked, fucked, sucked and then fucked again. Shower together, she washes my cock, bends over and sucks it hard again and then turns around and leans on the wall while I take her from behind. We got into bed and she snuggled up to me and said: 

 "Want to talk about it now or wait until the morning?" 

 "Morning. I'm too tired right now." 

 Getting it out into the open must have relieved something inside me because for the first time in a long time I slept like a baby. I woke up to the smell of bacon and when I walked into the kitchen Carol said: 

 "Coffees hot and breakfast is almost ready." 

 She acted like it was just another normal day in the Rob and Carol show. I poured myself a cup and sat down at the table and Carol put a plate down in front of me. Eggs, bacon, fried potatoes and sourdough toast. She fixed herself a plate and sat sown and we ate in silence. She got up once to refill our coffee cups and when we finished eating she picked up the plates and put them in the sink. She turned around, leaned against the counter and said: 

 "Okay, let's have it. How long have you known?" 

 "A couple of years." 

 "A couple of years and you've done nothing?" 

 "Why bother?" 

 I explained my thinking as far as having a live in housekeeper and a steady piece of ass when I was home and I saw her face get a sad look." 

 "Why the glum face?" 

 "I was hoping that you would say that you loved me too much to kick me out." 

 "I probably love you as much as you love me." 

 "Sarcasm doesn't become you Robert. You have no idea how much I love you." 

 "I think I have a pretty fair idea. Have you seen a doctor lately?" 

 "A doctor? Why in the hell would I see a doctor and just what do doctors have to do with what we are talking about?" 

 I got up and went to get my briefcase and then brought it back to the kitchen. I took out the mini-cassette recorder and pulled a cassette tape out of an envelope, put it in the player and hit 'play.' 

 "He has a wife who loves him and is crazy about him and he will have a beautiful child that he will have to help raise." 

 Carol's face was pale and she came over and collapsed in the chair. "You know about that?" 

 "I had myself tested and I'm as potent as hell and you are not pregnant. Have you seen a doctor to get checked out?" 

 "Oh my God. You know. I can't believe that you know." 

 "You love me enough to have a kid you don't really want just to have a way to keep me home with you. So I guess I'm not being too sarcastic when I say that I probably love you as much as you love me. What I am having is a hard time trying to reconcile this love you supposedly have for me with your having a permanent full time lover on the side." 

 "I know that this is going to sound trite, but he is not a lover. All he is is a bed buddy. My relationship with him is purely sexual. There is no love involved." 

 "You are splitting hairs here Carol. Love, like or just sex you are still fucking another man and cheating on me. How can you say you love me and do that?" 

 "I don't know Rob. How do you do you justify cheating on me?" 

 "Me cheating on you?" 

 "Oh come on Rob; don't waste time denying it. You have to be getting laid while you are gone. You love sex too much not to be getting it. Deny it if you want to, but I'll never believe you. Every company Christmas party or company picnic we I go to I hear all about those California bimbos that come after you guys. That's pretty near all that Sam, Rick, Jerry, Vern, Billy Bob, Charlie and Mel talk about. You are better looking than any of those guys so I know you have to be getting your fair share. Have I bitched? No I haven't because when you are home you never stray from me. You need sex when you are gone and I need sex when you are gone and as long as we only have each other when you are home it is a win win situation." 

 "So you took up with Monroe because you figured that I was planking some California beach bunny?" 

 "Yep." 

 "That makes it even worse then. That changes how I have to look at things." 

 "Change the way you look at things? Why?" 

 "Up until now I thought that we might have something that we could work our way around, but that isn't the case any more. Now I find out that you have so low an opinion of me and my morals that you can just automatically decide I'm a cheating asshole and then go on your merry way. For your information Carol I never once cheated on you before finding out about you and that asshole you are living with when I'm gone. And even after finding out about you and the asshole I still went almost a year before finding someone that I liked enough to finally say fuck it and enjoy myself since I no longer had a marriage. 

 "You say that listening to the crew made you think was a cheater? Did you ever stop to consider that every one of the guys you just named is single and free to fuck any woman in California they can get to spread her legs? Not married with vows to keep Carol, but single and free to do what they please. I opened up this dialog thinking that we might be able to work around the cheating, but finding out how low an opinion you have of me makes me want to rethink things." 

 I got up and headed for the bedroom. 

 "Where are you going Rob? We need to talk this out." 

 "I have a job to go to Carol and I'm not at all sure now that we have anything to talk about." 

 "I've already called you in sick. Sit your ass down Rob. This has to be settled one way or the other and it needs to be done now. In the first place I do not have a low opinion of you. I have a very high opinion of you. You are a man Rob; you are all man. Sex, as far as I am concerned anyway, is a physical need just like the need to eat, drink and breathe and no healthy man is going to go with out sexual satisfaction for any length of time and the same thing goes for a healthy woman. It is not natural to want sex and deny yourself for long periods of time. A couple of week's maybe. Maybe even a month, but three, four and even five months? No way. If you weren't getting any pussy when I thought you were then you wasted a whole hell of a lot of time. If you weren't getting laid you should have been. 

 "You said a minute ago that you finally broke down and went after someone because you didn't have a marriage any more. You do have a marriage Rob and it is a strong one. I love you and I do my absolute best to show you that I do. You heard it on the tape. I want you here at home with me all the time because I love you and want you where I can touch you all the time. Yes, I cheated, but I did it for the same reason I thought you were doing it. Sex is a physical need and I needed it." 

 "Regardless of that tape Carol I'm having some doubts. For one thing the nature of your relationship with Monroe. Occasional sex is one thing, but it looks like you move in with him as soon as I'm out the door and live with him until I get back. To me that is a hell of a lot more than taking care of the occasional bout of horniness." 

 She was silent for a second or two and then said, "Guilty as charged. What you need to understand is that I don't have occasional bouts of horniness; I'm horny all the time. I've heard that there is no such thing as nymphomania, but I think there is and I am probably a nymphomaniac or at least the closest thing to it you can be without being there. I want sex all the time. I found out by accident that Jason is my male counterpart. I think the term for him is 'satyr'. He always wants it and so do I so we are together when you are gone. Every night and twice a night is the norm. The important thing for you to remember is that when you are home you are the center of my universe. Jason does not exist when you are with me." 

 "And that is supposed to reassure me? I don't do every night and twice a night. Granted that I am up for three and sometimes four times a week and occasionally twice a night, but you are telling me that I can't compete with him or with anyone else for that matter." 

 "No Rob, I'm telling you that you don't have to compete with him. You are all I want. You are all I need. When you are with me I am complete." 

 "But as soon as I'm out the door you are spreading for Monroe and I'm not talking a couple of days later either. You are with him before my tail lights pass the city limit sign." 

 "Again Rob, guilty as charged." 

 "So there has to be more there than just a bed buddy to take care of the hornys." 

 She looked down and didn't say a word. 

 "Come on Carol. This is not the time to hold back. Where we go from here depends on completely honest full disclosure." 

 "Please Rob; you know all that matters." 

 "Maybe Carol, but it is obvious that I don't know everything. I don't want to know everything that you think matters; I want to know everything period." 

 "Please Rob, trust me on this. Anything else I say won't help, only hurt." 

 "All Carol. Every bit of it and right now." 

 She sighed and then said, "Please Rob; please don't take this the wrong way. It isn't a slam against you, honest to God it isn't. Jason has a big cock. A really big cock." 

 "A lot bigger than mine I take it." 

 "It doesn't matter Rob. I swear to you that it does not matter." 

 "Of course it does Carol. Because of his big dick you are on your way to him before my 'goodbye' stops ringing in your ears and you live with him until I'm due home and with me knowing that how in the hell can you tell me that it doesn't matter?" 

 "Because it doesn't matter where you and I are concerned." 

 "How the fuck do you expect me to believe that?" 

 "I'm here Rob; I am always here when you come home. If cock size was all that mattered I could have left you for Jason, but I haven't have I. Do I like Jason's big cock? Yes I do. I love it and as soon as you are gone I am on my way to Jason's to get more of it, but I have two choices Rob. Like Jason and love his cock or love you and the 'love you' always wins and it will always win. Until last night I had the best of all worlds; Jason's cock when you were gone and you when you came home. You heard it on your tape Rob. I flat out told Jason he was history when I got you to stay home with me. I made my choice a long time ago Rob and my choice was you. Not Jason's big cock, but you." 

 I just sat there and looked at her and after a bit she asked, "What are you going to do?" 

 "That isn't the real question here Carol; the real question is what are you going to do?" 

 "Me? What am I going to do? Pray to God I don't lose you." 

 "Are you going to feel that way when you find out that your big plan isn't going to work?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Getting pregnant and having a baby won't make me give up my job. The only things I know are turning wrenches and driving a truck. My job pays me twice what I would make as a mechanic in a dealership so I'm not giving it up. Steve is going to retire in two years and they are already sounding me out about taking his job when he leaves. His job would pay me a little more than I'm making now and there is almost no travel involved so no way am I going to quit now. So the question is, "What are you going to do?" 

 "What? You expect that I'm going to say to hell with you and go to Jason because you won't quit your job? I already told you where I stand. Job or no job I'm with you." 

 "That's not what I meant. Now that you know a baby isn't going to make a difference what are you going to do?" 

 "If I can I'm going to have your child. You want kids and even though I was always against the idea I love you enough to give you what you want. And I know you still want a family. I remember how long ago it was that I said what is on that tape and you have been waiting that long for it to happen and that tells me two things. It says that you aren't going to throw me out and that you want me to give you babies. Am I right?" 

 "I don't know any more Carol. I'm still pretty bummed about you taking up with that Monroe asshole. I know you are staying with him because of his big cock, but how did you find out about his cock in the first place?" 

 "I don't suppose this is s good place to say "just lucky I guess." The expression on my face gave her the answer to that one. She shrugged and said: 

 "A bunch of us stopped after work one night to have a few drinks and unwind from a bad day at the office. The place we stopped at had a live bad and so we did some dancing. I was dancing with Jason and I accidently pushed my leg against him and felt his erection. It felt huge. You had been gone over three months and I was horny as hell. So horny that I was seriously contemplating hitting a bar after work some night and finding me a one night stand. Anyway, after a couple of more drinks and a couple of more dances with Jason I blurted out, "Is it real?" and he smiled at me and told me that the only way I would ever know would be to unzip him, reach in and take it out. Three more drinks and two more dances and I told him I wanted to see it. He walked me out to the parking lot and then said: 

 "If you want to see it you have to be the one to take it out." 

 "So I did. I unzipped him, reached into his undershorts and worked it out. I wasn't a virgin when we married and you knew it. I'd seen maybe a half dozen cocks, but I had never seen one like Jason's. It was ten inches long and thick and my first thought when I saw it was "I wonder if I can take that thing." And of course I tried and I did and here we are." 

 "And you are so hung up on it that very second that you are not with me you are with him." 

 "You are making it sound like I'm a slave to his big cock and that is not the way it is. After the first time with him I realized that I was not going to go without sex any more while you were gone, but I didn't want to go the bar scene route and end up with God knows what both in the way of men and what they might be carrying with them. I would want a regular boyfriend and not a bunch of boyfriends and I loved what Jason's big cock did for me and so I picked him to be my steady. 

 "Only my idea of 'steady' was once or twice a week, but Jason's idea was every night. I did it with him a couple of times a week for three weeks and then all of a sudden he didn't have time for me. He had found him a girl who was in tune with his every night idea. You came home a week later and for two months everything was fine and then you went off on another two month trip. After three weeks I was so horny that I was seriously thinking of picking up a one night stand. I decided to do it and one day I took a change of clothes to work with me and at quitting time I changed into a short skirt, low cut blouse and heels and when I came out of the ladies room Jason saw me and asked me where I was going looking so hot and sexy. I told him I was going out to look for a playmate and he said: 

 "Look no farther." 

 "He had broken up with the girl he was seeing and so I followed him home and ever since then I'm there all the time to try and keep him from finding another full-time playmate. It is still a risk because he could find someone more permanent when I'm not there while you are home. So far it has only happened once and she only lasted for three weeks." 

 "It sounds like that if I were out of the picture totally you would move in with him on a permanent basis." 

 "Not a chance. To live with someone permanently you have to love them and I don't love Jason. I love his cock and what he can do with it, but that is as far as it goes. He doesn't love me either. All I am to him is a steady piece of ass. We like each other, but there is no love, just sex. So I can't answer your question. It isn't up to me. It is up to you. Your wife is a cheating, big cock loving slut who loves you and doesn't want to be without you. You have to be the one making the decisions here." 

 "I've already made it. I'm not giving up my job and that means I'm still going to be gone a lot." 

 "You need to tell me what is going on here Rob. As I see it you have two choices. You can toss my cheating ass out. You can tell me that what is in the past is in the past but to stay home from now on. What are you going to do?" 

 "You forgot a third choice. Tell you to make damned sure that you are here when I get home." 

 "You are serious?" 

 "As serious as death. But you need to understand that if you play so will I and that can be dangerous. If I go with choice number three I suppose you will be on your way to Jason's as soon as I'm gone?" 

 "If you are serious about it I'll be on my way before the sound of the door closing behind you fades away." 

 "Wrong answer Carol. Somehow, despite all you have said and despite what I heard on the tape I'm having a huge amount of trouble believing it if you can be so quick to get to your lover." 

 "Do not doubt me on this Rob, you are my only lover. The only thing important to me is that I don't lose you. If you tell me that you aren't kicking me out and the price of keeping you is to sit here and suffer while you are gone I will – underscore the will – sit here and suffer. If you want me to quit my job so that I'm no longer around Jason I'll pick up the phone and do it right now. Whatever I have to do to keep you I will do. No qualifiers Rob. Whatever I have to do. But no lies either. You give me the freedom to see Jason and I will see Jason. You tell me that a boyfriend is okay as long as it isn't Jason then Jason is history. I can not be clear enough on this Rob; the only important thing to me is that I do not lose you. I'm astounded that you have known as long as you have and that we are still together. That gives me hope. What you have said to me so far gives me hope, but with everything that has been said and brought out into the open it is clear to me that we need to get it all out right now. We need to move away from today with both of us absolutely clear on things."  

 

 ****** Apartment 3B Ch. 02 ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© She looked at me in silence for several long moments and then said, "You said that if I played you would and a minute ago you said that if you played it could be dangerous. What did you mean by that?" 

 "I meant what I said when I told you that I had never been unfaithful until I found out that you were. Once I decided that you didn't love me any more and that our marriage was over I started looking and I met a lady that I thought was kind of special. I was seeing her on almost every trip I took to California." 

 "You used the past tense. Does that mean you don't see her any more?" 

 "That isn't the point. For all practical purposes you lost me to her. That is what I meant when I said it could be dangerous. I got more than sexually involved with her, I also got emotionally involved and that is the problem that I am sitting here facing. I've listened to the tape and half of me is saying "She loves me" but thee other half is thinking about my emotional involvement with Kirby and believing that you can't possibly be practically living with Monroe full time as soon as I'm out the door and not be emotionally involved. It is not the sexual involvement with Monroe that bothers me; it is the emotional aspect. 

 "You need to understand this clearly Carol. I loved you without reservation right up until I found out about you and Monroe. I wrote you and our marriage off at that point. You were history. The only reason I did nothing was because I figured it would be cheaper than a divorce to keep you to take care of the house when I was gone and a convenient piece of ass when I was home. All you were to me at that time was a cheating piece of trash. I hooked up with Kirby and if things had been different I would have taken the divorce route and Kirby and I would be together right now. The point being that even though I loved you I wrote you off believing that you didn't love me any more. I mean how could you if you were living with another man. 

 "The way I got emotionally involved with Kirby shows me just how dangerous it can be. You can deny it until you are blue in the face, but in my mind you can not have the live in relationship that you have with Monroe and not be emotionally involved. I was flirting with the idea of going with what I said was the third choice, but your statement about just how quick you would be to be on your way to Monroe killed that idea. It screams at me that there is emotional involvement even if you won't admit it. My choice is going to be what you called the second of the two choices that you thought I had. I will let bygones be bygones and I will keep my cock in my pants when I am on the road and you will keep your panties on and pulled up tight until I get home. If you can live with that we can go forward from here." 

 "Should I quit my job?" 

 "Why would you do that?" 

 "To put distance between Jason and me." 

 "I'm not going to worry about that. Just you remember that I knew about what you were doing with Jason long before I got that tape. If you backslide I will know it and I am not into giving second chances. You have already used your "get out of jail free" card. Are we clear on that?" 

 "Absolutely clear. Can we go back up to bed now and celebrate my not getting tossed out on my ass?" 

 "Lead the way sweetie." 

 The next two months went by and then I was off to Palm Springs again. 

 ----------------------------- 

 She twirled the rose between her fingers as she looked across that table at me. 

 

 "I've missed you." 

 "That comes as a surprise to me given some of the things you said to me when I saw you in the hospital." 

 "I explained that to you the last time we talked. You didn't allow for the fact that I was hurting and heavily medicated. I wasn't thinking all that clearly." 

 "Connie tells me that you have gotten rid of Nick." 

 She looked down at the table and said, "Kind of." 

 "Kind of? What do you mean by "kind of?" 

 "Please try and understand Rob. I love Nick. I always have and I probably always will." 

 "That doesn't tell me how you "kind of" got rid of him." 

 "You were right about him Rob. He did just what you said he would do. He had me wait on him hand and foot until he was back on his feet and then he beat the hell out of me for being the cause of all that happened to him. I love him, but I'm not stupid and I called 911 and when the cops and paramedics showed up they took me to the hospital and Nick to jail. I pressed charges and based on what he did to me that time and the time before he got eleven months in county. I visit him every Sunday and I told him I would wait for him as long as he understood that if he ever lifted a finger against me again I'd put him right back in jail. He really doesn't like it there so when he promised that it would never happen again I believed him. So yes, I kind of got rid of him for about seven more months. After that we will see." 

 "Seven months huh? You told him you would wait, but did you tell him you would stay true?" 

 "No, but I had planned on doing it until I got my roses. You do have a room here right?" 

 "Yes I do." 

 "Would you like some company for as long as you are here?" 

 "Oh yeah, I most definitely would." 

 I got up and told her I needed to go to the bathroom and I went out and told the desk clerk to bill the call to my room and then I picked up the house phone and made a call. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hello sweetie." 

 "Hi baby. Why are you calling so late? Checking up on me?" 

 "How would I do that? You could have someone between your legs right now and I have no way of knowing." 

 "I promised baby." 

 "I know you did and that's why I'm calling. Why don't you give Jason a call." 

 "Oh my. Talk about the unexpected. I take it that it means that my baby is going to be bad tonight?" 

 "Yes it does." 

 "You can't have been out there for more than six hours and for you to connect that quick it has to be someone you know. Is it the one you told me about? What was her name – Kirby?" 

 "That's the one." 

 "Do I have to worry?" 

 "No more than I had to about Jason." 

 "Ouch! I guess I deserved that. Does it have to be Jason?" 

 "Why do you ask that?" 

 "The next door neighbor's son is home for the summer. I hired him to cut the grass while you are gone. He looks at me like he wants to eat me up." 

 "Jimmy? He's only seventeen." 

 "Eighteen last week." 

 "Why the sudden interest in the young stuff?" 

 "He can't be very experienced so I should be able to teach him how I want it done." 

 "I'm stunned. I thought for sure as soon as I told you to call Jason you would drop the phone and I'd hear the front door open and then close." 

 "Jason does have that marvelous cock and I do love the way he uses it, but he can be a little rough sometimes. I need gentle right now and not rough and I believe I can teach Jimmy how to be gentle but effective." 

 "You don't care for rough huh?" 

 "I like it from time to time. Shit! That's a lie. I love it when Jason takes me hard." 

 "Then why Jimmy instead of Jason?" 

 "Well sweetie, it is this way. As an about to be new mommy I don't want to subject your baby to rough." 

 "Rob?" 

 "Hello?" 

 "Rob? Are you still there Rob? Talk to me baby." Report_Story
