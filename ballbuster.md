 Dear Readers, Lady Sara and Gail edited and assisted on this story. Thank you, ladies. This is the romantic story of a man and a woman with Dominance/ submission overtones. I hope you enjoy it. E.Z. 

 

 BALLBUSTER 

 Some would say Ellen is not beautiful. Some would say she is not even pretty because her features are sharp. Some consider her ass a little broad. But, when she wants to, she has a gleam in her eye which attracts men without repelling women. She is personable and intelligent, easily managing an excellent career and many friendships. She has a passion for life and enjoys everything from cooking to golfing. When she wants to be, she is a world-class lovemaking machine in bed. 

 To me, she is perfect. However, there was a problem. 

 Like many women, she did not respect men she could belittle or dominate. With her talents, intelligence and money, she did not respect most men she dated. She had fallen into the habit of browbeating every man who sought a serious relationship with her, and not enduring men she could successfully cower. 

 Over the ten years since she came back to the city after college, she had been called many things. About the nicest nickname she had was ballbuster. 

 "Jack, I am having a dinner party Friday. I wondered if you are free?" she said when I answered the phone that night. 

 Often, Ellen had tried to set me up with this widow or that divorcee, but I was still single at thirty-four in spite of her efforts and those of countless women like her. 

 "Who's the lucky woman this time, Ellen?" 

 Did I hear a hesitation, a catch, in her voice? 

 "Me." 

 I had heard a rumor she had driven off the guy who had been living with her, locking him out of the house she bought with an inheritance from her uncle. I was wondering if she would ever call me. Wondering and hoping. 

 "Shit, no! You are too fucking mean for me." 

 "Oh, Jack. Cursing is not gentlemanly. Do you curse just because you know it upsets me?" 

 "You bet your fucking ass, I do. I don't want you to set your sights on me, ballbuster." 

 She sighed as if she were the martyr bearing her cross and ignored my comment. 

 "Well, are you free?" 

 "No. I'm doing my hair." 

 "I expect you to be here at seven. Dress is casual. And, bring me flowers." 

 I did not reply. She waited ten seconds and disconnected. Rude? Yes. Typical? Yes. Twice I received messages from her on my voice mail confirming Friday night. Each time, I left her a voice mail message saying, "Not only no, hell no!" Friday at five my phone rang. 

 "Jack, are you coming?" 

 "No, ballbuster. I made that clear." 

 "Please." Her voice was soft and pleading. 

 "Don't try that 'I'm a sweet little woman' shit on me, you shark!" 

 "Jack, my table will be unbalanced. It will be socially embarrassing for me if you do not come." 

 "Make me an offer I can't refuse!" 

 She laughed sharply. I could see the smirk on her face through the telephone. 

 "Okay. Bring your toothbrush!" 

 "Not good enough." 

 "I beg your pardon!" 

 Her voice was colder than a January ice storm. 

 "Not you. I know you're the best piece of pussy in the whole damn state when you want to be. The offer of one night in your bed is not good enough." 

 "What do you want?" 

 "I want you for as long as I want you." 

 She emitted a flurry of little gasps. I heard a sob, then, silence for what seemed an eternity. 

 "What are you saying, Jack?" she whispered. 

 "I want you for at least two weeks. And, I want you as my sex slave." 

 "Sex slave? Sex slave! Oh! You. You. You are hopelessly infantile!" 

 "Not infantile. Adolescent, perhaps. Perverted, maybe. Your vocabulary is slipping, ballbuster." 

 "I should hang up on you! You are such an oversexed buffoon!" 

 "Look, ballbuster. I'm the only man left in the city who has the confidence to take you on. It's you, not me, who has an unbalanced table. You should be nicer to me." 

 She was silent. 

 "Anyway, when was the last time you were royally fucked. If you weren't such a stuck-up bitch, you'd admit you want me between your legs, my cock slamming your sweet pussy until you scream. You liked me there very much, as I remember." 

 The silence was deafening. With each passing second, I was more sure she was going to take my offer. 

 "Jack?" 

 "Yes, Ellen?" 

 "What would I have to do?" she said in a soft, little girl voice. 

 "Whatever I tell you, whenever I tell you. Total, wild, wonderful sex. That part will be easy, Ellen. For you, the hard part will be sweetness and surrender." 

 "Perhaps not, Jack. I have missed you," she said, her voice teasing and sexy. 

 "I'm not worried about the first night, ballbuster. Or, the second. I'm thinking of all the days and nights after that. If you fight me, I won't be gentle with you. I'll spank your ass each time you try your ballbusting tactics on me." 

 "Jack, no man has ever spanked me," she replied coquettishly, obviously enjoying the repartee. 

 "Then, it is time, unless you can behave yourself." 

 "Is spanking the way you treat a woman these days, Jack? I thought you were more gentlemanly than that." 

 "I am a gentleman, unless the woman is a ballbuster. I will treat you as you behave, Ellen." 

 "How should I behave?" she replied impishly. 

 "In public, as you always have. In private, as the slutty sex slave you really want to be." 

 I heard her gasp. 

 "I am not a slut! God, what an absurd, arrogant, chauvinistic pig you are! You are not even a pig. You are a piglet! You are not mature enough to be a pig!" 

 "Now, now, ballbuster. Unbalanced table and social embarrassment, or, wild, wanton sex. It's an easy choice, even for you." 

 "Go to hell!" 

 She disconnected. 

 I told my secretary to order five dozen red roses, one dozen each from five different florists, and, have them all delivered by seven. In ten minutes, the phone rang. 

 "All right. Have it your way. I have no choice!" 

 "Of course, you have a choice. You can tell your guests I was your date and I got sick." 

 "No, Jack. I want you here. I'll do it." 

 "Good decision, ballbuster. Write a quick legal agreement saying you'll be my sex slave for fourteen days. Give it to me when I walk in tonight, or, I'll turn around and walk out. Use the words 'unconditional sex slave'. I want it in your own handwriting on your embossed stationery." 

 "No." 

 "Then, we have nothing to talk about. Have a nice evening, Ellen." 

 "Wait! Don't hang up. Why are you doing this?" 

 "You know. Do we have an agreement?" 

 "Let's talk about it when you arrive." 

 "I'll be there, but there'll be nothing to talk about. I will walk out if you don't have the agreement in writing." 

 "You are insufferable!" 

 "You're delightful and sexy as hell, even if you are the biggest bitch in the state." 

 She sighed as if burdened beyond the ability to bear it. 

 "You need to clean up your language with my guests." 

 I didn't respond. She waited a reasonable time before continuing. That she waited at all was a small miracle. 

 "I'll see you at seven, Jack. Thank you for coming." 

 Her voice was soft this time. 

 "It'll be my pleasure, Ellen," I replied honestly. 

 When I arrived, Ellen was perfectly dressed in a classy way. She does have excellent taste. She had a naughty twinkle in her eyes as she kissed me on the cheek. 

 "The flowers are beautiful, Jack. Thank you." 

 The doorbell rang with yet another floral delivery. I carried the flowers into the kitchen, holding them as she searched for a vase. After she arranged the roses, she handed me a sealed envelope. I slid it into my pocket. 

 "Not going to read it?" she asked, teasing me. 

 "When we're alone, ballbuster. Anyway, I trust you." 

 "Jack, I hate that nickname." 

 "Then, let's change you so it won't fit." 

 When a woman looks at a man the way Ellen looked at me, one of two things is going to happen. Either she'll fuck him silly, or, she'll slap the hell out of him. Or, sometimes a third thing will happen. The doorbell rang again. 

 The party was outstanding. Another thing Ellen does very well is play hostess. The food was superb, the wine perfect for the meal, and the conversation warm and rich. During the dinner, I watched her. Ellen is really a classy lady. However, there was something about serious interpersonal relationships that made her go off center. When she became serious about a man, or, he became serious about her, she changed. She tried to drive him away, or, to break him. No doubt about it, she would be a handful for the man lucky enough to win her. 

 After all the guests were gone, I pulled my car into her garage so the neighbors would not gossip. The maid finished the dishes while we visited in the living room. Ellen sat on the couch beside me, just an inch out of "personal" range. She was soft and warm that night as we passed pleasantries. I took that as a good sign. 

 "Tell me about Bozo," I said, referring to the guy she evicted three weeks ago. He had flaming red hair, but the reason for the Bozo comment was he didn't have a real or serious bone in his body. 

 "He was not the right man for me," she said, watching me over her wine glass. "I need someone special. Someone who understands and loves me." 

 "Does such an unique man exist?" 

 "Yes. I know he exists." 

 She moved closer. Her hand fell to my knee. Her face was intent, her eyes serious. 

 "You know, Jack, sometimes women make mistakes in relationships. They might tell someone no when they mean yes, or, when they mean take me. Sometimes they want a strong man to sweep them off their feet, but they fight him every second. Maybe, they don't really know what they want until it is too late. That is sad. Hopefully, they get a second chance." 

 Ellen stopped when the maid entered. She escorted her to the door and locked up. I sat on the couch thinking of the time we had been together. We dated for almost eighteen months, ending two years and, for her, three lovers ago. During those two years, we moved in the same social circles. I saw her at parties and other events where we often visited as two old friends. My interest had grown, rather than diminished. 

 She knew how I felt about her. She knew all she had to do was tell me she was willing to be mine and I would marry her in a moment. She also knew someone in the relationship had to be more dominant, and I wanted that someone to be me. It was my fault we broke up. I was afraid to be as tough as she needed and wanted, even if she was not consciously aware she wanted it. My weakness meant her bitchiness continued. When I could not stand it any longer, I left. 

 

 She was a ballbuster. That night as I sat on her couch waiting for her to return, I thought she was trying to tell me she was ready to change. I hoped to hell that change included me. 

 I stood when she reentered the room, taking her hand. I replenished our wine and led her to her bedroom. 

 Ellen sat demurely at her dressing table, her eyes following me as I began undressing. She said nothing as I stripped, but a smile fluttered across her face when she saw my cock. She had seen it before and enjoyed it often when we were lovers. 

 "Why are you still dressed?" 

 She gave me a sly grin. 

 "I've never been a sex slave. Isn't that what I agreed to be for two weeks? I don't know what to do. So, I am waiting for my master to instruct me." 

 I pulled her into my arms. 

 "You sound like you enjoy saying master." 

 "I'm a good actress," she fired back with the devil in her eyes. 

 I kissed her lightly. 

 "Undress for me. Do it sensually, slowly. You know how." 

 As I watched, she did a slow, lovely strip, relishing the obvious effect she had on me. Naked now, she gave me a questioning look, asking for instructions. 

 "Now, come here, little slut!" 

 "Don't call me that!" 

 "Ellen, you're going to be my slut, my private, personal slut! And, not just when it suits you, but, when it suits me! Now, come suck my cock!" 

 "Not until you apologize for calling me a slut!" 

 "Slut, get my cock in your mouth now or I'll spank your big ass until it's cherry red!" 

 "Big ass? Go to hell!" 

 I advanced. She stood her ground. I was prepared for this eventuality. When it was over, we were sweaty and gasping for air, but she was on the floor with her hands cuffed behind her. She fought just hard enough to let me win without being obvious my conquest of her is what she wanted. I wondered if she consciously knew that as she looked at me provocatively. 

 "Do you have any idea how sexy you are, naked and bound at my feet?" 

 "Let me go, Jack," she said unconvincingly. 

 I pulled her up, crushed her to me and kissed her long and hard. My hands roamed her body, squeezing her ass, massaging her breasts. 

 "Looking forward to your two weeks, sweet little slut?" 

 "Don't call me that! No! Owww! You bastard!" 

 That last came in response to a very hard swat of my hand on her ass. She squirmed, trying to rub the swat but unable to reach it. I kissed her again. She resisted at first, but quickly melted into me. I stared into those beautiful and hot eyes of hers. 

 "Ellen, I'll let you out of this game. You can call off our agreement. I'll leave now, or we can make love tonight and I'll leave in the morning. If you pass this up, I will own you for two weeks." 

 She smiled at me with a look of love I hadn't seen from her in a long, long, time. I can't tell you how much I had missed that look. I kissed her very softly. She kissed back completely, pressing her body into me, squirming against me, crushing her breasts against my chest, trying to get my hard cock between her legs. 

 "Ready to be spanked?" 

 "You don't need to spank me. I've surrendered to you. Just take me." 

 "Take you where?" 

 "You know what I mean." 

 "No. I don't. Tell me!" 

 We kissed again. I relished the heat flowing from her. I felt my erection hard between her thighs, saw the lust in her face when I finally broke the kiss. 

 "I'm going to spank you now. I'll enjoy watching the best ass in the state turn a bright red." 

 "Just the state? I thought you liked it better than that." 

 "Don't get cocky, slut!" 

 "I am not a slut!" 

 "You will be. You will be my slut, my submissive, slutty, sex slave, horny all the time for me, happy to do whatever I tell you." 

 She turned a beet red, blushing as a tear slipped down her cheek. 

 "Jack, I have never surrendered to a man before. I. . . " 

 I kissed her softly. The intensity flamed as our mouths crushed in wet heat. My hand found the vortex of her legs. She whimpered and yielded to my caresses. 

 "Please, Jack. I want you," she moaned, as she squirmed against me. 

 "What do you want?" 

 "You know, Jack. Please." 

 "Tell me. Tell me what you want." 

 "Jack, you know I don't say things like that." 

 "You do now. Say 'I'm a horny slut and I want you to fuck me'." 

 "Jack, your hand, ohhhh, please, Jack, don't stop. Your hand is magical." 

 "Say it!" 

 "Nooooo, please . . . pleaseeee . . . so close . . . " 

 "Say it!" 

 "Jack, Jack . . . don't stop! You bastard! Ohhhh . . . yes . . . please! I'll say it! Don't stop! Oh, god, I am a horny slut and I want you to fuck me!" 

 "Again!" 

 "I'm a horny slut, I am a horny slut . . . oh, god, yesss . . . yesss . . . I'm cummmmingggg . . . " 

 "I love it when you cum, your face contorted in ecstacy, your muscles tight and spasming. You are more beautiful than ever. Did you enjoy that?" 

 "Ummmmm." 

 She floated in her afterglow as I kissed her and tantalized her with my hands. As her eyes fluttered open, she gave me a soft, loving smile. 

 "I love you, Jack." 

 I'd waited an awfully long time to hear those words from her, but it wasn't the appropriate time for me to show how happy it made me. I kissed her again and laid her over my lap with her ass exposed and available. She snuggled against me, feeling my hard cock against her belly. I kissed the small of her back, that tiny dimple at the top of her superb ass. Softly, I began kissing her ass, tasting it, feeling the coolness, knowing the next time I kissed her there it would be hot and throbbing. 

 I brought back my hand and swatted, not hard, but medium strength. She jumped a little and gasped, but did not complain and settled back in quickly. I rubbed her ass, feeling the heat. The muscle quivered under my hand. I wanted to do this slowly, rhythmically. 

 "Jack . . . Stop, now . . . ohhhhh . . . please . . . no more . . . I'll do whatever you want . . . Noooo!" 

 "That's only twelve. You're getting fifteen." 

 I kissed her ass again. It twitched from the comparative coolness of my lips. I stroked her pussy, finding her soaked and the labia bloated to capacity. She groaned and pushed back against my fingers, trying to get them into her. I swatted very hard. 

 "Stop, Jack," she screeched. 

 "What are you?" 

 "Sore . . . ohhhhh. Ouch." 

 "Well?" 

 "Yes, stroke me . . . NOOOO!" 

 "Talk or I'll never stop spanking your ass!" 

 "I'm a horny slut and I . . . " 

 "Yes?" 

 "Oh, God, Jack . . . I love it . . . UHHHH!" 

 "What?" 

  

 

 

===

"Fuck me! I'm a horny slut and I need to be fucked!" 

 I slid her to the floor. With her hands bound behind her, her breasts and head rested on the soft carpet. I grabbed her hips and thrust in doggy style. She screamed and begged me to fuck her harder. I have no idea how many times she came before she collapsed on the floor with me on and in her. 

 I pulled out and stood, yanking her to her knees. She was startled, but opened readily and took me in her mouth. I fucked her face until I came. Ellen always did like sucking cock and this was the best she ever had been. I carried her to bed and removed her handcuffs. She curled against me, entwining our bodies. With soft, barely focused eyes, she gazed into my face. 

 "That spanking hurt, Jack," she whispered. 

 "Good. I'll spank you, Ellen, every time you need it. Tell the truth. You were aroused and you loved it." 

 The sly, sexy look told me I was right, but she might never admit it. 

 "Of course not. Promise me you'll never do it again." 

 "I promise you I'll do it every time you need it. And, next time I'll not be as gentle." 

 She didn't reply. She stared at me for a long time as we lay together. Then, she tucked her head under my chin. As she closed her eyes in sleep, she murmured it again. 

 "I love you, Jack." 

 In the morning, she was pressed hard against me. I was sure her wrists were sore from having been bound, her pussy sore from being fucked and her ass sore from being spanked. I drew a hot tub of water and carried her into the bathroom. 

 "Pee first," she mumbled. 

 I sat her on the toilet, then helped her into the tub to soak. After making coffee, I joined her in the big tub, soaking and sipping coffee, gently bathing each other. In the water, we made love slowly and sweetly. 

 When she started to dress, I said, "You forgot something." 

 "What?" 

 "You have not asked me what clothes you may wear today." 

 I expected a bitch fit. What I got was a shy, sexy smile. 

 "What may I wear?" 

 I gave her a dirty look. She knew what I wanted. 

 "What may I wear . . . master?" 

 "Bra and blouse, skirt, shoes." 

 "That's all?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Jack, I . . . " 

 She stopped, smiling at me again. 

 "Yes, master," she answered, sounding like a sweet, submissive woman. 

 No doubt, she'd never left her house without panties before that day. 

 We drove to my favorite restaurant hangout for Mexican eggs, which means you get more jalapenos than eggs and a ton of tortillas to help them go down. She was delightful company. After a long brunch, I drove to the local bondage boutique. 

 "I will not go in there," she snapped. 

 Her body was rigid, her face tight with lips compressed. It wasn't a desire to control me I saw in her, but a fear of what it might mean to her. We sat in the car a few moments. Her eyes flicked back and forth between me and the store front. She licked her lips nervously. 

 "What's the problem, ballbuster?" 

 For an instant, our eyes locked together and I could read her emotions. Ellen was torn between surrender and resistance. Then, she looked away, sighing deeply as she struggled with her own feelings. 

 "Let's go, ballbuster," I said firmly, as I dragged her from the car. 

 She held my hand with a crushing grip as we walked through the shop. She shivered when I stopped to examine their display of whips. She was visibly relieved when all I purchased was a basic bondage set and a collar and leash. By then, fear was waning; arousal and curiosity were waxing. Her eyes were bright, eager and sexy, until I slipped the collar around her neck. 

 "Okay. It fits. Take it off!" 

 I made no move to remove it, nor did she, although it had a simple buckle she could easily reach. She did constantly survey the room to make sure she knew no one there. I saw the excitement in her eyes. 

 "You like it, don't you?" 

 "Of course not. How absurd. Now, take it off!" 

 "That's no way for a sex slave to talk to her master, Ellen," I replied, unable to restrain a smile. 

 Her frightened look morphed into shyness as she leaned into me, her hands on my chest. 

 "Yes, I like it. Please though, this is something I want to do only in private. Take it off, please, master." 

 I removed the collar to her visible relief, kissed her and led her to the car. She was abnormally quiet as we drove toward her house. The equipment lay at her feet in a sack. She reached down and retrieved the collar. She absentmindedly played with it as she watched me intently. 

 "May I ask a question . . . master?" 

 "Yes." 

 "What do you have planned for me?" 

 "I'm going to make you my submissive sex slave. When I know you can be sufficiently trained, we'll move in together." 

 "Will we marry and have children?" 

 That was a question requiring full attention and concentration. I drove the car into a parking lot, parked and turned to her. She looked excited and a little frightened. Ellen excited and submissive is more beautiful than Ellen as a ballbuster. 

 "Would you like that?" I asked. 

 "Yes. I'd like that more than anything in the world." 

 Honest emotion, deeply given. She'd admitted she wanted and needed me. She was so vulnerable now and it frightened her. After ten years of ball busting, saying she wanted a real relationship had to be as hard as anything she had ever done. 

 "I want to marry you, too, Ellen. I want it more than anything in the world. You know that." 

 Her face burst into sunshine. A tear of joy trickled down her cheek. 

 "But - I cannot and will not live with a woman who treated me as you did. So, if you want to marry me and bear my children, learn how to be a submissive sex slave quickly." 

 I stroked her face gently and softened my voice. 

 "I'll help you, Ellen. I know you can do it. I know you want to do it." 

 When I put my hand on the gearshift, her hand covered mine. 

 "Will you ever tell me you love me?" 

 "I did once, Ellen. Our relationship soured very quickly after I did." 

 "I know. I'm very sorry for that. It was the biggest mistake of my life." 

 Dammit! I got tears in my eyes! Masters are suppose to be tougher than that. 

 "Jack, I know why you walked out on me. I admit I was a bitch, a ballbuster. My god, even my mother told me no self-respecting man would put up with me. Please don't walk out this time. Please, Jack, give me time, give me a chance." 

 "I will, Ellen," I replied. 

 We kissed as we sat in the car in the parking lot of a grocery store on a bright and glorious day. I held her as she cried until she lay soft and depleted against my shoulder. She sat quietly as I put the car in gear and pulled out to reenter traffic. We had gone only a block when she spoke again. 

 "Jack?" 

 "Yes, Ellen?" 

 "Do you really plan to bind me with these things?" 

 "Occasionally, for fun. Sometimes, if you need it. Primarily, they're symbolic." 

 "Do you plan to spank me?" Her voice caught on "spank," as if the word hurt coming out. 

 "Yes, every time I think you need it. It will not be symbolic. It will be real." 

 She nodded in acknowledgment. We drove to her house, each lost in our own thoughts which were so separate and, yet, so inseparably plaited. I drove into her garage and killed the engine. 

 She'd been playing with the collar. Our eyes locked again, unable to look away. 

 Tentatively, Ellen fastened the collar around her neck. She was shaking as she handed me the leash. She tilted her head back. As I reached toward her to fasten the leash, her hands seized my wrists. Desperation poured through her fingers as she dug her nails into me. 

 We waited, our hands suspended in time and air, before she spoke. Her voice was tight and filled with a gut wrenching honesty. 

 "I don't want to be a ballbuster. I want to be your wife and the mother of your children. I want to belong to you. But, Jack, am I trainable?" 

 "Yes, you are, if you want to be. Then, you will be a wonderful wife and mother. I can't wait to make you both." 

 I felt the tension leave her hands, the pressure of her nails cease. Her hands dropped into her lap. I clicked the leash on her collar. Gently, I pulled her toward me. We kissed very softly. 

 "Last time was partially my fault," I said. "I wasn't mentally tough enough for you. I am now." 

 Her eyes twinkled, bright with fire and passion and hope for the future. A smile curled her lips. She raked her fingers down my cheek. 

 "I hope so, Jack. After all, they do call me ballbuster." 

 The End. 

 Please! Give me your comments!
