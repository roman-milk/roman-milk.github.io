Becoming A Slut Husband: Rob
============================
#1 

===

It had been a long, hard, but very satisfying evening. It had started out with one hell of a good blow job, followed by my eating a baby smooth bald pussy and then a hot fuck session. We then eased into a sixty-nine until I was hard again and then she mounted me and rode me reverse cowgirl until we both came. A short break to catch our breath was followed some more sixty-nine and then one more hot, hard fuck before it was time for me to go. 

In the afterglow of sexual exhaustion Stella said, "Jesus, a body would think that you never got any at home the way you go after me when we are alone." 

That's because I don't sweetie I thought to myself, I don't even get a sniff of pussy at home. I didn't tell Stella that, just as I would never tell her that it was my choice that I didn't get any at home. Why waste my time on a woman who didn't really want me when I had a host of sexy young secretaries and file clerks I could try and seduce. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I got in on a hot dot com when they were all the rage and one day another of the investors, a guy I trusted to know those things, called me on the phone and told me that it was time to get out. I followed his advice and made a bundle before the crash. Next, he called me and asked me to join him in a real estate deal and five months later we sold the property to a company that wanted to build a high-rise and I tripled my investment. Next Tim took the money and put it into land and nine months later a developer bought the land from us to build a gated community. Tim kept doing things with the money and like Topsy the money just kept growing. 

One day I sat down and took stock of things and saw that I was a millionaire five times over. At that point I pulled out my money and used it to set myself up in business. I started out with five employees in a small warehouse and three years later I owned a five-story office building, had one hundred and ten employees and a net worth of over eleven million dollars. 

Suddenly, the guy who couldn't get laid in a whorehouse if he walked in waving a hundred-dollar bill was very popular with the ladies. I wasn't dumb, I knew what they were after and for a long time I played them while they tried to play me. 

And then I met Audrey. Tall at five nine and perfectly proportioned, she exuded class and I fell ass end over teakettle in love with her. At first I was as wary of her as I had been of all the others. Just because I was in love didn't mean I had to be stupid, but Audrey did not seem to care that I was worth millions. In fact, Audrey didn't seem to care about me at all. It took me almost nine months to land her. 

Six years went by and I thought we had a pretty good marriage until one day a freak occurrence of atmospherics combined with a left over from my early life and severally disabused me of that notion. In my younger days I had been a volunteer firefighter and everywhere I went I had a pager on my belt and a scanner in my car. When I stopped fire fighting I took the scanner out of my car and set it up in my basement workshop and out of habit I would listen in on the calls while I did my woodworking. 

One day as I was cutting pieces for a cedar chest I was building I heard: 

"...and the fool is as healthy as a horse." 

"So what are you going to do?" 

"I don't know. Maybe I should try to fuck him to death. The only problem is that I can barely stand him." 

The first voice was Audrey's and the second voice was that of her best friend Hillary. Hillary was an absolute slut and didn't even attempt to hide it and I didn't like her; never had and never would, but she had been Audrey's friend since grade school and there wasn't anything I could do about it. They were talking on cell phones and conditions were just right for the scanner to pick up their conversation. Since she was on her cell that meant Audrey was probably out by the pool working on her tan. I quickly opened my briefcase and got out the micro cassette recorder and hit the RECORD button. 

"Hey girlfriend, you wanted his money, you have to take the good with the bad." 

"I'd rather take the money. The idiot adores me and ain't that a kick. I thought for sure I would catch him fucking some slut and clean him out in the divorce. The private detective followed him for a month, but all he found was that my hubby hurries home to me every night. Know where I can hire a hit man?" 

"Whoa up there Aud. You don't want to go and do something stupid. You are living a life of ease and luxury, enjoy it." 

"How can I enjoy it? I was used to having sex with three or four guys a dozen times a week and the best I can get out of doofus is a couple of times a night, three or four nights a week. I'm dying here Hill. I don't dare go out and get my ashes hauled the way I need it because I can't chance Rob finding out. If he did I'd lose everything. I have to find a way to get rid of him." 

"All I can sa...." And it faded out. 

I sat there staring at the scanner and I was devastated. I loved her and all she was was another money grubbing bitch. Not just any money grubbing bitch, but one who wouldn't mind seeing me dead. 

I was devastated, I was heartbroken, but I was also pissed and a pissed off Rob was usually bad news for whoever it was that pissed him off. When your mind isn't letting you give your full attention to what you are doing when you are working with sharp tools it is always a good move to stop. As I put my tools away I started thinking of what to do about my new situation. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When thinking of what to do to two things came immediately to mind. The first of course is that Audrey only wanted my money and the second was that she wasn't getting all the sex she wanted. Rolling those two over in my mind I came up with the basics of a plan. She wasn't getting all the sex she wanted? I would just see to it that she got even less. As far as the money was concerned I would see to it that she had gradually less and less to spend. 

I had fallen for Audrey like the proverbial ton of bricks and while I was all gaa-gaa over her I wasn't brain dead and I did get a pre-nuptial agreement signed. The pre-nup she signed had been generous. If she left me she got nothing. If I left her she got fifty thousand for every year we were together. The exception was infidelity. If I cheated on her the pre-nup was void and she could go for what she could get. If she cheated she was out on her ass without a dime. She couldn't take anything with her but what she brought to the marriage and that amounted to some clothes and her maiden name. 

I figured the problem would be a simple one to solve. I'd stop having sex with her. A woman used to having three or four men doing her a dozen times a week and who had to fall back on one man four times a week should be crawling the walls if she was getting nothing. Hopefully it would make her look for a playmate. The second thing to do was tighten things up on the money end. Audrey's easy life of leisure was about to take a hit. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

First things first. On the chance that Audrey was serious about finding a way to get rid of me so she could get my money I moved to see that if it indeed happened there would be nothing there for her. I removed her as the beneficiary on my insurance policies and changed my will leaving everything to my two brothers and three sisters. On the off chance that I might die in a legitimate accident I did leave Audrey five thousand dollars so she would have enough to put down the first and last months rent and a security deposit on an apartment. All that done I made a copy of the tape and gave it to my attorney with instructions to give it to the police if I met an untimely end. 

Next on the list was a trip to see a private detective. I chose a large firm because I was going to need a firm with a lot of manpower. I outlined my problem and explained what I wanted and asked if the firm could handle the job and I was assured that they could. What I wanted came in two parts. The first was that I wanted Audrey under surveillance from the time I left for work in the morning until I came home from work that night. 

I wanted the house wired for video and sound. I didn't expect that Audrey would do anything at the house, but it would be good to know who she talked to and what was said. Hillary and several other friends visited often and what Audrey said to them could prove interesting. I told Hank, the man I was dealing with, that I didn't care what he had to spend in getting whatever we needed. I played the tape for him and pointed out the part where she said she was afraid to go after a lover for fear that I'd find out and I told him of my plan for pushing her into looking for a lover. 

"She might get one of her friends like Hillary to allow her to meet someone at their place so you will need enough manpower to cover that possibility. For example say Audrey goes over to Hillary's and spends several hours and leaves. You will need to have enough coverage to stay on Audrey when she leaves and still have someone watching the house to see if a man leaves an hour later. Audrey may believe she is being followed and have the man already in place when she gets there." 

"We can handle that." 

"Good. The second thing I need from you is just as important to me. You heard on the tape that she has a private detective following me. What I need is for you to watch my back. I want to know if and when someone is watching me." 

"No problem. We can cover you and I'll also have my operatives watch out for anyone who looks like they mean you harm. Don't think that I didn't pick up on her references to wishing you gone." 

I handed the man a check for one hundred thousand as a retainer and told him to let me know if he needed more. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got home that night I put my plan into play. At our normal bedtime I told Audrey to go on up and that I would be along shortly. It was two hours before I went up and by then Audrey was asleep. I got up early the next morning and left for work before Audrey woke up and later that afternoon I called her and told her I would be working late and not to wait dinner on me. It would be the first time since Audrey and I married that I didn't leave the office at five and hurry home to her. Hank called me at four-thirty to let me know that I would be covered from the minute I left the building until I got home and that the operative had my cell phone number and would call me if he spotted anyone following me. 

There was a small lounge just up the street from the office and I decided to stop in and have a couple of drinks before going to a restaurant for dinner. When I walked in I saw an empty stool at the bar and I headed for it. As I waited for Mack, the bartender, to bring me my vodka tonic I glanced around the room. At a table next to the dance floor I saw five girls who worked for me and my secretary Stella was one of them. One of the girls must have noticed me and said something to Stella because she turned, looked my way and then got up and came over to me and asked me to join them. 

"No thanks Stell, I don't want to put a damper on your party." 

"There isn't any party and that's why I have come over here to get you. You will make it a party." 

"How will my going over there make it a party?" 

"Look around the place. Notice the lack of men? The girls and me want to dance and since there are no other available partners I'm volunteering you. You can look at it as being part of their company benefit package." 

She took hold of my sleeve and tugged until I got up and followed her over to the table. I had fun. I fed the jukebox and danced with all the girls. I bought several rounds of drinks and we talked, joked and laughed. One by one the girls began leaving and I found myself sitting at the table with everyone gone except Misty. She was looking at me pensively and then she asked: 

"Have you ever cheated on your wife?" 

The question caught me a little off guard and it was a second or two before I said: 

"No, I never have. Why are you asking me a question like that?" 

"Because if you did I was going to invite you to take me to the motel over on Sixth." 

"Why me?" 

"Because you are here and I am horny. You might not know it, but most of the girls at work, even some of the married ones, would like to play with you. Most don't ever see it happening, but as fantasies go it isn't a bad one." 

"I'm flattered Misty, but even if I did cheat on my wife I don't think that it is a good idea to go fishing off the company dock." 

"Well that's the thing boss, I won't be around too much longer. My family is moving to Atlanta and I'm going with them so I'll be giving my two-week notice this Friday. That's why I'm taking my shot tonight. I might never get another chance." 

I sat there and looked at Misty and thought about it. I had never been unfaithful to Audrey; I never expected I ever would be, but that was before I learned how she really felt about me. I was going to stop having sex with her to try and force her into cheating so I could throw her out with nothing, but why should I deny myself sex just to get rid of Audrey on my terms. 

Misty was a very sexy looking redhead and she was offering. "Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked. 

"Oh yeah, I'm very sure I want to do this." 

I paid the tab and Misty and I left the lounge, got in my car and drove over to the Super 8 Motel on Sixth and I got us a room. Once inside Misty didn't waste any time in getting her clothes off and as soon as she was naked she started helping me get mine off. As I stepped out of my trousers and briefs she knelt in front of me and captured my hard cock with her mouth. Misty was no stranger to giving head and she was pretty damned good at it. She had me ready to cum in no time and when I told her it was on the way and tried to pull out of her mouth she grabbed my ass and pulled me back in and the swallowed every last bit of what I spit out. She kept sucking on me until I was hard again and then she pulled me on top of her and told me to fuck her hard. 

Once in her mouth and three times in her pussy and I was done for the night. I drove her back to the lounge so she could pick up her car and before she got out of mine we exchanged a passionate kiss and made a date for the next evening after work. 

Audrey was in bed sleeping when I got home and I fell asleep smiling at the fact that I'd been laid that night and Audrey hadn't. 

I saw Misty a half dozen times before she left for Atlanta and the last time I told her that I was really going to miss her. 

"No you won't sweetie, you won't have time to miss me. I told all the other girls that you are a tiger in bed and they will all be coming at you as soon as I'm gone." 

I thought about what I'd said about fishing off the company dock and then I thought of all the sexy young things I had working for me and I thought of them coming after me and I decided to let it happen. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

On the home front Audrey was becoming extremely frustrated. I was working late (on Misty) almost every night and she was in bed asleep when I got home. Come the weekend I got up and left the house before Audrey woke up and pretended to go to work. What I did was play golf, work out at the gym and roll around on Misty's bed. After a week and a half of ignoring her I came home late one night and found Audrey waiting up for me. 

"What is going on Rob? Why are you avoiding me?" 

"Avoiding you?" 

"What else would you call it? You don't come home until after I've gone to bed and then you are up and gone before I wake up. You never used to work late and you never used to work weekends." 

I put a contrite expression on my face and said, "I'm sorry Audrey, I didn't think. I guess I should have taken the time to tell you what was going on, but I didn't want to worry you." 

"What is going on that I should worry about?" 

"I've made some bad investments Audrey and then to convince the banks I was still in good shape I cooked my books a little. The banks got suspicious and sent in an auditor and then the IRS got involved and everything is a big mess. I may end up losing it all Audrey. They way things are looking now I may end up driving a truck for a living soon. I've been working late and working weekends trying to save something. I didn't want to burden you with it." 

"What can I do to help?" 

"Just be patient with me Aud, just be patient and understanding." 

"Well, come to bed and let me see if I can't relieve the tension a little." 

It could have worked out better if I had planned it. I'd just come from spending six hours with Misty and I'd only left her place after she couldn't get me up again. Audrey tried everything she knew, but she couldn't get my dick hard. 

"I'm sorry honey, but the stress has been so heavy that I'm having all kinds of physical problems." 

Audrey went to bed frustrated and didn't I just love that. 

The next day I cancelled all of her credit cards except for one with a low limit and I asked her to watch her expenses. Next I pulled most of the cash out of the checking account and just left a thousand dollars in it. Audrey's life of leisure ground to a halt. 

Misty left and Brenda made a move on me and then Connie wanted a taste and after Connie there was Elise who was followed by my secretary Stella. Stella and I seemed to click and she became my semi-permanent squeeze. 

At home I was still avoiding Audrey. When I did get home to find her up waiting for me I had always just left one of my playmates and Audrey could never get me up. She had gone without sex for almost three months. Every Friday I would swing by the offices of Stanley Investigations and review the take from all the audio and video that had been collected that week. Audrey was doing nothing. Not a thing! All we had was her moaning and groaning to Hillary about how worthless I was, how glad she was at not having to make love to me anymore, but at the same time she was so horny she could die. 

She bemoaned the fact that I had put her on a financial leash. Hillary would commiserate and offer to help. She offered to have a couple of guys come to her place and then Audrey could stop by and visit, but Audrey said she didn't dare take the chance. 

"It pisses me off Hill, I can't even try to fuck him to death so I can inherit." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

One afternoon I got a call from Hank telling me that I needed to get over to his office right away, that there had been a major development. When I got there I was ushered into the conference room. 

"She finally did something?" I asked. 

"You need to see this for yourself. This is less than an hour old. The cameras transmit to the van down the street from your house and the man I have monitoring things got it right to me." 

He turned on the monitor and I saw Audrey and Hillary sitting at the kitchen table. I was listening to the usual shit I'd heard Audrey telling Hillary and I looked over at Hank and asked what was so special about it and he told me to just listen. On the tape Audrey had just telling Hillary that she was at the end of her rope. 

"Just hang in there a little longer Aud, it is going to get better soon." 

"How can you know that?" 

"Remember when you asked me if I knew where you could find a hit man? Well I didn't, but I know a guy who does. He owes me a few big favors so I had him set it up. Rob is going to have a fatal accident in the very near future." 

Audrey looked at Hillary with a stunned look on her face and asked: 

"Oh my God Hillary, what did you do?" 

"I got you your hit man girlfriend. Your troubles will soon be over." 

"Oh sweet Jesus Hillary, how could you do that to me?"  

===

"Isn't that what you wanted?" 

"Oh God no Hillary, that is the last thing I want. I don't ever want to see him hurt Hill, I love him." 

"You what?!!! You never have anything good to say about him Aud, how the fuck can you say you love him?" 

"That was only girlfriend talk Hill. You have never liked him so I've just said what you wanted to hear. I didn't mean one word of it." 

"Well you shouldn't have sounded so much like you meant it because you sure had me convinced." 

"Call your friend Hill, do it right now, right now and call off your hit man." 

"I don't know if I can." 

"You fucking better be able to Hill; if anything happens to Rob I'll kill you. I swear to God Hill, one hair on his head gets hurt I'll kill you." 

"Whoa Aud, don't panic, I'll do it." 

Hillary took her cell phone out of her purse and punched in a number. 

"Harry? Hillary here. Hey lover, you know that favor I asked you for?" 

"Yeah, that one. I was mistaken; she doesn't really want it done." 

"Okay, call me back and let me know." 

She disconnected and dropped the phone back in her purse. "See? No problem." 

Audrey just sat there with her head in her hands. Finally she looked up. "How could you do that Hill? How could you do something like that?" 

"Hey Aud, you're my best bud; I'd do anything for you, you know that. I thought that was what you wanted and when I found out I could make it happen I went for it." 

"Jesus God I hope he never finds out about this, he would leave me for sure." 

"No he won't, not if he loves you." 

"Yeah? Well maybe he won't love me anymore when he finds out I almost got him killed." 

Hillary's phone started beeping and she answered it. 

"Hello?" 

"Yeah Harry. Is it taken care of?" 

"What!! Oh shit. Keep trying Harry, keep trying." 

She disconnected and said, "We have a problem. Harry can't call it off." 

"What? Why not?" 

"The guy he set it up with has gone out of town and Harry doesn't know where he is." 

"Oh shit. What are we going to do?" 

"I told Harry to keep on trying." 

"But what if this hit man is already after Rob?" 

"All we can do is hope that Harry finds him before he can do anything." 

"That's not good enough Hillary; Rob's in danger. Just leave Hillary; just get out of here. I need to figure out what to do. There has to be something I can do." 

"You could call him and warn him." 

"Oh sure, right! I can see it now. "And how do you know I'm in danger Audrey?" "Because I kind of accidentally got a hit man out looking for you." He would leave me in a heartbeat." 

"But he would still be alive Aud. How much do you love him? Enough to see him alive even if he isn't with you?" 

"Oh shit Hillary, how could you do this to me." 

"I'll keep trying Aud, I'll keep after Harry" and she walked out of the picture. 

Audrey picked up the glass she had been drinking out of and threw it across the room where it smashed into the wall. "Shit, shit, shit!" she yelled and got up and hurried from the room. 

I turned to Hank, "Now what?" 

"She ran out of the house, got in her car and she is headed for town. My man is on her, but so far all he knows is that she is headed for town" 

Just then his phone rang and he picked it up. 

"Gleason." 

"Yeah? What have you got?" 

"Okay, wait one." 

He covered the mouthpiece with his hand and said, "She just pulled up at your building." 

"Tell your man to stay put and watch her car." 

I took my cell phone out of my pocket and called the office. 

"Stella?" 

"My wife is on the way up. When she gets there don't let her leave. I don't care if you have to sit on her, keep her there until I get there." 

I told Hank to follow me and I ran from the building. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got off the elevator on the fifth floor Audrey saw me and she ran to me and threw her arms around me. 

"You're safe, thank God you're safe. I need to talk to you baby, it's important. Can we go in your office?" 

As we entered my office she noticed Hank following along and she said, "I need to talk to you in private Rob." 

"Anything you want to say can be said in front of Hank. He's my bodyguard and he goes everywhere I go." 

"Bodyguard? I don't understand." 

"Well Aud, when I got the idea you wanted me dead I felt that it would be prudent to get some protection." 

"I wanted you dead? Are you crazy?" 

"You tell me," I said as I took the recorder out of my briefcase and hit the play button. 

"Know where I can hire a hit man?" the recorder spat out and Audrey moaned, "Oh my God" and the life seemed to go out of her and she slumped down in a chair. 

"So what is this important thing you need to talk to me about?" 

She lifted her head and looked at me and after a second she said, "I came down here to warn you that your life is in danger" and she started crying. She got up to leave, but Hank put himself between her and the door and I got up from behind my desk, went to her and put my arms around her. 

"Let me go." 

"No, I don't think so." 

"Damn it, let me go!" 

"No Audrey, I won't." 

"You don't understand. It is because of me. I put you in danger." 

"I know Aud, but it is all right. You didn't mean to and I know it. We will be all right, I promise." 

"You know? What do you mean, you know?" 

"Just sit back down and I'll tell you all about it." 

I played the full recording for her, told her how I'd gotten it and then I told her how I had wired the house to keep track of her and hired Hank's company to watch her and watch my back. She sat there and stared at me stunned, so stunned that she didn't even realize that her cell phone was ringing until I called her attention to it. She took it out of her purse and answered it. It was Hillary calling to say that the matter had been taken care off. 

"You're shitting me," she said. 

"Well I hope you never give that bastard a taste." 

"Okay. I'll call you later. I may need a place to stay for a while." 

She disconnected and put her phone back into her purse. "There never was a hit man. Harry wanted to get into Hillary's pants and he told her he could set up a hit man to thinking it would help him get on her good side." 

"What was that part about needing a place to stay?" 

"I'm certainly not going home with you after what you've done." 

"After what I've done?" 

"I thought you loved me. How could you possibly believe that I would do what you were thinking I was doing?" 

"How in the hell could I not believe it. It is on the tape. It is on every piece of audio and video I have of you talking to Hillary. I didn't hear you once say, "Just kidding Hill,' not once." 

"So what Rob? You don't like Hillary and never have so I keep my relationship with her to myself. I am with her the way I always am when I'm with her and what I say is for her. I can't explain it any better than that. She doesn't like you anymore than you like her so when I'm with her I tell her what she wants to hear. All you ever had to do was confront me with that tape and demand an explanation. And I would have cleared things up for you." 

"Why would I have accepted your explanation as the truth. Why would I have not thought that you were lying to cover things up?" 

"I don't know Rob, but I would have expected you to try if you really loved me. I suppose this is why you haven't made love to me in months?" 

I shook my head yes. 

"And the money problems, that fake too?" 

Again I nodded a yes. 

"What was the plan Rob, what were you trying to accomplish? 

She stared at me for a couple of seconds while I tried to think of how to best answer her and then she said: 

"You don't have to tell me, the tape did. You heard the part about me being used to having sex with a lot of guys and you thought cutting me off would make me go out and get a lover. That's why you were having me watched, isn't it. You wanted to catch me cheating." 

She stood up. "Isn't that the shits. I came down here to tell you I had put your life in danger fully expecting that you would leave me when I was done and all the time you were looking for a way to get rid of me. Goodbye Rob." She turned and headed for the door. 

"Where are you going?" 

"Away from you Rob." 

"Be reasonable Audrey. Hillary believed you and she was looking you right in the eye when you told her what you did and she has known you and been close to you one hell of a lot longer than I have. After what I heard on the tapes how could I have believed you didn't mean it." 

"I don't know Rob, but it doesn't matter now. I could never live with you knowing that you believed me capable of hurting you." 

And then she was out the door and gone. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got home I found Audrey's wedding ring on the kitchen table along with her key to the house along with a note telling me she would drop off the car as soon as she got it unloaded. Her clothes were gone and she had left behind every piece of jewelry I'd given her. 

She refused to answer my calls and ten days later I was served with divorce papers. She claimed irreconcilable differences and asked for nothing except out of the marriage. She won't see me, she won't talk to me and when I told my attorney to pass the word to her through her attorney that I was going to keep fighting the divorce until she at least sat down and talked with me. 

She sent back word that she didn't care if the divorce went through or not since all it would do for her was free her up so she could get married again and she had no plans to do that. Then she threw in the kicker. She sent me a picture of her with two guys. One was in her mouth and the other was fucking her from behind. The one in her mouth was holding up a newspaper showing me that it was last Sunday's paper. Audrey enclosed a note with the picture; it said: 

"Here you go Rob, just what you were looking for." 

I called my lawyer and told him to let the divorce proceed. Report_Story
