 ****** Obedience: A Study in Seduction ****** bysilkstockingsloverÂ© Summary: 2 powerful women seduce straight women in different ways. 

 Note 1: Thanks to hfernandez1983 for the original idea to what turned out to be a very lengthy, complex NOVELLA, in the vein, I hope, of my Catching_Mommy series except without the incest (mostly). 

 Note 2: Thanks to Robert, Tenzin, Goamz86, and Wayne for editing. 

 This was originally released a couple days ago as 2 Mistresses: A Study of Seduction. But to my incompetence, I sent in a fix before it was released to fix a plot error and part way through the first day of release part 2 (unedited) replaced the original part 1. 

 So if you have already read this... sorry. But I didn't realize what the error was until after I got it removed. I then realized it was the right story for a day and then altered to the second chapter. 

 Confusing... I know. 

 This is the original story... 

 Obedience: A Study on Seduction 

 CAROLYN ADAMS 

 Carolyn had not brought her assistant on this trip as she decided it was time to find some fresh young meat and was thus planning to give her a promotion soon to her Tokyo office. 

 Carolyn had been working so hard of late her sexual needs had not been met regularly and being in Los Angeles, where the quota was the highest for lost women unknowingly looking for a Mistress, she decided to start her search for her next assistant or at the very least a one night stand. 

 Carolyn often used her assistant to find young girls for her while on her travels, but today she felt compelled to go on the hunt. 

 Being a CEO of a major worldwide internet company gave her plenty of opportunity to meet women who were willing and eager to do whatever it took to climb the business ladder. Being 2015, women were just as likely, if not more likely, to eat a pussy as a cock to get ahead. Sex was money in the business world and the more willing one was to use it to their advantage the more likely they were to climb the business ladder. 

 Carolyn had no idea how many women she had had between her legs, hundreds for sure, but even that number was rather conservative. From the first time she seduced a woman, her Biology teacher, and made her an obedient plaything for the rest of her senior year, she had practiced her trade... a trade of seducing as many women as possible. 

 Carolyn believed a few things about sex: 

 1. All women are sexual beings and have dark desires that are often kept hidden deep inside and never allowed to be explored. 

 2. All women see sex as an intimate way to explore their true selves. 

 3. All women fantasize, regardless of how happy they are in their relationship. Of course, single women fantasize too. 

 4. All women find other women attractive and if not consciously, at least subconsciously fantasize about a sapphic liaison. 

 5. All women are looking for sex as an escape from their busy, overwhelming lives. Most women work and are expected to also be the motherly figure at home and a sophisticated lady at work and in public. 

 6. All women who allow themselves to explore their true sexuality, live out their darkest fantasies, accept their complex sexuality and plethora of needs will be truly free from the male hierarchy women are forced to live in. 

 7. Almost all women are submissive by nature and by society's expectations. Regardless of how hard women fight for true equality, they are built to please. The rare woman who isn't submissive must guide the flock to their true sexual identity and protect them from the sins and abuse of men. 

 Carolyn believed she was born for a greater purpose... to liberate as many women from the chains of ludicrous social morals that few men actually lived (cheating and homosexual activity still rampant behind the scenes of the so- called business world). 

 She discovered through her years of experience that almost every woman will submit to another woman given the right circumstances and opportunity. 

 Sometimes Carolyn was sweet and tender; other times powerful and dominant; other times a balance of the two. Yet, almost without fail, once Carolyn set her eyes on a woman they inevitably ended up between her legs. 

 Carolyn had submissives in hundreds of cities who would meet her at a moment's notice even years after their first encounter. 

 Her gift of seduction, of discipline, brought almost any woman to her knees and made them lifelong submissives to her and usually eager pussy pleasers for life as well. 

 Over the years she had many amazing encounters: 

 -A very famous princess going down on her during the coronation of her brother. 

 

 -The daughter and mother team of the President of an important country that pleasured her together regularly during his time as President. 

 -Nineteen Miss America pageant winners in a row (and over a hundred contestants)... as well as four other Miss World winners. 

 -Her own mother when she was just eighteen (incest being just another of society's judgemental moral views that were more common behind the scenes than people would ever know). 

 -Her entire college sorority including the den mother and a few alumni. 

 -A couple dozen big name female celebrities (names not disclosed for obvious reasons)... her business giving her access to celebrity women in all fields of popularity. 

 -Her brother's wife before the wedding and again during the evening ceremony. 

 -Dozens of coeds throughout the years. 

 -Many other CEO's and every female employee in her company as well as the majority of the designers scattered throughout the world who provided top of the line designs for her online store. 

 -Wives of many male CEOs as well as a few of their daughters. 

 Carolyn's biggest turn on was turning a straight girl regardless of her age. She had seduced women from the age eighteen to sixty-three (although that was a special one, being an Oscar winner just minutes after she won the Oscar). 

 She loved seeing a woman admit to her long ignored sexual desires and curiosity. 

 She loved seeing a woman willingly drop to their knees. 

 She loved seeing a woman, hands often trembling, undress in front of her. 

 She loved the look in a woman's eyes when she first tasted her addictive honey. 

 

 She loved the tentativeness of a new submissive, almost always followed by eagerness, and a final acceptance that this was their natural place... their years or decades of denied desire finally breaking through. 

 Carolyn perused the hotel bar. A classy little place where a dress code was mandatory. 

 Every woman there was dressed in a cocktail gown and Carolyn noticed that only three of the women actually accentuated their attire with nylons. 

 'What a pity,' she sighed to herself. She had watched as women got lazier over the years. In the eighties when she was in high school nylons were always worn by teachers, and by many students, herself included. Slowly, this piece of attire, meant to accentuate a woman's legs, were worn less and less by women. They were still mandatory in most government positions, the royal family, as well as all her employees and, of course, her submissives. 

 She believed nylons, pantyhose for her employees and thigh highs for her pets, were a symbol of sexuality. 

 In business, pantyhose are professional and still sexy. 

 In the bedroom, thigh highs were sensual and allowed easy access to the sweet honey that only women were given the gift to expel. 

 Horny, it was rare Carolyn went two days without a pet between her legs, she made her choice. A young girl, she liked them young, was sitting at the bar by herself. She was also one of the three wearing pantyhose. Carolyn walked over to black haired beauty and asked, "Anyone sitting beside you?" 

 "No, ma'am," the girl responded, startled by the question, waiting for her so- called meeting. 

 "Ma'am," Carolyn chuckled playfully, charm on full, "Please, I hate such terms that infer age. My name is Carolyn." 

 "Oh, I'm sorry," she apologized. "My parents taught me at a young age to always be polite." 

 Carolyn was already giddy at the obviousness that this young girl was ripe for the turning. She agreed, looking into the unique not green, not blue eyes, "I must agree with your parents. But, I'd still prefer Carolyn." 

 "Of course, it's nice to meet you Carolyn," the girl greeted, finding something very comfortable about this woman, even though she couldn't explain it. 

 "Nice to meet you too," Carolyn smiled, taking her hand and shaking it, all the while moving her thumb ever so subtly on the young girl's hand... just a sly moment of intimacy. "I assume you have a name." 

 "Oh, sorry," Mindy giggled like the southern young girl she was. "It's Mindy." 

 "Texas?" Carolyn asked, pretty good at placing accents. 

 "Born and raised," Mindy nodded, wondering if her accent was that obvious. 

 "Can I get you another drink?" Carolyn asked, as she waved her hand to the bartender. 

 "Um, sure," Mindy nodded, never having had a drink bought for her by another woman. She had many men buy her drinks, all with the same purpose, to fuck her. Mindy came to Los Angeles like so many others... to be an actress. And although she had gotten a couple of minor roles in commercials and one music video, she had yet to hit it big. 

 Mindy was actually here, at this overpriced overdressed bar, dressed in her most extravagant attire, to meet a movie producer who was supposedly interested in her for a lead role. That said, the last two times such a promise was made, it was once for porn and the other time the guy wasn't even a producer. 

 Mindy, doing her due diligence after the last two disasters, researched the guy and he was legit... at least in that he was a producer with one low budget movie under his belt. That said, he was an hour late. 

 Carolyn ordered drinks and noticing that Mindy seemed distracted asked, "Are you waiting for someone?" 

 "I am," Mindy sighed, "but he's an hour late." 

 "Men!" Carolyn joked, although she meant it. Men were utterly useless to her, except a few gay designers, and one straight designer. If it wasn't for the invention of pantyhose by Allen Gant, Sr., and the requirement for their sperm to populate the race, she had no use for them. 

 "Yeah," Mindy nodded, as she finished her eighteen dollar drink. The only one she could afford to buy. Actually, she couldn't afford one, but needed to at least look like she belonged here. 

 "I'll keep you company until he arrives," Carolyn smiled, sensing a very vulnerable young woman just looking for a Mistress, even though the young girl didn't know it yet. 

 "If he arrives," Mindy said, although it was nice to have someone to talk to. 

 "So tell me about yourself," Carolyn began, knowing that knowledge is power. She always tried to know everything she could about the people she was about to seduce, as well as her employees. 

 "Not much to tell," Mindy shrugged. She told her about her dreams of becoming an actress and was either laughed at, given a lot of pity, or told that she needed to find a real career. Actually, those were exactly the last words her father used when she left. 

 "Oh, honey," Carolyn smiled warmly, putting her hand on the young girl's nylon- clad leg, the second seemingly innocent, but perfectly strategic, touch. "I'm guessing you've been told a million times to stop trying to live the dream." 

 Mindy was surprised by the sudden hand on her knee, but equally surprised by the accurate words of the woman. She nodded, "Is it that obvious?" 

 "I can tell by your tone you don't want to be rejected again," Carolyn said, giving a gentle squeeze on the prey's knee and then moving her hand away to take a drink. Always leave them wanting more... and usually questioning themselves as to why they wanted more, was advice given to her years ago and advice she had taken to heart. 

 "It's a tough town," Mindy nodded, feeling so safe and comfortable with this motherly figure... although she somehow knew she didn't have any kids. 

 "The toughest," Carolyn nodded, although truth be told New York was just as tough for different reasons. "Are you here alone in this wacky city?" 

 "Yes," Mindy nodded. "I'm a long way from home." 

 "Home is where you make it," Carolyn said, spending half her year, give or take, in the finest hotels in the world. 

 "I suppose," Mindy said, as the bartender returned with drinks. She took a sip and asked, "Are you from here?" 

 "God, no," Carolyn responded. "I live in the other pretentious city in this country." 

 "Washington?" Mindy questioned. 

 Carolyn couldn't tell if she was serious or just witty, but she laughed, "Now that is funny. I guess I live in one of the other pretentious cities in America, New York." 

 "Oh, Houston is a pretty close fourth," Mindy smiled. 

 "Well, I'm a lot of things," Carolyn said, returning her hand to the girl's knee, "but pretentious isn't one of them." 

 Mindy laughed, even as she felt a rush up her spine that didn't make any a sense, "Good to know." 

 "Are you an actress?" Carolyn asked, even though the answer was obvious. 

 "In a perfect world," Mindy nodded. "Although based on my length of unemployment I can't really call myself one." 

 Carolyn moved her hand away again, playing a classic game of cat and mouse. "Let me guess. You're also a waitress." 

 "Sadly, it almost pays the bills," Mindy nodded, impressed by this intriguing pretty woman. 

 Carolyn laughed, "I remember those days," although truth be told, she didn't. 

 "You were an actress?" Mindy asked. 

 Carolyn put her hand on the sweet girl's leg again. "Oh, we are all actresses." 

 

 "Pardon?" Mindy questioned, confused both by the answer as well as the feelings of warmth that coursed through her when the older woman's hand went back onto her knee. Was she hitting on her? Or was she just really friendly? 

 "Women are always acting. Playing a part in a man's world," Carolyn responded. She was confident that pushing feminism while criticizing the sexist life of Los Angeles would pull the young woman even closer to her. 

 "I guess," Mindy shrugged. Although in retrospect, the older woman's words made sense as back home and definitely in Los Angeles it was a man's world. 

 "That is one of the reasons I started my own business," Carolyn nodded, giving another hint of what she had in store later, "I like to be in control." As she said those final words she again gave a squeeze on the sweet girl's knee... this time it had an undoubtable meaning. 

 Mindy was confused. She wasn't surprised to get hit on, that happened all the time... even a couple times by women. But, this was the first time she wasn't disgusted and uncomfortable (well, she was uncomfortable, but more so because of her confusion of her feelings). Somehow the woman was creating feelings inside her that she wasn't used to. 

 "What kind of company?" Mindy asked, allowing the woman to keep her hand on her leg. 

 "It's an online store aimed at woman only," Carolyn said, her hand sliding, ever so slowly, like a lost snail, up the pretty girl's nylon clad leg. 

 "Oh really?" Mindy asked, so intrigued by this woman she was not moving away from the gentle, intimate touch. She was also curious what kind of online store would be only for women. 

 Carolyn knew she had her. She had set up the seduction well and was well on her way to accomplishing her goal. Many asked her over the years how she was so successful at seducing straight women and also almost always having them coming back for more. It was actually quite simple. She had taken psychology in college as an elective and what a great one it was. It was there she learned of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and used it as her basis for seduction. 

 The five stage hierarchy was both fascinating and almost always right. The bottom element is the physiological needs. This one is obviously the stepping stone to the others. It is, simply put, the physical requirements for human survival. These needs of a guarantee of clothing, shelter and food are incumbent to the ability for any person, man or woman, to allow themselves to take the risks needed to explore their true sexuality. 

 Often these needs were already met for women she was seducing, but for Mindy, Carolyn knew that she could enhance the sweet girl's physiology by offering her a job. It was obvious she was struggling to get by and her physiological needs were not being met adequately. Her sense of love and belonging and her self- esteem were clearly at rock bottom or close to it and Carolyn was confident she could build all those needs for this lost young girl. 

 "On that note, I just thought of something," Carolyn said. 

 "What?" Mindy asked. 

 "I am in the process of creating some online commercials for a few of my new products and was supposed to be in New York on Friday for the auditions," Carolyn continued, reeling the young girl in with a mixture of her words, her look and her slow tease as her hand moved up slyly again. 

 Mindy was overwhelmed. She felt the woman's hand moving up her leg. She also heard the woman potentially offering her a job. Yet, she had rejected the advances of men for jobs in the past. Trying to be non-committal, she asked, "What kind of products?" 

 Carolyn answered, "A couple. A new line of lingerie from a young, hip lesbian from Paris, and," she paused for dramatic effect, "a new line of sex toys for women, especially couples." 

 "Lesbian couples?" Mindy asked, her pussy undeniably wet. 

 "Yes," Carolyn nodded. "I cater to the growing lesbian market in the world. Thus why online is so convenient." 

 "Oh," Mindy nodded, the woman's hand now at the hem of her dress. 

 Suddenly, just as Carolyn was going to offer her a job, a male voice interrupted them. 

 "Are you Mindy?" The male voice said. 

 Mindy looked up, startled; her head in a strange wonderland that was swirling inside her. "Um, yes, yes, I am." 

 "Sorry, I'm so late," the very good looking man said, "Shooting went longer than expected." 

 "On what?" Carolyn asked, her hand still on the young prey's leg, her fingers now just going under the dress. 

 The man looked at Carolyn and said, "I'm directing a pilot for NBC." 

 "Very nice," Carolyn smiled, playing nice, even as she tried to keep Mindy reeled in. She could sense that Mindy was special and that she would be a great addition to her firm and, conversely, that Mindy desperately needed her. 

 "Can I buy you two a drink?" The male asked, wondering if he could smooth his way into a threesome. 

 "No, no," Carolyn said, "I need to get going anyways. But could you give us a minute?" 

 "Sure," he nodded, disappointed about the quick squelching of a potential threesome, but happy about just how hot today's potential playmate was. 

 Once he was gone, Carolyn said, "You should likely go and meet with him." 

 "I probably should," Mindy nodded, even though oddly, she suddenly wasn't excited to meet with him, even though that was why she had come to this overpriced lounge in the first place. She couldn't explain it, but she wanted to stay with this woman. 

 "If it goes well, great," Carolyn said, her hand going under the dress but not past the inner thigh (a clear implication of intent, but a tease that would leave the young straight woman rattled and wanting more), "But if it doesn't, and you want to chat some more, I'm in the penthouse suite." 

 "You are?" Mindy asked, her pussy tingling with excitement, as she inadvertently opened her legs slightly... her body willing to allow this older woman to touch her where no woman ever had. 

 "I only want the best of everything, Mindy," Carolyn said, sliding her hand out from underneath the girl's dress, and standing up. "And I think you may very well fit into the descriptor." 

 Mindy was speechless. She looked up at the pretty woman, a sudden disappointment that she was leaving filling her. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** Obedience: A Study in Seduction ****** bysilkstockingsloverÂ© Carolyn leaned in, her hot breath on the young woman's neck and ear. She whispered, her tone dripping with sexual implication, "The password to get to the penthouse is 'I will obey'." 

 Mindy moaned softly, her strongest erogenous zone her neck. With the three words, every last lingering doubt of what this older woman wanted was gone. 

 Carolyn turned and walked away, always leave them wanting more. She didn't look back, she just kept walking, knowing that, without a doubt, Mindy watched her leave. 

 Mindy watched the pretty woman leave, her panties now incredibly damp. She took a deep breath, her head spinning, her body lusting and walked over to the very handsome man. Usually, she was giddy with excitement and hope, yet this time she wasn't going to play the game. She was going to be frank with him. 

 Carolyn switched into something more comfortable. She stayed in her black thigh highs (the colour of power in her mind), her matching black thong and bra and put on a robe. She glanced at the clock, 9:04. If she was right, and she usually was, Mindy would be here within an hour... likely half that. 

 Mindy barely listened to the guy talk. He seemed genuine, yet she couldn't stop thinking about Carolyn. There was something about her that wouldn't leave her. Everything about the woman was intriguing and the three word password to enter the penthouse suite only added to the aura of the woman. 

 "So are you interested?" the man asked. 

 Mindy had no idea what he last said. But deciding to be blunt, she asked, "Look, I don't mean to come off as a bitch, but I need to be frank here. I have no intention of fucking you tonight." 

 The look on the guy's face whose name Mindy had already forgotten (Carolyn having really done a number on her), told her this was another hoax meeting. 

 Mindy stood up and said, "Thanks for the drink," and walked away. 

 The guy said, pissed off, "You bitch. You will never work in this town again." 

 Mindy kept walking, hoping that her next job was going to be in New York. She went right to the elevator and was surprised to see a bellhop in it. She had no idea such things existed anymore. 

 "What floor, ma'am?" the bellhop asked. 

 Mindy froze. Suddenly she was filled with anxiety. What had she just done? Had she really thrown away her acting career to go upstairs and maybe have sex with a woman? 

 The bellhop repeated. "Ma'am, what floor?" 

 Mindy knew it was now or never. If she walked out of the elevator, she was also walking out of Los Angeles and her dream to be an actress. If she said Penthouse, she was potentially going to submit to a woman. She was confused, but made a decision. "Penthouse please." 

 "Password?" He asked. 

 "I will obey," Mindy answered, as she figured she would just go up and hear more about the modelling gig. Going up didn't mean she was going to have sex with a woman. She wasn't a lesbian. But she was curious... which made her chuckle at the pun. 

 "Yes, ma'am," the bellhop nodded as he pressed the penthouse button. 

 As the elevator rose, Mindy's head and body were swirling with emotions. Excited at the possibility of a job. Nervousness at the thought this woman may expect sex with her. Trepidation at the reality the idea of sex for a job, correct that, sex with this woman for a job, was actually not an impossibility. 

 

 Her panties were damp. Her head was light. Her mind was made... 

 As the elevator opened, she was surprised to realize it opened to the suite itself. That meant she had the entire floor. 

 She tentatively walked into the massive spread; once again, she was overwhelmed... and impressed. Carolyn obviously was a very successful woman. 

 That said, she didn't see Carolyn anywhere. She wasn't sure what to do. 

 Carolyn heard the elevator open and smiled. 9:28... Even earlier than she had anticipated. She waited a moment, deciding to make the eager pet wait. 

 Eventually, she slipped on her five inch heels, left the master bedroom and went to finish the seduction. 

 Mindy was having second thoughts (or third, fourth and fifth thoughts) and was considering leaving when Carolyn greeted, "I'm so happy you could make it. The meeting didn't go well?" 

 Mindy instantly felt giddy as she heard her voice and saw that she was now in a robe. Mindy answered, "No, he was a leech." 

 "Most men are," Carolyn nodded, as she went to the bottle of wine chilling and asked, "Can I get you a drink, my dear?" 

 "Yes, ma'am," Mindy replied like she had the first time, hoping one more glass of wine would calm the nerves. 

 Carolyn liked the subservient respectful use of the word 'ma'am' this time, and allowed it. She poured two glasses of wine and walked over to Mindy, who was still standing near the elevator. "Come on in, my dear." 

 Mindy followed Carolyn into the massive spread of what was apparently the living room. She said, trying to make small talk, "This is the most extravagant room I've ever seen." 

 Carolyn nodded, "I believe I deserve only the best and this is the best penthouse in the city." 

 "What a great way to be able to live," Mindy said impressed, her apartment was tiny and shared with two other striving wannabe actresses. 

 "You could live this way too," Carolyn said, as she sat down on the couch and crossed her legs, the top of her lace top thigh highs in clear view for the young lady. 

 "I can't imagine," Mindy said, as she sat across from Carolyn and noticed the sexy nylons. 

 "Come sit with me, my dear," Carolyn offered, patting a spot beside her. 

 "Oh, okay," Mindy nodded, standing up and then obediently joining the confident woman. 

 "So have you considered my offer?" Carolyn asked. 

 "I wasn't completely clear on the offer, ma'am," Mindy said. "Were you offering me a chance to audition for your new online commercials?" 

 "Oh, I guess I wasn't clear," Carolyn smiled, her hand returning once again to the young lady's nylon-clad knee. She now moved to the second level of Maslow's hierarchy, the safety needs. Carolyn was about to offer personal and financial security, which often led to good health and well-being. "I was offering you a full time job working under me." The innuendo was blunt. 

 Mindy again felt chills go up her spine. 

 Mindy again felt her panties dampen with excited wetness. 

 Mindy again felt her head go light. 

 Mindy took a long sip of her wine as she tried to deal with her conflicting emotions. 

 Carolyn continued the aggressive attack. "Mindy, if you decide to take my job offer, you will move in with me." 

 "I will?" Mindy asked, surprised by that. 

 "Yes, I will pay all your expenses to move. You will live rent free in my home, and have your own, very spacious and furnished, room," Carolyn continued. 

 "Oh," was all Mindy said, the offer sounding too good to be true. 

 Tempting the sweet girl with more of her currently unsatisfied safety needs she added, "I will also pay off any debt you have currently accumulated and pay you 200,000 dollars a year." 

 Mindy's eyes went big. 200,000 dollars? Her increasing growing debt paid off? A full time job? This was definitely too good to be true. She finally asked, "And what does the job entail?" 

 Carolyn's hand moved up slightly on Mindy's leg as she continued, "You would be my full time twenty-four travelling assistant." She already had a live-in maid and assistant in Carmen back at home. 

 "What about my acting?" Mindy asked, her body burning at the woman's soft touch. 

 "You will also be the face and body of my new lingerie and toy line," Carolyn nodded, knowing that she needed to tie the third and fourth level of Maslow's theory, love and belonging, with Mindy's safety needs. It was obvious that Mindy was alone in Los Angeles and in dire need of a feeling of belonging. And in Carolyn's treatment of all her pets, there was a love and belonging, an intimacy built on trust and need and lastly a foundation of family (although not in sense of the most common dictionary definition). As well, by offering her a job, her clearly low self-esteem, beaten down by the harsh Los Angeles lifestyle, would be reclaimed. As Carolyn had learned from experience, if the first four steps on the hierarchy were met, the pet could begin her search for the ultimate goal of any person... self-actualization. That one, though, takes years to accomplish. 

 "You would do that?" Mindy asked, completely drawn in with the opportunity being offered. 

 "I would and I can," Carolyn nodded, her hand again going slightly under the dress of her pet-to-be. 

 "But I have to move to New York?" Mindy asked, as she glanced down at the hand slowly disappearing under her dress, inching closer to her very, very wet panties. 

 "You would indeed," Carolyn nodded, "you would move in with me and also travel wherever I went. You would be my live-in and travelling full-time assistant." 

 "Everywhere?" Mindy asked. 

 "Paris, Milan, Rome, London, Toronto, Tokyo, Delhi, and Moscow in the next three months," Carolyn listed, her jet setting ways always an enticing perk to a pet. 

 "I've never left America," Mindy admitted. 

 "The photo shoot for the fashion line is in Paris," Carolyn revealed, smiling at how close she was to taking the young girl in. Changing subjects she said, "I would buy you an entire new wardrobe, of course, as you would only wear designs from my catalogue. And we would definitely get rid of these cheap pantyhose and put you in classy ones." 

 "I bought them at a drugstore," Mindy admitted, feeling oddly like Cinderella at the possibility of a complete makeover. 

 "Oh my," Carolyn said. She moved her hand out from underneath Mindy's dress and took her hand. She moved it to her own silk clad leg and asked, "Can you feel the difference?" 

 "Wow!" Mindy nodded, as she felt the super silky material and also the reality that her hand was on another woman's leg. 

 "I know," Carolyn nodded, watching the pet-to-be's intrigued facial expression, "These are the silkiest stockings in the world, and not yet even available for purchase." 

 "They are amazing," Mindy said, as she moved her hand up and down slowly, in awe of how soft and sexy they were. 

 Carolyn stood up and instructed, "Wait here." 

 "Yes, ma'am," Mindy nodded, as Carolyn left the big room. This was just enough time to compose herself. Her pussy was still dying for attention and she still had no idea what Carolyn really wanted. She assumed sex, but Mindy wasn't sure what that actually meant between two women. Licking pussy, fingering, toys? She had no experience other than a roommate who was bi and had shown her a few toys she had used on other girls... That, at the time, disgusted her as she was a very straight girl. But now... she wasn't so sure. 

 Mindy finished her glass of wine just as Carolyn returned with a package. 

 Carolyn ordered, "Put these on," as she handed the package of beige stockings to Mindy. 

 Mindy took the package and asked, excited to have a pair of such quality pantyhose, "Where is the bathroom in this massive spread?" 

 "There are actually three," Carolyn pointed out, before adding, "but you can change here." 

 "Really?" Mindy asked. 

 "If you are going to be my assistant we will see each other, and many other women, naked," Carolyn explained. 

 "Oh," Mindy nodded, nervous to get undressed at all in front of another woman. Yet, she did it. She took her pantyhose off, self-consciously careful to not flash her panties or ass to Carolyn. 

 Carolyn watched the sweet girl change hosiery, knowing from experience new clothes, especially sexy hosiery, built a woman's self-esteem, self-worth, and thus automatically their own sexual confidence. 

 Mindy surprisingly began to not feel self-conscious about her body or being watched by another woman as she began to put on the nylons which she soon realized were thigh highs like she noticed Carolyn was wearing. As she slid the super silk up her legs, she felt decadent and rich... A little like Eliza Doolittle in her favourite play. 

 Carolyn watched with a sly smile, noticing her pet-to-be's awe at the sheer silk and how her nervousness seemed to fade as she put on the extravagant thigh highs. 

 Once both thigh highs were on, Mindy looked up at Carolyn and said, "I feel like a princess." 

 "Most princesses wear nylons every day, notice Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge?" Carolyn said, "She is always in pantyhose. Pantyhose equals power and symbolizes elegance and money." 

 "What about these thigh highs?" Mindy asked, actually modelling them. 

 Carolyn smiled at how sexy and yet eager this young woman was. "They are the epitome of women reclaiming their sexuality, while still being powerful beings in society." 

 "I do feel sexy," Mindy nodded. 

 "How old are you Mindy?" Carolyn asked. 

 "Twenty-one," Mindy answered. 

 "Are you ready for your job interview?" Carolyn asked, moving to her purse on a table. 

 "Um, yes," Mindy nodded, feeling ready for whatever was about to happen. 

 "It will be a very thorough interview," Carolyn warned. 

 "I understand," Mindy trembled in anticipation. 

 Carolyn took her phone out of her purse, pressed record and asked, "Full name please." 

 "Mindy Allison Rogers," Mindy answered. 

 Carolyn sat down and patted the spot beside her. Mindy obediently went and sat beside her. 

 "Would you consider yourself a risk taker?" Carolyn asked, smiling at the obedience of the pretty woman. 

 Mindy pondered this. The correct answer she was likely looking for was 'yes', yet the truth was other than coming to Los Angeles to follow her dream, she definitely was more conservative. She answered, "Honestly, until coming to LA and into this room, I have lived my life rather conservatively." 

 "Interesting," Carolyn nodded, most submissives are only risk takers when pushed. After a pause, she asked, "Have you ever been in love?" 

 Another hard question. The truth was that she thought she had met the man she was going to marry in high school. Dave and she dated from freshman year until one month before graduation, a few days after prom when she refused to fuck him, but then he betrayed her with her best friend... which was the other reason for the move to Los Angeles... to start anew, and get away from the two people she loved the most, who had both betrayed her. Mindy answered, "I thought I was in my senior year, but that was a facade." 

 Carolyn could see the hurt in the young girl's eyes and knew instantly that the hurt was recent, harsh and she wasn't yet over it. It only added to the reason she was the perfect prey... she was questioning love and herself. Carolyn asked, "You've recently been betrayed." 

 "Yes, ma'am," Mindy nodded, again in awe of the constant correct assessments of this woman. 

 "Tell me about it," Carolyn said, as she again put her hand on the leg of Mindy, before adding, "this is much better." 

 "It is a lot softer," Mindy nodded, liking having the woman's hand back on her leg. Mindy retold the entire betrayal, catching them in the act, his lame excuse that she wouldn't put out, even though she sucked him regularly, and the awkwardness of the entire school knowing. 

 Carolyn couldn't believe how much Maslow's theory fit this young girl. Mindy was desperate for the loving and belonging that she could give her. An unconditional, if unorthodox, love that created an external bond that transcended the social generic expectations of love and happiness. 

 "This may come out of the blue, but it is an important question," Carolyn said, "Do you swallow?" 

 It was out of the blue, yet it somehow didn't surprise Mindy. She answered honestly and frankly, "Every time." After a pause, "Except the last few times when he began giving me facials." 

 "Did you like getting facials?" Carolyn asked, her hand again beginning its slow journey up her pet-to-be's leg. 

 "Not really," Mindy admitted, glancing down at Carolyn's hand, "it was sticky, gross and humiliating." After a pause, she added, "Yet, truthfully it made him happy so I allowed it." 

 "Did you enjoy swallowing?" Carolyn continued, seeing the stereotypical submissive before her... doing things she didn't enjoy to please others. 

 "It was okay," Mindy shrugged. "It's rather tasteless." 

 "Did he ever get you off?" Carolyn asked. 

 Mindy scoffed, "God, no. He fingered me and went down on me a couple times, but I also had to finish myself after I got home." 

 "That's a shame," Carolyn said, her hand now going under the dress. "Men are lost down there and will never ask for directions." 

 Mindy roared, "Isn't that the truth." 

 "Are you still a virgin?" Carolyn asked. 

 "No," Mindy sighed as she flashed back to the three minutes that deflowered her in an office for a gig she didn't get. 

 "I'm assuming it was anti-climactic?" Carolyn said. 

 "I have regretted it ever since," Mindy admitted. 

 "Only one man?" Carolyn asked. 

 Mindy didn't want to sound like a slut, but she had been with four men since moving to Los Angeles which was probably a lot. "No, ma'am." 

 "How many?" 

 "Four." 

 "Did you find fulfillment in your quest for love and acceptance through sex?" Carolyn asked, sounding more like a psychologist than a Mistress. 

 Mindy laughed, as, in retrospect that was exactly what she was doing. Trying to erase the past and find love. "No, each time only increased my own self- loathing." 

 Carolyn smiled at just how much Mindy was a poster child for her Maslow theory seduction. She was searching for self-worth, searching for a purpose, searching for a place she could discover her true self. Carolyn asked, "I'm assuming you have never been with a woman." 

 "Does today count?" Mindy joked, trying to both lighten the mood, but also hint that she was willing to explore a new side of her sexuality. She hadn't been curious about sex with another woman ever before, but today curiosity was tingling her kitty and the kitty wanted to come out and play. 

 "Not yet," Carolyn laughed, her hand giving a soft squeeze at the girl's thigh. 

 

 After a pause, Mindy wondered if this was the moment she did indeed change the answer to the question just asked. Carolyn asked, "Do you follow instructions well?" 

 "Yes, ma'am," she answered. 

 "Can you follow instructions without hesitation or questioning?" Carolyn continued. 

 "Yes, ma'am," Mindy nodded, curious as to the breadth of what she was agreeing to. 

 "Take off your dress," Carolyn ordered, an order that tested the truth to the last two answers. 

 Mindy was smart enough to understand the first order was a test of the last two agreements. She didn't question it, didn't delay her response, as she stood up and asked, "Can you unzip me?" 

 "Yes, I can, my dear," Carolyn smiled, as Mindy turned around. Carolyn stood up and slowly slid the zipper down her back... everything she did was calculated and paced. Eventually, Carolyn finished, but like a Mistress, didn't do the undressing, but instead allowed her pet to consciously finish the order given. 

 Mindy turned back around and nervously, not because she was getting naked in front of a relative stranger, but instead because she was insecure about her body, allowed her dress to drop to the floor. 

 "Your body is even more beautiful than I imagined, my dear," Carolyn complimented, building the young girl's self-esteem as the lengthy seduction continued. 

 "Thank you, ma'am," Mindy said. She had been told she was beautiful many times, had believed it many times, but this time she felt different... liberated. 

 "Now come take off my robe, my dear," Carolyn ordered. 

 "Yes, ma'am," Mindy nodded, wanting to see the woman's body. 

 Mindy moved to the sash, her hands trembling slightly. She undid the robe slowly. 

 Carolyn watched with satisfaction at the young woman's nervousness and yet also completely intoxicated facial expression. A look that could only happen that first time... like the first time you ate chocolate or a pussy. Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** Obedience: A Study in Seduction ****** bysilkstockingsloverÂ© Mindy opened the robe slowly, as if unwrapping a Christmas present. 

 Mindy stared at the voluptuous breasts that were held up firmly in a sexy black bra. 

 "Finish the task, my dear," Carolyn ordered, as she watched in amusement as the young girl stared at her large breasts. 

 "Y-y-yes, sorry, ma'am," Mindy stammered, embarrassed that she had been staring. She took the expensive silk robe off and carefully placed it on the couch. 

 Mindy obediently returned directly in front of Carolyn, looking forward to more questions, more orders. She couldn't explain it, but obeying gave her a natural high and an unexplainable desire to obey more. 

 "Are you willing to be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week?" Caroline asked, very happy with the eagerness of the young pet. 

 "Yes," Mindy nodded, as she stared at the deep valley of flesh... her mind in neutral and her body in lust. 

 "Are you willing to obey, without hesitation, any order you are given?" Carolyn asked, seeing the impact her body was having on the woman. The power of sensuality, mixed with the ability to seduce, was rare for a woman... Something Carolyn exuded. 

 This was a hard question, as it was so wide in scope. Yet Mindy, so taken by the powerful woman, nodded, "Yes." 

 "Take off your bra and panties, my dear," Carolyn ordered. 

 Mindy knew that again this order was a test of the last couple questions. Yet, she was already all in, as she answered, looking at the brunette's aqua blue eyes, "Yes, Mistress." 

 Mindy unclasped her bra and allowed her 34B, not too big, not too small, breasts to be freed. 

 "Very nice breasts, my dear," Carolyn complimented, keeping the positive reinforcements throughout the seduction. 

 "They are too small," Mindy said, always hating her breasts and wishing they were bigger. 

 Carolyn smiled, "They are the perfect size, my dear. Not too big, like these heavy jugs, and not too small. Really, they are the perfect size." Carolyn cupped them. 

 Mindy felt a gush of wetness leak out of her pussy on touch as bolts of electricity coursed through her body as she felt feelings she had never felt before. 

 Carolyn leaned forward and took Mindy's left nipple in her mouth and swirled her tongue around and over the diamond hard nipple. 

 "Oh," Mindy moaned, not used to enjoying her breasts being touched. Men handled them with recklessness, this was different. 

 Carolyn gave a brief bite to the nipple, before moving to the other protruding diamond and replicating the attention, believing symmetry and attention to detail were critical. 

 Mindy's head was spinning, her body was burning and her pussy was leaking. 

 Mindy had never known true intimacy until that moment. She realized then that she had never been made love to, she had only been fucked. 

 Carolyn gave just enough of a sampling of pleasure, before she moved back up and ordered, "Now your panties." 

 Mindy, wanting to let Carolyn know how horny she was, admitted, "I probably should, they are completely soaked." 

 "Why is that?" Caroline asked, testing the young woman. 

 Mindy didn't have an answer to the question. She couldn't explain her feelings. She didn't understand her feelings. She admitted, "I honestly don't know." 

 "I do," Carolyn smiled, seeing the confusion this question caused her. An answer that was sincere... She really had no clue. 

 "You do?" Mindy asked. 

 "You have always had this part of you inside. You just needed someone to awaken the sleeping sexuality," Carolyn explained, as she moved her hand to Mindy's pussy and slid it in. 

 Mindy was shocked and yet exhilarated as she moaned. Carolyn slowly fingered Mindy as she asked, "Have you ever tasted yourself?" Carolyn asked. 

 "Nooooo," Mindy answered, having never thought to do it, as the finger inside her drove her wild. 

 Carolyn pulled her finger out, again just enough of a tease to draw Mindy deeper into the abyss of submission. She moved her finger to Mindy's lips and said, "Time to change your answer to that question." 

 Mindy obediently opened her mouth and tasted her pussy juice off of Carolyn's finger. 

 "Good girl," Carolyn purred, as she watched the young girl slowly bob on her finger. 

 Mindy was surprised that her taste was tangy and sweet. She wondered instantly why her ex complained that her taste was gross. The next thing that popped into her head was 'I wonder what she would taste like?' 

 Carolyn moved, pulled her finger out, and ordered, choosing now as the time to use a new endearing, yet powerful term, "Take off my bra, my pet." 

 Mindy's eyes went big at the term 'pet'. A term that implied something a little more submissive versus dominant. Her pussy leaked again, this time slightly down her leg now that she wasn't wearing panties. She lifted her arms up and unclasped the woman's lace bra and released the voluptuous, still stunningly firm, breasts from their lace prison. 

 "Do you like?" Carolyn asked, the question rhetorical as the answer was obvious. 

 "Can I feel them?" Mindy asked, staring at the large breasts, almost double the size of own. 

 "I insist you do, my pet," Carolyn smiled. 

 Mindy took both breasts in both hands. "They are so heavy. How do you even walk straight with these?" 

 "They can be a burden," Carolyn nodded, before adding, "They are also super sensitive to the touch." 

 "I imagine so," Mindy nodded, staring at them like she was staring at the Mona Lisa. 

 "They are even more sensitive to the touch of a woman's lips, tongue and teeth," Carolyn added. 

 "May I kiss them?" Mindy asked, her mouth-watering as if conditioned to please. 

 

 "You may worship them all night, my pet," Carolyn offered. 

 Mindy leaned forward and kissed the left breast. She splattered the breasts with kisses before moving to the big erect nipple. 

 Carolyn moaned softly, "That's it, my pet. You will spend a lot of time between my tits and also between somewhere else if you decide to come work under me." 

 Mindy didn't want this to end. She still wasn't sure if she was going to take the job offer, much less move to New York. But this night, this moment in time, she was just going to let go of any doubt and obey without hesitation. 

 "Now the other one," Carolyn ordered, explaining, "It's very important that a pet spends equal time on each breast." 

 "You believe in symmetry too?" Mindy asked, as she moved to the other breast. 

 "You really are going to be a good full time pet," Carolyn smiled. 

 Mindy swirled her tongue around the nipple as she pondered if she would be able to resist the temptation to take the job offer. It was one thing to give into sexual submission for a night, but for a living... that was a whole different matter. That said, she pushed the thought out of her head, deciding to live in the now. 

 Carolyn noticed just the hint of doubt in the eyes of her pet and said, after a couple more minutes of having her breasts pleasured, which had her pussy wet, "Time to take off my panties. On your knees, Mindy." 

 The order was so strong that Mindy felt a rush of adrenaline. She reluctantly stopped playing with the tits in her hands, and lowered herself to her knees. On her knees, she couldn't help but feel she was at home. She reached up to Carolyn's hips and slowly pulled the sexy thong down her nylon-clad legs. As she did, she couldn't help but look at the older woman's vagina which was shaved completely. 

 Carolyn explained, "A Brazilian. Which I will set up for you as soon as you arrive in New York. A pussy is a lot more enjoyable to lick and please when it is hair free." 

 "Oh, okay," Mindy said, as Carolyn lifted up her feet so Mindy could finish removing the thong. Mindy felt bad that her pussy was quite hairy. She had never shaved it, although she had used scissors to trim the excess hair on occasion. 

 "Don't worry, my pet," Carolyn said. "You will regularly be pampered as well as doing the pampering." 

 Carolyn walked to the couch and sat down. She ordered, "Crawl to me, my pet." 

 "Yes, ma'am," Mindy nodded, the derogatory task actually turning her on. She crawled the few feet and was now at the feet of the older woman... naked except for the thigh high stockings. 

 "Do you want to taste your Mistress?" Carolyn asked, the last new term she would use today. The final straw in the complete seduction of the young lady was now at hand. 

 Mindy looked at the inviting, slightly glistening, pussy, the temptation to bury her face in it almost impossible. Mindy looked up at the beautiful, exotic, intriguing older woman as she pondered the final word... 'Mistress'. A word that embodied the older woman perfectly. A word that embodied the entire evening. Carolyn was the boss and she was the employee; Carolyn was the seductress and she was the prey; Carolyn was the Mistress and she was the pet, the submissive, the servant. 

 Carolyn watched the young lady ponder the question... ponder her fate. The final answer was never in doubt, just whether Caroline had to guide the pet further. She was confident the seduction was done, but every once and a while a final push was needed. That said, this time she was right. 

 Mindy finally answered, giving in unconditionally, "Yes, Mistress." 

 "This can be a one-time thing, my pet," Carolyn said, "or it can be the beginning of a new lifestyle, a new relationship, a new world." 

 Mindy had no idea for sure if she was willing to make it a new lifestyle, but the idea of a relationship was appealing. 

 "But tonight, you are mine body, mind and soul," Carolyn said. "Is that clear?" 

 

 "Yes, Mistress," Mindy nodded, not worrying at all about tomorrow, but focused on the night. 

 "Now go ahead, my pet, you are now where you were meant to be, doing what you were born to do, you are now home," Carolyn said, knowing that although she had told her pet this could be only a one night stand, the reality was no woman had ever been able to resist the draw of her aura and this young pet wasn't going to either... even if she didn't know it herself yet. 

 Mindy leaned in, even as her head processed the last words of her Mistress. She extended her tongue and tentatively licked. Fireworks sparked on her tongue. Chills coursed her being. Butterflies fluttered in her stomach. Her soul stirred with purpose. She was indeed home. 

 The facial expression on her pet's face the moment she tasted her was all the confirmation Carolyn needed to know that the pet was unconditionally, undeniably hers. 

 Mindy slowly explored the entire pussy, leaving no crevice ignored. 

 Carolyn was impressed by the first timer's tender eagerness. She moaned, "Good girl, you're a natural down there." 

 "You taste so good," Mindy admitted, unable to get enough of the intoxicating, addicting taste. 

 Carolyn gently reached down to Mindy's chin and lifted her up to look into her eyes. "Mindy, this is your home. On your knees, between my legs is your home. It is your purpose in life to be on your knees serving." 

 As Mindy listened to the words that should have been ludicrous, she knew it was true. She had never felt this free, this important. She felt that Carolyn needed her, understood her and would love her. And although she hadn't been sure she was willing to give her life to a woman she had met only a couple of hours ago, unsure she was willing to sacrifice her dream of Hollywood stardom, unsure she was willing to move to New York and start a new life... she now knew she was. 

 Mindy nodded, "Mistress, I understand, and if the job offer is still available I'll take it." 

 "That makes me very happy," Carolyn smiled, as she moved her hand away and said, "Now get me off with that eager tongue of yours." 

 Mindy, now wanting to get her new Mistress off, shifted to longer strokes, as if she was painting the pussy. 

 Carolyn moaned, "That's it, my pet." 

 Mindy, encouraged by her Mistress's words, kept licking and as the moans increased she moved her tongue to her clit. 

 "Oh, yes, you eager little pet," Carolyn moaned, her orgasm increasing. She reached and grabbed the back of Mindy's head and began slowly grinding her ass up and down. 

 Mindy loved the feeling of being a vessel of pleasure for her Mistress and eagerly kept licking. 

 Carolyn, near orgasm, asked, "Do you want to taste your new owner's cum?" 

 The word 'owner' was a little more extreme for Mindy, but she answered like a good submissive, "Yes, Mistress." 

 After another minute, Carolyn declared, just as she was about to come, "I'm going to come on your pretty face, Mindy." 

 It was the first time she heard her name in a while. Hearing her name again made this real, and yet she was completely okay with it. She accepted her position and was rewarded with the ultimate gift a Mistress can give a pet... her cum. 

 Mindy eagerly licked up the wine of love as it streamed out of Carolyn and flowed into her mouth. Mindy couldn't believe the heavenly taste and knew without a doubt, she was a lesbian. She had never enjoyed cock or cum, she just did it to please her man. But this... this she enjoyed and knew she would crave. 

 Letting go of Mindy's head, Carolyn purred, "That was very good, my pet." 

 Mindy looked up and giggled, "I couldn't agree more." 

 Carolyn smiled, "Come up here." 

 Mindy did and soon they were kissing. It was tender and intimate... again so different from kissing a man. 

 When Carolyn broke the kiss, she ordered, "Now on all fours on the couch." 

 "Okay," Mindy nodded, as she obeyed, praying that her Mistress was going to return the favour. 

 Carolyn knew from experience that most Mistresses never licked the pussy of their pets. They may fuck them with strap-ons, but never did they allow themselves to be in the position of the submissive. There was a hierarchy and a clear Mistress and submissive relationship. 

 Carolyn, though, didn't believe in this theory. In her mind, the Mistress and the submissive were equals, but each had their role. 

 Carolyn didn't eat pussy often. It was a rarity and a gift to a pet that had earned it. Yet, she always did the first time. The first time was always intimate and almost as equals... Future encounters could include strap-on cocks, threesomes, fisting's and anal sex. That said, there were different trainings, different extremes pushed for each pet's needs. 

 Carolyn had learned that each pet is different with different desires, needs and limits. Some wanted to be pushed to the extremes of sexuality, to be literally owned in essence, some just wanted the motherly figure who guided her through a sexual journey of self-discovery. 

 Carolyn had a hunch that Mindy here would land in between those two spectrums over time. That said, her training would be slow and planned. She moved her hands to Mindy's ass and purred softly, "Such a nice ass." 

 "Thank you, Mistress," Mindy replied, enjoying the hands on her ass and anticipating the long awaited orgasm. 

 Carolyn asked, as her right hand went to Mindy's wet pussy, "Do you want me to taste you?" 

 "Yessss," Mindy trembled on touch. 

 "Yes, what?" Carolyn asked, the training of a full time pet under way. 

 "Yes, Mistress," Mindy immediately corrected, learning her role very quickly. Her body was burning and dying for sexual release. 

 "So wet," Carolyn said, continuing to tease the young pet. "Why are you so wet, my pet?" 

 "I don't know," Mindy answered, which was true. She couldn't explain why her mind and body had given themselves to this stranger with such ease and also felt so natural. 

 "Think about it," Carolyn instructed, as she continued the slow tease. Through experience the Mistress knew that the best pets learned early to accept who they are. This was a necessary first step to a true submission, without which the pet could never really get truly comfortable or truly commit to their role. This was best achieved through a self-declaration, a final understanding by the pet-to-be herself. She added, gently guiding her to the correct discovery, the answer is right there inside you." 

 Mindy heard the question and instantly she knew the answer. Yet admitting something so foundational to her core self-worth was difficult to admit. 

 The reality was Mindy had always been trying to impress others her whole life, always denying her own needs... the first time she broke free of this desire to please was when she came to Los Angeles, but the reality that she had been refusing to accept now was clear... she didn't belong here. She hadn't been successful as an actress, but she had convinced herself she was doing okay. Tricking herself into thinking she could make it in this ruthless west coast dog eat dog world. 

 It was obvious to Mindy she wasn't cut out for this life and Carolyn had allowed her months of denial to suddenly be accepted. 

 That said, Carolyn had also rekindled a side of her that she had squelched completely... the need to please. 

 The reality was that Mindy suddenly realized with the crystal clarity of a 4k diamond why she was so wet. Why her body was burning with desire. Why her mind was allowing her to give in to the pleasure, give in to the pure unbridled lust that was suddenly consuming her. She was home. She had found, without a doubt, her purpose in life... 

 Carolyn could see the young girl's eyes as revelation crystallized. 

 Mindy answered, the declaration cementing her role in this new undefinable relationship, "Mistress, the simple answer, which has a way more complex answer, is I'm home." 

 Carolyn smiled. In all her years of seduction, those were the most powerful words a pet had said. She replied, "That you are, my girl. That you are." 

 And with that, Carolyn did what she only rarely did, she licked a pet's pussy. 

 "Oh, yes," Mindy moaned, the moment she felt the tongue on her pussy. 

 "You taste like warm honey, my little girl," Carolyn purred, deciding to play a motherly figure to this lost soul who had just discovered her true purpose and place in this complicated world. 

 Hearing herself called little girl brought new emotions to Mindy, only enhancing her feelings of being home. 

 Nothing had ever felt completely right in Mindy's life. She had always felt slightly off, slightly out of the loop... yet, tonight the stars had all lined up and spoke to her. And now, without a doubt, she knew who she was, what she was. 

 The orgasm built rather quickly. Which wasn't a surprise based on the wild night. In only a couple of minutes, which frustrated Mindy, who wanted this intimate perfection to last forever; her orgasm was about to erupt. 

 Mindy's breathing got erratic and she whimpered, "Oh God, I'm going to explode, Mistress." 

 Usually, a pet was only allowed to come when given permission. But on this first special night, Carolyn, being the caring and compassionate Mistress she was, was going to break her own rule. She purred, as she took the young pet's clit into her mouth, "Let your honey flow, my pet. I want to taste the full flood of your honey." 

 "Okay," Mindy moaned loudly, as her whole body flinched wildly when her clit was touched. 

 And then it came. Mindy realized then as her body transcended to an entirely different world, that she had never really had an orgasm, as unbeknown pleasure suddenly hit her with the power of an asteroid hitting earth. 

 Mindy screamed, loud enough to wake the entire hotel, "Holy fuck!" 

 Carolyn lapped the sweet flood of cum, always enjoying tasting a new pet. 

 Mindy's entire body felt pleasure she didn't know existed and couldn't believe she had lived without all these years. 

 Carolyn allowed her pet to enjoy the orgasm before getting up and going to her suitcase for what she never left home without... her strap-on cock. (Now that would be a great American Express commercial) 

 Mindy felt her Mistress leave and yet she didn't move at all. The orgasm seemed to just keep going and going, and she refused to move until it ended. Report_Story #4 

 

 ****** Obedience: A Study in Seduction ****** bysilkstockingsloverÂ© Carolyn returned, harness on, and moved to her still coming pet. Without warning, she slid the entire seven inch cock (not too big, not too small), deep in the pet's very wet pussy. 

 "Oh my," Mindy gasped, completely not expecting her pussy to be filled with a cock. A cock bigger than any she had ever fucked. 

 "Time to get fucked, my pet," Carolyn said, as she went for the final kill of her seduction. She was already pretty confident that Mindy was hers, but showing her dominance and giving her pet multiple orgasms was her signature first night seduction. 

 "Oh God, yes, fuck me, Mistress," Mindy begged, as she learned that the fucking seemed to rekindle the pleasure that was fading away. 

 "Ever have multiple orgasms?" Carolyn asked, as she fucked her pet hard and deep. 

 "I don't think I ever had a real one before tonight, Mistress," Mindy admitted, still overwhelmed with pleasure. 

 Carolyn smiled. It wasn't the first time she had heard that. Many women didn't get off with men and many woman's self-exploring orgasms tended to be tremors not earthquakes. 

 "Let's see if we can fuck you to orgasm, my little girl," she said, repeating the motherly persona. 

 Mindy somehow got more turned on by the 'little girl' label. She liked the idea of being guided, being taught, of having the motherly figure which she never had, being raised by just her father. 

 She begged, her body again giving in completely to the pleasure, "Oh yes, Mommy, fuck your baby girl." 

 Carolyn smiled. Carolyn had no children, but saw Mindy instantly as the daughter she never had... albeit a daughter she planned to train to be a full time sexual submissive nonetheless. She kept the role playing going as she kept fucking her pet, loving the feeling of their bodies slamming into each other. "Mommy's going to make her baby girl very happy." 

 And for a few minutes there was just the sound of bodies slamming into each other and a young girl's increasingly loud moans. 

 "Oh Mommy, I'm coming again," Mindy declared. The cycle of pleasure spinning like a hamster wheel. 

 Mindy collapsed forward, the cock slipping out of her, her body shaking like a ten on the Richter scale. 

 Carolyn watched as her pet came again, as she took the harness off before moving to her pet and kissing her tenderly. 

 After a few minutes of sweet tenderness, Carolyn said, "Come on, baby girl, come join me in bed." 

 "Okay," Mindy nodded, the double orgasms finally seemingly done their journey. Yet, she felt so weak and tired, she wasn't sure she would be able to walk. 

 Carolyn saw the utter exhaustion of her newest pet and helped her up. She took Mindy's hand and led her to the bedroom. All of Maslow's hierarchy needs had been met for this lost girl and now she had been found. 

 Mindy followed, feeling a tranquility she couldn't ever recall feeling before. She was home. 

 SAMANTHA SUMMERS 

 Around the same time, a younger Mistress was on a plane to Paris to meet with one 

 of the top designers. 

 The younger Mistress was the polar opposite of Carolyn, a woman she had never met and didn't know at all... yet. 

 The younger Mistress used her beauty, money and aggression to get what she wanted. 

 Samantha was a ravenous redhead beauty, with exotic green eyes that seemed to hypnotize. She was also partly Irish which could be seen by her quick temper and 'it's my way or the highway' attitude. 

 Born into money, she was used to getting what she wanted and didn't take no for an answer. 

 She was ruthless and used a variety of manipulations to get what she wanted. Threats, blackmail and bribery were common when she didn't automatically get what she wanted. 

 She was also a complete lesbian. 

 She had no use for men and if she ever decided to have children, she would adopt. No way was she going to ruin her perfect body. 

 She was flying to the Paris store because she was told the dress she wanted, which she saw Pam Thomas, the new 'it' woman, wear at the Oscars was a one of a kind and she wanted something similar. 

 In first class, the only way she flew, she was being her usual demanding self as she decided she was going to have the flight attendant sexually please her. 

 Samantha enjoyed airplane sex and especially loved turning straight woman, especially older straight woman and even more so, married older straight woman. 

 

 At twenty-three she had been turning women for years... the first being her mother's best friend. 

 Since then, Samantha had seduced a woman every few days (give or take), minus those pesky few days every cycle, and had a collection of pets in dozens of cities. She also had a travelling assistant who was available for more than just the typical business duties. She rotated these women usually every few months. Her most recent assistant was a cop who pulled her over for going 90 miles per hour on the interstate, but ended up eating her pussy in the back of her police car. 

 Samantha always got what she wanted and at the moment what she wanted was to have the pretty stewardess, likely in her early thirties, munching her cunt. 

 Her assistant was in coach, a punishment for not answering her phone properly, so she had the front row to herself. 

 Once the plane was in the air, and the first drinks were served, Samantha slipped out of her five inch heels and moved her feet to rest on top of the arm rest in the aisle. 

 When the stewardess, wedding ring on hand, walked by, Samantha said, "I need a foot massage." 

 The stewardess, who had seen many things in her twelve years, especially the last two in first class, was only slightly surprised. She said, "Sorry, ma'am that is not one of the services we offer." 

 "Oh, that needs to change," Samantha said, as she looked at the name tag. "Christine." 

 Christine had been hit on many times on the plane, mostly by rich men, mostly married, but even a few women over the years. It seemed that the airplane was a pickup spot for the rich and horny. 

 Christine had rejected all the advances, including offers of money, jewelry and drugs. 

 As she looked at the woman, she couldn't deny that the passenger was incredibly beautiful, like she just stepped out of a magazine and exuded an aura that dripped power. 

 Christine responded, ignoring the woman's last words, "Is there anything else I can do for you, ma'am?" 

 "I already told you what I wanted," Samantha repeated, her gentle tone of the first request replaced by a terse one. 

 Christine sighed to herself. It was going to be a long flight. Hopefully, she would fall asleep. She repeated, "I'm sorry, ma'am, it is not something I am comfortable doing." 

 "I don't recall asking if you were comfortable doing it," Samantha sighed back. "And I don't appreciate the dramatic sigh. I am a paying customer in first class and I expect to be treated as such. Now massage my feet." 

 Christine glanced at the mostly empty small area for the rich and pretentious. Only three other passengers were in it. One was already asleep; one had her headphones on and was on her iPad doing whatever; the last one was watching with a 'What a bitch' look. 

 "Hurry up," Samantha demanded. "My feet are aching." 

 Christine thought to herself. 'Then don't wear five inch heels'. She answered, "Please, ma'am, what you're requesting is very unorthodox." 

 Samantha replied, "I like to think outside the box." 

 That barely made any sense to Christine, who finally figured the quicker she did this the quicker it would be over. 

 "Only for a minute," Christine finally said, as she bent down and massaged the young woman's foot, shame burning through her. 

 "Kneel down and use both hands," Samantha ordered, already looking forward to her mile high orgasm on the oblivious stewardess's face. She didn't know that once you submitted at all, the rest was inevitable. 

 Christine reluctantly obeyed, getting on her pantyhose clad knees and using both hands to give a deep foot massage... like she enjoyed receiving from her husband. 

 "That's better," Samantha nodded, as she began to read a magazine. 

 'She's reading a fucking magazine!' Christine thought to herself as she massaged the woman's ridiculously soft feet. How could she possibly get her feet that soft? 

 After a minute, Samantha ordered, moving the other foot to the woman while also allowing her dress to ride up enough to showcase her natural red bush to the pet-to-be. 

 Samantha didn't believe in shaving her pussy. She had it trimmed by her assistant every couple days, but the natural red patch was an alluring aspect of her sensuality. Plus, she had learned that it captured her exotic, unique pussy scent that seemed to be its own aphrodisiac. She learned at a young age, having half a dozen fellow classmates literally begging to lick her, that her pussy was somehow blessed. It apparently tasted different than other pussies; it smelt different than other pussies. It was the Mona Lisa, the David, the Catcher in the Rye of pussies... And usually one lick, one scent, and the women, straight, bi or gay always came crawling back for more. 

 Christine gasped as she got a glimpse of the young lady's red beaver. Who goes on a plane without underwear? At least wear hosiery if you are going to go commando. 

 Samantha saw Christine notice and explained, "I'm not a big fan of underwear." 

 "So I see," Christine said, as she subserviently took the other foot offered to her in her hand. 

 "Plus," Samantha added, foreshadowing her future plans rather bluntly, "it makes for easier access." 

 Christine didn't say anything, just focused on the task at hand, even as she couldn't completely get the red trimmed pussy out of her head. 

 After a couple of minutes, Samantha said, "That's good." 

 Christine stood up, even more annoyed there was no thank you. She shook her head and walked away. 

 Half an hour later, Christine did her next round. She started at the back, wanting to avoid the pretentious passenger as long as she could. 

 When the stewardess returned, looking nervous, Samantha noticed a run in the woman's pantyhose. 

 Samantha loathed pantyhose. They were a male invention to make women's life more inconvenient. She tanned regularly and couldn't fathom why she would disguise her perfect tan with fake uncomfortable colours. She liked to wear lingerie with vintage stockings on rare occasion, but generally she never wore them. 

 "I see you got a run in your pantyhose," Samantha said. "You should probably just take them off." 

 "Standard issue," Christine shrugged, as she noticed the run. She sighed, that was the second run this week. She admitted, "I'd rather not wear them." 

 "I understand," Samantha nodded. "They are uncomfortable, cumbersome and prevent access to the good stuff." 

 Christine thought maybe the young redhead was hitting on her earlier, but had concluded that she was likely just a diva doing diva things. A spoiled daughter to some rich dad that parented through money. Actually, Christine felt sorry for girls like that...'who didn't know what love really was and will likely continue the cycle of loveless family life when she had kids she didn't really look after or raise'. Yet, she laughed softly, as she decided to make it clear she didn't swing that way, although she did it with sexual innuendo, "The good stuff down there that I like, you don't have." 

 "Have you tasted from the other side?" Samantha asked. She had heard many women tell her they were straight only to have them begging to lick her moments later and always come back for more. 

 "Maybe," the stewardess shrugged. The truth was that she had, while drunk at a wild sorority night of truth and dare. She actually enjoyed it, but it was a one night thing and not something she had thought much about since she was married. On rare occasion, when hit on at work by a beautiful woman she would reminisce about that one time, but nothing more. 

 Seduction was a poker game, and Samantha could read faces and body language well. She responded, "I'm guessing once in high school." 

 "College, actually," Christine responded, before realizing she had said it. 

 "Well, I promise you that if you sampled my delicacy you would be forever changed," Samantha countered, a promise she could back with a hundred percent guarantee. 

 "I'll have to take your word on it," Christine said, knowing she had allowed this conversation to get way too personal. "Can I get you anything?" 

 Samantha nodded, "A glass of wine." 

 "Red or white?" Christine asked. 

 "Well, red of course," Samantha answered, her tone dripping with sexual innuendo, "Nothing tastes better than red wine." 

 Christine caught the innuendo and quipped, "I'm more of a rum or vodka drinker." 

 Samantha didn't respond, allowing the stewardess to think she won. 

 As soon as the stewardess left to get her drink, Samantha moved her fingers to her pussy and began slowly fingering herself. She didn't pull her slightly wet fingers out until Christine returned with the glass of wine. 

 Christine gasped as she witnessed the pretty young redhead masturbate. She had heard people masturbating many times; she saw hands under blankets many times; saw women giving head a few times; she saw guys fingering their women on occasion, and even a few couples having sex (although that was usually in the bathroom), but never someone blatantly doing it for her to see. And she was pretty confident she was meant to see it. 

 As the stewardess arrived and placed the wine down, Samantha kept fingering herself. She asked, "Want your tip?" 

 "We don't take tips," the suddenly rattled woman replied, somehow unable to take her eyes off the finger moving in and out of the red bush. 

 "Oh, I insist," Samantha smiled, as she pulled her fingers out of her wet pussy and moved her fingers up in the air. "Clean my fingers." 

 "Ma'am," Christine gasped, this aggressive behaviour shocking. 

 "Now!" Samantha ordered, standing up and shoving her two fingers in the stunned stewardess's open mouth. 

 Christine was paralyzed by shock as she found herself with pussy juice coated fingers in her mouth as she was finger-face fucked (was that even a real thing?) by the passenger. 

 "Enjoy the appetizer?" Samantha asked, as she pulled her fingers out, hinting at what she still had in mind for later. 

 Christine was stunned. The scent was oddly intoxicating and the taste was undeniably exotic and sweet. These feelings were conflicted with the anger that she had just been violated. 

 Confused and angry, Christine didn't answer, instead walking away. Samantha called out, "The taste is a lot better directly from the source." 

 Christine leaned against the wall. What was going on? Why was her pussy super wet? Why did she allow that to happen? Why did she just lick her lips to retrieve any last remnants of that unique taste? How was she going to avoid her for three more hours? 

 Samantha, meanwhile, kept her dress hiked up, her legs parted enough to give a glorious view of her honey box, as she texted Chloe: 

 Come see me slut! 

 Instantly Chloe responded: 

 Yes, Mistress. 

 Christine calmed down as she scolded herself for her behaviour. She was checking her phone messages when she saw the light flicker; the light that implied someone was coming from coach and into first class. This was usually a fellow stewardess, but on occasion some drunk or celebrity hunter. 

 She put her phone away and saw a blonde move beside the redhead. She sighed, 'What could this be about?' 

 Samantha ordered, "Slow licking, slut. This is just a sampling for you." 

 "Yes, Mistress," Chloe nodded, as she eagerly buried her face in her Mistress's pussy. She was a long way from the no nonsense police officer she had been six months ago. Back then she was engaged and talking about having children, even imagining being captain of a district one day. Now she was a personal servant to the bitchiest woman in the universe and yet she was always in constant need to have her approval. It was a complete contradiction to who she thought she was as a person... she now constantly craved her Mistress's pussy, a taste that was second to none. 

 Samantha parted her legs even wider and allowed her pet to please her, looking forward to the stewardess's reaction. She resumed reading as she heard the clicking of heels coming towards her. 

 Christine saw the heels on the floor first and instantly knew what was happening. Yet, she continued to go see for sure partly out of curiosity and partly out of her duty. Then she saw it; a blonde between the legs of the redhead. And she was definitely licking the redhead's pussy. 

 Samantha moaned, not looking up from her book, "Nice and slow, my slut." 

 "Yes, Mistress," Chloe replied between licks, even as she knew she was being watched. Originally, serving her Mistress in public was humiliating and stressful. Yet now, she didn't question it, instead she took every opportunity given to taste from perfection. She no longer knew humiliation, only serving. 

 Christine should have demanded they stop. Instead she watched with mixed feelings. She couldn't believe the gall of the passenger to do such a thing... to have no shame. Yet, she was impressed by her confidence and brazen personality... not caring what others thought. However, her job was to escort the coach passenger back to her seat. 

 Samantha glanced up and saw the confused face of her next prey. She had seen this look many times: the look of conflicting emotions. Sometimes Samantha would allow this to go on for a while, other times she cut right to the chase. This was a cut to the chase time. 

 She introduced her pet to her pet-to-be. "Christine, this is one of my sex slaves, Chloe." 

 Chloe looked up, her lips already wet with pussy perfection, and greeted as if she wasn't eating pussy in public, "Hi, Christine." 

 Christine was flabbergasted. Shocked by the casualness of both women. Shocked by the term 'sex slave'. Shocked at how beautiful the blonde was. She stammered, "Um, hi." 

 Chloe asked, knowing that is what her kinky Mistress would want, "Would you like to eat Mistress's pussy?" 

 Christine gasped, shock compounding shock as she heard the blunt question. The answer was obviously no, yet she couldn't help but look at the red hair and wet pussy of the sexy passenger. 

 Samantha said, "Chloe, tell Christine what you did for a living before becoming my personal pussy pleasing sex slave." 

 Chloe, used to sharing this, her Mistress enjoying showing her power, answered, "I was a police officer." 

 Christine was stunned. First, she had never seen a female police officer that was so hot, other than on cop television shows. Second, she couldn't fathom how a police officer would end up quitting her job to do this. 

 "Go back to your seat, slut," Samantha ordered. 

 "Yes, Mistress," Chloe stood up, and deciding to assist her Mistress in the seduction, kissed the pretty stewardess. 

 Christine didn't respond; she was unable to believe this beautiful woman was kissing her. Yet, her body responding faster than her mind, her mouth opened and allowed the sex slave's tongue to explore her mouth. Fire burning inside her loins; the intimacy of the kiss powerful. She began kissing back; the two tongues soon dancing together. 

 Samantha smiled both at her pet's aggressiveness and her pet-to-be's response. 

 Breaking the kiss, Chloe said, "You're so cute, ma'am." She then headed back to her seat with confidence, knowing she would be back in her Mistress's good graces. 

 Christine stood there paralyzed, her head spinning with her body's betrayal. She could also taste the passenger's pussy juice on her lips and in her mouth... a taste that she wanted to have more of. 

 "Come finish what Chloe started," Samantha ordered, her legs still spread open. 

 Report_Story #5 

 

 ****** Obedience: A Study in Seduction ****** bysilkstockingsloverÂ© Christine remained paralyzed, now by indecision. Her mind was screaming no, but her body, heated up from what she had witnessed and the kiss she just had, was screaming yes just as loud. 

 "Everyone is asleep, my pet," Samantha pointed out, using the submissive term for the first time. "No one will ever know." 

 Christine glanced at her customers who were indeed all asleep. 

 "Now, Christine," Samantha ordered, seeing the indecision in the woman's eyes, sensing the inner battle she was fighting between moral responsibility and immoral lust. 

 Christine stared at the inviting red bush. The pussy was glistening like a Christmas star of Bethlehem guiding the way. 

 Getting impatient, Samantha, not believing patience was a virtue, threatened, "Look, either get on your knees and get licking or I'll get Chloe back in here. This is a very limited time offer." 

 Christine knew she should walk away; she knew she should resist the growing temptation, but the allure of the pussy before her; the aura of the woman before her and the slight samples that had teased her taste buds said otherwise. Before she knew it, she lowered herself to her knees between the redhead's legs. 

 Samantha smiled, a rush of adrenaline coursing through her like it always did after a successful seduction. She watched the pretty older woman stare at her pussy, just inches away, one last moment of denial before the natural desire to obey took over. 

 Christine stared at the pussy. She wanted to lick it, to taste it, yet suddenly Jake, her husband, popped into her head. This is cheating. Yet, Jake, like every guy in the universe, would likely love to watch his wife with another woman. 

 Samantha sometimes allowed the pet to take her time before submitting, but she was horny; Chloe had gotten her revved up with her wicked tongue, and she wanted to get off. So she reached down, grabbed the stewardess's head and pulled it into her wetness. "Get licking, slut," she ordered, as she held the head firmly pressed against her pussy. 

 Christine was again surprised, yet overwhelmed by the strong, intoxicating scent that enveloped her. It was like being in a rose garden. She didn't even think about what she should do, she just did what came natural. She licked. And if the samples she tasted on the passenger's fingers, or the ex-cop's lips were an intriguing appetizer, well the entre was heaven on earth. She could feel fireworks on her taste buds as she parted the wet pussy lips. 

 Samantha held the woman in place, enjoying the tentative first licks. Knowing that the woman was having a transcending moment of clarity that would forever change who she was as a person. She knew her pussy did that. It wasn't a smug confidence, well, okay, it was, but it was also the truth, Her pussy was a magic wand, it transformed straight women into bisexual women or lesbian women. It also turned strong-willed feminists into eager submissive sex slaves who would do anything, sacrifice anything to taste from the Holy Grail of pussy again. 

 Samantha flashed back to some of her other conquests: 

 -Her principal, who was going to suspend her for having drugs in her locker and who ended up getting fisted on her desk and who at graduation gave her speech with a butt plug in her ass and a vibrating egg in her pussy (that Samantha turned on and off at will for her own personal entertainment). 

 -A church minister's wife she met at a baptism for a niece and ended up having serve her in the sanctuary, even as the wife begged the Lord for forgiveness when Samantha fucked her with a candle. 

 -A very famous ex-Disney pop star who ate her out before the encore, while fans waited impatiently for almost ten minutes. 

 -A governor who would regularly fly across the country or globe for a half hour fix of Samantha's pussy after first tasting it during an election campaign in a bathroom while security kept them alone. She then gave a speech with her face literally glistening with cum. 

 -Her mother, Samantha just walked in on her one morning a few days after her eighteenth birthday and straddled her face and ground on her stunned mother until she came. 

 Christine couldn't believe how amazing the pussy tasted. She wondered if all pussy tasted like this. She couldn't recall at all what the pussy she licked back in college tasted like other than pleasant. This was a lot more than pleasant. It was as if strawberries and blueberries merged and formed a new fruit. 

 Samantha, confident based on the eagerness of the stewardess's tongue, let go of her head and watched the new pussy pleaser lick. 

 Samantha pulled out her phone and began quietly filming, almost always having a video for every seduction which came in handy mostly for blackmail threats to keep things a secret, but also for posterity. 

 Christine was happy to be able to breathe better, the confined space a little intense, but she didn't stop licking. She was no longer being forced, she was continuing to lick of her own accord. 

 "You like my cunt, slut?" Samantha asked, always liking to make the chick licking her for the first time say it. 

 "Yes," Christine whispered, without stopping licking. 

 "Tell me how much," Samantha ordered. 

 "A lot," Christine answered, hating the humiliation the woman was adding to the already humiliating task. 'Why can't she just shut up and enjoy it?' 

 "Look at me," Samantha said. 

 Christine reluctantly did and saw she was being filmed. She begged, her eyes going big, "Please shut that off. I could lose my job." 

 "Be a good, obedient pussy munching slut and this video is just for me and my collection," Samantha said, only having to use such blackmail video on a couple of occasions in her life. Her pussy allure usually was enough to control her pets past and present. 

 "Please, I..." Christine begged, terrified of the consequences of her actions. 

 "Tell me what you want?" Samantha ordered, cutting her off and ignoring, as she usually did, the concerns of the pet. 

 "I need to get back to work," Christine said, beginning to stand. 

 Samantha pushed her back to the floor as she agreed, "Yes, you do. But answer the question first. Then you can finish your job as rug muncher and I won't have to send this video of you to a MILF website." 

 Defeated and fearing for her career and marriage if this video got out, Christine said, "I want to taste your cum." 

 "Take five licks," Samantha said. "I want to refocus you on what you really want." 

 Christine obeyed, the heavenly taste again, sending sparks through her being and beginning to forget the inherent risk of public humiliation that could follow. 

 "Now, beg for more," Samantha demanded. This was the moment she liked the most. When a woman begged to give her an orgasm. Even more when just minutes earlier the woman was adamant that she had no interest in licking pussy. 

 Christine stared at the pussy, licked her lips without thinking, and then looked up at the camera. She knew instantly the risk was worth the reward. She answered, looking into the camera, accepting her hunger to lick, acknowledging she was a temporary sex slave, "Please let your new sex slave lick your beautiful pussy. Come all over my lips and face and baptise me your slut." 

 Samantha smiled, liking the declaration. She had heard many over the years, but few quite like what she had just heard. 

 Samantha often made the new pussy pleaser beg two or three or more times, but happy with the answer and horny as hell, she said, "Go ahead slut, become the cunt lapper you were born to be." 

 Christine thought the words ludicrous, she wasn't born to lick pussy, yet as she leaned forward and resumed licking, it did indeed feel natural. 

 Samantha closed her eyes and enjoyed the woman's eager tongue. 

 Christine licked and probed with her tongue, as if searching in every nook and cranny for treats like a child on Easter morning. On occasion new bursts of flavour would hit her taste buds and create waves of pleasure through her own erogenous zones. She couldn't explain it, but her nipples were hard and her pussy was leaking. 

 Samantha was impressed with the woman's eagerness and almost archeologist-like approach to muff munching. Soon her orgasm was building and she moaned, "Don't stop, slut, the promised land is just a few licks away." 

 Christine heard the heavy breathing and then the woman's strange words and prepared for the pussy covenant. 

 "Yes, you slut, suck my clit," Samantha demanded. 

 Christine did and after a few more seconds she was rewarded for her hard work when the full flood of the Champaign of the Gods poured into her mouth. She kept licking, like a man who finds water after days in the desert. She kept licking, not wanting this moment of purity of sexual submission to end. She kept licking, wanting to savour the taste. 

 Samantha allowed her orgasm to course through her for a few minutes... her orgasms always intense and long. 

 Finally, Samantha said, amazed that the woman kept licking long after the cum had been earned, "If you want to be my slut again, you will text the number on the card I am about to give you within the next twenty-four hours thanking me for the privilege of serving me. The better the thank you, the more likely I will allow you to serve me again. If it is after twenty-four hours don't bother." 

 Christine was disappointed it was over. Yet, as Samantha talked, she quickly remembered where she was and what she was really supposed to be doing and stood up. 

 Samantha handed her her business card, pulled her skirt down and said, "Now that is what I call first class service." 

 "Thank you, ma'am," Christine said, unsure what else to say as she took the card. 

 "You're welcome, pussy muncher," Samantha said, as she returned to reading. 

 Humiliation again hit the stewardess at the name calling and the trivialness of the behaviour. She washed her face, after looking at herself in the mirror and seeing her make-up a mess. She then cursed herself for her weakness. She had willingly licked a passenger while on duty. Fuck! There was no way she was texting this woman. She wasn't going to do it again. She tossed the card in the garbage and returned to work. 

 Samantha drifted to sleep knowing the text would come. Not right away, but within the time allotted. At the moment the stewardess was questioning why she had done what she did. She was scolding herself for being weak. She felt guilty for what she'd done. Yet, in the end, she would make the text because even after all the reasons not to, she wouldn't be able to resist the possibility of tasting perfection again. 

 When the plane landed, Samantha said as she got off, "Thanks for the very personal care." 

 "You're welcome," Christine nodded, cheeks instantly burning red. 

 Once all the passengers were off the plane and Christine was doing her last tasks she began to think about the redhead passenger again... and her pussy. Next thing she knew, she was going through the bathroom garbage and pulling out the card. 

 Once back in her hotel room, she collapsed on the bed and fingered herself to an orgasm as she recalled her submission to a stranger. 

 Next day, as she prepared for the return flight to New York she looked at the card on the table. 

 Samantha was on her way to the lingerie shop when the text came. She smiled as she saw how she was addressed. 

 Mistress 

 Thank you so much for seeing a side of me that even I didn't know existed. 

 Thank you for allowing me the privilege to taste your sweet pussy and swallow your addicting cum. 

 Thank you for releasing the inner cunt munching, pussy pleasing, cum lapping lesbian side which I never took seriously. 

 Thank you for making me your sex slave. 

 Love, your eager slut Christine Panteen 

 Your wish is my command! 

 As Christine arrived at the airport, she checked her phone. No response. She wanted a response. 

 Samantha knew she would pay her a visit when she returned to New York. Having a woman with airline connections could have great dividends. 

 Of course, Samantha didn't immediately reply. She would wait for days or weeks before responding. She long ago learned that psychological manipulation only enhanced the complete servitude of a new slave. 

 Reaching the lingerie shop, Samantha entered with Chloe behind her and asked to see Scarlett LeBouf. 

 Scarlett, a short, large breasted brunette dressed in her own designer apparel, walked out a couple minutes later. She had researched Samantha Summers, like she did all her private appointments, and learned that she had a reputation for being difficult. She had even called a couple acquaintances and was warned she was not only difficult, but a sexual predator. 

 This didn't faze Scarlett, who was a lesbian and often enjoyed sex with the rich and famous. The world would be shocked at how many of the celebrities they admired were bisexual or complete lesbians. Eating pussy was about as common as drinking champagne while shopping. At her elite shop, behind the main store, was a back room for the women who could pay for it. And it was obvious, Samantha could pay for it. 

 "Good afternoon, ma'am," Scarlett greeted, offering her hand. 

 Samantha didn't greet back, instead saying, "I want the dress that you designed for Pam Thomas." 

 "As I stated to your assistant on the phone that isn't possible. It is a one of a kind design that has already been purchased by another client," Scarlett said, knowing that her one Mistress, out of all her lovers, Carolyn, already had it. 

 "Then get it back," Samantha said. 

 "That's not how it works," Scarlett explained. 

 "It does now," Samantha said, before adding, "Money is not an object." 

 "It usually isn't," Scarlett countered back, used to having rich, spoiled younger women trying to buy whatever they wanted. 

 Samantha sensed that the woman was already a lesbian and thus the seduction was not a viable option. Yet, her pussy was still a weapon to potentially get what she wanted. "Let's go and discuss this somewhere more private." 

 "Of course, ma'am," Scarlett nodded, curious if the woman was expecting the full treatment. The full treatment was a secret that only the very elite knew about. For the right price, you would get a personal fitting, a dress designed personally for you and an orgasm to go with it. For the rich, the more extravagant and the more taboo, the more exciting Scarlett had long learned. And the reality that she could live like a rich woman now by catering to even richer women was something she enjoyed. 

 Scarlett led her to the extravagant back room and asked, "Would you like to try on some of our newest designs?" 

 Samantha said, her tone implying her annoyance, "I already told you what I wanted." 

 "And I already told you that wasn't a possibility," Scarlett returned. 

 "Isn't the customer always right?" Samantha asked. 

 "When possible," Scarlett said, before adding, "even if I wanted to give you the dress I don't have it. It's in New York." 

 "Really?" Samantha asked, "And who has it?" 

 "That is confidential," Scarlett said, realizing she had slipped up. 

 Samantha snapped her fingers and Chloe immediately moved to her Mistress and unzipped the back of her dress. 

 Scarlett was impressed by the power of the domme, but she had seen similar power moves before. 

 As the dress was slid down Samantha's perfect body, she continued, "I understand there are fringe benefits for some of your top clients." 

 Scarlett couldn't deny the woman had a beautiful body, she also couldn't deny she was attracted to her. She answered, "We offer a wide range of services, ma'am." 

 "It's Mistress," Scarlett corrected, now standing in front of the woman naked. 

 Scarlett addressed the client as she wished and nodded, "Yes, Mistress." 

 "Do you do the fringe benefits?" Samantha asked. 

 "Yes, Mistress," Scarlett nodded. "I believe in being a very hands on owner." 

 "As do I," Samantha smiled, as she walked to the leather couch and sat down. "Come and give me the full treatment." 

 "You understand the full treatment includes a pre-purchased dress of your choosing or new design, and a pair of Elegance thigh high stockings or pantyhose, and a signed disclaimer that you will wear the Elegance nylons whenever you wear the dress," Scarlett explained. A business deal she made with Carolyn a couple of years ago was that all her dresses now came mandatory with the Elegance brand nylons. 

 "What?" Samantha scoffed. 

 "My dresses and Elegance nylons are in a partnership," Scarlett revealed. "My dresses are the best in the world and Elegance nylons are the best in the world, so we got together and started a new line for the classiest women in the world." 

 "You expect me to wear nylons with a dress because you have a deal with another company?" Samantha asked, finding this ludicrous. 

 Scarlett shrugged, "I don't expect anything from you, ma'am, I mean Mistress. What I am saying is that the nylons are an accessory of the dress that you must purchase to get the dress and a contract must be signed to promise to wear both when you are seen in public in my creations." 

 "And if I break it?" Samantha questioned, impressed by the strong will of this woman which made her more determined to win. 

 "Legal action," Scarlett said, not something she had ever had to use. The truth was the elite who wore her dresses liked the idea of the exclusiveness of it. They also loved, once they put them on, the sheer silk of the Elegance stockings. 

 Pam Thomas was on the cover of People magazine in the dress with matching heels and nylons. The biggest 'it' girl at the moment loved the nylons so much that when asked who she was wearing at the Oscars, she said 'the dress is by the amazing Scarlett LeBouf and the nylons, which are the silkiest sheer nylons in the world, are Elegance Stockings'. 

 Pam Thomas loved the nylons and bought 100 pairs in a variety of colours and began wearing them every time she was seen in public and even in the movies she starred in. When the owner of Elegance Stockings, Carolyn Adams, met with her and asked her to be the spokeswoman for the brand she agreed and was now on billboards around the world in them and in a half dozen sexy commercials. 

 Samantha scoffed. "It wouldn't stand up in court." 

 Scarlett shrugged, "I don't mean to sound pretentious or egocentric, but my dresses are the best; Elegance stockings are the best. Putting the two together was a natural next step. You must have seen Pam Thomas wearing the nylons in public." 

 Samantha had and wondered why she was always wearing them. Yet, now it made sense. "Bring me a pair," she ordered, curious what all the hoopla was about. Nylons were nylons and she had tried a few expensive pairs in the past. 

 Scarlett went to an intercom and said, "Trenna, please bring me a pair of mocha Elegance thigh high stockings." 

 "Yes, ma'am," Trenna responded. 

 Samantha asked, as she waited, "So are you wearing Elegance stockings?" 

 "Of course," Scarlett nodded. "It's the only brand I will wear." 

 "Let me feel them,' Samantha ordered. 

 Scarlett moved to the pretty woman, and put her foot on the couch beside her. 

 Samantha put her hands on the woman's legs. She was surprised. Indeed, they were super soft. She moved her hands up and down the leg and agreed, "They are soft." 

 "And sexy," Scarlett added, lifting up her dress enough to showcase the unique design of the lace top of the stocking. 

 "Indeed they are," Samantha nodded. 

 Treena, a voluptuous blonde, entered the room and walked over to her boss and Mistress. "Here you are, Ms. LeBouf." 

 "Thank you, Treena," Scarlett said, taking the package. 

 Scarlett moved her leg back down and opened the package. Report_Story #6 

 

 ****** Obedience: A Study in Seduction ****** bysilkstockingsloverÂ© Samatha asked, "Is Treena a part of the full package?" 

 "She can be," Scarlett nodded, before adding, "all employees are available for special treatments when requested." 

 "Get undressed, Treena," Samantha said, wanting to get back in control, realizing she had allowed the situation to be led by the designer, whose name she'd already forgotten. 

 "Yes, ma'am," Treena said. This didn't happen often, but it wasn't the first time either. Her voluptuous breasts often attracted the women who came here as she learned early in life that big breasts were a blessing and a curse. A curse because it meant she was treated like a sex object by men; a blessing because it had made her an alluring object of lust for many rich and famous women. 

 Scarlett rolled up one stocking and said, "Could you please lift up your leg, Mistress?" 

 Samantha did, briefly looking down at the pretty woman who was on her knees and about to put the stocking on. 

 Treena's dress was off and now she was standing in her bra, panties (unfortunately it was that time of the month for her, otherwise she would not be wearing any) and thigh high stockings. 

 Samantha ordered, "Bra and panties too," as she glanced down to see the brunette slowly and carefully sliding the sheer nylon up her leg and to her thigh. 

 Treena unclasped her bra and revealed her large breasts, then explained, "Sorry, ma'am, but I need to keep my panties on for, ah, womanly reasons." 

 "Oh, of course," Samantha laughed, as she stared at the amazing tits. 

 "Other leg, please, Mistress," Scarlett asked. 

 Samantha didn't even look down as she switched legs. She asked Treena, "Do you eat cunt?" 

 "Yes, Mistress," the blonde bombshell answered, hearing her Mistress use the term 'Mistress' to the customer. 

 "Are you good at it?" Samantha asked. 

 "I believe so," Treena replied, knowing she was amazing at it, but not one to be arrogant. She was a submissive, not a dominant. 

 "Does she eat your pussy?" Samantha asked, looking down at the brunette whose hands were sliding up her calf at the moment. 

 "Of course," Scarlett nodded. "We are a very close business." 

 "Interesting," Samantha said, as the woman moved her hand to her thigh. 

 "Let me judge your ability, Treena," Samantha said, opening her legs wide. 

 "Yes, Mistress," Treena said, as Scarlett stood up and gave her employee and pet space to obey. 

 Treena moved into place and began licking, surprised to see the red bush. 99 percent of the women who came in here were completely shaved. She was also surprised by the subtle difference in taste from most pussies she pleased. 

 Samantha moaned and said, "So how do I get this dress?" 

 Scarlett repeated, "It was bought at auction for charity a week after the Oscars." 

 "Oh, by whom?" Samantha asked. 

 Scarlett said, realizing Samantha could google it and thus she wasn't really breaking confidentiality by telling her name said, "Carolyn Adams." 

 Samantha's face instantly paled. She asked, even though she had heard it clearly, "Did you say Carolyn Adams?" 

 "Yes, Mistress," Scarlett nodded, noticing the sudden change in demeanour of the woman. 

 Samantha grabbed the blonde's head and roughly held it deep in her pussy. She was suddenly furious. Carolyn Adams was a complete bitch. Carolyn Adams had stolen one of her pets, her most loyal pet, Carmen, from her a couple of years ago at a fundraiser for the SPCA. She had been pondering a way to get revenge ever since. She asked, "How well do you know Ms. Adams?" 

 Scarlett instantly knew something was up. She could see it in the woman's body language, hear it in her tone and sense it in her actions. Yet, confident that Mistress Carolyn could look after herself, she admitted, "She is the CEO of Elegance Stockings." 

 "Of course she is," Scarlett sighed. She had seen Carolyn as her arch enemy, her polar opposite. A Mistress who did things the old fashioned way. "So I can assume you are a pet of hers." 

 Scarlett didn't like where the conversation was going, already worried she had said too much. She answered, with a truth that didn't directly answer the question, "I have serviced her like I have many of my clients." 

 "I see," Samantha moaned, the blonde really working her pussy over. "I want the most expensive dress you have in stock." 

 Scarlett said, "That would be a gold dress with over five hundred diamonds and a price tag of over a million dollars." 

 "Bring it to me," Samantha said, money never an object. 

 "Of course, Mistress," Scarlett nodded, going to get it since her assistant was busy munching pussy. 

 Samantha closed her eyes, revenge on her mind. She was going to make the bitch crawl between her legs and beg to serve her. She wasn't sure how she was going to accomplish this yet, Carolyn was indeed a worthy adversary and not a typical seduction. She imagined Carolyn on her knees licking her pussy as her ex-pet Carmen was gang banged by men and impregnated as her punishment for her complete betrayal. She came quickly and was still recovering when Scarlett returned with the dress. 

 It was indeed beautiful and extravagant. 

 Samantha stood up and had the dress put on her. It fit almost perfectly, as if it was made for her in advance. 

 "Wow," the completely quiet until now Chloe said as she stared at her Mistress who suddenly looked like a royal princess. "You look amazing." 

 "Thank you my pet," Samantha nodded. "Big tits, go and please my assistant." 

 "Yes, Mistress," Treena obeyed, licking her lips to retrieve the last sweet remnants of the bitchy woman's pussy. A taste that was likely the best or second best she had ever tasted, Mistress Carolyn's being equally enthralling. 

 "Do you want to buy it?" Scarlett asked. 

 "Of course," she nodded. 

 "The mocha nylons are the perfect colour choice as well," Scarlett pointed out. 

 

 "I suppose they are," Samantha nodded, agreeing that the darker shade enhanced both her legs and the dress. 

 "I will get the contract ready then?" Scarlett said more as a question. 

 "Yes, please do," Samantha nodded, as she admired herself in the mirror, already thinking of ways of getting back at Carolyn. 

 Samantha paid for the dress, signed the agreement, bought three more pairs of the nylons, even though it killed her to give the money that would go back to Carolyn, made Scarlett give her a goodbye orgasm and headed back to the hotel. 

 As they got in the limo, she ordered, "Chloe, find out the next couple of week's itinerary 

 for Carolyn Adams." 

 "Of course, Mistress," Chloe nodded, not knowing who Carolyn was, but understanding clearly that her Mistress despised this woman. 

 Meanwhile, Scarlett texted Carolyn: 

 Are you awake? 

 We need to talk. 

 Carolyn was reading the paper, having her morning coffee and having her newest pet lick her pussy. It was the way she loved to enjoy the rare mornings when she had no morning meetings or engagements. 

 She looked at the text. This was unorthodox. She grabbed the phone and called Scarlett. 

 "Hi, my dear. What's up?" Carolyn asked. 

 Scarlett retold the entire encounter with Samantha Summers. 

 Once done listening, Carolyn said, "No, you didn't do anything wrong. I'll take care of it from here." 

 Hanging up, she smiled. Her live in maid and full time house pet back in New York was Carmen, a beautiful Latino who had the booty of Beyonce, the face of Jennifer Lopez and the breasts of Jennifer Love Hewitt. Carolyn had seduced her, taking her back to her hotel at a fundraiser a couple years ago unaware she was already collared by a Mistress. That said, like she always did, she gave her pet a choice. The pet chose her and had become her most loyal, hardworking submissive. 

 Samantha had threatened her the following week when Carmen chose to move in with her. It seemed to be an idle threat and she hadn't heard or even thought about the young wannabe Mistress since. 

 Yet, she couldn't help but think this coincidence would lead to more. 

 Of course, she revelled in the idea. She had defeated wannabe Mistresses before. And if it came down to it, she would again. 

 She returned to reading the paper, seeing a full page advertisement for the new Pam Thomas movie 'Kiss &amp; Tell' in which the top of her lace stockings were in clear view. She couldn't help but smile at the impact Pam Thomas wearing her stockings had had on business. 

 She grabbed her IPad and google searched Samantha Summers, trying to recall what she even looked like. As she read about the young woman, she leaned back and allowed her newest pet, Mindy, to please her. 

 Carolyn smiled, both from the eager tongue of her eager pet who woke up this morning with no misgivings about last night's submission and also at the many tabloid stories of Samantha Summers. 

 As her orgasm built she had no doubt that the next little while was going to be interesting, very, very interesting.
