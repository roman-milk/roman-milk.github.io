 (Mary) 

 I had been planning this trip for months. I was in an honors society in my freshman year of college. I had been helping out the underprivileged for years, dating back to my high school days. It was a cause I felt strongly about, and I wasn't about to change that once I started to live the college life. I joined within a month of the beginning of the school year. I quickly realized I was one of the most passionate members of the group, and even though most of the people there were older than me, they started to look to me for leadership. I did not shy away from it. I spearheaded a lot of the events that our society organized, and if I do say so myself, the society had never as active as it had been with me there. I looked forward to these meetings every week, at first for the cause, but later for another reason. I had met a boy. 

 I had never been the most popular girl in high school. I was one of those girls that was more worried about classes than partying. I was near the top of the class, but was woefully inexperienced with the opposite sex. By the time I entered college, I was still a virgin. 

 It's not that I'm bad looking. I'm quite cute if I do say so myself. I have shoulder length brown hair, a pretty face, and a nice set of 34B's. I would say my best feature is my butt, which provided a nice handful. Not that I've had a guy grab my butt, that's not the point. I could probably stand to lose five pounds, but I'd rather have a few extra pounds than be one of those model girls that look like they haven't eaten in a week. And those extra pounds look good on me anyway. 

 So, anyway, I had been in this honors society for a couple months when this boy started showing up. He didn't talk much at first, but eventually, he started coming out of his shell. I learned his name was Brian, and I couldn't take my eyes off of him. He was so cute. Every so often, he would quickly glance over at me, and I would quickly look away. I eventually found out he was a freshman, like me. As he attended more meetings, I started to realize he was as passionate about helping the underprivileged as I was. I could not love this boy more when I found this out. As the meeting ended, I hung around to help clean up. I noticed Brian hanging around, acting like he was busy. As I finished up, I started to head over to him. There were butterflies in my stomach. This was it. 

 "Hey, I don't think we've been properly introduced." I told him, holding out my hand. "I'm Mary." 

 "I'm Brian." He said, taking my hand in his. I felt sparks. 

 ********** 

 For the next few weeks, I was walking on air. Every time I saw him, my heart started to flutter. We got to know each other through the next few meetings. We worked together on a few events, and my crush just kept growing. I kept waiting for him to ask me out, because I knew he felt the same way. But he was so shy. I don't think he's ever done this before, either. Every one of the other girls in the honors society thought we looked really cute together, and they were in disbelief when they found out he hadn't asked me out yet. As Christmas break passed, I realized that I might have to step up and ask him out. I had never done that before, so I was understandably nervous. I built myself up, practiced what I wanted to say, ready for the first time I see him during the next semester to ask him out. But then something terrible happened. 

 His new schedule prevented him from attending the meetings. I was crushed. He was still part of the group. I would still see him at events, but I was never able to get a moment alone with him. This got me down, and caused me big problems. 

 I had always been pretty responsible. I never drank, never smoked, and never did drugs. I was down because I wasn't seeing more of Brian, so I let my friends drag me to a party. I suddenly was surrounded by drunk college kids, and quickly found a drink in my hand. I had one, then two, and then eventually I was pretty wasted. Of course, this party got busted, and I was one of the few not to sneak out, so I found myself getting taken to jail with an MIP. As I sobered up in the cell, I regretted all my decisions that night. I was so embarrassed. If my parents found out, if the honors society found out, if Brian found out. Ughhh. I was so mad at myself. I was finally given my phone call, and I tried calling my friends, but none of them responded. I couldn't call my parents or any of the others in the honors society without embarrassing myself in front of them due to my predicament. Then, I had a thought. Jenna, my roommate. She's not my best friend or anything. Actually, she was kind of annoying. She was a party girl, and spent all of her time talking to her friends on the phone, or texting them, or talking about them, or talking about boys. She's not that bad, we just come from different circles. I gave her a call, and luckily, she responded. 

 Within the hour, I was walking out of the police station with Jenna after she bailed me out. I was still so pissed at myself about this wild night. Never again, I vowed to myself. 

 "Jenna, thanks so much." I told her. 

 "Oh, no problem roomie. I know you'd do the same for me." Jenna responded. 

 "Yeah, definitely. I'll get you your money back for bail." I told her. 

 "Okay." She responded. 

 "I hope this stays between you and me, Jen. I don't want anyone else to know." I said to her. 

 "Of course. No problem." Jenna responded as we approached her car. 

 "Thanks. I owe you one." I told her as we got in the car. She smiled at me. 

 *********** 

 I was able to move on from this whole incident pretty quickly. Jenna, to my surprise, lived up to her word and didn't tell anyone, and for that I was very appreciative. She was usually such a gossip. Anyway, no one else found out about this, and I quietly dealt with the legal issues and it was quickly forgotten. 

 My crush on Brian soon returned to the forefront of my mind. I needed to find a way to be alone with him so I could make move on him, but that was getting difficult. I didn't just want to call and ask him. Asking someone out is something you do face to face. I racked my brain trying to figure out how to do this. This is when I started developing the plan. 

 I had done research and found out that there was this big home-building project in California that was supposed to happen at the beginning of summer. People from various charitable organizations all over the nation were sending people to help out. This was it. This was what I could do. I could get the honors society to send me and Brian out to California. Us together, far from home. I could make my move! 

 I brought this up to the group and they were supportive, but undecided. They were not sure if they wanted to send some people all the way out there. The society has funds that people donated to help us to do our projects. It would require a fair amount of money to send us out there. I pushed and pushed and pushed for this, and finally they relented, finally decided to send a group out there. Normally, for trips like this, they would send a group of four. It wouldn't be economical to just send one person out there. I tried to convince them that only two of us should go. We could travel on the cheap. It could work. I think when I was making this argument, the girl in charge, Jessica, knew what my intentions were. She knew I had a crush on Brian, and I wanted to make my move on him. It was with this in mind that she finally agreed to allow me to go with one other person. Policy dictated that she was to give me the set stipend of $1500, which was normally used for four people, but she highly encouraged me to do this on the cheap. I agreed. Now I just had one step left in my plan: I had to get Brian in on it. 

 I sent him an email, trying to hide my intentions the best I could. I basically explained to him that the group was looking for volunteers to go on this trip to California. I told him I was going in a very offhand way. I asked him if he was interested in going. I waited impatiently for him to respond, checking my email constantly. Finally, he replied. I checked the email quickly. He agreed! Oh my god! It had worked. I was going to get to spend a week of alone time with my crush. I started to imagine the possibilities. We'd be right near the ocean. We could hang out on the beach. Watch the sunset. Maybe kiss. Oh my god, I couldn't wait. After a little while, I emailed to let him know only me and him volunteered, and was wondering if he was okay with us traveling together, just him and me. He replied soon after, and he said that was fine. Actually, he used the word great. He was happy that it was just him and me! My heart fluttered. I couldn't wait. 

 The trip was scheduled right after the school year ended. Unlike most schools, they gave us a full week after exam week ended to move out of the dorms. After checking our exam schedules, we were gonna leave halfway through exam week, drive out to California, which would take about three days, spend four or five days out there, the head back with enough time to clean out our dorm rooms. Everything was good to go. 

 As the school year approached its end, the trip was all I could think about. I had told my parents and friends but I didn't tell Jenna. She knew I had a crush on Brian. I had told her all about him. I was afraid if I told her about this trip, she would make fun of me. She would know the real motive behind this trip. She knows that I'm not as experienced as some girls are, and she would tease me about it. Nothing too bad or too mean, just gentle prodding. But I think there was a little bit of her honest feelings about me shining through. I think she thought a little less of me because I had never been with a man. 

 She was the opposite of me in that sense. She was kinda slutty. There've been a few different boyfriends since the beginning of the school year, but I don't think they stuck around long enough to be official boyfriends. There have been many nights where she doesn't come back till the next morning. I can understand how each of her relationship's go. Boys are lured in by her looks. She is, admittedly, really hot. She has curly, black hair that goes down to her mid- back. She has a perfect tan, and her skin is smooth and flawless. Her face matched her attitude. She has full, smooth lips and she has what I've heard are called 'bedroom eyes.' I can't count the times I've seen her eyes flash with mischief. I can't imagine how they affected the boys she was with. Her body did not disappoint. Her butt was perfect; nice, round and heart-shaped. She had strong, smooth legs. And despite how catty girls can be about each other, I can truthfully say her boobs are spectacular. She always wears something tight to attract attention to them, but I think they would be noticed if she was wearing a paper bag. They are 36 DD's. I've seen them when she changed, and they look even better bare than they do covered. They are firm and perky, and despite their size, she could easily go braless and have no sag whatsoever. They are ridiculous. Even her nipples are the perfect size. The only reason she has to wear a bra is due to her perpetually hard nipples. Even when she's dressed down, in pajama pants and a hoody, she still looks amazing. Her perfect body makes the catty girl part of me just hate her. 

 Her attitude is what drives the boys away. She's kinda bitchy. She's so self- centered, so if a boy does something she doesn't like, she'll start acting like a princess and a spoiled brat. She's the type of girl who feels like a boy should be honored to be with her, so they should do whatever she wanted. Most boys don't find that an attractive feature in a girl. Even if they start catering to her whims, her bitchy, mean side starts to shine through quickly. I've seen her say just absolutely terrible things about other girls behind their backs. Some of the worst stuff I've ever heard. I hate to think what she says about me behind my back. Guys will stick with a hot girl for awhile, but if she is clearly as mean-spirited as Jenna can be, he aint sticking around long. In that sense, I feel I have the advantage over her. Yeah, I've never been with a boy, but when I do, I have no doubt it'll be a long lasting relationship. With her, she's been with lots of boys, but I doubt she'll ever be able to sustain a long-term relationship with any of them. She's just too bitchy. 

 Despite our differences, we actually get along fine. We both understand that we're completely different people. So, we just kinda stay out of each other's way. We clearly run in different social circles, so we're not threats to each other. We have a good give and take. She teases me about my lack of luck with boys, and I tease her about how she drives away boys. She's surprisingly self- aware about that side of her. When we are in the room together, she's usually talking on the phone, or texting, or on her computer. She generally doesn't bring boys back here, but when she does, I'll go down to the common room and do some homework, or read a book down there, or go hang out with some of my friends. We have a good system. 

 It was nearing the end of the semester. We both had our housing plans for the next year set. She was going to live in an apartment with some friends, as was I. I didn't really plan to keep in touch with her beyond this year. I would be cordial with her, and we may chat online, but I doubt we'll be hanging out much more beyond the end of the school year. Anyway, it was getting hard to avoid telling her my plans for the week after exams. Most of the students were gonna be partying once classes finished. Plus, the school had organized a few end-of- year events for the weekend. Beyond the weekend, it would be people moving out or just chilling out here until they had to go back home. 

 I was lucky and my exams finished up the Tuesday of exam week. Brian's did as well. I started to begin packing some of the stuff I would be taking on the trip. I packed my clothes, my laptop, and a few books to alleviate the boredom. Brian let me know he wouldn't be able to meet me here until about ten in the morning. We were taking my car on the trip. Jenna returned to the room as I was packing. I think she assumed I was packing to head home right away. I just let her go right on thinking that. 

 "Man, I am so glad exams are over." She told me, falling back onto her bed. 

 "Oh, yours are done too?" I asked her. 

 "Yep, just finished up my last one." She said, taking her phone out of her pocket. She started to text. I continued what I was doing. 

 "Must have been tough. I actually saw you studying." I teased. Jenna is many things. A good student is not one of them. 

 "Yeah, I know, right?" she replied, jokingly. "Looks like some of your bad habits passed off onto me." She added. I laughed. 

 "You getting ready?" she asked, not really paying attention. 

 "Yep." I said simply, not wanting to give away the truth. "You sticking around here?" I asked, trying to change the subject. 

 "Yeah. I have absolutely no desire to go home." She said, looking up at me from her phone, text sent. 

 "When does your lease start for your apartment?" I asked. 

 "August. Ughh, Four whole months at home. I might as well shoot myself now and get it over with." She said. Her phone beeped and she went back to texting. 

 "How bout yours? When does it start?" she asked. 

 "August, just like yours." I told her. 

 "We should hang out before school starts back up." She told me. I don't really think she wanted to hang out again. I think she was just being polite. 

 "Yeah, maybe." I told her, not really planning on pursuing it. 

 "You gonna go to any of the parties? Or any events the schools putting on?" I asked. 

 "Those events look lame." She started. I didn't think they looked that bad. "I'll probably go to some of the parties. They'll probably suck though." 

 "Yeah, probably." I responded, not really paying attention while I was folding some clothes. 

 "You know, these next couple weeks are gonna be fucking boring. I'll probably fucking lose it being cooped up here." She said. 

 "Your friends leaving?" I asked. 

 "Yep." She responded, continuing to text. "I don't know. I'll probably just go to the gym or something." She added, trailing off. I continued packing in silence as she continued. About twenty minutes later, she sat up on her bed. 

 "Man, I'm so fucking bored right now. Wanna do something?" she asked. 

 "Not really. I want to get an early start tomorrow." I told her. 

 "Well, then, Mary, what am I gonna do with myself for the next few hours?" she asked. 

 "Well, you could go meet a guy then break up with him. That'll kill a few hours." I joked. 

 "Ha. Ha. Ha. Go fuck yourself." She told me. I smiled. 

 "I'll actually miss this." I told her. 

 "Me too." She said. She started to grab some stuff, getting ready to head out. "If I don't get to talk you tomorrow, then this might be goodbye." She said. She puts a mock pout on her face. I smiled, walked over, and gave her a hug. 

 "Keep in touch, Mary." She told me. 

 "Yeah, you too." I replied. She left the dorm. I packed for a little while longer before finally calling it an early night. I was too excited about tomorrow to want to stay up any longer. I just wanted to get to bed so I could wake up and it'll be tomorrow. I couldn't wait. 

 *********** 

 I woke up at eight in the morning. I showered and started to clean up. I start to do some last minute packing. I tried to remain quiet, but despite my best efforts, Jenna began to awaken. She was usually a heavy sleeper, but of course today of all days she had to wake up early. She went to the bathroom and cleaned herself up. She watched me pack for a minute before speaking. 

 "What about your other stuff?" she asked, gesturing to some of the items I wasn't taking with me. 

 "Oh, I'll get it when I get back." I told her without thinking. I quickly realized the error I made. 

 "Wait, you're coming back?" she asked confused. I'm mad at myself for letting my plans slip out. I was just gonna leave a note telling her I would be back for the rest of my stuff later. Well, no point lying now. 

 "Yeah, I'm not going home immediately." I told her. 

 "I could've sworn you told me you were?" she asked. 

 "Nope. My honors society is sending some people out to California for this home-building event. I'm heading out today." I explained. 

 "Wait, you're going to California? Why didn't you tell me?" she asked. Then, the truth started to dawn on her. 

 "Wait a minute. Is Brian going?" she asked with a smile. 

 "As a matter of fact he is coming with." I told her. 

 "Aww, that's so cute. You gonna make your move?" she asked. 

 "That's the plan." I replied. 

 "So is there more people going or is it just you two?" she inquired. 

 "It's just us two." I told her. 

 "Aww, that's sweet." She told me. Her mocking tone is starting to annoy me. Then, Jenna had a revelation. "Ohmygod. You should totally let me come with you?" she asked. Bad idea. 

 "Jenna, no. I planned this out for a long time. I planned it to be us two. Please don't get involved." I pleaded with her. 

 "Just listen. No offense, but you don't know what you're doing. I can help you. I can give you advice. I can help this whole thing happen." Jenna pleaded with me. 

 "Jenna, I can handle this myself." I told her. 

 "Listen, if you screw this up, this could be it. You could drive him away for good. If you handle this wrong, you could make the biggest mistake of your life." She replied. I gave what she said some thought. "I know what I'm doing. Let me go with you guys. I can get a handle on what this Brian guy is all about. Then, I'll let you know what your best approach is." I considered what she said. "Please, pretty please Mary. I don't want to be cooped up here. You know what I'm saying is right."  

 

 ****** The Trip ****** byTheTalkMan© "Jenna, this is a charity thing. We'll be building houses. No offense, but you're not exactly the type to get your hands dirty." I replied, trying to dissuade her. 

 "Whatever. I don't care. I can help out. I'm sure no one will turn away the help. If not, I can stand on the sidelines or something." She replied. 

 "Jenna, I'm leaving in like an hour. You couldn't possibly get packed in time." I told her. 

 "Watch me." She said, grabbing her bag and starting to stuff it with clothes. I was still unconvinced. 

 "Jenna, please. I want to do this alone." I told her, desperate to change her mind. She stopped packing and walked over to me. 

 "Mary. Listen, you owe me." She said, dropping her trump card on me. She bailed me out of jail. She kept quiet about it. I hate to admit it, but she was right. I shook my head, angry. The logical side of me realized there was no reason not to take her. The stipend was an amount for four people to travel comfortably. Traveling with three people wouldn't be an issue, money wise. There was no reason to not take her. Like she said, no one would turn away the help. There wasn't an issue with money, and, yes, I did owe her. I was too good-hearted to say no to her. 

 "C'mon, Mare. It'll be room 201's last ride." Jenna added. 

 "Fine." I said, annoyed. 

 "Yay!" she said, bouncing up and down and clapping. She came over to me and hugged me. "Don't worry, Mary. You won't regret it." 

 *********** 

 Somehow, my bitchy roommate had wormed her way into my romantic moment. I was pissed. I didn't even talk to her as she quickly packed. I'm sure she picked up on my annoyance, but she didn't care. She was clearly excited. She was bouncing around, packing quickly. True to her word, she was packed with time to spare. She had packed double what I had packed. Of course, she couldn't make this easy. We started to head down to the parking lot to put our stuff into my car. 

 My car wasn't too flashy. It was a small, red little thing. It was economical and had good gas mileage. That's why we were taking it. Once we put all of our bags into the trunk, it was almost full. We were gonna have to put Brian's stuff in the back seat. I heard a car pull in a few spots down, then a horn honk. I turned around and see someone emerging from a car. It was Brian! 

 As he emerged from his car, it struck me again how effortlessly good looking he was. He didn't have to try. His hair looked tussled, but in way that suited him. He smiled that cute smile of his. He was dressed in relaxed clothes, comfortable, but still flattering to his impressive body. I still can't believe that this boy is in to me. I headed over towards him as he walked towards me. Jenna hung near the car. 

 "Hey, what's up?" I said, with a smile. 

 "Not much. You ready?" he asked. 

 "Yeah, there's one thing though." I started, about to break the bad news. 

 "What?" he said suddenly worried. 

 "My roommate cashed in a favor I owed her. She wants to come too." I said. 

 "Oh, okay." he said, a little surprised. 

 "Is that all right? I mean, I know this wasn't part of the plan, and she's not in the society." I started. 

 "No, it's fine. Whatever. The more help the better." He said, always finding the best of any situation. 

 "Are you sure? Because, if you're not, she doesn't have to come." I suggested, hoping he would take me up on it. 

 "No. It's cool." He replied. He was too nice to ever turn someone away. 

 "Okay." I replied nervously. I started to lead him over to my car and to Jenna. As I led him over, her eyes opened wide and she smiled as she took him in. She held her hand out. 

 "Hi, I'm Brian." He said, taking her hand in his. 

 "Nice to meet you. I'm Jenna." She said with a cute little smile. 

 "Uh, I'd better go get my stuff." He stammered heading back over to his car. As he did, we both watched him. 

 "He is so cute." Jenna whispered in my ear. I smiled. He came back over with only two bags. One large and one small. He was courteous as always. He packed less than either of us. We put his bags into the back seat. 

 "It's getting hot out." He said, wiping some sweat from his brow. 

 "Yeah, I know. It's going to get even hotter as we get out west." I replied. 

 "You got that right." Jenna added. She volunteered to sit in the back seat, while I drove and Brian would ride in the passenger seat. Before we set out, I wanted to take care of some business. I turned to Brian. 

 "Hey, would you mind if I put you in charge of the stipend?" I asked him. 

 "Yeah, no problem." He said, taking the leather packet which housed the money. 

 "Stipend? What stipend?" Jenna asked. 

 "The society gave us some money for us to cover our funds during the trip." I explained. 

 "How much?" she asked. 

 "About $1500." I replied. 

 "Wow. Sweet. We should go do something." She offered. 

 "This money is only for necessary expenses. If you want to 'do stuff', it's coming out of your pocket. This money was donated to us so we would be able to help the underprivileged. I want to use as little of this as possible. It's not for frivolous stuff." I explained, annoyed at her self-centeredness. I can see her roll her eyes in my peripheral vision. 

 "All right, all right. Just a suggestion. I didn't know." Jenna explained. I laid out my plans for where we would stop. Once I did, and once we were ready, I pulled out of the spot, and started to head out. The trip was a go. 

 *********** 

 It was a couple of hours into the trip when the first speed bump happened. Everything was going great. We were chatting and having a great time. Brian was really coming out of his shell. Then, the AC went out in my car. There's was nothing we could do short of taking the car into the shop, which was not an option, so we would just have to tough it out. I was fine with it, and Brian, ever the optimist, was fine with it as well. Jenna, not so much. 

 "Are you kidding? It's really fucking hot out. We should, like, stop and get it fixed, or, like, rent a car or something." She whined. 

 "Jenna, we can't afford it. We just have to tough it out." I explained. 

 "This is a necessary expense. You don't expect us to drive all the way to California sweating like pigs, do you?" she asked, clearly annoyed. 

 "Jenna, the people we are driving out to help don't even have homes. They would consider it a blessing to have air conditioning." I explained. I look at Brian and roll my eyes. He smiled. In the circles we run in, we just can't stand people who act so entitled. Like a princess. It seemed like Jenna was about to say something else, but she held her tongue. She pulled out her phone and started to text. We rolled down the windows and drove in silence. We were all starting to sweat. With the windows down, it was hard to talk over the roar of the air blasting in through the windows. Eventually, the tension started to dissipate. 

 As we hit some traffic and had to slow down, the conversation started to pick up again. Brian would tell some stories, which would make both of us laugh. Jenna's mood started to pick up, despite the heat. She was chatting as if nothing ever happened. She talked to Brian more than me, but that was fine. I could tell she was feeling him out. I could tell Jenna was still annoyed at the heat, but she hid it better. I think Brian picked up on this too. He suggested we stop at a gas station and pick up some cold drinks, and maybe a cooler with some ice. I agreed, as we needed to get gas anyway. We stopped at the cheapest gas station I could find. As I got out to pump gas, Brian went inside to get the supplies. Jenna got out to stretch her legs. She walked over to me. 

 "So what do you think of him?" I asked, wanting her opinion. 

 "He's great. I can see why you like him. He's totally, like, husband material." She told me. 

 "Do you think I'm doing okay?" I asked. 

 "Yeah, you're doing fine. You guys are great together. Just keep doing what you're doing." She explained. Sage wisdom, Jenna. Thank god I brought her along for nuggets of info like that. I finish pumping the gas. Brian payed for it inside, and emerged with some cold Cokes and water's in a decent sized cooler filled with ice. He put it in the middle of the back seat. I get into the driver's seat waiting for them to follow. I see Jenna waiting for Brian to get the cooler set. For a second I thought I saw her look at his butt, but when I looked back again, she was not. Brian got the cooler set and sat back into the passenger seat. I looked back in the mirror, and my eyes met Jenna's. I couldn't read her expression. I have always had trouble telling what her mood was based on her expression. I have no idea what she was thinking. That's probably for the best. I jump backed on the highway, and the drive continued. 

 *********** 

 (Jenna) 

 The plan changed the minute I met Brian. I just wanted to go to California. Maybe go to the beach, wear a teeny bikini, and maybe meet a cute Cali boy. I was honest when I told Mary I would help her with her cute little crush. I had never met this guy, but Mary wouldn't stop talking about him. I figured this Brian was some nerdy guy. Probably a nerd like Mary. I liked Mary, even though she was kind of lame. But I figured I would be unusually charitable and help Mary get this guy, with the help of my considerable talents at landing men. Then I met Brian. 

 My mouth opened in genuine surprise when I saw Brian walk towards Mary after getting out of his car. 'Who is that hot guy talking to Mary' I wondered to myself. This was not what I expected at all. When he came over and held out his hand to mine, I gave his hand a gentle squeeze and flashed my eyes at him. He was too innocent to notice. That was so cute. 

 As the drive began, I couldn't get Brian out of my head. I kept checking him out whenever I got the chance. He was clearly a virgin. With a boy that hot, if he was getting laid, he would be getting laid constantly. If you're getting laid that constantly, you wouldn't be shy. 'What a waste?' I thought to myself. Then, like a bolt of lightning, a plan hit me. A new plan, a better plan than the one before. 

 A guy like Brian would be wasted on Mary. An uptight girl like her doesn't deserve him. The only guys who are interested in her are the ones who don't know any better. I could show him better. He's a young guy, probably 19, same age as me, but he was so different from the older college guys that are usually after me. His destiny could still be molded. He could be molded, changed, corrupted. Mary had no idea what she brought on herself by letting me come along. He was a nice boy, too shy to ask out the girl he was crushing on. But to me, that was such an awkward, teenage thing to do. I could show him how an adult relationship works. Show him what adult guys should do to hot girls. He started this trip interested in Mary. She was sweet, funny, and selfless. I was a mean, bitchy, selfish princess. But I was also fucking hot. And that's all that mattered. 

 He's never dealt with someone like me. In any facet that matters, I was superior to Mary. I had longer, sexier, more stylish hair. I was tanner. I always dressed more fashionably than Mary. My legs were long and sexy. My face was much prettier. My ass was rounder and fuller. And my massive, perky breasts obliterated whatever Mary's got. I was superior in every way, and Brian was about to realize that, because he was about to get a good look at my body, a good look at what I have to offer. 

 I regretted wearing the clothes I had on now, just a plain pink tank top and jeans. I had dressed quickly, without thinking. But I vowed to change that. I would wear tighter clothing, sluttier clothing. I would wear as little as I could get away with. And Mary wouldn't realize a thing, because she knows I'm a slut, and that I like to wear slutty clothing. It's the norm for a slut like me. She wouldn't realize anything, but her cute little boyfriend would. Her cute little innocent boyfriend wouldn't know what to do with a slut like me in his life. Being trapped in a car with me, it'd be impossible for him to not notice. Notice the cleavage I was going to bare for him. Notice my long legs that I planned to give him a good look at. Notice my full sexy lips, in a perpetual pout. Notice my smoky, sexy eyes that would always be on him. There would be no way he could be trapped in a car with a complete slut in as little clothes as possible, and plain as hell Mary, and not compare the two. There would be no way Mary would come up as anything but inferior in every way. 

 I would drive him nuts by the mere sight of my body. His natural male instincts would make him gravitate to me. I could sense which guys had large equipment, and I could tell that he was huge. I would induce massive amounts to cum to build up in his no doubt huge balls. Being trapped in a car, he would have no way to take care of it. All that cum, and nowhere to go with it. And when he reached the point where he could take it no longer, he wouldn't go to Mary to take care of him. She was too nice to do what was necessary. He would turn to me. The massive amount of cum that will build up in his balls will find a home deep inside my wet cunt. And when that happens, when Brian's hard no-longer- virginal dick would be smothered by the warm tightness of my slutty cunt, he would want nothing else. There's no going back for a man once he started to fuck slutty girls. And I would make a man out of him. When I got done with him, he would no longer be shy, selfless cute boyfriend Brian. He would be a pussy- crazed man who would betray the girl who clearly loves him in favor of the dark delights that a slut like me could offer. 

 It was with this thought, the thought of corrupting Brian, of stealing him away from a clueless Mary, that hardened my nipples even more. My pussy became wet. I looked at the back of Mary's head. In my mind, I had one thought: 

 "Sorry roomie, but you're at war." 

 *********** 

 (Mary) 

 I drove for as long as I could before we finally decided to stop for the night. We pulled into the cheapest hotel that we could find that didn't look too shady. The only rooms they had were one bed, so we decided that me and Jenna would share the bed, and Brian offered to sleep on the floor. We unpacked what we needed to and found our room. It wasn't the greatest thing in the world, but it would do. We picked up some fast food. Brian and I got some burgers, and Jenna got a salad. We ate the food in the room. We were all pretty zonked out from the drive, so we decided to go to bed early. Brian got changed in the bathroom, as Jenna and I waited for him to emerge so we could each make use of the bathroom. 

 He walked out in just a pair of gym shorts. It was the first time I had seen him shirtless, and he did not disappoint. He clearly was in great shape. I could see the muscles on his chest and stomach. I had to stop myself from drooling. He didn't notice anything amiss as he walked by us. I looked over at Jenna as she looked at me. We shared a giggle in admiration. Jenna went into the bathroom next. She quickly emerged in a tight black tank top and gray and purple pajama pants. I quickly changed into a t-shirt and pajama pants. I was disappointed when I saw that she was on the same side of the bed that he was. Typical. I didn't want to start anything, so I just slipped into bed. 

 It was not a comfortable night. It was hot outside, and it was stuffy on the inside. I was able to get a few hours sleep, but I woke up early and I was so uncomfortable with the heat that I wasn't able to fall back asleep. I finally committed to being awake around six, so I took a quick shower, which felt great by the way. I tried to quietly pack my bags. But I wasn't quiet enough, and Brian woke up. I smiled at him, and he smiled back, as he walked into the bathroom. He took a quick shower, and soon joined me to pack. We got as much as we could packed as the sun started to rise. Jenna was still asleep, surprise, surprise. Typical of her to avoid hard work. It reached the point that we were almost ready to go, but we were waiting on her to wake up. We started to pack loudly, trying to wake her up. I had hoped to get an early start, but Jenna was not helping. Finally, I had to wake her lazy ass up. She said to give her a few minutes, and that she'll be out soon. 

 Brian and I decided to wait outside. We chatted for a bit, and it was nice. This was the first time we really had any privacy. We were talking about nothing really, just small talk. I could tell we were dancing around the real thing we both wanted to talk about. The sun was rising. It was a beautiful morning. The temperature was cool right now, and it was quiet. I realized this is it. This is the moment. I might not get another chance at this. I turned to him. 

 "Hey, I was thinking..." I started to say, when we both heard the door open. Out emerged Jenna, bag in hand. She was wearing a tight blue halter top, and short, tight, cutoff shorts. She had put on large sunglasses. She always tried to act like one of those Hollywood party girls. I looked at Brian and rolled my eyes. He smiled. 

 "I don't know about you guys, but I did not get any sleep last night." She said to us. 

 "Yeah, I didn't get much either." I told her. 

 "Yeah." Brian added. 

 "Hey, Brian, would you mind getting my bag? I couldn't carry it." She said. 

 "Sure." Brian said, heading into the room. 

 "So, did you ask him?" she said, once Brian was out of earshot. 

 "Well, I was about to when you came out." I said. 

 "Oh. Sorry." she replied. Brian emerged seconds later with Jenna's bag. We quickly packed it up, and checked out of the hotel. Brian offered to drive. Such a gentleman. I took the passenger seat, while Jenna hung in back. We picked up a quick breakfast, then continued on. 

 *********** 

 (Jenna) 

 Today was the day I began my plan to seduce Brian. I watched him sleep most of the night. He had a great body, and a few quick glances at his shorts confirmed my earlier suspicions: He was big. Like, really big. Finding this out for sure made my pussy moist. I fought the urge to touch myself, but stopped myself. I had to be patient. The next orgasm I would have would be with Brian's massive dick buried inside me. 

 I finally fell asleep later on in the night. I could tell they were both annoyed that I slept in, but so what? They could wait. I took a nice shower, but tried to keep it pretty quick. I didn't want to give them too much alone time. I quickly found some of my short shorts and my blue halter. Brian would start to understand today what I had to offer. I made myself look perfect and stepped out the door. 

 I could immediately tell that Mary was annoyed. I had to stop myself from smiling when she said that she was about to ask him out when I interrupted. That was a close one. 

 The drive was even more uncomfortable than the day before. It was just so hot. We were all sweating as we reached the afternoon. It was uncomfortable, yes, but it actually helped me in my plan. To be honest, I looked great with a sheen of sweat of me. Many guys could tell you that. I reached into the cooler to grab an ice cube. I leaned up and rub the cube against my forehead. The water dripped down my face and down onto my chest. It started to soak my top a little bit. I looked up into the mirror, and saw Brian's eyes dart away. 

 Ha! So he's started to notice. Well, time to turn it up a bit. I grabbed another ice cube, and started to rub it on my chest, just above my breasts. The water drips all over my large breasts. Down the top of them, soaking my top. Or right between them, disappearing in the cavern of my cleavage. I look up into the mirror. He's staring right at me. Or at my tits, to be specific. I drop the cube down my cleavage. I see him gulp. I stare at the mirror until he noticed that I noticed. He looked away and his cheeks turned red. I smiled. Of course, clueless in the passenger seat didn't notice a thing. This was almost too easy.  

 

 ****** The Trip ****** byTheTalkMan© I tried to keep doing something. Either text, or talk to someone on the phone, or talk to them. Anything that would get Brian's attention on me. When he looked back on this trip, I wanted the first thing he remembered to be me. I want him to eventually forget the fact that Mary was even on the trip. 

 I had a moment's remorse for Mary. She really didn't stand a chance. I really did like her. This was nothing personal. We always got along well. But all's fair in love and war. This wasn't cattiness between girls at the sight of a new man. This was something more. I felt like I had just discovered something, something deep inside me. I had never had any problems getting men. But I had never encountered a situation like this. I had never tried to steal another girl's man before. Just the thought of driving a man so crazy, of turning him on so much, that he forgot all about his loving girlfriend and just had to fuck me. Making a man ditch a possible future wife to start banging some slutty girl he barely knows. Driving all reason from his mind, making him a slave to his own sexual desires. Making him make such a bad choice for himself, but a great choice for the slutty girl. Most decent men know better than to fuck slutty girls. That has been instilled in them by their parents, by society. To drive that all away, to convince them that a slut can provide them all they truly need. To drive a man down to their base desires, their base urges. To reduce a man to the simple and undeniable urge to fuck. Not to make love or any of that bullshit. To fuck. When a man's reduced to that, they don't go after the pretty girls, the funny girls. No, they follow their instincts. They go after the girls that they know can fuck well. The slutty girls, the sexy girls. It doesn't matter how nice they are, how funny they are. All that matters is how hot they are. How sexy they are. How long their legs are. How round their asses are. How big their tits are. How tight their pussy's are. That would be all that matters. 

 I felt like I had just discovered who I truly was. I had always thought I was just a slutty girl. A girl that guys want to bang. And I was fine with that. I like sex, and I am great at sex. I had come to the realization that the sex was the endgame, not the whole game. The art was in the seduction. It was not about finding the nearest frat guy who was down to fuck. It was about finding the ideal guy, guys who don't just come along all the time. Men who girls had already snatched up, more than likely. The art was in using all of your feminine wiles to change these men, to bring them down to the level where maybe fucking a slut isn't so bad. To shape a good man into the man a slut needs him to be. To show them that all they truly need is a slut like me. 

 Society has always told you that good people deserve the best. You have to be good, and good things will happen. Girls are always told not to be sluts. To be good, wholesome girls. They are told if they do this, they will get a good man, 2.5 children, and house with a white picket fence. But, to buck the system so severely? To make it where being a slut is the best way to get ahead. To let the good boys and girls grow up, be successful, and then for a slut to come in at the last minute after doing nothing to deserve it, steal the good man, live the good life and leave the good girl behind. For a woman to slut it up and be rewarded. To be a slut, but by choosing the right man to steal, still live the good life. To have the nice car, to have the money, to have the children that the good girls thought they deserved. To be a bad girl and get rewarded? An easy girl living the easy life. The thought made me smile. 

 I now realized my place in this world. I was exactly where I was supposed to me. I was an unrepentant slut. A whore. But I had been those things for years. I was now something new. Something greater. I was now a seductress. A temptress. I now knew the way forward. Brian was the future. I had told Mary that they were great for each other, that he was husband material. Yeah, he'd be great for Mary. But he'd perfect for me. He was perfect husband material for a slut like me. 

 Where would this leave poor Mary? I obviously was gonna succeed at fucking Brian. There was no question of that. But where does Mary fit into all of this? I had to decide what to do with her. After I start fucking Brian, do we flaunt it to her, show her inferiority to me, and leave her in the dust? Do I break her heart as I steal her man? The thought was undeniably hot to me. But I then had a thought. A new more plan, one which was more elegant. Mary would be too clueless to ever figure out that I was fucking her man unless I flaunted it in her face. She was that naive. But what if I didn't do that? What if I stole her true love, and she never realized it. What if they did start to date? What if I continuously fucked her man behind her back? He would go to her for the cute stuff, but he would come to me for the adult stuff. The rough stuff. And if a man has to choose which he'd rather have, he wouldn't be able to deny his natural urges. He would want to maintain our relationship more than anything she could offer. 

 As I stared at Mary's napping form, she had no idea her future was in my hands. She was relaxed, secure that her true love would eventually work out. I would never stop. I would never get complacent. I would work hard to get him. I deserved a man like him more than her. The more I fucked him, the more I would change him. As Mary's and Brian's relationship would progress, the changes in him would grow. Mary would start to realize that maybe Brian was more of a man than she thought. More of a man than she could handle. He would not be able to make the gentle love to her, like she no doubt wanted. He would want to fuck. Hard. A nice, gentle girl like her is not built to handle that kind of serious fucking. The kind of fucking that only a slut like me could handle. They would no doubt start to grow apart. They would both know they do not belong with each other. They would break up. Her heart would break. But breaking things down makes them stronger once they are rebuilt. 

 Mary would move on to a slightly lesser man, a boy that she could handle. A boy who would not demand the tough, demanding sex a man needs. It would be the closest thing she could have to a real adult relationship. It would be a lame relationship obviously. The type with cute little dates, with roses and chocolates, and missionary style sex. It would be lame uninspired sex, and the boy she was with would no doubt look to stray. But she would never notice, because she's naïve. She would be happy in the relationship, because it's the best she could ever hope to get. Once they graduated, they would live in some crappy apartment together, not wanting to live too highly because of her awareness of the underprivileged. 

 Brian would graduate to fucking a slut full time. He would move on to being with me. He would get all the sex he could handle, in all of the positions he wanted. There would be no limits. It would be the relationship he needed. He is the type of guy that will be successful. He would live the good life, and I would be at his side. He would move on from all this charity crap he was worried about, and would move onto something more adult. He would live to make my life great. And the best part of the whole thing: I would not hide the fact that I was dating Brian from Mary. I would tell her. I would be the compassionate friend and confess to her that I was with her ex. I would ask if it was okay with her. And it would be. She would give me her approval. Part of her would still love Brian, and would want him to be happy. She would be happy that I was settling down with a man, her man. She would accept it because deep down, she knew Brian showed her that he needs a woman more able to handle his insatiable lust. A woman like me. A slut like me. 

 Mary would know deep down that Brian and me would be a very sexually compatible couple. She would know that the sex that happens between us would be something that she would never be able to match. And she would accept it. Deep down it'll bother her, but she'll accept our love. She'll wonder when our love started. She'll realize that it started here, that it is her fault that Brian ended up with me. But she would be too nice to say anything. She'll harbor this anger inside herself for losing Brian, but she'll never give any outward clue of it. She'll give her blessing to our relationship. I can see this all working out towards that very fact. I'll steal her man, on her romantic trip. And she'll give her approval to us. She'll blame herself for losing Matt, not the evil slut who stole him. I'll still be friends with her. We could become best friends. I'll invite her to the wedding. She'll be my maid of honor. I'll rub my relationship with her ex in her face and she won't even hate me. I am on the verge of cumming right now. My clit was so fucking hard. 

 The only thing standing between me and this future was to convince Brian to fuck me. I leaned back and place both of my bare feet between the front seats next to him. 

 "So, Brian, tell me about yourself." I asked him. We had not really talked at all, beyond chit chat. Mary was still asleep. This was our first chance at a private, personal conversation. 

 "Uh, what do you want to know?" he stammered nervously. 

 "Well, tell me about yourself. What's your major? What do your parents do? What are your hobbies? If we're spending a week and a half together, we should get to know each other." I replied, bouncing my bare feet back and forth. 

 "He, uh, well, I'm going into business. My dad runs this company, and he wanted me to go to one of the higher end schools, where he went. He wanted me to use his money. But, I wanted to do my own thing, be a self-made man. Not a guy who lives off his dad's money. So, I'm paying my way through school." Brian explained. 

 "Hm, that's cool, Brian. Most guys wouldn't do that." I replied, trying to hide my excitement at the fact that he was loaded. 

 "My mom doesn't work." Brian started. I like her style. "A far as hobbies, it's what we're doing now." Hanging out with a slut, I thought. "Helping people. I've been blessed to be born with money. Most people aren't. I want to help as many people as I can live better lives." He finished. There's only one person he has to help live a better life. 

 "How about you?" he asked. 

 "Well, I have no clue what I'm gonna major in. My parents are boring school teachers. And I mainly like to party. So college is great so far." I told him. I see him nod. I can tell that he doesn't think much of what I just told him. I bet he looks down on me. I bet he thinks that I'm a self-centered princess, which is not wrong. Soon, he will realize that that's the type of girl he needs in his life. 

 "So, you gonna be helping us out at the build?" he asked. I shrugged my shoulders. 

 "I don't know. I was just hoping to go to the beach. Work on my tan." I told him. He nodded again. "Oh, c'mon, don't give me that look, Brian." I added. 

 "What look?" he stammered. 

 "You think I'm being a spoiled brat." I said. 

 "No, not at all." He stammered again. I giggle at his nervousness. 

 "Brian, I'm kidding. I'm gonna help out at the build." I said. Not bloody likely, I thought. 

 "Oh, heh, good one." he said, still clearly nervous. 

 "Do I intimidate you Brian?" I asked. 

 "No, not at all. What makes you say that?" he replied. 

 "Brian, you look terrified. You need to loosen up." I explained. Probably hard to relax with a hard dick full of cum bursting for release at the sight of a hot slut in the backseat. In that sense, I could really help him loosen up. 

 "I'm not scared." he replied. 

 "Yes you are." I replied, my voice getting huskier. I'm really fucking horny right now. Suddenly, Mary started to stir. I pulled my feet back. 

 "Hey, what's up?" she asked Brian. 

 "Not much." he replied. He's obviously not including his hard dick. 

 "How long was I out?" Mary asked. 

 "About an hour and a half." He replied. Mary looked back at me. I smiled. She might have noticed my hard nipples, but she didn't say anything. I was not bothered by her waking up. I could be patient. It's only a matter of time. He will be mine soon. 

 *********** 

 (Mary) 

 We had found another hotel for the night. It was the same deal as before. One bed, which me and Jenna shared, and Brian on the floor. I had asked him if he was sure if he wanted to do that, but he had insisted. I aced out Jenna this time and slept on the same side as Brian. 

 It was another sticky night. I watched Brian sleep for a little while before finally falling asleep myself. I admired his fit frame as he slept, looking so peaceful. 

 The morning went about the same as the previous. Me and Brian were the first two up while Jenna slept. She eventually did wake up on her own. As we were packing, Jenna showered. I was trying to pack quickly to try and get another moment alone with Brian, but it was not meant to be. Jenna came bouncing out as we neared being done packing. She looked like she was in a great mood. 

 "Morning guys." She said. I didn't quite hear her. I was too distracted by what she was wearing. She was wearing a tight, stretchy pink tank top. Her boobs wear pouring over the edges. She was clearly not wearing a bra, for the second straight day. Her nipples were clearly outlined under her top. And Jenna had busted out her booty shorts. They were tiny, black, stretchy shorts that barely went down an inch or so below her ass. It molded around her ass like a second skin. Even I could admire how good she looked. I only wish she wasn't wearing it around Brian. 

 "Brian, can you get my bag again?" she asked. Brian obliged and went inside. 

 "What the hell are you wearing?" I asked. 

 "What! It's too fucking hot to wear much else." She replied. I rolled my eyes. Brian emerged with Jenna's bag. We packed it and were quickly on our way. 

 ********** 

 (Jenna) 

 We were in the middle of the desert when we stopped to get gas. I hopped into the gas station to pick up some water. It was ridiculously hot out. Like, unbelievably hot out. My body was dripping with sweat. I made sure to shake my ass at Brian as I walked into the gas station and he started to pump the gas. The dimwit in the gas station couldn't take his eyes off me. I walked back outside and Brian watched me every step of the way. Mary was waiting patiently in the passenger seat. I opened my water and started to gulp it down. This gave Brian a chance to stare at my body without being seen. I have to admit, I looked like a total slut in this outfit. My tits were bulging out, begging to be admired. My long legs were almost fully exposed to him. And the sheen of sweat all over me just added to my sexiness. I gulped down the water, and then looked back at him. He was still looking, but then he noticed me and looked away. I giggled. We set out from there soon after. 

 It was clear that Brian could not keep his eyes off of me. Every time I looked up, he was staring. He could feel the pheromones I was exuding. He was becoming obsessed with my body. He was falling in love with me. I did not stop him from admiring me. Mary, of course, noticed nothing. 

 It was late in the afternoon when we arrived at our destination in California. We all walked into the office of the small hotel. I pulled Mary aside. 

 "Hey, you're not getting just one room again, right?" I asked her. 

 "Yeah. Listen, Jenna, we are trying to do this cheaply. We can't get you your own room." She started, annoyed. 

 "No, I'm not talking about me. Listen, Brian's a good guy. He would never say anything, but I'm sure he wouldn't enjoy sleeping on the floor for five more days. He's gonna start to resent it, which will make him resent you. If you get him his own room, that won't happen. Besides, if something does happen, you could get a bit of privacy away from your annoying roommate." I said with a smile. She contemplated what I told her. She turned to the desk guy and made a decision. 

 "Can we get two rooms please?" 

 *********** 

 (Mary) 

 Brian said we didn't have to do it, but I can tell he appreciated the gesture of giving him his own room. Our rooms were connected, so we had the doors between them open as we unloaded the car for our stay. Jenna was extremely excited as we finally finished unloading the car. She turned to us. 

 "Guys, we should totally go to the beach." She suggested. 

 "I don't know." I started. 

 "C'mon, Mary. Don't be a wet blanket. Besides, the beach is like a mile away. We deserve a little relaxation after that drive." Jenna added. I looked at Brian, and he shrugged. 

 "Okay. Fine. Let's do it." I said. 

 "Awesome!" Jenna said. She grabbed some clothes and went into the bathroom. I smiled at Brian as he went to his bathroom to change. Jenna emerged in a different tank top and her cutoffs. She actually got more dressed than she was for the trip to the beach. I got changed into my swimsuit then covered myself with a t-shirt and a skirt. Brian emerged in his trunks and a shirt. He looked cute as always. We grabbed some towels and set off. 

 We chatted as we walked through the nearby area towards the beach. The smell of salt water hit us first, letting us know we were close. We stepped onto the relatively quiet beach and set down our stuff. Brian took off his shirt. I disrobed down to my bikini. It was nothing too flashy. I could tell Brian didn't mind what he saw. Then Jenna took off her tank top. From under it emerged her awesome breasts, barely contained by her top. The front of it had patches that didn't cover a whole lot. It covered the nipples and the surrounding areas, but it exposed an almost indecent amount of flesh. She dropped her shorts and turned around. Half of her butt was hanging out of the bikini bottom. It wasn't a thong, but it still left a lot of her ass exposed. She smiled at us and looked around. She saw a couple of boys a little ways down the beach. 

 "I'll be back." She said with a knowing smirk, before scampering off down the beach towards the boys. I looked at Brian and rolled my eyes. 

 "Let's take a walk." I said to him. 

 "Sounds good." He replied. We turned and set out away from Jenna and the boys. We chit chat for a bit as we walked. This was exactly what I had been hoping for. A beautiful, romantic moment. It was dusk, so the sun was low in the sky. A beautiful sunset. There was a cool breeze and the sky was pink. An absolutely perfect evening. 

 "Let's stop here." He said after we had been walking for about ten minutes. He sat down, and I followed suit. We just sat down in silence and absorbed everything. Absorbed this perfect moment. I suddenly felt his arm reach around me and pull me into his side. Goose bumps appeared all over. I rested my head on his shoulder. We sat like this for a few minutes. I pulled my head up and looked at him. He turned to look at me. Our eyes met. Our faces moved towards each other. Our lips met. We kissed. Just a small peck, but it said volumes. My head fell back onto his shoulder. Inside, I'm jumping up and down in excitement. We kissed! And it felt so good. I had chills. 

 We must have sat there for a half hour. I wish it could have been forever. But eventually, I can see Jenna walking towards us. She must have jumped into the water, because she is soaked as she reached us. She saw us wrapped up together and smiled. 

 "Hey guys." She said. I once again have to admit how great looking she is. That bikini of hers highlighted her assets really well. With it now soaked, it clung to her body like a second skin. 

 "Get any numbers?" I asked. 

 "Uh, yeah, do you think they would turn me down?" she said with a know-it-all tone. 

 "Probably not." I told her. 

 "Well, I don't know about you guys, but I am starving. I think we should go out and get something to eat. Something nice, cause quite frankly, I'm tired of this fast food. It's messing with my figure." She said. I don't see a single flaw on her.  

 

 ****** The Trip ****** byTheTalkMan© "What do you think?" I asked Brian, trying to not act too stingy. 

 "I'm pretty hungry too." He replied. I smiled at him and nodded. We both stood and packed up. We went back to the hotel room to change, and then drove around till we found a nice Italian restaurant. We sat at a table, with me sitting next to Brian and Jenna sitting across from Brian. Luckily, she had changed into something more decent than what she had worn most of the day. She was wearing a tight black t-shirt and jeans. The waiter came up to take our orders. I ordered a pasta dish, and then Brian ordered a steak. Jenna ordered the same thing that Brian did. 

 The meal went well. We chatted like old friends throughout. When Brian went to the bathroom, Jenna and I had quick girl talk. She was super excited for me when I told her that we kissed. Brian was back quickly, and normal conversation resumed. 

 This was honestly the best night ever. Surrounded by friends, kissing the boy I was falling in love with. But quite frankly, it was so much to take in that by the time we got back to the hotel, I was exhausted. Brian retired to his room, as we got changed for bed. I fell asleep with a smile on my face. 

 *********** 

 (Jenna) 

 I waited till I knew Mary was asleep. It wasn't long till she was snoring. I heard the TV playing in Brian's room next door. I smiled, as I removed the sheets covering me. I had put back on the outfit I had worn in the car, my pink tank-top and black booty shorts. I could tell Brian really liked those. Tonight's the night. I stand up and quietly snuck out the door, stepping into the warm night air. I shut the door quietly and step over to Brian's room. I knocked softly. I heard footsteps as he approached. He opened the door, looking a little tired, but still gorgeous. 

 "Hey, what's up Jenna?" he asked. 

 "I'm having trouble falling asleep. I heard your TV on and thought we could hang out for a bit. Mary's already out." I asked, slightly pushing out my boobs, hoping to sway his decision. 

 "I don't know, Jen. I was actually about to go to bed." he replied. 

 "Please, Brian? It'll only be for a little bit, until I get tired." I told him. Well, it might not be a little bit. It'll probably take a lot of fucking to wear me out tonight. 

 "Alright, I guess so." he relented. I stepped in. I pattered over in my bare feet and sat on the edge of the bed. I could smell his manly scent permeating through the room. He sat down a foot or two away from me. We sat in silence for a few minutes. I finally decided to start up my plan. 

 "So, I heard you two kissed earlier?" I asked him, looking right at him, reading his reactions. 

 "Uh, yeah, we did." he stammered, caught a little off guard. 

 "She really likes you, you know." I told him. 

 "Uh, really?" he asked, looking for confirmation of his own feelings. 

 "Yeah, she does. Trust me. I've heard a lot about you since before this trip started." I told him. 

 "Oh yeah?" he replied, happy to know the girl he liked actually liked him back. 

 

 "She wanted you to go on this trip with her since the start." I said. 

 "Really?" he asked, with a smile. 

 "Yeah. It's all quite adorable." I answered with a laugh. He laughed. 

 "So, you like her too, right?" I asked. 

 "Yeah, I like her." he replied. 

 "I thought so. I'm good at reading these kinds of things." I told him. There was a lull in the conversation as this all sunk in. 

 "But, I wanted to talk to you about something before your relationship with her goes any further." I started. 

 "What is it?" he asked. 

 "I've noticed this tension between us." I said. 

 "What kind of tension?" he asked. 

 "You've never met a girl like me, have you?" I asked. 

 "What do you mean?" he asked. 

 "A girl so experienced." I explained, trying to put it delicately. 

 "Experienced in what?" he replied, naively. I giggle at his innocence. 

 "Honey, you've never been around a girl like me who's been with quite a few men." I told him. 

 "Oh." He said, finally clicking into what I was saying. "Well, I guess not. I guess girls like you and guys like me run in different circles." he added. 

 "Exactly. Brian, can I ask you something?" I started. 

 "Yeah." he said, a little nervously. 

 "Are you a virgin?" I asked. He blushed. "Brian, it's nothing to be ashamed of." I said, grabbing his shoulder. He smiled to himself. I can tell that he's thinking that I already know the answer, so he shrugged and started to talk again. 

 "Uh, yeah, I am a virgin. I've just been waiting for the right girl to come along." he explained. I smiled. 

 "That's great. That's a great thing to do, Brian. But, this kinda relates to what I wanted to talk about." I said. 

 "Which is?" he asked. 

 "Like I said, you've never been around a girl like me. An innocent guy like you has to be fascinated with a girl like me, because I'm so unlike you." I explained. 

 "What makes you think that?" he asked. 

 "Brian, you have not been able to keep your eyes off of me this entire trip." I replied. 

 "I um, I, uh, no I didn't." he stammered, blushing again. I put my hand on his shoulder to soothe him. He pulled away and stood up. I did the same. 

 "Listen, Brian, nobody would blame you. I have been kinda showing off." I explained. He couldn't help but give me the up and down with his eyes. 

 "I really should apologize. I just can't help myself. I like to dress like a slut. I should've known how it would affect you." I told him. 

 "What do you mean, affect me?" he asked. 

 "You think a girl like me wouldn't notice that bulge in your pants whenever you looked at me." I told him softly with a smile. 

 "Uh, I don't know what you're talking about." he said, clearly terrified of me. 

 

 "Yeah you do. It'd be impossible not to notice me. It's impossible for a guy like you to not notice a slut like me." I told him. He smiled nervously and rubbed his eyes. 

 "I've never heard a girl call herself a slut." he replied. 

 "I'm not ashamed of it. I like sex. I've had a lot of sex, with a lot of guys. I've gotten very good at it. I can't hide my true nature." I told him. 

 "Why are you telling me this?" he said. 

 "You've known this since you met me. You knew I was a slut the second you saw me. You could smell it. An innocent guy like you can't control yourself around a girl like me, who just flaunts it, who struts her stuff. You can't help but react to me, on a purely physical level." I told him in a purr. I think he's starting to understand my true intentions. 

 "I mean, look at me. I've got nice, big boobs, smooth tan skin, sexy black hair and a nice round ass." I pause and turn around, letting him admire my juicy ass. I turn back. "It's impossible for any guy to not notice these things, let alone a guy like you." 

 "What are you doing? I like Mary." he told me, terrified. 

 "I know you do. But on a purely physical level, you like me more. I've got a better body than she does, and you know it." I said. 

 "So what if you have a better body? I still like Mary more." he replied, unwittingly confirming my statement. 

 "That's exactly my point. While you do like Mary, and clearly want to be with her, that might not be the best thing to do right now. Let me tell you something. I've been with a few virgins in my day. And to be honest, they were terrible. They were clumsy, awkward and they didn't last more than a minute. They wouldn't admit that they had a lot to learn. They wouldn't admit they were virgins. I didn't realize they needed the beginner course, when I was trying to give them the expert level stuff. And you know what the first thing I did when they finished. I kicked them out. Bad sex can ruin a relationship. And if you go into a relationship with Mary, the sex you two have will be pretty bad. You guys will be great together, you will. But if you go into a relationship with her and offer the pathetic sex that virgin's offer, that could end things. No girl wants to have sex with a virgin. She'll expect more than that. If you don't give her what she needs that could be the end of a great relationship. And that would be tragic." I said. I could not believe the bullshit I was spouting, but the best part was that he was too naïve to realize it. He was stunned into silence. 

 "So here's the point I'm been trying to get to. Virgins suck in bed. I know it, and you probably realize that I'm telling the truth here. But like I said earlier, the virgins I've been with were too proud to admit it. They were too proud to admit they had a lot to learn. But you? You're a good student, a good boy. You would admit you have a lot to learn. I think I could make something out of you with a little tutelage. I could teach you so much." I continued. He was taken aback. 

 "Are you saying what I think you're saying?" he asked. 

 "Yeah, I am. I am offering you a gift here. I can teach you so much about sex. It won't just be me telling you what to do. I'll be showing you. I teach by doing. I'll show you how to have sex using my body." I offered. 

 "You're saying, you want me to have sex with you." he asked, taking it all in. 

 "Yes. You won't learn to fuck without experience. I can give you that experience. I'm really good at sex. Like, spectacular at it. Your first time should not be with someone that you are really in to. Everyone's first time is bad. You don't want to ruin a good thing with her by having bad sex. I know you don't like me in the same you like her, but admit it, there's a part of you that's interested in a girl like me. You may not like me like a boy likes a girl, but you are attracted to me. In a purely physical way. You like my body. You're attracted to my body. You want to do bad things to my body. If you don't get this out of your system now, you might cheat on her later. And nobody wants that. So that's what I'm offering: guilt free, no strings attached, sex. I can teach you everything, and I mean everything, you need to know so that when you and Mary eventually have sex, you won't let her down." I said. I have to keep from smiling as I see him considering this option. 

 "I can't do this. I'm in to Mary." he said, his conscience flaring up. 

 "You're not cheating on her. You aren't official. I'll teach you all about fucking girls, and I'll leave you fully prepared and ready for a long, healthy relationship with Mary. I'm not trying to get in the way of you two here." I explained. I know this is bullshit, because once he's inside me, once he felt my tight pussy around his cock, there's no going back. 

 "I don't know." he said, with clearly conflicting emotions. 

 "Listen, Brian. We both know you want this. Mary will never know. I want to teach you to be a good lover, for her. I want to train you to make her happy. Don't you want to make Mary happy?" I asked. He's fighting a losing battle. I stood just in front of him, turned around, and pushed my ass into his crotch. I felt his hard cock fit perfectly between my ass cheeks. He groaned then backed away. 

 "No. I can't. I'm supposed to lose my virginity to someone I love, not a one night stand." he said, terrified to lose his virginity to a slut. I turned to face him. 

 "Brian, if everything were perfect, everyone's first time would just be awesome sex with their soul mates on their wedding nights. But, this is the real world. It takes practice to get good at this stuff. And believe me, I've had a lot of practice." I replied. I reached my arms around his shoulders and looked at him. As we looked into each other's eyes, I saw his will to resist fading. I turned around and pushed my ass back into his crotch. His hard cock returned to the area between my two firm ass cheeks. I started to roll my hips, grinding my ass against his dick. I grabbed his hands and put them on my hips. The slow grind of lust began in him. 

 "You have to start slow." I whispered. "You don't just dive in. With dancing, maybe some slow grinding. Really trying to get her going. Letting her know that you're interested in what she's offering." I said, flexing my ass cheeks around his hard cock. He groaned again. His hands start to rise along my sides, his goal obvious. I grabbed them and place them back on my hips. 

 "Slow baby, slow. You have to be patient. You have to let it build up. It's so much better that way." I whispered again. We stood there, grinding together for five or so minutes. He looked down at me over my shoulder, his eyes drawn into the valley between my massive breasts. My nipples were standing tall under my tank top. I tried to step away, but he held me against his dick, not wanting to lose the pleasurable feelings I was generating. I escaped his grasp, turned around and pushed him back till he fell to a sitting position on the bed. I straddled him, facing forward, so I'm now sitting on his lap. My arms went around his neck again. We stared into each other's eyes as I started to grind into him again. I pulled his face to mine, and before he knew it, my tongue was down his throat. He was in a daze as he just took my tongue, not fighting back. His tongue finally started to play with mine, and within minutes, his tongue was buried in my mouth. He was learning quickly. I wanted to emphasize what he got with me in comparison with a girl like her. With her, he got a little peck on a romantic beach. With me, he got deep french-kissing and grinding in a hotel room. There was clearly no comparison which was more memorable. 

 After kissing for a long time, showing him how sluts kiss, I pulled away and fell to my knees in front of him. He didn't fight me as I reached towards the top of his shorts and started to pull them down. The root of his massive cock started to appear. I pulled on the shorts until his incredible ten inch dick appeared, bouncing out of his shorts. I dropped his shorts to the ground. 

 "Oh, Brian. How no slutty girl has snatched this dick up, I'll never know. You've been waving this thing at all the sluts around and you've been able to resist them all. That's impressive." I said. I reached up with both hands and started to slowly stroke his dick, pre-cum already leaking from the head. 

 "Now most girls would go as fast as possible, trying to get you off quick. But true sluts know that they should take it nice and slow, letting it build to a head. Drive you to the edge, but not quite over." I said. I continue to jack his dick for awhile, keeping him on edge. 

 "I'm so sorry for teasing you all this time with my hot body. It must've been so hard to just sit there while there was a horny slut in the backseat begging to be fucked. Let me apologize." I said, before burying his dick in my mouth. 

 "Oh, god!" he moaned loudly. I went up and down, using my perfected blow-job technique. My tongue runs all over his dick. I use a lot of spit, so drool leaked all over his dick as I sucked. My drool drips down to his balls. I took as much as I could in my mouth, then took it out. I ran my tongue along the line of drool before taking his balls into my mouth, one at a time. I give his dick a kiss right on the head before pulling away, and returning to stroking his dick. 

 "I must say Brian. I have never seen a bigger dick in my life. I can't believe it's been wasted for so long." I told him. He was in a daze, incapable of forming a coherent thought. I stood up and pulled off his shirt. I pushed him back. 

 "A guy like you, with a dick that big, should be getting laid constantly. Not wasting it on your vows of virginity. Now, I'm gonna show you what you've been missing." I told him. I reached down to the bottom of my tank top and started to pull it off. I stopped just below my breasts. His eyes were on them, waiting for them to appear. I finally yanked my top up and off as my tits jiggle before coming to a stop, fully bared to his leering eyes. He couldn't take his eyes off my perfect 36 DD's. They were massive and perfect. They were perky and perfectly round. My nipples were constantly hard, and the areolas around them were nice and smooth. I loved my tits, and clearly, so did he. 

 I let him take this in for a few minutes before running my thumbs under the edge of my spandex shorts. I turned around, bent over slightly, and lowered them, revealing my perfect ass to him. My cheeks were firm, round, and tan. Usually, when a guy saw them, he couldn't resist the edge to constantly grab them. I dropped my shorts to the floor. I turned around to face him, hands on my hips, revealing to him my bare pussy, completely shaved. He didn't know where to stare, so he constantly shifted from staring at my tits to staring at my pussy. I jumped onto the bed and crawled over his naked body, his dick standing proudly. I reached between us and grabbed his dick, placing it at the entrance to my pussy. I leaned over him and stared into his eyes. 

 "Do I need, like, a condom or something?" he asked. 

 "Don't worry Brian. You have nothing to worry about." I told him. With that, I lowered myself onto him. His massive dick forced his way into my tight little pussy. We both moaned out loud. His dick felt so fucking good! I couldn't imagine the feelings going through his head. I've been told I have the tightest pussy around. I've fucked around, but I was still able to keep it nice and snug. And now, with him, a virgin, sticking his massive dick into my impossibly tight pussy, he must be feeling things he never knew existed. 

 My eyes looked back into his eyes as his settled back into mine. In that moment, our eyes said everything. In that moment, he realized that I was tricking him, that this had nothing to do with teaching him. In that moment, he knew this had nothing to with Mary. In that moment, he knew I was doing this just to get fucked. In that moment, he saw me for what I am: a horny slut that wanted his big dick. In that moment, he knew that my pussy was better than anything any other girl could offer. In that moment, he knew he could never get this from Mary. In that moment, his eyes filled with hate as he saw my plan, my plan to steal him from Mary. That moment passed quickly. 

 "You know what to do, Brian. Follow your instincts. Fuck me hard!" I commanded him. He looked up at me as I leaned up. He couldn't resist his most basic of urges. He grabbed my hips and started to slowly drive his dick into me. It started slow, but as I matched his rhythm, the fuck started to get harder. Our skin slapped together, as we both worked up a sweat. His eyes were transfixed by my bouncing tits. He looked up into my eyes and I nodded. His hands moved up to my breasts and he cupped them in his hands. 

 "Oh my god!" he said in disbelief as he finally has the tits he has been craving for so long in his hands. He squeezed them over and over. His fingers reached my nipples and he pinched them both, hard. 

 "Oh, fuck!" I yelled out. "You have a dirty side!" I said with a laugh, looking down at my fuck partner. He would never have done that with Mary. He had too much respect for her to do that. But he knew I was a slut, who'll take anything he wanted to do. He knew that I have no limits when I fuck. He's getting good. I knew he wasn't going to last long, since it was his first time. I sensed his worry as he nearly reached that point. 

 "You should get off me. It's gonna happen soon." he said to me. 

 "What's gonna happen?" I asked naively, continuing to bounce. 

 "I'm gonna cum. You have to get off of me." he pleaded. His hands go to my hips, attempting to lift me off. 

 "It's okay baby. You can cum in me. You have nothing to worry about." I replied. 

 "But you could get pregnant." he said, worried. 

 "So? Doesn't that make it better? Cumming inside some slut you barely know, with a good chance of getting her pregnant? That big dick of yours is built to get sluts pregnant. Sluts like me." I told him, letting my dark designs reach the surface for a moment. He tried to push me off of him again, but I fought him off and started to hump him harder. My ass flexing as I humped and grinded on that fat dick of his. His hands stopped fighting me, the pleasure too great. His arms fell back to my hips as he assisted me in making this fuck harder, helping in our mating rhythm, his base instincts reaching the surface. The instinct to fuck and impregnate the hottest bitch around. Me. I felt the orgasm I've been waiting for reaching the surface.  

 

 ****** The Trip ****** byTheTalkMan© "Oh, OH, OH FUCK! FUCK ME YOU FUCK! FUCKING CUM INSIDE ME! DO IT! OHHHHH!" I yelled out, cumming hard, the bed rocking. 

 "I'm gonna cum! I'm gonna cum! OH FUCK YES!" he called out, unable to hold it in. He pulled me down on his dick, burying his dick inside me before finally releasing all that nice sticky cum that had built up in his balls for days deep inside my wet pussy. He kept humping, trying to bury his dick even more inside me, trying desperately to get me pregnant. Mary was no doubt still asleep as the bed next door rocked with the hard fuck that just occurred. 

 I collapsed on top of Brian as I tried to catch my breath. He was speechless below me. This was one of the best fucks I had ever had. This virgin had given me a great fuck. Well, he was no longer a virgin. I had made a man out of him. I could feel the load he had given me deep inside me. His dick had softened, but it still felt huge inside of me. My weakened state allowed him to push me off of him onto the bed next to me. He sat up on the bed and put his head in his hands, clearly conflicted by what had just occurred. 

 "You should go." he said, feeling guilty. I could easily keep going, but I could be patient. It would take time for him to come to terms with what had just happened. The dark side of his nature was starting to reach the surface. The dark side I had instilled in him during our nasty fuck. The things I had said and done would resonate inside him. He would compare all of his fucks to this one, and they would all come up short. The things we had done, the things that had made him cum so hard, were now in his subconscious. He was a different man now that we had fucked. I think he expected more of a fight, but I bounced up and grabbed my clothes. 

 "That was just what I needed." I said. He was barely paying attention. 

 "Listen, Bri." I started, feeling a little informal with him now that we had fucked. I pulled on my tank top. "I'm gonna play sick tomorrow, food poisoning. I don't want to go to that stupid build thing." I said. He looked at me like the evil slut I am. I turned and started to pull on my shorts. "If you play sick tomorrow too, I can teach you some more. If you lie to Mary, and stay here with me." I started, and pulled up my shorts just below my ass. "If you do that, I'll let you fuck my ass." His eyes widened as I told him this. I slipped out his room with a smile on my face, and stepped into my hotel room. Mary was still asleep, of course. I slipped into my bed, and fell asleep with a smile on my face. 

 *********** 

 (Mary) 

 I woke up early, eager to get to the build. I got showered and changed into some work clothes. Jenna was starting to stir. She sat up and put her hands into her hands. 

 "Are you okay?" I asked. 

 "I don't feel good." She said. 

 "Oh, c'mon. You'll be doing some good work. Don't flake out on me." I said to her, annoyed. I knew she would do this. Try to get out of doing work by acting sick. 

 "Seriously, I don't feel good." she said, looking a little dazed as she looks at me. She looked a little sweaty. 

 "I knew you would do this, Jen. If I left you here, the second I leave you would be bouncing around, going shopping, or whatever." I said to her. 

 "You think I'm lying?" she said, clearly angry at me for presuming this. 

 "Yeah, I do." I told her. 

 "I got like food poisoning or something." Jenna said. 

 "Oh, yeah, food poisoning? Well, you had the same thing for dinner as Brian did. And he isn't sick." I explained. 

 "How do you fucking know? You haven't seen him." Jenna said. I marched over to the doors connecting our rooms. I opened the door on our side and knock on his. A few seconds later, Brian opened the door. I could tell immediately that something's wrong. He looks tired and pale. 

 "Are you okay?" I asked, worried. After yesterday, I wanted nothing more than to spend time with him, working together, doing some real good. 

 "I don't know. Something I ate isn't agreeing with me." he said. 

 "You think you'll be able to make it to the build?" I asked, hopeful that he would. 

 "I don't know. I was up half the night. I don't think it's getting any better." he replied. I was crushed. 

 "Uh, Jenna's feeling sick too. The meat at the restaurant must have been bad." I said. "I can stay with you guys. Make sure you guys are okay." I suggested. 

 "No, that's okay. You go to the build. You help them out. I'll be okay here." he said. 

 "You sure?" I asked. 

 "Yeah. I'll be fine. I'll be fine by tomorrow. I promise. If I need anything, I'll call you." he said. I looked over at Jenna. 

 "I'm sorry for thinking you were lying." I told her. 

 "It's okay." she said with a weak smile. 

 "Well, okay. I guess I'll head out. You guys sure you're okay here?" I asked. They both said they'd be fine. 

 "Well, I'll see you guys later." I told them. I stepped out of the hotel room. I am bummed out that neither of them will be there with me, but I am a little happy that I will be helping the underprivileged. I love to help. 

 *********** 

 (Jenna) 

 I had to stop myself from smiling when Brian lied to Mary. I knew I had him then. I never told him the addictive qualities of fucking sluts. He was mine the second he was balls deep in my tight pussy, just like I knew he would be. The second a young man sticks his dick into a tight, slutty pussy, he's addicted forever. You don't just fuck a slut once then walk away. Maybe he should have known this before deciding to fuck me. 

 I waited for Mary to be gone for a few minutes before bouncing over to Brian's room, through the connecting door he oh so courteously left open. 

 "Morning, lover." I said seductively to him. He looked at me with hate in his eyes, angry at what I had done to him. 

 "Who are you? I mean, what kind of person are you, to do this to me? To her?" he asked. He now started to understand his new addiction. That desperate need to empty his balls. He couldn't deny it. That's why I knew he would stay here with me. 

 "I'm just a slut, baby. A whore. A bitch. I'm a girl that likes to be fucked. Hard. And you Brian, you're the perfect man for a girl like me. I showed you what type of man you really are. You thought you were the type of guy to date sweet girls, go on nice little dates, and make love on your wedding night to your soul mate. But you're not. You have a big cock, perfect for a slut like me. Guys with big cocks need to get fucked on a daily basis. You know girls like her can't take care of you. Only a slut like me can take care of that fat cock of yours." I told him. He was stunned into silence. I continued. 

 "You already made your choice. You already fucked me. You already lied to her. Once a man gets fucked, that's a feeling that he just can't let go. You can't recreate that with your hand. You can't recreate that with most girls. Girls like Mary want to make love to you. Make love to your cock. That's not enough for you now. You need to get fucked now, on a constant basis. Your cock will accept nothing less. You think you can go back to her now after sampling what I have to offer? You think you can go back to her after playing with my huge tits. You think you will be satisfied with her after getting your dick sucked by me? I bet that, even though she's a virgin, my pussy is still tighter. Did she ever make you cock hard like I did when you first saw me? Does she ever cause your balls to fill with cum, to make your balls so swollen, desperate for release, like I did?" I said, stepping towards him as he stood in place. "Can she make you cum as hard as I did? " 

 I stepped up till I am pressed against his chest, my firm tits pressed against his chest. No doubt he felt my hard nipples against him. I looked up at him with a smile. I leaned up and softly pressed my lips against his. 

 ********** 

 (Mary) 

 I had checked in with the organizers of the build. They were surprised that I was the only person here from my group, but I explained to them the situation. Everyone was nice, but I felt kinda left out at times, simply because I didn't really know anyone. But it was fun, though. 

 As the morning sun rose in the sky and it started to get hot, the work got harder. To distract myself from the heat, I thought about Brian. We were practically dating. We had kissed. He kissed me! I liked him and he liked me. This thought drove me. I hoped he'd feel better. Maybe I could buy him some soup or something, anything to make him feel better. I knew he wanted to get out here and help out the underprivileged. I vowed tonight to do anything it took to make him feel good. 

 ********** 

 (Jenna) 

 I was bent over on all fours on the bed as Brian, on his knees behind me, positioned his hard dick against my asshole. I had thoroughly coated his dick with baby oil before bending over in front of him. 

 "Okay, Brian, just push slowly." I guided him. He complied, like a good lover would. He pushed until his cockhead pushed its way into my ass. 

 "Oh, shit!" he said, taking in the feeling of my tight ass. He kept pushing, forcing his cock deeper. I moaned out, in a little pain, but mostly pleasure. I love getting fucked in the ass. I can't imagine how good it feels for a guy to put his cock up a girl's tight ass. That was what he was feeling now. He buried about eight inches of his huge dick up my tight ass before bottoming out, no more room for his massive dick up my tight little ass. He took in this feeling before starting to slide his dick out and back in. 

 "You think Mary would let you do this? You think you could get anything this good with her?" I looked back at him with a smirk. 

 "Fuck you, bitch!" he hissed at me, slapping my right ass cheek. I moaned out loud and nearly came. Turning this nice, sweet, good-hearted boy, into a cursing, rutting man was almost enough to make me cum. The fuck started to get harder as he drove his dick harder and harder into me, desperate to cum. He reached under me and cupped my tits, squeezing them hard as he could, as our orgasms quickly approached. 

 "Oh, FUCK! I'M CUMMING, YOU BASTARD. YOU'RE MAKING ME CUM!" I yelled out. My asshole clenched around his dick, inducing him to cum. 

 "AHH! FUCK!" he yelled out, his warm seed filling my asshole. Our mutual orgasm lasted about a minute, before he fell back and I fell forward onto my stomach. We both caught our breaths. I turned over to lie on my back. I started to rub my pussy. I was still really hot, really turned on. 

 "Brian, come up here. I need more." I pleaded with him, directing him to my pussy. He looked scared. This was clearly something he has never done before. I wiggled my finger, directing him to get closer. He moved closer till his face was within a foot of my pussy. My nice, wet, bare pussy. He licked his lips. I grabbed his head and pulled him forward, his mouth mashing against my cunt. 

 ********** 

 (Mary) 

 I had just left the build as work ended for the day. I decided to pick up some soup for them both, hoping that it would help them feel better. I felt bad that they were cooped up in the hotel all day while I got to be out in the sun. They probably were stuck in bed all day. 

 ********** 

 (Jenna) 

 The shower sprayed water down on us both as Brian pinned me against the shower wall. My legs were around his waist as he drove his dick into my pussy. His mouth and hands were busy with my breasts, squeezing them and forcing my nipples into his sucking mouth. 

 I had taken advantage of that mouth of his hours earlier. I kept his mouth on my pussy for over an hour, wanting him to get well acquainted with it. He licked and sucked on me. He nibbled and sucked on my clit. After a series of excellent orgasms, he knew my pussy as well as I did. I pulled him up to me and we rested for a few hours, regaining our strength. 

 We had woken up and decided to take a shower to clean up. He was now voraciously sucking on my nipples, biting and chewing on them. We humped together at a furious pace. He was getting tired, so he set me down and pushed me forward against the glass. He stood behind me and pushed his dick back into my pussy, back where it belonged. He banged me from behind as my tits pressed against the glass. After a few minutes of this, he buried his dick and released another load deep inside me.

 (Mary) 

 I returned to the room to find Jenna walking bowlegged to her bed. 

 "What's wrong?" I asked her. 

 "I've been heaving all day. My back is throbbing." she told me, falling to her bed. I noticed the door between the rooms open and I walked through to find Brian lying back on the bed, looking exhausted. 

 "Hey. How you feeling?" I asked him. 

 "Uh, hey. I'm beat." he replied. 

 "Feeling any better?" I asked hopefully. 

 "Yeah, a little bit." he said. 

 "You think you'll be up for the build tomorrow." I asked 

 "Yeah, I think so." he replied. 

 "I got you guys some soup." I said, pulling out the cans of soup I had bought. 

 "Cool. I'm starving." he said, sitting up. I microwaved the soup then brought it over to him. He started to eat it. 

 "So, how was your day here?" I asked. 

 "Well, we were either in the bathroom or in bed for most of it. So, yeah, that's pretty much it. How was the build?" he asked. 

 "It was good. Everyone was really nice. It went really well. Didn't get to talk too much. Had no one to talk too." I said to him. He smiled. 

 "Sorry about that." he said with a small smile. 

 "It's okay." I replied. Jenna joined us in Brian's room. 

 "I got you some soup." I told her. 

 "Cool." she replied. We chatted for awhile, eating, and having a fun conversation. They were both pretty beat, so we called it an early night. 

 The next morning, Brian toughed it out and decided to join me at the build. Jenna still wasn't feeling good, so she hung back at the hotel. I drove to the build as we chatted for a bit. 

 "So, have you thought about getting the AC fixed?" he asked. 

 "Well, we don't have the money for it." I replied. 

 "I'm not saying to use the stipend money. I'm saying just pay for it with your own money. You'd have to do it eventually anyway." he replied. 

 "I don't know." I replied. 

 "Well, I know Jenna would appreciate it. And I'm not gonna lie. I am not looking forward to dealing with that drive again with no AC." he said laughing. 

 "Okay, maybe I will. Maybe tomorrow, we can take a cab down to the build, and let Jenna take the car to the shop. I'll give her some of my money. Cause I get the impression she doesn't really want to go the build. It'll give her something to do." I told him. He smiled at my last comment. 

 We reached the build soon after and got to work. We worked together, and it was fun. We flirted a little bit back and forth. We worked hard, and the sun rose high in the sky. I could tell the heat was getting to him. He was carrying some supplies when I saw him pause and take a deep breath. 

 "Are you okay?" I said, coming up to him and putting my hand on his shoulder. He looked at me, and it seemed like he came to a conclusion. 

 "The heats getting to me. I'm thinking maybe I rushed it coming back today." He said. I frowned. 

 "Are you sure?" I asked. "You should drink some water." I added, handing him my water bottle. He drank it, then shook his head. 

 "It's not that I'm dehydrated. It's my stomach, kicking in again." he said. 

 "Do you think you should go back to the hotel room?" I asked. 

 "That might be for the best." he replied sadly. 

 "Well, how are we going to do this?" I asked. 

 "I tell you what. You stay here, and keep helping. I'll drive back to the hotel, then I'll come back and pick you up." he said to me. 

 "Oh, okay. You sure you don't want me to drive you?" I asked. 

 "No, it's okay. You stay and help." he replied. I walked over and gave him a hug. 

 "I hope you feel better." I told him. 

 "Me too." he replied. I watched him walk over to the car and drive off. I was disappointed that I was alone again, so I went back to work to get my mind off of it. 

 *********** 

 (Jenna) 

 I was staring into the mirror, applying some make up. I had changed into a dark blue tank top and my tight, denim, booty shorts. I heard the door to the room open and close and I smiled to myself. I heard the connecting door opened, and I saw Brian behind me in the mirror. He walked up behind me, put his arms around my waist, and started to grind his hard dick between my ass cheeks. He started to kiss my neck as his hands started to lift my shirt. 

 "I couldn't stop thinking about you." he said, between sucks and licks on my neck. His hands lifted my top up to my shoulders, revealing my bare breasts. His hands immediately jumped up to them and started to squeeze. One of his hands slid down my stomach, slipped under my shorts, and started to finger my pussy. 

 "Couldn't stay away, could you? You saw her, pathetic, fat little body moving around and realized it didn't compare to mine." I said huskily. His mouth lifted off my neck. 

 "This has nothing to do with her. Stop talking about her." he said angrily, resuming his sucking on my neck, fingering me harder. 

 "Yes it does. This has everything to do with her. You think you love her, but you keep coming back to me. You can't get enough of my hot body. I think you found something you love more than her." I said. He lifted me up, carried me to my bed, and threw me down. 

 "I don't love you. I don't love your body." he said, clearly in denial. He took off his shirt and started to unbutton his pants. I pulled my tank top off and slipped out of my shorts, presenting my nude form once again to him. He took off his pants and boxers quickly, and joined me on the bed. 

 "Yes you do. It must be love if you can't stop yourself from forcing your huge dick into my tight little pussy on a daily basis. It must be love if you chose to abandon lovely Mary to spend more quality time with me. I dare you to stop fucking me. I don't think you can do it. I don't think you care about Mary at all anymore, do you?" I said, taunting him. 

 "Fuck you!" he hissed, placing his dick at the entrance to my pussy. I wrapped my legs around him and pulled him inside me. He groaned out loud, his dick now back home. He started to raise and lower his hips, starting another lewd fuck. 

 We fucked for a few hours before he had to go and pick up Mary. Things got boring again once Mary showed up, and we were forced to spend the rest of the night making inane chit-chat. She made plans for me tomorrow to take her car into the shop. I was fine with it, as long we had air conditioning on the drive home, I would be happy. 

 Brian played sick again, clearly now feeling the addictive affects of fucking sluts. Mary was disappointed again, but who cares. Five minutes after she was out the door, Brian's hard dick was buried up my tight asshole. We spent the next hour or so fucking hard, taking the edge off, knowing we had a long day ahead of us. We drove the car to the shop, and waited around a few hours while they fixed the AC. Brian used Mary's credit card to pay, but finally, after a week of waiting, we had a fully functional AC in Mary's crappy little car. Brian sat down in the driver's seat while I sat in the passenger seat. 

 "Hey, so we have Mary's credit card. Why don't we go do a little shopping?" I said with a wide smile. 

 "No, we can't do that, that's horrible. Besides, I'm pretty sure she would figure out what happened." Brian said incredulously. I nodded in agreement. I noticed something between the seats and grabbed it. It was the envelope holding the stipend money. 

 "Hey, give that back!" he said, reaching over to try and grab it from me. I held it out of his reach. 

 "Hold on, hold on. I'll make you a deal." I said. He calmed down and started to listen. 

 "Now, I have taught you so much. I have brought you from the beginner level stuff to the expert stuff. I have brought you so much pleasure. I think I deserve a little reward." I told him, unzipping the envelope.  

 

 ****** The Trip ****** byTheTalkMan© "Doesn't that make you a whore? Having sex for money?" he responded. 

 "I think it's all the fucking I do that makes me a whore." I responded with a smile. That shut him up. I started to leaf through the money. 

 "Now, I'll leave enough to cover the hotel rooms, and food and gas. That still leaves a bunch of extra money. Let's have a little fun. C'mon, you know I've earned it." I said with a sickeningly sweet smile. I pulled out a wad of cash. I saw his resolve fading. 

 "I don't know. It seems wrong." he said. 

 "Honey, you've done a whole lot of wrong on this trip." I told him. 

 That is how I earned myself a nice little shopping trip. Money that was meant to help the underprivileged went towards a better cause: making a little college slut's life a little better. Money that was meant to help build homes for the poor was now spent on buying me a bunch of sexy outfits. Money that was donated to help the sick bought me a lacy little bra to help push up my massive breasts. Money meant to feed the hungry was better spent on the sexy little thong tucked snugly between my ass cheeks. Money donated specifically to make the world a better place bought me the tramp stamp now freshly adorned on my lower back. Just the thought of all of this made me wet. How did Brian react to my shopping trip, you might ask? He could barely make it into my hotel room before burying his dick in my cunt. 

 It was the guilt over him letting me use this money for myself that weighed on him more than anything. I could tell he felt bad, so the next morning, our last full day in California, he decided to join Mary at the build and was actually able to stay there the entire day. It wasn't all of the cheating he had been doing on her that made him guilty. It wasn't that he would rather spend the day fucking my slutty ass than hanging with Mary, helping to build stupid houses. That didn't bother him enough to stop. No, it was a couple hundred bucks that did it. His priorities were all messed up, it seemed. The thought made me smile. 

 Being on my own for the day didn't bother me at all. Mary didn't even bother asking if I was going to come down to the build. She knew better. So, with the day to myself, I was able to go down to the beach and work on my tan. It gave me the chance to wear my teeny bikini that I had purchased the day before, and the guys at the beach were stumbling all over themselves at the sight of me. I gave them nothing to show I was interested. I gave them no indication that I even noticed them. All I cared about was that at the end of the day, my tan looked spectacular. 

 I beat them back to the room and got changed. My back was still sore from getting the tattoo, and I didn't want Mary to notice it, so I had to keep it covered. They came in a few minutes later, worn out from a long days work. We all started to pack up when Mary started looking through the stipend money. Brian looked at me nervously. 

 "This isn't right, we're missing some money." she said, looking at us. 

 "How much?" Brian asked. 

 "A few hundred bucks!" she said, worried. "How could this have happened?" Then she looked over at me. 

 "Jen, I have to ask. You didn't take anything out of here, did you?" she asked. 

 "No! Of course not!" I said, acting offended. "Besides, Brian had the money on him at all times." I added, shifting the blame to Brian. He looked shocked at this. 

 "I didn't take any." he stammered out. 

 "Well, I know that." Mary assured him. Bitch. Assuming I stole the money, and Brian was infallible. Ha, little does she know. 

 "Maybe I dropped some. When we got gas or something, and I was taking the money out. Maybe some of it fell out and I didn't notice." he explained, sounding sincere. I admired his ability to lie so easily to Mary. Mary thought to herself and then came to a conclusion. 

 "It's okay. Listen, they gave me the money, so it was my responsibility. If they raise any questions, I'll take the blame." Mary said. 

 "Mary, no..." Brian started, but Mary interrupted. 

 "No it's okay. I don't want you to get into trouble." she said. 

 "Mary, I lost it. I'll take responsibility." Brian argued. Ha! I had to stop myself from laughing watching these two argue about who was going to take responsibility for the money I stole. 

 "Listen, Brian. I have never met anyone as passionate about helping the underprivileged, about helping the poor, and the sick. I'm pretty passionate, but you're even more so. I don't want anything to get in the way of you helping. If I have to take the hit, I will." she argued. Brian smiled, grabbed her by the sides of her head, and pulled her into a kiss. No tongue, obviously, just a long, boring, closed-mouth on closed mouth, kiss. I rolled my eyes. They separated, and Mary was blushing. She was starting to tear up as she burst into a brilliant smile. She pulled him into a hug. She'd never looked happier. 

 She was bopping around the room the rest of the night, on cloud nine. We started to pack and load some of the stuff into the car. We called it an early night soon after. 

 We woke up way too early to get a start on the trip back. Brian went to check us out of the rooms, as Mary and I finished packing. When he returned and walked up to the driver's side door, I started the next phase of my plan. 

 "Shotgun!" I called out. 

 "What? C'mon Jen." She said, imploring me to change my mind. 

 "Hey, I rode in the back the whole way here. I'd like to see what the front seat is like." I argued, taking advantage of her good nature. That's why she will always be a loser, and I'll always be a winner. 

 "Fine." she relented angrily. She sat in the back seat as I sat in the passenger seat. I was wearing a cute pink blouse I had bought with some of my denim booty shorts. With my darker tan, I looked amazing. Brian sure noticed, his eyes consuming all the visual treats I was offering. Brian started the car, pulled out, and started the drive back home. 

 The drive back was far more fun than the drive to California. Late on the first day, Mary had fallen asleep in the backseat. The tension between Brian and me was thick. We were both visibly horny. Neither of us had had to go this long without fucking for like the last week or so, and we were feeling it. We were both fidgety, aching to find a release from this tension. That is why he put up no resistance whatsoever when I unzipped his pants, pulled out his throbbing, ten inch dick, and inhaled it down to his balls. It was so fucking hot to be sucking off Brian while Mary snored in the backseat, like, three feet away. I slobbered loudly on his dick, making this blowjob extra wet and juicy. He finally put his hand on my head, held me so his dick was completely buried in my throat, and came. He groaned quietly, trying as hard as he could to not vocalize the pleasure he was feeling and wake up Mary. I swallowed his load, like a good whore should. It was more than usual, having almost two days of cum built up. I tucked his deflating dick neatly back into his pants and zipped him up. I leaned back up into my seat and looked at him. He looked relaxed, the pressure in his balls now gone. 

 "Did you like your first bit of road head, baby?" I whispered. His look told the story. I think I drained all his energy out through his dick. I smiled. 

 "Listen, baby. Now you have to return the favor." I whispered to him. 

 "What? How?" he asked, looking at me incredulously, confused at the logistics involved in returning the favor. I giggled. I grabbed his hand. 

 "Here, baby, let me show you." I said, guiding his hand into my shorts until he understood. Two of his fingers slipped inside my pussy. I had taught him well. He was now an expert at fingering a girl. I sat back and rested my arms comfortably as I let him get to work. Within a few minutes he had me on edge. But he wouldn't take me over. He held me on the edge, forcing me to plead with him. 

 "Don't tease me, baby. Just make me cum." I begged to him. He started to finger me harder, pushing me to the edge. I finally grabbed onto his wrist as he pushed me over the edge. I held his hand between my legs as I rode the orgasm out. I finally released his hand, and he pulled it out of my pants. His hand appears to us both, now soaked. I pulled his hand to my mouth, and one at a time, sucked his fingers into my mouth, cleaning off my juices. He put his hand back on the wheel. I looked back in the rearview mirror and smiled as I saw Mary still peacefully asleep. I noticed Brian move his hand up to his nose every so often, trying to take in my scent off of his fingers. I don't even think he knew he was doing it. Mary woke up a few minutes later, and with that, the ride became boring again. 

 As we woke up the next morning and started to load the car, Mary made sure to immediately call shotgun. I smiled, but I knew that I probably wouldn't be able to have any fun today. And I was not wrong. This was as boring a day as I had had during the trip. We found another hotel room late that night, just one, which we all shared. Brian slept on the floor again, and I slept on the side of the bed next to him. Hours passed after we all went to bed, but I was still awake. I was too fucking horny to sleep. I looked down, and noticed that Brian was still awake too, no doubt going through what I was going through. Mary was of course, sound asleep. I looked at Brian until he noticed me. I pointed to the door, indicating we should go outside. He looked conflicted, but his aching balls forced his hand, and he stood up, ready to sneak outside. I grabbed the car keys quietly, and led him out of the room. I held his hand and led him to the backseat of the car. 

 We proceeded to work up quite a sweat in the backseat as I rode his hard cock to a screaming orgasm. After draining his balls deep in my pussy, I led him up quietly to our room. We were in for a shock as we entered and saw a confused Mary, wondering where we were. 

 "What's going on?" she asked. 

 "Neither of us could sleep, so we went out and got some air." I responded, thinking quickly. 

 "I could use some air." she suggested with a smile. We were forced to spend a half hour chit chatting with Mary on the balcony until we went back into the room. No longer horny, I was able to fall asleep quickly. 

 The next day was the last day of the trip. No more hotels, no more car rides after today. Mary almost catching us seemed to really spook Brian, so he barely spoke to me for the first half of the drive. Mary drove, Brian was in the passenger seat, and I was behind him in the back. We stopped halfway through the drive to get gas. Mary pumped the gas, and then we pulled over to the side because Mary wanted to go to the bathroom before moving on. As she did, she left me and Brian alone in the car. I reached around the seat and start to rub his chest and kiss his neck. He grabbed my hands and pushed me away. 

 "Stop, hey stop." he said to me. I sat back in my seat. 

 "What's wrong?" I asked. 

 "We can't do this anymore." he said to me. 

 "Why not?" I said with a little pout. 

 "This trip, you know, it's been a different world. What happens on the trip stays on the trip. You know, once the trip is over, we are over. I am going to move on with Mary." he explained to me. 

 "Are you breaking up with me?" I said to him with a bright smile. 

 "We never were together. We were never anything more than what we did. That's it. Once this trip is over, we won't be seeing each other again. And I plan to keep it that way. We're done, okay? That's it." he said, laying it all out for me, bracing for my wrath. 

 "Okay." I said with a smile. 

 "That's it?" he asked, confused by my lack of a fight. I snuck forward and grabbed his cell phone before he could stop me, and started to play with it. 

 "Yeah, Brian. If you want it to be over, it's over. If you think you can give this up and be with Mary, then go ahead. If you can go on without my big tits, which you just love to squeeze and play with, then go ahead. If you can go on without having my long smooth legs wrapped around you as we fuck, then do it. If you can give up my hot ass, which you love to love to bury your huge dick into, then go ahead. If you can go on without having my tight little pussy, that knows how to drain your balls in just the right way, then go ahead. If you want to be with plain old Mary rather than a hot slut like me, then I wish you luck. But, if you change your mind..." I started, before tossing his phone back to him. "Then give me a call. You have my number. If you ever get bored of what Mary has to offer, you know where to find me." I finished. 

 "After we get back, I'm never going to see you again." he said with an arrogant smile. 

 "If you say so." I replied, with a bright smile. He looked at me angrily at this, but Mary returned and ruined our fun. 

 The rest of the drive was quiet. We reached the dorms at nine thirty or so in the evening. We started to unpack. I dragged some of my stuff up to the dorm, leaving them alone. I went back down to grab one last thing, and I see them standing next to Brian's car, standing close. All Brian's bags were in his car. I listened to their conversation as I grabbed my bag. 

 "Hey, so, I'm thinking maybe we should meet up at some point over the break. Just hang out. I think it'll be fun." Mary said awkwardly, finally asking Brian out. 

 "I would like that." Brian responded with a smile. They moved towards each other and shared another cute little peck. They then hugged. Brian, looking over her shoulder, can now clearly see me. I held my thumb and pinky out in the style of a phone. I held my fingers between my mouth and ear, and with a smile, mouthed the word, "Call me." 

 He gave me a look as he continued the hug. I put on a smug smile as I turned and walked away. 

 *********** 

 (Mary) 

 I had finally asked out Brian at the end of the trip. I couldn't be happier when he told me he agreed to see me over the summer. I had dreams about our future together. Nice dates, long walks on the beach, seeing movies together, getting married. I could see all of this in our future. I would love to say it all worked out, and we lived happily ever after, but unfortunately, it was not meant to be. 

 We met up a few times over the summer. Our gentle pecks turned into longer, full on, french-kisses. The sexual tension was rising between us. I was surprised at how much Brian wanted to push our physical relationship to the next level. It made me happier to know that he couldn't control his hormones around me. I held out for a little bit, but one night, all alone at my house, I gave my virginity to him. We made love for the first time. 

 I would love to say it was world changing, that I saw stars afterward, but I didn't. It was, in a word, awkward. He moved a lot faster than I would have liked him too. He got me all warmed up very nicely, but when he positioned his large penis, tucked safely in a condom, at my vagina, I wanted him to go slow. I pleaded with him to be gentle. But he couldn't control himself. He pushed his penis into my vagina quickly, taking my virginity. I told him to slow down but he didn't listen. He was eager for the sex to begin. He didn't understand that I was in a bit of pain. He started to drive his penis into me at a fast pace. I told him to slow down again but he wasn't hearing me. He was in another world. He was an animal. I finally had to yell at him to get his attention. He gave a quick look, a look that was almost anger. He looked angry at me for stopping him. I gave him a shocked look. That look transferred to him, and he smiled at me and apologized. He slowed down into a nice rhythm, and we made love for about ten minutes before he finished. He went to sleep soon after, and I could sense he was a little disappointed. 

 I was crushed. I saw a side of him I never thought I would see. I saw a dark part of him. A beast, an animal. At that most personal, intimate moment, I think I saw his true colors. I started to think that maybe he wasn't the man I thought he was. 

 I felt he was a little more distant after that night. We would still meet up, and we made love again. He was gentler and more considerate, and our love making improved. I started to think at times that was his main goal whenever we met up, to have sex. That seemed to be his endgame every day we spent together. But these are the things I had to do to have a boyfriend, so I dealt with it. Besides that, it went okay, but he seemed like there was something he wasn't telling me. I tried to talk to him, but he wouldn't open up. As the school year approached, the distance between us seemed to grow. 

 It was at the end of the first week of school that we met up again. We met for lunch, and at the end, he told me he thought we should break up. I was crushed by this, and started to cry. He held my hand and told me we could still be friends. He told me that we were probably better friends than we were boyfriend and girlfriend. He joked around, and I saw that nice, cute side of him reappear. He calmed me down and assured me that we could still be friends, but he thought that things had just been kinda weird between us, so he thought it might be best to just bite the bullet and end it. We left on good terms, but I was still heartbroken. 

 I tried to reexamine our relationship and see where it went wrong. I came to this conclusion: We rushed the sex. We shouldn't have had sex that early in a relationship. A relationship where the sex starts so early is doomed to fail. Ever since that point, when we had sex, it just got weird. We didn't know each other well enough to really make the sex an amazing, life changing experience. I vowed to hold off on the sex as long as I could when I'm in another relationship. That would be how I would hold onto a man. 

 That wasn't the only piece of bad news I had. I met up with the girl in charge of the honors society. This was the first time I had been able to talk to her since the trip. She was not happy when I explained what happened with the stipend. A few bucks she could look past, but a few hundred. She told me she trusted me, but she could not just let this slide. She said it was suspicious that this money just disappeared. As much as she hated to do it, she told me I would owe them the lost cash, plus I would be no longer welcome in the society. I was sad at her ruling, but I understood. At least Brian would still be welcome; at least he would still be able to do some good. 

 As much as I tried to move on, I was still hung up on Brian big time. I still had feelings for him, but I knew that he might not share those same feelings for me. I did want him to be happy though. I was about to be tested with this big time. 

 It was a few months later, in early December, and I was in my apartment, alone. I heard my cell ringing and saw it was Jenna. She had surprisingly been a great friend to me during these past few months. She had provided me a lot of great girl talk and advice about relationships when I was with Brian. She was a better friend than I thought she ever would be. I picked up the phone. 

 "Hey, what's up?" I asked. 

 "Hey, Mare. I wanted to talk to you about something." she said, sounding out of breath. 

 "What is it? Hey, are you busy or something?" I asked. 

 "Yeah, just got back in from a run?" she said. 

 "Oh. So, what's up?" I asked. 

 "So, I wanted to talk to you before you heard it from someone else." she started. 

 "Heard what?" I asked. 

 "Well, I was at a party a few weeks ago, and I ran into Brian. We got to talking, and we started hanging out. Mary, me and Brian have started seeing each other." she told me, still breathing hard. I went numb. I couldn't believe it. Jenna was seeing Brian. My Brian? How dare she? In my silence, she continued. 

 "I'm sorry, Mary. I know it's messed up, because he's your ex. But I've been trying to, you know, have more adult relationships, and settle down a bit. It's been going really well. But, I wanted you to know. I wanted to see if you're okay with this. I wanted to get your approval. If you're not okay with this, then I'll break it off. I'll stop seeing him." she said.  

 

 ****** The Trip ****** byTheTalkMan© I didn't know what to do. How could that slut Jenna start seeing my ex? Who does that? But I had to stop thinking out of anger. If she was really trying to improve herself, then who am I to stop it? If she's happy, and Brian's happy, then who am I to get in the way? I had to let go of Brian. We were broken up, and he had moved on. I hated that he was seeing Jenna. I didn't understand what he saw in her. But, I had to be the bigger person. I had to move on. 

 "Okay. It's okay." I told her. Jenna groaned out loud. 

 "Are you okay?" I asked. 

 "Yeah, just a leg cramp, Mary. Anyway, are you sure? Are you sure it's okay?" she asked. 

 "It's okay. If you guys are happy, then I'm happy. You have my approval." I told her. I heard muffled noises as it sounded like she was covering the phone. 

 "Sorry, dropped the phone. Thanks, Mary. It means a lot for me that you're okay with this. Thanks for being, uh, cool about this." she said to me. 

 "Okay." I respond, in a daze. 

 "Listen, I gotta, uh, gotta go now. Okay bye!" she said quickly, ending the call. I set the phone down. I sat in the apartment, alone, not moving. Just silence. 

 *********** 

 (Jenna) 

 I had to get off the phone quickly. I didn't want Mary to hear me cum. 

 "Oh, fuck Brian, you fuck me so fucking hard. You're fucking making me cum!" I yelled at him, as he thrusted hard from behind me as I was bent over in front of him as we fucked doggy style. I came really fucking hard on his huge cock. He kept thrusting away, like the good lover I trained him to be. 

 I knew he would come crawling back to me. I knew that once he saw what Mary had to offer, he would come seek my companionship. It was on the first day back to college that he called me. He arrived at my doorstep, his rock hard dick evident in his shorts. He assumed he could just come in and just get down to business with me, but I held him off. I told him, in no uncertain terms, that he couldn't fuck my tight little cunt unless he dumped Mary. I was not going to share him with her. He reluctantly agreed. 

 Within a half hour of Brian dumping Mary, he was balls deep in my tight little snatch. From that point on, he was mine. We fucked constantly. Somehow, I didn't end up pregnant from all of our fucking during the trip, but I intended to change that. There was a part of him that might not want to stay with me. If he put a baby in my belly, he would be mine for good. 

 Brian stopped going to those stupid honors society meetings. He found a better cause: My tight pussy. It was his addiction. He did whatever I wanted as long as he could do me on a regular basis. All that energy and passion that he put towards helping the underprivileged was now used to make his spoiled little college slut cum. And he knew how to make me cum. He was an expert at it. 

 Brian slapping me on the ass brought me back to the present. I had made a real man out of him. A grunting, cursing, fucking man. 

 "I fucking told you Brian. I told you she would approve of us. What a fucking dumbass! What must it be like to so completely owned by another girl? She plans her little romantic moment, but she lets me come with. Of course I'm going to fuck you. And that fucking idiot doesn't notice a thing. Then, I steal her man from her, and she's okay with it! How fucking hot is that Brian? Ha!" I moaned out to him. 

 "So fucking hot, Jenna. Everything you've ever said is right. Your tight pussy feels so fucking good." he grunted to me, tracing his fingers along my tramp stamp. 

 "Come on baby, make me pregnant. Come on baby, do it. Fuck me! Do it! Make me fucking cum and give me a baby." I told him. He buried his dick in me and released his load into me as he made me cum as well. He collapsed onto my back, forcing us down to the bed. 

 "I love you" he whispered in my ear.

 I stood in the chapel and tried to remember how I got here. To be perfectly honest, I had trouble moving on from Brian. I couldn't stop thinking about him. I kept obsessing about his relationship with Jenna. How did that happen? Did something happen between them during the trip? I didn't remember anything. They were sick most of the time. Maybe they bonded or something. 

 I just kept thinking that if I hadn't brought her with us on the trip, then nothing would have happened between them, they wouldn't have ever known each other. If I hadn't have gotten drunk one night, I wouldn't have felt obligated to let her come with. It was my fault. 

 It was hard knowing they were so happy together. Brian wasn't happy with me, but was happy with her. She had something that I didn't, something that he liked more. That drove me nuts. We met a few times, as we were still friends. It was hard to see them so happy together, hanging off each other. It was hard to see pictures of them online, at parties, having the time of their lives, so happy. I was floored when I found out that he had proposed to her only after only a few months of dating. Come to find out, he had knocked her up. Unbelievable. He had truly moved on. 

 I had met another boy, Christopher. He was a sweetheart, not as big and strong and handsome as Brian, but good nonetheless. He treated me sweetly, and I held off on our lovemaking. He totally understood. He was kinda bland, but he was nice, and I didn't want to be single at that point. 

 So here I stood at Brian and Jenna's wedding. Jenna asked me to be her maid of honor. I didn't really want to do it, but I couldn't tell her no. Brian looked so gorgeous as he stood a few feet away, watching Jenna walk down the aisle. She was visibly pregnant, six months pregnant to be exact. His parents had insisted that he marry her before the baby comes. She still looked great though. She didn't even get big and bloated like some pregnant women do. She had one of those volleyball tummy's which looked like she had a volleyball stuffed in her shirt. 

 I watched conflicted as they said their I do's, insanely jealous of Jenna. She was so happy and so beautiful, and she had Brian locked down. She was set for life. I looked over at Christopher, and looked away, disappointed.

 (Jenna) 

 I was in the bathroom of my honeymoon suite. My husband was waiting for me in the bedroom. I looked at my topless body. I still looked damn good for a chick that was six-months pregnant. My boobs had already gotten bigger. Brian really liked that. 

 I had convinced Brian to start accepting his father's money. He had a wife and a baby to take care of. No more of that self-made man bullshit. Take the money, live the good life. His parents had paid for the wedding, and they bought us a house as a wedding gift. 

 Meanwhile, I was totally dropping out of school. I was set. I had gotten knocked up by a rich stud and gotten him to marry me. I was ready to live the good life. I didn't need to do any silly work. Let hubby do all the work and then let him come home to a nice tight cunt to fuck. That's all he'll ever need. 

 I walked into the bedroom, only wearing a white garter belt, nylons, and suspenders connecting the two. My husband Brian was laying on the bed, naked, his massive ten inch dick pointing straight up at the ceiling. His eyes feasted on my naked body. He had one thing to tell me. 

 "Jenna, you fucking slut. I fucking love you." 

 I joined him on the bed, victorious. Victorious over him and over Mary. I smiled as I lowered my pussy on his massive dick, and his hands reached up to cup my massive tits. I smiled. Life was good.

 (Author's note: I just wanted to say thanks for all the great feedback I have been getting. They have been mostly positive, and I've been very encouraged by them. This story ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated. I originally was going to have Mary find out Brian and Jenna were fucking, and be stuck with them as she flaunted her victory over her the whole drive back, but I decided to change it. I tried a few different things in this story, some I will keep doing, some not. Most of my criticisms I've received dealt with the changing POV's. I am still evolving as a writer, so I am trying to work on it, so bare with me. I have received a lot of comments from people willing me to keep writing these stories. I just want to say I have no plans to stop. Like I said in my profile, I am always looking for new ideas for similar stories in the same vein as the ones I have written. If any of you have any good ideas, please let me know. I have received a bunch of good ones that I have added to the list of stories I plan to write. My next story should be out relatively quickly. Keep your eyes out for "The Hotel Room," coming soon.) Report_Story
