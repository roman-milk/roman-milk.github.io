Little Man and the Stupid Bitch

I guess the first thing you need to know in order to understand what happened is background. My name is Robert Daltry; I'm twenty-seven years old and I work as an aircraft mechanic for a major airline. I'm five foot six, about a hundred and sixty-five pounds and I'm in great shape thanks to daily runs and work outs at the gym. 

 I've always been small – at least in relation to my peers – and it goes back to my parents. My father was five foot six and my mother was four foot ten. Always being smaller than those of the same age was not a good thing to be. Bigger kids, especially at younger ages tend to take advantage of those smaller and that happened to me a lot. From the second grade on I averaged two fights a month and I usually lost. They might have been bigger, but I never backed down and I usually got whipped. 

 By the time I hit the seventh grade I wised up some. I woke up to the fact that fighting back gained me nothing so I changed and started walking away. I know that the prevailing wisdom was fight back and eventually you will be avoided as being more trouble than you are worth, but that never seemed to hold in my case. It seemed like the more I fought back the more fun it was to pound on me. Walking away got me labeled a coward, a sissy and a wimp, but so what? I knew that I wasn't any of those things; I was just tired of getting a bloody nose two or three times a month. 

 All through junior high and high school I just walked away. I avoided the places where the bullies might be and if I saw one I would turn and go the other way. Of course my avoidance of trouble caused me some problems. Some of the people who thought of me as a coward, wimp or sissy were the girls that I wanted to date. I had a hell of a crush on Beverly Abbeg in eighth and ninth grade, but I could never get her to go out with me. One day she flat out told me to leave her alone. 

 "All my friends would laugh at me if I was seen dating a sissy." 

 Although they were too nice to say it to my face like Beverly did I got the same vibes from other girls I tried to date. I did have a social life because there were girls who said yes when I asked them out, but they weren't the ones I really wanted to be out with. 

 All in all it didn't break my heart when I graduated and left my classmates behind as I got on with my life. 

 My dad was an aircraft mechanic and I decided early on that I also wanted to be an A & P mechanic. I enrolled at the Spartan School of Aeronautics and began the course of instruction that would get me my Federal Aviation Agency Airman's Certificate as an Airframe and Power Plant mechanic. I finished the course, took the exam and got my license and then my dad used his influence (he was a shop steward for the union) to get me on at the same airline where he worked. 

 Because I was the new guy I had zip for seniority so I ended up on the grave shift where I could count on staying until I had six or seven years of seniority. That might get me afternoons, but I was at least fifteen years away from reaching days. Low seniority also meant that I had piss poor days off. I had Tuesday and Wednesday and the only way I would ever get a weekend day off was to day trade with another mechanic who had a Friday, Saturday or Sunday for days off and who needed a Tuesday or Wednesday off for some reason. 

 Working the midnight shift – from eleven-thirty at night until eight the next morning – was awkward in other ways also. You got off at eight and you had to make a choice. Go home and go to bed, sleep during the day and then get up and have the evening free until it was time to go to work or stay up during the day, go to bed around four and sleep until the alarm woke you up to go to work. Or maybe go home, do stuff during the morning, go to bed around noon and sleep till eight and have a couple of hours during the evening before going to work. 

 For the first six months I did a mixture of all three before settling on a schedule that worked for me. There was a golf course a mile from the hanger and I had to drive by it every morning on the way to my apartment. I stopped every morning and played nine holes, alternating between the front and back nine, and then I went home and went to bed. I got up around four and on Monday and Thursdays I bowled in a men's early house league. I kept Tuesday and Wednesday open for dates if I could come up with one or for hitting the bars if I couldn't and then maybe every six weeks or so I would take advantage of my pass privileges and go somewhere. 

 My favorite watering hole was Chester's Bar and Grille and it was mostly because it was the hangout for a lot of the guys I worked with and as an added attraction Chester's had a sexy as hell barmaid and a couple of foxy waitresses. I didn't waste my time trying to come on to them as they were constantly being hit on and I didn't want them looking on me as just another drunken clod, but they were sure nice to look at and fantasize about. I found out that it sometimes pays to be nice and polite. Since I never went after the girls after a while they started flirting with me and I eventually did date both Ann and Gail and I did score with both, but it was obvious that other than having some occasional fun there was no long term attraction there. 

 Chester's had a dance floor, but unless you could get off on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday when there was a live band you had to settle for the juke box. There were seldom any girls in Chester's on a Tuesday or Wednesday night so it was mostly shooting the bull with your buddies or shooting pool. 

 It was a Tuesday night and I had arrived at Chester's to find that none of my friends were there so I took a seat at the bar and made small talk with Kelly the barmaid. There were maybe a dozen people who had put four tables together in the back corner and it sounded like they were celebrating someone's birthday. Kelly had just served me my second beer and had gone off to take care of a customer at the other end of the bar when someone sat down on the stool next to me and a voice said: 

 "Howdy stranger." 

 I turned and saw Mellanie Butler. "Where have you been Robbie? I haven't seen you in over three years." 

 "Off to school for two of them, but I've been back almost a year now" is what I said, but what I was thinking was "You haven't seen me in three years? You've never talked to me before in your life." 

 Mellanie had been a classmate of mine since seventh grade, but we travelled in different social circles. Mellanie was the 'Golden Girl'. She was the girl that all the other girls wished they were like and she was the girl that all the boys wanted. She was beautiful, smart and talented. Homecoming Queen, cheerleader, class valedictorian; you name it and Mellanie was it. The face of an angel and a body that inspired lust in males of all ages. I was no different from all the other boys who wished that Mellanie was theirs, but I was also one who knew that it would never happen. Mellanie was always on the arm of one of the jocks. The star forward during basketball season; the quarterback or starting running back during football season and whoever was the star on the baseball team during baseball season. Us mere mortals never had a chance. In addition to all of her other qualities Mellanie had one that put her totally out of my reach – height! Mellanie towered over me at five foot ten. She was the unattainable dream girl and there she was sitting next to me and trying to engage me in conversation. 

 "We are celebrating Marsha Crowley's twenty-first birthday. Why don't you come over and join us?" 

 "I don't think so. I wouldn't want to intrude." 

 "Nonsense! You know everyone there. Consider it a mini class reunion." 

 "I'd really rather not" I said. 

 She shrugged, took my hand and pulled me off my bar stool and led me over to the tables. 

 "Hey everybody, look who I found." 

 I knew everyone at the tables, some better than others, and after the hellos were exchanged we began playing 'catch up.' A few were in college, three were married stay at home moms and the rest were all working. Someone put money in the juke box and a few got up to dance. A couple of girls looked at me with "come on, ask me to dance" looks on their faces, but I hesitated because every one of them was taller than me. I've danced with taller girls and I've always found it to be awkward as all get out. After a minute or so Mellanie took matters in hand and grabbed me and pulled me out onto the floor. Luckily a fast tune was playing so I didn't have to take Mellanie in my arms. We did two fast songs and then sat down to sip our drinks. Mellanie had shown the way so when the next girl wanted to dance she just got up, took me by the hand and pulled me out onto the floor. I danced with four girls that way and three of the dances were slow, but they weren't too awkward because the girls, even though taller than me, were not that much taller. Marsha, Betty and Sally were about five foot seven and Mary was just a shade over eight. I danced a couple more fast numbers with Mellanie and then the party started breaking up. I was just getting ready to leave when "Nights in White Satin" started playing and Mellanie said: 

 "That's my song. Come on Rob; you have to dance this one with me." 

 I didn't want to because I knew we would look ridiculous out there on the floor, but how could I say no to the girl I would have killed for in high school. It probably looked funny as hell to those who were watching – the top of my head at Mellanie's nose, but as silly as it might have looked I was in Heaven. The heat of her body, her scent and the way she held me close to her all combined to give me a hard on and Melanie couldn't help but feel it as her leg hit it from time to time. 

 I was sorry when the song ended and I had to walk Mellanie back to the table. Then I received my biggest surprise of the night. As I was saying my 'goodbyes' Mellanie handed me a slip of paper and said: 

 "Call me." 

 I looked at the paper and saw that it was a phone number. I looked up but Mellanie was already headed for the door. 

 For the next couple of days I wondered why Mellanie wanted me to call her. The only ay I was going to find out was to call so I called and she seemed glad to hear from me. 

 "I wondered if you would call." 

 "I almost didn't." 

 Let me guess. A little matter of three or four inches, right?" 

 "That's a good part of it." 

 "And the other parts?" 

 "To be absolutely honest about it I am nowhere near what you are used to. I remember the guys you hung with in school." 

 "We obviously need to sit down and talk. Do you like lasagna?" 

 "Yes I do." 

 "Tomorrow then. Lasagna, garlic bread and a bottle of Merlot." 

 She gave me directions to her place and I hung up more confused than ever. 

 That night at work I worked an engine change on a Convair 440 and I was too busy to think about Mellanie, but in the morning it all came back. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on. Why would a girl like Mellanie be showing an interest in a guy like me? I was in pretty good shape, I wasn't bad looking – at least I didn't think so – but there was no way that a girl like Mellanie would have any interest in me. 

 I rang the doorbell at seven and when she opened the door I handed her the bottle of wine I had picked up. I sat at her kitchen table and we made small talk as she finished dinner. I learned that she would graduate with a degree in Chemical Engineering and already had a job lined up. She asked me to pour the wine and then we sat, sipped, ate and talked. She wanted to know what it was like working for an airline and she was especially interested in how pass privileges worked. 

 "I love to travel. Maybe I should have looked into being a stewardess." 

 "You wouldn't like it; at least not for the first couple of years." 

 "Why not?" 

 "You would find yourself in basically the same circumstances that I'm in. Seniority rules in the airlines and until you build up some you are on the bottom of the totem pole. With me it is grave shift and days off that suck. With you it would be months or even years of being on what they call reserve which means being on call to fill in when someone calls in sick or to cover vacations. I've dated stews on reserve and more than once I've shown up for a date only to find a note taped to the door telling me that they are sorry, but they have been called in. Even when you get enough seniority to bid a block you end up with the ones no one else wants. It wouldn't be until you had five or six years in before you could bid and hold the good trips." 

 "Yuck! I guess what I'll have to do is marry you so I can travel on your privileges." 

 "Yeah, right!" 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "You and me? The tall Nordic Goddess and the shrimp?" 

 'What is with you and the height thing? Since when has height been the major component of a relationship?" 

 "I don't suppose it is, but you and me? I remember the guys you dated all through school and I'm a hundred and eighty degrees from them." 

 "And whose fault was that?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Did you ever ask me out? No, you never did, but the guys you saw me with did. A lot of them were meat-heads, but they did ask me out and what girl wants to sit at home on a date night? If I wanted to go out I had to accept the ones who asked. That they were all athletes was probably because the sports they played gave them confidence in themselves and made it easier for them to approach girls. Do you have any idea what it is like to see guys you would like to get to know better ignore you because they don't think they have a chance? I went all through high school and the first two years of college dating who I dated because guys like you sat on your duffs thinking you had no chance with a girl like me so you never asked. It has only been the last year or so that I said to hell with it, I'll do the asking. 

 "Would you have gotten off that bar stool and joined us if I hadn't pulled you off of it? Would you be here tonight if I hadn't pushed it? I want to get to know you better Rob and I don't give a rat's ass that you aren't as tall as I am. What do you have to say to that?" 

 "Guilty as charged. I never thought that I would have a chance in hell so I never asked." 

 "What are you going to do about it?" 

 "My next day off is next Tuesday. Would you like to go out and have dinner with me?" 

 "I'd love to. So, tell me more about what it is like to work for an airline." 

 The first date led to a second which led to a third and then a fourth, fifth and sixth. It was on the sixth date that she sandbagged me. It was one of my rare Friday nights off – I had day traded with Bill Hencle – and I arrived at Mellanie's apartment to pick her up for dinner, drinks and dancing. When she opened the door and I had to tilt my head way back to look up at her. She was wearing four inch heels. 

 "Don't you dare think about height here Rob. I wanted to look my best for you and I look my best in heels." 

 Wisely I kept my mouth shut and keyed in on the "I wanted to look my best for you." As I drove to Duke's Steakhouse where I had reservations Mellanie talked about were she would like to go dancing and wouldn't you just know that she would pick the most popular place in town? The place would be jam packed and all I could think about was how many people were going to see us and laugh. I swear Mellanie could read my mind because she said: 

 "You need to get rid of that "I'm shorter than you" mentality Rob. When we walk into a place and you see people looking at us you need to smile and say to yourself "Eat your hearts guys, she is mine." 

 That hit me right in the pit of my stomach. Not "She is with me" but "She is mine." Jesus, were that it was true. When we walked into Duke's I did see guys looking at us and I did what Mellanie suggested. I smiled proudly and mentally said the words "She is mine." Mellanie saw the smile and she gave me one that lit up the room. The same thing happened when we got to The Pit. I will not say that the dancing wasn't a bit awkward because it was during the slow tunes, but we got through it without me embarrassing us. 

 When I got her home there was another major change. After the first and second date I walked her to her door and got "I had a really nice time" and a kiss on the cheek. On the third through the fifth date I got a kiss on the lips, but that night she invited me in. She told me to have a seat on the couch and then she left the room only to return a minute later with a beer which she handed me. "Be right back" she said and she left the room again. Three or four minutes later she was back. She still had her heels on, but she was wearing a bathrobe. 

 "I don't know what it is that bothers you Rob, but it needs to be gotten out of the way. I'm not used to what is going on. Do you have any idea of how many guys I've had to fight off in my life? And the one guy I don't want to fight off won't even try anything. I don't know if the problem is that you still think of me as unobtainable or what, but I've decided that if you won't make a move then it is up to me." 

 She opened the bathrobe and I saw that all she had on were her heels. She let the robe slip off her shoulders and fall to the floor and stood there waiting to see what I would do. I still felt that Mellanie was way out of my league, but I was smart enough to know what to do when presented with an opportunity like that. I stood up, kicked off my loafers and started to unbuckle my belt. Mellanie pushed my hands away and said: 

 "I'll do that. You get the shirt." 

 By the time I had my tie, shirt and tee shirt off she had my trousers and briefs down around my ankles and my cock in her mouth. I was instantly hard and after a couple of licks and sucks she took her mouth off me and as she helped me step out of the puddle of clothing around my feet she said: 

 "I see that all of you isn't short." 

 That confused me for a second or so before I realized that she was talking about my cock. I wondered if because I was short she thought I'd have a little dick. Not that I considered that my equipment was all that big. I thought seven inches was about average, but no way was I going to bring up the subject. Mellanie stood up, took me by the hand and led me into her bedroom. 

 When you were my size and sometimes had trouble getting dates you some times needed an edge when you finally scored so early on I did my best to find out what girls really liked and then did my best to deliver it. High on the list of what most girls liked and could never seem to get enough of was having their pussy eaten. I went after Mellanie's pussy like a dog after a meaty bone and in minutes I had her crying out for me to never stop. I brought her off twice before she pushed me away and mounted me. She rode me until I came and then she went down on me and got me up again. I did her doggie until we both got off again and then we fell asleep together. In the morning I woke up to see Mellanie on an elbow looking down at me while her hand played with my cock. 

 "Good morning lover. One more time before breakfast, okay?" 

 Her manipulations had me up and ready and I smiled at her and rolled her over onto her back. 

 On the drive to the IHOP on Curtis and Euclid we talked about everything but what had occurred that night. Once seated and after our order had been taken Mellanie said: 

 "It should be obvious to you after last night that I wasn't a virgin." 

 I started to say something, but she stopped me and said, "Let me finish what I have to say. I haven't been a virgin since junior high. There have been at least fifteen before you and I know that your question is going to be "Why are you telling me this?" I'm letting you know that I have seen and experienced what is out there and I have a damned good idea of what I need and what I want now that it is time for me to settle down. When I compare all the ones before you to you they all come up lacking. I was going to say "come up short" but changed it at the last second because I know that you being shorter than me is a big problem as far as you are concerned. It is not a problem for me. I'm more into the person than I am into physical appearance. I think that you and I have future if we can just get by you worrying about the height problem. Okay, your turn."  

 

 

===

I didn't know what to say and I was trying to organize my thoughts when our food arrived. Eating gave me some time and when the empty plates were cleared away I said: 

 "First off, I don't care how many guys you have had a relationship with. I didn't go into last night a virgin either and my feelings are that what happened in the past is none of my business. As far as us having a future I don't know. The four inch difference in our height may not be a problem for you, but you are right in that it is a problem for me and not for the reasons you might think. I have no problem being by your side and I do smile and think "Eat your hearts out, she is with me." The problem is I do not think that you will be all that happy with the situation after a couple of years. I just can not believe that you won't eventually want someone you don't have to bend down to kiss; someone whose shoulder you can put your head on when you dance. In short, to use the word that you avoided using, I don't think that we can make it over the long haul." 

 "You are dead wrong Rob and the only question here is how do I prove it to you?" 

 "I don't know that you can Mel." 

 "You have to let me try Rob." 

 Even though I didn't think that there was a chance in hell we could make it work I would be brain dead to not at least give it a try and so I told her to go for it. 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- 

 Mellanie and I dated for the next four months and those dates almost always ended up in her bed or mine. There was a bit of a down side to the relationship. I could only date on my days off and there isn't really a lot you can do on Tuesday and Wednesday. And then I found out something that I guess I wasn't supposed to know. Mellanie dated on the weekends. She never mentioned it to me and the way I found out was one Monday I stopped after work for breakfast and saw Charlie Smithers sitting at a table alone so I joined him. After we finished eating and were drinking coffee Charlie asked: 

 "What happened between you and Mellanie Butler? It looked like you two had something going for a while." 

 "Why would you think that we don't any more?" 

 "I dunno. I just seen her two Saturdays in a row out dancing with another guy." 

 "Tall guy? Maybe six two or six three?" 

 "Yeah, about that I'd say." 

 "Thanks for letting me know Charlie." 

 I filed the information away in the back of my mind. I wouldn't say anything to Mel about it, at least not at that time. We weren't officially anything – not going steady, not engaged – just dating. Granted, we did spend both of my days off together and we did get together some evenings before I had to go to work, but I had no clear call on her time. I did ask Charlie to keep me informed if he saw Mellanie out on weekends and he said that he would. Three times over the two months he did call me and tell me that Mellanie was out and about with some guy he didn't know. 

 Three months went by and Mellanie graduated. Once she was out of school and established in her new job she started hinting that we should move in together. It was probably mean of me, but it was the opening that I had been waiting for. 

 "If we do that won't it interfere with your Saturday nights?" 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "I understand that on Saturdays and some Fridays you go out dancing and drinking with some guy." 

 "Oh that. It's nothing. I just don't want to sit at home on the weekends so if someone asks me out I usually say yes. It is just an evening out." 

 She stopped for a second and then the light bulb lit up. Oh. Oh my. You think....oh no! I swear Rob, no! Drinks and dancing and maybe dinner once in a while, but no fooling around. I sear Rob, no fooling around. I am a one man woman Rob and you are that one man." 

 Maybe I was being stupid, but I believed her. She talked more about us living together and I finally gave in. The truth of the matter was that even though I didn't think we had a chance in hell for the long haul I was crazy about her and living together gave me that much more time with her. 

 It was on a Saturday about a month after she moved in with me that she sprung it on me. We had just finished dinner and she had gone to take a shower. I finished cleaning up the dishes and headed for the bedroom. I walked in just as she slid a dress over her body. I saw that she already had her nylons and heels on. I stood there looking at her with a half dozen questions running through my mind and she saw the look on my face. 

 "I'm going to go out and have a few drinks with Rich Carling and we will probably hit a club or two for some dancing." 

 I didn't say anything and Mellanie said, "Oh come on Rob. You know I'm yours. Some drinks and dancing is all that will happen. You won't be here and I don't like sitting home alone on Saturday nights." 

 I was going to say something along the lines of don't you think we should have talked about this before you made plans" but I didn't. What I was thinking was "It is time for me to find out just what the fuck is going on." I just turned and left the room and dropped in front of the TV and turned on the History Channel. I was sitting there watching something about the Korean War when she came out of the bedroom. Just then a horn honked out front and Mellanie came over and bent down to kiss me, but I turned my head. She stood there and looked at me for a couple of seconds and then said, "I'll see you in the morning" and she left. 

 I waited five minutes to see if she would think better of it and come back and when she didn't I got on the phone and called in sick to work. I knew Carling's car and he had a vanity plate so it wouldn't be too hard to find. It might take a while because there were a dozen places where you could go dancing. I lucked out and found his car at the third place I tried. I got even luckier when I pulled in onto the lot and parked where I could watch his car. Just as I turned my lights off I saw Charlie Smithers pull in and park. I walked over to him when he got out of his car and asked him for a favor. 

 "Find out where Mellanie is sitting and then come back out and let me know, okay?" 

 "You going to cause any trouble?" 

 "No. I just need to know what is going on. I need to know if I'm being lied to." 

 Charlie was back in five minutes and told me that Mel and Rich were in a booth on the south wall of the building. That was good for me because I could go in the far door and Mel wouldn't see me enter. I could sit at the north end of the bar where it was fairly dark and watch with a limited chance of being seen. 

 I watched for two hours as Mel and Rich talked, drank and danced. Three times I saw Rich try to take liberties with his hands and each time Mel pushed his hands away. The third time Mellanie got pissed and said something and they left the floor, had a drink, talked for a bit and then went back out on the floor and this time Rich behaved himself. I finally decided that nothing was going to happen in the bar so I went back out to my car and waited. 

 It was another two hours before they came out and got in Rich's car. They drove to Denny's and had a bite to eat and then Rich drove Mellanie home. They pulled up in front of the apartment and sat in the car and talked for a few minutes and then they got out of the car and Rich walked her to the door. They said something to each other and then Mellanie went up on her toes and kissed Rich's cheek (he was about six foot four) and then she went into the apartment and Rich drove away. About fifteen minutes later I saw the lights go out. I drove out to the airport, parked in the employee's parking lot and slept in the car until it was time to go home. 

 I stopped at Village Inn for breakfast and when I got home Mellanie was up and fixing breakfast. She asked me if I wanted bacon or sausage and I told her that I had stopped and eaten on the way home. 

 "Why? I always fix breakfast on Sunday." 

 "You were out partying last night so I thought you would be sleeping in." 

 She got a pissed off look on her face and said, "I was home by midnight and went right to bed – alone!" 

 It was actually twelve thirty-five, but I wasn't going to say anything or she would know I had been watching. I didn't say anything, just went into the bedroom, took off my uniform and put on shorts, tee shirt and tennis shoes. I left for my daily run without telling Mel I was leaving. She was waiting for me when I got back and as soon as I was in the house she said: 

 "We need to talk Rob." 

 "After my shower" I said as I headed for the bathroom. When I came back into the kitchen she was sitting at the table and I got a bottle of water out of the fridge and joined her. She went right at it. 

 "Don't you trust me Rob?" 

 "Let me answer your question with a question Mel. If we were married would you go out dancing with guys on Saturday night because I was working and wouldn't be home to keep you company?" 

 "Of course I wouldn't." 

 "How about if we were just engaged?" 

 "No I wouldn't" 

 "Don't you think that living together is the rough equivalent of being engaged? Doesn't living together show some sign of commitment?" 

 "Not really Rob. Until you propose and I accept I don't see us as anything other than extremely good friends with an excellent benefits package. Super- duper roommates, but with no permanent relationship. That means that I should be free to go out and enjoy myself." 

 "I'll agree that you should be free to do what you want given the relationship that we have, but that freedom is one of the reasons that our relationship hasn't moved to a higher level." 

 "Why is that?" 

 "Who have you been dating on those Saturdays?" 

 "No one in particular. I don't date the same guys all the time." 

 "No, but you do date the same type." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Every one of them is over six feet tall. Remember way back when I said that I didn't think we could make it long term. That eventually you would want some one you didn't have to bend down to kiss or some one whose shoulder you could put your head on when you danced? That's where you are now Mel. You are dating men you are comfortable with. Tall guys. Every Saturday Mel, you go out and prove my point. But you are correct. You are right in that your time is yours and I have no call on you so let's drop the subject." 

 "So I can go out on a Saturday as long as it is with a short guy?" 

 "No Mellanie. As you pointed out I have no real claim on you so you just go ahead and go out with whomever you please." 

 I got up and went into the bedroom and went to bed. 

 Things were a little chilly around the apartment for a couple of days and then things smoothed out. For three weeks Mellanie stayed home on Saturday night, but then she started going out. There were no more dates calling for her at the apartment. This time she went out alone, did her thing and then drove herself home. From what I heard she was still meeting with tall guys. 

 Some major changes took place at work when the union negotiated rotating days off into our new contract. The way it worked was one week you had Monday/ Tuesday off and the next week it was Tuesday/Wednesday followed by Wednesday/ Thursday, Thursday/Friday and then came the good part – Friday/Saturday/Sunday and then Saturday/Sunday and Monday. Two week ends out of every six you had three days off. When you factored in the Thursday/ Friday it meant that three weekends in a row I could take Mellanie out drinking and dancing or do whatever she wanted to do and that put an end to her going out on Saturdays. 

 Once we had settled into the new day off schedule Mellanie started working hard at getting me to propose and even though I thought it would be a mistake in the long run I was too hung up on her to fight her off. I proposed, she accepted and we were married.

 Life was good and we were happy together. There were some minor hiccups along the way like the night of her company Christmas party. After the dinner and the speeches were all over with the live band began to play. Maybe half an hour later, after I had danced a couple of dances with Mellanie, a guy she worked with came over and asked her to dance. She looked over at me and I nodded an okay. What the hell; it was her party, right? 

 She got up and danced with the guy. He was a little over six feet tall and they moved well together. The song ended and the two of them stood and talked for a coupe of seconds and then the next number began to play and they went back to dancing. A third song started and another guy cut in. That song ended and the guy walked Mellanie over to a table where three other guys were sitting. They talked for a couple of minutes and then the guy who had just danced with Mellanie sat down and one of the men sitting stood up and walked Mellanie back out onto the dance floor. This guy was at least six two and as I watched them dance I was getting pissed. I gave the nod to one guy for one dance expecting her to come back to our table when it was over. The song ended and the two of them stayed out on the floor for the next tune. When it ended it looked like Mellanie was at last going to come back to where I was sitting, but another guy – over six foot naturally – came up to her and the two of them swung into the next number. Mellanie had apparently forgotten that she had come to the party with me. 

 I imagined that everyone in the place was looking at me and shaking their heads. I finished the drink in front of me and then I stood up and headed out of the ballroom. I was getting my coat from the coat check girl when Mellanie came rushing up. 

 "Where are you going Rob?" 

 "Home." 

 "You were just going to walk off and leave me here?" 

 "You wouldn't have been alone." 

 "What is wrong with you Rob?" 

 "Think on it Mel; you'll figure it out." 

 I had my coat on by then and I headed for the door. 

 "Wait Rob. I need to get my coat." 

 "I turned and said, "I've waited enough tonight" but I stopped at the door and waited for her to catch up. I headed for the car and she hurried along behind me. As soon as we were in the car she said: 

 "What in the hell is wrong with you?" 

 "Does the word 'abandonment' mean anything to you Mellanie?" 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "I'm talking about what I have been doing for the last half hour Mellanie." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "A man comes up and asks you to dance. You look at me and I nod an okay. You get up and go out onto the dance floor and dance with the man. What is supposed to happen next?" 

 "I don't know what you are trying to say Rob." 

 "What was supposed to happen next Mellanie is you finish the dance, come back to our table, he thanks you for the dance table and you and I – that's YOU and I Mellanie – get back to partying. But that isn't what happened is it? You stayed gone, danced with another guy, went over to their table and socialized for a bit, danced with two more guys and were still out on the floor dancing when I got fed up with being abandoned and got up to go. I'd be willing to bet that you would still be out there on that dance floor if you hadn't seen me get up and leave." 

 "That's not fair Rob. It was a party and I was having a good time. Maybe I got a little carried away, but you are making a mountain out of a molehill." 

 "Well I don't see it that way Mellanie. It was a party with the people you work with, none of whom I ever met before tonight, and you took off and left me sitting alone at our table for almost half an hour. Half an hour with no one to talk to and nothing to do but sit and drink while watching you make me look like a fool." 

 "I did not!" 

 "Of course you did. You didn't think I didn't notice all the people looking at me wondering why my wife cared so little about me that she could walk away and leave me alone." 

 "It wasn't like that Rob." 

 "Yes it was Mellanie. You got so wrapped up in dancing with guys you didn't have to look down at that you forgot all about me." 

 "That again!" 

 "What do you mean "that again?" 

 "You and that damned size thing." 

 "Bullshit Mellanie. It is about you walking away and leaving me there to sit alone and if you can't see that it was just plain wrong there is no point in talking about it any more." 

 "Fine!" she snapped and not another word was said on the rest of the drive home, but after we went to bed she put her hand on my cock and said: 

 "I'm sorry baby; I just didn't think. Forgive me?" she asked as her mouth closed over my cock. 

 We never mentioned that party again. 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ 

 Things were great for the first two years of our marriage and then Mellanie began to get kinky on me. Our sex life had been great. No, 'had been' is the wrong way to put it. Our sex life WAS great! But Mellanie wanted to spice it up. Oral sex had always been a part of our sex life and I enjoyed the hell out of Mel's blow jobs and I loved giving her oral pleasure. Mel wanted me to start eating her pussy after I'd cum in her, but the idea didn't appeal to me at all. I said no and she pouted, but she never stopped trying to get me to do it. Finally I broke down and did it. I didn't like it, but it didn't kill me and Mel loved it. 

 Next she wanted to try having sex in dangerous places – places where we might get seen or even caught. Again I didn't want to do it. I pointed out that they had laws against lewd conduct and that we could get caught by the cops and end up in jail, but she shrugged it off and kept pushing and eventually I gave in to keep Mellanie happy. 

 She gave me a blow job in the rear row of a movie theatre. We made love in super market parking lots with people pushing their carts past our car and we screwed on side streets under street lights. One time we were having dinner at Angelo's and the tables there had table cloths that hung down to the floor, Mel kept after me to go under the table and eat her pussy until I agreed to do it. I licked her pussy while fifty or sixty people ate, drank and talked all around us. Then she embarrassed the hell out of me. She told me no one was looking our way and that it was clear for me to come out from under the table. I did and came face to face with the waiter who was waiting to take our desert order. 

 He's already had his" Mellanie said, "And I'm too full to eat another bite." 

 The waiter left and Mellanie laughed and said, "You should see the look on your face. It's priceless." 

 "Go ahead and laugh damn it! We will never be able to come back to this place again." 

 "Don't be silly. From now on they will treat you like a king when we come in." 

 I was pissed, but Mel made it all better when she sucked my cock all the way home and then fucked me into exhaustion. 

 The worst one and the one where I should have said, "No! Not only no, but HELL NO!" was when she wanted to try anal. Not on her – we had always done anal – but on me. She wanted to do me with a strap on. I said no and she said, "Please baby, just one time?" and I said no again, but she kept on and I did what I always did when she pushed – I gave in. It hurt at first and I didn't like it, but the more she did it the more comfortable with it I became. I never looked forward to it, but it gave Mel pleasure so I went along with the program. 

 The next thing that Mellanie came up with to 'spice up' our sex life came about by accident. I was in a two week training class on a new aircraft that the company was putting into service and I got out of class at five. Mellanie got off work at four-thirty and we arranged to meet at Bogart's Lounge, have drink or two and then go out to dinner. 

 It was twenty minutes from where I was to Bogart's and when I got there I saw Mellanie sitting at a table with three guys. I had expected her to be sitting at the bar waiting for me. I was a bit taken aback when I saw one of the guys put his hand on Mellanie's leg just above the knee. I wondered how long it had been going on. If Mellanie got off work right at four-thirty and went straight to Bogart's that meant she had been there for about forty-five minutes. What had gone on during that time that made the man think he could put his hand on Mellanie's leg? What was even more disturbing to me was that Mellanie didn't push his hand away.  

 

 

===

I stopped where I was and watched to see what would happen next. There was some laughter and the man sitting across from Mellanie reached over and lightly touched her cheek and at the same time the man who had his hand on her leg moved it up six inches or so until he was right at the edge of her skirt. Again, Mellanie did nothing to stop the man. She might not stop him, but I sure as hell would. 

 I headed straight for the table flexing my fist in preparation of punching the asshole who was manhandling my wife even knowing that I was most likely going to end up fighting all three of them which would not end well for me. Mellanie saw me coming and gave me a big smile as she said: 

 "Here he is now." 

 I walked up to the table and Mellanie said, "Hi baby. This is Jim, Harry and Bill" and she pointed at them as she named them, "They offered to keep me company while I waited for you." 

 I got nods from the three of them, but the look on Jim's face (he was the one with the busy hands) told me that he was pissed that I showed up and robbed him of his "sure thing." Harry said: 

 "Pull up a chair and let us buy you a drink." 

 "Thanks, but we need to be going if we are going to be on time for our dinner reservations." 

 I offered my hand to Mellanie and she took it and stood up, thanked the guys for the drinks they had bought her and then we left. As soon as we were in the car I was going to jump Mellanie's ass for not doing something about Jim's hand, but as soon as the door closed behind her she said: 

 "I was wondering if you were ever going to come over to the table." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I saw you come in. When Jim put his hand on my leg I thought that you would come storming over, but you just watched as he moved his hand up my leg. Were you going to wait until he got to my pussy before coming over? Or maybe that's what you wanted to happen. Is that it baby? You want to see another man use me?" 

 Before I could say a word she said, "Skip dinner baby; get me home!" She slid over next to me and pulled my zipper down as she said: 

 "They wanted me baby. Jim thought he was going to get me. Get me home baby; I'm hot and I need it baby, I need it bad" and then she had my cock in her mouth. No way was I going to jump her ass about what had gone on at the table while she was sucking my cock and by the time we got home the only things on my mind were getting in the house, getting naked and getting it on. Mellanie flat wore me out that night. 

 In the morning we were both rushed to get out of the house on time so nothing was said until we were both at home that night. Before I had a chance to say "What on Earth were you thinking when you let that clown lay his hands on you last night" Mellanie hit me with: 

 "Last night was wild baby. Can we do it again?" 

 "Why would you even bother to ask that? We make love all the time." 

 "Not that baby. Oops, that didn't come out right. Of course we will keep making love. I meant the bar thing. Can we do it again?" 

 "The bar thing?" 

 "It was a huge turn on for me baby. Guys hitting on me, buying me drinks and doing there best to hustle me and me going along with it all the time knowing that I'll be laving with you and leaving them frustrated." 

 "It isn't a good idea Mel. I can see all kinds of trouble happening." 

 "Like what? What could possibly happen?" 

 "How about them getting belligerent when I come on the scene. How about my having to fight my way out of the bar?" 

 "That would never happen." 

 "Bullshit Mel. I walk up and one of the guys tells me to buzz off and when I don't he stands up and it goes from there. His buddies join in and I end up in the hospital. No Mel, not a good idea." 

 "Okay, how about this? No tables and no groups. I take a seat at the bar and wait for someone to hit on me. I tell him up front that I'm waiting for someone, but he's late. I know guys baby and the right one will think he can get me out of there before whoever I'm waiting for shows up." 

 "How is that going to work with me already being there and watching." 

 "How about you drop me off and come in a half hour later?" 

 "And while I'm not there looking out for you he slips a date rape drug in your drink and hustles you out the back door. What then?" 

 She kept coming up with scenarios and I kept shooting them down, but in the end I gave in to her like I always did. If it kept her happy she kept me happy. 

 The first time I went into the place first and took a seat at the bar where I could see most of the place. Mellanie came in about five minutes later and took a seat at the other end of the bar. She hadn't been sitting there five minutes before a man approached her. They talked for a minute and then Mellanie got off of her bar stool and went out onto the dance floor and danced with the man. They stayed out on the floor for two dances and then Mellanie joined him at his table and for the next hour and a half he bought her drinks and danced with her. 

 I watched as his hand slid down and cupped her ass and I saw him slid a hand across her tits. Did it piss me off? Damned right it did, but as long as Mellanie didn't let it get any worse I could live with it. Finally the guy got up and went to the bathroom and as soon as he was out of sight Mellanie grabbed her purse, got up and left the lounge. I got up and followed and it was a repeat of the last time. As soon as we were out of the lot Mellanie had my cock out and was going to town on it. She sucked on it all the way home and once there she exhausted me. 

 We did it maybe half a dozen more times with the same result – Mellanie being super hot for sex, but then the inevitable happened. A guy came back quickly from the men's room and chased Mellanie out into the parking lot. 

 "Where do you think you are going bitch? You ain't drinking my booze and playing me for a sucker." He grabbed her arm and said, "Your choice cunt! Your back seat or mine." 

 By then I'd caught up with them and I told him to get his hands off of her. He turned to me and snarled: 

 "Butt out ass wipe." 

 When you are me you don't fuck around with guys bigger than you and you don't fight fair. "Ass wipe" wasn't fully out of his mouth when I nailed him in the nuts as hard as I could. No talking, no threats, no posturing, just a hard shot to his stones followed up by several kicks to the body and head. I hustled Mellanie into the car and we took off I was keyed up and my hands were shaking and I looked over at Mellanie and was about to say "No more Mellanie" but she was tearing at my zipper and then she went after my cock like her life depended on draining my balls. That night she fucked me so hard and long that my dick was actually hurting when she finally quit. I fell into an exhausted sleep. 

 The next morning Mellanie surprised me. "I think we need to cool it for a while. Last night almost got out of hand." 

 I agreed with her and for three weeks we didn't play 'the game' but then one Friday night she wanted to do it again and to keep her happy I went along with it. 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- 

 We had been married just short of three years when Mellanie's desire to add 'excitement to our sex life did us in. 

 One of the benefits that Mellanie had at her job was that she got her birthday off as a paid holiday so she was going to be off on Friday. Just before I left for work on Thursday night she told me to come straight home in the morning because she had a surprise for me. I chuckled and said: 

 "It's your birthday and I get the present?" 

 "Exactly. Straight home now, okay?" 

 "Okay." 

 "Call me as soon as you pull into the drive so I can be ready for you." 

 She kissed me goodbye, walked me to the door and said, "Don't forget. Straight home and call me as soon as you pull in the drive." 

 That night was a busy one. I was assigned a double brake change and a service check on a DC-9 and I didn't have any time to think about what Mellanie might have planned. As I was punching out in the morning a couple of the guys asked me if I was going to stop for breakfast and I almost said yes until I remembered I had to go straight home. 

 As I pulled into the drive I used my cell phone to call Mellanie and when I got to the front door she opened it and stood there smiling at me. She was wearing four inch 'come fuck me' pumps with nylons and a garter belt. She had on a bustier that pushed her tits up and out, but only covered the bottom of her breasts. She stepped back and said: 

 "Good enough to eat?" 

 "Hell yes!" 

 "Come on then" she said and she took me by the hand and led me to the bedroom. In the bedroom there was a chair sitting next to the bed and she told me to get naked and sit down on the chair. I did what she wanted and then she laid back on the bed, reached under a pillow and brought out an eight or nine inch dildo. "Watch baby" she said and she slid the fake cock into her pussy. I watched as she looked me right in the eye and stroked the dildo into her pussy with one hand and rubbed her clit with the other. She worked the toy in her pussy until she started to moan and then she speeded up the strokes until she had an orgasm. I was sitting there with a hard on as she came down from her orgasm. She tossed the dildo aside as she said: 

 "Now I'm ready for the real thing." 

 I was just starting to get off the chair and join her on the bed when the closet door opened and a naked man walked out. He walked straight to the bed and climbed on as Mellanie said: 

 "Watch this baby; it will be wild." 

 I sat there stunned as it all happened in front of me. I couldn't believe it. It had to be a joke of some kind, but I wasn't laughing as the man slid his hard cock into Mellanie's hole. As the guy walked from the closet to the bed I noticed that he was six three or six four and I remembered all the times I'd told Mellanie that I didn't think she would be happy with a guy shorter than she was and here was the proof that I had known what I was talking about. I also noticed that even though the guy was tall his cock wasn't any bigger than mine. At least one little bright spot in what was turning out to be a shitty day. 

 On the bed the guy was pounding into Mellanie and she was squealing as she wrapped her legs around the guy and dug her nails into his ass as she pulled him to her. I was torn between getting up, grabbing the guy by the hair, pulling him off the bed and kicking his balls into mush and sitting back down and watching it to the end just to find out what Mellanie thought she was doing. Why did she have me get naked and sit on a chair just to watch what she was doing? What I did know was that Mellanie and I were through and all that was left to do was involve the lawyers and the courts so I decided to stay seated. 

 It took ten minutes for the guy to cum and when he pulled out of Mellanie's cunt she thanked him for his help and he walked over to the closet he had come out of, picked up his clothes and walked out of the room. Mellanie smiled at me, held her arms open and said: 

 "Your turn baby. Come on over here and let me fuck your brains out." 

 I couldn't believe it. She was acting like it was nothing, just business as usual. I got up and went to the open closet, reached up to the top shelf and got down the gift wrapped box. It had a card scotch-taped to it and I carried it over to the bed and handed it to Mellanie. 

 "Happy birthday Mel" I said as I handed her the package and then I picked up my clothes and started dressing. Mellanie was busy opening and reading the card and she didn't notice me dressing until she turned to look at me and say: 

 "Oh baby, that is just so swee.... What are you doing? Why are you putting your clothes back on?" 

 "I could get in trouble leaving the house naked Mel." 

 "Leave the house? Why would you leave the house?" 

 "Don't be stupid Mellanie. After what you just did there is no way I can stay here. No way in hell that I even want to be around you." 

 "What I just did? All I did baby was add some spice to our sex life. You can't tell me that it didn't turn you on. You sat there and watched and you had a hard on." 

 "You weren't paying very close attention Mellanie. I had a hard on watching you with the fake cock, but it went away when your lover's cock stabbed your cunt." 

 "But you sat there and watched." 

 "Mostly because I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I was curious to know why you did this to us." 

 "I didn't do anything to us Rob. What I did was for us. It was to add excitement to our love life." 

 "Did you even stop to think about how exciting it would have been if I had reacted differently and pulled your lover off of you and then beat him half to death and then turned on you?" 

 "In the first place he is not my lover. He is just a guy I know from work that I asked to help me out with the surprise. And there is no way you would have pulled him off of me and beat on him. You just aren't that kind of guy." 

 "Not that kind of guy? Is your opinion of me really that low Mellanie? You see me as some wimpy little dude? Have you already forgotten that asshole in the parking lot?" 

 "That was different Rob. He was going to try and hurt me and you knew it. You could see that Todd wasn't hurting me. You are not some "wimpy little dude" Rob, now get your clothes off and get over here." 

 "No thanks Mel. I'm not the least bit interested is some other guys left-overs. Sloppy seconds has never been my bag." 

 I turned and walked out of the room, left the house, got in my car and went looking for a motel room. As I drove I thought about the card I'd given Mellanie. I'd spent over an hour going through all the cards on the card racks at the store looking for the perfect card. The words came back to me: 

 "There aren't enough words to tell you I love you, 

 Not enough ways to show you I care, 

 Not enough laughter and good times to wish you, 

 Not enough wonderful moments to share... 

 A million bright mornings would not be too many, 

 Long evenings forever would still be too few, 

 For I need you and love you so much that it seems 

 There aren't enough days in a lifetime with you." 

 Yeah, right! 

 My cell phone had been going off constantly since I walked out and I knew all the calls were from Mellanie so I just let the phone chirp away. I checked in at the Best Western and when I got to the room I looked at the phone and saw that I had fourteen missed messages and five voice mails. I deleted the call register and played the voice mails. They were all basically the same. 

 "Rob honey, we need to talk. You are taking this the wrong way. Call me baby, please call me." 

 I deleted the voicemails, turned off the phone and went to bed. I didn't sleep all that well as my mind was on what Mellanie had done. I could not for the life of me figure out why she thought that what she did would be okay with me. 

 I was up at seven and hit the Black Eyed Pea across the street from the motel for a bite to eat. I stopped at the Safeway for a few snacks and a carton of Coke and went back to my room, I turned on my phone and saw that I had eleven missed messages and five voicemails and I deleted them all and turned the phone back off. The only people who ever called me on it were my mom, my sister, my brother and Mellanie. I'd call the family and let them know what was going on and then I'd have no reason to turn the phone on until I got a new number – a number Mellanie would not get. 

 My mind wasn't on my job that night. I just could not get over what Mellanie had done. I knew that for my own piece of mind I was going to have to sit down and talk with her, but it wasn't going to be for a while. I did not believe that I could ever get violent with Mellanie, but given the mood I was in I didn't think it wise to put myself in a position where it might happen. 

 When eight o'clock came and it was time to punch out one of the guys standing at the time clock with me said: 

 "Got something going on this morning I see." 

 "What makes you say that?" 

 "Your wife is out in the parking lot waiting for you." 

 I went to the break room and looked out the window and sure enough Mellanie was parked next to my car. I went through the hanger and out the back door to the employee's bus stop and caught the shuttle bus over to the terminal and went down into the basement to the employee's cafeteria. I ate a leisurely breakfast and then I toured the two bookstores in the terminal until I figured Mellanie had given up waiting and had gone on to work. I caught the shuttle bus back to the hanger and Melanie was gone, but she had left an envelope under my wiper blade. I was tempted to tear it up and throw it away, but decided not to. I was going to have to talk to her eventually and maybe there was something in the note that would give me a clue as to what was going on. I opened the envelope and read the note inside. 

 "Rob, please call me. We need to talk before things get too out of hand. Don't ever doubt that I love you baby. Please please call me." 

 Get out of hand? What the fuck would you call fucking another man in front of your husband and in his own home and on his own bed? I crumpled up the note and tossed it aside. By the time I reached the room I had calmed down a bit and had come to the realization that we did need to talk and soon. The more I knew about what had gone on the better I would be able to make an informed decision on what to do. Go for Irreconcilable Differences or Infidelity on the divorce? The lawyers would answer that question, but they would have questions and the more answers I had for them the better off I would be. 

 We hadn't gotten around to having children so I didn't have to worry about child support. Mellanie made more than I did so alimony wouldn't be an issue. All I could see happening was dividing up what we had and then moving on. I took a deep breath and called Mellanie at her work number. I got the receptionist and asked for Mellanie. 

 "Hello?" 

 "It's me." 

 "Where have you been? I've been worried sick." 

 "Spent the night in a motel." 

 "Why on Earth did you do that?" 

 "Oh for God's sake Mellanie don't be so stupid. You know damned well why." 

 "It wasn't necessary baby. All you had to do was let me explain." 

 "There is no fucking way you can have a reasonable explanation for what you did. No way can you explain away cheating on me." 

 "I didn't cheat on you. You were right there." 

 "You know what I mean Mellanie." 

 "You are wrong Rob. Cheating is when you sneak around. What I did was out in the open and I didn't hide anything from you." 

 "This is getting us no place. Your note said you wanted to talk. What do you want to talk about?" 

 "I can't do it while I'm here at the office. I'll leave work a little early tonight and be home by five-thirty and we can talk then. Is that okay with you?" 

 All right Mellanie; I'll be there." 

 "I love you Rob. Please remember that." 

 "Yeah Mel, sure. Whatever you say." 

 I got home around two and packed up my clothes and some odds and ends and moved them to the motel. I was sitting at the kitchen table when Mellanie got home and she rushed to me and tried to put her arms around me, but I held her off. She got a hurt look on her face and then she sat down opposite me. 

 "You wanted this meeting Mel so go ahead and speak your piece." 

 "I want to know why you ran off and left me without even talking to me." 

 "Jesus Christ Mellanie; you are a college graduate, top of your class so you can't be as dumb as you are sounding now. I left to keep from wrapping my hands around your throat and choking the hell out of you for fucking another man. How could you not understand that?" 

 "But it didn't mean anything Rob. All it was was something to add so excitement to our sex life. Okay; maybe I should have prepared the ground a little better, but I wanted it to happen on my birthday so I probably moved faster than I should have."  

 

 

===

"Prepare the ground? You aren't making any sense here Mellanie." 

 "You would have been all right with what happened if I had just taken the time to get you ready." 

 I looked at her like she was from outer-space and she saw my face and read my expression correctly. 

 "Oh come on Rob. You would have and you know it. You always give in to me." 

 "You are out of your ever loving mind Mellanie. There is no fucking way that you could have talked me into going along with what you did." 

 "You said the same thing when I tried to get you to try public sex, but you did it. You said the same thing when I tried to get you to eat me after cumming in me, but you did that too. The same thing with the bar scene thing. I wanted to do it and you said no, but you did it when I pushed. And what about my using the strap-on on you. You said 'no way' but I pushed and you did it. You went along with it because it was what I wanted to do and you would have gone along with watching me with Ted if I would have spent the time getting you ready for it. You are a submissive Rob even though you probably don't realize it. It is the main reason I married you." 

 "I thought you married me because you loved me." 

 "I do love you baby and I have for longer than you know, but love alone would not have been enough for me to marry you. I know me lover and I know that I have to be the dominant partner. I would have married a man I didn't love if he were the right kind of man – a man I could control. That is why I was so happy to marry you. I not only got the kind of man I needed, but I also got the man I loved." 

 "Me a submissive? You are crazy Mellanie. I've never had a submissive day in my life." 

 "Of course you have baby. I'm not talking about a get down on your knees "yes master" or "yes mistress" type of submissive, but someone who goes along and avoids confrontation. Someone who gives in rather than fight about it." 

 "And that is how you see me?" 

 "It is you baby. I know you better than you know yourself. I watched you all through junior high and high school and you walked away from every confrontation. And you have always allowed yourself to be pushed into things. Take that night at Chester's. You didn't want to dance and you didn't want to join the group, but I forced it by grabbing your hand and pulling you off that barstool and so you went along. At the table you didn't ask anyone to dance and you wouldn't have, but again, I grabbed your hand and forced the issue and you went along. The other girls saw the way I handled you so they did it also. We never bothered to ask you – we just took you and you went along. All through our relationship if I wanted something and you didn't all I had to do was put a little pressure on you and you always came around. You would have given in on the thing with Ted too. I just misjudged things. I did want to do it on my birthday so I hurried things instead of taking my time." 

 "I don't care what you say or think Mellanie; there is no way that I would have gone along with what you did." 

 "Yes you would have Rob, especially once you knew that the next time it would have been me sitting on the chair watching you with another woman." 

 "What?" 

 "That's right baby. The next time the roles will be reversed. In fact, now that I think about it, maybe we should have started with you and another woman." 

 I shook my head in disbelief and muttered, "I don't believe this; I just don't fucking believe this." 

 "What did you say baby?" 

 "I said I can't believe this. As long as we have been together and you don't know me any better than that? When did I ever give you any indication that I would be open to what you did? When did I ever suggest that I would like to have sex with another woman or that I would be willing to watch you with another man?" 

 "The way you made love to me when we played the bar game was the indication. What I did with Ted was the next logical step in the progression. Again, I should not have rushed it. The point here Rob is that it is what I wanted to do and frankly I don't see anything wrong with it. You are acting as if I did something to shame you and that just isn't true. All I want to do is keep our love life exciting. I don't want us to ever reach a point where it is twice a week, ho-hum, roll over and go to sleep. Okay, you don't like the idea of me with another man so we won't go there again. I still owe you a time with a woman while I watch, but then we won't do it again." 

 "You don't owe me anything Mellanie. I am not going to do another woman while you watch." 

 "You have to Rob. We have to keep it even." 

 "No we don't Mellanie. You crossed the line when you pulled that stunt with Ted. You killed our marriage Mellanie. I don't know where you got your twisted ideas about what kind of man that I am, but you are totally wrong. I walked away from confrontations in junior high because by then I had learned that getting into it with guys bigger than me usually ended up with me getting the snot beat out of me. Once you know you can't win it makes no sense to keep on fighting so I took the verbal abuse and then walked away. That was not me being submissive Mellanie, that was me being smart. And another thing Mellanie. That night at the bar, did I turn and walk away from the asshole who was going to drag you into a back seat? Just in case you forgot he was a good six or seven inches taller than me, but I was there for you when I needed to be. 

 "I didn't want to get off of that bar stool that night at Chester's because two of the guys who were sitting at that table were guys who used to beat the hell out of me in grade school. I didn't want to dance with you because of the size difference, but I let you pull me into it because I'd always had a crush on you and quite frankly I never expected to see you again after that night. I didn't ask any of the girls at the table to dance because I didn't know who was with someone and who was stag and given my prior history with two of the guys at that table I wasn't going to take a chance that something wouldn't start. And there was the size thing. Three of the five, not counting you, were taller than me and I have always been uncomfortable dancing with girls who are taller than I am. When one of the girls took me by the hand and pulled me toward the dance floor I went because it would have been impolite and would possibly have caused a scene if I would have jerked my hand away and told them to leave me alone. I did not 'submit' and I was not 'controlled.' And the way I made love to you after the bar thing had nothing to do with me be turned on by seeing you flirt with other guys. It had all to do with the way you were when we got home. You were hot and horny as hell and I was feeding off of you. I was turned on by the way you were making love. 

 "The things you got me to do I did for you because I loved you and I wanted you to be happy. Again Mellanie, I was not submitting – I was giving. And as far as you knowing me better than I know myself? The one thing you SHOULD KNOW and apparently don't is how I feel about size. If you knew me as well as you think you do you would have known how I was going to react when you took on a lover who was six three or four. I always told you that I wasn't big enough for you and that some day you would get tired of short little me and want some one who was taller. I hate to be an 'I told you so' but you went and did what I always knew you would do. But I guess that I can't bitch. I had you for a lot longer than I ever expected and I suppose I should be thankful for that. 

 "But now you have me wondering about your wanting me to eat my cum out of your pussy and letting you use your strap on on me. Getting me ready for Ted or one of your other lovers? Is that what was next on your "keep excitement in our sex life" parade. Have me suck your lover's cum out of you? Let your lover do me in my ass?" 

 "Jesus Rob, how could you even think something like that?" 

 "It isn't any farther for me to go to believe that than it was for me to go to believe what you did last night." 

 I got up and headed for the door. 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "Back to the motel. I doubt that I can find a divorce lawyer before Monday, but as soon as I get one I'll call you with his number. You should probably get one too. As far as the divorce is concerned we are in a 'no-fault' state, but you still need to make sure that you are protected." 

 "Divorce? Oh no you don't Rob. We are not getting a divorce. We belong together and I am not letting you get away. Make up your mind to that Rob; there will be no divorce." 

 "It isn't your choice Mellanie. You made your choice when you spread yourself on our bed for your tall lover." 

 "Damn it Rob; he is not my lover. You are. All Ted was was a tool I used to add some excitement to our sex life. Okay, so I guessed wrong as to what I could do with you, but I can promise that it will never happen again." 

 "Maybe not, but you would probably pull off some other stupid stunt that I wouldn't like either. How could you not? After all, I'm just some wimpy little submissive that you can control, right? I'll call you with his name when I get an attorney." 

 I left with Mellanie yelling, "Don't go Rob, don't go." 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- 

 I didn't hear the door open and then close. I was vaguely aware that something in the room was different. Sort of like the feeling you get when you are half asleep and half awake and in your subconscious mind you feel that something isn't right. I felt a mouth close on my cock and since I had been dreaming of Mellanie for an instant I thought that I was still dreaming, but then I came awake and saw Mellanie. She swung over me and pushed herself down on my cock. 

 "What are you doing" I stupidly asked. 

 "Claiming my husband and my lover." 

 "I don't want this Mellanie." 

 "What you want doesn't matter little man. It is what I want. You are mine and I'm marking my territory." 

 "Little man?" 

 "Yes Rob, little man. You are constantly on the size thing so I've given up and I'm going with it. Compared to me you are little. Compared to some other men I know you are little and since you keep harping on it I simply decided to call a spade a spade. You are a little man, but you are MY little man. The key word there lover is MAN. You are little, but you are all man and all the man I've ever wanted. You are mine Rob and I WILL NOT let you go. Get used to it my little man; you are stuck with me for the rest of your life. There will be no divorce, no trial separation and no time outs. You will never be able to get away from me. You can try, but I will hunt you down just like I did this time. I will be a permanent stalker in your life. Get used to it because you are not going to get rid of me." 

 She leaned down and kissed me and rolled off of me and pulled me on top of her. "Make love to me lover" she said as she wrapped her long legs around me, grabbed my ass with both of her hands and pulled me to her. As upset with her as I was there was no way I could quit now that she had me that far along, but I was still pissed enough to try and punish her. I slammed into her as hard as I could, but she didn't seem to care. 

 "That's it little man; fuck me, fuck me hard." 

 I was gasping for breath when I finally busted my nut, but Mellanie wasn't done with me. She pushed me off of her and moved down to take my cock in her mouth again. All thoughts of telling her to go away and leave me alone were gone as she worked to revive my cock. It started to come back to life and she took her mouth off me and said: 

 "You want to punish me little man?" She got on her hands and knees and said, "Take my ass little man. No grease, no finger work, no slow and easy. Just take my ass. Ram it in me." 

 Mellanie loved anal, but only if I took my time working up to it and used lots of KY Jelly. And even then it took minutes to work my way in and give her time to get used to it. Once in and she was acclimated it was 'Katy bar the door.' What she had just done was tell me to make her hurt. She was telling me to give her a ton of pain to make up for the pain she had caused me. 

 "Do it little man, do it. Punish me!" 

 She waggled her butt at me and I moved in behind her, gripped her hips and then shoved myself as deep in to her as I could go. 

 "No!" she yelled. "My ass, you have to take my ass." 

 I ignored her and slammed my cock into her pussy. "MY ass" she wailed, "You have to use my ass." 

 Even as she cried that she was pushing back on my cock. 

 "Shut up Mellanie. I'm not going to fuck you in the ass." 

 "You have to; you have to fuck my ass." 

 "No I don't you stupid bitch and if you don't shut the fuck up I'll stop what I am doing." 

 "No" she moaned, "Don't stop, don't stop." 

 Another minute went by as Mellanie orgasmed and then orgasmed again and then I was there and I emptied into her cunt. I rolled off of her and she fell to the bed on her stomach. I was looking up at the ceiling, breathing hard and then I asked: 

 "How did you find me and how did you get here?" 

 She didn't answer right away, but then she said, "I called every hotel and motel in town and asked if my uncle had arrived yet and checked in. Once I knew where you were a twenty dollar bill to the maid got me in the door." 

 "Why? Why did you bother?" 

 "You can't be that dumb Rob. I love you and I'm not letting you get away. If you don't come home to me where you belong then I have to come to you. Get used to it lover. I am not letting you get away." 

 There was a moment of silence and then she asked, "Why didn't you take my ass?" 

 "Because it would have hurt you." 

 "I wanted you to hurt me. What I did caused you pain and I needed to balance the scale. I needed you to cause me pain to punish me. I had to even things up between us. I know they weren't the same kinds of pain; mine would be physical where yours was mental and emotional, but I had to do something to atone for the hurt I caused you. Why did you call me a stupid bitch?" 

 "Because you have to be stupid if you think I could deliberately hurt you and you had to be stupid if you thought that I would get off on watching you fuck another man. What's with the little man shit?" 

 "Trying to make a point. You always judge other men who you see me around by their size and you are always telling me that you know that some day I'm going to want to be with a taller man. You are always thinking of yourself as smaller so I just decided that if that is how you want to see yourself I'd just go with the flow." 

 "You don't see it as an insult?" 

 "Of course not. It is how you see yourself. The point Rob is that you are my man. Regardless of your height you are and you will always be my man. I can't help it that I'm around taller men. You got pissed because of all the tall guys who danced with me at my company Christmas party, but did you notice that they were the only ones who asked? There were guys there who were shorted than me, but not one of them asked me to dance and I didn't go after them. I've only gone after one short man in my life and that is you. And just for your information that is a distinction you share with no one else short or tall. You are the only man I have ever gone after and I got you and I'm going to keep you. 

 "I don't see ho..." 

 "Just shut up Rob. I know that it isn't going to be easy, but we will get past my stupid blunder. Nothing like that will ever happen again. I owe you one and I don't care what it is or what you do. Beat me, have an affair with someone, whatever, but you have a 'get out of jail free card' that you can use whenever you want. I'm not letting you go Rob. You are mine and you are going to stay mine. Get used to it." 

 While she had been talking she had been playing with my cock and she had gotten it up again. She swung over me and settled down on me and said: 

 "We can keep on doing this here and waste money on a room or we can go home and save the money, but I am never going to be very far from your cock from now on and like I said, get used to it. So why doesn't my little man take his stupid bitch home so she can spend the rest of her life showing him that he is all she wants and needs." 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ 

 You know, I guess that I am a little submissive at that. I let her browbeat me into going home with her. That was five years ago and she has done her best over those five years to fuck me to death. She still comes up with ideas to help keep the excitement in our sex life, but has never even come close to trying to involve third parties. And me? I guess I'm finally getting over the idea that some day I'll lose her to a taller man. For a couple of years at her company Christmas parties she wouldn't even look at me to see f I would mind if one of her tall co-workers asked her to dance. She just said no thanks, but at the last one when a six footer came over and asked her to dance before she could say no I told him just to make sure she got back to me before the party ended. Mel looked at me for a long second and then she mouthed "I love you" and got up to go out on the floor with the man. I sat there and watched them dance and smiled to myself as the words "eat your hearts out guys, she's mine" crawled through my mind. Report_Story
