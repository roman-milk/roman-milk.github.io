Becoming A Slut Wife: Christina
===============================

===

Note from Just Plain Bob - I did not write this story, I merely copied it. Some time ago I received an email from Christina telling me how much she liked one of my stories. A week later she sent me an email commenting on another story of mine. Then she said that she wished she could write: 

"I've turned into one of your slut wives. If I could write I could probably make a story out of how I became what my hubby calls a 'hot wife." 

I emailed her back and told her to send me the particulars and I would write her story for her. She did and I saw immediately that while she didn't think she could write she was wrong. Her story follows almost exactly as I received it. The only changes I made were to remove a few things that might have identified her if someone she knows were to read the story. 

Her story did inspire me to write one of my own called "Pillow Talk" and hopefully I will post it soon. 

So, without further ado and in her own words I give you the story of Christina's trip toward becoming a slut wife.

Here's what I got together It covers the last year. I hope this helps you. 

I'm not a writer, so please be patient while reading it. 

For years and years my husband has been addicted to "hot wife" or "slut wife" stories and his habit is to print out the ones he likes and leave them on my pillow for me to find after I've put the kids to bed and get ready for bed myself. I have to say that it has been a pretty successful strategy for him. It's not a guaranteed thing, but at least it gets the conversation started. So, over the years I've read many, many stories and, yes, since my husband picks them only 99.8% of them have been about hot wives. 

Me? I'm coming up on 33, stunningly beautiful, built like a Victoria's Secret model, awesomely intelligent, and so sexy the Kennedy boys would have dropped Marilyn Monroe for me in a flash. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! Also I'm a wife (over ten loving years), a mom and a career woman. 

If my husband will settle for just hearing about fantasy infidelities then I can accommodate him that way, but you would have to say that it is a little strange. He said he would never ask me if what I tell is true or made up. 

My hubby's problem is that I'm NOT a slut (at least not with anyone else). He has been trying to get me over to the "dark side" for years. As I said, if he reads a story about a cheating wife or, even better, watching a cheating wife with several men, I guarantee I'll find a copy on my pillow. How subtle, but he does score high marks for effort and perseverance. But other than refusing to sleep (well, not "sleep") with ten studs while he watches he has no complaints in the sex department. Believe it or not, the above scenario (or thousands of variations) has been his burning desire since our honeymoon when he begged me to bed a bartender who took a shine to me while we stayed at the resort. I politely declined. 

After our honeymoon hubby showed photos of me in a tiny honeymoon bikini to all of his friends and co-workers. Hubby couldn't keep them to himself as I had begged him to and it made some social occasions a tad uncomfortable for me for a while after they had been passed around. Since then I avoid him like the plague whenever I see him with our digital camera. Lord knows they would be out on the Internet in seconds. Photos on the Internet is exactly why I won't pose for my husband when he begs. After I found out he had shared our honeymoon photos I knew he would do it again at the drop of a hat and of that I am absolutely sure. I understand and I am flattered. It's not every over thirty wife who has a husband as proud as he is about my appearance and sexuality. I would probably pose for all the naughty photos he wanted - IF - he would promise me that he would keep them for his own enjoyment - something he refuses to do. 

Often when we go out I do dress a little more sexy for him, and I do enjoy his obvious appreciation of the way men look at me. I am not totally heartless to him. Understand, it DOES feel good to turn a man's head at the mall or a PTA meeting. And I do understand the "Trophy Wife" attitude. I understand, it IS a very male thing, but what about the next step, where the husband not only wants to show his wife off, but share her? With the trophy wife he is saying, "See what I have and that you don't (or can't) have?" But when he shares her they can and do have her. She has suddenly become accessible and is no longer held high as a trophy. That's where I get confused. Is it because the husband "is giving his permission" to the other men? Or is it that the wife will do whatever the husband says and therefore he shows his mastery over her? 

I thought for sure that my hubby would be like some of the husbands we read about - wanting it and wanting it, but being very upset if he ever got it. However, hubby proved me wrong. 

Over a year ago I had to go to a weeklong training/conference session. When I got home Gary quizzed me on if anything happened. I said "no" but I said it intentionally in a way that kept him pestering me. Finally I "broke down (even crying)" and admitted that I'd had too much to drink the last night and wound up in a man's room doing the dirty. I begged his forgiveness and he THANKED ME! He said he was sorry that he wasn't able to watch me, but he wanted to know everything. I made up a story of me and this guy having outrageous sex. Hubby became insatiable! He couldn't keep his hands off of me and for the next three days we had sex almost non-stop and everywhere in the house. If we would have had a chandelier I'm sure that Gary would have found some way for us to have had sex swinging from it. On the forth day I confessed that nothing had happened and that I had made the whole thing up and he refused to believe me. After a week or so I THINK I got him to believe nothing happened (it didn't), but he often asks me to tell him about that wild nigh. I do and I admit it certainly heightens his enjoyment (which cranks up mine). Still, he really surprised me with his easy acceptance of my story being true so I decided from time to time to make up other stories for him. 

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAST YEAR (if it isn't here it didn't happen) 

2005 - March 

The company I work for had a large and very nice awards dinner and I had a delightful night out and a fairly exhausting week afterwards. Hubby doesn't like those kinds of affairs so he usually won't go with me to them. He says that his staying home keeps us from having to pay for a baby sitter, but I finally figured out the real reason. He wants to give me the chance to play and he is afraid that if he is there I won't. 

The awards dinner was very nice, held in a private room at an upscale hotel. It ended at 10 PM, far too early for me to go home to stage my planned "affair." I joined two other married women from my company and we went into the hotel's lounge. It was fairly crowded and we were asked to dance, several times, and we did. A little after 11 PM my friends said they were leaving - still too early to go home for my plan, but I didn't want my friends to think I wanted to stay and get "picked up" so I walked out to the parking lot with them. When their cars left, I went back inside. 

I sat at the bar alone, something that I had not done in years and years. It was a little exciting to be there. I nursed a drink and danced with two nice gentlemen and then I moved to a table to sit with one of them. His name was John and I told him that I was married and was enjoying a rare night out and was only interested in a friendly drink, some pleasant company and some dancing. He said that he had hoped for more, but that was fine. After midnight the disc jockey was playing only slow songs and the dancing got closer. 

We chatted and danced and the time flew by. I suggested coffee at the 24-hour diner just down the road and John agreed. Before we left the hotel I retired to the restroom and removed my bra and panties in case my husband was awake when I got home (if he wasn't I was going to wake him). 

After coffees John walked me to my car. He had been such a gentleman that when he leaned over for a kiss I let him. It was a nice kiss even though it was closed mouthed. We said our "good nights" and then my handshake led to another kiss and that one was a lot more passionate with a lot of tongue and while my tongue played with his I had the thought that I could really make my hubby's day if I just went ahead and let John have what he and my husband wanted. I toyed with the idea, I really did, but when I felt John's hand slide down my front and came to rest on my pubic area with only my skirt between us I quickly broke away from John and got in my car. The last thing he said to me was: 

"Any chance of changing your mind?" 

"No, but thanks for making the old married lady feel good." 

I drove away breathing a little heavier than usual. I guess it was the booze and being an "old married woman", and away from the bar scene for so long. Thank God John was a gentleman. 

At 2:10 AM I walked into the house and made my way to the bedroom. In the car mirror I had mussed my hair and lipstick. Gary was awake when I opened the bedroom door and he said "Hi" and I said, "Oh, you're still awake." He asked me if I had a nice time and I told him I'd had a very nice time. He asked if the dinner had run this late and I told him no, that it had been over at 10. He asked me what I did after. As I answered I opened my blouse and let it drop to the floor and I saw Gary's eyes take in the fact that my bra was missing. "We went into the lounge and danced" I said as I unzipped my skirt and let it fall to the floor. 

"Where are your under things?" 

"In my purse." 

"Oh. Anything you want to tell me?" 

I smiled at him and said, "I had a few drinks and danced with some guys and we fooled around a little. I enjoyed myself. Nothing much beyond that to tell" I said in a way that had to make him think there was a whole lot more to it than just drinks and dancing. The no undies and the "fooled around a little" had his brain churning and he pulled me down on the bed (still in my stockings and heels) and we were awake almost till dawn. After we put the kids to bed Sunday night we were right back at it. It had been our best sex since I lied to him about the business conference. I knew then that I was going to keep the imaginary slut wife thing alive and well for quite a while. 

FIRST FRIDAYS 

The first Friday of the month has traditionally been an unofficial go-to-the- bar-night at my company for years. I've probably gone maybe three times in the last two years and have never stayed later than 8 PM, but I told my husband I'd had such a good time at the awards dinner that I planned to go that week and he probably shouldn't wait up for me. He was thrilled. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS MAN??? 

APRIL FIRST FRIDAY 

I went to the First Friday Happy Hour and had a few drinks and a few laughs, but by 9 PM I was asking myself "What in the hell are you doing here?" There was no one I really wanted to spend time with and if I was going to play the role for my husband, I'd have to think of something to keep me busy for another 4 or 5 hours. So I went to a movie and ate too much popcorn and then I went home and led hubby to believe that I'd been bad again. It was a repeat of the night of the awards dinner. I swear that I was walking bowlegged when I went to work on Monday. Gary kept me up all Friday night and the sun was peeping through the windows when he finally let me go to sleep. He made love to me seven times between noon Saturday and the time I finally fell asleep Sunday morning and another five times between the time I put the kids to bed and left for work on Monday. 

MAY FIRST FRIDAY 

We had a large crowd in a new lounge, happy hour prices, free hot appetizers and a disc jockey playing tunes. We had a great time all evening. Around 11PM or so our group was down to four and we decided to call it a night. They left and I decided to hit the ladies room before leaving. On the way to the bathroom a guy sitting at a table with three other men grabbed my wrist (gently) and asked: 

"How about a dance beautiful?" 

"Okay, but I need to use the ladies room first." 

As I walked away he grabbed my ass. When I came back from the ladies room I stopped at the table and said: 

"I've decided not to dance with you because you are rude." 

One of the other guys at the table asked me if I would dance with him and I said yes, more to rub the rude man's nose in it than because I wanted to. I danced with him and when we went back to the table another one of the men asked me for a dance and I danced with him and then the third guy asked and I went out on the floor with him. He asked me to join them and to rub the rude man's nose in it some more I said okay. After one dance one of the men tried to kiss me and I saw rude boy watching so I let him. Then of course the other two wanted to kiss me and I let them. The kisses got hot and then hotter and they started feeling me up. I let them get away with it because rude boy was still watching. 

Over the next two hours the men bought me drinks, danced with me and felt me up. I was getting pretty hot and when one of the men took my hand and put it on the lump in his trousers I left it there. He kissed me and as our tongues wrestled I stroked his cock. He took it out of his pants and I actually started to give him a slow hand job. About that time rude boy, tired of being the brunt of his buddies comments, got up and left. One of the men asked me to dance and I let go of the cock in my hand and followed him out onto the floor. 

By midnight the music was slow and the lights were down low and I was kissing the guys and their hands were roaming all over my body and I was loving it. They were under my skirt, on my butt and my boobs were caressed outside and inside my blouse. They took turns sitting next to me at the table and by the time the night was over I had held each one of their cocks in my hand. I knew, even if they didn't, that if there had only been one of them he might very well have gotten lucky that night. Even as high as I was and as good as I was feeling I knew if I did one of them I would end up with all three of them wanting some and I wasn't going to do that. 

Surprisingly, they were gentlemen when I called it a night and one of them walked me to my car where we spent several minutes in passionate kissing. He managed to talk his way into my car and we engaged in some more passionate necking. He managed to get my right boob out where he could munch on it and before I knew it he had two fingers in my pussy and his cock was in my hand and I was jacking him off. He was maybe two seconds from having me to the point where he might have gotten me into the back seat when his cock spit out all over my hand and that was my wake up call. I hustled him out of the car and went home. When I got home Gary was waiting up for me and even though I told him all I did was drink and dance he saw the cum spots on my dress and he noticed how wet my panties were and you know how we spent the rest of the weekend. 

JUNE FIRST FRIDAY 

Nothing to report on the June first Friday. A large group of us went to another bar and we had fun until around 10 PM when we called it a night - all of us beat from the long hours we had been working. Hubby was disappointed that the evening was uneventful. Now he says I don't have to wait for the first Friday to go out and enjoy myself. He isn't fooling me. He just wants me to be able to have more chances to give him his fantasy. 

JULY 

Nothing to report for July. Spent most of the month with visiting relatives who were on vacation and not going anywhere where I could do something to turn Gary on. 

AUGUST - Intern party and lounge night. 

A co-worker, Karen, organized our "The Intern and His Harem" night out for our intern's twenty-first birthday. It was perfect. The intern, Danny, was leaving and going back to college and Thursday was his last day on the floor. On Friday he would only be coming into the office to get his evaluation and exit interview from the bosses. 

On Wednesday at lunch Karen took us to an "Adults only" store to buy gag gifts for Danny's birthday. We almost giggled ourselves to death the rest of the afternoon. Karen told us to dress as sexy as we dared for work on Thursday. I wore a suit with just a satin and lace camisole under it and before we left for dinner I went to the bathroom and removed my bra and rolled my skirt several inches at the waist. With the heat I wasn't wearing any stockings or pantyhose so I was bare legged in my high heels. We all looked good and sexy when we climbed into Mary's mini-van (she volunteered to be the designated driver). All five of us women were married and had children. 

Karen had reserved us a private room at a very nice Chinese restaurant. We had a drink before the meal and wine with the meal so we were in good shape when they popped the cork on the bottle of champagne after dinner. And then it was time to open the gifts and what a blast that was. We were merciless to Danny and he had a permanent blush on the entire time. The main gift was a blow up sex doll and we tried and tried to get Danny to show us how to use it, but he wouldn't. 

Karen put a CD in, playing slow, romantic music and then she turned all the lights off and with just a few candles lit we all took turns dancing with Danny. It wasn't long before his hands were all over us and we were returning the favor. There was some heavy kissing involved and I loved it when he turned me around, filled his hands with my breasts and ground his hard on into my ass. I was just a little surprised at the size of the lump that I felt in Danny's pants and I almost pulled him into a dark corner so I could take it out and look at it. In fact, I was just getting ready to do that when Mary pulled him away from me to dance with her. 

After about an hour more of dancing it was time to call it a night. On our way back to our cars Karen sat with Danny on the rear most seat and it was soon pretty obvious that she was giving Danny a blow job. Danny escorted each one of us to our cars and I hung back a little so I would be the last. When we got to my car I turned and kissed him and then his hands went to my breasts and mine went to the lump in his trousers and seconds later we were in my car, my blouse was off and I had his cock in my hand. It was big! I'd seen a few before I married Gary and Gary's was a pretty good size, but Danny's was big! I stroked it as I stared at it and suddenly I was thinking Karen was married and had children and if she could suck Danny's cock I should be able to do it to. I looked at him and asked: 

"Do you like older married women playing with your cock?" 

"Hell yes!" 

"Did Karen give you a good blow job?" 

"All blow jobs are good." 

"I'm better than she is," I said as I lowered my head and took his cock in my mouth. 

Whew! When I got home if Jerry hadn't been awake I damned sure would have wakened him. I kissed him and then asked him if he could taste Danny. It was another sex filled weekend and I was almost glad to go to work Monday just to get away from Gary. 

NIGHT OUT WITH KAREN 

On the next night, Friday, I went out with Karen. We had dinner at her country club and talked about the previous night. She said her husband's rule was "What he didn't know wouldn't hurt him" and as a result he never asked her questions about where she went or what she did. We stayed and danced for a while and then, after midnight, she drove us to a downtown mega-bar. It was in an old warehouse or something and it had a different themed bar on each of its four floors. We went right to the 4th floor where there was a dark lounge that was furnished with couches and love seats and where soft, quiet music was being played. There was no dance floor, everyone just sat around in those little private areas and talked.  

===

We sat down on one of the couches, ordered drinks and it wasn't long before we were joined by a pair of nice guys. We sat and talked for a while and then Karen and her guy got real quiet and it was easy to see why. She and her guy were all over each other. Soon my guy and I were doing the same. Lots of passionate kisses and hands traveling all over each other and he got two fingers in my pussy and finger fucked me to an orgasm and then I took out his cock and jacked him off. I caught his cum in a cocktail napkin and put it in my purse to take home and leave somewhere where Gary would find it. Karen told me that she was going back to her guy's place for a while, and I caught a cab back to my car. 

In two days I had done enough to keep my husband happy for an entire month. It never even occurred to me that I was getting closer and closer to the wife that Jerry really wanted. 

SEPTEMBER 

After my night at the intern party and the next night at the hook-up lounge with Karen, Gary escalated his wishes for becoming a cuckold. Before we left for vacation he wanted me to promise to fuck the next guy to feel up my boobs. I told him that he needed professional help. 

We went to the seashore with the kids and my mother in law so there were no 'wild goings on' around the rental. However, with his mother as a built in baby sitter we did get to go out most evenings. 

One night we went to this new gigantic club with several levels and indoor and outdoor bars. The place had DJs, loud music and the crowd ranged from retirees to kids with fake Ids. It was packed with people. During the course of the evening hubby got to watch me dance with several different men anywhere from ten years younger than me to twenty years older and all of them had a good time feeling me up. One young guy, maybe five years younger than me got his hand down inside the front of my skirt and was rubbing my pussy through my underpants and I looked over at hubby and saw him smiling while he watched. 

The next time we went hubby played the cliched "I'll park the car and join you inside. It was well over an hour before I saw him again standing over in a corner watching and hoping. I was sitting at a table with a crowd and I danced, necked (rather passionately at times), was felt up and did some feeling up of my own (I ran into a lot of hard dicks in those clubs). But to hubby's disappointment nothing else happened. 

A couple of nights later it was Friday and we went back to the big club. Hubby dropped me at the door and pulled the "I'll go park the car" routine on me again. It was shoulder to shoulder inside the club and I was being felt up just walking through the place. I finally wound up outside on an artificial beach. It was still crowded, but at least there was room to move. I soon had an attractive man (Alan) buying my drinks and dancing with me. It seemed like hours and I hadn't seen my hubby at all. 

Things started to develop and as we were dancing cheek to cheek Alan leaned down for a kiss. It was terrible! I hadn't kissed such a terrible kisser since I was a teenager. He was sloppy, wet and all over the place on my face. He obviously had no idea of what to do with a nipple because he squeezed mine like I was a bug on the wall or something. I quickly excused myself to go to the ladies room and then I made sure that I didn't return to Alan. After some effort I finally found my hubby and said: 

"Let's go home and have our own fun" and that's just what we did. 

Of course hubby wasn't about to let a Saturday night go by so we cruised a few clubs (all very crowded), but after Alan I wasn't in any big hurry to try and get anything going. I did dance with a few guys and got felt up some, but I grabbed hubby and drug him home early. We went out some over the second week and I did dance and smooch as hubby watched, but nothing more. 

On our last Friday night we went to the big club again and hubby did the park the car thing as I went inside. It was the usual hands all over my body as I walked through the place looking for a seat. I managed to get to the bar and get a drink and I was standing there looking around the room for a seat when this real cute guy walked up to me and told me there was an empty chair at his table and he offered it to me. I accepted and found myself sitting at a table with four guys who all had to be ten years younger than me, but they were all kind of hunky looking. Hell, what old broad doesn't like having young studs after her. 

For the next two hours I danced and kissed and got felt up and had hard cocks pushed into me and I totally forgot that my hubby was even there (not that I'd even seen him since walking in). Finally one of the guys asked me if I would like to go outside for some fresh air and I let him talk me into going for a walk on the beach. We walked a little way until it was darker and a lot less crowded. 

We sat down and started making out. Things got a little heated and the guy had my blouse open (I was braless), my skirt up around my waist and his fingers inside me. As we swapped tongues he skillfully finger fucked me to an orgasm and when I settled down I reached for his fly and opened his shorts. I intended to give him a hand job, but suddenly I had the feeling that hubby was near. 

I took his cock in my hand and stroked it a few times and then I leaned forward and slipped my mouth over the head. I pushed his legs apart and cupped his balls. I ran my tongue around the head of his hard cock while gently playing with his balls. I took him deep in my mouth and then I took my mouth off of him and sat up. I looked into his eyes and then I kissed him. I slipped my tongue in his mouth and let his wrestle with mine while my hand stroked him and then I broke the kiss and my mouth went back to his cock. I licked and sucked on him and he put his hands on my head as I bobbed up and down on him. 

I could almost feel hubby's eyes on the back of my neck as he watched form somewhere close by. He was there; I knew it, I could feel it. 

I pulled my mouth off the cock and circled the head with my tongue and then I ran it down the underside, licked his balls and gently sucked on them for several seconds and then I drug my tongue along the topside. Once more around the head and then I took him back in my mouth and deep throated him. His cock hit the back of my throat and I felt his balls tighten and he arched his hips up at me and shot three or four spurts of cum against the back of my throat and it started to slide down into my stomach. 

I stroked his cock to get the last drops out of it and then I sat up and kissed him again. I pushed my tongue into his mouth so he could taste himself and then I broke the kiss. 

I couldn't believe I'd done it. On a public beach with people walking along the waters edge not more than thirty feet away I had given a blow job to a kid twelve years younger than me (I found out later that he was only eighteen - in my defense he looked twenty-four or five). After I'd wiped my mouth with the back of my hand we put ourselves back together and went back into the club. 

We no sooner sat down at the table than one of the guys asked me to dance and by the time the dance was over and we got back to the table Brian had clued the other guys in on what we had done. For the next hour I might as well have been fucking the guys on the dance floor. They took me out there two at a time and I would have one grinding into my ass while the other one was grinding into me from the front. If my skirt and panties had been off they would have been in me. I was hot. I was literally hot enough to fuck and when Sam asked me to take a walk on the beach with him I said yes. 

We walked to about the same spot where Brian and I had been and sat down. The necking was hot and heavy and the second set of fingers that night not my husbands went into me and gave me a screaming orgasm. I fell back on the beach and spread my legs and told Sam to fuck me. He was all set to fall on me when I told he had to put on a condom and he sheepishly told me he didn't have one. He had to settle for a blow job. We walked back to the club, but I didn't go in. I knew if I went in that I would be taking a walk on the beach with Randy and then Phil and that as hot as I was if neither of them had a condom I might end up fucking them anyway. I gave Sam a passionate kiss goodnight and headed for the parking lot. I hadn't gone ten steps when my hubby caught up to me. 

"God that was hot. Why didn't you fuck the second one?" 

"I didn't want you to have any kids to raise that weren't yours." 

"Huh?" 

"He didn't have a rubber." 

"Oh. Good thinking." 

We were both so hot that we fucked on the back seat right there in the parking lot and stopped twice on the way back to the rental to do it again. Then vacation was over and we returned to the real world. 

LATE SEPTEMBER 

I did the deed, I stepped over the line, I hooked up, I committed adultery, I broke my wedding vows, and I was a slut, a tramp, unfaithful, a fallen woman. And I loved it! 

I had been selected for a "train the trainers" class taught by a young contractor (Brad) who seemed to have eyes for me. After the training session his company treated the 7 trainees (2 men, five women) to an outstanding dinner at a wonderful restaurant (why not, for what our company paid them). After dinner Brad asked me if I would like to have a nightcap with him at his hotel. He was a hunk! I had spent a good part of the training session watching him and wondering what he would be like in bed. 

I excused myself to go and powder my nose and called my husband and told him about it. His response was: 

"Burn every detail of what happens into your brain so you can tell me everything when you get home." 

I went back and told Brad that I would meet him at his hotel. He told me he would be in the lounge and I said: 

"No. Give me your room number." 

He must have been standing just inside the door waiting for me. I knocked once and the door immediately swung open. I walked in and put my purse on the little table. I had stepped across the line and there was no need to be coy about things. Even as he was asking me what I would like to drink I was taking off my dress. I dropped my dress to the floor and said: 

"You don't really want to waste time drinking do you?" 

I stepped to him and offered him my mouth as my fingers busied themselves with belt buckles and zippers. His tongue darted into my mouth as his arms went around me and hands unsnapped my brassiere. My bra fell to the floor at the same time his trousers pooled around his ankles. I broke the kiss and said: 

"You get the shirt while I take care of the shoes and socks." 

I knelt in front of him, his already erect cock bobbing in front of my face, and I removed his penny loafers and socks as I teased the head of his cock with my tongue. I stood up and he lowered his head and his mouth took in my right nipple and I shivered at the thought of what this man was going to do to me. He was going to make me a fallen woman and make my husband a cuckold and the weird part was that both my hubby and I were okay with the idea. 

I let him work the nipple and my hands went down and took hold of his cock and I started stroking it. He led me to the bed and I lay down and spread myself for him. He moved to lower his head to my honey pot and I stopped him. 

"No foreplay lover, no slow and easy. I want the first one hard and fast. Take me from faithful housewife to whore in seconds. We can play later." 

His spear lanced into me and in three strokes he was in as far as he could go and then he gave me what I asked for - he fucked me hard and fast. 

"Hard and fast?" he said, "You got it" and he started ramming his cock into me. I could feel his balls slapping against my ass when he shoved his cock in deep. The angle was perfect for his cock to rub against my clit as he stroked in and pulled back. I shoved myself up to meet his strokes and I felt him go even deeper into me. I felt the pleasure building in my center and I locked my legs around him and cried: 

"Oh fuck yes, oh sweet fucking Jesus yes, fuck me Brad, fuck me harder, fuck me harder." 

He rammed into me and I was moaning in pleasure and then my orgasm hit and I clawed at his back and cried out, "Oh Fuck!" and then he groaned and I felt his juices flood my hole. I was just getting ready to get up and suck his cock to get him hard again when he surprised me. He didn't go soft! He started to, but suddenly he was going the other way and his cock stayed hard enough to penetrate. 

He fucked me slowly, pulling out a little and then shoving back in. He started giving me long, hard strokes until I started to moan and then he started fucking me hard and fast again and it triggered another orgasm. For several more minutes he pounded into me as I had one orgasm after another. He reached under me and took my ass in both hands and pulled me to him as he rammed hard into and then he stopped and held himself against me as he pumped me full of his cum. 

And that was just the start of the night. 

The kid was terrific in bed. I had forgotten what it was like to be with a young stud (he was only 22) with recuperative powers. During one of our rest breaks we talked and he told me that at 14 his best friends sexy mother took him under her wing and taught him how to please a woman. Believe me, her lessons weren't wasted. He was a brainiac who graduated from Cal Tech before his 19th birthday and his company had snapped him up and was now teaching him the marketing, training and sales end of the business. 

Anyway, we did it five long and very satisfying times. The kid was a fantastic fuck, so how lucky was I that when I finally did do the deed the guy I did it with really knew what to do with his tongue and cock? I know I walked around with a Cheshire Cat grin on my face all the next day. 

I reluctantly left his room around 5 AM as he was dressing to fly back to California. I gave him my number and told him to call me whenever he came back to town. I had just enough time to race home, give hubby the fuck of a lifetime, shower, dress and hit the road back to work. God, I was tired. I was getting too old for this. 

I called hubby three times that day to check that what I did was still okay with him now that he'd had time to think about it in the daylight and for a few hours. He was still ecstatic and looking forward to when we got the kids in bed that night. I hope his feelings don't change over time because I can't undo it. 

I looked back and thought that it all started on our honeymoon when he wanted me to fuck that bartender and then him showing every one he knew the photos of me in my bikini. Add to that the way he likes me to dress and how he likes me dancing with other men, his constant encouraging my infidelity and his slut wife stories left on my pillow. He finally got what he wanted so I hope he really is happy. 

NOVEMBER 

We went to a very large neighborhood party on a Sunday. New neighbors moved in during the summer and they hosted. The theme was football, but I think it was really to show off the host's new gigantic TV. He's one of those guys, the biggest pick-up truck, the biggest back yard grill and now the biggest TV (my guess is that he also has the smallest cock). Anyway, it was all adults and it started around noon. Apparently there were football games on from noon until after midnight. 

The host had the basement decorated like a 13 year old (I don't like him - is it showing?) with posters and photos everywhere and game jerseys of his favorite teams. He had a keg of beer in the basement and another one out on his deck. There must have been sixty people there off and on through the day and evening. Some of the wives were down in the basement with the men rooting the teams on, and others were upstairs talking in the kitchen or watching chic flicks in the living room. The house was packed and there were people everywhere. 

Around 9PM the host caught me coming out of the upstairs bathroom (or maybe he had followed me and was waiting?). He was moderately drunk and he blocked my way down the hall. He very brazenly put his hands on my breasts and started to maul them. He was telling me that the men in the neighborhood had voted me the neighborhood MILF that they would all like to fuck. 

I don't mess around where I live so I removed his hands and told him never to touch me again or I would kick him solidly in the balls and then I went back downstairs to where hubby was watching football. I was tempted to grab hubby and leave, but thought "Fuck him! (the host) and decided that he wasn't going to intimidate me into running away from him. Hubby and I stayed another hour or so and then we went home. 

DECEMBER 

On a Friday we had our un-exciting holiday party thrown by the company. Nice food, not so good speeches by the big-wigs, no alcohol and no music. As soon as everyone had done the required ass kissing of the bosses we were off to the bars. 

We did three different bars, losing some people at one, picking up a few at another and finally the group was down to about ten and we went to someone's apartment. I don't even think the guy worked at our company. He must have been a friend of someone who does and had hooked up with us at one of the bars. 

It was a large loft apartment and he had roommates and they had mistletoe hanging everywhere so I pretty much made the rounds with the kissing even as more people were showing up. The booze was flowing, the music was nice and the lights were low. It was a fun party. 

Later I found myself sitting on a guy's lap. I didn't know him from the office, I didn't even know his name, but I was sitting on his lap and we were kissing like fourteen year olds. He had his hand inside my blouse and I was rubbing the lump in his trousers when he got a couple of fingers into me. I let him finger me for a minute or so, but it was uncomfortable since I still had my panties on. I stood up and took them off and dropped them on the floor and then sat back down on his lap and spread my legs to give him better access. All I was looking for was an orgasm from his fingers and I was going to repay him with a hand job. 

Our tongues were dueling and he had his fingers back in my pussy and I had just worked his dick out of his pants when suddenly he asked me to stand up so he could open his pants to get his zipper out of the way. I stood up and he pushed his pants down toward his knees and I went to sit back down and he grabbed me by the waist and pulled me down. I don't think he was trying to do it and I know for sure I wasn't trying, but when I hit his lap his cock went right into my wet pussy. I started to rise up, but he had his hands on my waist and he pulled me back down. I tried again and he pulled me back down again. Up, down, up, down, it was just like fucking. The third time when he pulled me down his cock rubbed my G-spot and I stopped trying to get away and I started riding him. 

I couldn't believe that I was doing it. On a couch in a room full of people I was riding the cock of a guy whose name I didn't even know. Every time I pushed down on him his cock would touch my G-spot and my body quivered with orgasms. I felt his stiff cock get even harder as he pushed up at me as I pushed down on him. I knew he would be cumming inside me soon. He wrapped his arms around me and rolled me over onto my back and started fucking me hard. Someone started sucking on my left breast and I moaned and shoved my pussy up at the guy. I heard a woman say, "You go girl" and another one say, "I wish I had the guts to do something like that." A mouth latched onto my right breast and I moaned again. Suddenly the guy groaned and he pushed deep inside me and I felt the pulsations of his cock as he dumped his sperm inside me. He pumped several more times before I felt him lift himself off me.  

===

I went to push the mouths away from my breasts so I could sit up, but before I could do it another guy crawled on top of me and another cock slid into my pussy. I looked up to see Steve, a guy I worked with looking down at me. He smiled and said, "You can't possibly know how bad I've wanted to do this for the last couple of years." 

Why fight it? Everyone in the room had watched me do the first guy and by now I was labeled a slut anyway. He pushed gently and entered my wet hole and then he started fucking me slowly with long, deep strokes. I lifted my ass slightly and felt him move even deeper into me. The mouths on my tits were making me moan and Steve began to pump faster and I loudly moaned as an orgasm washed over me. Steve grabbed my legs and lifted them up on his shoulders and he began to pound into me deep and hard. He slammed into me for what seemed like hours and I felt another orgasm building deep inside me and then I screamed, "OH MY GOD!" as I came harder than I could ever remember. I heard Steve gasp, "Here it comes baby" and I cried, "Give it to me, let it go, give it to me" and Steve pushed as deep in me as he could go and I felt him cum. 

As Steve was climbing off of me I heard some guy say, "Think she'll do all of us?" and another cock entered me. I didn't know this guy either, but he was balls deep in me before I even knew Steve was all the way out of the way and my legs went up and wrapped around him. I felt the strong cock pumping into my pussy and I moaned and I cried and I begged him to fuck me. My tits were being worked, my pussy was full and I looked around and saw several people standing around and watching me. I saw men taking off their pants and I knew they were going to fuck me too. Something nudged my cheek and I turned my head to look and there was a hard cock only an inch or so from my mouth. I didn't even look to see who it belonged to; I just opened my mouth and let it in. 

I was lost in lust. My entire universe consisted of the cock in my mouth and the cock in my pussy. I had never felt so alive, so aroused. The cock in my mouth throbbed and then released and I gulped and swallowed and at the same time I felt the cock in my pussy send a load deep into me. Two more cocks took their place and then two more and two more after that. Some of them I knew from work and some I'd never seen before. 

And then suddenly it was over. 

Everyone dressed and left, leaving me on the couch a sweaty, cum covered mess. I managed to get up and find the bathroom and I cleaned myself up. On my way back to the living room I passed by an open bedroom door and I looked in and saw the guy who had started it all. He was lying naked on his bed sleeping. He was lying on his back and I had an evil thought. I went into the bedroom, took off my undies and straddled his head. I concentrated on squeezing my muscles and was rewarded with a blob of cum falling from my pussy onto his face. I just wish he would have had his mouth open. I giggled, got off the bed and went home. 

It was three PM Saturday when I dragged myself into the house. Hubby took one look at me and asked: 

"What the hell happened to you?" 

"I got fucked sweetie, I got fucked real good." 

Nothing (extra-marital) has happened since that party. Is this enough for you to work with to do a story?

Authors note: More from Christina. I've told her that she could just as well send in the story herself, but for some reason she wants me to do it. As with BASW Christina (1) all I've had to do was make some minor changes to save her from herself. She keeps putting in information that would give her away to some one who knows her and reads the story. It isn't necessary that you read BASW Christina (1) to follow along, but it might make it more interesting.

Subject: Story 

Oh wow Bob, thank you so much for going through my story and taking out the things that might have identified me. I'm especially glad that you reworked the "Intern Party". If anyone I work with reads these kinds of stories and they read about that party the way I wrote it it would have been a dead give-a-way. They would know all the nasty things I'd done and especially about my pulling that train at the Christmas party!!!!! (giggle, giggle - just maybe they would be jealous). 

I ended my last to you rather abruptly. I came home from the Christmas party gangbang and told Gary that I had been really, really fucked and ended the story. There was more of course. I didn't have my coat off and Gary was pressing me for details, but I was whipped and all I wanted to do was crawl into bed and go to sleep. But fair is fair so I told Gary he could follow me to the bedroom and: 

"While you see what it is like to follow ten or twelve men into your wife's pussy I'll tell you what happened until I fall asleep." 

I didn't of course - fall asleep I mean. Gary is a marvelous lover and I don't care what other people say there IS a difference between making love and just having sex. I'd had sex for several hours that night and while it was good (hell! It was GREAT!!) it didn't give me what I got when Gary made love to me. The man played me like a violin and when he was done I fell asleep with a huge smile on my face. 

I don't really need to say this because I'm sure you know from the last stuff I sent you, but Gary DID NOT leave me alone all weekend. Thank God I had children to take care of; it was the only way I could get a break from the man. 

The rest of December was fairly quiet. Things did get a little sticky at work for a while. Steve, one of the men who had taken part in my X-mas party gangbang kept after me to get it on with him again. I didn't want to get into anything steady with anyone from work and I kept saying no. Finally I straight out told him to leave me alone. To soften the blow I told him that I only get wild and crazy like that at Christmas time and that if he were around come the next X-mas party we would see. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Gary and I attended a New Years Eve party and I think that he hoped I would sneak off with someone, but I had to disappoint him. The X-mas party proved that I could be a slut. Hell, let's be honest here; the last six months showed I was a slut, but even if I was a slut I wasn't going to start spending the majority of my free time on my back. I didn't tell Gary this, because I kind of liked keeping him charged up, but I was going to limit my extracurricular activities to once a month and even then only if I really liked the guy. 

January First Friday 

I told myself that it came too close on the heels of my X-mas party train ride for me to let anything happen and I planned on being super good. I did dance with Steve and I did go out to his car with him, but only to talk. I really wanted him to understand that I did like him, but that I wasn't going to play around with the people I worked with. He said he understood and somehow a minute later we were necking and that led to him fingering me which led to my giving him a hand job which I ended up finishing with my mouth. As I used my panties to clean up the mess I asked him to not even ask me to dance anymore. 

"I really do need to work on being good for my hubby." 

I guess he understood where I was coming from since he stayed away from me after that. 

Nothing more happened in January, much to Gary's disappointment. I did have several opportunities to have something happen, but I just didn't feel 'the spark' with any of the guys. I do want to make Gary happy and give him what he wants, BUT I have to at least enjoy doing it.

February First Friday 

Five of us girls stopped at a new lounge. Karen (you remember Karen - from the Intern Party? Slut, slut slut!!) had been in the place the night it opened and she said it was a real fun place. My God! It was one huge meat market (and some pretty good-looking meat at that). We had no sooner sat down than Karen said: 

"See that tall, hunky looking redhead at the bar? He doesn't know it yet, but he just got lucky. He's mine girls." 

The waitress came and took our drink order and when she brought it back to us she waved away payment. 

"The men at table twelve picked up the tab." 

"Which is table twelve?" Karen asked and the waitress pointed. We looked that way and saw five guys who could have come straight from the pages of GQ magazine (or Playgirl). Karen giggled and said, "Oh well, easy come, easy go." 

"What does that mean?" I asked. 

"It means the redhead is history. I'm going for the blond in the sports coat" and she raised her glass to the men as a thank you for the drinks. Immediately, almost as if he'd heard her, the blond in the sports coat got up and came over to us. He introduced himself as Marv and said: 

"I'm a strong believer in coincidence. In this entire place there are only two groups of five and I think we should take advantage of that and put our tables together." 

Without asking the rest of us Karen said, "That's a great idea" and suddenly we were a party of ten. For the next hour and a half it was drinks and dancing and gradually pairs started to occur. Janice and Bill began dancing together exclusively. Next it was Marcie and Hank and then Bev and Joe. 

That's when things started to get uncomfortable for me. You know that 'spark' that I never felt in January? I was feeling it that night, but it was with Marv and what's more, he seemed interested in me. Given Karen's statement that she was "going for the blond in the sports coat" (who just happened to be Marv) I was between a rock and a hard place. For the first time since December I'd found someone I liked enough to give Gary what he wanted, but if I did I could screw up my relationship with Karen and I didn't want that. I'd just about made up my mind to call it a night and go home when Karen leaned over and whispered in my ear: 

"You slut! I hate you, but go ahead. I'm not interested in Carl (the other man at our table), but I notice that the redhead hasn't hooked up yet. Maybe he was fated for me all along." 

She patted my hand and got up and headed for the redhead who was about to get lucky. I had one thing that I had to do and I might have been jumping the gun since Marv had yet to say anything, but I needed to call Gary. 

"Hi honey." 

"I'm just calling to let you know that I love you." 

"Well, yeah, kinda. Would you mind terribly if I was late tonight? 

"Really, really late honey." 

"Of course that's what it means. Is it okay with you?" 

"I don't know. He hasn't made a move yet, but if he does I wanted to know you were okay with it." 

"You know I will honey, every last little detail (and then I giggled and said, "I hope it's not too little."). 

When I got back to the table Janice asked, "Where did you go?" 

"Called my hubby to check in" and then I looked right at Marv and said, "I told him I might be late - really, really late." and Marv smiled at me. 

I followed him to his apartment and he led me straight to the bedroom. I hadn't been in his apartment two minutes and I was kneeling on the floor in from of him sucking his cock. He tried to pull me up and get me on the bed, but I wouldn't let him. 

"I want to get the quick one out of the way and then we will move to the bed." 

I licked, sucked and played with his balls and was rewarded with several spurts of his cum and then we got up on the bed and he moved into a sixty-nine over me. As he dove into my pussy I captured his cock with my mouth and went to work at bringing his cock back to life. He brought me to two orgasms with his mouth and then he swung around and I spread my legs wide for him. I screamed with pleasure as he speared his cock into me and then we sucked and fucked until we both fell asleep. 

I woke up at five-thirty and took one look at his limp cock lying across his leg and I couldn't resist going after it with my mouth. He woke up, got up and then took me doggie. He gave me one very nice orgasm and then it was time for me to run home and get ready to go to work. 

Gary had already left for work by the time I got home and I felt bad about that, but I made it up to him that night (and almost every night for the next two weeks). 

The only other major thing that happened in February was not sexual (at least not just then). My department head asked me to have lunch with him. We talked about our department and he asked me if I knew of anyway to make some of the things we did any easier and I gave him some of my thoughts and then we went back to work. Two days later he called me into his office. 

"Chris, this is strictly confidential and you can't mention it to anyone until the announcement is made, but we have bought out XXXXXXX Industries. They have six facilities and we are putting together a conversion team to visit each facility, see how they are set up and then get them on the same page with us. It will mean a lot of travel and overnight stays for a couple of months. I want you to be our department's representative on the team. Are you interested?" 

Was I interested? My God, was I ever! Ten years with the company and I thought that no one even knew I existed and now I find out they think enough of me to entrust me with a project that important. I could have climbed over his desk and kissed him (or under it to do you know what). I walked out of his office on air. It is a great feeling to know that your worth is recognized. 

Gary's response to the news was predictable. His eyes lit up with all the possibilities, all of the chances I would have to feed his fetish. I hated breaking the bad news to him to him, but I told him that would not be the setting in which to have any screw-ups, either work wise or personal. That it was a big enough thing that I expected it to affect my career and I had to make sure that it affected it in a positive way. I told Gary that on the trips I was going to be a good little girl and be as straight as a nun. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

March First Friday 

First Friday in March was a non-event. We were so busy mapping out what the conversion team was going to be doing that by the time I got off work it was too late to join the rest of the crew for drinks. 

The conversion team is made up of four people; John from Human Resources, Mike from Marketing, Glen from Engineering and myself representing Finance. I was sorry that I'd told Gary that I was going to keep things on a professional level because Glen and Mike are hunks and John isn't bad (for a man with male pattern baldness and a potbelly). 

Our first trip was to Toledo, Ohio. We spent the first day doing a preliminary audit and that evening we went back to the hotel to clean up and then we met in the hotel dining room for dinner. After dinner the four of us went to the lounge to have an after dinner drink or two and to listen to the live band. Glen asked me to dance and I said no. I wanted to dance, but as far as our little group was concerned I wanted to keep things on a professional level. 

An hour and several drinks went by, during which time I also turned down John and Mike when they asked me to dance. Then Glen came up to me again and said: 

"Are you going to loosen up for us or be a tight ass the entire trip?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"John and I have both seen you with your hair down and quite frankly we hoped it would happen again. In fact, that's all we've thought about since you were named to the team." 

"What are you saying?" 

"John and I were both at Kevin's apartment the night of the company Christmas party. He was with his wife and couldn't get loose from her to get a taste of you. I was there with my girlfriend and she wouldn't even let me look in your direction. We were both hoping that we would get our chance on this trip." 

"You were both there? Oh shit! I thought Steve was the only one there and I swore him to silence. How many others know?" 

"John and I haven't said a word about it to anyone because we didn't want to blow our chances. If Steve kept quiet about it than no one else knows." 

"Not even Mike? Are you sure you didn't smile and tell him he might get lucky on this trip depending?" 

"No, Mike doesn't have a clue." 

"Damn Glen, I don't know. I wanted to keep these trips on a professional level. I'm hoping to get a promotion out of this deal." 

"We all are Chris. Believe me, John and I won't tell a soul. Remember that seminar we attended in New York when they talked about team building exercises? We are a team and we are going to be together for another couple of months and I can't think of a better way to build team spirit." 

The bottom line is that three drinks later I was naked on Glen's bed, legs spread wide and watching Glen, John and Mike stripping off their clothes (yes- I told them to bring Mike - it would be easier to include him than to try and hide it from him). On the way to Glen's room I had stopped at mine, got my diaphragm and put it in (I know, I know, if I planned on being good why did I have it with me - what can I say?) I also called home and told Gary what was going to be happening and told him I would leave my cell phone on so he could listen in. Once in Glen's room I put my purse with the live cell phone on the bedside stand. If the battery held out Gary would get to hear the whole thing (it did, but I didn't know for sure until I called Gary the next morning). 

The three men moved onto the bed with me and I moaned as three sets of hands roamed all over my body. My nipples were tweaked, fingers probed my pussy and one pushed into my ass. I loved the feel of the hands on my body and if I could have I would have purred like a cat. I moaned, "Oh God yes" and hoped that Gary heard it. 

The bodies shifted on the bed and Glen moved between my legs. "Oh Jesus yes Glen, put your cock in me, fuck me honey, fuck my brains out." 

My body was on fire from the busy hands. Mike lowered his head and took my right nipple between his teeth and I moaned. Glen's cock lanced into my pussy and I pushed up at him. 

"Oh yes, oh God yes" I cried out loud enough for Gary to hear over the cell phone, "I need this, I need this, I need to be fucked. Fuck me Glen, fuck me hard." 

I heard John say, "Open your mouth honey" and I did and he pushed his cock past my lips and toward the back of my mouth. I swirled my tongue around it and took him as deep as I could without gagging. Glen was sawing in and out in my pussy and Mike was working on my tits and I felt my first orgasm starting to build and I moaned in pleasure. I had my legs clamped around Glen's waist and my nails were digging into his back. Glen began to gasp for breath and I heard a little groan and I felt him erupt inside me and that triggered my orgasm. It was so strong that I almost bucked Glen off of me. He slid his cock back and forth a few more times until he was too soft to penetrate and then he got out of the way. 

John pulled out of my mouth and moved down to take Glen's place between my legs and Mike moved from my tits to my mouth. Mike must have been on edge because almost as soon as I took him in my mouth I felt his cock throb and grow and suddenly he was spurting his juices toward the back of my mouth. I gulped and swallowed and moaned loudly around his cock as John shoved his cock into me. 

"Get em up again Chris baby, get me ready again" Mike whispered and I locked my lips around his shaft and went to work. 

John fucked me hard for several minutes and then he moaned and shot his load into me and Mike left my mouth and moved down to take my pussy. 

"Oh God yes" I cried out as Mike shoved his cock into me. "Fuck me lover, fuck me hard, fuck me hard and make me cum." 

For the next hour the three men took turns fucking me and having their cocks sucked as I was loudly vocal so Gary could hear. I told the guys I needed to take a potty break and I grabbed my purse and headed into the bathroom. I took the cell phone and said: 

"Are you there lover? 

"Can you hear it all right?" 

"Good baby, because it is all for you." 

"Okay, love you too. Got to go now, they are waiting for me." 

When I returned to the bed all three were again at the same time for the first time since we started our little fuck-fest. 

"What now?" I asked. 

"We want to three hole you" Glen said. 

I looked at the three hard cocks and said, "Okay, but I want John to be the one to use my ass." 

I picked John for my ass because he had the skinniest cock. It was long, but in girth it was the size of a BallPark frank. Glen lay down on his back and I lowered myself down on him and moaned as he filled me. He pulled me down so I was almost lying on his chest and John moved up behind me. He smeared my butt hole with some of the cum leaking out of my pussy and worked a finger into my ass. He worked it around for a bit and then added a second finger. Finally I felt the head of his cock push against my rosebud. For Gary's benefit I called out: 

"Oh yes, oh yes, push your cock in my ass, fuck my ass baby, fuck my ass." 

I squealed like a pig when as John's cock pushed into me and I pushed my ass back at him and then he and Glen started fucking me. As soon as they got a rhythm going Mike stepped in front of me and I took his cock in my mouth. After that I was pretty much a mindless fuck toy as the three men banged away at me. All three took a shot at my ass before we all fell asleep exhausted. 

I woke up in the morning with John sucking on my right breast, Glen fingering my pussy and Mike dragging his hard cock back and forth across my mouth. Believe me, starting the day out airtight is not a bad way to go. It damned sure leads to a healthy appetite at the breakfast table. 

Over breakfast we talked and I told them that as much as I'd loved it I wasn't going to let it happen again on that trip. 

"We have five more trips to make and I'll do it once on each trip, but only as long as you don't let anyone else know about it. Agreed?" 

They all agreed and we finished breakfast, got on out to the Toledo plant and got to work. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When the trip was over and I got home Gary was all over me like white on rice and he has not - HAS NOT! - left me alone. The one thing I thought sure to happen hasn't. I was sure that once I gave Gary his fantasy he would hit me with: 

"Okay, now it is my turn to have some strange" but he hasn't. I don't know what I'll do if he does. I don't mind spreading my legs to give him what he wants, but I'm not that way - I DON'T SHARE! If Gary strayed I don't know if I'd cut his dick off or not, but he would damned sure find out just how pissed I was. 

Hubby accepted an invitation from our asshole neighbor to watch the Final Four on his gigantic big screen TV. You remember? The dipshit who mauled my tits and told me I was the neighborhood MILF? Well, after the games were over he was in the hall when I came out of the bathroom (again!) and I told him if he touched my tits I'd scream loud enough to wake up the neighborhood. He put on a pout and told me what a poor sport I was, how he was just kidding, and couldn't I take a joke, blah, blah, blah. But he didn't touch my tits.  

===

I've never mentioned ANYTHING about him to Gary. The guys all get together to talk about grass (the green kind) and lawn tractors and snow blowers and sports and whatever, and sometimes play poker and I didn't want to mess that up for Gary by putting something like that between them. Of course if it ever got bad I would tell his wife and then I'd tell Gary and the entire neighborhood, but for now I can handle it. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Sorry, nothing to report about April First Friday. A group of us went to Applebee's and after pre-dinner and post-dinner margaritas I got pretty wasted. After everybody else left I went and sat at the bar and had a couple of coffees while I flirted with the bartender. He offered to drive me home, but I was too tired to wait for the end of his shift so he called me a cab and stuffed his phone number in my purse. He was kind of hunky and I didn't throw his number away. 

Today I took our son to the "Y" for free swim time and met a very nice father who was there with his daughter. He was charming and the time flew and we exchanged numbers so we could set up another swim date. Hmmm...

Author's Note: This story is a continuation of three other stories. Some time back I received an email from a fan telling me how much she liked my stories. A week later she sent me another email commenting on another story of mine. Then she said that she wished she could write: 

* 

"I've turned into one of your slut wives. If I could write I could probably make a story about how I've become what my husband calls a "Hot Wife." 

I told her to send me the particulars and I'd see if I could do her story for her. The result was Becoming A Slut Wife - Christina. She liked the story and sent me more on what she'd done since sending me the first batch and the result was BASW - Christina (2). 

She was so happy with that one that she sent me a recap of her sex life before she got married to her husband Gary and I turned it into a story called Chris - The Wild Years. 

I have stayed in touch with Christina and she has kept me pretty much up to date as far as her "hot wife" activities are concerned. You would have to say that she has 'lost a step' when you compare what she does now with what she did during "The Wild Years", but to her way of thinking she has just become more selective and circumspect. 

I guess I'm something like an online diary for her. Well maybe a little more than that - I admit to being in lust with her (she has sent me a picture and I can honestly say "She is to die for") even though we have never met and never will meet - and she certainly seems to be one of my biggest fans, if not the biggest. I receive two or three emails a week from her telling me what might happen, what could have happened, and in some cases what did happen. 

Christina is not as big a slut as her husband and I wish her to be; he because it is what he craves and I because of the story material it would supply and the fantasies of mine it would feed. In addition to recounting what she tells me I have been able to make a story or three out of some of the things she tells me (see "Pillow Talk"). 

This story is a departure from the format of the first two BASW Christina stories in that she wrote them and I merely edited them and then posted them for her. Chris - The Wild Years was written out, sent to me and I put it in story form. This story is different in that I am writing it from material that the two of us have provided. What I have done here is take our email correspondence from April 8, 2006 to August 10, 2006 and assemble them into a story. With one exception this story is pure Christina although she didn't write it. The one exception is where I took what I laughingly call "artistic license" with something she said. It embellishes the story a tad, but in no way detracts from it. 

When I first posted Becoming A Slut Wife - Christina I had no idea that there would be a second story and then a third. I don't know if this fourth story will be the end of the Christina saga or merely the next chapter. One can only hope.

Here it is sweetie. It still needs to be proof read, spell checked and I want your comments before I put the final polish on it.

Hello Dear, 

I wouldn't change a thing! I loved it! And, again, for me, I still get off remembering the post-prom train I pulled! Damn, I'm a slut! 

Of course, after reading it, I had to wonder how it could work so well with hubby after revealing all my secrets??? Of course, I didn't tell him all in one sitting - I didn't want to see him have a heart attack. 

Sorry, but nothing to report about First Friday. A group of us went to Applebee's and after pre-dinner and post-dinner Margaritas I got pretty wasted. After everybody else left I went to the bar and had a couple of coffees while I flirted with the young bartender. He offered to drive me home and he had a nice bulge in his trousers and I was tempted, but I was too tired to wait for his shift to end so he called me a cab and stuffed his number in my purse. 

Now today I took our son to the "Y" for free swim time and met a very nice father who was there with his daughter. He was charming and the time flew and we exchanged numbers so we could set up another swim date. Hmmmm...... 

Love, Chris

Hi sweetie, 

Couldn't sleep so here I am at almost three in the morning banging away at my keyboard working on another story. Is Gary only interested in my cheating wife stories, or is he open for anything I do. Just asking so I don't offend. Attached are two that have not yet been posted anywhere. 

Thinking of you doing nasty things

Hello Dear, 

Gary will read whatever you send sweetie, he likes your writing almost as much as I do. The bosses are talking about another business trip the week of the 24th. So keep that in mind if you don't hear from me for a day or two that week. I'll remind you before I go. 

Love, Chris 

Wednesday, April 20 

Hello sweet Chris, 

Once again you catch me at my keyboard hard at work trying to satisfy my adoring publics thirst for whatever the hell it is that I do. I've attached what I'm working on - see if you can figure out where I'm going with it. Here is a hint - I don't have a clue! It has already changed direction twice since I sat down at the keyboard. Where do you think it should go? 

Lets see now; you like my stories and I get a "Be still my beating heart" when you find out I have a pond and a waterfall in my backyard. Would finding out I'm a damned good cook and take care of two-thirds of the meals around here make you want to run to me? (Yeah, you can bring Gary). 

Ready to meet you at the airport, Bob 

Thursday, April 21 

Hi My Sweet Man, 

I'll admit I have always found a man in an apron sexy. I'm lucky to have one of my own. With the crazy hours I work hubby always has something interesting for dinner. Me, on the other hand - I'm not much good in the kitchen (if you are talking about food that is). 

Gee, I'm no good with the cooking or outside work, hubby changed WAY more than his share of poopy diapers, I hate to clean and do the laundry, I work long hours and I love to shop for shoes. I'm beginning to wonder why hubby keeps me around! Oh, yeah, now I remember! 

Where to take Toni? You're the writer Sweetheart. Maybe the boss keeps her just for himself, and as long as she is available to him the husband has a job. I think you have already done the "company whore thing". The interesting thing would be what was the catalyst for Toni thinking that her marriage was over? Did the boss want her to do gangbangs or clients and she said no so he is going to tell the husband in the exit interview? Was the boss removed for some reason and she just realized she wanted more than one man in her life and she didn't want to hurt her husband by cheating? What happened that she was ready to split? Again dearest, you are the writer and it is for you to come up with the ideas and I can't wait to read what you come up with. 

Love, Chris

Hi there sweet author, 

Well, I'm back home and resting. I spent yesterday reacquainting myself with my two guys, I really missed them. Nothing sexy happened on this trip, but I did meet a couple of part-time kids (and I do mean kids - still in college). While we were working together we had some laughs and some minor teasing and there were some looks at me like I was a MILF (I am you know). Anyway, we will be returning to Atlanta in a couple of weeks. We do have a couple of more offices in the area to visit and my two fans offered to take me to some non-touristy spots on my return trip. 

Hmmm..... 

Did I mention they were young boys? 

Love you, Chris 

Tuesday, May 2 

Hello dearest, 

Guess who called me today? Yup, one of the college kids from Atlanta. He just wanted to say "Hi" and that he enjoyed working with me. He repeated his offer to show me the non-touristy sights on my return trip. See what I mean about those red-blooded, over-testoseroned young boys????? 

Love, Chris 

Wednesday, May 3 

Hey sexy lady, 

Give me a hint sweetums, whatcha gonna do with the college boys? Lead them on, ignore them or make Gary happy? I know you told your hubby you were going to be pure on your business trips, but you already shot that one in the butt on your last trip. You already promised them once each trip. Gonna add the boys to the mix? Or do them separate? (Older woman, younger men - something about that just calls out to me). 

Love, Bob 

Friday, May 5 

Dearest Bob, 

What am I going to do with the college boys? Believe me, you are not the first guy to ask me that. I told hubby that if it could be arranged that--IF-- something happens, it has to happen totally disconnected from the work related matters of the trip. I'm not saying no, I'm say that we will see. I WILL keep them separate from my associates. They already know I'm a slut, but they don't need to know how big a one. 

Love you, 

Your slutty Chris 

Saturday, May 6 

Hi there don't I wish you were my slutty Chris, 

Oh to be a college boy when Christina comes to visit. The story of my life - never in the right place at the right time. 

See what you think about the attached. A mixed bag to be sure, but what can you expect from my warped mind. In retrospect I should have let "Daniel (1)" stand alone, but I bowed to the pressure of emails and feedback. My bad. 

Bob 

Sunday, May 7 

Hi My Guy #3, 

(Sorry, Gary and my little guy have to be I and 2). 

Gary and I both liked your set up on the "Pub Crawl" and we are looking forward to the rest of it. 

I went out with the crowd on Friday night, but dinner and drinks was the extent of it. We are in a Chilli's/Applebee's/TGIF rut - with no band or dancing and I didn't feel up to finding some lounge on my own. Maybe next time! God, I've been so good I'm boring myself (and hubby, and I'm sure, you!)! 

Your slut, Chris 

Friday, May 12 

Dearest Author' 

I was told this morning that we will be returning to Atlanta next week (Wed thru Sat). I called Matt (one of the college boys) and told him and said I hope we could work out that tour he promised me. He seemed pleased. I wonder why? 

Love, Chris 

Monday, May 15 

Hi Long Distance Lover, 

I know I was a bad girl and didn't write to you yesterday, but it was Mother's Day and I took an entire day away from any kind of keyboard. 

I'm leaving for my trip Wednesday morning and I will try and stay in touch as much as possible. I called Matt again and told him I would do all I could to get away for a tour. 

Love, Chris 

Tuesday, May 16 

Dearest Bob, 

Well, I'm leaving tomorrow, returning Saturday, so don't get mad if I don't check in every day - just know that I'm thinking of checking in every day. 

Yours, Chris 

Wednesday, May 17 

Hi there sexy correspondent, 

Sorry for missing yesterday. Bad day all around. Nothing worked right and I ended up working from 3 AM to 9:30 PM and I went straight to bed when I got home. 

By the time you get this you will be on the road or at your evening accommodations and depending on how things go you may not get time to read it (I haven't forgotten your possible tour with the college boys nor have I forgotten your promise to your co-workers). 

If you have to stay in and be a good girl I have attached a couple to give you something to read. 

Thinking of you doing the NASTY, Bob 

Thursday, May 18 

Dear man who loves my slutty side, 

Nasty does not even begin to cover it!!! No dinner, no drinks, no dancing, they just led me off the elevator and into Glen's room and the games began. I'll tell you all about when I sent you the tale of my trip. 

Well, I'm set up for my "date" tonight. I told my co-workers that I had a college friend in town and we were going to get together to chat about old times (I wasn't actually lying, the boys are in college and I was friendly with them last time we were here). In fact, I'll be taking a taxi to a nearby Starbucks and meeting Matt for dinner and my "tour." Unfortunately his co- worker Vince is in the middle of exams and can't make it. Stay tuned for breaking news. 

Love, slutty Chris 

Monday, May 22 

Hello Dearest, 

Just a short note of "Hi" right now. You know what that first day back at your desk is like. Let us just say I had an incredible trip! I got together with Matt on two occasions and had a fantastic time. I can't wait until I'm able to write it out for you and tell you all about it. 

Thinking of you, Chris 

Sunday, May 28 

Hello dearest Bob, 

THANK GOD for Sundays and holidays!!! My life has been a bitch this week. Monday was a long day because it was my first day back from our trip so there was a lot of catch-up to do. Then all hell broke loose on Tuesday (something big with the company, but very hush-hush) and the earliest I got home all week was a little after 9 PM Tuesday through Friday. I worked almost eleven hours yesterday!!! 

My wonderful hubby let me sleep in late, made me a wonderful breakfast and took our son out for the day. Is he a prince, or what? And this less than a week after I told him I got gangbanged and then fucked the balls of a young man on my trip last week. Then I spent most of the day in a bubble bath pampering myself with coffee, the Sunday paper and junk TV. 

I PROMISE you will have the details of my tryst BEFORE I go back to work on Tuesday. 

I'm still here dear, please don't be mad at me for not staying in touch. 

Love, Chris 

Friday, June 2 

My dearest, dearest Bob, 

I hope there isn't anything wrong. Maybe you are just mad at me for being such a terrible e-mail friend, and I don't blame you. Since I got back from my trip my life has gone into the toilet. I worked even more hours this week than last. I even got paged on Monday (Memorial Day!!) to check on some numbers my boss had sent me and to "just" check them out (gee, it only took two and a half- hours). 

On top of everything else I got my period (too much info?) so along with tired I've been mean, bitchy and teary and not felling sexy in the least. I know, I know, WAY TOO MUCH INFO. I don't know how Gary can stand being married to me and I wouldn't care if he walked out. Of course that's just the hormones talking. 

I even started my tale of sordid sex on my trip, but I tried being a JPB and writing a story instead of just giving you the facts. I will get it to you dear (if you still care about it). 

Oh fuck! There's the phone again. 

Wednesday, June 7 

Dearest Author, 

Well dear, I finally got something written up, but don't look for a JPB story. It really was a great trip and the sex was fantastic. Sorry I took so long to get it to you. Some of us don't have the muse you do. 

Love me? Chris.

The Trip 

Because the guys on the team (John from Human Resources, Glen from Engineering, and Mike from Marketing) were focused on their golf outing we were busy from the moment we got off the airplane Wednesday morning and into the rental car. We checked into the hotel, dropped our bags off in our rooms and were off to visit our first field office. We visited one office in the morning and two in the afternoon which put us ahead of schedule. As we got out of the rental car John reminded me of my promise and I was hustled off the elevator and into Greg's room. (I found out over breakfast that because golf was deemed a little more important than me they got me out of the way Wednesday so they could rest up for golf). I gladly excused myself and went into the ladies room and used my cell to call Matt to see if we were still on for our Thursday night "date." We were. 

{I need to back up here and set the stage. I met Matt and his friend Vince on my first trip to Atlanta back in May. They are part-timers in one of the offices I visited and the three of us spent a lot of time together in one of the tiny back offices checking numbers, updating software and verifying security. We started kidding around and after a while the joking got a little flirty. I didn't mind. At 33 it's nice when a couple of college guys flirt with you. Over dinner, to which our team treated their office, one of the managers mentioned he belonged to some country club with a championship golf course and he invited us to go golfing with him. My five teammates reacted like they had been given free tickets and invited to the Super Bowl. They said we would be coming back to town in two or three weeks and would love to play the course. I said I didn't golf and then Matt and Vince offered to give me a tour of the town, avoiding all the tourist traps and showing me the "real" Atlanta. I spoke to both Matt and Vince on the phone over the next three weeks while the return trip was being set up.} 

On Thursday we finished early (I guess the guys wanted a good nights sleep). Not wanting the rest of the team to see me meeting Matt (Vince had just finished exams and was out of state on a job interview) I took a taxi from the hotel and met him at a Starbucks. He told me to dress casual so I was wearing a red tank top, snug (but not tight) jeans, and red slip on wedges. I was also wearing my tiniest black bra and panty set. 

Matt drove for a while and we parked at a building that looked like it belonged on the end of a dock somewhere. It was supposed to resemble a picturesque sea side shanty. Matt grabbed a six pack of Bud from a cooler in the trunk and led me inside to introduce me to steamed crabs. It was love at first taste. 

After we finished eating he drove to a bustling neighborhood that seemed to have a bar in every building on the street and he led me into one of them. For the next hour we drank, yelled over the music and danced. After a while he took my hand and led me out of that bar and toward another. I pulled him to a stop and on the crowded sidewalk I pulled him close to me and said: 

"You don't have to get me drunk Matt. In fact, it will probably be a lot better if we are not" and then I kissed him hard. 

In an instant we were back in his car and I asked, "Where to?" 

"How about my place?" 

"Will we be alone?" 

"I don't know. I have two roommates and one or both of them could be at home or they could both be out." 

Not in the mood for entertaining a crowd I told him to take me back to my hotel. I think he was worried that I was calling it an evening and he brightened up when I told him to drop me off, park the car and meet me in my room. I'm surprised he didn't get stopped for speeding! 

Our team's rooms were spread out so I didn't have anyone I knew in an adjoining room. Matt knocked on my door in what seemed like seconds after I got there and seconds after that we were both naked and on the bed. The sex was good --very good. He was young and had a nice hard cock and he liked to kiss and he loved to eat pussy, so how could it be bad? 

I was keyed up, wound up tight as all I had thought about for two weeks was having a wild time with Matt and Vince. It hadn't helped any that Gary kept after me asking what I was going to do. Anyway, I was so wound up that I skipped the preliminaries, pushed Matt down on the bed and climbed on top of him and dropped myself down. I was so wet with eagerness that I didn't have a lot of trouble getting the job done --three pushes and I had all of him in me. 

And then I rode him, God did I ever ride him. I couldn't remember ever before being in such a sexual frenzy. I came twice before he told me he was going to cum and then I rammed myself down on him and felt him let go. God it was good. 

We fucked and suck late into the night. When we fell asleep one of us would wake up and then wake up the other and then we would go at it again. In the morning he ran out for some McDonald's breakfasts and then we fucked again until I had to shower, get dressed and meet my team in the lobby for the last office visit.  

===

One nice thing was during one of our many breaks Matt said that I was very pretty, smart, nice and funny. "Not sexy?" I asked. He said that I was beyond sexy. He said that I was beyond sexy. He said that a guy could look at a sexy woman and enjoy the sight, but when a guy looked at me all he wanted to do was fuck me. He said Vince had said the same thing and that after we had finished in his office and left his office manager admitted that he wanted to fuck me. I told Matt he had learned well for his young age (21) and there would be many, many women in his future if he could continue to throw a line like that with a straight face. 

The team (well, except for me) was all excited. They had such a good time that Charlie (the manager) asked them if they would like to go another eighteen the next day and the guys were all for it. As soon as the guys had left for the golf course I called Matt to ask if he was available for a repeat performance. He was and we did. Our second get together wasn't quite as frantic as the first. I started out by giving Matt a nice leisurely blow job (did I ever tell you I give great head?) and then he did his best to make me wake up anyone in a five block radius who might have been sleeping (did I tell you I was a screamer?) and then we did re-runs for the rest of the day and all night. For an old broad (well my 33 compared to his 21 did make me an "older woman") there is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- that can compare with having a young guy - an Energizer Bunny - doing his best to drive you down through the mattress over and over and over -- well, you get the picture. 

On Sunday morning I had to race to shower, get dressed and pack, but it was worth it. I almost dreaded going home. I know my Gary!! Once I described my trip to him he would be after and past experience had shown that he wouldn't leave me alone for weeks. I'd be walking bow-legged by the following Wednesday. 

Well Dear, there you have it. I hope it was worth the wait and that you enjoy reading it. 

Love, Chris

Sunday, June 11 

Hi sweetums, 

You never said - anything happen on June's First Friday? Maybe a sidelong glance at some young stud even if nothing came of it? 

Monday, June 12 

Dearest Bob, 

I didn't tell you about Friday because I didn't have one. Work was too crazy. Besides, I feel I've been naughty enough recently to last hubby (and you) for a while. But...There is always July 7th to look forward to. 

Saturday, July 1 

Dear sexy lady, 

Hope you are enjoying your holiday weekend. Are you going to be able to take Monday off and make a four dayer out of it? 

As I was typing this a message from Gary came in telling me he left you at a neighborhood party. I know it is a little too close to home for you, but I do hope you did a little something on the evil side, even if it was only a little teasing. 

You have never said - have you ever considered letting Gary watch? 

Sunday, May 2 

Oh damn it Bob, 

Hubby told you that?!! The boy just can't keep a secret. Did he tell you that he was SOOOO obvious volunteering to take our son home and then making suggestions in my ear? 

It wasn't a neighborhood party, it was the whole developments 30th anniversary so over 100 households were invited. The deepest street in the development is a cul-de-sac and it was closed off to traffic. They had everything! Inflatable water slides and jumping rooms for kids, a local (and very bad) band, fireworks, etc., etc. Everyone brought something. We took chips, brownies and ten pounds of Italian sausage (no, not that kind of Italian sausage!). There must have been fifty grills cooking, ten kegs tapped and enough food to feed half of Africa. It was a blast. 

When hubby left I was at a picnic table with 5 other women I had never met before and all of us were earning the hangovers we have today. We were just chatting about the hubbies-kids-careers-houses thing. Around ten some guys (really cute guys at that) came by and said there was dancing inside one of the houses on the next street and that the house was air-conditioned. Three of us decided to go see what was going on. The house was packed, the lights were out and the music was loud Two single guys had bought it to fix up and flip and there was hardly any furniture so there was a lot of dancing room, but if it was air conditioned you couldn't tell be me. 

The dancing was close and there were hands roaming everywhere. My boobs got mauled and one guy even slid his hands up the leg of my shorts. The kissing got pretty intense pretty fast. The guy who got his hand in my shorts took his cock out and put my hand on it. I was stroking him when I looked over his shoulder and saw one of the women I had been at the table with over in a corner on her knees with a cock in her mouth - and it wasn't her husbands!! And two guys were standing there, watching or lining up - I couldn't tell. But it was a wake up for me. I was too close to home. I dropped the cock I had in my hand, exercised some discretion and got the hell out of there. Hubby was not happy with my decision, but he said he understood (I know he didn't - he wouldn't mind if I did it on the front lawn if he could watch). 

As far as hubby watching ... we have discussed it of course, and that night on the beach seemed to show that he probably wouldn't freak out...but...I've only misbehaved a few times within the last 12-14 months and there really hasn't been an opportunity for him to watch. We both agreed that we wouldn't be comfortable doing it in our own home, even if our son wasn't there. He's happy to HEAR about my adventures, but we are both in a sexy mood when I'm sharing them with him. I'm not sure if it happened if I would be performing for the guy or for hubby or if it would matter. So, I guess you can see by this muddle of an answer that we are probably not ready for that....yet. 

Yes, I took Monday off. No work until Wednesday. 

Sunday, July 9 

Dear Bob' 

Nothing exciting here. I know it was First Friday, but 8 of us (6 women and two guys) went to a charity event where we tasted a lot of microbreweries' beer. Yum!! I think I like the ales best --but it will probably require further investigation and testing. Other than that I behaved like the good little girl that I am. 

+++++ 

{ A couple of emails either got deleted or lost so a quick recap is necessary for the following emails to be understood. My brother, who Christina has labeled Just Plain Brother, and his wife Karen came to Colorado to visit and while they were here we spent a weekend at a cabin in the mountains. My sister in law is a total fox and I have lusted after her since the day my brother introduced us and Karen knows it and she teases me unmercifully. Once, at a birthday party she flashed her tits at me just to see me get flustered. My wife is well aware of the situation between Karen and me and she thinks it is hilarious and so I also get teased from that end. I mentioned Just Plain Brother's visit and told Christina about the dynamic between Karen and me and I also mentioned that the only reason I haven't taken a shot at Karen is that I have a "No Family" rule. I also have a Wife Has To Go First Rule. My fantasy has always been to see her with another man and my wife and I have given each other permission to play with others, but I won't go first. I call it my self defense mechanism. 

+++++ 

Monday, July 17 

Hi sweet Chris, 

As far as I know I was the only one at the party she flashed. On a scale of one to ten I give her tits a nine. They are quite possible tens, but I'd have to touch them to check for firmness before I could give her a perfect score. From a Karen and Dirty Old Bob standpoint the weekend at the cabin was interesting. I've already told you that Karen knows I lust after her and while she didn't flash her tits at me this weekend she did find several occasions to rub them against me and once she managed to back into my hard cock with her tight little ass and I'm pretty sure that it wasn't as accidental as she pretended. In short - I was cock teased all weekend. Damned good thing that my wife and Just Plain Brother were there or I just might have broken my no family rule and my wife must go first rule. 

Tuesday, July 18 

Hi there dear man who loves my slutty side, 

I'm glad you have such high boobie standards and that you are careful about awarding the coveted "10". 

Karen sounds like a real ball-buster. She's my kind of girl. You realize that knowing that you lust for her makes her feel sexy and alive, right? (and to some degree, powerful). Count it as doing your good deed for another human being. 

I loved the "New Guy In The Office" series. Other than the wet dream of any guy who works in a co-ed office, you really nailed the atmosphere of office sexual politics. That's why I won't fool around there. But you got it right -- there is always that "Who's the new guy (or girl)?" "What's the skinny on him (or her)?" And everybody talks. It is the nature of the office beast. I'm guessing that Karen has told somebody about me at the intern party and the lounge, but maybe not --she has a lot more sins to keep private. No one has ever mentioned the Christmas party, but I don't know if it was gossiped about. Oh well, at least I had fun. 

Thursday, July 20 

Hi Sweetie, 

Just another day at the salt mine. Had breakfast at my favorite restaurant and something happened that gave me fodder for another story. That makes nine stories to have come out of that place. The wife says Karen called this morning before she left for work and that the two of them have cooked up something for the next time we see each other. She won't tell me what. She says the anticipation and uncertainty will do me good. My reply to that was that whatever it was it wasn't going to happen because I would avoid seeing Karen until the wife gave me my fantasy. (You women can sure come up with some nasty looks). 

What do you have planned for the weekend? Going to fly to Denver and visit me? You do know that you are the exception to my Wife Has To Go First rule don't you? 

Love, Bob 

Friday, July 21 

Oh Dearest Bob, 

'm the exception to your Wife Must Go First Rule? Wow!! You don't know how flattered I feel, especially since you have already seen Karen's (a solid "9") boobs. 

No, sorry, no airplane tickets in my purse for this weekend. I think there may be a bar-b-que at one of the neighbors this weekend, and Karen (yes, that Karen) just stopped by my desk asking if I wanted to go out for a drink after work. I said I'd call her if I did. I hesitate because going out with her tends to bring out the worst in me. Of course hubby immediately agreed to baby sit and urged me to go out and have a good time. Maybe I'll disappoint him and go home and have a good time with him. 

Friday, July 21 

Dear Chris, 

Silly girl! You have to realize that the worst that Karen brings out in you is considered by both Gary and I to be your best! 

You don't have plane tickets in your purse because I don't know where to send them. 

Saturday, July 22 

Dear Bob, 

Well. Last night I would have embarrassed even you. I had one orgasm after another in my mouth. I didn't go out with Karen, but I did go out with a couple of other girls....and we went to a Cold Stone Ice Creamery and gorged ourselves on ice cream!! It was an orgy of flavors and sensations. Oh my God, it was so fulfilling!!! Sex is good, but...Rocky Road rules!!! 

Sorry to jerk your chain Dear, I just couldn't resist. 

Love 

A very sated Chris

Hello my sweet 

A day of pulling weeds, repairing broken sprinkler heads and typing stories into the computer. Hope you had a nice weekend. Have attached my latest - hasn't been spell checked or proof read yet

Hello dear. 

It was a nice weekend. Saturday was a bar-b-que with the neighbors. After the last of the food disappeared, we (the women) decided to volunteer the men to watch the kids and 6 of us jumped into a minivan and went bar hopping. The worst that happened was some flirting, but it was nice to discover a few of my friends are as "into it" as I am. In fact, when we were leaving we had to peel one of the girls away from the guy she was sitting with (the hussy - a hubby and three kids at home - shame, shame. He was kind of cute though). On the way home there was some discussion and one of the girls said, "Well, I've certainly changed a lot since college." Two others said, "Me too!" Me? I just sat quietly in the back seat smiling. 

Love, Chris

Good morning sweetie, 

You naughty girl you. Why didn't you speak up and teach those ladies how to have a really good time. Just imagine the neighborhood parties you could have. 

Thursday, July 27 

Dearest Bob, 

Is my getting laid all you ever think about? As for my night out with the girls...There was a lot of gossip about who may be doing what with whom. Also, I have to admit there are two (maybe three) girls I wouldn't mind going out with again to see what happens. One girl, on the way out of the bar, said in the car, "God, I'm so fucking horny!" and the way she acted that night we all believed her. (although having a lot of carnal knowledge floating around the neighborhood gives me great hesitation. 

Saturday, July 29 

Good afternoon love, 

Talk about being a good girl...9:40 on a Saturday night and I'm home, sober, alone (except for a sleeping tyke in the next room) and fully clothed. Where did I go wrong? Am I getting old? 

Thursday, August 3 

Hi sweet and sexy, 

Looking forward to First Friday this month? Go find Karen and tell her that I want you to go out with her and I want her to get you laid. If she asks you who I am tell her just to get her reaction. (Just kidding). 

Friday, August 4 

Hello dear man, 

Funny you should mention Karen. I just got back from lunch with her. She asked me to skip the local "First Friday" spots and go with her to a new bar opening up about hours drive away. She said the owner is a friend of a friend and she promised to attend. You already know that Karen is trouble. I demurred, telling her I would let her know later. 

I laughed when I read what you told me to tell her. That would be a stitch! 

Saturday, August 5 

Hello Dearest 

Sorry to let you (and hubby) down, but I didn't go with Karen last night. She can be a little over the top. I'll have to wait until Monday to find out how much trouble I missed. Instead I was a good wife and mommy and the three of us went out for snowballs. It doesn't get any more All American than that, does it? 

I guess I'm just being careful about safe, discrete and under control situations - and, of course, a real stud with between the sheets talents. I tell hubby, "Don't rush me, I'll do it when I know it's the right place, time and guy." He usually nods and grins and starts right back on me. The guy is incorrigible --but very charming. 

Love, Chris 

Monday, August 7 

Hello Dear 

How was your weekend? I don't have any news, but I still like to check in --you never get too much spam, right? 

Karen stopped by my desk this morning and told me it was all my fault that she had to entertain TWO studs she met at the bar Friday night. According to her she called her husband and told him she was too drunk to drive home and then she and her two studs spent the night fucking and sucking in a motel room until check out on Saturday. Now, that's according to her. I wouldn't be at all surprised if she met (and fucked) a guy, but she may have been pulling my leg about TWO just because I didn't go. On the other hand...it IS Karen we are talking about. Wait until hubby hears I missed out on that action for a snowball!!! 

Tuesday, August 8 

Hello love 

Do you really think Karen would lie about something like that? You shouldn't let Gary know that you missed out for a snowball, you'll break his heart to say nothing of what the info has already done to me. I'm so crushed that I have tear filled eyes and I can't go on --- I can't see the keyboard. 

Love, Bob 

Tuesday, August 8 

Buck up soldier!!! 

No tear drops on the keyboard!!! 

As far as Karen is concerned it could go either way. I think she could have easily gone to a motel with two guys, but she's also capable of saying it just to give me a hard time. Maybe she wanted to see my reaction -- see if I freaked out at a threesome. She is already asking me if I want to go out with her this Friday. Maybe she likes the idea of corrupting a sweet, innocent, little married girl like me!!! What do you think she'd say if I told her I didn't want to share her two, but that I wanted two of my own??? HA! 

Love, Chris

Hi dear Bob, 

I almost - only almost - gave you and Gary something to drool over. I do so hate to be a tease, but sometimes I can't resist. Last night I was at a neighborhood birthday party being hosted by Pammy who is my best friend (female friend anyway) in the neighborhood. She has no idea that I'm such a slut, but she has seen the way the guys look at me (and she has seen me looking back). Anyway, trying to capture it in the style of JPB here goes. 

Dave's Birthday Party 

I didn't know him - I'd never seen him before - but the way he was looking at me made my pussy wet. It wasn't that he was looking at me, it was the way he was looking at me; it was if he wanted to pick me up, throw me across his shoulder and run with me to his cave, his den, his lair and then ravish me and make me his. 

I was used to being looked at because of my great boobs, great legs and marvelous ass and as I moved around the room I could feel his eyes following me. Finally, about two hours into the party I cornered Pammy and asked her who he was. 

"Oh ho, caught your interest has he?" 

"In a way, but only because I seem to have caught his." 

"His name id Jeff Benoit and he is the one that your mother always warned you about." 

"Oh great, girlfriend, just go ahead and tell me he is one of those bad boys that us girls can't seem to resist." 

"You would be wise to resist this one honey, he has left a trail of broken marriages and split up couples that would reach from here to the moon." 

"What does he have that makes him so dangerous?" 

"Don't know, and don't ever plan on trying to find out. I'm happy with Bill and I'm not going to do anything to screw our relationship up." 

"Some girlfriend you are, making me find out for myself." 

"You be careful Christina. You have a terrific guy in Gary. I'd hate to see you lose him over someone like Jeff. Jeff is strictly a love them and leave them guy; the trouble is that he doesn't leave soon enough. He hangs on long enough to get caught and then he rides off into the sunset leaving the wife or girlfriend to clean up the mess and pick up the pieces." 

"You know of course that you keep making him sound more and more interesting." 

"He isn't worth losing Gary over Chris, trust me on that." 

As I walked away from Pammy I felt his eyes boring into me and I turned and looked his way. Our eyes met and my pussy tingled and no man had ever had an effect on me like that, not even my Gary. I knew that if we weren't in my neighborhood and so close to home I'd go over to Jeff Benoit and at least dangle my toes in his dangerous water. 

An hour later I was out on the deck getting a breath of fresh air and looking up at the stars when I sensed a presence behind me. I turned and found Mr. Bad Boy standing right behind me. 

"Hi" he said, "I'm Jeff and you are?" 

"Not interested." 

"What?" 

"You asked, "You are?" and I said, "Not interested." If you put them together you have "You are not interested" and if you say it that way in the form of a question I would say that you were right, I'm not." 

"How did we get there?" 

"I was warned about you and the wreckage you leave in your wake."  

===

"Do you believe everything you hear?" 

"When I hear it from friends who have no axe to grind." 

"You going to tell me that you didn't feel the spark when our eyes met earlier?" 

"Oh I felt it all right, but sparks cause fires and people who play with fire usually get burned. I'm happy with my life right now and I see no great reason for making any changes." 

"Pity. I think it could have been interesting" and he turned and left. 

As he walked away I watched him go and cursed my luck at meeting him at Pammy's party. Any place else and we be off somewhere private and I'd have his cock in my pussy or mouth by now, but I don't play in my yard. Thank God Gary was home baby sitting the little guy. If he was at the party with me he would have been lifting my skirt for Jeff. 

{Did I come close to JPB? Not too flowery was it?}

Hello my love, 

Off work early today and was able to put in some good hours on the computer. Regarding the attached surprise all I can say is that you just can't trust an erotic story writer with anything - including emails. I took some liberties with the story so no one can tie it to you. Also, in my author's note I covered up the fact that I am hopelessly in love with you - unrequited as it may be. 

It has not been spell checked or proof read as of yet. Look it over and let me know if there is anything you want changed. For that matter, if you don't want it posted at all let me know and I'll hit the delete key. 

Thinking of you, Bob

Oh my God! Do I really come off that conceited in my letters??? That's terrible! You know when I say things about my "terrific boobs" I'm saying it sarcastically don't you? Until I read it back to myself in the story I didn't realize that it comes across with NO sense of teasing and irony or sarcasm -- even though I DO have terrific boobs! See what I mean? 

Also, I am going to be very, VERY careful what I say to you from now on knowing that it could end up in a story. No, No, I AM kidding. I enjoy writing to you too much to censor myself. 

Of course I liked the writing, but I'm afraid most of your other readers may find it a little boring because they don't share connection we have. And, it is real life --never as much fun as a story. 

A couple of things...Is there anyway to make it clearer which of us is writing which message? We know, but a new reader might not find it as easy to follow as we do. Also, above July 17 you repeated "mechanism" and at the final party I think you used Tammy instead of Pammy once. 

But, here I am, home alone on a Saturday night, not coming up with any new material for BASW_me_4. It really has been a slow year compared to 2005 hasn't it? Especially when you count the train I pulled at the Christmas party. How will I ever top that this year? 

Anyway, I LOVED reading the story (God...how could you do it with nothing to work with but emails?) and I think I'll be the only BASW with three parts. No, no, there is one out there with 5 or 6 parts isn't there? I guess I have my work cut out for me, don't I? 

Love you, Chris 

To Be Continued??

Authors note: If you are not familiar with Christina's story I would suggest that you read chapters one through three of Becoming a Slut Wife: Christina before you read this story. As in chapter three I am simply going to take our e-mail exchange and present it. Again, as I admitted at the beginning of chapter three, the woman "owns" me and it will come through loud and clear in my e-mails to her. I do hope that my lust for the lady will not detract from her story. 

A brief introduction is in order before beginning this chapter. I made mention in one of my e-mails that I might be out of touch for several weeks because of my hobby. I am a Civil War history buff and a Civil War reenactor. I favor the Southern side, mostly because my ancestors on my mother's side of the family fought for the South. A professor at a local college looking for a way to spice up his lectures on the Civil War asked the local reenactment community for volunteers to give presentations to his classes and in a moment of weakness I raised my hand. This led to an ongoing stint as a guest speaker whenever the history department offered classes on the Civil War era. We pick up Christina's story at that point.

There has to be a BASW_you_4. In BASW_you_2 you gave an indirect promise to your fans that you would be back. I refer to your telling Steve that you only get wild and crazy at Christmas time and that if he were around for next Christmas......? 

I've already started the re-write on BASW_you_3. Hope to have it done and to you for review sometime this week.

Before I forget... 

When you discussed your guest speaker schedule you mentioned that part of your presentation was that we would have been better off if the South had won. As an ex-History major I'm curious - what do you envision as the general outcome of a CSA win? Don't worry; I'm not giving you a homework assignment! Just a few sentences will do to give me something to think about. 

Oh, and by the way, if I were in your class I'd sit up front in a mini and NO PANTIES! And I'd make sure you could see my hard nipples through my top. That wouldn't distract you, Professor, would it? Hey, I'm always willing to earn a little extra credit.

Long day at work. For a change nothing broke down, but the paper shipment did not arrive at 6 AM like it was supposed to. No paper and the press stands idle. Then comes the mad rush to play catch up when the paper does arrive. 

I maintain that the Civil War was not fought over slavery, but for preserving the Union on the Northern side and in defense of States Rights on the Southern side. With McCormick's reapers and other mechanical farming inventions coming on the scene slavery would not have been economically viable much later than the early 1870's. When I state that we would be better off if the South had won I'm talking from a States Rights perspective. Take a look at the Federal Governments involvement in every aspect of your daily life and tell me that I'm wrong. I don't deny that the government does have a legitimate role to play, but NOT to the extent we see today. 

No one could possibly predict what today would be like had the South won, but it very well could still be the United States of America only with a different set of political realities. 

What has that got to do with fucking? Getting any lately? (I know, I'm bad, sorry). 

Bob 

From: Chris 

August 31, 2006 

I get what you are saying about States Rights....but what that means is that Virginia and South Carolina would still be fighting over who is the first among equals. 

And, you're right...it has absolutely NOTHING to do with fucking! Forgive me for getting us off topic. 

I've been reading your interracial stories. Interesting. I dated a couple of black guys in college. More important than cock size (and one of them WAS larger than normal) was all the baggage they brought with them - it was like they could never figure out who they were, or what they wanted to be. When they got with their friends they were totally different than the guy I thought I was dating. They adopted another persona. Then they would change again if they were the only Black in the crowd - another persona. It took all the fun out of going out with them because you never knew who you were with. Just another college guy? A militant? A homie? A rapper? A gangsta? Also - from personal experience - Black coeds did NOT like Black guys dating white girls and they made their feelings very obvious. 

What has that got to do with anything? Well...there's this Black guy who works in our building on a different floor and he has been hitting on me. He is kind of cute - if you like bald heads.

Last night was First Friday and six of us girls went to the grand opening of a club. I do so love how an unattached female attracts attention. I bought my first drink, but that was the only one I bought. I spent three hours in the place and I don't believe thirty minutes was spent sitting at our table. I was kept out on the dance floor. By nine all the other girls had gone home and I was sitting in a booth with two very hunky guys and they had their hands all over me. When they asked me to go with them "to get some fresh air" I got up and willing went out to the parking lot with them. We were in the back seat, my blouse was unbuttoned and my panties were hanging from my left ankle when a police car pulled into the lot and started shining their spotlight on the parked cars. That cooled things off in a hurry so the three of us went back into the lounge. The boys tried to get me back outside when the cops were gone, but the mood had been ruined for me. When I got home and told hubby the story he wasn't very happy with me. He thinks I should have gone back out with them. 

After our little man's bath hubby and I are planning a quiet night in - - reading our books and listening to the rain. (and if he behaves maybe I'll tell him some stories from my past). 

The cute bald headed Black guy? Hubby and I have had hundreds of conversations over the years along the lines of "What if?" What would you do? What would you want me to do? How far would you go? How far would you like me to go? Etc. So what does it all mean? I don't know.

I have returned from Politically Correct Land and not a moment too soon. I despair at the sad state of education in this country. I know that the victors write the histories, but even so they do include some truth about the other side. You would never know it to talk with students taking college level history classes. One freshman even thought that Jefferson Davis was on the Union side in what my great-great-grandfather called The Late Unpleasantness. Jesus wept!!! Thirty-one students in the class and twenty-six believed that the sole purpose of the Civil War was to free the slaves. This even after I read to them Lincoln's own words where he said he would see the blacks remain in chains if it would preserve the Union. I've got to stop doing this. It drives me crazy.

I was hoping to have something hot and steamy to report to you and dearest hubby. I went out with two girls from the office (no, not Karen) for dinner and a little clubbing after work on Friday night. Unfortunately for my two favorite men, all the men I met were absolute gentlemen! What's up with that??? However, I did get business cards with invitations to call for "lunch, dinner, or whatever..." from two nice guys (one is married and said so right up front). They were both older and I thought that might be a nice change from my last couple of adventures, but they both had to leave! Bummer! Was there a good football game on TV or something? 

Maybe next weekend??? 

I am NOT surprised by what you found in the classroom. What can you expect from "U.S. History" by Homer Simpson?

I had a fun night last night (sorry - no illicit sex - at least not yet). I went to a bar with two neighbors. One of them, her brother was playing in the band. The crowd (and it was a crowd) was WAY young, but we did get hit on a bunch and didn't have to pay for a drink all night. I had a chance to take a trip to the parking lot with a real cutie (even if I was twice as old as he was), but I WAS WITH NEIGHBORS and you know how I feel about messing around close to home. 

The band invited us to go with them next Saturday night. They are playing at a wedding reception at a resort hotel and they said if we dress up nice we can crash it. I love wedding receptions - I can get so naughty at them. Cross your fingers sweetie, the dry spell might be over.

Wedding crashers - NOT! Jan - my neighbor whose brother is in the band - called last night to say she couldn't go this weekend. She said that something else popped up, but admitted that her husband didn't like the idea, which is a shame because my hubby LOVED the idea. In fact, hubby suggested that since the brother "Couldn't help but remember me" (isn't he a sweetie?) I could still go with him (the brother) getting me into the reception. I would really be flying solo so I have to think about it.

I'm with Gary on this one (but then I am with him on all he wants you to do) and I do think flying solo is the way to go. I know how you feel about "close to home" and wouldn't having a neighbor lady being around cause you to be a little more circumspect? At best you would end up standing around waiting for her to do it first so she wouldn't be able to look at you in the coming weeks and go "tsk, tsk." Just don't do the brother in the band. If he has a big mouth sister could find out about you. I keep hearing from your public and the question of the day seems to be, "Is Christina doing anything lately?"

It's a good thing you don't live close to us or Gary would come find you and punch you in the nose. The wedding reception is out and you have only yourself to blame. You are the one who reminded me about Jan's brother. You said make sure I didn't do him because he might have a big mouth AND YOU WERE RIGHT! But you overlooked the fact that he will STILL BE THERE and he can pass what he sees back to Jan. And here I had almost talked myself into going. Bad, bad, bad Bob.

Finally wore Gary out enough to slow him down and I've been able to sit down at the computer. Here it is, do with it what you will.

The Rib Joint 

The dirty part started when I was leaving the restaurant, just opening the door, when I heard from behind me: 

"Wow! You sure looked like you enjoyed the ribs." 

Wait. Let me go back to the beginning. You know about our First Fridays of the month and this one started out like most of the others. By Friday afternoon, nine of us (six women and three guys) agreed on our First Friday outing. It wasn't going to be anything special, just dinner at a rib joint two of our co- workers had recommended. 

When I pulled into the parking lot I knew why they called rib joints "joints." It was just a dumpy bar-looking place at one end of a strip mall, but the smoke coming out of the back end of the building sure smelled good. Inside it was small and dark, with a small bar and maybe a dozen tables. The beer was cold and the waitress kept the pitchers coming. The nine of us were in a jolly mood by the time the food arrived and it was worth the wait. The ribs were fantastic. 

After we ate we continued drinking, getting loud but not rowdy, but soon noticed that we were getting the eye from the waitress and the crowd at the door and at the bar. She wanted us out to free up our tables and it wasn't even 6:30 yet. The guys (all married) said they were going home. The four single women all said they were going home to get ready to go out later. Mary, the other married woman said: 

"Hell Christina, Tim's got the kids, I'm going shopping! How about you?" 

I said, "No thanks" and went to the restroom and then started to leave and that is when I heard the guy behind me saying that it looked like I enjoyed the ribs. Here is why he said that. You know how when you are out with a crowd drinking you forget that there are other people around? Well, as we were on our racks of ribs one of the single girls who was sitting across from two of the guys started goofing around. She was acting as if she had something other than a rib in her mouth if you know what I mean. The two guys were moaning and groaning and so the rest of us girls started doing "things" with our ribs until we had all three guys moaning, groaning and saying things like: 

"At least use a condom." 

We were all tipsy and laughing and just having fun - totally forgetting there was a bunch of other people in the restaurant. And, apparently, at least one of them was watching us. 

I turned around and saw a nice looking guy, maybe a few years older than me. He had a great smile. He was dressed in khaki pants and a denim shirt that had the name of the hardware store that was located at the other end of the mall just above the pocket. 

I smiled back and said, "I did enjoy the ribs. They are always fun to eat." 

"You looked like you were having fun. I never saw anyone eat them the way you did." 

"What can I say? I've had a lot of experience...at eating ribs I mean." 

His eyebrows went up at that and his smile got bigger. We introduced ourselves. He was Dave. We stood on the parking lot for a few minutes, just talking, and finally he said: 

"Well, it was nice meeting you. I don't want to hold you up. I guess you have to go and meet your friends at another bar." 

I said, "No, we all split up. I'm not sure what I'm going to do." 

Then he said, "It's awfully early to be calling it a night. You aren't going home are you?" 

The choice was mine. I could have simply said, "Yes, I'm going home to my husband and baby boy" but I didn't. In fact, I didn't say anything. Dave filled the gap. 

"A little later I'm heading to "Annie's." It's a nice bar and tonight they are having a good blues band. Do you like the blues?" 

Did I? Of course I knew who B. B. King and Muddy Waters were, but did I like the blues? Maybe, maybe not, but I did like Dave's smile and his demeanor. "Sure Dave, I like the blues. Who doesn't? How do I get to Annie's from here? Can I follow you?"  

===

"I don't have a car here. I live in those apartments across the highway. I walk to and from work." 

He walked me to my car and I told him to hop in and I'd run him home. When we pulled up he said: 

"I need to shower and change before going out. I won't be offended if you want to wait in the car and I'll hurry, but you are more than welcome to come up and I can offer you a drink or coffee or something." 

I didn't think long on his offer. "I could probably use a cup of coffee." 

We went up the elevator to his floor and then into his apartment and I was surprised. He had told me that he shared the apartment with another divorced guy and I expected a semi-dorm room ambiance, but the part I could see from the front door was neat, clean and well furnished. 

I followed him into the bright kitchen and I sat and we talked while he made the coffee. He was a nice guy and I was glad I didn't go home. AND with all the encouragement I had been getting from Gary (and you) to have another 'little adventure' I was sure that Gary was not going to be upset that I didn't run straight home to him. 

When the coffee machine beeped Dave made my coffee and asked me to excuse him while he showered and changed. I was sitting there drinking my coffee and listening to the noises in his bedroom. When I heard the shower start running I thought: 

"What the hell! I already know how this night is going to end. No need to be shy." 

I walked into his bedroom, stripped off my clothes and opened the bathroom door. He was surprised when I slid the shower door open and got in there with him, but he recovered quickly and started making nice comments about me in my birthday suit. I could tell by what his cock was doing that he meant all those nice things he was saying. 

We embraced and kissed under the water flowing from the shower head. It was very sexy. He was hard against me and I knew I was wet and ready. I turned around and bent over, bracing myself against the back of the tub and waited. Dave moved behind me, pressed his hard cock between my legs and I reached back and positioned him. Then I moaned as he slowly and strongly pushed into me. I thought I was going to cum before he got all the way inside me, but I lasted until his third or fourth stroke. 

He moaned in my ear, "Oh god Christina, I'm not going to last long." 

"Make it as good for yourself as you can Dave, it was already great for me." 

After we got that out of the way we soaped each other, giggling and being naughty with our hands. We rinsed, turned off the water and got out. While we were drying each other Dave began to respond and we barely made it onto the bed before we were fucking again. In the afterglow we decided that a cold beer would be a good thing. He offered to go, but I told him to start dressing and I jumped out of bed and hurried into the kitchen. I grabbed two beers out of the fridge and was heading back to the bedroom when the front door opened. I was bare-assed naked and saw no reason to flip out; the guy at the door had already seen all of me that there was to see. 

"Hi. I'm Christina. Want a beer?" 

He swallowed and said, Ah...sure. I'm Nick." 

"Hi Nick. Here's your beer." 

I handed him one, returned to the fridge and got another one and headed for Dave's bedroom. Nick was still standing there smiling and I smiled back. I walked into Dave's bedroom and handed him a beer and said, "Nicks home." He looked at me and raised his eyebrows and I smiled at him. 

Dave managed to find a hair dryer and I managed to get back to semi-presentable with the make-up I had in my hand bag. Apparently I was in too much of a hurry to get undressed because my pantyhose were a total loss, but I didn't think Dave would mind. Nick took a quick shower and changed and then the three of us left for Annie's. 

It was a large corner bar. Dave and Nick obviously knew a lot of the people there and we sat in a large booth with two other guys and a woman. The DJ eventually shut down and a young looking band got up on the stage and started playing. Either they were really bad or I guess I really didn't like the blues. 

I was sitting on one side of the booth with Nick on my left and Dave on my right. Just after the second set started I felt a warm hand slowly moving up my leg. I turned and looked at Nick who just smiled at me so I smiled back. A minute or so later I felt Dave's hand on my right knee, but it didn't stay there long. I stopped his hand mid-thigh, leaned to his ear and whispered: 

"If you keep going you are going to get a big surprise." 

"I like surprises." 

"All right then" I said and I let go of his hand and leaned back. When his hand discovered his roommate's fingers already in my pussy he chuckled. 

"You are right; I am surprised. Ask Nick if he wants to leave after this set." 

I was getting close to an orgasm and I was enjoying the anticipation of trying not to show it while sitting at a table with five other people. I gritted my teeth and told Dave: 

"You don't have a choice. We *ARE* leaving after this set." 

After my intense, but well concealed orgasm, we set a land speed record back to their apartment. 

The first time was me kneeling, my mouth over Dave's cock, with Nick taking my pussy from the rear and the next two hours were variations on that. When we were in a short break I used Dave's phone to call my hubby and tell him he might not see me until some time the next day and not to worry. I promised I'd tell him everything when I got home, figuring that with his imagination he wouldn't get much sleep either. 

I couldn't say that we slept much. It was more like napping between sex. The next morning I showered with Dave and then Nick and then we wound back in bed and had to do the shower thing all over again a few hours later. When I finally left Dave was out cold and Nick was drowsy and I couldn't get either of them hard no matter how much I tried. On the way across the parking lot I realized that my legs were pretty wobbly and I hoped that my dear hubby would allow me a little sleep before I gave him an account of my night and morning, but knowing Gary I held little hope of that. 

I was right. When I got home he told me that our child was at his mother's and we had the house to ourselves. Oh well, what was a good wife to do?

JPB isn't going to do a hell of a lot with your story. I'll play with it a little to make some things a little clearer, but no way I can improve on the story itself - you nailed it! 

This will be a writing weekend and not a typing weekend because I'm going up to the mountains. Write some, read some, watch the deer at the salt lick and listen to the wind whistling through the pines. One of these days you are going to have to grab Guy #1, pack up Guy #2 and come out here and visit Guy #3 on top of his little part of the mountain. I'll even put on a shirt with the name of a hardware store on it and I have a ball cap that say Tru-Value Hardware on it and I'll fix ribs and I'll....Oh well, it was worth a try.

Thanks for the kind words. I guess it is easier when you are actually there. It was fun and I'm glad I did it. They both gave me their phone numbers, cell and apartment.

Back from a peaceful weekend on the top of my mountain. Got absolutely nothing done in the way of writing. Went up there with the best of intensions and planned on getting a lot done, but all I did was sit on the deck, read and watch the wildlife.

Hey...that's what weekends are for...doing nothing. Of course it must be a lot easier without a pre-schooler in the house. 

Yes, hubby and I had a very nice weekend and thank you for asking. Did I tell you that both of them gave me their phone numbers? They wanted mine, but I refused. Hubby wants to know if I liked either of them enough to call them up. I said, "Hell, I liked them both." He said that would be fine with him. He is totally immoral!!! 

A neighbor invited us to an "Adults only" Halloween party on the 28th, but was quick to say that it didn't mean naughty costumes, it just meant get a babysitter for the rugrats.

My weeks sucks so far my love. Was having problems with Word 97 and Microsoft doesn't support it anymore so I upgraded to Office 2003 and it seems that my computer does not like the change. I am in software hell right now. Contacted Microsoft for help and an example of what I'm getting follows: 

"I worked on this issue and let's trouble the issue and settle down." 

And... 

"If you would like to feel more comfortable speaking to someone else contact my manager Upyukta." 

Needless to say, my problem has not yet been solved. I'll be in touch (probably have to route my e-mail through India). 

Take care, Bob

How can software companies say they "no longer support" an older version? Ford and Chevy couldn't get away with saying, "Gee, a '97 model? Sorry, we no longer support that car."

Nothing new on this end. I'll be leaving for the day in a few minutes (I hope - I hate it when the f_in' phone rings at this time of day). I didn't call Dave. I thought about it, and thought, "It's not like I want to date him or anything." I'm not looking for an affair. I was looking for what hubby so aptly puts "an adventure," and to me newness is a big part of an adventure. How would I come home from a night with Dave (or Dave and Nick) and it sound any different than the last time when I tell hubby about it? 

Anyway, I'm thinking of you, 

Chris 

From: JPB 

October 21, 2006 

Call Dave. If you've thought about it that means you would like to. Believe me sweetie, Gary isn't interested in you having something different to say after having fun with Dave - it is the fact that you ARE having fun with Dave that is lighting his fire. You know your hubby well enough to know when to pull back from another guy if Gary thinks you are seeing too much of him. Look on it as a "friends with benefits" kind of thing. One more thing - I could be wrong, but I get the impression that you like having two playmates at the same time. Dave and Nick would seem to fill the bill and you sound like you like them both. Here is a thought for you - maybe what would work for you and Gary is the affair that you say you aren't looking for. Instead of taking pot-luck every once in a while maybe a steady fellow (fellows?) you see once every couple of weeks or so would work. Ask Gary what he thinks. He might like the idea of knowing he is going to get what he wants more often and he may even be more comfortable knowing that it is from a steady source and not scatter-shot. But then what the fuck do I know? I'm just a dirty old man with a warped mind who wants you, can't have you and so is enjoying you by proxy. 

Thinking of you, wanting you and all that kind of stuff,

Unfortunately, I decided not to call Dave before I got your message. However, I tossed an idea to hubby that he liked -- I told him I could dress a little trashy and show up like an escort at Dave's door for a Halloween "Trick or Treat" next Friday. What do you think? 

Oh, you are right on most of what you said. I really lucked out. I DID like Dave (and Nick) and I sure didn't mind the two of them entertaining me. I think I told you once before that I really believe a woman is made for a MFM threesome (although I do enjoy reading about your MMMF 4-somes!!). As for the affair...I don't think either hubby or I am too sure about that. If I do see Dave next Friday I may have a better answer by next Saturday. However, you also said, "Friends with benefits" and I consider that much different than an affair, and easier to maintain, as long as all those nasty emotions and jealousies don't come into play. The problem being you usually find out they are in play when it is already too late to avoid the messy stuff. 

Love, Chris 

From: JPB 

October 22, 2006 

I like the idea, but I don't think it will work. Dave sounds of an age that he may already be gone out to party by the time you arrive. Maybe if you called him and said you would like to go to a party dressed like a trashy slut and would he be interested? 

Come knock on my door and ask for some candy, Bob 

From: Chris 

October 22, 2006 

I like your idea better. I think I'll call him when I sign off. He's male and it is Sunday...there is a small likelihood that he is watching football. I may go easy on the "trashy slut" talk just to see if he is interested in hooking up again without that added motivation. 

Love you, C.

October 24, 2006 

Well, I called Dave at lunch today and I didn't get good vibes from him at all. I have a feeling that in the harsh light of day I looked pretty much the slut, bedding him and his roommate on the night that I met them. Oh well, it's my own fault. I guess that I was just really up for an adventure and I surprised them. 

Yours, Chris 

From: Chris 

October 25, 2006 

Guess who called. No, not Dave, Nick. He said Dave told him I called and then gave him my caller ID number (it just shows up as the main number for the company and he had to talk to several people after that to track me down). 

He said he would LOVE to get together with me, anytime I'm available -- "the sooner the better." He was very nice and said he knew that Dave had plans for the weekend, but he didn't. 

I guess that makes me feel a little better.

I know its Thursday but I don't know yet! 

I hate to wearing a pout, but I guess Dave's reaction brought me down, and then I thought about what I did, and then I asked myself why I do it, then I worry about what kind of lover and spouse and partner I am and why don't I just quit this extra-marital stuff, and...blah, blah, blah...--aren't you glad you aren't a woman? 

I don't know what I'm going to do. But I DO know that if I see Nick there is NO FUCKING WAY Dave will be joining us.

October 26, 2006 

I don't know if Nick is going to get lucky tonight or not, but if he does I see Dave walking in on the two of you and then stripping to join you. Since Nick will already be occupying the "Promised Land" Dave goes to put his cock in your mouth and you snarl at him, "Get that fucking thing away from me if you don't want it bitten completely off" and then you spend the rest of the night reducing Nick to a puddle of sweat while Dave has to sit in the front room and listen. 

I'm sitting here and seeing it in my mind. You walk up to the apartment door looking like a stone ass slut and when he answers your knock you say, "Hi there sailor, want to fuck?" If he says anything other than, "Good God yes" knee him and go home. 

Love, Bob

October 27, 2006 

Well, I am going to see Nick tonight (see! I AM a slut!). Hubby is happy about it too. Sorry to say, but I'm not dressing up. We are meeting at his favorite Italian restaurant (which I think is such a waste -- if I know that dinner will be followed by gymnastics I never want more than a small salad). The night I met Nick and Dave I was so sorry that I pigged out on ribs! Ugh! 

And yes, I hope Dave does come home and try to join in so I can tell him to buzz-off!!! However, I might give him a charity fuck on the way out next morning - just to show him what he missed out on all night. (After all, I'll probably still be horny and Nick will have passed out from exhaustion!). 

Yours, C 

From: Chris 

October 28, 2006 

Last night was a dud. We were having a nice and somewhat romantic dinner when Nick's cell phone went off. It was a call from his ex. His son had been arrested for DUI (leaving his high school football game) and the ex wanted Nick to handle it. Hubby was really surprised when I got home early. 

I'm beginning to think that anything to do with Dave or Nick is ill-fated. 

Besides, as I told you earlier, I get a much bigger thrill from a new adventure (whether it actually ends in sex or not) than I did last night having dinner with a nice guy and knowing that we were going sex afterwards. Let's face it -- it was a date -- and I'm MARRIED! I don't want to date. Can I say I just want to fuck around for the buzz it gives me? 

Anyway, off to a neighbor's party with my hubby.

October 30, 2006 

Hello sweetie, 

How was your weekend? All is well in Christina's land. Nothing to report on the naughty side. Hubby and I went to a Halloween party last night at the neighbors and you get credit for our costumes (We had just finished reading "A Super Hero's Slut"). Gary dressed in a Spiderman T-shirt and plastic mask and I wore a short dress and a RED, RED wig as Mary Jane. I looked sexy as all get out and I did get hit on several times and even though I was tempted by one or two you know how I feel about playing close to home. Gary called me a spoil-sport. If it was up to him he would have had me doing a gangbang with everyone there in the middle of the dance floor. What am I going to do with that boy? 

Also some gossip to pass along..... 

Did I ever tell you about a nice guy I met at our Y's free swimming? He brought his pre-schooler and I brought mine. We ran into each other several times and it was nice talking to him and I did at one time feel like we might get something going. WELL! The big scandal in the mother's locker room is that he and the Lifeguard were having a torrid affair and his wife found out about it and is now in the process of cutting his balls off (financially and legally). The Lifeguard is eighteen now, but she wasn't when the affair started. This could get very, very ugly! I'm SO glad we didn't take our conversations anywhere. 

Love you! C 

From: JPB 

October 30, 2006 

Don't you feel bad now knowing that you are responsible for that poor man's plight? If you had just pressed on and had gotten something going with him he would have never had to turn to the lifeguard in the first place. 

Did you go to the party as MY Mary Jane (cock hungry slut) or the one portrayed in the comics (brain-dead publicity seeker with big tits and minimal talent)? 

Bob 

From: Chris 

October 30, 2006 

I just knew you would blame me for the Swimmer's terrible plight. Sometimes I think you and hubby share the same brain. Apparently I was too old for him! Besides, he must not have been very discrete -- that has to be one of the worst things in an adulterous affair. 

Now which MJ do you think I was at the party? Besides, doesn't brain-dead, publicity seeker with big tits and minimal talent sound more like the real me?

First Friday has come and gone and a frustrating and wasted night it was. Several of us went to a new club that had only been open about a month or so. As usual being an unattached female got me lots of free drinks and invitations onto the dance floor and by the time my friends all left roaming hands had me hot enough to fuck and you better believe that was my intention. I was sitting in a booth with a hot young guy (at least five years younger than me - what is it with me and cradle robbing?) and he had his fingers in my pussy when I happened to look up and see two of my neighbors walk in with their husbands. I excused myself to go use the ladies room and snuck out the back door and hurried on home. Poor Gary - he turned out to be the one who had to put out the fire. I think I hurt him. He is walking funny today.

As a matter of fact last night did end with a little smooching and a phone number. This guy got up from the bar and joined our party. He was drowning his sorrows, but finally did admit that "W" couldn't finish a Sunday crossword puzzle. When I got up to leave he offered to walk me to my car. I went to the restroom and told him to meet me by the door. We talked at my car and one thing led to another, but it didn't go beyond swapping tongues. Hubby suggested I call him and set something up with him to help him get over the election results. 

I do want to tell you what happened to me today. It is like something out of one of your stories, but, in real life, it pissed me off. When I signed on this morning I had an e-mail from the VP in charge of our little 'road-show' thing. He was inviting me to a business lunch with a potential client. When I called him to ask what to prepare for the meeting he said: 

"You don't have to prepare anything Christina, I just want you there looking pretty and being pleasant." 

Well, I went and I was pleasant, but I was grinding my teeth the entire time. I'm NOT going to say no to a VP. Sexist bastard! Even hubby agreed that I wasn't overreacting. What do you think? 

Love, Chris 

From: JPB 

November 9, 2006 

Sounds to me like your lunch was a fishing expedition on his part. Maybe he just wanted to see how you would handle it before trying something heavier. Then again, he may be a DOM like me and likes to be in the company of beautiful women. Also, you don't know what he told the other guy about you or if he told the guy anything at all. Maybe he just wanted you on his arm so the other guy would think you were his honey -- make him look like a stud (I know you will find that hard to believe, but men do do things like that). 

Love, Bob 

From: Chris 

November 10, 2006 

I'm sorry, I wasn't very clear about the client meeting. I think I was invited (can I say this without sounding terribly un-humble?) as a decent looking woman who doesn't have a problem conversing with people (especially men) to make an eighth for the table. The business luncheon was the client (3 men), the VP (who I love, but really think he is gay), his administrative assistant (an attractive 60 y.o. woman) and two male flunkies. All I had to do was be sociable and talkative. I'm over it and besides, it is never a bad thing for a VP to know you by your first name (as long as you haven't recently fucked up). 

About the phone number...I think I went through this with you before. Hubby just called and asked if I had called the man. But that ends up in a date, and as I have told both of you I'm NOT looking to date someone -- I just like the 'adventures' that pop up. Now, if I called him and said, "Meet me at The Hot Sheet Motel at 7 and don't be late" that would be an adventure (at least the phone call would be).

I know, I know, I'm a bad girl. I haven't answered any of your recent ones - - no excuses. Just busy at work and busy at home. Nothing happening here that would excite your fevered mind anyway. Gary is threatening to throw me out and replace me with some hot chick. He says he knows a Jehovah's Witness that is a bigger slut than I am AND she goes door to door. What can I say -- when it isn't there it isn't there.

I AM thinking about a Christmas present for you. You know how much I love the holidays and the mood I get into. Hubby is also asking me to "UP" my hot wife heat. I won't promise that Karen will be involved, but I would not be surprised if a little naughty adventure occurred between now and Christmas. I'm hoping it will be spontaneous and surprising (like the rib joint night!) and that I won't be driven to do something desperate, like last minute shopping just so I don't disappoint my two favorite men.

The company Christmas party is coming up. Big deal! They aren't going to have booze again this year so I'm sure the place will clear out as fast as it did last year. You do remember what happened last year, don't you? Could lightening strike twice?

Shit, shit, shit!!!! 

I just got back from a meeting with our HR person (about a 'troubled' employee on my team). After the meeting wraps up she then tells me that they are looking at a resume from someone who gave me as a reference. Yup --Matt from Toledo! She says his resume looks good and they are flying him out next week for an interview. Then she asked what I thought of him -- I assumed that she meant OUT of bed. I had to tell her the truth that he was sharp, personable, knew his stuff and that his boss told me that he was a hard worker. I couldn't screw his job chances because I screwed him. I've tried so hard to separate work from fun. Did I ever tell you that all the guys that were on the team that went to Toledo with me have left the company? There is no one left with the company who knows how big a slut I can be (except for Karen) and here comes Matt. What happens if he is hired and comes to work here? Who would have guessed it was even a possibility? SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!!!

I am sure that you have heard the truism that "No good deed goes unpunished." Your good deed was in giving Matt a good recommendation. Your punishment will probably be Matt constantly trying to get you into the supply closet. Oh joy! Just think of the stories. For your own piece of mind I wouldn't share this bit of information with Gary. Then again, maybe you would like having him after you every day to go out and play with your new fellow employee. One possible way out -- point Karen at him.

Well, I'm out of panic mode. Matt called me today after he heard from our HR department. Turns out he is a pretty cool guy after all. 

Last night hubby played it just right - he was upset because I was upset and he didn't say anything that could be construed as a "hot wife" topic (even if he was thinking about it). 

Anyway, Matt called me to say that he had been invited up for an interview, but he told me he had just accepted his "dream" job down in Miami. Then he said if it was possible that we could hook up again he would still come up for the interview. I told him I'd love to se him again. After he called HR back he called me back and said he was scheduled for an interview on Friday 12/8 and then he asked if he could book his return flight for Saturday instead of Friday. I told him that even though I could not make any promises about my weekend availability that if he felt lucky he might want to book the flight for Sunday. I am such a slut!!! Anyway, crisis averted and maybe some adventures coming to relate to you and hubby.  

===

I wasn't worried so much about being chased into the supply closets and stairwells, I was worried because Matt is a guy and guys talk (and don't tell me they don't). At least Karen is discrete (so far) -- probably she has more sins to hide than anyone else. 

Whew! I feel better. 

Love you, Chris

This sucks!!! Guess who is still at her desk at 7:11 PM on a First Friday? The crowd left almost two hours ago heading for a hotel lounge Happy Hour and buffet which ended about 11 minutes ago. 

Oh well, thinking of you and getting ready for the cold weather to hit us this weekend. 

Yours, C

Oh Bob, I AM SUCH A SLUT!!! I did things last night that I haven't done since college. AND I didn't need Karen. 

I got to the lounge too late to meet our crowd, but the band sounded great and so I decided to stay for a couple of drinks. A guy asked me to dance and he was a hunk so I got out on the floor with him and damned if I all of a sudden didn't get a tingle down you know where. We got all sweaty drinking and kissing and dancing and fooling around in his booth and around mid-night I'm in the handicapped stall in the men's room getting fucked by a guy I just met. Talk about romance! We were dancing and he all of a sudden took me by the hand and pulled me along to the men's room and believe me when I say I knew what was coming when he opened the door and pulled me in. He was pounding into me and I was moaning and groaning and outside the stall I could hear guys asking if they could be next. 

Let me tell you - I was the center of attention when we got back to his booth. A half dozen guys came over to ask me to dance, but my stud ran them off. When I said I had to go he said he would walk me to my car, but we never got there. We ended up fucking in his big pick-up truck out in the parking lot. I felt so slutty looking out his window and seeing guys looking in while I'm on my back with my legs up on this guy's shoulders. I had a HUGE orgasm. THEN he walked me to my car and we ended up on my back seat doing it again. No names (he called me Buttercup and I called him Hunk), no phone numbers, nothing but sex. How disgusting am I? I was SO horny I just went with it. Of course feeling that horny can only mean one thing, so no surprise, this morning I got my you-know- what. 

Gotta run. Birthday party for a neighbor and all I want to do right now is sleep. 

Love, Chris.

I've been dealing with a tremendous case of the guilts this weekend. I acted so trashy and then I come home to the greatest guy in the world. Is he upset? No, of course not. I just don't deserve him. I do it with another guy and then I wonder why I'm not home doing it with the guy I love. This is just so weird. I'd swear off any and all extra-marital sex, but I know Gary would be disappointed (at least I think he would), and I also know it would probably happen again anyway. You have been there Dear, did Nan have second thoughts? 

Forgive me for going on and on Dear. My hormones have been bouncing all over the place. Its time for me to sign off and cry for a while.

Not that I ever knew of. She did express some regret over the wedding gangbang, but told me that it was because she couldn't let me know in advance that it was going down so I could have watched if I'd have wanted to. 

DO NOT FEEL GUILTY because you are doing it with someone other that Gary. Don't ever forget that it is what he wants you to do. If you had called him from the bar and had told him what was going down and then asked him if he would rather have you come home and do it with him instead of some stranger what do you think he would have said? You have the best of both worlds my love; be grateful and take advantage of it while it lasts. 

Yours in lust, Bob 

From: Chris 

December 3, 2006 

Thank you lover. I am so glad that I have someone to vent these things with besides Gary. He is so sweet and always puts me first on our "issue" and I appreciate getting a "second opinion" from another man I care about and who has gone through what I put Gary through. I know you won't be surprised to hear that he said exactly the same thing you did: "If you had called, what do you think I would have said?" 

Another thing you said: "Take full advantage of it" is also true. Its not like I don't get off on the naughty sex and then get off again coming home and telling Gary all about it. 

Anyway, I'm feeling better. 

Matt is coming in on a Friday morning flight, but has a return flight around 1 PM on Saturday. Just to give you some perspective on the fairer sex's hormone imbalance at certain times I mentioned to Gary that if he really DOES want to WATCH I could offer Matt our fold-out in the family room for Friday night. He's thinking about it. I really don't know what his final answer will be -- and if it is yes, will I be able to do it? Stay tuned. 

Thanks for being you, Chris

December 4, 2006 

I'm glad I can be a sounding board and long distance shoulder for you. As far as can you if Gary says yes - of course you can. You love him and you love giving him what he wants. You will be a little nervous the first time, but it will go away when you feel the first orgasm coming on. YOU will be fine. There are two problems - one is Gary and the other is Matt. It is a big step from hearing about it to actually watching and/or joining in and Gary is going to be a whole hell of a lot more nervous than you. And Matt - Can he perform knowing that your hubby is watching? Is Gary going to be in the room? Is he going to participate? Can Matt handle any of those three? I know that the first time you planned on doing Matt he was going to share you with his buddy, but his buddy and your hubby are two different breed of cat. 

My advice, as worthless as it sometimes is, is that you tell Matt that Gary is a sound sleeper and that you will come to him when Gary has fallen asleep. Tell him once Gary falls asleep a bomb wouldn't wake him up. Then, if Gary is going to play, wait until Matt is balls deep and going for the glory before you moan in his ear, "Can my husband play, please?" I promise you no man who is close to coming is going to stop, get up and leave. 

Damn!!!!! Why can't it be me!!!! 

Love you baby, Bob 

From: Chris 

December 5, 2006 

Well, in discussing the "big night" Gary says that he is not interested in joining in (after all, it is all his peeping on his mom and sister and their lovers that is probably the basis for his whole thing). If that will change after his watching for a while neither of us knows. 

And I'm with you -- I don't think a good-looking guy, just graduating from college is going to freak out if asked to share his booty. 

We have the house set up so Gary can watch without Matt knowing. Grandmom has agreed to pick our son up after school and keep him till Saturday. Are we forgetting anything? 

I have to admit I'm getting very excited about this weekend. I hope it all works out. Wish me luck.

I just got back from my meeting with my favorite VP! Remember the one who invited me to lunch with him and some clients last month? Well, he wanted to know if I could accompany him, his PA and a flunky up to Boston to attend the client's company Christmas party. He had already cleared it with my boss! We will take a limo up on Wednesday 12/13 and limo back on Thursday. When I repeated that I knew nothing of the clients business he said that it wouldn't be important, that we wouldn't be doing all that much business and it would be a very nice party. As I said before, I'm not about to say no to a VP. I'm beginning to think that something is going on that I don't know about. No, not the VP - I still think he is gay. 

Love, C

I know why he wants you along sweetie. Read the attached (Just Another Day At The Office) and pay attention to what Elaine is doing for corporate America. Wonder why the VP isn't taking Karen? You two just have to have a night out together for me. 

I hear the garage door opener so that means the wife is back from her three day business trip. Got to run.

December 10, 2006 

Whew! It has been a busy two days. Our plans for Friday didn't work out -- Gary didn't get to watch. Matt booked a motel by the airport. He said he wasn't comfortable coming to my house. I had put in for some personal time on Friday afternoon so I met Matt as soon as his interview was over and we went to his room. 

Torrid sex from three in the afternoon until eleven the next morning. As soon as we got to his room I started to doing a slow strip for him, but he said, "To hell with that" and he grabbed me and pushed me down on the bed. The first time was with my skirt pushed up to my waist and my panties pushed aside. It was animal sex at its finest! The two of us just rutted there on the bed and I had two orgasms before I even got my clothes off. 

Once they were off they didn't get put back on until the next morning. We didn't even stop to eat (not food anyway). We fell asleep around nine after several hours of cock sucking, pussy licking, sixty-nining and flat out fucking. 

I woke up around mid-night and saw him lying there with his limp cock lying on his leg and I just had to go after it. He woke up just about the time I had him stiff enough to ride and I climbed on board. He was young, he was energetic, and he recovered fairly fast, but he was alone! The state I was in I needed two more guys in that room that night. I managed to get three more times out of him before I had to drive him to the departures area. I gave him a passionate kiss and said good-bye pretty sure that I would never see him again. 

I used my cell to call hubby and tell him that there was still a fire that needed to be put out and to get ready for me. 

Saturday night we went to a Christmas party at a neighbor's, but nothing to report. Too many close neighbors for me to risk anything (although Gary did point out two guys he thought I might have some fun with -- the man is incorrigible). 

Picked our boy up today and went to the pool at the Y. It was great. Everyone must have been shopping. It was the two of us and a grandfather and granddaughter. We had a ball. 

And now I'm getting ready to go back to work and get ready for our Boston trip on Wednesday. 

What is it with December that brings out the slut in me? And we haven't even got to the company Christmas party yet and you KNOW how that turned out last year. 

Love you baby, Chris

Authors note: I have received many comments about the form in which Christina's story is being told. A lot do not care for my using her emails to me as the format, but they are in the minority. The comments are running four to one in favor and so I will continue to let Christina tell her own story in her own words. As a sop to those who don't like the email format I will cut down some on the use of headings and limit them to enough to identify the recipient and the date. I will also add the time if there were more than one e-mail sent on that date. I will eliminate the sign off signature since only Christina and I are involved and if the e-mail is addressed to me Christina obviously sent it. 

The story picks up where chapter five ended on December 10, 2006 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

To: C 12/11/06 

Sorry to hear that Gary was denied, but I kind of thought it might happen. Sorry for him, but tickled pink for you. 

Here it has been slow. Have spent the last three days decorating the outside of the house and the trees in the yard. I did manage to get chapter 6 of Scarlett done and I have sent it off to TGBL for her review. I haven't gotten it back from her yet and my deal with her is that she gets to check it out before I post it. She has already sent me enough material to start on chapter 7 of her story. 

Do you realize how many women you have brought into my life? It was you contacting me and what followed (Becoming a Slut Wife Christina, chp.1) that had all of the other women writing me and wanting me to tell their stories. Kathy, Mickey, Mona, Kathleen, Julie and TGBL all because of you. Getting to know you has been good for me. 

To: JPB 12/11/06 

Getting to know you has been very, very good for me too. I treasure what we have developed over the last year. That I brought more women into your life is great because it is just that many more of your stories to read. 

Don't worry about Gary. He left for work today with a big smile on his face. I'm really not sure that either one of us is ready for a "performance," so I think things worked out for the best. I will tell you that hooking up with Matt when I was on the business trip was much higher on the "Naughty Meter" than just getting together with him in a motel room (although the sex was enjoyable). 

To: C 12/12/06 

What do you have planned for the holiday season party-wise? Any chance that you will give me my Christina/Karen moment? 

To: JPB 12/12/06 

What's up with me party-wise? Well there is a party in Boston tomorrow night, but being a clients party, and being asked to go by a VP, don't expect any additions to BASW_me. 

Our company's Christmas party is next Wednesday. Of course, we will all be like third-graders on the last day of school waiting for the bell to ring so we can leave the company party (they don't serve booze) and go to the after party parties. Stay tuned. Who knows if Karen and I will end up in the same place. 

Hubby's office party is just a luncheon at a nice restaurant, employees only. 

Of course there are the neighborhood parties (we are hosting one this weekend), but you know I don't fool around at those. 

I would imagine that Friday, the 22nd will be a day of early departures from the office and there are always spots to check out for holiday cheer. I will, of course, let you know immediately if anything happens. So hold off on the next part of my slutty saga - the holidays are just getting into full swing! 

To: JPB 12/13/06 

If you could see me now! I'm in a sumptuous hotel room in downtown Boston and getting ready for cocktails at 6, dinner at 7, followed by a live band till 11. And this after being driven up here in a limo! 

The ride up was a briefing on the client (our host), with my assignment being to be sociable and pleasant, speaking of our company only in the highest terms. I think I can handle that. 

Don't look for any new material for my slutty bio - I'll be drinking club soda and being very well behaved. I feel like Charley, the VP who invited me along, is doing this to see how I handle myself. Why? I haven't a clue. 

To: JPB 12/14/06 

Oh no! No check in from my guy. That must mean work isn't going too well for you. 

Well my trip was terrific, but I lied when I said no mischief would take place. The party was very festive. The hosts were very posh - the bar was name brands (even single malt scotches), the meal was prime beef filet and lobster (right up my alley) and they did have a live band. I did stick with the club soda and I did stick pretty close to Charley (the VP) and Dana (his special assistant). A little while after dinner Charley disappeared with some of the guys (big poker players) and Dana disappeared. Most of the rest of us took the party over to the lounge. Left to my own devices I started saying yes to guys who asked me to dance. There was a lot of flirting going on (eyeball flirting, conversation flirting, and groping hands flirting), but I kept my cool and kept my legs together. 

Until! 

It was almost one o'clock and I had been dancing with some guys who had come into the lounge when the wedding reception they had been attending ended. I was dancing with (and being groped by) a good looking guy named Tony and he kept asking me to go home with him. I looked around the lounge and saw that all of my group was gone, but even so I was leery of taking a chance. To make a long story short the slut in me finally said yes, but only if he could get me back to the hotel early enough so that no one would know I'd been gone. I know I'd told Gary that there wouldn't be anything happening on the trip and I debated calling him to let him know that things had changed, but then I realized he would be in bed asleep. I decided to call him in the morning and that would give him a day to think about it. 

When I saw the inside of Tony's apartment I thought I would gag. He lived like a pig. But a pig is an animal and that is just what Tony was in bed. There were no niceties it was just a case of "We know what we are here for so let's get to it." Tony didn't care if I got anything out of the experience as long as he got what he wanted and he wanted a lot. Fortunately for me he had staying power and I got off five times during the four times he fucked me before it was time for me to get back to the hotel. 

He got me back to the hotel at ten to six and I went right for the shower. When I came out the phone was ringing and it was Dana telling me that we were all going to meet downstairs for breakfast at seven-thirty. After she hung up I called home and told Gary what I'd been doing all night and then I went downstairs to meet the rest of the group. We had a leisurely breakfast and then the limo took us home. 

To: C 12/14/2006 

Sorry that I missed a few, but you called it - work has sucked big-time the last three days. Fourteen hours on Tuesday, seventeen hours on Wednesday and twelve today. But it was not unexpected. It gets like this during the holidays every year. 

Hooray for you for starting off the next chapter in the Christina saga. AND we still have eighteen days until we get past New Years. My list that I sent to Santa has a Christina/Karen moment right at the top of the list and with eighteen days of holiday parties yet to go it just might happen. 

Still waiting to hear from TGBL on chapters 6 & 7 so I can post them. 

To: JPB 12/15/06 7:50 AM 

Guess who called me? Remember Nick, the roommate from the night at the rib joint? Well, his firm is having a Christmas party on Thursday (12/21) and he called me and invited me. He called me once, after our first encounter, asking to get together, but it didn't happen. But I'm a sucker for Christmas parties (and for what happens after them) so I told Nick I'd think about it and call him back tomorrow. I called Gary and told him about the invite and I know you know what he said. The way I feel right now I'm probably going to say yes. 

To: JPB 12/15/06 6:05 PM 

I'll have you know I was a very good girl tonight. Driving home I passed a lounge with a marquee outside that said they were having their biggest party of the year tonight and I kept on driving (but not without second thoughts). Besides, I've missed my two guys this week AND we do have to get the house clean and the food ready for tomorrow night (the neighborhood party we are hosting). 

I called Nick and told him I would love to go to his party. I guess after the long night we spent together neither of us will be surprised about the post- party party. 

To: JPB 12/17/2006 

We hosted a VERY interesting party last night. To both Gary's and my surprise after midnight the neighbors seemed to get a lot more neighborly than ever in the past. Maybe I should have cut back on the oyster stew and the fried oysters appetizers. Of course by that time they were all pretty well snockered too. Around 11:30 the people with younger babysitters had to leave and usually the husband and wife take turns about who can stay and who has to go home and relieve the babysitter. When the dust cleared there were nine husbands and six wives still there. 

Gary had some killer mixes in the CD player and people were dancing in the family room. I was in the kitchen talking to three other girls and one of the guys came up and herded us downstairs. Even in the meager light of one candle it was obvious there was a lot of kissy-face and groping going on among the dancers - NONE of whom were married to each other! Gary and I looked at each other in amazement. Nothing like that had ever happened before, at least not that we knew about. Maybe we were leaving the parties too soon. 

Anyway, a guy dragged me of into the darkness and over the next hour or so I wore off all my lipstick and had been felt up (boobs and butt) by most (if not all) the guys who were there. I even had one whispered invitation to sneak off for something more intense, but I don't like to play in my own sandbox so I politely declined. Around one-thirty people started drifting out and by two Gary and I were alone and wondering just what the hell had happened. As stoked as we were we went to bed and did some major rearranging of the bed sheets before falling asleep. 

A couple of the girls called today to thank us for the good time and I asked the ones who had stayed about the make-out part. They said it had happened before, but not on a regular basis and it was all in good fun. Well all right!! Have to stay later when we go to these neighborhood parties. Also, maybe it was because the neighborhood jack-ass and his wife weren't there. They had other obligations so maybe that allowed the girls to relax more than usual. Whatever the reason, it was strange and it just about knocked the socks off hubby and me. 

This is turning into some month. What's next? Oh yeah...the company Christmas party and Nick's X-mas party. Stay tuned. 

To: C 12/18/2006 

Couldn't sleep last night so I sat at the computer and entered BASW_you_4. I haven't ended it yet. I can't make up my mind to finish it after the no name on the back seat of his truck or carry it through Matt's visit. I'm leaning toward Matt's visit being the start of chapter 5. 

KM 13 is half typed into the box and 14 is half written. Still haven't heard from TGBL and under the circumstances (hubby in the hospital) I'm not going to push her to review her story and get it back to me. 

Take care and think of me begging Santa to put you in my stocking this year. After all, I have been a very, very good boy. 

To: JPB 12/18/2006 

I thought I'd pass along that hubby enjoyed the same tactile pleasures as the rest of the guys at the party (and he was sober enough to remember). He told me that there were some incredible racks and butts on our female neighbors, but swore (wisely) that mine were absolutely and unquestionably THE BEST! Which is why I saw to it that he had such a nice weekend! 

To: C 12/20/2006 

Not much going on today. Got a little more of KM 13 into the computer and have finished putting her emails into order for chapter 14. I will probably do You_4 before I start on KM 15. I want to give that chapter some time to sit in case she does something over the holidays that I can include. 

They are predicting blizzard conditions here for tomorrow - just what I need for my worst workday of the week. It is an extremely good bet that you will not hear from me tomorrow. 

Finished the house and all I have to do now is wrap a bunch of presents. I don't know if I mentioned it, but next week is going to be a great week. I'm taking the entire week off as vacation. Don't got no plans to do nuthin!! 

To: JPB 12/20/2006 

Glad to hear you are taking some vacation. I like having time off with nothing planned. Hopefully your wife will let you sneak off to the computer during the week. Just tell her she needs to share you with your other women - or at least one of them - ME! 

I just got back from my annual one-on-one with the bosses. They said very nice things about my performance this year and they offered me a promotion. Charley and Dana (the people I went to Boston with) would like me to join Charley's staff. I did not hesitate to say yes. It's more money and it can't possibly be more hours than I put in this year. After the New Year I'll be a special projects coordinator - whatever that is! Will I be a special coordinator, or will I coordinate special projects??? Ha! Who cares. Anyway, a very special afternoon for me. 

To: C 12/21/2006 

For once the weatherman didn't lie - we are in the middle of a blizzard. The paper shut down at 2 PM and sent everyone home and told us not to come back to work until they called us. My drive home - normally a seven minute jaunt - took me forty-five minutes and even then it was only that short of a drive because my truck has four-wheel drive. Between leaving for work at 6 AM and getting home close to 3 PM three feet of snow accumulated in my driveway. Even with my ten horse snow blower it took me an hour and a half to clear the drive so the wife could get her car in the garage when she got home. Her normal commute time is about thirty minutes, but it took her four and a half hours to get home. I am house bound for at least two days. It will be interesting to see how much computer time the wife will let me have during that time. 

When I hit the send button on this I'm going to jump on KM 13 and try and get it done. You should see it tomorrow. 

Barring a power outage I'll keep checking in and I will spend my nights between now and Christmas praying that Santa got my list and that on Christmas morning I'll find you in my stocking (in stockings and high heels). 

To: JPB 12/21/2006 

The weather in your area has been the lead on all the news shows (I guess they think that people not getting snow like to see other people getting it). 

About last night. After the office thing I went right home and Gary and I split a pizza and a six-pack of Sam Adams celebrating my good news. I asked him if he still wanted me to go to Nick's party tonight and he suggested I pack a bag in case I don't make it home. Can you understand him? Sometimes I can't! Of course, slut that I am, I already have a packed suitcase in the trunk of my car. 

Was I at the TOP of your list to Santa? And when you say stockings and heels you mean just stockings and heels, don't you? Well, I have to admit, it isn't a bad look. 

To: C 12/21/2006 

At the time I type this it is 9:30 PM where you are and with any luck you are getting laid. God but I do so wish I could be the one looking down (or up) at you. 

No party for me today. Me and the snow-blower were busy trying to dig out. Almost done with KM 13. Actually it is typed into the computer, but I haven't proof read it yet. A little less time in snow up to my waist and I might have had it done by now. 

To: JPB 12/22/2006 

Well, I wasn't getting laid by 9:30, but it wasn't too long after that! At the party Nick introduced me to his friend Matt (I know-another Matt-what are the odds?). Matt said Nick had told him that when he met me I wasn't wearing a thing. I told him that was a lie - I was wearing a very big smile. Haha! 

After the party Matt invited us up to his newly redecorated condo. I was a little surprised, and yet not too surprised, that when we got there it was only the three of us. Nick said, "I know you don't find that three is a crowd" and I didn't disagree. You know what happened next. 

It was a good thing I had packed a suitcase. 

I was late to work this morning. 

I'll give you more detail later, but I'm running a little behind so I'll get back to you later. 

To: JPB 12/22/2006 8:34PM 

Well, our boy is finally asleep. I don't know if he will make it to Monday morning before his head explodes. I can't remember , but I don't think that I was all that wound up for Christmas when I was his age. I'm taking a break from wrapping presents to get this off to you. 

Of course you know that I'm having a major case of the guilts about last night. Gary handled it fine, it's me. Same old, same old. I know I've bored you with this stuff before, but I keep telling myself that this is going to be the LAST time. 

Details: 

I followed Nick and Matt from the party to Matt's condo. Upstairs, when I asked when the rest of the people were coming Nick said that it would just be the three of us if that was all right with me. I was just a little pissed that Nick was taking me for granted, but what the hey, you know I like two to play with. 

Matt put on some nice music, made us another drink (my first of the evening since I hadn't known if I might be driving home) and we sort of danced for a while (sort of danced meant we groped to the music). I asked Nick if he would mind letting Matt and I get acquainted for a little while since I had just met him. We went to the bedroom and undressed each other, started feeling up each other and then Matt sat on the bed as I stroked him and, just as I was about to take him into my mouth he exploded all over my face. I told him not to worry as it was always nice to get that first quick one out of the way. 

He then spent his energy on me -- my face and lips, my neck, my breasts, stomach and finally (thank God!) my pussy, bringing me off completely twice. Then it was my turn with my mouth and he responded. We fit together well, but he still didn't last long. 

While we were catching our breath Nick got on the bed (naked of course), got between my legs and took me hard until we both came. We cuddled and played for a while and Nick got hard again and we took a long time getting to our next climax while Matt watched. 

Nick got up to get drinks so Matt and I showered and he got hard and we rushed back to the bed and he took me from behind as I took Nick in my mouth. They both took a looooooong time to come and I was beat when we all finished. 

Matt woke me in the middle of the night, working on my breasts, and we got to it. Our bouncing on the bed didn't wake Nick and it was a great fuck and I had my sixth or seventh (but who was counting?) orgasm of the night. 

Nick woke me up in the morning when he crawled on top of me and the noise and bouncing woke Matt and he joined us. Finally, after bagels and coffee, it was time for me to get dressed and get into the office. I sent Nick to my car to get my bag and I got in the shower. Matt joined me and began eating me. This delayed things as Nick returned, saw (or heard) us and the three of us made it to the bed again. 

And that boss, is why I'm late getting in today!!! You aren't going to dock my pay, are you? 

Anyway, that's how I remember it and THIS IS MY LAST TIME - NO MORE! I can't keep being a slut even if my husband does want me to be one (Gary is looking over my shoulder and snickering as I type this - he doesn't think I can do it) BUT I MEAN IT!!!! NO MORE!!

Write when you can. I know its Christmas and things can get crazy, but I do like hearing from you. 

P.S. 

I meant to tell you...remember the party last weekend? All the kissy-face and touchy-feely? Well, I talked to Joan during the week and she told me that during the summer she and her husband were at a pool party with three other neighbor couples (6 of the 8 were at our party) and around midnight it turned into a skinny dipping. There was the same kissing and feeling that took place at our party and she is pretty sure that one couple, (neighbors and NOT married to each other) actually fucked in the water (she wouldn't tell me who). She said that nobody talks about it after it happens and that I was the first one to ever ask what the hell was going on. She says she guesses everybody just has a little fun and blames it on the booze. This is very weird!

Going to have a full house tomorrow. Two sons, two daughters, one daughter in law and five grandbabies. Whenever the wife asks me what I want for Christmas the stock answer is "peace and quiet" which is the one thing I never get. 

BASW_you_4 is either done or not. I can't make up my mind whether to take it to your nameless stud in the parking lot or end it after your night with Nick and Dave. Ending it after Nick and Dave gives us a 5500 word story. I've attached it (not spell checked or proof read) so check it over and tell me what you think. I can still go to the nameless stud or I can start BASW_you_5 with the build up toward the Halloween party and the "should I call Dave or not" period. Your story lover, your call.

Gary and I just finished playing Santa and putting out the toys under the tree. A few neighbors had open houses and I may have sipped a bit too much wine, but I love this moment - the last moment of anticipation of what Christmas is going to be - no broken or wrong sized gifts, no disappointed faces, no hangovers, no sore bellies from eating too much at the table - just that almost perfect moment of a beautiful new Christmas. 

Of course I like BASW_me_4. I like where you have stopped it. I still like the way I met Nick - that was sexy! Also, I still think about telling Dave that he was going to get a surprise if his fingers went any higher and I still remember the look on his face when he did go higher. The "Rib Joint" episode was a very enjoyable adventure for me. That is what I try for when I misbehave -- some fun, some laughs, some good feelings and some good sex. And finally, a good story to come home and tell Gary and you. 

Have a warm thought for me sometime tomorrow. I know I'll have one for you.

I hope that this finds you and your family healthy and happy and enjoying the holidays. All is well here. No news - good or bad - to report. We have a very happy five-year old who hasn't tired of his new toys/games/books yet - - although mom and dad have tired of a few of them. 

I know it must be busy there with children and grandchildren, but I hope you are enjoying yourself. Write if you get a chance.

Pretty much the same here except multiplied by a factor of five where the children are concerned. Worse this year than most since the residue of the blizzard is still on the ground and the little buggers can't go outside and play for a while. It is amazing how months and months of shopping, wrapping and hiding presents from prying little eyes and hours of getting everything arranged under the tree can be turned into wreckage in just under twenty minutes. 

No story writing or typing stories into the computer for the last couple of days and it doesn't look much like I'll get any of it done before the first of the year. Take care sweetie and the very best to you and yours.

So glad to hear from you. I can't imagine 5 kids snowed in at Christmas time! Watch their caffeine and sugar intake! 

I know what you mean about all the preparations being gone in a flash. I told Gary that we should just wrap our boy's presents in newspaper - he wouldn't care and it is all confetti in a matter of minutes anyway. 

Did I tell you that Gary was a very NAUGHTY Santa? Obviously ignoring my statement of no more hanky-panky he gave me five sexy bra and panty sets and said he wanted a different man to see each of them on and off of me. It is a sickness! I don't think there is any help for the man, but I mean it!!!! No more little Miss (or Mrs.) Married Slut! 

I'm sure we will correspond before Monday so I'm not wishing you a Happy New Year yet. 

Love, 

Chris
