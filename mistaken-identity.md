Janice is treated like a teen 

 'Welcome everyone, to our Assertiveness Workshop. This is Janice, a new member. Would you like to say why you're here?' Charles asked. 

 'Err, OK. I'm here to learn, to be, err, more assertive, and less compliant,' she shyly spoke. 

 An older man was looking at her with interest, when she admitted to being compliant. He looked like trouble, so she would have to watch herself with him. 

 'What brought you here, I mean, was there a bad experience that convinced you to improve your attitude?' Roberto asked. 

 'Well, yes, I guess so. I was on vacation a last week. A bunch of adolescents bumped into me, and tripped me into the pool, where I lost my top. It was highly embarrassing, and of course I was angry with them. I should have done something about it. Instead, I felt foolish, and that it was my fault. I didn't do anything, or say anything, so they treated me as an easy target. I let things get terribly out of hand,' she said. 

 'You let a bunch of young guys take advantage of you?' Andrew eagerly asked. 

 'Yes. Err, not exactly, something like that,' she shyly spoke. 

 It was humiliating admitting to what he was suggesting. Too late now to take it back, as they would think she was covering up a dark secret. Although it was more complicated, it was somewhat true. The grin on his face revealed what he was thinking. The image of those rowdy teenage boys came to mind. The idea of them taking advantage of her, left her moist, and very self-conscious. 

 Janice knew it hadn't just got out of hand, the vacation was a complete disaster. Since they arrived home, Bernard, her husband, wasn't talking to her, and she wasn't talking to him. For once, she was trying hard not to capitulate to him. She was hoping this group might help her keep up the resolve to defy him. 

 *** 

 Janice was fetching the sun cream for her husband, Bernard, from the hotel room, when it happened. It was one of those small mistakes that easily occur, only she allowed it to escalate out of control. They'd had words over forgetting the sun cream, so she hurried back to the pool, wanting to keep him in a good mood. 

 Hurrying around a corner of a poolside building, she bumped into a group of rowdy teenagers. In surprise, she backed into one of the hotel entertainers. 

 'Sorry, miss,' she automatically said. 

 The girl was obviously younger than her, yet she deferred to the tall, well built girl. It was because she wore an entertainers uniform, a sign of authority, and the forceful way she spoke. 

 'You've just made it. Come on everyone, in the pool,' Helen loudly demanded. 

 Before Janice could separate herself from the group of eighteen-year-olds, she was nudged, barged, and finally tripped into the pool, to land with an ungainly splash. 

 'Help!' she gurgled, spitting a mouthful of chlorinated water. 'I can't swim,' she screeched in panic. 

 'Stand up, stupid,' a girl jeered. 

 Janice stood up, and immediately squatted down in the water. The top had come loose, and a most dreadful nightmare became real. Her little breasts were uncovered! Although short, she had a perfect body, except her small breasts, which filled her with shame. She scrabbled around in the water, catching sight of the top, only to lose it again, as the others scrabbled for the ball. 

 There was no way she could possibly climb out without the bikini top. She was in the pool among uncaring adolescents, being shoved around. They were all younger, yet bigger than her, so she kept out of their way, to avoid being drowned. It was something to be considered, as an alternative to being shamefully discovered. 

 Older people were watching them playing, from poolside loungers. Being seen by them, and her husband, would be terribly embarrassing, so she kept low. 

 The team girl blew a whistle for attention. 'Everyone, out of the water. Quickly!' 

 Janice was reluctant. She looked over at Bernard, face down on a lounger, burning. Damn! She needed his help, and badly so. There was no way she could call him, and bring attention to herself. 

 As soon as they were married he took over her life, organising everything she did. She never went to work from college, and when they moved closer to his new office, she lost contact with friends. It had been easier to give in, and let him do everything for her, until she hardly made any decisions at all. It was the reason she put up with wearing that padded bikini top, just to keep him happy. 

 She let out a whimper as her arm was grabbed, and she was pulled from the pool. 

 

 'Come on girl. Where's your top? Silly thing! Don't worry, I've got spare clothing in the club room,' Helen glibly said. 

 The entertainments girl had mistaken her for one of the group of teenagers, which wasn't unusual, especially as she was dressed in just a pair of brief shorts. Although she was twenty-six, she would be turned away from a bar, partly from only being five-four, but mainly because of a youthful complexion, with a baby face look. 

 Janice clutched her chest while being pulled along by the annoyingly enthusiastic girl. There was little choice, as the big strong girl had a vice like grip. She was in a daze of anguish. 

 There was no way she could walk over to Bernard, or even back to the room, revealing her body to ridicule. Nothing else was in her mind except covering up her small breasts. At least she'd been promised a top. Janice meekly followed, which had always been a bad habit. 

 They were not alone in the club house. The kids were making a racket in the changing room. Helen had the lucky job of looking after sullen teenagers, though at the moment they were boisterous. Janice could hear the guys in the showers calling to the girls, and one brave girl, or hussy, answering them. 

 'Not in there please. Can I get dressed out here, miss,' Janice meekly asked. 

 It was embarrassing letting the girl think she was a youngster, but it was a way of getting changed away from that rowdy group. Janice was small and waif like, with a personality to match. Unlike some short people she didn't have a loud voice, or a forceful personality. She kept a low profile, not wishing to be noticed. 

 The thought of joining those big teenagers in the changing room, brought back bad memories of high school. 

 'No need to be afraid of the big kids, I'm here,' Helen assured her. 

 Janice was miffed to be mistaken for a teen, even though she was used to it. It would be very embarrassing to admit she was a married woman, after losing her top when playing with those kids. They were around eighteen, and it was annoying that this stupid girl thought she was younger than them. 

 Helen sat down and pulled Janice in front of her. 'Best get those wet shorts off.' 

 Janice became aware of the new cotton shorts. They had shrunk! They were clinging to her like a second skin. She hadn't considered them at all, while consumed with fear over losing the top. Looking over her shoulder she checked everyone was busy in the showers. 

 'Don't worry girl, they won't bother you,' Helen said, in a condescending tone. 

 

 The entertainment girl was nearly six foot tall, and even while sitting she was taller than Janice. Janice felt overawed by her. She stood there wondering what to do. The bright and breezy girl was always in a hurry, and moved quickly. She grabbed Janice's wet shorts, and peeled them down, with panties tangled in them. 

 The action seemed natural enough, as though her mother were undressing her. A sudden wave of embarrassment awoke her, as though from a stupor. She became ashamedly aware of being naked in front of a stranger. She felt stupid to have allowed a young girl to strip off her last piece of clothing. She squirmed with embarrassment. She had a Brazilian for the vacation, leaving her feeling especially naked and vulnerable. 

 'Come on, don't dawdle, girl,' Helen hurried her. 

 At least she had the dress ready. It was ruffled up, ready to slip over Janice's head. She had to let go of her chest, to lift both arms straight up. Janice cringed with embarrassment, over showing off her small breasts to a stranger. The dress slipped down her arms to her head. 

 An awful feeling of uselessness swept over her, for stupidly letting this girl dress her like a kid. It was typical of her to let someone else take charge, and deferring to other peoples decisions had become a habit. 

 'Bugger, it's too small. It looked alright for you. Wait there and I'll get you something else,' she said. 

 Damn! Wait here? She wasn't going to wander off naked! 

 'Oh! Shit! I've lost the room key in the pool!' 

 Janice needed to get back to her husband for a key. He would be upset seeing her in those clingy shorts and nothing else. That is, if she could untangle the wet mess that had been her shorts. Oh! Shit! The uncaring girl had wandered off with them! 

 Janice wondered what was keeping the girl. Every second being naked was grinding away what was left of her self-respect. She imagined the girl telling her there was nothing in her size. Next to the big Nordic blond, she felt like small and pathetic. Especially when Helen had examined her denuded crotch and little breasts, with a look of disdain. 

 *** 

 Janice imagined being dragged by the hand by that strong Nordic girl, around the pool, back to her husband. With everyone looking at her nakedness, she would keep her head down in shame. Her husband would be livid. 

 'Your girl lost her clothes in the pool, playing with the other kids,' Helen would explain, in her loud commanding voice. 

 Helen still held her hand, so she had to stand naked in front of everyone, sobbing with shame. 

 'There, there, it's alright,' Helen said, with a demeaning tone of voice. 

 Helen popped a sweet in her mouth, and Janice choked on it. She was trying to apologise to her husband, sounding dismal through the sobs, and now lisped around the sweet. 

 Helen walked off, leaving her sobbing in front of everyone. 

 'I'wm, swowwy, I wiwy awm,' Janice heard herself say, and cringed. 

 'No, don't sit. Stand at attention and tell me what happened,' Bernard ordered. 

 Her husband was furious and was punishing her with humiliation. 

 She could see a couple of the eighteen year old guys ogling her. It was difficult to fool young people into thinking she was a teenager. They guessed she was a grown woman, and made no secret of enjoying her nakedness. 

 *** 

 A noise from the showers awoke her from the dream. Janice crouched on the bench, tightly rolled into a ball, trying not to be there. 

 It was her worst nightmare, being mistaken for a teenager. The respect received in adulthood came automatically to others her age, but she had to work at it. Like a few minutes ago in the pool, one silly mistake, and she was treated like one of the kids, forced to play games. 

 She looked over to where the noise was coming from with a look of dread. At least she wasn't in there being laughed at, like in high school. Sports days had been a nightmare. It was all very well Bernard mollifying her, by saying she had perfect china-doll skin. She longed to look like a mature married woman, not a doll. 

 The noisy teenagers piled into the main room. They were playing a ball game, with a prospect of handling not just the ball, but the girls too. Some of the girls let them. They quietened down to huddle in groups, making war plans. Who fancied whom, and why. 

 Damn! Why wasn't Bernard here to protect her? She was so used to him making the decisions for them both, it was difficult to know what to do. Here on vacation they were supposed to relax and enjoy the sun, yet on the first day it had already gone badly wrong. She scrunched up on a bench, hoping not to be noticed. 

 The two groups of eighteen year olds ignored her. They looked as though they were choosing teams, though it was pairing off with each other they were keenly discussing. 

 The damn girl returned, stopped to talk to them, and eventually came over to her. Janice wanted to shout at her to hurry up. She instead sat quietly huddled on a bench, with both arms desperately trying to cover her nakedness. 

 To Janice's horror Helen grabbed an arm, pulling her up off the bench. She was standing naked in a room full of strangers! Her mind went blank with fear. Helen was dressing her once more, only this time in front of a bunch of rowdy teenagers. 

 'Don't cry, I'll soon have you dressed ready to go and play,' Helen said, sounding condescending. 

 Janice clenched her fists, and only just held back hot tears of shame. The damn girl was laughing at her small waif like body. With small breasts, and cleanly denuded of pubic hair, she looked like a young teen. Especially to this big boned, Nordic giant. 

 She was about to point out she could dress herself, when the guys noticed her, and made the usual disparaging remarks. 

 'That one's yours, Billy,' a guy loudly spoke. 

 'Not for me, she's got no tits,' Billy laughed. 

 Janice froze, with mouth firmly clamped shut. She thought she was past all that, after leaving school and getting married. She screwed up her fists, ready to assert she was an adult, and a married woman, not just a kid like them. How could she say anything while naked and vulnerable. They wouldn't believe her, and would make even more fun of the mad girl. 

 She waited for the girls to join in, knowing they were the cruellest. To her surprise the girls rallied around to her defence. 

 'Leave the kid alone,' one of the girls said. 

 Helen managed to get the dress over her head this time. They had all seen her bare bottom, and everything else, while being pulled around. She felt like a helpless doll, being dressed by a big strong girl. She wanted to run away crying in shame, like the pathetic thing they thought she was. 

 'Don't be cruel you guys. She'll develop soon, and you'll be sorry you made fun of her,' one of the girls scolded them. 

 Janice wished it were true. She went through this before, hoping every day to grow taller, and for her bust to develop. There was no way she could possibly stand up now and declare she was a mature, married woman. They would just laugh at her. Even if they believed her, it would be unbearable to hear the gossip going around the hotel. 

 The insults went on for a moment or two, until they lost interest and started to leave. 

 'What do you say? For the dress,' Helen insisted. 

 Janice looked as though she would burst into tears. Nevertheless, she rallied round to do as she was told. 

 'Thank you, Miss, for dressing me, and giving me this dress,' Janice said, sounding pathetic. 

 'You're welcome, young lady,' Helen brightly beamed. 

 'Maria, could you fix the girls' hair. It's drying into a mess,' Helen said. 

 'Like sure, Helen, it'll be fun,' Maria answered. 

 Two of the girls took hold of her arms, almost dragging her to the changing room, and sat her down on a plastic chair. Her feet swung an inch off the floor, leaving her feeling like a kid sister. They were too strong for her to fight, so as usual she gave in, hoping they knew what they were doing. Her makeup had been washed off in the pool so she needed, 'fixing-up', as they called it. 

 The two eighteen year olds were taller with more developed figures, giving the impression they were older sisters. She wished so much to look like them, with a full hourglass figure. It would have helped her confidence, changed her personality, maybe influenced her whole life. 

 They washed her hair, which at least would cleanse it of the pool's chlorine, and bring back the shine. Shampoo got in her eyes, and the vigorous rubbing flipped her contacts out. They at least looked for them, though they probably trod them into the wet floor. 

 'I can't see without them,' Janice complained, sounding upset. 

 'Don't worry, we'll go through the lost property and find you a pair of glasses,' Maria tried to reconcile her. 

 They were being kind to her, rather than chide her for having a flat chest, as girls had at high school. She settled down under their care, feeling the tension ease. It was nice having them take care of her. She once more felt protected, and left them to decide the hair style. With make-up on, she always felt her age, and properly dressed. 

 At last they were finished, and stood back to admire their handiwork. 

 'Like great, don't you think?' Maria asked her friend. 

 'Yea, much better than looking like a drowned rat,' the other girl laughed. 

 'Thanks, Maria, thanks, Megan. I really appreciate your help,' Janice said. 

 She was wondering if this is what it would be like to have sisters. At that moment she felt wonderful. She even enjoyed feeling like a sister to these two big girls. 

 They brought her a box of glasses form the lost property cupboard, and she tried one pair after another. At last her vision cleared, though not perfectly. She was grateful to be able to walk out of there without bumping into everyone, and everything. 

 The warm feeling was still with her, as she accepted their praise. 

 'You look cute, Janice. It would be fun if you were my sister. I'd fix you up every day,' Maria gushed. 

 'Thanks. I'd love to be your sister. Are you going to be a make-up artist?' Janice asked. 

 'Don't know yet, maybe,' Maria said. 

 The feeling of warmth between them heartened her. 

 'You should work at it. You can fix me up every day if you like,' Janice offered. 

 'Like, OK. You can be my sister while at the hotel, alright?' Maria asked. 

 'Sure, that would be great,' Janice smiled. 

 Janice walked to the door with them, ready to face the outside world. At last she could get back to her husband, get the key, and change her clothes. As she approached the door a girl appeared in front of her. She stepped to one side, and the girl did likewise. 

 'Sorry,' Janice said, to the awkward girl. 

 The two big girls laughed at her, seeing Janice apologise to her reflection. She felt a fool speaking to a mirror. She gasped in surprise. The glasses weren't perfect, but she saw enough to find the image disturbing. 

 Her hair was pulled away from her face and tied in two pigtails, sporting pink ribbons. It was a darker shade of brown, mousy brown she guessed. When she moved her head, the pigtails bounced around over her ears. They had dotted her cheeks with freckles, and she hoped it wasn't the brown hair dye. The heavy black glasses, with thick lenses, made her look geeky. 

 The bright pink dress had a band of elastic under her breasts, emphasising a lack of anything much. It flared out from her chest, to float around her thighs. The air conditioning clicked in, with the light breeze ballooning up the light hem, showing off her bare crotch. 

 'What, what, have you done to me?' she quietly spoke. 

 It wasn't her nakedness that worried her, it was the image that was so gripping. The picture of a girl shook her, leaving her head spinning. It didn't seem real. 

 She thought of herself as a mature, adult woman. Since being married she enjoyed the freedom and responsibilities of adulthood. She enjoyed going to dinner parties, the theatre, opera and ballet. She always made a point of dressing in sophisticated clothing to emphasis her age. The sophistication of adulthood had been stripped away, to leave in its place a young geeky teenager. 

 

 'Like, nice. You look so cute, like, yea?' Maria asked, wanting praise for her handiwork. 

 Janice's hair, make-up, contact lenses, clothes, designer shoes, padded push-up bra, and her status, had been stripped away. It was as though her adult life was nothing more than a fantasy, so as to get through the awkward teenage stage. She had strived to leave that awkward period of her life behind, only for it to be resurrected. 

 Instead of an attractive twenty-six year old woman, she saw a geeky girl, looking diffident and gauche. Her significance as a mature woman had been stolen from her by these two girls. They thought they were doing her a favour, by giving her a make-over that would look good on a young girl.  

 

 

===

Instead, they'd made her feel small and insignificant. 

 'Like, a great look, yea?' the girls fished for compliments. 'You look just like that girl, Candy, on TV!' they told her. 

 She had no idea who they were referring to. Before she could think what to do, they ushered her out into the bright sunshine. She rapidly blinked her eyes, no longer used to wearing lenses. 

 'Hello girls. Helen said Janice was here. Have you seen her?' Bernard asked. 

 Janice cringed on hearing his voice. She tried so hard to live up to his expectations. Now he would be embarrassed from the way she looked. She always wore high heels, sophisticated clothes, and was careful with her makeup, so as not to look out of place as his wife. He was five years older, yet now she looked over ten years younger than him. 

 He wouldn't see the funny side, he would be furious. 

 'Here she is, sir. We gave your daughter a makeover. Do you like it?' Maria asked. 

 Bernard looked at the girl they presented with a look of disbelief. 'Janice?' he lamely asked. 

 'Sorry, UNCLE. I lost my clothes in the pool, UNCLE,' she said. 

 The deception, calling him uncle, was meant to get them both off the hook, until they could get back to the room. Feeling like an idiot could be endured if he was able to see the funny side, and not become angry with her. She silently pleaded that he kept his head, and played along. 

 'Oh, like, she's your niece. What do you think of the make-over?' the girls again looked for compliments. 

 'Yes, it's certainly different. Thank you, you've done a great job,' he murmured. 

 The two girls walked away happy to have helped, not knowing they had left Janice in trouble with her husband. 

 'What do you mean, you lost your clothes in the pool?' Bernard demanded. 

 'Let's just go back to the room. I'll explain then,' Janice groaned. 

 She wanted to shout at him to get a move on. 

 'Why on earth did you let those girls dress you up like this? You should stick up for yourself and do what YOU want. You're always letting people take the lead. This is what happens when you give in to other people,' he lectured. 

 Janice felt like pointing out that he wouldn't like it if she put her foot down, and would soon be in a mood if she didn't give in to him. 

 'So you found her?' Sandra interrupted. 

 'Yes, Janice, err, my niece,' he hesitantly introduced his wife. 

 'So it was your niece you were looking for,' the woman cheerily spoke. 'Those pink ribbons in her hair look so cute, and they match the dress perfectly. What an adorable girl,' the woman said, while squinting at her. 

 'I was looking for you, and Sandra pointed me in the direction of Helen, the entertainments girl,' he explained to Janice. 

 'Now you've found her, we can all go to lunch, I'm starving,' Sandra said, and linked her arm in Bernard's. 

 'I need to go to my room, to change,' Janice complained. 

 'You're uncle was worried about you. No wandering off again young lady,' Sandra admonished her. 'This is Roy and Emily, say hello to Janice,' Sandra said, not meaning to be condescending. 

 'Sorry about mom. She likes children, but can't cope with teenagers. It's annoying how she treats us like kids. Too vain to wear her glasses, so you're a bit fuzzy,' Emily laughed. 'We try and keep out of her way on vacation,' Emily warned. 

 'Where are you? Are, there you are. Be a good girl and stay close,' Sandra beamed. 

 Janice was about to slide away from them, only to remember she didn't have a room key. Wandering around dressed like a teenager was embarrassing. At least amongst a family group no one would notice her. The woman grabbed Janice's hand, and moved them all toward the restaurant. 

 'Sandra is right, you had better do as you are told, and keep close,' her husband said. He gave her a furtive shrug, and whispered a warning, 'I don't know what you're playing at, but you got yourself into this, so get yourself out of it. Just don't embarrass me.' 

 Janice was fuming. He could see she needed to change out of the terrible getup, and he certainly knew why. He knew full well how sensitive she was about her age and build. She kept glancing at him with a killing look, only he avoided it. The large busty woman propelled them along to a large circular table. 

 A waiter turned up with menus, giving them one each. 

 'This is a kids menu,' Janice said, pointing out his error. 

 'Your uncle isn't going to buy you a lunch you won't eat. I know what they're like Bernard. They see things, but won't eat it once put in front of them. Janice, will have the fish shapes,' Sandra told the waiter. 

 The woman's two children were laughing at her. What could she do without giving the game away, and showing up her husband. She buried her reddening face behind the menu. She was hungry, and figured after lunch the ghastly family could be left behind, and well forgotten. 

 Fish shapes duly arrived with fries and beans, and they didn't taste too bad. Roy nudged her elbow, spilling tomato sauce over the table cloth. 

 'Look what you're doing girl. Is she going through an awkward stage?' Sandra asked. 

 Bernard mumbled something in reply, but no-one was listening. 

 'Sorry, miss,' Janice murmured. 

 'Here, try this, it might help,' Sandra ordered. 

 Janice choked on a mouthful of fries. The woman lifted her chin, and tied a napkin around her neck. She felt as though she were wearing a bib. She was trying to tell Bernard to do something with urgent signals, only he just sat there like a useless lump. 

 'So where's your wife, at home, leaving you to cope with your niece?' Sandra prompted. 

 'No wife at the moment,' Bernard said, looking meaningfully at Janice. 

 'At the moment? Well I'm divorced, so look out Bernard,' she laughed. 

 Janice was astonished at the woman's audacity. The tasteless woman was flirting with Bernard, in front of her, his wife. Of course Sandra didn't know she was his wife, but it was still infuriating. She kept giving her husband mean looks, only it backfired. He began to flirt right back at the damn woman, in defiance. The fancy cocktails helped him along. 

 'Finish up your lunch, Janice, like a good girl. Then you can go and play with the other children,' he smirked. 

 He gave her a big smile in retaliation to her irritable looks. He was punishing her for getting into the mix-up, and was leaving her to stew in her own mess. The woman's flirting was so outrageously obvious, it seemed comical. He was enjoying it, even though the overbearing woman wasn't his type. Janice sat back to watch the amusing pantomime. 

 One consolation was that she got to choose a huge ice cream desert. Before she could tuck in, the damn woman grabbed her face. 

 'Here honey, let me wipe off the sauce,' she said. 

 Janice felt herself sliding back to a time when her mother did the exact same thing. She looked at the two kids who were smirking at her. They were eighteen, but she was an adult, being treated worse than them. If her husband wasn't going to help her out of this mess, she was going to make the most of it. 

 She tucked into the ice cream, trying to ignore the woman's incessant chatter. 

 'Perhaps you would like to escort me to the show tonight, it's supposed to be very good,' the woman said. 

 At this Janice couldn't help retaliating. She smeared ice cream around her mouth and poked her tongue out at her husband. The other two laughed, attracting the mother's attention, who caught her at it. 

 'That's enough of that sweetie. You should show your uncle respect. Look at the state of you!' she scolded. 

 This time the woman pulled her off the chair to wipe her face and dress, where ice cream had dripped. 

 'What the heck?' Sandra exclaimed. 

 The dress became caught as she was pulled from the chair. Her dress was up, revealing her nakedness. 

 'Did you know your niece is running around without knickers?' she asked Bernard, in a scathing tone. 

 The loudness of her voice was an added embarrassment. Guests would have heard the assertion a few tables away. She was pretty sure the woman's children saw her bare bottom. Others sitting close by had seen her front and back. Well, it wasn't the first time today all had been revealed. Here in a restaurant it was more humiliating, and the woman was broadcasting her shame. 

 'You must be mistaken,' Bernard whispered. 

 He wanted to ignore the unwelcome idea of his wife's bare ass being exposed. 

 'Look for yourself,' Sandra said. 

 Janice was stunned when the woman tugged the dress up around her hips. She stood in the middle of a busy restaurant, showing off her naughty bits. In a panic, she tried to pull away, only to entangle the dress around the woman's hand. 

 'Bernard! Stop this damn woman, she's making a spectacle of me,' she angrily hissed at her husband. 

 'That's no way to speak to your uncle, young lady,' Sandra admonished. 

 Nevertheless the impetuous woman realised what she had done, and pulled the dress into place. With head down, Janice stood in shame. Her husband sat looking stunned, which quickly turned to anger. He glared at his wife, not at Sandra. 

 'You're too old to run around naked. What happened to your panties?' Sandra demanded. 

 'Yes, why aren't you wearing panties, Janice?' Bernard asked, with an appalled look on his face. 

 She couldn't answer, and resorted to a convenient teenage sulkiness. 

 'Perhaps she wet them,' Sandra whispered. 

 Janice closed her eyes tight, and counted to ten. 

 'That seems likely. Did you pee in your panties, Janice?' Bernard asked. 

 Of course he knew she hadn't, but couldn't help digging at her, as a sort of retribution. There was a definite anger in his voice. She was losing the challenge she started, when making funny faces at him. This was going too far. He was pushing her into the mire. She felt like running to their room and packing for home. 

 She took a deep breath, and considered the options. He had the room key, and the flight wasn't for another six days. The only way was to brazen it out. 

 As soon as possible she would wash out the hair dye, put on a push up padded bra, an elegant dress, high heels, and sophisticated make-up. She knew how to dress to emphasis her adult status, even if her stature let her down. 

 It was no good, she couldn't stand any more of this farce. Her temper broke, before the tears had a chance to fall. 

 'Bernard, just give me the damn room key,' Janice crossly spoke. 

 'I warned you young lady. You're uncle isn't used to controlling wayward girls, so I will. Alright, Bernard?' Sandra asked. 

 Bernard had been amused at first, even enjoying her discomfort. Now he was furious to find she was running around without panties. What in hell had she been up to? 

 Letting anger get the better of him, he said, 'Yes, go ahead.' 

 He hadn't stopped to think what Sandra meant, otherwise he wouldn't have been so quick to agree. 

 Janice was standing next to the woman, so she had no time to react. She was over the woman's knee, feeling a stinging smack to her bare bottom. If she had run away, there was nowhere to go, though anywhere away from the stupid woman would be fine. 

 In a public place, and before her husband, she was being spanked! 

 'That's for being messy,' she said. 'This is for cheeking your uncle,' she emphasised, with two stinging slaps. Two more slaps, were accompanied by her saying, 'These are for not wearing panties.' 

 The woman stood her up, and straightened the dress. 

 'Now young lady, will you behave yourself?' Sandra demanded. 

 'Yes, ma'am, sorry, ma'am,' Janice meekly apologised. 

 There were tears in her eyes, partly from anger and frustration, also from feeling so pathetic. There was no way she was going to chance being spanked again. It was appalling to feel so crushed, and so small. It was no longer a silly ruse to save face. She capitulated to the big strong mother figure, showing it plainly in her voice and demeanour. 

 'Apologise to your uncle for being such a naughty girl,' the woman demanded. 

 'Sorry uncle, for being a naughty girl, and running around without panties,' she said, in a trembling whispery voice. 

 Bernard didn't know what to say. He watched his wife being spanked in public, with a plain look of astonishment plastered over his face. At least she hadn't screamed and kicked out, making a bigger spectacle of herself. Those sitting at the tables around them had noticed, but the rest of the restaurant had missed his wife's humiliation. How could he tell Sandra to leave his wife alone, after that. It looked as though Janice didn't want the truth revealed either. 

 Emily came back to the table and dangled a pair of panties in her face. It was a surprise, as she hadn't noticed her leaving. It was embarrassing to once more find herself being dressed. She was shoved all over the place, as the woman pulled the panties up her legs. They were too small, which was unusual. 

 The woman held up the dress showing off her panties to Bernard. Her son, and others at nearby tables were staring at her. The small panties had been heaved up to fit tight. She could feel a prominent camel-toe where they hugged her pussy. Anyone sitting behind her would have a fine view of her bottom, with the panties splitting her cheeks. Her breasts may be inadequate, but she was proud of her cute, heart shaped bottom, though not enough to show it off in a public place. 

 'She's a sweet young lady, isn't she Bernard,' Sandra commented. 

 'Yes, she's a sweet thing,' Bernard returned, sounding resigned. 

 Her husband no longer sounded angry with her, rather, he looked fed-up and disappointed with her. Again she merely stood there dumbfounded, feeling all the more like a naughty girl. 

 'Are you a mummy's girl, or a daddy's girl?' the woman asked. 

 Forced to play along for just a little longer, Janice gritted her teeth. At least the horrid woman had patted down the dress. 

 'A mummy's girl,' she answered. 

 'Oh! That's so cute,' Sandra smiled, and lifted Janice onto her lap. 

 Janice gaped at her husband, pleading with him to do something. He had punished her by playing along with the charade, and not taking her back to the room. He was bound to say it was her fault for starting it, but enough was enough. 

 'You see, Bernard. Sometimes you've got to punish them, to enforce limits. Look how well your niece behaves now,' Sandra stated. 

 The woman hugged her tight, pushing her face into a deep cleavage. Janice was appalled, but she wasn't going to risk another spanking, so tamely sat there. 

 Bernard stared at her, and shook his head in wonder. His wife's bare bottom had been spanked in front of everyone in the entire restaurant. Now she was sitting on the woman's lap, forced to accept a cuddle. The woman was flirting with her husband and forcing her into a subordinate role. It seemed the dragon had won. 

 'I think you should thank Sandra for the panties,' Bernard said, while staring her out. 

 While she was in such a vulnerable position, she had no option except to do as she was told. 

 'Yes, sir. Sorry for being a rude girl, ma'am. Thank you for the panties, ma'am,' she said, sounding contrite. 

 She should have been furious with both of them, especially with her husband, for letting the woman humiliate her so badly. The woman had spanked her to keep her quiet, so she could carry on flirting with Bernard. She wanted to laugh at the mixed up situation, only she might become hysterical. The woman would probably slap her, or even spank her again. 

 Janice sat quietly at the table waiting for them to finish their meal. She dare not move or say a word. She felt ridiculous. The pink outfit and make-up was bad enough. The bitch was trying to steal her husband right in front of her, and all she could do was tamely sit there. It was adding insult to injury. 

 'Uncle, can I go and play? Please, uncle,' she demurely asked. 

 'You sound like a nicely brought up young lady when you behave yourself. Now go and play with my children,' she told Janice. 'Look after Janice you two, I don't want her wandering off and getting lost, like she did before,' Sandra added. 

 Escaping the woman was a relief. 

 Emily took hold of a hand, leading her away from the awful situation. As they left the restaurant, Janice felt afraid. She was losing the protection of her husband, her only link to adulthood. Not that he had been of the slightest help at all. She looked up at the girl holding her hand, feeling small and awkward, as though she really was an adolescent. 

 'I told you to watch out for mom. She goes over the top sometimes. Without her glasses she couldn't see you're the same age as us. We'll stick together and keep out of her way,' Emily promised. 

 'Thanks, that sounds like a good idea,' Janice agreed. 

 She was in a deep funk, trying to come to terms with what happened. It was her worst nightmare, being treated like a teenager. Being spanked in public was the most horrible moment of her life. It would haunt her dreams for some time to come. 

 'You're about our age aren't you? Over eighteen,' Emily guessed. 

 'Yes,' she replied. 

 'She won't wear her glasses, so she took you for being much younger,' Emily said, trying to console her. 

 'Thanks. How old do I look?' she asked. 

 'Don't worry, we can see your eighteen, like us. Roy and I are twins,' Emily said. 

 Janice relaxed with the girl. After all, she was trying to be nice, and making a good attempt at helping her feel better. 

 'I need to get changed. Damn! I didn't get a key to our room,' she cursed. 

 'You look alright. Pretty, and cute,' she laughed. 

 Janice managed to laugh along with her. 'It's really not my style. I guess I'm stuck with it until I can get into my room,' she explained. 

 'How did you lose your panties?' Emily asked. 

 'That would be telling,' she ribbed the girl. 'These panties wouldn't fit you, they're too small. Where did you get them?' she asked. 

 'From the lost property bin,' Emily laughed. 'Sorry!' 

 'Yuck! This dress came from there. At least they're clean,' she said. 

 'You're not a girl, you're a woman, aren't you,' Emily said. 

 'How do you know?' she prevaricated. 

 'There's something about you. Despite what happened you have confidence,' Emily thought out loud. 

 'I'm not feeling confident inside. I feel weak and pathetic, for letting all that happen,' she admitted. 

 'Stick with us, and we'll have some fun. Here we are,' Emily announced. 

 It didn't look much. They walked into a darkened room, with teenagers milling about. A group of guys looked them over. 

 'Look after her while I get a drink ,' Emily told her brother. 

 He didn't look as though he could look after himself, let alone anyone else. 

 'Here, try this,' Emily said. 

 Janice smelt the familiar odour of alcohol in the orange juice. She needed it right then, to wash away the bad taste of lunchtime. She downed the vodka and held out the plastic cup for another. 

 'Here, take mine,' Roy said. 

 It was the first words she heard him utter since they met. She looked him over, seeing a nice young man. He was well built, with a deep tone to his voice. He gave her the once over in return, but didn't seem impressed. 

 A group of guys walked over, with a swagger suggesting they owned the place. 

 'Hi you two, haven't seen you in here before,' one of them said to Janice. 

 The vodka hit her brain, numbing the chance of a snappy reply. A put down was forming in her mind, but refused to reach her mouth. What kind of vodka was in that juice? 

 'She's with Roy. I'm not with anyone,' Emily brazenly told them. 

 The older one of them, obviously the leader, pointed to the others, and they drifted away. One of them stayed to chat with Emily. She flashed her eyes at him, determined to try out her flirting techniques. 

 'That leaves you and me,' the leader of the gang said. 

 It sounded more like a threat than a welcome.  

 

 

===

'I'm with Roy,' Janice nervously spoke. 

 The young guy was tall and mean looking. She would have the confidence to see him off, when dressed in a business suit, with make-up and high heels. Dressed like a teen, in flats, she felt small and vulnerable. She wrapped an arm around Roy, pulling him tight. Roy flinched, as though wanting nothing to do with her. 

 'Doesn't look like it to me,' the rough looking yob said. 

 'We had an argument, but we're going to make it up,' she stammered. 

 Janice was desperate. She reached up to Roy and kissed him. The guy folded his arms, and gave her a sideways grin. He didn't believe her, and wasn't going anywhere. 

 She put her arms around Roy, and smooched him full on. Feeling his tongue enter her mouth wasn't what she wanted, but she would have to put up with it. He took his time kissing her. It was nice, despite him only being eighteen. The kiss wasn't hurried, or fumbling with inexperience, and his lips were dry. His lips were soft, and he didn't choke her with his tongue. 

 His arms were holding her, not groping as might be expected of a teenager. Her body began to tingle all over. The vodka was strong, and she wasn't used to drinking. Unable to get served in a bar, or restaurant, had put her off alcohol altogether. Just in case the guy was still there, she continued kissing him. Kissing him back to keep his interest was necessary; wasn't it? 

 She began to question what in hell she was doing! Out the corner of an eye, she could see Emily smooching a boy. It was like being back in high school, only she wasn't being left out. It was no longer her being left on the bench. She kissed him with a little more enthusiasm, and didn't complain when he gently held her bottom. He pulled her tight against him, and their bodies almost became one. They were closely writhing together, slowly, but surely, and passionately. 

 He bit her lips and kissed her neck, while she kissed his. He ground his hardness against her. She knew she should stop this, but the tingling sensation had turned to passion. Even more reason to stop, though making it all the more difficult. They were only kissing. It was better than letting that big rough guy haul her off somewhere. The thought of being led away by the bad boy gang leader, stoked her up. 

 Roy's hands slid up the dress, to cup her cheeks. She would have to put a stop to that; eventually. A little more playing around would be alright, just to make sure that ruffian left her alone. The tight panties couldn't be pulled down easily, so she let his hands wander. 

 Damn! There was no excuse! She was a married woman letting a guy fondle her. 

 His hands were tenderly stroking her bottom. It was so delicious she couldn't stop it. Her breathing came in gasps. Her heart was pounding. It hadn't felt like this since the early days with Bernard. Not that she dare think of that, or him. She was on tiptoe, held up by a strong young man, with his arms engulfing her. 

 She didn't feel pathetic, or vulnerable now. 

 'You've had your turn, now fuck off,' the ruffian said. 

 He'd returned with a couple of friends. 

 They leered at Janice, thinking she was a little slut. She had behaved that way, so must be. 

 'I told you to move it,' he repeated. 

 He grabbed Janice, wrapping an arm around her waist. 

 'Go get Bernard,' she yelped. 

 She hoped Bernard would still be at the restaurant, as it didn't look as though this nasty lout was going to wait around. She'd read about gang sluts in a Sunday magazine. They were either girls joining a local gang, or were forced into it. The gang members would share the girl, using her to satisfy their lust. After awhile, the girls became used to it, and no longer tried to get away from the gang. Being a slut became a way of life. 

 A look of fear crossed her face. She wondered how long it would take her to become a slut, and accept it as a way of life. A less discernible emotion replaced the fear. It revealed arousal, from the thought of being carried off, and used. She was a little drunk and very stoked up by Roy. That was a poor excuse for the naughty fantasy. 

 Roy pushed at one of the boys, or so it seemed, when the boy fell backwards. Another crack at the second one, and he too went tumbling. The arm movement was too quick to properly see. He turned toward the leader, who was still holding Janice, with strong arms wrapped tight around her. The guy stopped kissing her neck when Roy took a step toward him. The guy pushed her toward Roy, and backed off. His two friends sidled away. 

 Janice grabbed hold of Roy, and reached up to kiss him. 

 'Thank you Roy, thank you so much. I thought they were going to carry me away, to be a gang slut, or something,' she said, on a heaving breath. 

 Perhaps she should have kept quiet about the fantasy. She was nevertheless very pleased to be rescued. At last someone big and strong was looking out for her, which she badly needed. She swayed a little, from the shock, and the vodka. A heady mix. 

 'I don't think so,' he frowned. 

 'I read about it. They grab girls, and force them to be gang sluts,' she spouted. 

 He didn't remind her they were just families on vacation at the hotel, and not a mean gang from the wrong side of the tracks. 

 She reached up for another kiss. He gripped her tight, lifting her off the ground, smooching her for even longer than before. She was breathless, and still thankful for his manly rescue. 

 'Come on you two, were going,' Emily told them, with a dig in Janice's ribs. 

 The two love birds pulled their heads apart, not their bodies. Janice saw in his eyes a look of admiration, if not love. They sparkled dangerously. He tenderly kissed her lips, and she wondered if she had that same silly look on her face. The feeling that he was her hero was difficult to shake off. 

 Coming up for air, Janice asked. 'Who's your new friend?' 

 'Andrew. He's a good kisser, but too grabby. He might do, I'll see,' Emily grinned. 

 'Did you see what your bother did?' she enthused. 

 'I told you he would look after us. He's a black belt in something or other, some foreign word,' Emily said. 

 Roy lifted his eyebrows, but said nothing, as usual. 

 Janice slipped her arm around his waist, and was pleased to feel him hold onto her. It wasn't just because she was unsteady on her feet. The four of them walked arm in arm as couples. The sun was setting, throwing shadows and dappled light through the trees. Tiny fairy lights flickered on in the trees, adding to the romantic scene. 

 Damn! What in hell was she doing? Kissing a boy might be justified, to get back at her husband for letting her down this afternoon. Leading on such a nice boy as Roy, was all wrong. He took a firm grip of her waist, and followed his sister with her new boyfriend. It was getting dark, and they were walking hip to hip toward the sound of loud music. 

 'We'll find those two and get the room keys,' Emily said, over her shoulder. 

 Janice was linked up with a boy, and it felt right. The four of them were sharing a romantic evening, like a prom night, or holiday romance. A slight shiver ran down her spine. When she thought of what her husband was going to say, she heavily sighed. He would call her stupid, and justifiably so. She would have to let Roy down carefully, after that moment of madness in the youth club. Putting off the moment, she continued to enjoy his arms engulfing her, feeling safe and comforted at last. After the horrible experience at lunchtime, she needed someone to care for her. 

 Emily looked over the crowd, trying to spot her mother, and Bernard. 

 'There they are,' she pointed. 

 Janice was a bit wobbly, but focused enough to spot them. They looked a little fuzzy through the glasses. They were sitting close, and the woman was talking in his ear. It was a noisy show, but Janice didn't have to like how close they were. They laughed together, and the woman gave him a peck on the cheek. He kissed her back. Damn! The hussy had been flirting with her husband all afternoon, and now the bitch was moving in on him. 

 'I'm going to watch the show,' Janice said. 

 The others shrugged and followed her through the crowd. There were no seats near her husband, and no-one was giving way. A couple told them to go down the front, where the kids sat on the floor. Janice grimaced, but let Roy pull her through the throng. Bernard was sure to see her in the damnable pink dress, and would have to behave himself. 

 They made a space for themselves, and sat down. Janice turned around and scowled at her husband, but he was too engrossed with the flirty woman. He could hold his drink, though it looked as though they had continued after lunch, and were still knocking them back. 

 Emily nudged her, putting a plastic cup in her hand. In a temper she downed it, and choked. 

 'What the hell was in that?' she demanded. 

 'Strong Polish Vodka, like the others,' Emily grinned. 'We were supposed to share it,' she added. 

 Janice felt it hit, adding to the already heady feeling. She tried to turn around to spy on her husband, only to heavily fall against Roy. He put an arm around her to steady her. 

 'I'm drunk,' she murmured. She snuggled into his arms, with her head resting on his shoulder. 

 'I can see that,' he said. 

 He pulled her tight, and kissed her, exploring her mouth with his tongue. When he came up for air, she tried to tell him something. 

 'We shouldn't be doing it,' she slurred. 

 'We're not doing IT,' he pointed out. 

 She giggled, and let him kiss her again. 'This will teach him to flirt with that nasty woman,' she murmured. 

 Roy pushed a hand up the dress while kissing her. As a married woman she shouldn't be kissing anyone, let alone a teenager. As an adult woman she should have been prepared, and easily able to deal with him. It wasn't just a lack of experience, from only having Bernard as a boyfriend, and then as her husband. Nor was it a need for settling a score with him, for kissing that woman. There was something else going on, other than the alcohol muddling her mind. 

 'Come on you two, we had better get back,' Emily said. 

 She'd got a key from her mom, while Roy and Janice were busy wrapped up in each other. Andrew, the new boyfriend, quietly tagged along. 

 Janice was too far gone to see Bernard and the woman eyeing each other up, preparing to make a move. Emily and Roy pulled her through the audience, and half carried her to their room. 

 'Shush, keep quiet,' Emily warned her. 

 Janice giggled, and with her back to the door, kissed Roy goodnight. She relaxed what little guard she still had, now that she was safely back. Just a kiss to thank him for saving her from those rough boys, and then a retreat to safety into her own room, at last. 

 'If my uncle can make out with your mom, then I can with you,' she giggled. 

 Emily shook her head and rolled her eyes in exasperation. She reached behind the silly girl and opened the door. Roy and Janice tumbled in, still holding on to each other. 

 'Help me get her undressed,' Emily said. 'Andrew, my room's in there.' 

 'Leave me, I can get undressed,' she mumbled, and fell laughing onto the bed. 

 'Take her to your room, I'll be in trouble when mom gets in,' he said. 

 'I'll be busy,' she leered at her brother. 

 Emily figured her mother wouldn't be back tonight. He wasn't complaining very much either. The girl was drunk, and Emily didn't want Janice peeing on her tonight. Besides, she had plans with Andrew. 

 'Are you on the pill? Alright then. Do you want to stay here in Roy's bed?' she heavily asked. 

 'Mmm, yes, Roy can look after me,' Janice sighed. 

 Janice's eyes were closed but she was still functioning, just about. Just to make sure, Emily asked again. 

 'You OK, sleeping in Roy's bed?' Emily asked again, to make it clear. 

 'Mmm, yes, sure,' Janice answered, with a slur. 

 'Don't wake me till ten,' Emily said, and sloped off. 

 She peered back at her brother, and shook her head. He was standing there wondering what to do with the silly girl. She wasn't going to give him a diagram. All that would happen is that he would wake up in a pool of piss. 

 'You OK?' Roy asked. 

 'Cuddle me,' she demanded. 

 He slipped his clothes off, except for his shorts, and pulled the sheets over them. 

 He nervously put his arms around her waist, and she snuggled up. He had never had a girl in his bed, or even been this close to one in just her panties. His cock was hard, and of its own violation, nestled against her bottom. Realising how close it was to her naughty bits, he needed to pull away. He froze on feeling her push back upon him. 

 She wriggled as though getting comfortable, maybe not wanting to feel his hardness digging into her. She put a hand behind her, and wrapped it around his cock. It was still tucked away in his pants, but no less thrilling to have someone else's hand gripping it for a change. She moaned, wriggled some more, and pulled it out. Her hand was now wrapped around his cock, for real! 

 He moved his hands up to her breasts to cup them. He gently played with them, rolled her nipples, and kissed the back of her neck. 

 His cock knew what to do, even if he didn't. He pushed forward, sliding it between her panty clad cheeks. She squirmed around, until his cock slipped further down. He wasn't aware of pressing it against a sensitive place, but she was. 

 Janice mumbled something. It was meant to be words of forgiveness to her husband. She wanted him to forgive her, and was offering herself in compensation. She didn't want that horrible woman to have him. She needed him. She reached between her legs and pulled the panty crotch to one side. She manoeuvred herself against him, trying to capture his penis. He wasn't helping, and for an awful moment she thought he didn't want her. 

 Her head was like cotton wool. She couldn't think, or work out why he wasn't taking her. She was offering herself to her husband, and he was rejecting her! He must still be angry with her. 

 'Please, make love to me, darling,' she slurred. 

 Roy didn't believe what he was hearing. He pushed forward, feeling her wet flesh, guessing it must be her sex he was pushing against. He was unsure if he was taking advantage of her, and certainly didn't want to do that. From the moment that guy tried to pull her away from him, he felt a connection. She kissed nice too. There was a certain something about her, as though she was older, with experience of life. She was enchanting. 

 Feeling his cock part her lips was delicious. She pressed back, pushing herself upon him, capturing the head of his cock. A strong desire of wanting to feel full of his cock was overpowering. When he slammed into her she cried out. He was squeezing her breasts, which she didn't like, as it reminded her how small they were. 

 His pace was fast and furious, instead of careful and tender. He was punishing her for being such a stupid woman. Did he know that she had smooched that boy? Her body and mind caught up with the enthusiastic screwing. She began to pant in time with his thrusts. She moved her hips slightly for a different angle, and gasped. His cock was rubbing her g-spot with every deep thrust! 

 'Keep going, fuck me hard, darling, I'm nearly there,' she whimpered. 

 She felt him spurt his cum, and it felt like a gallon of precious fluid filling her up. An orgasm flooded through her body, from deep inside her belly, out to her fingers and toes. Her nipples were so tender his grasp lit them up. It felt as though fireworks were going off in her head. 

 It was an unusual feeling to enjoy having her breasts fondled. They were usual off limits to Bernard. She lay there passively enjoying to afterglow of a wonderful orgasm. She shut out the awful day, and refused to think about how she was going to get through the next six days. 

 For a split second she sobered up, then passed out. 

 Roy cuddled her, with a delightful smile on his face. This was his first time, and he was deeply in love. He would look after her, and keep her safe. He rubbed his cheek against her back, and kissed her. He wanted to laugh out loud, and jump for joy, but kept still and quiet in case he woke her.

Janice becomes assertive, at last 

 Next morning Janice nursed a sore head. She was surprised to see Roy handing over a glass of orange juice, yet gratefully accepted it, and downed it in one. At least this time it was lacking vodka. He leaned forward and wrapped his arms around her. 

 'Good morning, darling,' he whispered in an ear. 

 After the initial surprise, she hissed, 'What are you doing in my bedroom? If my, err, uncle comes in he'll be cross, or worse.' 

 Peering over his shoulder she realised it wasn't her room. It then sank in he'd called her darling. She used that endearment while making love, or so her husband, Bernard, often told her. Pulling her thighs together, she felt something, and moaned in anguish. The crotch of her panties were askew, and very wet. She became aware of a familiar male musky smell. A mixture of her juices, and his, were leaking over her thighs. Her eyes went wide with fear. 

 'Oh! Shit!' she mumbled. 

 The boy was kissing her neck, working his way around to her lips. Her mouth hung open in astonishment. She lay back stunned, as he deeply kissed her. She didn't kiss him back, but he didn't seem to notice. He moved onto her little breasts, which were normally taboo, even to her husband. He kissed them reverently as though they were precious. 

 She lay there with a look of surprise on her face, or was it stupidity. How was she going to explain this to Bernard! Her mind froze, then went into a loop, emoting from recriminations, through guilt, to excuses, and back again. 

 She became aware that he was playing with her down there. She must put a stop to this! Letting a young guy of eighteen do things to her, a mature married woman, was so very wrong, very bad, and very stupid. She began to pant. Her mind caught up with her body, and at that moment her brain became flooded with arousal. 

 She shook her head to clear it of the muzzy feeling and regretted it. Reaching between her legs, she pulled his hand away. 

 'Not now, Roy, I'm not up to it,' she croaked. 

 'Had a good night then? Ready for breakfast? OH!' Emily exclaimed, and quietly shut the door on them. 

 She'd been worried over letting Janice down, by shoving her into Roy's bed. The girl was drunk, and he was a virgin, or had been last night. She didn't think they would get up to anything! Last night she was a little drunk herself and it seemed like a good joke, to see them waking up in bed together, looking highly embarrassed. Instead, they were awake early, and at it again. She'd guessed the girl wasn't a virgin, and knew what was what. It shouldn't have been a surprise to find they'd been at it, though it was still astonishing. 

 Eventually Janice emerged from the bedroom. She looked guilty as hell. Her brother looked so pleased with himself, he might burst. Emily had recovered, both from the alcohol, and finding them in a compromising position. 

 'So, what have you two been doing,' Emily cheerily said. 'Ready to go out for breakfast,?' she asked. 

 'I've got to get back to my room and change,' Janice shyly said. 

 It was so embarrassing facing Roy's sister, as the girl had discovered what they had been up to. She caught them fumbling around in bed this morning, and it was obvious Roy had made it with her last night. 

 'I can lend you some clothes, if you like,' Emily suggested. 

 Roy went back to the bedroom to find his watch, leaving the two girls to natter. 

 'I've got to get back to the room. I won't join you for breakfast, as it would be better to cool it off with Roy. He, I mean we, err, you know. We shouldn't have. I'd better go. Bernard will be wondering where I am,' she said, trying to sound firm. 

 Inside she was in turmoil, trying hard not to show it. 

 'I don't think your uncle will be missing you right now,' Emily grinned. 

 She knew her mother was in bed with him, as she hadn't arrived back to her room last night. She'd also heard the bed banging against the wall, while they were having it away. 

 'You're not going to drop my brother are you?' Emily questioned her. 

 'It was a mistake. I shouldn't have, can't get involved,' she gabled. 

 It didn't make it any easier sharing the awful truth with someone, as it was supposed to. Janice felt so guilty she wanted to cry. Only just holding back, she made her way to the door. 

 Emily moved quickly to block her way. 'You'll upset him, you know that. He's not that great with girls, and he's fallen for you. It's not just a one night stand for him,' Emily crossly pointed out. 

 'I'm sorry! I mustn't, it's wrong,' she whined. 

 'What will your uncle say, when he finds out. Oh, yes! I'll tell him, and mom,' Emily viciously warned. 

 'Please, you mustn't. He's my, err, guardian. He looks after me. Please don't tell Bernard, or your mother,' she pleaded. 

 The thought of that horrible woman putting her over a knee again for a spanking, was dreadful. Hearing Janice had been in bed with her precious son was likely to rile her. It would be more than a mere slap of her ass this time. The woman was too big and powerful to fight, and Sandra would have the support of Bernard. He would encourage the woman to punish her like a dirty, naughty girl. 

 Damn! She would think her son had been seduced by an older, married woman! Sandra would thrash her in public, to humiliate her! Janice's imagination was working overtime. The image of being punished by that brazen woman, while her husband encouraged the ordeal, was frightening. 

 'Stay with Roy. He won't pester you, much. All you have to do is keep him happy, and I'll keep your secret. OK?' Emily demanded an answer. 

 She changed her tone, softening to Janice. Maybe she wasn't such a slut after all. It wasn't her first time, as she would have reacted differently. It was just that she was more concerned over her uncle finding out, rather than thinking about how Roy felt. 

 'Come on, let's go to breakfast,' Emily said. 

 Janice pulled on the clothes her new friend gave her, not caring what she wore. Her mind was dominated by the stupidity of yesterday and last night. She was miserable, and unconcerned with anything around her, or what was being said. Her mind was dominated by guilt and worry over how Bernard was going to react. Would he see it in her face? Maybe it was better to avoid him for awhile. 

 Roy put his arm around her on the walk to a restaurant. There were several on the hotel complex, and they picked the one furthest from their rooms, with the intention of avoiding Bernard and the harridan. When she tried to pull away from Roy, Emily gave her a fierce look. Despite the implications, she found it comforting to be cuddled. Roy was nice, and wasn't trying to cajole her into anything. He was content just to be close. His sister had been heavy earlier, but she too turned out to be sympathetic. 

 As they entered the restaurant, Janice caught sight of herself in a mirror. She had been so self-obsessed, she hadn't noticed how she was dressed. The cut off t-shirt wasn't so bad, as there wasn't much to hide. 

 It was the shorts that made her look away. They were a tan colour, much the same as her legs. The stretchy shorts had ridden up in the crotch while walking there, showing a distinct camel toe. A sudden awareness of how lewdly her cheeks were separated, had a hand automatically ready to pull at them. The embarrassment of drawing attention to herself, stopped the movement. 

 She sat down at the nearest table. 

 'You go ahead, I'll order the coffee,' Janice said. 

 While they perused the buffet, she fiddled with the stretchy shorts. It was no good, they clung like a second skin. She looked down at herself, and groaned in dismay. If anything, they looked worse. The tiny shorts split her lips, revealing her private place. From a distance it would look as though she were naked. 

 With elbows on the table, she cradled her head in shame and self-pity. Emily brought her eggs, bacon, and waffles. 

 'Do you want honey, or corn syrup?' Emily asked. 

 'I don't think I could eat anything,' she shrugged. 

 'Come on eat. You'll never grow up if you don't,' Emily teased her. 

 Roy was tucking into a plate-full, and went back for more. 

 Janice picked at the food for a while, then bent to the inevitable. After all she had been through, the shorts were the least of her worries. She finished the breakfast and sipped another coffee. 

 Not caring how she looked, they left on a tour of the hotel complex. Roy and Emily showed her around, having arrived a couple of days earlier. There were the predictable reactions from men. They quickly looked away, when Roy and Emily glared at them. 

 The young guys showed interest, though Roy's presence kept the wolves at bay. After awhile she put her arm around him, in appreciation of his protection. She even managed to return a smile. How could she punish him for her mistakes. As the day wore on, they began to relax together, and she got him to talk. 

 Emily was pleased to see them getting on. It should have been before they got it off, but they looked good together, so that was all right. Her brother was happy and Janice was loosening up. She figured the magic potion was called for, to end another perfect day. She'd filled a bottle with orange, and a good dose of her mother's vodka. 

 Hand in hand, they meet up with Bernard and Sandra. 

 'Where have you three been all day?' Sandra asked. Not sounding displeased over them being missing, one little bit. 

 'Just around. Showing Janice around,' Emily spoke up. 

 'Good. You've looked after her then,' Sandra said, and pinched Janice's cheek. 

 Janice wanted to ask what they had been up to all day. She bit her tongue, holding back a caustic remark. What did it matter if her husband had spent the day with that woman, when she had spent the night with Roy. She just wanted to get away from both of them. So did the other two. 

 'Here's some pocket money,' Sandra offered her two. 'Here you are, dear, something for you too. Don't spend it all on sweets,' she warned Janice. 

 Bernard wanted to say something, though what could he say. He wasn't used to dealing with children, and it was all the more confusing that his niece, was really his wife. It was a mystery to him why she was still behaving like this. Why hadn't she come back to their room to change into something decent? 

 On second thoughts, that would have been a disaster. He'd been in bed with Sandra, until almost midday. Maybe that was why she was avoiding him. At least she wasn't looking at him with daggers in her eyes, as would be expected if she knew. 

 'Let me, I should, err. Here's some pocket money,' he awkwardly spoke. 

 It felt strange treating his wife like a teenager. Giving her pocket money at least saved him spending on a shopping spree. Not that he would allow her to waste money. 

 'Don't hold it in your hand, you'll lose it. Tuck it away in a pocket,' Sandra told Janice. 

 Janice didn't have a pocket, so tucked the notes in the tight waist band. It was then that Bernard noticed what she was wearing. 

 Taking her to one side, he demanded, 'Have you been walking around like that all day?' 

 'Yes! No thanks to you. Emily wouldn't let me go back to our room this morning, until well after breakfast. When we did, you weren't there. I still haven't got a key,' she hissed at him. 

 'Oh! Well. What are you going to do about this farce?' he asked. 

 He was relieved she hadn't found out about his indiscretion. He and Sandra had been drunk, when they tumbled into his room, and on to the bed. She was certainly less inhibited than his wife. He'd never had such a steamy session. 

 'I don't know. I can't declare I'm your wife now. We would be a laughing stock all through the hotel,' Janice whispered back. 

 She was thinking over what Emily told her, about telling everyone she had slept with Roy. She didn't want her husband finding out, or anyone else finding out she was a married woman. It meant playing along with the ruse, until they thought of something. 

 'That must be avoided, of course. We had better carry on as we are. Just don't mess up, OK?' he firmly stated. 

 'Go on you three, scamper off and play,' Sandra encouraged them. 

 His wife seemed eager to be away with the two kids. He watched her walk off, hip to hip, with that boy's arm embracing her. In the poor light it looked as though her bottom half was naked. He could see her cheeks gyrate as she walked away. 

 Caught between demanding her return, and being free to spend time with Sandra, he hesitated. How could he let his wife walk away looking like that, with a boy holding on to her? He was clinging to her tighter than the shorts. He opened his mouth to shout at her, to call her back. 

 The words froze in his mouth on seeing the boy grope his wife. The boy dropped his hand to Janice's bottom and palmed a cheek. She didn't even miss a step as they walked away. The boy ran his fingers between her cheeks! 

 Sandra wrapped an arm around him, and kissed his lips. He couldn't say anything, from fear his wife might turn and catch them smooching. Over Sandra's shoulder he could see his wife trying to untangle herself from that boy. Roy had Janice's bottom in both his hands, and was kissing her neck. Damn! His wife seemed to have given up the struggle to get away from him. 

 'They seem to be getting on fine. It will leave us time to play,' Sandra giggled, and grabbed his cock through his trousers. 

 Damn! She was so much more exciting than Janice. It also made a change to have a large pair of breasts in bed. 

 'We shouldn't let them get too close,' Bernard warned. 

 He strained his eyes in their direction, but couldn't see them in the dark. 

 'Is she on the pill?' Sandra asked, without the usual amusement tinting her voice. 

 'Yes. Oh! They can't, err, not my, err, niece,' he spluttered. 

 'It might calm them both down. They need to learn about life, Bernard. They're at that awkward age. I guess I've got to let him grow up,' she mused. 

 'You can't mean it. Not with my, err, niece, not your son, with my. . .' he said, looking shaken. 

 'Well, I'm sure she can look after herself. If she doesn't want to, she won't,' Sandra said. 

 Bernard couldn't believe they were talking about Janice like that. Shit! The woman wanted her son to screw his wife! Sandra wanted his wife to be used as a sexual plaything, to teach the boy about sex. Not that she was very imaginative in bed. He dismissed the uncalled-for thought. Janice had already been put upon by those two, letting them drag her around all day. She was too easily influenced, unable to make her own decisions. 

 'We had better see what they are up to,' Bernard urgently said. 

 He grabbed Sandra's hand, and followed them. 

 Janice gave in to others far too much. Without him around to tell her what to do, there was no telling what she might be talked into. The makeover, and the disaster yesterday was a result of giving in to two young girls. It looked as though Roy and his sister were influencing Janice, and leading her into deeper trouble. 

 Anything could happen, if he left her in the hands of a randy eighteen year old. Hell! Watching her reluctantly giving in to that boy, letting him kiss her, then maul her, was shocking. Left with that boy long enough, and she would be putty in his hands. It was dreadful to think she might give in to him. 

 'Slow down! I thought we might go back to your room for a drink,' she complained. 

 The path led to the open air arena. He could see Janice and the other two sitting on the steps at the front of the arena. There was no way he could drag Sandra down there, through the crowd. For a moment he considered leaving Sandra, to barge his way through the throng. Other kids were sitting around, watching some group playing what they called music, and what he called - too loud. Instead he and Sandra took a table overlooking the three kids, thinking they couldn't get up to much down there. 

 Janice should have been furious with her husband, for not helping her out of the dire situation. Feeling guilty prevented her from thinking to demand the room key, as she just wanted to get away from him. 

 Spending the day with Roy and Emily had been fun, and relaxing, with the pressures of adult responsibility shaken off for a short time. Roy was attentively looking after her, which was comforting. It was also necessary to keep him happy, to prevent Emily from revealing her awful secret. 

 Emily handed Janice a plastic cup of juice. Janice smelt it, confirming it was vodka and orange. This time she sipped it, rather than knock it back. The loud music and alcohol had its effect on an already troubled mind. Roy pulled her into his shoulder, which she readily accepted. 

 He whispered in her ear and she nodded, not knowing what she was agreeing to. She was mellow, and no longer keeping Roy happy just to keep his sister quiet. He kissed an ear on his way around her neck, and she joined in. 

 Bernard wasn't happy. Sandra's boy and his wife were sitting hand in hand, hip to hip, like young lovers. Now they were necking! 

 'You OK?' Sandra asked, having to speak close into his ear. 

 'Are you sure they should be doing that?' he asked. 

 He hoped she would say something, to give him an excuse to break them up. 

 'I know what you mean. It's difficult, but you've got to give them room to experiment,' Sandra said. 

 Sandra wouldn't be so understanding if she knew her son was experimenting with his wife. He gulped a cocktail and ordered another. He looked down at them and was shocked. The young guy had his arms around his wife, deeply kissing her. Damn! The boys hands were all over his wife. She must know he was watching, so this was in retaliation for leaving her with the kids. What she would do on discovering he was bedding Roy's mother, he dare not think about. 

 She wasn't encouraging the lad, but she wasn't fighting him off either. 

 'I should send her to her room,' he said. 

 'Best keep an eye on them here. There's no telling what they'll get up to in her room,' Sandra pointed out. 'Besides, we could use your room again, if you like,' Sandra laughed. 

 Recalling last night's romp, he grinned back at her. 

 He couldn't help looking at his wife, noting their progress. She looked so hot, it seemed she was enjoying it. Was it just a silly mistake, letting that boy work her up into a state of arousal, or was she doing it on purpose. She wasn't very good at saying no. She was too easily talked into doing what others wanted, which in this case was dangerous. He knew full well what a young randy guy wanted. 

 'Don't worry. A girl has her limits, and won't go beyond them,' Sandra reassured him. 

 He wasn't so sure. She wasn't a girl, she was a woman of experience. Surely his wife wasn't going to let that young guy screw her, to get back at him? Where was that boy's hand? Damn! She was letting him maul her breasts! What was she doing to him? Their hands were everywhere. 

 She was enthusiastically smooching him now, not just letting him kiss her. He couldn't see the boys hands, and that worried him. What was she doing now? Shit! Her hips were moving in a slow steady rhythm. Was his hand in the crotch of those flimsy shorts? 

 He looked down at his own crotch, and gulped. Sandra had a hand in his jeans, pulling on his cock. He was hard as a rock. It was enough of a distraction to pull his eyes away from Janice. What the hell! He'd already had Sandra, and was going to again. They quickly paid the bill and were ready to leave. 

 A glance back at his wife relieved any guilt that might have remained. She was carried away in a passionate embrace, with that boy! She was behaving more lewdly in public than she would ever have done with him. It was well beyond a reprisal for his abandonment of her. It was her fault she was trapped in the role of adolescent, so she would have to un-entangle herself without his help.  

 

 

===

Bernard and Sandra had speedily reached the room, torn their clothes off, and were writhing on the bed. Bernard was amazed at the way she freely sucked his cock into her mouth, and swallowed it. He only just held back from spurting his load into her belly. 

 She came up for air, and smiled at him. 'I know you want to. I'll revive you for my turn if you do,' she said, with a look of devilment in her eyes. 

 Oh fuck! She was inviting him to spurt his load down her throat! 

 'No. Let me suck your breasts,' he heavily breathed at her. 

 She slowly kissed her way up his body, and all the while he watched, his cock stiffened harder. She meant it. She was willing to suck him back to life, to do it again. He wanted her on top so he could suck on her breasts, while she rode him. 

 At the last moment she sat up, pulling her breasts away from his open mouth. She lowered herself onto his cock, pushing hard to gain it all. She leant forward with her breasts an inch from his mouth, and teased him. He tried to push up, with them so close, but again they were just out of reach. The movement sawed his cock over her clit, and she moaned in pleasure. 

 Damn! The woman was magical. He gave up on her breasts to heave her up, feeling his cock deep inside. She gripped it fiercely, and began to slowly ride him. He lay back watching her large tits swaying tantalisingly above him. He started to cum, and she followed. 

 The four of them made it back to their rooms, with numerous petting stops on the way. As though taking the lead from Emily, she followed Roy into his bedroom, as Emily led her new boyfriend to hers. 

 Not so drunk this time, Janice didn't have that excuse to misbehave. She'd spent the whole day with a handsome young guy, noticing other girls admiring him, and staring at her with jealous looks. She was no longer the girl in high school left out. She was with the handsome hunk, and was ready to surrender to him. Sitting on his bed, necking, she felt his hand on her chest. She was about to back away, from realising she was going too far. 

 The sound of Emily and the boy in the next room, made her hesitate. An obvious banging on the wall of a bed-head, added to the sense that everyone else was enjoying themselves. It was just a holiday romance, she murmured around his tongue. 

 She fell back, pulled her top off and rolled down the shorts. He reverently sucked on a nipple, while she watched in amazement. He appreciated her little breasts! A hand was gently stroking the other breast. They tingled as they had never done before. She arched her back, wanting to feel him down there. As though he had got the message, he kissed his way down her body, lingering tantalisingly over her flat tummy, then onward. 

 He kissed her mound, her thighs, and everything between. There was no turning back now. She was well and truly hooked. She pulled him onto her, and manoeuvred her hips under him. She took hold of his stiffness, and guided it across her bud, back and forth. There was no need, for she was soaking wet, it was just a self indulgence. 

 'Darling, fill me up. Fill me with your lovely cock,' she implored him. 

 He thrust into her deep and hard. She hadn't experienced such wild abandon before. Their hips hit each other, pounding away at a fast pace. He suddenly stopped, pushing deep with strong leg muscles. She could feel his cock pulsing, imagining his red hot sperm driving deep into her body. Her belly erupted, with flames flowing along her veins, vitalising her entire body. 

 'Darling, fill me with our lovely cum. I'm cumin, I'm there, hold still,' she whimpered. 

 They kissed and cuddled for awhile, then she turned over with him spooning her. In a warm embrace they felt replete, and at one with each other. They soon fell into a deep happy sleep. 

 *** 

 Next morning Janice lay awake, wondering how this had happened. It was obvious her husband was having an affair with that woman. She couldn't blame Sandra, for she had pretended to be his niece, and hadn't been strong enough to stop their flirting. It would be easy to blame herself for everything, though surely Bernard had to share it. 

 With time to think, she remembered the bed-head banging against the wall, and worked out it was coming from her room. While her husband was banging Sandra, the son was banging her. 

 She held his face to her breast, and happily stroked his hair. It was because he treasured her breasts, and treated them with respect, that she allowed him to see and touch them so freely. It was a refreshing change to be so relaxed with her body, in front of someone. She was falling in love with him, yet didn't have the right to. She was a married woman, and he was just starting out in life, needing to find himself a young lover. 

 It was her turn to fetch him a glass of orange. It was a duty she felt glad to carry out, for her paramour. 

 The freckles were still plainly visible, though the hair dye was thankfully fading. As soon as she could get into her room, she would have to grab the spare contact lenses. In the meantime the geeky glasses would have to be put up with. None of her clothes were suitable for a teenager, so she would have to borrow some from Emily. Her panties were flimsy things, but might do, and she no longer felt the need for a padded bra. Not in the company of Roy and his sister. 

 Janice put a hand to her mouth in surprise. The way she was planning things, it seemed she'd made up her mind to continue with the ruse. Was it to get back at her husband, or because she was sweet on Roy? Maybe, yet again, she was just conforming to what everyone else wanted. 

 'You look pleased with yourself this morning,' Emily accused Janice. 

 It was meant playfully and Janice gave her a big smile in return. 

 'What about you two, then?' Janice teased. 

 'He was all right. I kicked him out around three. You two were on your second session then,' she loftily said, with a grin on her face. 

 'Oh, I didn't. . . we did, didn't we!' Janice said in surprise. 

 She didn't have much experience, but with Roy she felt it her duty to teach him. A silly idea, but she was becoming more free in bed. It was a good thing, if her pleasure levels were anything to go by. 

 'Come on, let's go to breakfast,' Emily encouraged, when Roy appeared. 

 Janice patted down the t-shirt, borrowed from Emily. A few days ago, she would have been worried about it being too short, when worn as a dress. They were her sandals, yet everything else was borrowed. Everything else didn't mean much, just a t-shirt, and a pair of teeny panties, from the lost property box. 

 With Roy holding her tight, and Emily lightening their mood, she didn't care. On the way to the restaurant, Roy gently caressed her bottom, and she rested her head on his shoulder. People walking by didn't notice them, or if they did, they smiled pleasantly. Maybe they were remembering the innocence of their own youth. 

 Janice was reliving her youth, though this wasn't something she'd ever experienced. Maybe this was a second chance to be infatuated with a handsome young man. 

 She knew her thoughts were coming up with excuses to make this acceptable. She was being carried away on a silly holiday romance, and should put a stop to it. Using Emily's blackmail threat as an excuse was another way of avoiding the honest truth. 

 What the hell! She was on vacation, and could enjoy it as much as her husband was doing. Now she thought of him, it was realised she felt happier away from him. Coming into contact with him made her feel guilty, but before all this, he made her feel anxious all the time. 

 The waiter quickly turned up, working hard for a tip. 'What's your pleasure this morning, ladies, gentleman?' the waiter politely asked. 

 They ordered, and off he went with a notepad full of scribbles. 

 'This is a change from the other day. You remember lunch with my mom?' Emily asked. 

 'How could I forget that harridan. Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean,' Janice wound down to a stop. 

 'Don't worry, mom put you through it bad,' Emily sympathised. 

 'I should of helped you out,' Roy added. 

 'It all worked out OK in the end,' Janice said, with a shrug. 

 Roy leaned over and tenderly kissed her. Janice glowed warmly. 

 'So it did end up OK,' Emily laughed at the two of them. 

 Janice had never been so open and demonstrative in public. Not having to dress up, and act like an adult to preserve her dignity, meant she could relax. No longer having to fight to maintain her adult status left her feeling free. No one took any notice of teenagers behaving badly, it was expected. In any case, they were just doing what came naturally. All the things she had missed out on in her teenage years. 

 Janice leaned over to Roy and kissed him passionately. She left a hand in his lap, resting on his growing hardness. The naughtiness of it thrilled her. Shedding the responsibilities of age, had allowed her to shed the restricting behaviour of adulthood. Maybe she was head over heels in love, for the first time. 

 After breakfast they hung around together. They met up with Harold, the guy Emily met. Emily linked arms with Janice to gossip about the two guys, and things in general. Janice had felt isolated in college, and so this too was a first. She found Emily refreshingly honest, and couldn't help laughing at her frank description of how useless guys were in bed. 

 'Roy is considerate. He tries to please me,' Janice explained. 

 'Harold doesn't. He's a wham, bam, thank you ma'am. He rolled off me last night, got dressed, and went,' Emily complained. 

 'That's terrible. Why are you still with him after that?' Janice said, sounding offended for her friend. 

 'Well, it was after the second time,' she giggled. 'He's got a big dick, and I'll teach him what to do with it,' she laughed. 

 Janice was a little shocked, but joined in, happy to be sharing intimacies with a new friend. 

 The two guys grunted at each other, with little to say. 

 They turned a corner onto the beach where a breeze caught Janice's baggy t- shirt. It was up under her shoulders before she could bring it under control. Emily didn't make a fuss over it, and just stood back watching her friends frantic fight. 

 'You worry too much. Tonight we're going skinny dipping with the guys,' Emily told her. She held up a hand, indicating there was to be no argument. 

 Without thinking about it much, Emily guided them away from the beach, to where she thought her mother could be found. They were usually at a cafe bar, snacking and drinking. 

 'Wowwww!' the two girls wailed. 

 Sprinklers suddenly burst out, drenching them. The guys laughed, only just avoiding a soaking. They ran from the jets, which were click clacking around in a circle. 

 Janice immediately checked herself out, and desperately covered her breasts. 

 'Don't do that,' Emily scolded her. 'You've a great figure, there's no need to be afraid of it,' she rebuked her friend. 

 'I'm not afraid. It's just that, well, I've always wanted. . .' she trailed off. 

 'Bigger boobs. Loads of women want bigger tits. The secret is not to let it bother you. Whatever you've got, be proud of it,' Emily heavily lectured. 'You've got more than a cat-walk model,' she pointed out. 

 She pulled Janice's hands away from her chest, and smiled. 

 'You happy with Janice's tits?' she asked her brother. 

 'They're lovely. Wonderfully sensitive,' he grinned. 

 'Yea, her tits are OK. I don't like big saggy ones,' the boyfriend added. 

 The girls looked at each other and chuckled. 

 'OK. I believe you,' Janice granted. 

 It was still difficult holding back from covering them. The wet t-shirt exposed them to all and sundry. She kept telling herself she was just a teen, so it didn't matter. Teenagers showed themselves off for fun, and didn't care. 

 'You three having fun? I see you've found a new friend, Emily, that's nice. Don't forget to take your pill,' Sandra told her daughter. 

 Emily rolled her eyes in mock despair, at her mother's embarrassing remark, in front of the new boyfriend. At least mom was relaxed about everything, now she was getting what she wanted from Bernard. She became irritable and broody when not having sex regularly. 

 'Have you tidied your room?' Sandra asked. 

 'Like yes, ma'am,' Janice said, following Roy and Emily's lead. 

 'You can have some pocket money then,' Sandra condescendingly spoke. 

 'Thank you, uncle,' Janice demurely said. 

 He knew something was going on between his wife and Roy, but that left him free to screw Sandra. Instead of facing up to the truth, he blanked it out. His wife was acting like one of the kids, so it was easy to just carry on pretending. Besides, it would be highly embarrassing to stop now, and admit she was his wife. He could imagine the fuss Sandra would make over his wife sleeping with her son. Everyone in the hotel would soon know every sordid detail. 

 Bernard gave his wife some pocket money, which he was pleased to do, as it was saving him money. If she had been spending as a wife, it would have meant a new outfit, and jewellery. Not that he allowed her to be extravagant with his hard earned cash. 

 'You can run along and play with your friends. Make sure you're a good girl,' he said, rubbing in her new role. 

 'Thank you, ma'am, thank you, sir,' Janice respectfully said. 

 Sandra took hold of her hand, and quietly spoke to her. 'Have you been taking your pill, dear. You need to be careful. I don't want any accidents.' 

 'Err, yea, sure, ma'am,' Janice answered. 

 She was lying, and felt stupid for missing a few days. She was behaving like an irresponsible adolescent, but this was simply brainless. Fuck! If she became pregnant with that young boy, what would happen then? A powerful instinctive feeling had her reeling. Her mind inexplicably switched on deep maternal instincts. This might be her last chance to have a baby, as Bernard wasn't interested. 

 She'd let the adolescent role take over too deeply. She couldn't be so irresponsible as to become pregnant by a young boy. She shook her head, of the terrible thought. Instead of running from him in fear, she let him take her hand. She kissed him, long and hard, not thinking about her husband being there. The four of them sauntered off, hand in hand. 

 Bernard watched his wife smooching the boy, as though they were young lovers. Anger and consternation vied with each other. What could he say in front of everyone. He could hardly demand that his lover's son, must bring his wife back. The ridiculousness of his position left the consternation winning over anger. 

 'It's all right Bernard. You're niece can look after herself. It's just a vacation infatuation. She'll forget all about him once home. It's nice to see the young things in love. They're playing around, learning about things, but we know, don't we,' Sandra said, with a mischievous grin on her face. 

 'It's the learning about things I'm worried about,' he remarked. 

 'We could go back to your room, and I'll give you an all over massage. That will calm you down,' she suggested. 

 'Calm me down, or excite me?' he laughed. 

 She grabbed the front of his trousers, and told him, 'Excited already by the feel of things,' she commented. 

 More loud music that evening, combined with vodka, meant that Janice and Roy ended up in bed. Janice had thrown off the shackles of adult responsibilities, to do what came natural. Sex had never been natural to her, or as exciting as it was with Roy. Without prompting she got undressed, and snuggled up to him. 

 She even guided his mouth to a nipple, having lost her fear of revealing her small breasts. At least with him. Taking the advice from Emily, she guided him down the bed toward her naughty bits. A moment of inspiration had her turning around, to try something. In a sixty-nine position she hesitated over his penis, while he took the lead. 

 Roy had never had a close up look at a woman's sex. Of course he had a rough idea as to what was there, but it looked so much more complicated compared to pictures. He licked her slit, and after awhile found her button. He sucked it, and heard her moaning, confirming he was doing the right thing. 

 Janice hesitated kissing his penis. Bernard had suggested it once or twice, but given up on encouraging her. For Roy she was willing to try it. Her new liberated self was willing to try a lot of new things. She held his penis, but was a little frightened of it. She told herself she was just waiting to see if he needed instructions down there. 

 'Oh! Yes! Mmmm,' she moaned. 

 There was no excuse, she had to take the plunge. It didn't taste very nice. She licked it, and dribbled out of the corner of her mouth. He would be sleeping on that wet patch. She took a deep breath, then sucked its head into her mouth. The feel of it wasn't too bad, and if he enjoyed the sensation, it would have been worth the sacrifice. 

 'Oh! Yes, do that,' she groaned. 

 Feeling his tongue enter her vagina was arousing. So much so, she sucked strongly on his cock, to treat it like a valued friend. This wonderful cock would be pleasuring her soon. She thanked it for the wonderful orgasms it had given her over the past few days. She pulled as much of his cock into her mouth as possible, and caressed his balls in one hand. 

 Every time he sucked her nub, she powerfully sucked his cock. He was managing to suck all her bits into his mouth, so she felt obliged to do the same. She tried, and failed. It bulged her cheek, but was too long to fit in her mouth. Could she swallow it? Could she swallow his cum? 

 She lay there contentedly suckling on his cock, enthralled with it, intensely enjoying the attention to her sex. Feeling him play with her asshole, she made more of an effort with his sack. It had hardened like a large walnut. Her earnest efforts persuaded his cock into becoming even harder, and bigger. 

 For some while they kept up a steady licking, sucking, biting, and fondling synchronisation. Their bodies cried out for relief, and a conclusion to the sexual tension. 

 'I'm gonna cum!' he warned. 

 'Me too!' she wailed. 

 The imminent deliverance of relief, overawed the doubt as to whether she could accept his cum in her mouth. She sucked on his cock with an extra pull, and swallowed in gulps. Each spurt she quickly swallowed, not wanting to feel the sticky globs in her mouth. 

 Roy's cock pulsed in time with the powerful pulls on his cock. She was gripping it tight, sucking him dry. Her hand was pumping his balls of every last drop. He continued to thrust his tongue as deeply as possible into her body. A finger joined in, with a thumb rubbing her clit. She was thrusting her crotch in his face, as though trying to suffocate him. 

 Their animal like gasps and grunts, carried on for awhile. After what seemed an age, their heads collapsed into each other's laps. Their bodies sank into the bed, replete, exhausted. It felt as though the body had been sucked dry. Neither had an orgasm last so long. It felt as though they had achieved something marvellous, for each other, as well as themselves. It was inspirational, almost a religious experience. 

 How could she hold back from anything he wanted after that! He had similar thoughts, wondering what they could try next, and would it be as gratifying as this. 

 *** 

 Roy and Emily were on a two week vacation, whereas Janice only had the one week. That week went far too quickly. The three of them made promises to keep in touch, swapping telephone numbers, and email addresses. Outside the hotel the bus had been loaded, and Emily walked away from them, to give them a last moment alone. 

 Janice could see her husband in a deep conversation with the woman. Roy was murmuring sweetness to her. His arms held on tight, not wanting to let her go. She felt his hardness against her belly, and a wicked thought crossed her mind. 

 

  

 

 

===

'Step back, in there,' she urgently breathed into his ear. Through the thin screen of bushes, she could see her husband, but didn't care. She hoisted the front of the t-shirt dress, and pulled her panties to one side. 

 'We've not done it outside today,' she said, with a naughty grin. 

 He didn't need encouraging. He lifted her up, and lowered her onto his cock. He pushed up at her with urgent thrusts from powerful leg muscles. 

 Over his shoulder she could see her husband looking around for her. If he looked carefully, he and anyone else, would see them at it. It wasn't as comfortable or pleasurable as being in bed. Nevertheless, there was an extra excitement from the danger of being discovered. 

 Feeling him spurt his load, she too cum. Just a warm feeling, nothing exciting enough to scream about. It was their last chance, and nice under the circumstances. It was certainly different, and showed how brazen she had become. The warm glow continued spreading throughout her body, and reached her face. She couldn't wipe the smile of satisfaction off her face. 

 'Another few days, and we'll be back home,' Sandra was saying. 

 'Ah, there you are. The bags are on the bus. Say good bye to Sandra. I guess you've said farewell to Roy and his sister,' he crossly spoke. 

 'Thank you, ma'am for making the holiday so good,' Janice said. 

 She meant it, though aiming it toward Roy and Emily. She suffered the woman hugging her, and the suffocation of her deep cleavage. Emily was next for a cheerful hug. 

 'Wipe your thighs, you dirty bitch,' Emily whispered. 

 She handed her friend a tissue, half expecting her to clean herself up right there in front of everyone. The shy young girl they first met, turned out to be a right party animal. She had even got Roy to have sex in the bushes, where anyone could have seen them. 

 They laughed together, trying not to cry, and only just succeeding. Then it was Roy's turn. They hugged and kissed. It looked as though a bucket of cold water would be needed to separate them. 

 'Come on! The bus is ready,' Bernard demanded. 

 Janice let go of lover boy, and a strange, yet wonderful vacation. 

 He glowered at his wife for wearing such flimsy attire. The t-shirt hardly covered her thighs, and her nipples were hard, showing through the cotton. When she sat down he was about to tell her to rub in the sun tan lotion. A whiff of something familiar told him what it was. He looked away, shocked to realise that boy's cum was running over his wife's thighs. 

 He was too stunned to cope with the situation, and so ignored her and what happened. The flight home was spent in silent contemplation. He thought about Sandra, and she contemplated how relaxing it had been without Bernard. 

 *** 

 When they got home, Bernard went away on a business trip, then a training course. Janice joined an assertiveness class, as something to do while he was away. When he was home, they hardly talked. They avoided talking about their vacation romances, though it sat heavily between them. 

 *** 

 Janice continued with her assertive classes, not really thinking they were much good. At the end of the session they were to pair off to think of a scenario for next week, where they would have to assert themselves. 

 One of the women warned her about the man who was there to prey on insecure women. He strode toward her, and she sighed heavily. 

 'Let's get out of here and come up with something. My apartments near here, so we can have a drink and discuss next week's session,' he said. 

 'I don't think so. I've got to go,' she shyly spoke. 

 'I insist,' he said, and took a firm grip of her wrist. 

 He walked her toward the door, talking firmly to her, insisting she complied with his demand. 

 'I haven't got time,' she timidly said, only to be ignored. 

 She thought of Emily and Roy, especially of Roy. The last moment with him came to mind. She remembered lifting the dress, offering herself to him. 

 The obnoxious man let go of her wrist, and staggered back. 

 It was then she realised her free hand had lifted the dress. 'I told you I haven't got time. Either it's here, or I'm going,' she brazenly spoke. 

 Everyone was staring at them. He stammered incoherently. She dropped the dress, and stalked out. Back at the car she shook with nervous laughter. Maybe the group was having an effect upon her after all. Not long ago she would have died of shame. Maybe it was just easier to expose her panties, after those terrible vacation moments. 

 *** 

 Without a word of explanation over where he'd been, Bernard came home Monday evening. Janice had a peaceful weekend while he was away, and wasn't pleased to see him. She wasn't sure what she wanted, or was going to do, but the idea was forming that it didn't include him. He was on edge, waiting for her to say something. She handed him a coffee, without saying a word. 

 'I'm moving in. . . with Sandra,' he blurted out. 

 'What am I going to do?' she plaintively responded. 

 The pathetic sound of her voice was a surprise. Wasn't this what she wanted? 

 'She has a big house, so you could move in with us for awhile. Until you get a job, and sort things out,' he offered. 

 'What? Why?' Janice lamely asked. 

 She was stunned that he could suggest such a stupid idea. 

 'The money from the sale of this house would give us a new start,' he pointed out. 

 'How can you think that could possibly work,' she said. 

 'You'd have your own room,' said Bernard. 

 'Does Sandra know your planning on bringing your wife along to your love nest?' she asked, with a touch of incredulity in her voice. 'That would be cosy.' 

 'Well, I figured you could play along for a little longer. You know, pretend to be my niece,' he suggested. 

 Either he'd gone mad, or she was missing something. Why on earth would she want to move in with her husband, and his lover. He wasn't very good at compromising, and wanted to get his own way all the time, hence this stupid idea. Knowing him, he had a selfish reason. 

 'Are you having a hard time with the kids?' she asked. 

 'With Roy, mostly. If you were there you might be able to sort him out. Keep him out of the way,' he said, and shrugged. 

 'Like babysitting? So you think an eighteen year old will go for that?' she asked, sounding sceptical. 

 'You got on well with him on vacation,' he grumbled. 

 Guilty feelings shouldn't affect her, as he had slept with that damn woman, Sandra. Despite sleeping with Roy, the situation didn't balance out, or assuage the guilt she felt. 

 'You can't be serious!' she nervously laughed. 

 'You don't have to do anything, just play along, keeping him happy,' he said. 

 'How will that possibly work, Bernard. You want your wife to flirt with that boy, while you screw his mother?' she complained. 

 'It's not like that, you're just being negative,' he said. 

 'I'd be living in your lover's house, pretending to be an adolescent, without the consideration and respect an adult deserves. I'd be treated like one of the kids, living under her rules. If I don't do as I'm told, what then? You remember the humiliation in that restaurant, don't you?' she reminded him. 

 She shook her head, wondering what in hell he was thinking. He was up to something, as usual, and she needed to find out what. 

 'It wouldn't be like that. I know it would be awkward. Living there for nothing would help you out. You could go to college on a refresher course in accountancy, or whatever. I'll give you some money each week, to tide you over. Once the house is sold you can find your own place,' he said, trying to enthuse her. 

 He just couldn't see it, or rather, he didn't want to. It had been the same from the moment they were married. He'd worn her down until she submitted to what he wanted in every little thing. It happened so slowly she hadn't noticed, until he'd taken over her life. Trying a different tack, she decided to agree with him, until finding out what it was really all about. 

 'I guess it would help me out for a while,' she mused. 'As one of the kids, it would look alright if you gave me an allowance,' she quietly said. 

 'Sure, why not. You'll need money, while you're on a training course. If you try I'm sure it would work, just for a little while,' he said. 

 He gave her a reassuring smile, knowing he was swinging her into line as usual. 

 'If I'm going back to school, what about clothes, books, and other stuff?' she asked. 

 'Yea, yea, sure, whatever you need,' he confirmed. 'I'll even buy you a schoolgirl uniform,' he laughed. 

 She giggled, and said, 'That would be naughty, having your wife dressed as a schoolgirl, while you sleep with your girlfriend. Would you be able to cope, having your wife and lover in the same house?' she teased. 

 He felt as if she were slipping from his grasp. Since returning from vacation she had been more rebellious, less conforming. She was his wife, and should do as she was told. 

 She put her head on one side, giving him an innocent look. She was determined to allay his suspicions that she was just leading him on. 

 'There's a good college in that area, so it's tempting. I'm not sure about it, Bernard. Are you sure we could make it work?' she asked. 

 'Sure, we can. You look so young when you dress that way. I'll pay the school fees and everything else, while you're there. You did a good convincing job on vacation,' he assured her. 

 Then it dawned on her. With him money was more important than anything else. Yet he was offering to pay her an allowance, and college fees. He mentioned selling the house, and was expecting half the property value. 

 She put on a look of innocence and vulnerability . 

 'I'd need you to look after me, Bernard. You know I rely on you. Though you'd have to be careful not to rouse suspicion, so they don't find out I'm your wife. After all, what would I do without you, if she kicked me out?' she said, with a pathetic expression. 

 'Sure, don't worry. I'll be there to look after you, like I've always done. We can make it work. You just have to do as you're told,' he said, giving her a false caring smile. 

 'Are you sure Bernard? You're asking your wife to live in another woman's house, while you sleep with her. Would you mind that? I guess I need you to tell me what to do, as always,' she pathetically stated. 

 'No problem at all. Well, I guess it would be a little awkward,' he conceded. 

 'Once I move in we'd have to carry it through. You'd have to support Sandra, and not make me your favourite kid,' she said. 

 'I'll still keep an eye on you, and make sure you're alright,' he smiled. 

 'Thank you Bernard. Though I'd better start calling you sir. As an adolescent it would look right when you to tell me what to do, just as you do now. As an eighteen year old, I'd have to go to high school, rather than college,' she said. 

 'I guess you're right. That would be awkward,' he said, looking worried. 

 'You're right about the school uniform. They wear one in the school local to Sandra's house. Do you think I could fit in, going back to high school?' she asked. 

 'I'm sure you could, if you put your mind to it. You look young enough when dressed like a teenager. I'm sure you'd soon fit in, and would get back into the swing of things,' he assured her. 

 'I guess it would all come back to me, after all, it isn't that long ago. I'd have to do my homework, make new friends, go to movies, and all the things adolescents do,' she reminisced. 

 'Sounds like fun,' he laughed. 

 'It might be awkward at home though. I'll have to be careful, and do as I'm told, and abide by Sandra's rules in the house. I'd have to behave like a good girl all the time. Do you think I could do that, sir?' she asked. 

 'I'm glad you're thinking it through. We can make it work, I'm sure,' he encouraged. 

 'What if Roy complains about me to his mother, or I accidently break the rules? She would punish me, or send me to my room, or ground me. Maybe she'd put me over her knee for a spanking again, like in that restaurant. You'd have to back her up, not to get on the wrong side of her, and Roy,' she worriedly spoke. 

 For a moment she thought over the humiliating moments while on vacation, when her nakedness had been exposed in public. It was something she would never forget. As the naughty episode, became less tangible with time, she was left with something unexpected. Surprisingly, she felt excited, and slightly aroused every time she recalled it. 

 'It won't come to that. I'll make sure,' he confidently told her. 

 'I guess it's only fair to keep Roy out of your way, in return for an allowance. I'm a bit worried about that. He's a randy eighteen year old, and will probably make demands upon me. He would expect a lot, after what happened on vacation. Would you mind if he took advantage of me?' 

 'That's up to you, of course,' he hesitantly spoke. 

 'He has a way of working me up. He's difficult to resist,' she said. 

 She recalled their time together on vacation, and yet again felt moist. Her eyes were a little wet, as well as down there. 

 'I noticed. We don't have to dwell on that. What else is there?' he asked, sounding huffy. 

 'What am I supposed to do? I can hardly bring home a guy my age, from a club or something. What would Sandra say to that? I'd be grounded for a month,' Janice pouted. 

 'No, that wouldn't work,' he gruffly acknowledged. 

 'If I brought home someone from school, then Roy would go into a sulk. Both him and his mother would give you a hard time. Sir, you'll have to tell me what to do, like you always have,' she said. 

 'I don't know. I guess you're right. It's more difficult than I thought,' he murmured. 'I guess we'll have to go carefully,' he solemnly advised. 'I'll have to keep an eye on you, and you'll have to do as I say,' he concluded. 

 There wasn't the slightest thought for what she wanted. Just as long as he got what he wanted, that boy could fuck her for all he cared. How could he expect his wife to lay back, and let that kid screw her every night? 

 'You won't mind me playing around with Roy then. Just to keep him out of your way?' 

 'Well, err, you're still my wife, until the divorce. Roy is only eighteen, and he's Sandra's son,' Bernard objected. 

 'Of course I don't want to do anything you wouldn't like. It's just that, well, Roy was very nice to me on vacation. If I kept Roy happy, his mother would be happy too,' she suggested, sounding reluctant. 

 He glared at her, wondering what to say. He wanted to just tell her what to do as usual, but sensed that wouldn't work. 

 'If I upset him by not giving him what he wants, he would complain to his mother over something made up. She would send me to my room like a naughty girl, with a spanked bottom. There's nothing to stop him coming to my room, and I'd be trapped. I'd have to do it with her son, to keep him happy,' she heavily spoke, sounding crestfallen. 

 'You're being negative again. It wouldn't be like that, I'm sure,' he said. 

 'Well, I guess so. It just shows how much I need you, sir. I know you have another woman now, but I still need you to tell me what to do, sir,' she pathetically spoke. 

 The frown creasing his brow eased. He was pleased to see her return to being the dutiful wife he was comfortable with. It had taken her awhile to learn to accept his authority in the home, but she had complied with his wishes in the end. 

 'Don't worry, I'll be there to tell you what to do. After all, you'll be my niece, so of course it will be expected,' he firmly said. 

 'But what about when the house is sold, sir? You said I'll have to move out, and get my own place. I'm not sure I can cope on my own. Not without you, sir,' she moaned. 

 'Well, it would be difficult. I'm not sure,' he said. 

 'Maybe once the house is sold I could pay my way, to stay on,' she offered. 

 She saw his eyes light up, as he made the connection she was leading to. 

 'If you gave over your half of the house sale, you could to stay,' he carefully suggested. 

 'But what if she decided I should leave? I wouldn't have anywhere to go, and wouldn't have you to tell me what to do, sir. Maybe you could make it a permanent arrangement, with a guarantee?' she coyly asked. 

 'How so?' he asked. 

 'Perhaps you two could adopt me. As my parent you'd naturally have all the money, to do with as you wish. I'd have to obey you as a dutiful daughter, and I wouldn't have to worry about anything, with you telling me what to do. I'd be a good obedient girl, and do as I'm told, honest, sir,' she sincerely spoke. 

 He was lost on the idea of having the whole sale price, all to himself. She could see in his eyes, he was counting the money already. 

 'Please, sir! I don't know what I'd do without you. I need you to look after me, otherwise I get into such a mess. Look what happened on vacation. It was a terrible humiliation. If you hadn't made me see it through, everyone would have known my stupid mistake. It would have been much worse, with gossip going all over the hotel,' she whimpered. 

 He was only half listening, and didn't know what to say. He wondered if it would work, but wanting the money overrode his doubts. 

 'I really, really, need you to look after me, sir. Please say you will, please,' she begged. 

 'I, err, guess so. I'm not sure how it could be arranged,' he murmured. 

 'I'd go to high school like a good schoolgirl. It would soon become a habit, acting like a kid. I'm sure if you gave me a chance, I could do it,' she said. 

 'I could alter your birth certificate. I don't suppose they would look into it much. As your uncle, and only relative, it would be a pretty straight forward case,' he muttered. 

 She was calling him sir, and was eager to please, so he took it as a sign of her capitulation to what he wanted. He was looking pleased with himself. 

 She could see he was thinking about it, and the idea of having the entire house sale price clouded his judgement. Janice was enjoying the ruse, trying hard not to let it show. 

 'I'd call you daddy, and Sandra, mummy. Your girl promises to try really, really hard to please you, and be a good girl. If I'm naughty you can spank me, so I'd try even harder to be a good girl, and do as I'm told. I'll keep Roy happy for you, even if I have to let him do naughty things to me,' she eagerly promised. 

 'Well, hold on. We need to take it a stage at a time. Sandra thinks you're my niece and your parents are, err, gone. That last bit is true. Let's just see how it goes,' he advised. 

 'I'm sure you'd like me to be your obedient little girl for the rest of my life. Well yes, of course it would be difficult. I'm sure you can make it work, sir. You always know what to do, and I promise to be an obedient girl for you, sir,' she enthused, laying it on thick. 

 'It might work. I'd need all the money from the house. You'd have to do as I tell you, all the time. If you don't, you'd be treated like a naughty girl, of course, otherwise they might find out,' he mused. 

 'I can understand your reluctance, sir. It would be a confusing family situation. I would have lost my virginity to my new father, and would be sleeping with my new brother,' she curtly said. 

 'What!' he exclaimed, as her words, and the edge to her voice sank in. 

 'You're expecting your wife to act like an obedient girl, and go back to school while you fuck your girlfriend. You're going to pay your wife pocket money, to fuck your girlfriend's son,' she angrily shouted. 

 'It's not like that! You're twisting my words,' he shouted back. 

 'You demand half the value of this house, and you're preparing to take the lot! Doesn't matter what you put me through, just so long as you can have what you want. My parents paid for it, you'll not see a penny, I promise you that,' she said, with quiet anger pouring out. 

 'No way! I deserve half at least,' he shouted. 

 'You are a selfish bastard! I see that now! I'll keep the lot, and sue for half your income,' she calmly goaded him.  

 

 

===

He took a step toward her looking menacing. In the past she would have backed down. Not now. She held her position, determined to stare him out. Another step closer, and she was pleased to see a slight doubt creep across his face. 

 For all the past times he had overruled her opinions, and made her feel small, she lashed out. A slow long swing of a small fist would have been easy to avoid, except it wasn't anticipated. Not even considered. The slight woman didn't have much power behind her, but the swing had momentum. 

 It connected with his nose. A squidgy unpleasant sound. He yelped in agony, and curled up with a painful, broken nose. He didn't have the decency to stand like a man, instead he whimpered, while bent over holding his bleeding nose. 

 With a cruel pleasure she hadn't realised was there, she kicked him between the legs. He went down yelping like a pathetic puppy. Unfortunately her shoes were soft, but none of this had been planned. She kicked him in the kidneys, not really knowing where to, or even if she made contact. 

 Her fist hurt, and toes pained, but it looked as though he was feeling it more. 

 

 'I'll give you five minutes to get out. Never come back. My lawyer will contact you. Until then, no contact. Got it!' she calmly stated. 

 He tried to speak but couldn't. He nodded his head. She dragged a chair over, so he could pull himself off the floor. As he did so, he moaned and groaned, and she enjoyed every sound of the sweet music. Still in shock, he said nothing. Maybe she should have invited him around once a week, for more of the same. 

 He leaned against the door, trying to get his breath back. He thought she was a push over. Someone was behind this, telling her what to do. 

 Janice slammed the door behind him, with a sound of finality. She picked up a leaflet from the hall table, advertising a local gym. 

 'Yes. I need to get fit. Forget the small tits. I'm now an empowered woman. I'll live my life how I want to from now on,' she proudly declared. Report_Story
