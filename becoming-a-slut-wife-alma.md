 ****** Becoming A Slut Wife: Alma ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© Okay, so I married her for her money. So what? She got her moneys worth out of the deal. She got an attentive husband, a damned good sex life (something she'd never had before) and no more lonely nights. I in turn got something that I'd never had before - a life where I didn't have to worry about where next months rent was going to come from or would I be able to come up with enough to buy groceries for the coming week. 

 Besides, it wasn't as if I had to beat other suitors off with a stick. Alma wasn't exactly a raving beauty. She was as homely as a mud fence. She did have a pretty nice body though; although from the way she dressed you would never know it. I found out by accident and I was just enough of a cock hound to overlook the homeliness just to get some of her pussy and one thing led to another and here we are. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Alma was in my Managerial Economics class and I knew her name, but not much else about her. To be honest about it I never expected to learn much else about her. One the homely side and a little dumpy looking in the sack dresses she always wore there wasn't anything there to attract me. She was also very shy and if you happened to look at her she would quickly look away. No, definitely not someone that I would take the time to get to know. 

 Don't get me wrong here; I wasn't the campus stud and a good half (better make that two-thirds) of the women I chased after turned their nose up at me and those that didn't weren't interested in me for anything more than the short- term. 

 One night on my way home from classes I saw a woman on the side of the road changing a tire. It was raining cats and dogs and the woman was soaking wet and obviously having problems with the car jack. I pulled over and got out to help and saw that it was Alma. She looked like a drown rat. Her car had fabric seats so I made her sit on the vinyl seats in my car while I took care of her flat. 

 When I was done I got in my car, started it up and as I started to pull away Alma said, "What are you doing?" 

 "I live two blocks from here and I'm going to get you into something dry and warm before letting you go back to your car. The way you are now you would soak your seats clear through." 

 "That's not necessary, please let me out." 

 "It is necessary. You sit behind me in Econ and the last thing I need is to sit there and have to listen to you cough and sneeze if you catch cold." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We got to my place and I gave her a clean towel and told her to take a hot shower while I found something dry that might fit. She kept protesting that it wasn't necessary and I just ignored her and pressed on. I had a few odds and ends that various ex-girlfriends had left behind and I gathered them up, cracked open the bathroom door when I heard the shower start and tossed them inside. I wasn't trying to sneak a peek, but I did happen to glance at the mirror and it showed a naked Alma and as I closed the door I wondered why in the hell she was hiding that body under shapeless dresses. 

 When Alma finally came out of the bathroom I saw that the clothes that I had rounded up for her didn't fit all that well - they were too tight and looking at that tightly wrapped body I wondered again why she hid it. She noticed my expression and asked, "Something wrong?" 

 "No, nothing wrong." 

 "Then why are you looking at me like that?" 

 "Because it has been a long time since I have seen a body that sexy." 

 "No one has ever said that to me before." 

 "How would they know? You keep it hidden under all those loose fitting bag dresses." 

 "You really think that it is sexy?" 

 She was a virgin although you never would have believed it from the way she behaved. I'm still not sure who seduced whom, but she came after me with a hunger that wasn't to be believed. She was hot, she was eager, and for her first time she was a better fuck than most of the girls I'd had who had long ago given up their cherry. 

 Alma was insatiable and she on wanted to fuck long after I lost the ability to get it up again. When I dropped her back at her car she said, "Can we do it again?" 

 "We can if you want to." 

 "Tomorrow? After class?" 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Homely or no, there was no way I was not going to take advantage of the situation as long as I could. I didn't even have to worry about being seen in public with her because all she wanted to do was follow me home from class, go to bed and fuck until I couldn't get hard again. Then she would say, "Tomorrow? After class?" and I'd nod a yes. And the one great thing about the situation was that I had no competition because Alma still came to class in those god awful shapeless sacks she wore and no one else ever knew what she had. 

 Our affair was in its fifth month when I got a phone call from the ABC Corporation asking me to come in for an interview. I couldn't remember sending them a resume, but graduation was fast approaching and I still didn't have a job lined up so I said okay. 

 I showed up at the appointed time and place and was almost immediately ushered into the office of a Mr. Jason Thurgood. He cut right to it. 

 "Mr. Fox, what are your intentions toward my daughter?" 

 "You are Alma's father?" 

 "I am, and I want to know just how you see your relationship with my daughter." 

 What's a polite way of saying, "Well sir, I'm just fucking her until something better comes along." But I guess I didn't have to tell him that because what he said next pretty much told me that he all ready knew it. 

 "I am concerned about my daughters welfare Mr. Fox. May I call you Brian?" 

 I said by all means and he went on. "Circumstances dictate that I keep a close eye on her and so I knew immediately when you two started spending time together. In fact, my men were getting ready to move in and change Alma's tire for her when you came along. I am not a stupid man Brian and I'm sure that you know that I know what I'm saying when I say "spending time together." My question was "What are your intentions," but I saw from the look on your face when I asked it what the truthful answer would be. But then, you wouldn't have given me a truthful answer, would you." 

 He looked at me for several seconds and then he said, "No, no you wouldn't have. Anyway, as I've said, I am concerned about Alma's welfare so when she took up with you I had you investigated. You were only able to attend college because of scholarships and your job prospects are not all that great. With just a BA in Business you won't find much out there except at an entry level position that will probably prove to be a dead end unless you come up with an MBA. I would like to make you a proposition Brian, one that will benefit the three of us, you, me and Alma. Would you be interested in hearing it?" 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 To sum things up, Thurgood was extremely wealthy and very much aware that he had a homely daughter. I was the only male who had ever shown an interest in her and at least as far as he could tell, she was happier now than she had been since she was old enough to start grade school and be taunted by the other kids. He wanted her to remain happy. 

 I left Thurgoods office feeling like I hit been hit by a runaway truck, but also considerably richer than I had been when I walked in. It was complicated, but I didn't care because for the first time in my life I could actually see a future for myself. 

 Thurgood would use his influence to get me into the MBA program at the Harvard Business School, he would pay for the education and he would deposit seventy- five thousand into my checking account. Those were immediate and only required that I ask Alma to marry me. If she said no I would still get them just for asking. If she said yes, on the day I said "I do" he would establish an interest bearing irrevocable trust fund in my name with the stipulation that Alma and I remain married for ten years before I could touch it. If I left Alma for any reason other than her infidelity before the ten years were up I would get twenty-five thousand for each year we were married. If she divorced me for any reason other than my infidelity or physical abuse I would be entitled to the trust fund. If she divorced me for either of the mentioned reasons I would get squat. 

 And there was more. He would find a place for me at ABC. He couldn't do it before the wedding because it would look like he was buying Alma a husband (which he was), but he would do it as soon as I had my MBA. The wedding gifts would include a house and sufficient cash to enable us to live until I was out of school and working and he would continue Alma's five grand a month allowance. Last, but by no means least, Alma was never to know about the arrangement. 

 So, there it was. I proposed, Alma accepted, we were married and I got my MBA and the job at ABC. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The first six years were good ones. The marriage worked although there were occasional whispers that I'd married into the family out of greed. Alma became even more insatiable now that we had more than just evenings after classes to work with and sometimes I despaired of even being able to get out of bed in the morning, let alone get out of bed and go to work. 

 The job was working out fine. My first day at work my father in law called me into his office and laid down the ground rules. 

 "I gave you the job, but I don't play favorites. Whether or not you go anywhere in this company is strictly up to you." 

 I'd expected no less and I'm pretty sure that I surprised the hell out of him when I started moving up in the company. By my third year I was a regional manager and by the end of my fifth year I was a divisional manager and had a better than average shot at the next vice-presidency. 

 I think that he was also surprised that my marriage to his daughter was not just a marriage in name only. Alma was happy and between the hours I spent at work and the hours I spent buried in Alma I didn't have time to do anything that would fuck things up. Not that I ever intended to - not with the pot of gold waiting for me at the end of the ten year rainbow. You have any idea how much interest 500k can draw over ten years? No sir! No way was I going to do anything that would fuck that up. 

 Well, fucked up things did get, but not by me - it was all Alma. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Three things happened to change things. First, Alma decided to give me a present. She had plastic surgery done and had given herself a face that complimented her fabulous body. Secondly, that new face made her feel sexier and that translated to a constantly worn out Brian and Alma was frustrated at being left wanting more and not being able to get it. The third, and probably the most disastrous was that she finally began hearing the whispers that I had married into the family out of greed. 

 The first hint that I had that there was trouble was when Alma stopped trying to fuck me to death. She still came after me almost every night, but it wasn't the frenzied coupling that it had been. Next came the not being home when I got there, nights out with her girl friends that she came home late from, and on those nights she always showered before she came to bed. She said it was because she wanted to wash the stink of cigarette smoke off of her before she curled up next to me. 

 I had no idea that these were the classic signs of infidelity. Why would I think that? No one had ever looked twice at Alma before. But I hadn't considered that there was a new Alma - an Alma with a beautiful face. Then I began to hear rumors about Alma - rumors of wild behavior on her 'nights out with the girls.' I still didn't think of other men; I just figured that Alma was letting loose for the first time in her life and who was I to begrudge her that. 

 Six months went by and then one day my father in law called me into his office. 

 "What are you going to do about Alma?" 

 "About what?" 

 "You don't know? No, I can see that you don't. Well, it's your life and it isn't up to me to meddle." 

 "But you already have meddled. By bringing me in here and starting this conversation you meddled. Spit it out dad; you and I have no secrets where Alma is concerned, except from her of course." 

 "Well Brian, even though Alma is married I still keep a fairly close eye on her. It became a habit when there was that rash of kidnapping businessmen and their families and a man in my position worries about things like that. The truth is that my daughter is fast becoming a cock crazy slut. She has had affairs with seven men in the last six months. I can see that the news shocks you." 

 All I could do was shake my head yes. 

 "What are you going to do about it?" 

 "I don't know?" 

 "You don't know? It is your golden opportunity Brian. It may sound strange coming from me, but you don't have to put up with that shit. You could hire a private detective, get the goods on her and get out from under. Our agreement gives you an out for infidelity. You have all ready done better by her than I had any right to expect and don't sweat your job here either." 

 "Thanks, that's nice to know." 

 "Well, let me know what you are going to do." 

 "I already know." 

 "What?" 

 "Nothing at the moment. I need to see if there isn't some way to work things out with her." 

 "For God's sake why?" 

 "Because dad, somewhere along the way I fell in love with my wife." 

 "Oh you poor bastard." 

 "Yeah, ain't that a bitch." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was two nights after my meeting with my father in law before Alma had another girl's night out. I made sure that I was waiting up for her when she got home at three in the morning. 

 "What are you doing up?" 

 "Waiting for you." 

 "Why? Don't you have to be to work in the morning?" 

 "Yeah, but for some reason I'm horny as a goat and I have been eagerly awaiting your getting home." 

 "All right! That's my Tiger. Just let me take a quick shower." 

 "No baby, I want you right now, right here on the floor and just the way you are." 

 I started to unbutton her blouse and she tried to pull away from me. 

 "No honey, let me go wash the cigarette stink off me. I won't feel right making love stinking the way I do." 

 "If I didn't know better Alma, I'd think that you were trying to hide something from me." 

 I saw her face change and she said, "Okay Brian, I would rather not have done it this way, but since you are pushing it I might as well get it over with. I've been with another man tonight and I wanted to do you the courtesy of washing him off me before getting in bed with you. You still in a hurry to have me now?" 

 That was a cold shot. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't the in your face I just fucked another man. 

 "No I guess not Alma, not since you put it that way." 

 "Run on up to bed Brian. I'll take a shower and then we can make love." 

 "I don't know about that Alma." 

 "About what Brian?" 

 "About making love Alma. It doesn't sound as if there will be much love there, at least on your part." 

 "Oh come off of it Brian. You didn't marry me for love, you married me for my money, but don't sweat it baby, I'm not all that unhappy about it. I've been getting my moneys worth." 

 "Where did you get the idea that I married you for your money?" 

 "All I had to do was look in the mirror Brian. I know that you didn't marry me for my looks." 

 "True, you weren't that great a beauty then, but you were a beautiful person and the most fantastic piece of ass I'd ever run across and that was enough for me. I don't know where you came up with the idea that it was your money that I married you for. If you will think back Alma, it wasn't until after I asked you to marry me that you introduced me to your family and I found out they had money. After I asked you to marry me Alma. Remember? After I asked you to marry me? But you have obviously made up your mind so there isn't much use in continuing this conversation." 

 I headed upstairs and went to bed. Alma took a shower and then she got in bed with me and reached for my cock. "Come on Tiger, let's take care of that horny feeling of yours." 

 "Leave me alone Alma. I don't want anything to do with you now." 

 "Sure you do baby, you just don't realize it yet. Alma will make it better." 

 I tried to turn away from her and push her away, but she did not intend to be denied and once she locked her mouth on my cock the treacherous thing wouldn't listen to me either. When I was hard she climbed on top of me and rode me, rocking back and forth as she looked down at me. 

 "Nothing has to change baby. I like being married to you and I have no intention of pushing you out of my bed, but while being married to you is nice and it is convenient, it is not a necessity. As long as you don't get difficult about the way things are going to be from now on I see no reason to change anything. Look on the bright side baby. You had a hard time satisfying me on your own. Now you have some help to take the pressure off." 

 She got me up two more times that night and even though I really didn't want to she wouldn't take no for an answer. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 She was still sleeping when I left for work and I spent most of the day trying to figure out what I was going to do. There had to be some way that I could put the marriage back the way it was. At least that is what I thought until I got home from work that night. I walked into the house and found Alma and some guy I didn't know making out on the couch in the living room. 

 They broke apart long enough for Alma to say, "I thought that since you now know what I'm doing there isn't much sense in my sneaking around to do it." 

 She turned back to the guy but he held her away from him and looked at me, "Who is he?" 

 "That's just my husband. Don't worry about him, we have an arrangement." 

 "We do?" 

 "Don't be a boor Brian. We covered this last night." 

 "No we didn't Alma, we didn't cover anything. You talked a lot of bullshit and I listened because I just happened to be there. I didn't agree to shit and I'm not agreeing to shit." 

 The guy started to get up and said, "Hey, I didn't sign on to get in the middle of a family argument." 

 "Sit down pal. There isn't any argument here. She has just decided that she doesn't want to be married to me any more. Go ahead and enjoy. Take it from me, she's the best piece of ass that you'll ever have." 

 I left them alone in the living room and went upstairs and packed a bag. I heard Alma's familiar screams echo through the house and I knew I was going to miss her. When Alma took her shower and came to bed I wasn't there. We have a four-bedroom house and it took her a minute or so to find the spare bedroom I was staying in - it was the one with the locked door. She wasn't going to get me hard in spite of myself that night. 

 "Brian, open this door Brian." 

 "Go away Alma, we have nothing to talk about. You have already made things perfectly clear and I'm not going to waste anymore time trying to convince you that you are wrong." 

 "Brian, stop being silly and open this door." 

 "Go away Alma." 

 "Brian, I won't have this. Now you open this door right now, you hear me?" 

 I put a pillow over my head, but I could still hear her as she beat on the door and hollered at me for the next five minutes before giving up and going to bed. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day I was up and out of the house before Alma was up and I followed my father in law's advice. As soon as I got to work I arranged for a private detective and then I made arrangements to move into the company's apartment at the Embassy Suites until the dust settled. I didn't go home that night and Alma called my cell phone a half dozen times but I never took the calls or called her back. She was on the phone to me five minutes after I got to the office the next day.  

 

 ****** Becoming A Slut Wife: Alma ****** byJust_Plain_Bob© "Where were you last night?" 

 "Moving in to my new apartment." 

 "Brian, what are you doing?" 

 "I'm getting out Alma. It seems that you don't want to be my wife anymore and that somehow you got the idea that you could be a whore and it would be okay with me." 

 "Brian, you aren't thinking clearly on this. We both know that you married me for my money and pretending to be the outraged loving husband is a waste of time. I told you that it didn't matter. Now I'll expect to see you tonight. I'll have dinner ready and then we can go to bed and I'll show you how much it doesn't matter to me." 

 I said, "Goodbye Alma" and I hung up on her. 

 I didn't go home that night and I didn't take Alma's calls the next day. I went and talked with my father in law and told him what was happening and why. 

 "She actually brought him home while you were there?" 

 "Yep." 

 "God, what has gotten into that child." 

 "If I had to guess I'd say that it was her new face. She is no longer the ugly duckling and she's trying to make up for all that she thinks she missed out on. I'm going to need some time off. I'm not taking her calls and sooner or later she will just come down here to the office and I don't want to see her or talk to her until I serve her with the papers." 

 "You are determined to divorce her?" 

 "I don't want to, but if she doesn't change I don't see that I have a choice." 

 "I'm sorry that I got you into this Brian." 

 "Hey, I went for your offer out of pure greed dad. I'm as surprised as anyone as to how it turned out. I'm not sorry I did it, I'm just sorry its ending." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 My cell phone rang a dozen times a day for the next two weeks and I didn't answer it if I didn't know who the caller was. Alma figured out that I was using caller ID to screen out her calls and she tried using pay phones or a friend's phone and if she got through I immediately hung up. 

 The day my lawyer called and told me that the divorce papers had been served I finally took a call from Alma. 

 "Brian damn you, where have you been, why haven't you taken my calls and what the hell is this about a divorce?" 

 "You are a college graduate Alma so you should be able to figure out that your third question is the answer to the first two." 

 "Brian you are being stupid about this. We don't have to be divorced. I told you honey, I like being married to you. You don't have to do this." 

 "Of course I do Alma. It is a pride thing, an ego thing if you will. No man, if he is any kind of man at all, is going to let his wife pull the shit on him that you have been pulling on me. My detective, the one who took the photos that were in the envelope with the divorce papers, also found out that you have been doing this shit for the last seven or eight months. Did you get a kick out of it Alma? Did it turn you on to come home to me and let me go down on you after you had been with another man?" 

 "I never did that to you Brian. I always showered and douched before getting in bed with you." 

 "Sure you did Alma and we are both absolutely sure that the douching got every last little bit of your lover out of you, aren't we? Did you always brush your teeth and gargle? I know how much you like to suck cock Alma so how many times did you kiss me with peter breath?" 

 There was silence on her end of the line. 

 "What, no answer to that one? Well here is another one you can try and answer. What did the divorce papers ask for? You don't have to answer that one either; I'll do it for you. They don't ask for a thing. Not the house, not the furniture, no settlement of any kind. All they ask for is to let me out. I walked into my marriage with nothing but my love for you and I'm leaving with nothing but my pride. That's how much your money means to me." 

 "Please don't do this Brian. We can work it out." 

 "No we can't Alma. It was too late to work things out when you brought that asshole home with you and fucked him in my house and it was already too late when you started using that bullshit about my marrying you for your money as an excuse for fucking other guys. That is a lie that you tell yourself so you won't feel bad about what you have been doing to me. The truth is that you had plastic surgery and now all of a sudden men are hitting on you and trying to get you into their beds. 

 "You lived your life as an ugly duckling who was ignored and now that you have turned into a beautiful swan you have decided to make up for lost time, to see what all you have missed out on. Well you got it Alma. You always had the sexy body and now you have the face to match. Don't sweat it Alma, your bed will never be empty. Goodbye Alma." 

 As I hung up the phone I looked across the desk at my father in law, "How did I do dad?" 

 A little melodramatic, but not bad, not bad at all. In fact, if I'd have had a son I could only have prayed that he be as big an asshole." 

 "Heady praise coming from the master." 

 "What now?" 

 "Well, I'm not dumb, so I guess we will go through with the divorce. After that, we will just have to see." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It wasn't easy avoiding Alma until the divorce was final, but with the help of a few others I managed it. The receptionist in the lobby warned me every time Alma came into the building and I managed to be gone from my office when she got there. 

 The security guards let me know whenever she camped out in the parking lot next to my car and I would call a cab and have it pick me up at the loading dock out back. 

 She tried going through her father, but he wouldn't help her. "You made your bed Alma. Brian didn't deserve what you did to him so you have no one to blame but yourself." 

 We lived in a No Fault state so she couldn't contest the divorce, but she did show up in court the day the divorce was granted. She came up to me when it was over. 

 "Please Brain, talk to me." 

 "Nothing to say Alma, you said it all the last night we lived together, remember? Let me see if I can remember the exact words. "While being married to you is nice and it is convenient it is not a necessity. As long as you don't get difficult about the way things are going to be from now on I see no reason to change things." Is that about right? Well consider this as my being difficult Alma. 

 "Oh, and one last thing, let's read this decree together to see just how your money hungry ex made out after marrying you for your money. Where is it? It must be in here some where. Damn. Nothing, not a dime. In fact it even says that I have to pay attorneys fees and court costs. Boy, did I ever fuck up. Marry you for your money and end up with nothing and have to take money out of my own pocket to pay for the divorce. I'll just have to do better the next time I marry for money." 

 "Brian, please. Let me talk to you. Please listen to me Brian." 

 "I did listen Alma. I listened to my private detective tell me about nine of the men you fucked behind my back. I listened to your screams and moans when you brought a man into my house and fucked him while I was there. It's over Alma. Rejoice at seeing the gold digging asshole slinking away with out a dime of yours in his pockets. Now if you will excuse me I have a date with a woman who will try to help me start a new life. It won't be much of a start though; the lady is as poor as a church mouse so marrying her for her money will be a waste of time, but then I don't do well at that, do I?" 

 I turned and walked to the back of the courtroom where a drippingly gorgeous blonde stood waiting for me. She had been hired from an escort agency just for the occasion, but Alma didn't know that. I offered the blond my arm, she took it and we left. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The divorce decree, the pictures and the detective's report satisfied the requirements and the trust was released to me. I offered Jason the 500k back and told him I'd settle for just keeping the interest, but he refused. 

 "A deal is a deal and you more than fulfilled your end of it. What now?" 

 "I don't have a clue." 

 "You going to take her back?" 

 "What kind of a deal do I get this time?" 

 "Asshole!" 

 "Yes dad, but an asshole after your own heart." 

 "You do know that she hasn't seen another man since a week after you left and she finally realized you weren't coming back?" 

 "No, I didn't know that. The main reason that I went forward with the divorce is because I didn't think she would stop. I thought that once she shed the ugly duckling image and started to get hit on that she would glory in it too much to stop." 

 "You still love her?" 

 "Fraid so." 

 "Well, from all the crying on my shoulder that she has done I know that she knows that she fucked up big time and I also know that she loves you." 

 "She didn't get it wrong dad. She was right; I did marry her for the money. What she did wrong was to not confront me with it so we could have worked it out. Hell, if she had confronted me I would have admitted it, not your part of course, but I would have told her that I married into the family because of the money and then I would have shown her that everything had changed and that I'd come to love her for herself and that I'd prove it by signing a predated prenuptial. And that was before her new face. That new face is what fucked everything up." 

 "You still haven't answered my question. What now?" 

 "I avoided her until the divorce was final. Now that it is over I will no longer be unavailable. If she wants to chase me fine, but she is going to have to do all the work and she is going to have to convince me that she is worth taking back." 

 "Why not cut out the bullshit. I'll make you a vice president if you'll marry my daughter." 

 "No dice dad. You'll make me a vice president even if I don't marry your daughter." 

 "Yeah, you're probably right." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 It took her a while, mostly because I wouldn't make it easy for her, but Alma finally got me to agree to talk to her. I listened for three hours as she confessed and begged me to forgive her. I told her that I didn't know if I ever could do that and that even if I could it would take me a hell of a long time to get over what she had done. We left it that we would get together and talk again and we did. 

 She invited me home to have dinner with her and I told her that I would never set foot in that house again because I would always hear the noises echoing through the halls that she and her lover had made that night. It was all bullshit of course, I was deliberately trying to make things hard for her. She surprised the hell out of me by putting the house up for sale the very next day. 

 Alma tried hard and I gave ground a little bit at a time until the day came when she asked me to marry her again. 

 "If I do there is one condition that you will have to meet." 

 "What's that?" 

 "You will have to sign a prenuptial agreement. Now that I'm a vice president and dragging down a big salary I have to make sure that you aren't marrying me for my money." Report_Story
