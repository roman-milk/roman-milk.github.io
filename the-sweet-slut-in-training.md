 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 01 ****** bydlsloan© Chapter One: Between a rock and a hard place 

 Valarie Evans slammed the door shut and sprinted to the kitchen, grabbing a bottle of water and chugging it as quickly as she could. She could still taste the bitter, salty stuff in her mouth and she wanted it out. She stripped off her thin shirt on her way to the shower. She hoped the warm, soapy water would wash away her shame, but it was still there even as she toweled off and put on her warm cotton winter pajamas, even though it was still mid-morning. She felt cold and vulnerable and exposed, but mostly ashamed at what she had just done. She tried watching TV, reading a book and surfing on the Internet, but her mind kept flashing back to what happened. 

 Just a month ago, she had a boyfriend, was still living in Scotland, had graduated with honors from a prestigious university and was the good girl she had been all her life. Now, she had no boyfriend, she was living in the United States and the sticky wet spots on her couch reminded her that she was anything but a sweet innocent girl anymore. 

 Valarie was 23 and certainly had had sex before, but only a few times with boyfriends. It was never wild or rough or adventurous, unless you called giving your boyfriend a blowjob in the car in front of his parents' house adventurous. She had thought it was incredibly exciting and dangerous at the time, but now, five years later, she knew there was much she didn't know about sex. And after tonight, she wasn't sure she wanted to learn. Or did she? 

 It all started a little over a month ago when Valarie's boyfriend, Sebastian, announced he was moving to New Zealand for his job with an international software company. He said it had always been his dream. Valarie was disappointed to lose him, but knew in her heart that they would never have lasted anyway. They parted on good terms and Sebastian even helped her when she decided to follow his lead and her dream of moving to the United States. She had always wanted to go. She dreamed of being a lawyer in some big-city law firm, sending criminals to jail and championing the common man. 

 She had the grades and credentials to succeed, she believed, and decided to move to the States in hopes of working in a law firm and perhaps applying for law school. Sebastian had a friend in the States named Roy. They had been friends as teenagers before Roy moved to the States to live with his dad. Valarie was especially excited to learn that Roy was a lawyer at a firm in Baltimore. It was too good to be true. 

 Sebastian called Roy and Roy agreed to meet Valarie at the airport and help her get settled. He didn't have a job for her, but he had contacts and would help her look. Despite knowing she would miss home, she jumped at the chance. She didn't own much, so packing was easy. Just her clothes and a few books and pictures and she was ready. She knew as her plane took off that she was in for the adventure of a lifetime. Little did she know just how adventurous it would actually be. 

 It all started well enough. Roy met her at the airport and Valarie found him to be quite charming and sweet. He was six feet tall with sandy colored hair and lean, athletic body. Valarie knew that Roy was probably about 27, the same age as Sebastian. 

 Roy greeted her with a smile and a quick glance up and down her body, the sort of look Valarie had learned to expect from men. Valarie was 5 feet, 6 inches tall with striking hazel eyes and silky black hair that hung straight down to her shoulders. She was trim, with a curvy 34B-28-36 body that featured long, silky smooth legs and a firm round ass. Her breasts were average size and a nice round shape that seemed to fit perfectly in a man's palm. She was fit and trim and in her prime. She was tantalizingly firm in some places and deliciously supple and soft in others. The daughter of French Canadian and Scottish parents, her dark features included lightly tanned skin that accentuated her curves, particularly the shape of her long, toned legs and her flat tummy. She was the type of woman who got more beautiful the longer you looked at her. She didn't have the brazen beauty of a supermodel, but her eyes melted many a heart, her smile lit up a room and her ass in motion was pure joy to watch. 

 Valarie knew she was attractive, but her looks weren't overwhelming or intimidating to men. She appealed to them with her tight body, stunning eyes and smile and genuinely sweet nature. She was the sort of girl who you could take home proudly to mom, but who would also make every other guy in the room at a party jealous. 

 All that combined with her intelligence and Valarie seemingly had the world at her feet. There was little doubt she would have a great career, marry a handsome man with an equally great career and they would have beautiful children and a gorgeous house. That's how life worked for women like Valarie Evans. Most of the time. 

 Roy proved to be a gentleman, carrying her bags to his SUV and opening the door for her. 

 "I can't thank you enough for helping me like this," Valarie said in her Scottish accent that only made her seem cuter. "Sebastian said you were a great guy." 

 "Happy to do it," Roy said. "I gotta give you credit. It has to be pretty intimidating to come to a new country and not really know anyone or even have a place to stay. I admire that. Shows a lot of charcter." 

 "Thanks," Valarie said, blushing slightly. She felt warm and realized she had overdressed. It was a warm spring day and Roy was wearing khaki shorts, sandals and a polo shirt. She, on the other hand, was wearing jeans that hugged her ass nicely and a short-sleeved sweater. "Um, I hate to ask, but do you think we could stop somewhere where I could change clothes? I didn't realize it would be so warm here." 

 "No problem," Roy said as they merged onto the freeway. "But it will be a few minutes and we don't have a lot of time to find you an apartment today. If you want, you can climb in the back and change there. I promise I won't spy on you." 

 "Oh," Valarie nodded. She weighed her options quickly. She didn't want to seem rude by saying she'd rather wait. He seemed very nice and it's not like he was going to molest her right here on the freeway. He was Sebastian's friend, which made him her friend, too. Plus, she'd still have her underwear on and it would only take a second. And she really was too warm for this weather. "Thanks. I'll be right back." 

 She unbuckled and crawled between the captain's chair style seats into the back of the SUV, well aware that her ass was right next to his face for a few seconds while she tried to wriggle into the back. He said he wouldn't look, but Valarie knew any man would find it difficult to pass on such a golden opportunity. Thinking about it, she actually slowed down, making sure he had time for a good look. He'd been nice to her, the least she could do was give him a little chance to ogle. Plus, she knew her ass was one of her best features, so if that helped make a good first impression, so be it. 

 The ass show continued, she realized, when she leaned over the back seat and fumbled through her suitcases, trying to find some other clothes. All Roy had to do was adjust the rearview mirror and he could take a good long look. Her jeans were tight and her ass round and firm, so she knew it would be a nice view. 

 Finally she found some white athletic shorts that she liked to wear when she played soccer or jogged and a canary yellow tank top that stopped at her belly button. She made no effort to rush or hide herself, but she didn't put on a show either. The car swerved suddenly and Roy blurted, "Sorry." Valarie just grinned and said, "Not distracted by anything are you?" 

 "No, not at all," Roy joked, knowing he had been busted. "I have hot girls getting naked in the backseat of my car all the time." 

 "I'm hardly naked," Valarie said, sliding back into the front seat next to him, her shorts and tank top now in place. She had replaced her socks and tennis shoes with a nice pair of open-toed sandals with a two-inch heel that was just enough to give her calves that extra curve guys seemed to like. Valarie wasn't trying to attract Roy – he was Sebastian's friend and that would be weird – but she still wanted to put her best foot – and other body parts – forward. 

 "OK," Roy said, "I've got five places that I picked out to try for an apartment. These are places that met your price range and had a room available immediately. If none of these work, we'll find you a hotel for the night or something." 

 "I'm sure one of them will be fine," Valarie said. "I'm not too picky and I don't need much room. I have nothing but those bags in the back." 

 "Yeah, and I have a couch for you. Once you get your place, I'll bring it over," Roy said, referring to a conversation he'd had with Sebastian. He'd told his friend that he was selling his old couch and Sebastian convinced him to give it to Valarie. 

 The first three stops proved frustrating. One place was rundown and had an odd smell. Another sat right on a very busy roadway and above a nightclub. The third was OK, but Roy warned that the neighborhood wasn't safe. Finally, the fourth one was a small building with a total of 12 units. It wasn't in great shape, but it wasn't rundown either. It was in a decent neighborhood and the offer of a free first month convinced Valarie that this was the right place. 

 The landlord had been unavailable, but his assistant, a pleasant elderly woman, had made the arrangements and Valarie moved in immediately. While she walked to a nearby Wal-Mart to stock up on some essentials, Roy returned to his house to pick up the couch. When he returned, he and Valarie carried it up the stairs to her apartment. On the way, Valarie's shorts caught on a nail in the railing outside the building and ripped up the side, all the way to the waist band. 

 Once they set the couch down in her apartment, she looked at her leg to assess the damage. Roy was looking too. And they both saw her white bikini panties underneath her shorts and the outside of her ass cheek. 

 "Guess these are ruined," Valarie shrugged. 

 "Yeah, you might as well go ahead and take them off right now," Roy joked, glad to hear her laughing right along with him. 

 "Sebastian warned me that you were a naughty boy," Valarie teased. "I didn't believe him, but now I'm not so sure." 

 Roy stayed a few minutes longer, helping her settle in. He gave her his phone number and told her to call if she needed anything. He also gave her a list of local law firms to contact about a job. 

 In the weeks since, Roy had checked on her a couple of times and Valarie had been almost embarrassed to report that she had found no jobs at law firms and was working at the Wal-Mart by her apartment to help pay the bills. She didn't tell him that she had spent almost all her money on essentials and didn't have a TV, car or any furniture besides her couch. 

 At night, she would sit on her couch, surfing the web on her laptop. Bored and lonely, she had searched some adult sites, finding the erotic stories more interesting than the pictures. She'd read a good story, then put on one of her favorite silky nighties and lay back on the couch, gently touching herself, stroking her breasts. She'd cup them, hold them firmly, then ever-so-gently pinch her nipples, which hardened under her warm, soft hands. 

 She let her hands trail down her sides and flat tummy, over her thighs, then between her legs. She rubbed her hands over the carefully trimmed landing strip of dark hair, parting her lips with her long, delicate fingers. She stroked them gently over her pussy lips and rubbed in circles around her wet, swollen clit. Her mind flashed pictures of men. No one man in particular. Just handsome men with chiseled features, hard chests and strong yet gentle hands. She imagined those strong hands stroking her breasts, kissing her neck, rubbing her ass and stroking her thighs. She imagined a rigid, pulsing cock, dripping with pre-cum, parting her sweet pussy lips and stroking her velvety pussy all night long. 

 Valarie would touch herself like this for close to an hour sometimes, stoking her fire a little bit at a time until finally she came. She was always careful not to cry out too loud, for fear of alerting the neighbors through the thin walls. Instead, she would pant and sigh and moan as the waves of pleasure passed through her body. Then, every night, she'd take off her panties and nighty and use them to clean herself and the couch, then she'd curl up nude under a warm blanket and sleep the rest of the night. 

 Her first month in the U.S. had been eye-opening, but despite the fact that she had little money, possessions or a job, she felt free and independent and confident that she had made the right move. She scrimped and saved her pennies as the first month came to a close, taking as many hours at the store as she could, trying to make sure she could pay the rent. The day before the rent was due, she happily dropped a check in the landlord's mail slot. She had paid it on time, in full and still had about $50 left over from her last check. It wasn't much, but she could feed herself and maybe even rent a few DVDs to watch on her laptop. 

 The next morning – a Thursday -- she awoke to a loud pounding on the door. Hurriedly, she grabbed her outfit from the night before. Feeling particularly naughty, she had worn only a sheer white shirt with buttons that went from the collar to between her breasts. She slipped it on, not taking time to button the buttons, knowing full well her cleavage was on display and a hint her light nipples could be seen through the shirt. The shirt was long enough to just barely cover her ass. She looked for a pair of shorts or panties nearby, but could find none. The man at the door was yelling now and she realized it was Mr. Porter, the landlord. 

 She had only met him a couple of times. He didn't seem particularly nice. He was in his 40s, she guessed and had a roughness to him she didn't like. He chewed tobacco, had a scruffy beard and smelled like he had just come from a mechanic's garage. Obviously, the idiot hadn't checked the slot to realize she had already paid the rent. Well, she'd just open the door a crack and tell him and get rid of him. She wrapped her blanket around her and shuffled to the door with only the sheer shirt on. She clutched the blanket tightly and opened the door a crack, peering around at him. 

 She was surprised when he put his hand on the door and pushed it open. She stepped back. She had no choice but to let him in. She clutched her blanket even more tightly as Porter looked at her and frowned. 

 "What's this?" he demanded, waving her check in her face. 

 "The rent," Valarie said. "Did I not put it in the right place?" 

 "You put it in the right place, you just didn't pay enough," Porter said. 

 "Not enough?" Valarie frowned. "But it's the amount your assistant said. I have the contract ..." 

 "Yes, it's the right amount for one month, but you owe for two," Porter said, spitting a wad of tobacco juice in her sink. 

 "Two? I thought the first month was free." 

 "Not free," Porter spat again. "Nothing's free, honey. It just meant you didn't have to pay until the first month was over. Now, you owe for last month and next month. Got another check for me?" 

 "No, I don't," Valarie said shakily. "Look, Mr. Porter, I'm terribly sorry. I misunderstood. I don't have enough money for two months' rent right now. I am working as many hours as I can, though, so I will pay you soon." 

 "How soon?" 

 "Two weeks?" Valarie said, hopefully. 

 "Not soon enough," Porter said. "Pack your shit and get out. You have until noon." 

 He started toward the door, but Valarie stopped him. "Wait, I ... I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have a car to move my things." 

 "Not my problem," Porter said. 

 "There must be some mistake," Valarie said, frustrated and scared now. "Is there any way I can get a little more time? Maybe do some work around the complex. Clean rooms or something?" 

 "Don't need any more cleaning staff," Porter said. "But I feel bad for you – new to the country and all. I tell you what, I'll give you one more night to get out. You have until noon tomorrow. All you have to do is give me a blowjob." 

 Valarie was so struck by his words that she didn't realized what he was saying at first. Then it hit her. "No way," Valarie said angrily. 

 "Fine, out by noon," Porter shrugged, moving toward the door. "Anything you can't take with you, you lose. Leave me some of your panties, will you?" He chuckled and walked out the door. 

 Frantically, Valarie called Roy, but got no answer. She remembered he said he was going out of town to a conference. When did he say he'd be back? She couldn't remember. 

 She looked at her bank statement and through her purse. She didn't have enough for even half of another month's rent. What would she do? She couldn't be on the streets with no money. Plus, she'd only be able to salvage a few things. 

 It quickly became apparent that she really had only one option. She called Porter and said "OK". 

 "OK, what?" Porter teased. Valarie realized he wanted to hear her say it. 

 "OK, I was hoping you would do me the honor of letting me suck your cock," Valarie blurted it out, hoping that saying it quickly would make it less revolting. 

 "Well, since you asked so nicely..." the phone clicked and a few minutes later, he knocked on the door. Valarie opened it. She was still wearing only her shear white shirt, unbuttoned and nothing else. She had dropped the blanket and stood before him, nearly nude, completely vulnerable and ready to do what she had to do to have a place to sleep tonight. What tomorrow would bring, she didn't know, but she'd figure that out later. 

 "I thought you looked like the type who couldn't turn down a nice cock," Porter teased as if he had the greatest gift to women tucked in his pants. He pulled them down and waggled his soft cock at her. "Come and get it, slut." 

 Valarie nearly told him to go to hell, but thought better of it and dropped to her knees. She crawled on her hands and knees over to him, sitting up in front of him, looking at his cock. She had given Sebastian a few blowjobs and enjoyed pleasing him that way. She didn't think she would enjoy this. Sebastian often came quickly and she hoped Mr. Porter would too. 

 She wrapped her mouth around his cock, not wanting to lick it any more than she had to. She began sucking right away and felt him harden quickly. He was calling her names like slut and bitch and whore, but she blocked it out, focused solely on getting him off and out of her apartment. 

 He had his hands on the back of her head and was actually fucking her throat. Sebastian had always been more gentle. He would warn her when he was going to cum and she'd catch it and spit it out into a napkin. She found out soon enough that Porter was having none of that. He hammered his cock in her mouth, making her jaws and neck ache and her eyes water. She hated him. He came in her mouth and held her head firm. She tried to pull away and spit it out, but he wouldn't let her. He pinched her nose shut and said, "Swallow, bitch." Valarie knew she had no choice and, frankly, anything that got his vile seed off her tongue was a welcome option. She swallowed, instantly feeling sick to her stomach. Porter wiped his cock clean in her silky black hair, leaving streaks of cum in it. Then he pulled up his pants and looked down at her, "Tomorrow, the price goes up to pussy if you want another night. Otherwise, I need a check or you're out by noon. I'll be here at 9 a.m. You wanna fuck again, wear something nice." 

 Now, Valarie sat huddled on her lone couch in her warm pajamas, wondering what to do. She had to go to work in an hour. Should she call in sick and go apartment hunting? She didn't even have a car. Plus, she needed the money. No, she had to go to work. If only she could get in touch with Roy. She was sure that he could help. She hated to ask for money, but it was far better than what she had just done.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 01 ****** bydlsloan© Just then, her phone rang. It was Roy, thank heaven! "Roy!" she answered hopefully. 

 "Yeah, did you just call a little bit ago?" 

 "Yes, yes," Valarie said, on the verge of tears. 

 "Sorry, I was checking in at the airport," he said. "I'm getting ready to fly back from that conference." 

 "You are?" Valarie was so happy. "I hate to ask, but I really need your help. Can you please come by as soon as you land?" 

 "Of course," Roy said. "What's wrong?" 

 "I'll explain when you get here," Valarie said, too shaken up to tell him the story. 

 By the time Roy arrived five hours later, Valarie had calmed herself down, using her strong mind and will to keep her focused on the task – finding a new apartment. Matter-of-factly, she told Roy everything that had happened and what Porter had made her do. 

 "I'll take care of this right now," Roy said. He was clearly angry and ready to fight. While Valarie would have loved nothing more than to see Porter get what was coming to him, there was no time. Even if Roy straightened things out, she didn't want to stay here one more night. 

 "Please, just let it go," Valarie pleaded. 

 "OK, I'll drop it for now, but some day, I'll get him back," Roy said. "Look, I'm supposed to go into work and check in. Why don't you come with me and we can ask the guys if they have any suggestions for where you can go?" 

 "I'll take any help I can get," Valarie said. "Oh, do I need to change into something nicer?" 

 Valarie was wearing a pair of denim cutoff shorts that fit tightly around her ass and thighs and came down just past the bottom of her ass cheeks. She had on a white halter top that pushed her breasts together. Her bikini style panties were also white. 

 "You look fine," Roy said. "After all, you don't work there." 

 "OK," Valarie said. Normally, she would have put on some sandals, but she decided that some white pumps would at least make her look a little more stylish. 

 Valarie had never been to Roy's office, but knew he was the youngest staff person at Travers and Nelson. Roy, whose last name was Gordon, had yet to earn partner status, but certainly seemed well on his way. From Roy's description it was a small place with just the three attorneys and a part-time assistant to handle filing and paperwork. They specialized in corporate law and worked with a small but select group of high-priced clients. It sounded a little boring to Valarie, who saw herself in a courtroom arguing cases. But still, she was excited to meet more real-life, successful lawyers who might be able to help her in her career endeavors. 

 Roy introduced her to them all. Bill Travers was the senior member. At age 50, he was handsome with silvery hair and a warm smile. Jim Nelson was in his mid 30s and was the picture of tall, dark and handsome. All of them were single, no doubt due to the long hours required by a top-notch lawyer, Valarie thought. 

 They all greeted her warmly and listened with genuine interest and concern as Roy described her situation, leaving out the incident with Mr. Porter. They through out various suggestions on places to stay, but finally it was Roy who said, "I have an idea. Valarie, could you excuse us for a minute. I need to speak with these guys alone." 

 Valarie went out into the lobby area, picking up a magazine and trying to focus on a story, all the while wondering what they could possibly be discussing. Was Roy going to get her a job here? Oh, that would be fantastic. And maybe they'd give her an advance on her pay and she could go get an apartment. Oh, she hoped it was true. 

 She was surprised at how long it took and envisioned Roy in there, battling for her, trying to convince these men to give her a chance. When Roy came to get her a few minutes later with a big smile on his face, she knew her hopes had come true. 

 She practically skipped back into the office and joined the men at the conference table. She noticed that they all were watching her more intently now, eyes roving to places on her body that men like this were usually more discreet about. She thought little of it. Let them look if it gets me a job and a place to stay. 

 "So, Valarie," Bill Travers said. As the head of the firm, it was no surprise he was doing the talking. "Roy told us some more details about your situation." 

 

 Valarie grew wide-eyed and looked at Roy as if she'd been betrayed. 

 "Now, before you get upset, he did it to help you and I think we can," Travers continued. "I think all five of us in this room have needs and that we can help each other out." 

 "If you're offering me a job, I'll take it," Valarie blurted out, already forgetting about Roy's betrayal or how that played into the job offer. 

 "Well, I appreciate that, but I think there's more to it that you need to know first," Travers said. "This job will pay you no money." 

 "No money?" Valarie said, feeling hurt and cheated and like she had wasted valuable time. "I can't do an internship, Mr. Travers. I have to make money." 

 "What exactly do you need money for?" he asked calmly. 

 "Well, rent, food, a car, bills, clothes," Valarie said. 

 "What if you didn't have to pay a cent for any of those things?" 

 "What are you saying?" Valarie asked. 

 "I'm saying, we are offering you a job here that will pay nothing in cash, but will cover all your expenses," Travers said. "Not only that, but your lifestyle will improve significantly. Fine dining, plush accommodations, trips to exotic locations, designer clothing." 

 "You'll pay for all that if I work here?" Valarie said. "But, I'll still need some cash, won't I?" 

 "What for?" Travers said. "All your costs will be covered" 

 "OK," Valarie said slowly. "Why can't you guys just pay me in money?" 

 "Because too much money might give you ideas about leaving, and we want a commitment from you, since we're taking a pretty big risk and taking on a lot personal expense. You see, the trade we're offering isn't about money and it isn't about jobs, it's about lifestyle. We're offering you a first-class lifestyle. Us, well, we like to live a life where we work hard and play hard. It's hard to find time for relationships. Sometimes, you don't want a relationship, you just want a pretty young woman on your arm when you go to dinner and on your cock when you get home. 

 "Oh my god," Valarie gasped. "You all want me to be some sort of call girl for you?" 

 "Something like that, but I would prefer to call you a 'Personal Assistant'," Travers said matter-of-factly. 

 "Where would I live?" Valarie frowned, hardly believing she was considering this. 

 "With us," Travers said. "We all have very nice homes. You will alternate between the three of us, living at a different place each day. That works out to twice a week for each of us, plus one day left over, which will be your day of rest. That day, you'll get to stay in your own place – perhaps a nice hotel – by yourself." 

 "And you'll have a car, clothes and eat at nice restaurants with us," Roy interjected. 

 "And what do I have to do for you?" Valarie asked. 

 "Well, there would be limits, of course," Travers said. "Nothing rough or violent or anything like that. But, within the realm of what you would consider normal sexual activity, you would be required to do whatever we want, whenever we want." 

 "What made you think I would even consider this?" Valarie asked, still angry and confused. "Just because I gave my landlord a blowjob doesn't mean I'm willing to do anything just for a place to live. I'm not a whore." 

 "Of course not," Travers said calmly. "We don't think you are at all. On the contrary, we think you are quite bright and charming and we really admire your strong character. It took guts to move here on your own with little more than the clothes on your back. It took guts to give your landlord a blowjob, too. We know you didn't like it and weren't trying to be a whore. We know you have class and style." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said. "But if I'm so great, then why do I have to do all this?" 

 "Because we also know you're desperate and don't have a lot of options," Travers said, his honesty stunning to Valarie. "You're a beautiful young woman, which means you have something we want. And we can offer you everything you don't have – job experience, a place to live, a car, clothes, food and safety." 

 "Safety?" Valarie scoffed. 

 "Yes, safety," Travers said. "As you've already scene, America can be a dangerous place for a young woman with no assets other than her body. But with us, you will not be harmed or degraded. You will be expected to be eye candy and a source for stress relief in the office and an invaluable distraction from work away from it. But always, you will be safe." 

 "And you said job experience? How will this help me in my career?" Valarie asked. 

 "Well, let me start by explaining that it will not be sex all day long here in the office," Travers said. "We work very hard here for long hours. Our days are busy and intense. I would say 90 percent of your day here will be performing actual legal work – filing, answering calls, preparing documents, managing our databases and our billing. We get paid based on billable hours, and I can't bill for my time while you're sucking my cock. So, any sexual activity will be a short, sweet stress relief. Now, that doesn't mean we won't expect you to dress up as some nice eye candy for us. The vast majority of our clients are men. They come by infrequently, but when they do, they will appreciate a pretty face as well. 

 "Now, where your responsibilities would change a little bit would be when we're on trips, such as the conference Roy just attended. If you were to accompany him, obviously a good portion of your day and night would be spent performing other duties." 

 "But I still don't see how this helps me with a career," Valarie said. 

 "We are a small but very powerful firm," Travers said. "I assure you that a year of experience from Travers and Nelson will serve you well. I can guarantee it will be the extra piece you need to get into law school. We also have many contacts who will be impressed and ready to hire such a well-trained young woman at an entry-level position." 

 "Did you say a year?" Valarie asked. 

 "Yes, one year," Travers said. "That will give you time to learn and us time to get to know you very well. After a year, we'll see what happens. Who knows, you might want to stay." 

 "No way," Valarie said. 

 "Don't be so sure," Travers said softly. "Certain lifestyles can be very addictive. It would be hard for you to go back to a tiny, dirty apartment, living paycheck to paycheck after a year of living like we do. Trust me, you will have a great time." 

 Valarie looked at them each, right in their eyes, looking for some signs of a joke or deceit or malance. Nothing but honest, handsome, friendly eyes returned her gaze. 

 "I don't get it," she said. "You are all attractive, extremely successful men. Why do you need me? I'm sure you have no problem getting women." 

 "True, we can get women," Nelson spoke up for the first time. "But as you know, there is a great time demand on us here. It's a high-level, high-stress job. A lot of times, women want us to be home more or do more things with them. They want more of our time. Or they only want our money. Bill and I are both divorced and Roy, well, he plays the field pretty well. But there are lot of games and lot of strings and a lot of times all you really want is a nice dinner companion and some good sex. No complications. You want to work in law, so you understand the time involved and we're all being open about the money, so there are no squabbles there. This gives us what we want in a very convenient and extremely attractive package." 

 "You don't want to fall in love, get married again?" 

 "Not really. I love work, sports and sailing," Nelson said. "Add a hot young babe to the mix and I'm a happy camper." 

 Valarie didn't know what to say. She didn't know what to do. She was stunned by their offer and their frank comments. She had no doubt they were very honest about what they were proposing. But still, could she really trust them? And could she go from being sweet Valarie to a slutty Valarie? 

 "I'm sure you have a lot to think about," Travers said. "How about we do this: Roy is going to take you to a very nice hotel. We have a lot of out-of-town clients and we have an agreement with a 5-star hotel downtown. You'll have a room there tonight. Feel free to order room service, enjoy the spa, have a drink at the bar – it will all be charged to your room. We will not question your expenses. Think it over tonight, and if you're interested, come back tomorrow and we'll have a formal interview." 

 "Interview? I thought you were already offering me the job." 

 "Well, essentially we are," Travers said. "But no one is hired without an interview, background check and drug test. Plus, I want to learn more about your legal skills and your sexual experience and opinions. Come prepared with a list of questions you have for us as well. Consider this a partnership where we all have an equal stake. I don't take lightly the sacrifices we are asking you to make, but please don't take lightly what we are risking and what we are offering. It is substantial on both sides." 

 "OK," Valarie said. "If I come back, what time should I be here?" 

 "Call Roy by 8:30 and he'll pick you up," Travers said. "And think about the position and job requirements we have talked about. Your attire will demonstrate to us much of your understanding of what we are asking of you." 

 With that, they all shook her hand and Roy took her to the hotel. In the car, she asked him why he had told them about the incident with the landlord and he said he thought it showed her mental toughness and resolve. 

 "This job will require you to be strong mentally," Roy said. "There will be a lot of demands on you, both at work and away from it. Your actions coming here and dealing with the landlord and living with almost nothing impressed everyone. Nelson and Travers have high standards for women. They wouldn't settle for any common slut or whore. They don't see you that way. Understand?" 

 "But they want to use me that way, right?" Valarie demanded. 

 "In a way, I suppose. But it's all in how you look at it. You will be well taken care of, wined and dined. Taken on trips, given a car. It's not like anyone's going to beat you up or slap you around. And you said yourself, we're all attractive. I hate to sound arrogant, but there are a lot of women who would probably jump at this opportunity. You were chosen because we all think you're special." 

 Valarie didn't know whether to believe him or not, but she thanked him anyway. 

 Roy dropped her off at the hotel. It was the most luxurious hotel she had ever seen. It only got better when she realized they were putting her up in a penthouse suite. She couldn't imagine how much it cost. 

 "I'm going to go to your apartment and pack your things and bring them here," Roy said. "I don't want you going back there ever again. And don't worry about the couch. Even if you decide not to take the job offer, I will get you a new one." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said. "I think I might lie down and take a nap, if you don't mind. This has all been a lot to take." 

 "No problem," Roy said. 

 Valarie drank a bottle of water from the mini bar, then stripped down to her panties and lay in the huge king-sized bed. The sheets felt so soft and clean against her skin. She had never laid in such luxury. She peeled off her panties and let the soft sheets caress her naked body and send her into a deep sleep. She awoke to the sound of someone in the other room and bolted up in bed. 

 "Hey, just me," Roy called. "Brought your stuff back." He poked his head in the bedroom and Valarie quickly jerked the sheet up over her bare breasts, but failed to cover the bare thigh that was uncovered on the side of the bed closest to him. His eyes flashed to her long, toned leg. "Have a good nap?" he asked. 

 "Yes," she said. "Thank you. I, uh, could you give me a minute, please?" 

 "Of course," Roy said. Then he bent over and picked up her panties, holding them up by one finger, admiring how tiny and soft they were. "Need these?" he smiled. 

 "Um, yeah, thanks," Valarie said, blushing. 

 "I'll be out here," Roy said. "Take your time." 

 Valarie dressed quickly and joined Roy in the other room, happy to see all her things, including her clothes and computer. "I talked to Bill and if you decide to accept the offer, you can just keep everything here," Roy said. "This will become your permanent place. Even though you'd only stay here once a week, you could keep all your things here." 

 "They won't rent out the room to anyone else?" 

 "We have a very good deal with this hotel," Roy said. "The only guests staying here would be our guests and we would know in advance so we could remove anything you didn't want to leave behind. There's a storage closet on the other side of the bathroom that can only be opened with a separate key. You can put all your things in there when you need to." 

 "This would be my place?" Valarie said, hardly able to believe it. Just this morning she was in a dingy apartment that she could barely afford. Now she could move up to something like this? It was overwhelming. 

 "Yes," Roy said. "Like Bill said, nothing but first-class all the way. Something to think about, isn't it?" 

 "It sure is," Valarie said. 

 "I better go," Roy said. "You think about everything. Call me by 8:30 if you want to come for the interview. And don't forget to think about how you dress." 

 "Any suggestions?" 

 "You'll figure it out," Roy smiled. He left and Valarie slowly began unpacking her things, studying each item of clothing, trying to think what she should wear. It was then that she realized what she was thinking about. Had she already made up her mind that she was doing this? For a whole year? She pictured each of them, all handsome and professional. They were so confident, but not cocky. Just in control and powerful. Very sexy indeed. Then she thought about the landlord. She thought about her old apartment versus this luxurious room. She thought about her old job running a cash register versus a job with a prestigious law firm. She thought about riding the bus versus driving her own car. She thought about scratching enough money for some crackers and macaroni and cheese versus dining at the finest restaurants in town. She thought about watching DVDs on her computer versus seeing Broadway-style plays and concerts. She thought about not taking the offer versus taking it. The choice was clear. 

 She began looking in earnest through her clothes, debating what to wear for her interview. She wanted to impress them with the class and professionalism they said they admired, but also wanted to show them that she understood that looking sexy was a major part of the job. Slutty and classy in the same outfit was a tough look to pull off. Finally, after trying several outfits and modifying some, she settled on one. 

 She hadn't eaten all day and ordered a large meal from room service for dinner. She was surprised at how comfortable she was with her decision. She felt relief and excitement, but not fear or angst. Valarie had great instincts, and her instincts told her this was right. 

 After dinner, she took a long bubble bath in a tub that many people would consider a swimming pool. It was huge! She added some bath oil to the water and came out with her skin feeling soft and sleek. All the talk about sex and now the realization that she was about to turn her body over to three handsome men who would share her for the next year had her very aroused. She was excited, happy and felt warm all over. 

 She thought about turning on her computer and finding a story about a nice girl who turns into a hot little slut in the hands of the right men, who help her understand and explore and use her sexuality. Those were the stories she liked. She identified most with the girls who were basically sweet and nice and innocent, but found that inner slutty, naughty side and learned to be a little of both. She stopped short of turning on the computer, though, when she realized that she was about to become that girl in real life. She didn't need fiction and fantasy. Her reality was about to beat those hands down.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 01 ****** bydlsloan© She slipped on a silky pink see-through nighty that hung down to her hips. It came with a matching thong, and she put this on too. She lay in bed and rubbed and cupped her breasts through the silky material, She dipped her fingers inside her thong and stroked her pussy lips, then pulled the soft material between her lips and used it to rub her clit. She pictured her new men – Travers, Nelson and Roy. She thought first about Roy's boyish good looks and broad smile. He was tall and she pictured him with firm abs and a strong cock. She thought about Travers, the well-groomed, handsome gentleman who knew what he wanted and took it. She had no doubt he'd tell her what to do, how to do it and why should she be enjoying it. Then she thought about Nelson. The man was a god. So handsome, so strong. She just knew he had a rock-hard chest and solid biceps. She had to admit that having sex with any of these men seemed like it would be fun. 

 Then she thought about them using her, showing her off in public, dressing her in sexy dresses and taking her to dinners and shows. She thought about them sitting at their desks while she crouched below them and serviced them. She thought about them taking her two at a time. Maybe even three! They wouldn't dare, would they? Her pussy was so wet now, her nipples hard. She squeezed her breasts and rubbed her clit in little circles. She pressed the soft sheets against her body and rubbed them between her thighs. She curled her toes and stretched her legs, opening them wider and wider. She thought about them taking her like this, legs spread wide, pussy wet, nipples hard, and taking turns, fucking her all night long, one after the other. 

 Her imagination was running wild now and so were her juices. She was so hot, so horny. Her fingers were working fast now, touching herself in just the right spots and just the right way. She stroked her self and teased herself with gentle pinches. She came with a single muted cry, "Oooh!" her body tensing, then slowly relaxing in a state of sheer ecstasy. 

 Even though it was midnight, she picked up the phone and called Roy. "Come get me in the morning," she said. She swore she could here him smiling through the phone. Little did he know that she was smiling too.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 02 ****** bydlsloan© Chapter Two: Learning the ropes 

 The next morning, Valarie awoke still excited and happy about her decision, though a little nervous now that it was about to become reality. She wondered how long they would wait before they had sex with her, then laughed at herself. They wouldn't wait. It was only a matter of hours before they would make her their slut for the first time. It was a little scary, but she was looking forward to it all the same. They had instilled so much trust in her, made her feel so good about herself, both in terms of her looks and her personality, she was confident and ready to prove to them she was every bit as good as they thought she was. She didn't want to let them down. How weird was that? 

 She got dressed in the outfit she thought would show them she knew exactly what they wanted from her. It was a little red cocktail dress she had worn a few times on special dates with Sebastian and he had always liked it. She picked it because she thought the red showed passion and strength and confidence and everything else about the dress said sexy and feminine. It was completely backless, so she wore no bra, of course. It looped around her neck and dropped over her breasts in two separate red panels that reconnected just above her belly button. It was purposely a tight fit to prevent her breasts from falling out, but there was a good view of her cleavage and her bare abs. She had always received compliments on her back -- and her ass, too, of course -- and thought they would appreciate that view as well. 

 Since the dress fit snugly, it hugged her hips and ass, showing off her curves. Her back was bare to just above her ass and the black g-string she wore under the dress just barely peeked out over the top edge of the dress. The bottom of the dress stopped about three inches past the bottom of her ass cheeks, so she was showing lots of her long, sexy legs and could show her ass and even her pussy simply by bending over. She wore four-inch black stiletto heels - - halfway between classy and stripper, she thought. She knew her legs looked great in heels like this, and the mini dress helped show them off perfectly. She wore no jewelry and very little makeup. She kept her dark, soft hair down. She looked in the mirror, pleased with what she saw. She saw sexy and suggestive, but not trashy. She saw a confident woman in a dress that would be acceptable at a dinner party or nice club. A little classy, a little slutty, very confident. She hoped she was sending the right message. 

 Roy met her in the lobby right at 8:30 and the heads turning in the lobby as his eyes popped out of his head and jaw dropped told him that she had made a good first impression. She smiled and said coyly, "What? Isn't this appropriate lawyer attire?" 

 "It sure is appropriate," Roy nodded. "Come on before you cause a heart attack." 

 Valarie climbed into his SUV, making no effort to keep her short dress from riding up. She studied the list of questions she had prepared while Roy drove. She noticed that he kept glancing over at her. She could feel his eyes on her legs and her breasts. Soon enough, he'd be doing a lot more than looking, she reminded herself. She felt hot and turned the air up. Her nipples were hard and her pussy was beginning to smolder. She closed her notebook and looked at Roy, studying his handsome face and strong arms. She glanced down at his lap, wondering how big he was. 

 Roy escorted her into the office and they found Nelson and Travers waiting for them in the board room with its handsome leather chairs and mahogany table. First-class all the way, Valarie thought to herself. 

 Roy pulled her chair out for her and she sat down, placing her leather-bound notebook in front of her on the desk. She sat up straight, hands on top of her notebook. 

 "I'm glad you decided to take this next -- and last step -- in considering our proposed partnership," Travers said. "And I think we all agree that you absolutely nailed the look we had in mind. Absolutely stunning, yet tasteful." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said. 

 "May I ask what you are wearing underneath the dress?" Travers asked. 

 Valarie sensed there was more to this question than he was stating. She had woken up early and played out the interview in her head. She kept telling herself that she should be flattered, that they found her special, unique. They had been unbelievably direct and honest and generous. They had treated her with respect. She felt it was important to repay them at least that much today. Be direct, honest and show them the boldness and passion that had impressed them initially. Be bold, she told herself. 

 "Of course you may, sir," she said. "I am wearing no bra, of course, and yes, this dress does feel good on my nipples, which are a little hard right now. I'm also wearing a black g-string, which I would be happy to show you for your inspection." 

 "Please do," Travers said, clearly pleased by her answer. It was clear that she had a very good understanding of what they were proposing and had given it a lot of thought. Travers suspected she had already made up her mind. 

 Valarie stood up and hiked up her dress, showing them the tiny patch of silk black material covering her pussy mound. Then, she slowly turned around and gave them the rear view, first standing up straight, then bending at the waist and putting her hands on the arms of her chair. Her pussy felt hot and moist and she wondered if her pussy lips were glistening for them. She sort of hoped they were. 

 "Very nice," Travers said. "You have done well. You may be seated." 

 Valarie sat back down, resuming her straight posture and hands in front of her. "If I may say something, gentlemen," she said, "I thought a lot about our conversation yesterday. I'll admit I was overwhelmed and shocked at first, but gradually I realized that you were all treating me with more respect and honesty than I would have ever imagined. I know you have more questions today and I just want to let you know that I will answer anything" -- she stressed this word and let it linger as she looked at them all with her sparkling eyes that shone with just a hint of naughtiness -- "that you ask me with the same level of honesty and directness. I don't know if this will work out or not, but I want you to know that I trust you and that you can trust me. Whatever we discuss today will never leave this room. I had a wonderful evening last night and I can't thank you enough for the first-class treatment." 

 All three men were dressed in tailored suits, though they had all removed their jackets. They looked so charming and handsome and professional, Valarie was getting drunk with the idea of submitting herself to these distinguished and powerful men. 

 "Very well said, my dear," Nelson said. "I'm glad we didn't scare you off yesterday. I assure you that nothing you say or do will leave this room either. We are not interested in embarrassing you in any way. If you elect to reject our offer, that will be the end of it. And if you accept, all actions from right now forward will be entirely confidential." 

 "I appreciate that very much, sir," Valarie said. 

 The men began by asking her about her academic background and were impressed with her scores, particularly in her pre-law curriculum. She had several letters of recommendation from her professors and an impeccable list of references. 

 "Very impressive," Travers said. "I would think you could get into law school with these qualifications." 

 "I haven't tried," Valarie said. "I can't afford it. I came to the States hoping to get a job where I could make a little money and gain enough experience to perhaps earn a scholarship. I thought actually living here might help my chances." 

 "Sound logic," Travers said. "Well, I can assure you we will do all we can to help you earn a scholarship if that is what you elect to do a year from now. Now, we have some very personal questions to ask you, sexual in nature as I'm sure you anticipated." 

 "Yes, sir," Valarie smiled. "You can ask me anything you like." 

 "All right," Roy said, "can you please tell us why Sebastian used to call you Sweetie?" 

 "Of course," Valarie said, aware that she was blushing now. She felt her pussy growing hotter and she felt tingly all over. "I always tell people that it's because I'm so nice, but really it's because he said my pussy was the sweetest thing he'd ever tasted." 

 Roy's smile told Valarie that he had already known the answer -- Sebastian obviously had talked about her to him -- and that she had passed another test by answering truthfully. 

 "I wouldn't mind finding out myself," Roy said. 

 "Of course, sir," Valarie said, starting to stand up, but Travers stopped her. 

 "Wait," he said. "We have more questions to ask. Then, if we're all in agreement about moving forward, we can have some fun. But we're wasting valuable time that we cannot bill, so let's move on. Valarie, when is the last time you had sex?" 

 Valarie thought a moment and realized it had been over a month ago, with Sebastian, the day before they broke up. 

 "Other than the landlord, of course," Valarie said, "the last time was a little over a month ago with my ex-boyfriend Sebastian. We had sex in my apartment, two times that night. The first time I sucked his cock until he was hard, and then he fucked my pussy doggy style. The second time I was on top." 

 "Did you cum either time?" Nelson asked. 

 "The second time, not the first," Valarie said. 

 "Do you masturbate?" Travers asked. 

 "Yes," Valarie said. "I like to touch myself sometimes." 

 "Do you use toys?" 

 "No, I prefer my hands," Valarie said. "I take my time, do a lot of rubbing and stroking." 

 "When was the last time you masturbated and what did you think about?" Nelson asked. 

 "Last night," Valarie said. "I lay in bed and touched myself all over. I thought about the three of you. I imagined you were taking turns with me. I came very hard. I'm afraid I might have stained those lovely sheets." 

 Valarie couldn't believe how open she was being with them, or how natural it felt. It made her feel good and open and horny -- anything but ashamed or nervous or guilty. She realized how difficult it was for men and women to speak to one another so frankly about sex and how wonderful it was to be able to do so with men she was attracted to and trusted implicitly. 

 "Tell my what you think about cum," Travers said. "Do you like the taste? The feel on your skin? Do you like to swallow it?" 

 Valarie knew they would probably like to hear that she loved and it swallowed it every chance she got. But this wasn't about telling them what they wanted to hear -- it was about telling the truth. 

 "I love to make a man cum," Valarie said. "It's powerful for me, knowing that I have that little bit of impact on him, that control on him. I love watching it shoot out or feeling a hard cock pulse inside me while it's shooting cum. I like the way it feels on my skin at first -- so hot and thick, but it starts feeling rather nasty after a few minutes when it starts to cool down and gets dry and sticky. I have never swallowed before, until the landlord forced me to. I don't much care for the taste, but I don't hate it. I have no problem having a man cum in my mouth, but I'm not going to say it's yummy." 

 "And we don't want you to," Travers said. "I feel safe in speaking for all of us that we don't want you to fake anything. Don't fake an orgasm, don't pretend that you love the taste of my cock or my cum, don't act like you can't wait to be fucked when you're not really in the mood. We want you to be as brutally honest as you are right now. I want to know when you're having an orgasm that it's real. I want to know when you whisper in my ear that you need my cock that you mean it. That's what is hot. That doesn't mean we won't fuck you at times when you're not in the mood or we'll avoid cumming in your mouth. There will be times you will do things you don't want to do. That's just how this works, but all jobs are like that." 

 "Of course," Valarie said. "I understand completely. I will not lie to you or be fake." 

 "Now, that said, I do know women who have said that cum is an acquired taste," Travers grinned. "Sort of like beer or coffee -- most people don't care for it much the first few times they have it, but after awhile, they develop a taste for it. Sometimes even an addiction." 

 "If I do, I'll let you know," Valarie giggled. "Of course, I guess if I'm addicted it will be obvious, with me diving between your legs all the time to get my fix." 

 They all laughed as the tension continued to lighten in the room. The men asked about her history, how many guys she'd had sex with, when she lost her virginity, if she'd ever been with more than one man at a time, if she'd ever been with a woman. Valarie answered it all. 

 "How about anal sex?" Roy asked. 

 "I've had it," Valarie said. "It's not my favorite way to do it, but I tolerate it and would never deny you that if that's what you desired." 

 "Damn, she answers every question perfectly," Roy said. 

 "Yes, I think she's answered enough," Travers said. "Do you have questions for us, my dear?" 

 "Yes," Valarie said, opening her notebook. "You've answered most of them already, either directly or indirectly through the questions you've asked me. But I do have a few." 

 She asked them about bondage and public sex and group sex and dirty talk. She learned that they would expect her to submit to light bondage and that she would be shown off publicly -- and perhaps fucked -- if they so desired. They admitted the possibility of group sex and sex with select clients. 

 "As far as dirty talk," Nelson said. "I have to admit that I enjoy using words like slut and whore and bitch at times. I wouldn't use them in daily activity, but they are arousing during sex sometimes and I do like to talk that way. I hope you won't take it personally, because it is not meant that way." 

 "I understand," Valarie said. "It seems like men work more off of visual and verbal stimulus than women do. I have no problem with whatever you want to call me in those situations and I will try to encourage you by using the same sort of terms, like 'make me your little cum slut.'" 

 "Yes, say that!" Roy said a little too excitedly. Travers stern look told him to calm down and be a professional. 

 Valarie was out of questions, which was good, because all this talk and anticipation had made her horny and edgy and anxious with anticipation. She was sure when she got up there would be a wet mark in the seat. She squirmed as Travers made the final proposal and presented the proposed schedule. 

 "You will stay with Roy on Fridays, Nelson on Saturdays and me on Sundays," he said. "Monday will be your off day, then you'll be with Roy on Tuesdays, Nelson on Wednesdays and me on Thursdays." 

 "OK," Valarie said, shaking now, goosebumps on her arm. Every nerve in her body was on full alert. Whenever someone got around to fucking her, she was either going to pass out or have the biggest orgasm of her life -- or both. 

 "Here is a purchase card which you can use for clothes as I'm sure you realize you will need to upgrade your wardrobe to meet the demands of this position. Tomorrow, Nelson will take you shopping and Sunday we will get your car. Any questions?" 

 "When do I start?" Valarie said, squirming. 

 "Right now," Travers said. 

 Valarie's heart skipped a beat, thinking the moment had finally come. They were going to fuck her right here, right now. 

 "We have a lot of work to do," Travers said. "We've lost a lot of time today. Roy, please get Ms. Evans set up on her computer and show her what she needs to do." 

 Valarie couldn't believe it. After all that, they weren't going to fuck her? What kind of men were these? How was it possible that she wanted them more than they wanted her? It was so frustrating. She wanted to touch herself, but took a deep breath and reminded herself that she had to be classy, professional, under control. She didn't know how they could do it, but she would have to do it too. 

 

 Roy set her up with some filing and account maintenance and she worked diligently, focusing as best she could on her tasks. But all the while, she knew eyes were on her. Even as the men worked, she knew they saw her bending over to file papers, watched her long legs stride confidently across the room, strained for peeks inside her tight dress. She knew they had to at least be thinking about fucking her. They were just showing incredible control -- far more than she ever gave men credit for. 

 Finally, early in the afternoon, Travers called her in his office and told her to close the door. This, at long last, was it. 

 "I need a little stress relief," he said. "Normally, I'm not the slam-bam-thank you ma'am type, but I don't have time for much else right now. So, come here." 

 He took her in his strong arms and pulled the red panels over her breasts to the side so that they squished her tits together. He cupped her tits firmly, but not too hard, and rubbed her nipples between his fingertips. Valarie arched her back and thrust her chest toward him, encouraging him to grab and play all he wanted. 

 He pulled her onto his lap and pulled her dress up around her waist. He cupped her pussy, then put his hand inside the g-string pouch covering her mound. He felt her moist, hot lips and whispered, "You were ready. Very good, my little slut." 

 "I'm always ready for you," she said softly in his ear. 

 He tore her g-string aside and she heard it tear. She didn't care. He stood her up while he pulled out his cock, then dragged her back into his lap. She spread her legs and opened herself to him. His rigid cock stood up firm and strong and soon found its way between her smoldering pussy lips, their velvety softness pulling him in, his cock drawn to the heat of her pussy like a sunflower straining for the sun's warming rays. 

 She slid her hips and took him fully inside her. She leaned forward and nuzzled against his neck, then sat up straight and put her breasts in his face. He grabbed her ass cheeks and urged her up and down on his cock, his hands dictating the pace, which started slow but picked up fast. Valarie wanted to fuck him hard and cum all over his cock, but she could tell he wasn't going to last long, nor was he trying to. This man had a plan for everything, she realized, even fucking. 

 He was good at it, too. His tongue and lips were making her breasts sing with pleasure and his hard cock was a welcome improvement over her own talented but admittedly far less exciting fingers. She rubbed her hands over his chest, working them inside his shirt, feeling his hairy chest and muscular arms. Very impressive for his age. So was his cock, which was very hard now, filling her welcoming pussy with its thick, veiny shaft. Valarie humped harder. "Ride me hard, slut," Travers said through gritted teeth. He pushed her down hard on his cock and held her place as his cock spasmed and began shooting thick wads of cum deep inside her. Valarie moaned and rocked her hips, using her pussy to milk him dry. Slowly she slid off and stepped back. 

 "Excellent work," Travers said. "You may clean up in my bathroom over there." 

 "Thank you, sir," Valarie said. She scurried to the bathroom and cleaned off and re-positioned everything. Her g-string was indeed torn, so she took it off and threw it in the garbage. She was sure there would be no complaints. 

 Her first time with Travers had been great, but too short. She wanted more. She wanted to cum. She was so horny now. Her pussy begged for her fingers, but she knew she would be expected to get back to work promptly. She only hoped that Nelson or Roy would take a turn soon. She knew Roy would probably get her off tonight -- how fun it was going to be to spend the night with him! -- but she needed relief now. She couldn't possibly focus on work. But when she returned to her desk, both men were busy.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 02 ****** bydlsloan© Disappointed, she sat down and checked her email. A note from Nelson: "My office, blowjob, now." She looked at his office. He was on the phone and busily writing something. She hurried over and peeked in the door. He looked at her and pushed his chair back, motioning to her to come over. She closed the door and went to him, dropping to her knees. He was still on the phone, involved in what seemed to be a very important conversation. Valarie knew that wasn't her concern right now. Neither was the needs of her own pussy. Her only responsibility, her only priority, was to suck his cock. Oddly, she discovered that she couldn't wait. She had masturbated last night envisioning Nelson's cock. Now, she could finally see it, touch it, taste it. She tugged at his trousers and pulled his cock out. It was semi-hard, but as soon as she touched her tongue to it, he grew fully erect. 

 Valarie stroked his shaft with her soft hands while she licked the head of his cock, then gently took it into her mouth. She looked up at him for signs of approval, but he was fully into his phone call, actually taking notes. Talk about multi-tasking, she thought. She went about half way down his shaft and started bobbing her head up and down slowly, using her tongue to coat the underside of his cock and tease the underside of his head, which she knew was extremely sensitive. 

 Nelson was a strong, muscular man, obviously in great shape and one of those guys who had natural good looks and a powerful manliness any woman would find attractive. Valarie was not surprised that this handsome man had a handsome cock too. It was above average in size -- at least in her experience -- but not some monstrosity that was more freakish than sexy. If the average cock was 5- 6 inches, she guessed his was about 7 and a little thicker than most. It was also so firm, so rigid, just having it in her mouth was exciting. She couldn't imagine how good it would feel in her pussy. 

 She wanted to reach between her legs, but she knew this was about him, not her and kept one hand on his balls and the other on the base of his cock. She kept looking up to see if he was watching, but he seemed almost oblivious to her presence, other than the fact that his cock was hard and obviously responding to her efforts. Had he been with so many beautiful women, received so many blowjobs that this was ordinary to him? She hoped she was pleasing him, but she wasn't sure now. She wondered how she stacked up against the other experiences he had. It struck her that she needed to perform well or they might fire her. How awful and ironic would that be? She sucked hard, hoping that's what he wanted. 

 Suddenly, she felt his hand on the back of her head and she looked up. He was now looking at his computer screen, still talking to his client. But his cock was talking to her and said volumes with a gushing rush of jism that splattered against her tongue and cheeks and rushed wildly for the back of her throat. With his hand still on her head, she knew she needed to swallow and she did. His cum was bitter and salty, but not altogether unpleasant. She didn't see how she'd ever develop an appreciation for it, much less an addiction, but there was a certain pride and pleasure in bringing such a man to that point and then accepting his cum so willingly and unselfishly. Her pussy was warm and moist and she felt naughty and horny and anxious for more fun. 

 She went back to her desk and tried to focus on work, but her body was telling her that other things were more important right now. She wanted to fuck and cum so badly and she felt so naughty and free. About 20 minutes later, Nelson called her back into his office. So soon, she thought. She thought they were supposed to take it easy at work, but obviously he was a very virile man who would demand much of her attention. At least she hoped so. 

 "Valarie, have a seat," he said. "First, I want to thank you. That felt terrific." 

 "Thank you," she said, blushing and proud that she had pleased him. 

 "Now, you did well, so I don't want you to take this as criticism, just tips for how to get better," Nelson said. "If I had to grade you, that was a solid B. Very good work. Your enthusiasm was great, your tongue felt fantastic and you swallowed like a pro." 

 "But..." Valarie said warily. 

 "But, there are some things you can do better and I'm sure, given your drive and impressive academic resume, want to do better than a B," Nelson said. 

 "Of course," Valarie said eagerly. "Please, tell me how I can be an A. I want to be the best at everything. Always have, even back when I played soccer. People said I was too competitive. I know I'm not the first girl to suck your cock, Mr. Nelson, but I want to be the best. Please tell me what to do." 

 "That's the perfect attitude," he said. "And you have all right skills, too, so I'm sure you'll be fantastic. One, more mouth, less hands. I want a blowjob, not a handjob, so gets your hands out of the way. Two, my cock is seven inches long, not five. I expect you to suck the whole thing. Three, your tongue and lips feel a lot better on my balls than even your soft little hands do. Don't forget to lick and suck them. Four, you use your tongue and lips well, but don't forget your cheeks. Stuff my cock in the side of them, let me see it poking out against the side of your mouth. Rub it on your face and in your hair." 

 "Yes sir," Valarie said. "I promise I'll do better next time. I'm sorry I disappointed you." 

 "You didn't disappoint me," Nelson said kindly. "You were better than most, I promise you. And you know I would tell you if you weren't. You'll have many opportunities to practice and get better and I'm sure you will." 

 "Thank you , sir," Valarie said, humbled but determined to be a better cocksucker. What was she thinking? Two days ago, she wanted to be a great lawyer, a great mom. Now, in such a short time, her focus had changed to being the world's best slut? And why didn't she feel worse about it? Something's wrong with me, she thought, but all she could think about was her smoldering pussy and how she needed some attention soon. 

 The end of the day finally came and Valarie realized that Roy had decided to wait for their full night together to try her out for the first time. She just hoped that he wanted to fuck her pussy and not a blowjob. She'd happily give him one later, but she wanted to cum first so badly. 

 "How about we go out for a nice dinner?" Roy asked as they left the office. 

 "That would be great," Valarie beamed. "Is what I'm wearing OK? I don't have any panties, you know." 

 "It's fine," Roy said. "In fact, if you had panties, I'd make you take them off." 

 When they got outside, Valarie started to head for Roy's SUV, but he held her back. "I might drink a bit tonight," he said, "so I took the liberty of ordering a car." He nodded to a sleek town car, where a driver dressed in a black suit waited for them, holding the back door open. 

 "Oh my," Valarie said, impressed. "How fun!" 

 Roy and the driver -- Williams -- watched Valarie slide into the back seat, her dress riding up and flashing generous amounts of ass cheek and upper thigh to their admiring eyes. Inside were wine glasses, a bottle of wine on ice and some strawberries. Roy served and sat close to her, pulling aside the top panels of her dress to reveal her bare tits. Roy had instructed Williams to keep the sliding dark panel between the front and rear seats down, and Valarie realized it was so he could show her off to the driver. She got wetter and wetter as she felt Roy stroke her nipples and saw Williams' eyes flashing back at her through the rearview mirror. 

 Valarie wondered if he would fuck her right here in the seat with Williams watching. She would have to wait to find out, however, as they reached the restaurant. Roy put the panels back over her breasts, squeezing them and pinching her nipples lightly to make sure they stayed hard and noticeable through her tight dress. He escorted her into the restaurant, which was elegant. Soft music was playing and the lights in the dining room were dim and romantic. All of the staff were dressed in suits and elegant dresses. Valarie felt like she was at a ball instead of a restaurant. 

 Roy had made reservations and escorted her to the table, pulling out the chair for her. She looked around, taking in the beauty of the place. It had white linens and golden chandeliers that sparkled in the dimly lit room. The waiter brought them their menus and took Roy's order of a bottle of wine. Valarie noticed the waiter glancing at her chest and tingled with excitement. Men were looking at her even more than usual, and certainly with more lust in their eyes. She was on display, after all, and her attire was sending a signal that she was inviting and expecting men to look at her in a certain way. How sexy was that? She squirmed in her seat, the anticipation of the night's events growing and growing. 

 The waiter brought out the wine and offered the cork for Roy to sniff. Valarie giggled as the waiter walked away and Roy asked her what was so funny. "I know you're supposed to sniff the cork, but it just seems silly to me. Can't they just let you taste it?" 

 "Not when it's this pure," Roy said. "This is premium wine. It's not to be sampled randomly. Plus, you can tell a lot by how it smells." 

 "I guess," Valarie smiled. 

 "Don't believe me?" Roy challenged, grinning. "OK, Sweetie. Sebastian says your pussy is the sweetest thing since chocolate. I can't hardly taste you right here, though, so how about we try a little experiment?" 

 "Sure," Valarie said, knowing no other answer would be acceptable. 

 Roy called the waiter over and asked him to wash the cork off and bring it back along with a piece of string. The waiter did, took their order and left, again glancing at Valarie's cleavage. 

 "OK," Roy said. "Put this in your pussy. We'll let the cork soak you up, then I'll smell and let you know what I think. Are you wet?" 

 "I have been all day," Valarie confessed. "May I go to the restroom?" 

 "Of course," Roy said, tying the string to the end of the cork. "Push it all the way in and we'll pull it out with this string." 

 Valarie stood up and walked slowly to the restroom, well aware that Roy and every other man in the place was watching her long legs, shown off so nicely by her heels and short dress. She imagined them trying to figure out what she had on underneath, if anything. She was so wet. She found a stall and easily slipped the cork inside, letting the short string hang out of her pussy. It was a thin string, so she hoped no one would notice, but it hung lower than her dress, so there was always that chance. 

 She returned to the table and together they waited 15 minutes before Roy instructed her to pull it out. Valarie looked around carefully, trying to see if anyone was watching or if the waiter was coming. But she knew better. Eyes had been on her non-stop since they got here. She had been "checked out" by plenty of men, but never leered at like this. She was the center of attention and it was much more of a turn on than she ever imagined. 

 As discreetly as she could, she slipped her hand between her thighs, found the little string and tugged gently, feeling the cork move. She shifted lower in the seat to give it a better angle and it slipped out of her tight pussy with a barely audible pop. She handed him the string and he touched the cork. "Ouch! That's hot!" he said, shaking his hand, pretending to be burned. Valarie giggled and blushed. "OK, maybe not that hot, but it is warm and wet. Let's see how it smells." 

 Roy held the cork to his nose and took a deep breath. He smiled and took another. "You smell," he said, putting the cork in front of her nose. She looked around, wondering if any of the leering eyes had figured out where that cork had been. She thought it smelled OK. Not disgusting, at least. 

 "You pass the smell test, that's for sure," Roy said. "If you taste like you smell, Sebastian might be right. But I'm going to need more proof, and I can't wait until later." 

 Valarie felt her pussy spasm and thought she was going to cum right there. He was going to taste her right now! But how? 

 "I like a good cigar after dinner," Roy said, holding up a thick brown cigar. "This is one of the finest Cuban cigars they make. Smells and tastes fantastic. I wonder, though, if it would smell and taste even better if it marinated inside you first." 

 "Oh my," Valarie said, understanding what he wanted. Without saying another word, she took the cigar and started for the restroom. Minutes later, she was back at the table, the cigar tucked neatly inside her, soaking up her luscious juices. 

 They talked about work and the city and her hometown as they dined. Valarie told him about how she loved cricket and soccer and particularly loved to play soccer. He told her he'd teach her about American favorites like football, baseball and basketball. Roy also told her the big news, which was that the guys shut down the office for one week every year to go on a staff retreat - - which happened to be on Travers' yacht. They sailed down the coast, stopping at different ports along the way. The retreat was only a week away. 

 "Normally," he admitted, "we dock someplace for the night, go to a club and each pick up a different woman. This year, however, we have decided to change things. You're going with us. And you'll be the only woman on board the whole week. Obviously, the rules will have to be suspended for that week and you'll get your day off at some other time or be compensated in some other way." 

 "I'm sure it will be fair," Valarie said, already excited about a week on a yacht, even if that did mean that she would be at the service of all three men during that time. She should have been apprehensive or ashamed, but she only felt excited. She knew the saying about men thinking with their penises. Well, right now her pussy was doing all the thinking and the only thought was to have an orgasm sooner rather than later. 

 When dinner was over, Roy escorted Valarie back to the car, the cigar still tucked inside her. Once they climbed in the backseat -- with the dividing window still down, Valarie noted -- he asked her to spread her legs. Valarie hiked her dress over her hips and spread her legs on the leather seat, knowing that Williams could see her pussy clearly in the rearview mirror. Roy reached between her legs and she felt his fingers enter her, grabbing the end of the cigar and slowly pulling it out. She moaned softly and Roy chuckled. "Feeling good, huh?" 

 "Mmm-hmm," Valarie sighed. Between her sexual arousal and the several glasses of wine, she was feeling fantastic. Her inhibitions were gone and she was ready to pop. 

 Roy handed the cigar to Williams, "What do you think?" 

 "Smells fantastic," Williams said. "You're a lucky man, sir." 

 "Thank you," Roy said. "Enjoy that cigar. I've got a different treat in mind for dessert." 

 Roy pushed Valarie back on the seat and bent over between her legs. "Only way to find out," he said deeply, looking up at her. Watching her eyes, he touched his tongue to her pussy and saw her eyes bulge and body jerk. She was on fire. Smiling, Roy kissed her pussy lips, tasting her juices, feeling the heat from her core. He stroked her thighs gently and kissed her pussy with a passion Valarie wouldn't have expected. 

 He puckered his lips on hers, sucking on them gently, then teased in between them with soft strokes of his tongue. Valarie glanced toward the front of the car and saw Williams watching through the rearview mirror as he puffed on the cigar that she knew was soaked with her juices. 

 She felt Roy's hands slide up her body, touching her belly, her sides, squeezing her breasts through her dress. He pulled the dress aside again and covered her bare breasts with his hands, her hard nipples press against his palms. 

 "You do have the best pussy I've ever tasted," he said softly, looking up at her. He stroked her pussy with two of his fingers, teasing the outsides of her pussy lips, then rubbing her clit in small, slow circles. He raised his fingers to her lips. "Here, taste." 

 Valarie licked his fingers, tasting her own juices. Normally, she would have been indifferent to the taste, but in her aroused state, she too thought she tasted like candy and savored the sweetness that coated his fingers. Her pussy kept churning out more of that sweet nectar and Roy kept lapping it up with his warm tongue. 

 "Should I make her cum?" Roy asked Williams. 

 "I don't think you can stop her now," Williams chuckled. 

 "I don't think so either," Roy laughed. He tasted her again, opening his mouth now. He closed his lips over hers and wiggled his tongue inside, like he was French kissing her pussy. She put her hands on the back of his head and wrapped her smooth thighs around him, her heels now braced against the roof of the car. 

 

 She thought about how she had wanted to cum all day and expected to have the hardest orgasm of her life or to pass out or both. It was both. She came in waves of pure pleasure that started from her pussy but went in all directions, down her legs, up to her breasts, down her arms and back. Her body was consumed by it, one orgasm after another. They all ran together and she lost count as she did, indeed, slip out consciousness. 

 She came to just a few minutes later as Roy and Williams were helping her out of the car. "What's going on?" she asked, slurring her speech, drunk on sex or wine or both. 

 "We're at my house," Roy said. "Relax, I'm going to carry you in." 

 Valarie threw her arms around his neck and wrapped her legs around his waist, kissing him deeply as they walked up Roy's long walkway. She looked over his shoulder and saw Williams pulling away as she nuzzled Roy's neck. 

 "Damn, I can't wait any more," Roy muttered. He sat down Valarie down on the walkway about 100 feet from his front door. Looking around, he saw no one. It was dark, but it was a nice night and many people were out walking. He decided he didn't care. He unzipped his pants and pulled his cock out. 

 "Oooh," Valarie said, appreciatively. 

 Roy picked her up and she wrapped herself around him again, then felt the head of his cock probing against her pussy lips. She shifted her hips and Roy dropped her onto his cock, plunging all the way in. She moaned loudly, forgetting where they were. 

 "Shh," Roy laughed. With his hands under her ass, he began lifting her up and down in rhythm with his steps as he made his way to the front door. His cock was rock hard and badly in need of the relief Valarie's pussy was made for. 

 He fucked her with hard, deep thrusts, then pinned her against the front door and jackhammered inside her. Her well-toned, nicely curved body fit perfectly against him, her breasts pressed against his chest, her moist pussy pleasuring his cock with intense heat and a snug fit. 

 Looking over her shoulder, she saw a couple walking their dog at the end of the driveway. She stuck up her hand in a feeble wave as they looked at her and Roy, locked in a passionate embrace directly under the light above his front door. Valarie didn't care. Roy had been fantastic to her ever since she got to the States. And tonight, he'd treated her to an amazing meal and pleasured her like no other in the back of the car. He could take her into the middle of the street and fuck her like a dog all night long if he wanted. He deserved it and she was determined to give him anything he wanted tonight. 

 She urged him on with her body, not rushing him to cum, but encouraging him to take her, to use her, to have his way with her flexible, firm, nearly perfect body. He nailed her hard against the door and shot his load deep inside her. She felt his cum spraying inside her pussy, his heat matching hers. She came again too, then slumped to the porch as he sat her down gently.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 02 ****** bydlsloan© "So, welcome to my house," he laughed, tucking his cock back into his pants. "Want to come in?" 

 "Gee, I don't know," Valarie laughed, panting on the concrete. "I'm not that kind of girl, you know." 

 "You're THE kind of girl," Roy said. "Come on. I'm not done with you yet." 

 "Ooh, is that a threat or a promise?" Valarie teased. 

 "Depends on how you look at it," Roy teased back. "But judging from your reactions so far, I'd say it's a promise." 

 "I hope so," Valarie said. 

 Roy ushered her inside and Valarie was impressed. It wasn't a mansion by any means, but certainly a very nice home for such a young man. It was large and neatly furnished. 

 "Before you ask, I had a decorator put this together and, yes, I have a maid who comes twice a week to clean," Roy said. "I'm a bachelor. I'm not this neat." 

 "It's a lovely home," Valarie said. He showed her around, his hand around her waist as they walked through the house, which had three bedrooms -- one of which he used as an office -- and a full basement which Roy had turned into a "man cave" with a flat screen TV, wet bar, pool table and workout room. The master bedroom was enormous with a king size bed, a love seat, a desk and office chair and a huge walk-in closet. 

 Valarie excused herself to use the restroom and when she came back, Roy was laying on the bed, naked, his cock hard in his hand. 

 "I know what you taste like," he said. "How 'bout you give me a little taste test, too?" 

 "I'd love to," Valarie said, suddenly thinking through all the things that Nelson had told her to be better at sucking cock. She climbed onto the bed and knelt between his legs. 'I want a blowjob, not a handjob', she heard Nelson telling her. To remind herself, she put her hands behind her back and used her tongue and lips to pull him into her mouth. 

 "Tastes yummy," she said, looking up at him. 'Use your cheeks and face, too,' Nelson's voice rang in her head. She stuffed Roy's cock into her cheek and looked up at him again, making sure he could see his cock stretching her face. He was watching and she could tell he was enjoying the view. 

 'Suck and lick my balls, too.' Nelson, again, in her head. She pulled off Roy's cock and took it in her hand to lift it up and dove underneath, flicking her tongue underneath his balls, feeling how heavy and dense they were. She sucked one in her mouth, being careful not to suck too hard or nip him with her teeth. She knew that would be painful. She let that one go and sucked on the other ball, coating his sack with saliva. His cock was resting on her face, along the side of her nose and between her eyes. 

 'Use your face,' Nelson had said. She rubbed Roy's cock all over her face and wrapped her silky black hair around his shaft. He liked that a lot. His cock jerked and she thought he might cum in her hair. 

 "Suck it, slut," Roy said gruffly, that lusty glaze in his eyes telling her that he was thinking and talking with his cock now. She didn't take it personally, being called slut. She was beginning to understand a little of what the guys meant. They could be perfect gentlemen all day long, but when it came time to fuck, they wanted to unleash their inner beast, so to speak. Kind of like they were asking her to do -- be classy and professional when appropriate, but slutty and sexy at other times. It was starting to make sense. 

 'I'm seven inches, not five. Suck the whole thing,' Nelson had said. She guessed Roy was closer to six inches, but the point was the same. She went down on him, slowly but steadily, not stopping until she had his whole cock in her mouth. He groaned in obvious appreciation and he put his hands on the side of her face. She sucked hard so he could feel her cheeks hollow around his shaft. She pulled up, her muscles fighting against her own suction until she finally pulled off his cock with a loud pop. The head of his cock glistened with spit and pre-cum. It was swollen and red and looked like a big lollipop. Valarie went back down on it, all the way again. This time, Roy didn't let her up. His hands stayed on the back of her head and he began thrusting his cock into her throat. Valarie relaxed and let him take over, letting him use her mouth and head any way he wanted. 

 She felt his first blast of cum hit the top of her mouth. Even though he let go of her head, she didn't pull back. Didn't think about spitting it out. She didn't swallow, either though. Instead, she caught all of his load in her mouth, sucking and licking until he was done. Then, she crawled up over his chest, cum dribbling down her chin onto her red dress. She looked him in the eye, opened her mouth and showed him what he had put there. Then, she closed her mouth and swallowed. Roy just nodded his approval. 

 Later, they were laying in bed, both naked, curled up against each other. 

 "Do you mind if I ask how I was, the blowjob, I mean?" she asked. 

 "Very good," Roy said. "You were very good. Why do you ask?" 

 She told him about Nelson's critique and advice. "I just know you guys have had lots of girls and lots more experience than I have and I know you have very high standards for what you want from me," she blurted out. "I'm just worried I won't be good enough." 

 "You're plenty good enough," Roy said. "Look, you obviously learned from what Nelson told you and you put it into practice extremely well. You're going to learn more as we go. But you have nothing to worry about. You're smart, so you learn fast and understand the relationship we have here. You're energetic and have a great attitude and you're in fantastic shape. You're so young and lively and fun to be around. Your eyes and smile light up the place." 

 "Am I pretty enough?" she asked. 

 "Of course you are," Roy said. "Now you're just being silly. You're gorgeous. Would we have picked you for this if you weren't?" 

 "But don't American men love huge breasts? Mine are average." 

 "Huge breasts are nice, sure," Roy said. "But it's overrated. Most men I know prefer a woman who is naturally beautiful, and that's hard to find these days. But you, there's nothing fake about you. You don't even wear much makeup. You don't need it. You're beautiful, your breasts are great and don't even get me started on your legs and ass. They are absolutely fantastic. You have nothing to worry about." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said, "I really needed to hear that. Do you have any other tips for me like Nelson did? Things I can do better?" 

 "Sure," Roy said. "Just a few things. I know this is new to you, but think more about how you're presenting yourself. Even when we're at work and we're all actually working, we still enjoy the eye candy. Do your job first, but if you're up making a copy, you could bend over to pick something up or grab your heel and stretch your legs, anything to show off a bit. Also, we love those hard little nipples, so if you're on the phone, maybe use your free hand to tweak them a bit, keep them hard and visible for us." 

 "Sure," Valarie said. "I didn't realize that was such a turn-on." 

 "Huge turn-on," Roy said. "Also, you'll get better at this, but start anticipating what we might want and take the initiative. For instance, in the restaurant, when you went to the restroom and all those men were staring at you, it would have been very hot for you to turn and blow me a kiss or maybe to have dropped the cork and bent over, things like that. Show off a little for me. I'm taking you there dressed like that to show you off. It's hot if you like it and do a little of the showing, too." 

 "I can do that," Valarie said. "I just have to start thinking that way. I'll try." 

 "It will become more natural, I think," Roy said. "Along the lines of anticipating, you can do things like ask permission to suck my cock instead of waiting for me to tell you." 

 "You mean, like when I came out of the bathroom and saw you laying here naked, I should have come over and said, 'sir, may I please suck your big, hard cock and swallow your yummy cum?'" Valarie teased in a sexy girly voice. 

 "Yes, that's exactly what you should have done," Roy said. "See, you're getting the hang of this already and it's only your first day." He kissed her on the cheek and they felt silent, drifting off to sleep. 

 Roy fucked her again in the morning, sitting Valarie on his cock and watching her ride him. Valarie didn't have to ask. She knew she was good at this. Her athletic body and finely tuned legs and ass moved fluidly while her pussy provided a sensual, slow massage of his cock. She had never been a stripper, but this was one pole dance she knew how to do with the best of them. As for cocksucking, dressing like a slut, showing off and, she was sure, ultimately being fucked in the ass, she knew she had more to learn from her trio of trainers, but she knew there would be no words of advice after this one. Roy was enjoying every second of it, his cock, strengthened by a night's rest, was even harder than it had been the night before and his stamina was impressive. Valarie fucked him long and slow, riding him, stroking his chest, feeling his strong arms and toned stomach. Roy reached up and played with her breasts, cupping them in his hands. Sometimes he pulled her down flat against him and squeezing her ass cheeks, occasionally giving them a playful slap. 

 Valarie loved the slow, steady pace and her pussy did too. It warmed up slowly this time, like a pot set to simmer. She got a little hotter, a little wetter, a little closer with each stroke of his cock inside her. She loved controlling where it went, how hard it pressed against her, how it moved inside her. When she got close, she put her head against his chest, held her breath and rocked her hips as fast as she could. He stayed motionless, his cock rock hard inside her as she came on top of him. 

 As soon as she was done, he rolled on top of her, hooked her knees over his shoulders and plowed into her, cumming seconds later. He pulled out and sprayed his jism on her smooth stomach. 

 When they were done, Valarie started to get up and go wash it off. "Wait a minute," Roy said. "Rule of thumb, the cum should always end up inside you." 

 "But you came on my stomach..." 

 "Right, but you can still eat it," Roy said. 

 "Oh," Valarie said, giggling. She scooped up the cum in her fingers and stuck them in her mouth while Roy continued the impromptu lesson. 

 "You always take it inside you -- mouth, ass or pussy -- and you always swallow if it's in your mouth," he said. "Now, sometimes, we like to see it on your body. If it's in a situation like this, you should know to go ahead and eat it without being told. Now, if we're in public or at work and I cum on your face or your blouse, there's a good chance I'll want you leave it there, at least for a while." 

 "Leave it there? But won't people be able to... oh," she said, understanding what he was saying. How naughty! She didn't know if she could do that. Wear cum in public? How embarrassing! Just when she thought she understood what was being expected of her in this deal, she realized that this was just the tip of the iceberg. 

 Roy sent her off in her little red dress with the telltale stain on the front from last night's activities. Nelson had sent a car to pick her up and take her back to her hotel, where she could shower and change clothes. An hour later, Nelson came to the hotel to pick her up. He had sent instructions for her to dress however she felt appropriate for an all-day shopping trip, reminding her that it would be wise to wear something that could be easily put on and removed to make it easier to try on clothes ... and do other things. 

 Valarie didn't have an assortment of what would be considered slutty clothes, so she did the best she could with what she had. Though she preferred soccer, she had played tennis a few times and had a little white tennis skirt that flared out nicely around her thighs. She wished it were shorter, but at the time she had bought it years ago, her intent hadn't been to turn on every man she saw. 

 She matched it with a canary yellow spandex tube top that, instead of needing to be slid over her head, could be simply removed via a zipper that ran right down the front, between her breasts. She wore no bra, so to expose her tits would take roughly two seconds. 

 Under the skirt she wore a pair of French cut yellow panties that tied in little bows on the side. To get out of her skirt and panties would take about 10 seconds. Finally, she wore a pair of four-inch black pumps with straps around each ankle. 

 "Very nice," Nelson said when he saw how she was dressed. "This is good and I'm sure you'll find many other great ideas when we're out today." He escorted her through the busy hotel lobby which was full of people checking out of their rooms and grabbing continental breakfast. Several heads turned as the swishing of her skirt and clacking of her heels on the marble entry way drew attention. Remembering Roy's advice about showing off, Valarie spied an empty chair in the lobby and steered Nelson toward it. 

 "Oh dear," she said, putting her right foot on the arm of the chair, "my strap came loose." With her leg in the air like this, she knew her legs were on display as was her cleavage, which threatened to spill out the top of the tube top as she leaned over. She had left the zipper half way down for a reason. She knew Nelson was watching, and so were a lot of others. After a minute of pretending to fix the ankle strap, she switched legs. "I better check this one while I'm at it." 

 Then, on the way out to the car, which Nelson had left in the valet loop in front of the hotel, Valarie saw the group of half a dozen valet drivers grouped in front of the hotel. Their eyes all locked on her as soon as they came out into the open air and Valarie reacted instantly, dropping her hotel room key in front of her and just a few feet away from the group. Ever so slowly, she bent at the waist and picked it up. The skirt didn't ride up as high as she wanted, but it was still enough to give them a good show if they just ducked their heads a bit and looked up her skirt. 

 "That was nice," Nelson said as they got in the car. "You're adapting to this very well." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said. "I'm doing my best." She thought about Roy's advice again and said, "Sir, may I please suck your big yummy cock?" 

 Nelson didn't seem surprised to hear this, but was visibly pleased. She was progressing very nicely. "Hmm," he grinned. "Why?" 

 A test, Valarie realized. Her first instinct was to say that she loved to taste him or wanted his cum, but remembered that they had stressed she be honest and not pretend to love it if she didn't. She answered honestly, "Because I want to show you what I've learned." Nelson's broad smile told her that she couldn't have given a better answer. 

 "Yes, my dear, you may suck my cock." He sat back and unzipped his pants, pulling his half-erect penis out into view. Valarie waited for him to start the car and start driving, but he just sat there. "Oh, I think we should do it before we go. It's a short drive," he grinned. 

 "But," Valarie said, looking around, "the valets are right there, sir. They can see us. They're watching." 

 Nelson looked over at the guys, waving to them and smiling. "So they are," he nodded. 

 The message was clear. He wanted the audience. Again, just when she thought she had it all figured out, here was another curve from her trainers. OK, if this is what he wanted. She leaned over in the seat and took his cock in her mouth, putting her hands behind her back for emphasis. She knew the valets had seen her head go down. They could see Nelson leaning back in his seat, his gaze downward. They knew what she was doing. 

 She heard voices and looked up. She saw the valets crowded around the car now, watching her with awe and appreciation. "Please, continue," Nelson said gently. "You're doing well, my sweet little slut." 

 Feeling tingly all over and exposed and wanton and slutty, Valarie resumed her task, swallowing all of his hard cock now, bobbing her head up and down. 

 "They'll want to see you swallow it," Nelson said. Valarie understood. When he came, she caught it in her mouth just like she had done for Roy last night. She sat up in the car seat, rolled down her window and playfully wagged her fingers at the valets, as if they needed an invitation to look at her. She opened her mouth and showed them the mouthful of cum she was holding. Watching their eyes, she swallowed it in one gulp. The engine started and they roared off, Valarie waving to her admirers as they sped away. 

 Nelson praised her for her rapid improvement on her technique and willingness to set aside her inhibitions about public exposure in order to fulfill his request. "Now, you're doing well with your attire," he said, "very well. I know your resources are limited, too. So, today, we're going to fix that. We're going to spend a crazy amount of money so you'll have hundreds of different choices when it comes to finding sexy and seductive outfits. That means heels, boots, stockings, garters, lingerie, dresses, active wear, work wear, jewelry, makeup, the works. Understand?" 

 "Sure," Valarie said. "It sounds like a lot of fun. I'm glad you're going to show me what you have in mind, though." 

 "No, I won't," Nelson said. "You already have a good idea, I'm sure, but I'm going to give you an assistant to help with your selections?" 

 "An assistant? Who?" 

 "Her name is Coco," Nelson said. "Well, that's her stage name anyway. Yes, she's a stripper. I think she's done some escort work as well. We went out a few times. Purely sexual. She's a lot of fun and I think you'll like her." 

 "I can't wait to meet her," Valarie said. 

 "Good, because there she is now." Valarie followed Nelson's gaze and saw a beautiful woman standing at the entrance to an apartment complex. She was waving and jumping up and down as she saw them pulling over. She wore no bra and her tits -- almost certainly fake -- bounced noticeably underneath her tattered white tank top that had been raggedly cut off just below her breasts. She was a Brazilian beauty who looked to be a little older than Valarie - - probably upper 20s -- and had beautiful skin, the color of which was clearly inspiration for her stage name. She wore tiny white cotton booty shorts and a bright red thong and bright red six-inch heels. Clearly, being naked or nearly so was of little concern to Coco. 

 Coco opened the back door and hopped in, her breasts still bouncing as she leaned forward between the front seats and kissed Nelson on the cheek and shook Valarie's hand, a broad smile on her face the whole time. 

 "It's so nice to meet you," Coco said warmly. "This is going to be so much fun. I just love shopping. Ooh, and you're right, Jimmy, she is gorgeous. I can see why you want her hanging around the office. If she's half as smart as she is pretty, you got yourselves a winner." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said, a bit overwhelmed by Coco's bubbly body and even bubblier personality. This girl made tons of money on stage or on her back or her knees -- wherever she was, Valarie was certain men would follow. Why wouldn't Nelson and his guys just hire someone like her? Valarie knew the answer, but didn't want to sound conceited, even to herself. They didn't hire someone like Coco because they wanted someone who could be like Coco at times, but also a sophisticated lady and a reliable employee. Valarie looked at Coco's made-for-sex body and felt a bit intimidated, but she found comfort in knowing there were men like Nelson who appreciated the fact that Valarie had more than just looks to offer and found her to be extremely attractive in her own right. 

 Just a few minutes later, Nelson dropped them off at an upscale shopping area that had many clothing stores, including some specialty stores. He handed Coco his credit card.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 02 ****** bydlsloan© "No expense is too great," he said. "Get some things for yourself, too, Coco. Call me when you're ready to be picked up. And, Valarie, be wearing something appropriate for a a charity fundraiser banquet." 

 Coco led Valarie into store after store. She would grab clothes by the armload and take them to Valarie, who waited in the dressing room, trying on one item after another. Coco insisted that she see everything Valarie tried on. "Remember, it's not whether you like it or not or how it feels on you, it's how it looks to them," Coco said. "A little tighter, a little shorter than you might like is still a little looser or a little longer than they might like." 

 "You know, not every outfit is for sex, right?" Valarie reminded her. 

 "Honey," Coco laughed, "it's all about sex. Always. You think Nelson isn't going to fuck you after he shows you off at that banquet tonight? No, he doesn't want you dressed like a hooker, but he wants you to be sexy, count on that. And if you're sexy enough, he might haul you into some closet and do you right there. Yeah, Jimmy and those guys are nice guys, but they still want what all guys want. They just respect you more than most. Be thankful. They're good guys. They'll take care of you if you take care of them. And they sure as hell won't hurt you. But never, ever forget that it's about sex first and foremost. The job, the friendships, the money, that's all secondary. Remember that every time you get dressed up for them. Always, always error on the side of too sexy. They'll never complain, I promise you." 

 "OK," Valarie nodded, trusting her new friend's advice. Coco seemed to know what she was talking about. Valarie liked her. She was a lot of fun to shop with, even if she was buying things Valarie would never have even tried on. Good thing she's here, I guess, Valarie thought. 

 They bought lingerie, swimsuits, underwear, skirts, dresses, blouses, tank tops, shorts, stockings, jewelry, shoes, boots and some garments Valarie couldn't even put a name to. She had never seen some of the clothes Coco was finding for her. Coco herself bought several items as well, any of which would serve her well as escort or stripper either one. 

 Everywhere they went, the beautiful pair of scantily clad women drew attention, heads turning, cell phone cameras flipping open, jaws dropping. Valarie wondered if this was what celebrities felt like, maybe just a little. Always the center of attention, every move being watched and photographed, often without your consent or knowledge. She thought about all the eyes that had studied her ass today, gazed at her breasts, imagined her naked. She thought about men touching themselves as they watched her, thought about her, looked at her picture later in the privacy of their own homes. She'd never had trouble attracting men, but this was a whole new game. This was being a sex symbol, an object of lust and desire, a piece of eye candy on display for the world to see. It was far more exciting than she ever could have imagined and she found herself thinking about Nelson, her gorgeous date for the night. She was so ready for him, so ready to be shown off and then used any way he desired. Submitting to him, pleasing him, it was going to be fantastic! 

 "So, I guess we need to pick out a cocktail dress for you for your date tonight," Coco said. "Cocktail. That's funny. He wants to put his cock in your tail. That's the kind of dress we need all right." 

 They both laughed and Valarie felt herself getting warmer just thinking about his hard cock in her tight little pussy. She imagined him doing like Coco said, grabbing her by the wrist, dragging her to some cramped janitor's closet and fucking her right there, the door barely muffling her moans of desire, people gathering around outside, knowing what was going on, listening, waiting to see who would come out. Oh, she'd feel like such a slut coming out of there. Or would she? Maybe she'd feel like a star and they'd all be jealous -- jealous of her luxurious life, her gorgeous date, her own beauty and sexuality, jealous that she could and would do what they secretly wanted to do themselves. Slut or star, either way, she'd be the center of attention, the object of desire and, hopefully, a happy girl with a well-fucked, happy little girl with a well- fucked e object of desire and, hopefully, a happy girl with a well-fucked pussy.o what they wanted to pussy. 

 She went into another dressing room, stripping off her skirt one more time. This time, she untied her panties, too, and sat on the little bench. She put one foot on the bench and reached between her legs, stroking herself, feeling how wet she had gotten after just a few minutes of fantasy. She started rubbing her clit in little circles, her pussy growing wetter and hotter. She closed her eyes for a minute, telling herself she had to stop, to go get the clothes from Coco to try on. Just another second... 

 "Well, well," a happy voice said softly. "I told you it's all about sex." 

 Valarie's eyes snapped open and she dropped her foot to the floor, but it was way too late. Coco stood in front of her, an armload of cocktail dresses in hand, her eyes where Valarie's hand had just been. Valarie looked at the door and realized she must not have gotten the latch all the way shut. 

 "Wondered what was taking so long," Coco said, smiling. "Sorry I interrupted. Were you thinking about Nelson?" 

 "Yes," Valarie said, her face red. "I, well, I was thinking about what you said. Showing me off tonight, then taking me into a closet. Everyone listening, knowing what we're doing. Then him taking me home and doing it all night." 

 "He will, too," Coco said. "He's as strong as he is handsome. He'll have something for you all night. I know from experience." She didn't say it to be bragging. 

 "I assumed you two had ..." Valarie's voice tailed off, not sure who else might be in the dressing room, and not sure why she cared. 

 "A few times," Coco said. "We're sort of each other's booty call, you know. Horny. It's late. You want a hot fuck and no strings." 

 "I understand," Valarie said. "You're so beautiful. I'm, well, jealous." 

 "Of me? Oh, don't be, please. You're so gorgeous. And you don't have to have fake tits and slutty stripper clothes to get attention. You're hot, girl. Don't sell yourself short. You think those guys would pick you otherwise?" 

 "I guess not," Valarie said. "I just, I want to please them but I don't know if I'm doing what they want." 

 "Just listen to them and watch their eyes, their reactions," Coco said. "You pick it up really fast. I didn't know how to dance on a pole. Then I started. I watched what men liked, what got them out of their seats to bring me a dollar, what made them yell or clap. I learned what moves they liked and what they didn't. You'll catch on, believe me. 

 "Now, in the meantime, it looks like we need to finish some business before you try these on," Coco said. 

 "Finish business? You mean..." 

 "Yeah," Coco whispered. "That's exactly what I mean. You need a hot fuck, not strings, you need it now, right? Allow me, my dear." 

 Coco put her hands on the insides of Valarie's thighs and slowly spread them open, pushing her back against the wall of the little changing room. Valarie wondered if anyone was in the other stalls, listening. She wondered if they heard her little moan as Coco put her tongue to Valarie's wet pussy lips or if they heard the wet little sound as Coco kissed her thighs. 

 Valarie had never been with a woman before. Never thought about it. She didn't think of other women that way. Didn't find them attractive. But now, in this moment, a moment of weakness and lust, she wanted nothing more than to have Coco's talented tongue inside her, caressing her, teasing her, tasting her. Coco was better than any man she had ever had down there. Obviously, Coco was the sort of woman who could please anyone. Sex was her skill, her art, and she had perfected it. 

 Coco smiled at Valarie and kissed her hard on the mouth, her hands squeezing Valarie's breasts. Valarie found her own hands on Coco's squishy fake tits, tweaking the nipples the same way she liked to have hers toyed with. 

 Coco's hand felt between Valarie's legs, her fingers probing inside her pussy now, stroking ever so gently, teasing that oh-so-sweet spot just inside her. Valarie squirmed on the bench, uncomfortable, hot, wanting so desperately to cum. Coco was kissing her breasts now and Valarie surprised herself by pushing on the top of her head, guiding her back down between her legs. She felt like a guy signaling for a blowjob. Coco obediently tasted her again, her tongue dancing around her clit, her lips kissing it gently. Valarie raised her hips and ground her pussy against Coco's face, making sure that tongue hit just in the right spot. It did, again and again until finally Valarie hit the peak and came. She bit her lip hard, trying not to let her ragged breathing give away her moment of ecstasy. 

 "Can I ... you?" she said softly afterward. 

 "No, I know that's not your thing, at least not yet," Coco smiled back. "Maybe some other time. I'll let the guys train you if that's what they want. But you owe me nothing. OK?" 

 "OK," Valarie said. "Thank you." 

 She put her panties back on and started trying on dresses until she found the right one for the banquet. "We bought the perfect heels and g-string to go with this earlier," Coco said. But they had left their purchases at each store and would arrange delivery later. "We don't have time to go back. But that's OK. They have plenty of options here. I'll be right back." 

 When she returned, they finished dressing Valarie for the evening and called Nelson to come pick them up. 

 The dress was white, sleeveless and form fitting. It hugged her curves and came just past her ass, though it would ride up with almost any movement. It was made of lycra and had hundreds of little holes in it. They were uniform in size and in straight lines. They were each about the size of a quarter and spaced about three inches apart on going across and one inch apart from top to bottom. It was almost like someone had perforated it. Presumably, for an eye-catching look, but, just like a perforated piece of paper, there was little doubt the dress could be torn easily along the lines of holes if someone had such an idea. 

 None of the holes were particularly close to her nipples -- by design, Valarie had to assume -- and she was grateful. With the dress stuck to her like plastic wrap, there was no concern about it slipping around and one of her nipples accidentally being exposed. If she -- or someone else --wanted that to happen, they would have to physically shift the material one way or the other. That was a relief because Valarie was already preoccupied with tugging at the bottom of the dress to keep from showing off her ass. 

 White stiletto heels with white ankle straps drew even more attention to Valarie's legs and all those who would certainly be studying her ass would be able to clearly see the thin straps of a black g-string over her hips. They would also have little trouble noticing that she wore no bra. Even while not erect, her nipples were clearly outlined against the skin-tight garment. 

 She wore large silver hoop earrings, a gaudy diamond bracelet and large round dark sunglasses. She looked like a movie star on the red carpet in a dazzling dress designed to draw attention and create a stir. 

 "Wow, you look like a million dollars," Coco said as they walked back out toward the front of the store where Nelson would pick them up. "People will assume you're famous and ask for your autograph, I bet." 

 "You think?" Valarie giggled. "I feel so..." 

 "Glamorous?" Coco offered. 

 "Exposed," Valarie said, tugging at the bottom of the dress, well aware that it was showing off the bottom curve of her ass. "I don't feel like I'm wearing anything at all. You can see everything in this." 

 "And yet nothing," Coco said. "That's the beauty of it. Sexy, yes. A bit slutty, oh yes. Naughty, hell yes. But illegal or scandalous. Nope. With that gorgeous hunk of a man next to you, all eyes will be on you two tonight. Every man there will want to trade places with Jimmy and every woman there will want to have your body and your man. Live it up, sister, you're going to have a great time." 

 Valarie noticed that Coco called him "Jimmy" and wondered if she should become less formal in addressing the guys as well. Did they want her to have cute pet names for them? Or would they find that immature and silly? 

 "I can't thank you enough," Valarie said. "For this, for all the advice, for ... well, you know." 

 "I know," Coco said. "I see why they like you. You're sweet. In more ways than one." 

 They both laughed. "But you're also sexy as hell. You just don't know it yet," Coco continued. "That's a good thing. Guys like that. They like girls who are prettier than they give themselves credit for, who are kind and sweet but have that little bit of a naughty, adventurous side. You've got that. All of it. I'd pay a million bucks to have your ass. Hell, I paid half that for these tits." 

 They both laughed again, then waved as they saw Nelson speeding toward them. 

 "Whatever I paid you, double it," he said to Coco as they got in. "That's a fantastic outfit. Oh my, Valarie, you look amazing." 

 "Thank you," she said softly, admiring Nelson, who looked especially handsome in a tailored dark suit. "It's all Coco. She knows what to do." 

 "Well, I grant you she knows what she's doing," Nelson said, "but what I'm looking at is all you, not Coco." 

 "That's what I keep telling her," Coco said. "She doesn't realize how gorgeous she is. I know you guys love that ass, right?" 

 "Of course," Nelson laughed. "Best ass and legs you'll ever see. And the rest is pretty damn nice too. You have amazing eyes and smile, Valarie. You look stunning. I can't believe you guys weren't followed by a dozen guys." 

 "Oh, they were watching us all right," Coco said. "Probably see our pictures on who knows what web sites tonight. Damn cell phone cameras are everywhere." 

 "Well, I like taking pictures too," Nelson said. "That's why we're going to have a little fashion show later. But for now, we're late. Coco, do you mind if I drop you at the house and you can prepare the fashion show? I called the driver and the clothes you guys bought should be delivered in about an hour. I don't need to see everything all at once. Just pick out 10 or 12 nice things. You know what to do." 

 "I sure do," Coco said. "See you guys later. Val, watch out for the broomstick." 

 Valarie laughed, remembering the janitor's closet. "What was that about a broomstick?" Nelson asked. 

 "I'll tell you later," Valarie said. Then she leaned over, turned his head and kissed him hard on the mouth. "Thank you for all the clothes." 

 "You're welcome," Nelson said. "I'm sure you'll continue to show me your appreciation this evening." 

 "Any way you want," Valarie practically purred. 

 "Surprise me," Nelson teased. 

 "I'm not sure that's possible," Valarie laughed, "but I'll try. Speaking of surprises, what exactly is this banquet we're going to?" 

 "It's for a charity our firm supports," Nelson said. "Every year, they have this big black-tie dinner and a silent auction and raise tons of money. There will be a couple hundred people in there. The food will be cold and lousy, the speakers will be boring and the silent auction items are the same every year. Still, it's a great cause and we love supporting it, so we come every year." 

 "Sounds good," Valarie said. "You said black-tie dinner. Does that mean I should be wearing a black dress?" 

 "No," Nelson said. "You shouldn't be wearing anything other than what you have on right now. That's absolutely perfect. Will most of the women be in black? Yes, or some other dark color. That's fine, though, because it will make you stand out that much more. And I want everyone to see you tonight." 

 Valarie was suddenly very nervous. Earlier, the idea of being the center of attention had been exciting. Now, though, knowing she would be dressed so differently in front of such a formal crowd, her body so blatantly displayed, she was jittery and worried. Nelson sensed this and put his hand on her bare thigh. His touch was warm, strong, reassuring. 

 "Relax," he said. "People will look at you, yes. They will comment, yes. But they will be jealous at heart. You look amazing. Be confident, be strong. I know you are. Embrace it. Enjoy it. Don't let it intimidate you. Be a star tonight." 

 "OK," Valarie nodded. "Thank you. I'll try... I mean, I will." 

 "That's better," Nelson smiled. Then to break the tension, he asked, "So, it seems that you and Coco got along quite well. Anything interesting I should know about?" 

 "How did you...?" Valarie started, realizing she had given it away just by saying that much. She blushed, shifted in her seat, remembering Coco's sweet tongue. "Well, yes, in the dressing room we, uh, got better acquainted. I hope it's OK." 

 "Of course it is," Nelson said. "Never apologize for being a sexy girl. I know from your interview that was your first time with a woman. What did you think?" 

 "Incredible," Valarie said honestly. "She ... touched me differently than a man. I liked it." 

 "Sure," Nelson said. "That's good. Nothing wrong with that. So long as you still prefer men." 

 "Oh, absolutely," Valarie said. "I'm not attracted to women, really, it just sort of ... happened." 

 "How?" 

 "Well, I was thinking about tonight, about you," Valarie said, finding it nearly impossible not to tell him everything. He was so easy to talk to about extremely private things. "I was waiting for Coco to bring some more clothes and I got... excited. I touched myself. I thought about you taking me into some janitor's closet tonight and having sex with me right here at the banquet." 

 "That's where the broomstick comes in," Nelson nodded. 

 "Yeah, well, I was thinking about that, touching myself and forgot about Coco. She found me in the dressing room with my panties off. She ... offered to help. She was so sweet. And she said I was too," Valarie added, giggling. 

 "I wish I could have seen that," Nelson said. "Well, like I said, don't apologize for being sexy. Women can get horny and lusty and naughty just like men. Janitor's closet, huh? Well, we might just have to scout around and find one." 

 Valarie didn't even think about objecting. 

 They pulled up to a conference center attached to a hotel and Nelson turned the car over to a valet. Valarie noticed the other people walking in. They were all dressed so nicely. Expensive suits, formal dresses, most of which were at least knee length. Most the attendees were in their 30s or older, too. Valarie realized she would not only have the most eye-catching, revealing dress on, but she would also be one of the youngest people there. Most of Valarie's other experiences that had involved being the best or most anything involved academics. Otherwise, she had always sort of blended in despite her sweet demeanor and natural beauty. She had never been one to draw extreme amounts of attention. That was changing fast. 

 Nelson helped her out of the car and Valarie tugged her dress down. "Don't touch the dress again," he whispered in her ear. "If it needs to be adjusted, I will do so." 

 "Yes sir," Valarie said softly as they entered the huge building and followed the crowd into the banquet hall. Already Valarie heard murmurs in the crowd and felt hot stares on her body. She knew they were looking at her, talking about her. But she hugged Nelson's arm tightly and felt safe. She was with the strongest, best-looking gentlemen there and she felt safe with him. She forced herself to think about what he wanted from her tonight and not what others were thinking. He wanted her to be proud and strong and confident, to carry an air of sophistication and class despite her attire. He wanted to be able to show her off and make other men jealous. She would do that for him, if she could.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 02 ****** bydlsloan© She returned the lusty looks from men and critical frowns from women with the same glowing smile that had earned her compliments all her life. She looked right back into their eyes with her own shimmering jewels, trusting the pretty, confident, light-up-the-room face that had always been her best feature. Of course, a lot of the looks were going to what most of the guys considered her best features -- her ass and her legs. They were displayed brilliantly in this outfit and most of the men didn't even try to hide their obvious interest and appreciation. 

 Nelson was smiling, nodding to familiar faces, leading Valarie to the bar. He got them both a drink and they continued mingling. They bumped into acquaintances and he introduced Valarie with pride in his voice, treating her with all the respect of a princess. A star, Valarie reminded herself, be a star. She greeted everyone with her sparkling eyes and warm smile, shaking hands and complimenting other women on their glamorous dresses. She was witty, charming and graceful. 

 "You're doing great," Nelson whispered to her as he led her to their assigned table. 

 He introduced her to the others at the table -- four other couples. Two of the woman looked openly hostile toward her, but the other two were civil, one of them even complimenting her earrings. For the most part, Valarie ate quietly, listening to Nelson and the other men swap fishing stories and discuss the woes of the local baseball team. She ate carefully, trying to make sure she got nothing on her dress. 

 As Nelson had promised, the food wasn't great and the speakers were boring. But after dinner, a live band started playing jazz and everyone started drinking and dancing. 

 "Come on," Nelson said. "Let's check out the silent auction stuff. I need to bid on something. We write a big enough check every year, I suppose, but I still feel like we need to contribute whatever we can." 

 They walked up and down the rows of tables, looking at the trips and expensive wines and other valuable items that had been offered up. Gaining confidence now, Valarie started leaning over the items, pretending to read the descriptions, study the bids or look more closely at an item. What she was really doing was showing off for Nelson and anyone else who was watching, which, as had been the case practically all day, was any man in the vicinity. As she bent over at the waist, she knew her dress was riding up, showing about half of her ass cheeks and, if the angle and lighting were just right in the now dimly lit dance hall, a peek at her barely covered pussy. Her long legs looked lean and toned, she knew, in her heels. 

 "Do you ever submit anything for the auction?" Valarie asked. 

 "No," Nelson said. 

 "You should sometime," she said. 

 Nelson looked around, smiling as if he just had a great idea. He noticed all the men looking at her, but instead of lust in their eyes, he suddenly saw dollar signs. Most of the men were here with their wives, but some were here with dates they didn't really want to be with or had come stag. There would be enough, he knew. 

 "That's a great idea," he nodded. "Let's do it right now." 

 "Now?" Valarie asked. "But what could you have to ...." It dawned on her what he had to offer. Her. 

 "Now, don't worry, I'm not going to prostitute you," Nelson said. "But I think we can let someone have a little fun in exchange for a big check to a good cause." 

 "Whatever you want," Valarie said, the words leaving her mouth before she had time to think about what she was agreeing to. He outlined it to her quickly. 

 "Do you think they will like that?" she asked. "I mean, it's pretty racy for a formal crowd." 

 "Someone will write a big check," Nelson said. "That's all this big crowd really cares about. And we write a big enough one they will listen to us." 

 He found one of the board members and laid out what he wanted to offer. The man looked at Valarie approvingly. "Are you sure you're up for this, my dear?" 

 "Anything for such a good cause," she smiled back. 

 "OK. Well, let me get my camera." 

 Five minutes later, a new auction item was added to the table. The item displayed was a picture of Valarie in her barely there white dress. Underneath, it said: "For bid, the Valarie experience. Winner gets to remove Valarie's panties and keep them. Winner receives one slow dance with Valarie and a kiss from Valarie. Winner gets to take up to 10 photos of and/or with Valarie. Minimum bid: $1,000." 

 "Do you really think someone will pay that much for ... me?" Valarie asked. 

 "I know it. Just watch." 

 Valarie and Nelson stood near the bar, sipping their drinks, watching as first one man, then others started gathering around the bid table. Valarie was stunned to see several of them making bids. She had assumed no one would bid and nothing would happen. Now, she realized, she would be paying up very soon. The auction was almost over. 

 The winner was a young man about Valarie's age. He was a bit chubby, but not altogether unattractive. "I'm Jeff," he said, introducing himself to Nelson and Valarie. 

 "Very nice to meet you, Jeff," Valarie said. "Thank you for bidding on me. I'm flattered." 

 "You're beautiful," Jeff said. "I would have kicked myself if I hadn't bid. So, um, where do we go to do this?" 

 "Right here," Nelson said. 

 "I get to.... Right here?" 

 "Yes. Valarie, why don't you show him his first prize?" 

 Valarie looked around, aware that circle of men was beginning to form. She took a deep breath and tugged her dress up the rest of the way over her ass cheeks. She hooked her thumbs in the straps of her g-string. "They're all yours," she teased. Then, biting her lip and pouting sexily, she said, "but I can't get them off by myself. Can you please help me?" 

 Men were groaning and offering assistance and Jeff beamed as he knelt down in front of her. With shaky hands, he grabbed the straps of her g-string and slid them down her thighs. The silky material clung stubbornly inside her ass cheeks and to her moist pussy, but gradually gave way. As it did, Jeff licked his lips and Nelson slowly tugged Valarie's dress back down over her ass cheeks. 

 Valarie stepped out of the underwear and Jeff stood up, waving it triumphantly to the group of onlookers, grown, professional men in tailored suits whooping and hollering like frat boys now. 

 "Care to dance," Jeff asked Valarie, holding out his hand. 

 "Of course, kind sir," she said, taking his hand and placing it around her waist. 

 On the dance floor, Jeff kept his hands on Valarie's hips and she had her arms around his neck. She whispered in his ear, "You can grab my ass if you want." 

 Jeff didn't need any further encouragement, quickly running his hands down her hips and cupping her ass. He gave her firm cheeks a little squeeze as their feet moved slowly to the music. Valarie knew everyone was watching them dance, could see her pressed closely to him, could see his hands on her ass and her not resisting. They could see him reaching lower, touching the bare flesh of the bottom curve of her ass cheeks, his fingers just inches now from her exposed pussy. Her nipples were hard now and she could feel them pressing against his chest. Everyone would be able to see them as soon as the song was over and they'd see her excitement and know she was aroused. Jeff surely already sensed that, from her hard nipples and the telltale dampness of the g- string that was stuffed in his pocket. He had to know. He was aroused too, she could tell. His cock was hard and pressed against her belly. She thought about Nelson's cock, about making it hard too. 

 The dance ended and Valarie gave him a big kiss on the mouth, not denying his tongue's entrance into her mouth. She felt his cock lurch against her and suddenly felt a pang of guilt to have made him so hard without offering him a release. But that wasn't part of the deal. They went back to the bar and the board member who had helped them before offered his camera to Jeff. 

 "Take the pictures and I'll give you the memory card to do with as you please," he said. 

 Valarie looked around for Nelson, but didn't see him. She knew he wouldn't be far away. 

 They stood before a curtained backdrop that had been used for the photos of the top fundraisers and volunteers. First, Jeff took pictures of Valarie posing for him, cupping her breasts playfully, sucking on her finger, bending over a table, straddling a chair. Then, he had the board member take pictures of her kissing Jeff on the cheek, him standing behind her, cupping her breasts, her bent over the table, with him behind her, hands on her ass. Finally, he had her stick her tongue in her mouth and make a fist with her hand as if she were offering him a blowjob, looking at him with her sparkling, naughty eyes. Then, for the last picture, he had her kneel down in front of him, his bulge noticeable in his pants as she licked her lips and put her hands on his belt buckle. 

 "Those are great!" he said, thanking her. Valarie stood up and smiled back at the group of onlookers, laughing, letting them know she was having fun. Kill them with sweetness, she thought. She was just giving Jeff a farewell peck on the cheek when she felt a hand grab her wrist. It was Nelson. He looked serious and started leading her through the crowd, not roughly, but quickly. They exited the banquet hall and entered a large concourse. Nelson looked behind them. There were a few people in the concourse, milling about, but not money. He led Valarie to a small door, grinning now. Valarie was too. On the door it said, "Janitorial Service." He wagged a key in front of her, then opened the door. Valarie scurried inside, Nelson right behind her. 

 Within seconds, her dress was around her waist, her legs were around his waist and he was all the way inside her. He pinned her to the wall with his hips and he grabbed at her dress, pulling it until her nipples were poking out of two of the holes. He immediately started tweaking and pulling them, then put them in his mouth while he put his hands under her ass and started lifting her up and down. Valarie seldom made a lot of noise during sex, but she was breathing hard now, groaning with each hard thrust. Nelson, too, was grunting. They bumped into trash cans and stacks of paper towels and bottles of cleaning supplies, creating a racket and drawing a small crowd outside the door. 

 Valarie had her legs and arms wrapped around Nelson, clinging to him tightly, molding her body to his. Valarie had never really cooled down after her orgasm with Coco. In fact, she'd be on edge, aroused, ready to go all day. Every second of the day had revolved around sex in some way shape or form and the sum total of the evening's events had made her every bit as horny as Nelson. She came suddenly, a quick shriek followed by a long, low whimper as she clung to him. She knew if anyone was outside, they would have heard her. She didn't care. 

 "Someone's having a good time in there," she heard a deep voice say from the other side of the door. Couldn't argue with that. Nelson doubled his efforts now, dropping her down onto a table, throwing her legs over his shoulders and driving his cock down into her. He came inside her in a torrent of white, creamy jism, a loud, triumphant grunt announcing his accomplishment to the world outside. 

 Afterward, they clutched each other tightly, giggling as they listened to the people outside, speculating who was in there and what was going on. Naturally, many mentioned the "girl in the slutty white dress" and she knew they suspected that she was involved. 

 They put themselves back together and prepared to go out and face the crowd. Nelson led the way, leading Valarie by the wrist. There was a little applause, some laughter, some sneers and some disapproving looks. Valarie and Nelson didn't care. The smiles on their faces were genuine and nothing could wipe them away. 

 Nelson led Valarie to the nearest exit and out to the car, opening the door for her, always a gentleman. 

 In the car, Valarie looked at Nelson, drawn not only by his appearance, but his confidence and charisma. "Coco called you Jimmy before," Valarie said. "Is that what you would like me to call you, sir?" 

 "Well, certainly don't call me sir away from the office," he chuckled. "But no, I don't much care for Jimmy. I let Coco do it because, well..." 

 "She's Coco," Valarie nodded. 

 "Yeah," Nelson said. "But you can call me a James or Jim if you like. Or stud." 

 "Stud it is," she laughed. "No, I like Jim. Thanks for a wonderful time tonight, Jim. Thanks for all the clothes, Jim. Thanks for fucking me silly, Jim. Yeah, I like the sound of that." 

 "The way you say it, I like it too," Nelson said. "And I don't just mean your accent." 

 "I just can't believe I did all that tonight," she said. 

 "All what?" 

 "You know, showing off like that, auctioning myself off, having sex with you in the janitor's closet," she said. "I just... I never thought I'd do anything like that. And I didn't think I would, well, like it so much. It's such a turn- on, but it's so scary too. I just can't believe it all happened." 

 "Well, I hope you don't think we're done for the night," Nelson said. 

 "Oh no," Valarie said quickly. "Coco warned me about that." 

 "What did she say?" he smiled. 

 "Not to expect much sleep," Valarie laughed. 

 "I'd say that's true," Nelson said, putting his hand on her thigh. "You've got me thinking all kinds of naughty thoughts." 

 "Really?" Valarie said, flattered. "I never thought I made men think that way." 

 "You sure do," Nelson said. "Lots of guys going home from that banquet tonight might be fucking their dates, but they'll be thinking about you." 

 "Oh dear, you really think so?" 

 "I guarantee it." 

 When they got back to his house, Coco was there and so were all of their purchases from the day. It was getting late, but Coco was used to late hours and Nelson and Valarie were far too high to think about slowing down. After a quick tour -- as quick as you can tour a 5,000 square foot home -- of his home, Nelson led Valarie into his spacious living room where Coco had made arrangements for the fashion show and photo shoot. She had the clothes laid out and Nelson's camera and tripod set up. A straight-back chair, baby oil, lollipops, a hard wood bench and bottles of water were among the props nearby. 

 "How was the banquet?" Coco asked. 

 "Great," Nelson said. "Valarie made a very large donation to the cause and I made a very large donation to her pussy." 

 "And I didn't fall on the broomstick!" Valarie laughed. 

 "Sounds like a wonderful night," Coco said. "I can see you're ready for more, so let's get started. I have picked out a sampling of some of the clothes we bought today. Valarie, you will model them for Jimmy and he will probably take some pictures, ask you to do a few poses. When you get to where you can't wait any more, you two can go fuck like bunnies and I'll call a taxi. Sound like a plan?" 

 "Perfect," Nelson said. "Well done, Coco." 

 Coco handed Valarie an outfit and showed her behind a small curtain she had set up. "I don't get to watch?" Nelson moaned. He had taken off his jacket, tie, shoes, socks and slacks and watched in the comfort of an unbuttoned dress shirt and his boxers. 

 "Easy, tiger," Coco teased back. "You get to play dress up and Barbie doll and whatever else you want with her all night. Let the girl have some peace and get a chance to show off a little for you before you start ripping her clothes off again." 

 "All right, fair enough," Nelson chuckled. "But I'm horny and in the presence of two beautiful sluts. I'm not responsible for my actions." 

 "Neither are we," Coco teased again. 

 The first outfit was a sexy piece of lingerie. On top was a sheer white scarf that tied loosely around her neck with a frilly bow at her throat. There were no sleeves or back to it. Instead, the ends hung loosely like a pair of drapes over either breast, leaving bare the smooth skin between her breasts and her belly. A matching pair of sheer white bikini panties and some white stilettos completed the picture. 

 Valarie strode confidently across the floor, her long, strong legs carrying her athletic body sensually. She turned and let him see from the back, then faced him, hands on hips. 

 "Outstanding," Nelson nodded. He stepped forward and touched the soft fabric, lifting one side of the top to expose her breast, then letting it fall back down in place. "Pose for me." 

 "How?" Valerie asked, ready to serve. 

 "However you want," Nelson said. "Tease me. Show me what you have. Think about centerfold and swimsuit models you've seen pictures of." 

 Valarie realized he was testing her, to see if she had learned enough yet to understand how to display herself for him and the others. Right now, she had to think about it, arching her back to make her breasts stick out, pinching her nipples to make them hard, keeping her legs straight and slightly spread when she bent over to give the best view of her ass, pussy and legs all at once. She had to think about how to purse her lips or pout or smile, how to suck on her finger or cup her breast to demonstrate arousal and desire. It wasn't easy, but she did it without instruction from either Coco or Nelson. The camera snapped repeatedly and she trusted that was a good sign. She could see now she would have to practice this, however, to become so natural at it that displaying her body in its most sexually appealing way would become second nature. 

 The next dress made her hole-filled, skin-tight dress from the banquet look like a ball gown. It was black with spaghetti straps over the shoulders and hung down to her knees on her left side. The hem, however, was curved, angling sharply up her body. The slinky garment covered her right breast, but there was no right side to the dress. Her thigh, ass and side of her breast were completely exposed and one needed only to "pull back the curtain" to see the whole show. In effect, it was like a single curtain draped over one about two- thirds of her body, leaving one entire side bare. The clingy material wrapped around her firm round breasts and the dark dress matched her silky black hair. Black stilettos were the only shoes for this dress and Valarie's had a pair of sexy thin straps around each ankle. 

 Again, Nelson nodded his approval and took many photos. Valarie used the open side of the dress to her advantage, putting a leg up on the coffee table, showing off the curve of her legs and ass, the smooth skin of her belly and the tantalizing roundness of her breast. 

 The show-stopper outfit, though, was the most extreme mini skirt Valarie had ever scene. It was bright red, six inches top to bottom, with a five and a half inch slit up the side. She wore it low on her hips to cover her pussy, leaving a wide bare space between her navel and the top of the skirt. The slit, which was on one side only, left her thigh exposed and was an invitation for a gentleman friend to reach underneath. The top was no less appealing. It was a deeply scooped cowl, the same bright red color and stretchy, soft satiny material. It tied behind her neck and the loose, low hanging scoop neck reconnected just above her belly button, where the top came to an end. It wrapped tightly around her waist, accentuating the curve from her breasts to her waist. Red pumps matched perfectly. 

 Nelson took dozens of pictures, occasionally touching his hard cock while Valarie teased him with her legs and ass and her stunning eyes. She stood, legs far apart, and bent over at the waist, showing him her bare ass underneath that tiny skirt. She got on all fours on the bench, reaching back to grab her heels, showing off her curves and her flexibility at the same time. She straddled the hard back chair, arms supporting her chin on the back of the chair, legs spread wide, looking long and lean and inviting.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 02 ****** bydlsloan© "That's it," Nelson said. "I can't take it any more. Great job, Coco. Now leave. I've got something to do." 

 "You mean someone," Coco laughed. She gave him a kiss and Valarie a hug and let herself out while Nelson approached Valarie. 

 "Have you seen the pool yet?" 

 "No," she said. 

 He took her by the hand and led her out onto his beautifully landscaped patio, handcrafted hard wood chairs and benches were spaced out perfectly around a firepit and inground pool. The early summer air was cool this late at night and Valarie shivered in her tiny outfit. 

 Nelson hugged her to warm her up and to feel her up at the same time. He felt her breasts through the soft material, then inside it. He pinched her nipples through it, hoping that the material would feel good against the sensitive buds. He cupped her ass and touched the part of her upper thigh exposed by the slit in the mini skirt. He kissed her on the mouth, their tongues intertwining, their chests pressed together. Valarie ran her hands over his hard chest, loving the feel of his muscles. She grabbed his ass, pleased by its firmness and obvious strength, which would add power to his thrusts. 

 She closed her eyes and moaned as he kissed her neck and pushed the top of her dress aside, filling his hands with her breasts. She felt his palms on her nipples, rubbing them ever so gently. She nibbled on his ear and felt his cock surge against her thigh. He was one of those guys, huh, she thought? Loves to have his ears licked. She made a mental note. 

 He was sucking on her nipples now, his hands moving down, reaching under her skirt, grabbing her ass, following its tempting curve right to her pussy, which welcomed his fingers with a warm, wet kiss. 

 She wondered about neighbors being able to see or hear, but it was pitch black outside the ring of light from the patio lamps. She wasn't even sure if there were other houses nearby or if anyone was in ear shot. Not that it mattered now. Nothing was going to stop this from happening and she didn't care how many people watched. 

 She let him lean her against the outdoor bar. She put her hands on it and leaned over slightly as he hitched up her skirt and entered her from behind, his cock sliding easily into her pussy. He reached around and cupped her breasts again, a bit more firmly this time. He thrust into her with force and power, but also control. Just like he was at work, at a banquet or anywhere else, Nelson always seemed in control. And here, now, his cock was the master, a benevolent ruler, to be sure, but a powerful one as well. It commanded her pussy with long, deep strokes that gave her immense pleasure. Hail to the king and his mighty sword, she thought to herself, thinking she might bow to him and kiss his feet if he made her cum yet again. 

 She didn't expect it to happen, though. The chill air had sapped her mood momentarily and she was only now working back up. Surely, he would finish before she reached that point. But Coco was right. Nelson had amazing stamina and he got what he wanted. He wanted Valarie to cum and willed his cock to make that happen before it could rest. He played her pussy like a violin, sawing his cock back and forth, making beautiful music with her lips and clit until the happy tune finally ended with Valarie shuddering to a climax. As soon as she recovered, Nelson spun her around and pushed her to her knees, painting her face with his cum, his cock creating a masterpiece with broad strokes across her nose, eyes and cheeks. Some of his "paint" spilled into her hair, adding streaks of white to her raven-colored locks. He was careful not to get any on her clothes, however, because this was one outfit he wanted to see again. 

 "We bought this in white, black and silver, too," Valarie said, as if reading his mind. "I'm glad you like it." 

 "I like everything you bought, everything you do," Nelson said. "But you said you really appreciated all I bought for you. Are you sure you've thanked me enough?" 

 "I'm just getting started," Valarie smiled devilishly. She dropped her top and skirt on one of the deck chairs and walked naked toward the house, wearing only her heels and his cum. 

 "I'll be damned," Nelson muttered to himself, shaking his head. "Hottest little slut I've ever scene." He trotted after her, ready to play with his toy some more.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 03 ****** bydlsloan© Chapter Three: Hot Wheels 

 Valarie and Nelson had sex three more times that night, napping in between. Valarie rode him once, took it doggy style another time and lay back and spread her legs wide the third time. She came once more, him three times. They both were wet and sticky and as happy as could be. Valarie didn't think she was falling in love with Nelson, but she sure loved the fun they had together and the fact that he turned her on as much as she did him. 

 She wasn't sure she'd be as attracted to her date for Sunday, though. Travers was a nice looking man for his age and she respected the way he handled himself and appreciated the way he treated her. He was first-class all the way. But still, he was old enough to be her father. "Or my father's friend," she told herself, finding that much less creepy. Still after two fun-filled, sex-filled nights with Roy and Jim, she wondered how Travers would be. Boring? Creepy? Would she be able to get aroused for him? Should she fake it? She knew she wasn't supposed to, but, wasn't that better than the alternative? Despite her worries, she woke up in a great mood. 

 Nelson helped her pick out an outfit to wear for Travers and promised to have the remainder of the items spread evenly between her place and theirs, so there would always be options wherever she was staying for the night. 

 "Hmm, he said he was going to take you car shopping, so you'll want to make a good impression on the sales guy, maybe get a good deal," Nelson said, rummaging through her new wardrobe. "We need something that shows off your legs and ass -- you can bend over the hood or pump the gas, give him a little show. Plus, Travers will love that. He's always gone after the leggy girls." 

 Valarie made another note, telling herself to get on her computer and start keeping a file on the guys, their likes and dislikes. Like Nelson's ear thing and Travers' leg thing. She'd need every edge to keep them happy and satisfied for a whole year. At this pace, they'd be tired of her in a week, she thought. 

 "This is perfect for car-shopping," he said, holding up a tiny little jumpsuit that was checkered black and white like a racing flag. It was full-sleeved and body tight, but the legs ended at the tops of her thighs. A zipper ran from the neck line all the way down to her crotch. Nelson insisted she wear it with no bra or panties. "It's so tight, it will really show off your nipples and your pussy lips," he said. "Plus, it won't be really easy to get out of, even with the zipper, so we need to make sure Travers can see or touch whatever he wants, when he wants." 

 She wore black, thigh-high stiletto-heeled boots and silvery hoop earrings from last night's banquet. 

 "Damn, they might give you a car for free just for walking in looking like that," Nelson said. "Man, I wish you could be here one more day. It's going to be a long wait until Wednesday." 

 "I'll see you tomorrow, Jim," she said. 

 "Yeah, but tomorrow is your day off and Tuesday will just be, you know, something quick in the office. I'm talking about Wednesday, when we can really have some fun." 

 "I can't wait," Valarie said, kissing him on the mouth. 

 She walked out the front door, finding the boots awkward she strode down the walk to Travers, who was waiting in his BMW. 

 "Well, that's certainly a fitting outfit for today," Travers smiled, opening the door for her. "I must say, I can't wait for a trip to victory lane." 

 Valarie giggled appropriately at his lame joke. "Well, gentleman, start your engine." 

 "You seem bright and cheery this morning," Travers said. "I was afraid Nelson might have worn you out." 

 "He tried," Valarie laughed. "But don't worry, I'm in good shape. I'm 100 percent and ready to go for you, sir." 

 "Please, call me Bill," he said. "The dealership doesn't open for a couple more hours. Have you had breakfast yet?" 

 "No," Valarie said. "But I'm starving." 

 He took her to a small diner, not the upscale setting she expected from him, but it was nice and charming in its own way. The food was good and the patrons, mostly older men more interested in talking sports and drinking coffee than actually eating, certainly didn't seem to mind Valarie's presence. She heard them making several jokes amongst themselves about taking her for a test drive, checking her oil with their dipstick and getting a better look at her air bags. The usual frat boy type of humor that some men never seemed to tire of. Valarie wasn't offended in the least. She found it cute and flattering and took it upon herself to give them a treat -- one she figured Travers would appreciate. She excused herself to go the restroom, which meant walking past the group of regulars. Or, in this case, it meant leaning over their table, her top unzipped to her navel, and asking them if they knew where the restroom was. Some were too awestruck to speak and those more aware stalled her, asking why she needed to know, why she hadn't been here before, anything to keep her leaning over in front of them. She looked back over her shoulder and saw Travers smiling as he watched. 

 On the way back from the restroom, Valarie stopped at the old fashioned juke box just outside the kitchen and found a song she recognized, though she wasn't fully versed in American music. She strode back to the table of regulars, hands behind her back, pouty look on her face and asked, "Does anyone have a quarter I could borrow? I really want to hear this song." 

 "Dance for us and it's yours," one of the men said, handing her a quarter. 

 "But of course," she smiled. "I always dance to this song." 

 She put the quarter in, waited for the rock ballad to come on and started shaking her hips, swinging her arms and wiggling her ass to the beat. Slowly, she made her way back to Travers, reaching the table as the song ended. She looked back and saw every man looking at her, some of them actually applauding her little show. The big question was, did Travers like it. The smile on his face and the bulge in his pants told her he did. 

 "Um, sir, I mean Bill," she whispered, leaning across the table toward him. "Is there something I can do to help you with that." She motioned toward his crotch with her eyes. 

 "Later," he assured her. "Now, it's time to buy a car. You can help me with that. I have a feeling we're going to get very good service." 

 "I really can't believe you're going to buy me a car," Valarie said. 

 "Actually, we're not buying it," Travers said. "We do some work with the guy who owns this dealership. To reduce some of his costs, we worked out an arrangement where we would each lease a new car every year. While this one isn't part of the deal, I think they'll be willing to work with us." 

 They pulled into the lot and found that there were already a handful of people doing some Sunday car shopping. Everyone took note when Valarie got out of the car, her flashy outfit and stunning looks drawing every eye from the rows of high-end cars to her own set of hot wheels. 

 Three eager salesmen scrambled toward them, eager not only for a potential sale, but also the chance to get a closer look. Travers stopped them, holding his palm up, "Sorry boys, I deal only with Jacobs. Could one of you get him for us, please?" 

 One of the men scurried away, nearly tripping as he looked back over his shoulder at Valarie. While they waited for Jacobs, Travers and Valarie looked around the lot. Valarie didn't really know or care much about cars -- this was Travers' deal all the way -- so she resumed doing what she knew was her job. She leaned over the hood of the cars, looking at imaginary dents or scratches. She knelt down to peer in the window at the odometer or to read the sticker in the window. She opened a door and leaned in, knowing her ass and legs were on display, sticking out of the vehicle. She knew Travers was watching the whole time and assumed some of the others in the lot were too. 

 As she stood up and closed the door, she turned and saw Travers and another man shaking hands. Jacobs. He was younger than Travers, probably in his early to mid 40s, balding with a bit of a beer belly. He had a friendly smile and firm handshake. 

 "Pleasure to meet you, Valarie," he said. "Bill tells me you need a car. I think we can help you out." 

 "Great, thank you so much," she said. 

 "So, what are we looking for?" Jacobs asked. 

 "I was thinking of something sporty, fast, sexy," Travers said. "Something that fits her. She will occasionally be running errands for us and, when she does, you can bet one of us is expecting her to arrive quickly and take care of something right away." 

 Valarie didn't know if Jacobs understood what Travers was saying, but she sure did. If he called her, all hot and bothered, he expected her to be able to get to him quickly and take care of him. 

 Jacobs nodded, his eyes quickly roving over her body, trying to be discreet. He showed them a few different cars before Travers selected one for a test drive. It was a sporty little convertible. They put the top down. Travers got in the passenger seat, Jacobs rode in back and Valarie drove. It was a stick shift and her legs pumped as she shifted, both men watching her smooth thighs and heeled boots work the pedals. 

 "What do you think?" Travers asked after a few minutes. 

 "I love it!" she said. "It's amazing." 

 "Well, I like it too, but do you mind if I drive for a few minutes? I need to make sure of one thing." 

 They switched places and Travers stunned both Valarie and Jacobs by pulling his cock out of his pants. "Let's see if there's enough head room," he said matter- of-factly, easing the car back into traffic. Valarie glanced back at Jacobs, who was slack jawed. She smiled and bent over, taking Travers' cock in her mouth. She felt it harden and bobbed her head up and down, working it into the back of her mouth. She peeked back at Jacobs again. The man was wide-eyed and touching himself. Valarie was just working up a good rhythm and expecting Travers to put his hands on her head and finish the job when he pulled over. 

 "Jacobs," he said. "You drive now. We need to see if there's enough room back there." 

 "For what?" Jacobs asked, realizing instantly what a stupid question it was. 

 Valarie climbed in first, unzipping her jumpsuit all the way to her crotch. She laid down on the seat and found she couldn't fit. From about mid-calf down, her legs hung over the outside of the car. As they drove off, cars honked at the site of her sexy boots hanging out of the car with Travers visible atop her. It didn't take much imagination to guess what was happening in that little back seat. 

 Travers straddled her chest and she pressed her small, firm tits against the sides of his cock. He ran his cock back and forth over the smooth skin between her breasts, rubbing the head over her nipples. He put his cock in her mouth, straddling her face, and she sucked diligently on the head and licked his shaft. He came quickly, pulling back and covering her face with a load that he had clearly been saving up for a couple days. It coated her lips and nose and eyelids. 

 He sat up and zipped his pants. "Yep, plenty of room," he said. "We'll take it. Let's just add it to our deal, OK?" 

 "I, uh, don't know if I can do that," Jacobs said. 

 "What will it take to convince you?" Travers asked. 

 "Could I..." 

 "No, you can't," Travers snapped, anticipating the question. "But you can jerk off on her, if you want. OK with you, Val?" 

 Valarie nodded, afraid to open her mouth and have the cum slide in. Travers hadn't told her to swallow it yet. 

 "Hell yes, it's a deal," Jacobs said, looking at Valarie, her tight body, her cum-covered face, her eyes sparkling behind jism-coated lashes. He pulled over immediately and Travers took over the driving, taking them back to the dealership. Valarie lay in the back seat, Jacobs straddling her chest now, his hand rubbing his cock just inches above her face. He was stroking it hard and fast and she wondered when the last time he'd had sex was. He sure was hard. 

 The answer was obvious when his cum poured out in bucket loads all over her face. The poor man hadn't gotten off in quite some time. A few days ago, Valarie would have been disgusted by such an inordinate amount of the creamy, sticky stuff on her face, but now, she felt more proud than anything. She had made two men very happy by doing little more than dressing sexy, teasing and giving them a place to shoot their load. All in all, it seemed a fair price to pay for a car like this and Valarie was pleased that she was keeping up her end of the bargain. Everyone was happy. No one was getting hurt. It was fun and exciting. Yes, this lifestyle was crazy, but she was catching on and liking it a little more every minute. 

 Despite her growing acceptance of her role, Valarie still wanted to wipe the cum off her face. But she knew to wait for Travers' instructions. Cum was matted against her eyelashes and she felt it caked on her upper lip, chin and cheeks. She knew there was some in her hair and that the white cream would practically glow in her dark locks. She remained prone in the backseat, afraid to sit up and have cum dripping down her body and whipping in the wind as other cars drove by. 

 Quietly pleased with herself and excited about the car, Valarie's thoughts turned to the rest of the day, wondering what Travers would have in mind and reminding herself to show extreme gratitude for the new car. 

 She wondered what was going on when they pulled up to a corner ice cream stand. Now mid afternoon, it was a warm day and the stand, wisely located near a park, was busy. 

 "Come on," Travers said. "Ice cream, my treat." 

 "Can I..." Valarie stopped herself as Travers' hard eyes told her not to even ask. "Sounds great," she said, trying to put a happy tone in her voice as she slowly raised up. A couple globs of cum hung from her chin, but most had already dried enough in the breezy convertible that it was more sticky than runny. 

 "You'll be fine," Travers said flatly. "Coming Jacobs?" 

 "Already did," Jacobs made a poor attempt at a joke, "but if she's going to walk out there without wiping her face, I might need to again." 

 "Well, just give us another car and it's a deal," Travers said, only half- joking. 

 The three of them walked up to the stand and got in line. At first, most of the onlookers were checking out Valarie's sexy attire. Then when they took a good look at her face, the giggling and pointing and comments started. The camera phones came out and people nudged their friends, pointing to the gorgeous girl in the sexy outfit with white stuff all over her face. It sure looked like cum, and based on how she was dressed and the two men she was with, it wasn't a big jump for most to guess what the little slut had just done. 

 Valarie felt the cum slowly oozing down her face. A drop hung from one of her hoop earrings. She found it difficult to open her left eye, which was well covered by cum. 

 "You order first," Travers whispered to her, his arm around her waist, both to help reassure her and to make sure everyone knew who she was with. "All you ask for is a plastic spoon. If they offer napkins, refuse. Got it?" 

 "Yes, sir," she said softly back to him. Her face burned with humiliation, but she kept her head up. She was not ashamed. 

 "Can I just get a spoon, please?" Valarie asked the young clerk, a high school boy on his summer job who just had been presented with the best story ever to tell his buddies. He didn't even ask if he could take a picture before snapping open his cell phone and snapping one, focusing on the bubble of cum clinging to her upper lip. 

 "Sure, here you go," he grinned. "Mind if I ask what you need it for?" 

 The question caught Valarie off guard. She didn't know what to say. "Um, uh..." 

 "Never mind," the boy said. "I can guess." 

 Valarie turned to walk away, kicking herself for not having an answer. She should have said something about teasing and clever about eating the cream her friend had given her or about cleaning her face. She knew that was the sort of thing the guys were trying to teach her -- to always be thinking about teasing, showing off, giving off that sexy vibe in a shockingly brazen or slutty way. She was glad Travers hadn't heard her stumble. She didn't want to disappoint him. She told herself she'd have to do better. 

 She waited patiently for Travers and Jacobs to get their ice cream and was flattered that Travers bought her an ice cream cone. "You can eat this," he said, "right after you eat what's on your face." They all three sat at a table in the courtyard area of the park and Valarie, aware that all eyes were on her, carefully took the spoon and scooped it along her cheek, gathering a half a spoonful of cum and putting it in her mouth. The bitter, salty taste never agreed with her and she tried to hide her distaste, but Travers noticed. 

 "Still not to your liking, huh?" he chuckled. 

 "No, sir. I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sure I'll learn to like it." 

 "It's OK," Travers assured her. "I'm sure it doesn't taste good. But I like your spirit and attitude. And the fact that you don't fake it or pretend to like it, but you eat it anyway. That's exactly what I expect from you, and I didn't necessarily expect you to be able to do it so quickly. I'm impressed." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said, tipping her head to one side and letting the cum from the earring drip onto the spoon. 

 "Now just because you're off to a good start doesn't mean we're going to take it easy on you," Travers said with a grin. "You're going to keep eating a lot of cum, whether you like it or not. I hope you do, for your sake more than mine. Of course, I'm going to enjoy trying to train you, though. In fact, tonight you are going to have another opportunity to develop your taste for cum." 

 "What's tonight?" she asked, intrigued but also a bit disappointed that the central activity sounded like it would involve her ingestion of cum rather than, say, getting fucked until she had another mind-blowing orgasm. Their pleasure before mine, she reminded herself. I'm here to please, not be pleased. 

 

 "I'll tell you later," Travers said. "Looks like you got most of it. You may use this napkin to get the rest. Leave it in your hair, though. That looks amazing." 

 They sat and ate ice cream, the show dying down a bit now that the cum was no longer evident on her face -- only in her hair -- and the shock of her outfit had worn off. Guys still hung around, discreetly taking pictures and staring at her mouth as it opened seductively and those pretty, full lips wrapped around the creamy white ice cream, her tongue darting out to lap up stray drips. Valarie turned the simple act of eating an ice cream cone into a virtually orgasmic experience for many men that day. 

 After they returned to the car dealership, Valarie followed Travers to his house, driving her car by herself. They drove out of the city into a beautiful suburb about 15 minutes outside of town. There, Travers had a beautiful home right on a lake. 

 As he was showing her around, he told her about his plans for the evening. "I've been playing poker with a bunch of buddies from way back in my army days," Travers explained. "Normally, we play on Saturday, but this week we had to switch to Sunday. I thought about canceling so I could be with you, but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to go ahead and have it. Of course, I want to show you off and we'll find another outfit that will help do that. And, yes, I will probably fuck you in front of them. But I also thought it would be a good opportunity to have some fun with your training to enjoy the taste of cum. Don't worry, you're not going to give blowjobs to everyone. But, you are going to eat their cum." 

 "Oh, my," Valarie said. "Sir, I'm sorry, but I just don't know. I mean, I try... I just don't..."  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 03 ****** bydlsloan© "Relax," Travers smiled. "You remember when you were a child and you had to take medicine and your mom would mix it with ice cream or mashed potatoes or something to make it taste better?" 

 "Sure, I always mixed it in my cereal," Valarie said. 

 "Well, I can see that not liking the taste of cum is becoming an issue for you -- much more you than it is for us," Travers said. "You want so desperately to please us that you want to like it. You're trying too hard, thinking too much. It needs to be less about the actual taste and more about the experience, how having that cum explode in your mouth makes you feel. You need to equate it with good, positive thoughts that make you happy. If pleasing us makes you happy, know that us shooting cum in your mouth is about the best thing there is in a man's world. If feeling naughty makes you happy, focus on that, the image of your mouth on a man's cock, sucking on him, milking him dry. See what I mean?" 

 "I think so," Valarie said. "Sort of like making the taste secondary, a non- issue. I want to taste your cum not because it tastes good but because I like making you cum or because it makes me horny. Something like that." 

 "Exactly," Travers smiled. "I can see why you got all A's. You're an excellent student." 

 "So, where does the ice cream come in?" 

 "Oh," Travers said. "Well, like I said, I want you to associate tasting and swallowing a man's cum with something positive, something pleasurable for you. So you're going to eat their cum with some of your favorite foods. Whatever you like. You can add it to ice cream, chips and dip, hot dogs, soup, hot chocolate, whatever you want tonight. I will probably still feed it to you straight, but you won't have to lick or suck any other cocks -- they'll just jack off on whatever food you want and then you can eat it." 

 "That sounds like a really good way to do it," Valarie said, feeling better about things. "So, how many guys are we talking about? And if I'm not sucking them, how are they going to ... um, you know ... get off?" 

 "There are five others besides me," Travers said. "They're all about my age, within five to six years, anyway. And they will get off just by looking at you, maybe touching you a bit, maybe you'll give a little show, a little stroke with your hands for encouragement, but no sucking or fucking." 

 "All right," Valarie said. "Whatever you say, sir." 

 "You don't have to call me sir," he reminded her. 

 "Oh yeah," she smiled. "I was wondering if you'd mind if I called you 'Billy'." 

 "Why Billy?" 

 "I don't know," she said. "You're just so professional and clean cut all the time and Billy just sounds fun and playful... I guess that's a silly idea, huh?" 

 "Not at all," he said. "I like being fun and playful. I don't feel old, but being with you makes me feel very young. Call me Billy or whatever you want. I won't take offense, just like I know you won't take offense when I call you my slut or bitch." 

 "Of course not," Valarie said. "I know you don't mean anything bad by it. I am your slut, your bitch, your cum receptacle, your little whore, your sweet-to- eat and thrill-to-drill babe. At your service, Billy boy." 

 "You are amazing," he said, giving her ass a playful slap. "Let's find you a nice outfit for tonight, you naughty little tease. How did that old boyfriend of yours ever let you go, anyway?" 

 "Well, I didn't act quite like this back then," Valarie said, realizing that made it sound like years ago when in reality it had only been weeks. What a different woman she had become already. "So, I'm not sure he found me the irresistible playmate you guys do." 

 "All that aside," Travers said, his tone soft, genuine, "you're a bright, fun, smart, talented young lady. Women like you don't come along every day. Now add in the fact that you are becoming an incredible sex object and, well, I just don't see how it happened." 

 "He's doing just fine without me," Valarie said. "I still care about him, but just as a friend. That's all we ever really were. I wouldn't say we were ever lovers. I never thought we'd get married. We just had a lot in common and had some fun, but he had big dreams and a great opportunity to pursue. I miss his companionship -- we could just sit and talk for hours -- but I don't miss him like a lost love. Know what I mean?" 

 "Sure," Travers said. "I know we aren't exactly your friends yet. I mean, we've put sex way ahead of really getting to know you. But I hope in time you'll consider us your friends. I really do. I want you to be able to have fun with us, even if it doesn't involve sex. And I want you to be able to trust us, talk to us, laugh and joke with us. But you're doing it the right way. Get used to the submissive role first by not ever really getting out of it. I know it's hard to go from normal girl to always being in the spotlight, always being viewed as a sex object. Thinking that way, moving that way, acting that way ... it's not second nature to you. Not yet anyway. I think it will become that way and when it does, then you can find that balance between being yourself and being a sex toy." 

 "Yeah," Valarie said. "I really have to think about it when I show off for you ... bending a certain way or wearing my clothes a certain way. I'm not used to doing that. I'm glad you understand. That makes it easier. I don't want to mess up, but I feel better knowing you guys will be patient with me." 

 "Yes, for now at least," Travers said. "But the longer we go, the greater the expectations. I'm sure you understand that. And I feel safe in speaking for my cohorts that the games and fun will only become more extreme, more exciting and more demanding on you. You won't be harmed in any way, you have my word, but there is much more we can do than what you've experienced so far." 

 "I understand," Valarie said. "At the same time, the past three days have been so ... extreme ... to me, at least. I can't imagine it getting any crazier. But I trust you guys to lead me, train me and help me become what you want me to be." 

 "Keep that attitude and you'll be fine," Travers said. 

 The portion of Valarie's clothes that would stay at Travers house had already been put in a spare walk-in closet. Valarie was amazed that the closet was filled. She now had more clothes in four different locations than she'd ever had in one place in her life. 

 "Why don't you pick something out?" Travers said. "I'm going to go down and prepare the game room for tonight. And I want to take a shower. That should give you plenty of time to find a good selection. I trust your judgment." 

 "Thank you, sir, I mean, Billy," Valarie said. 

 It didn't take her long to find the dress she was looking for. She had loved it when Coco picked it out for her. Naughty and fun. She thought it was definitely appropriate for tonight. She remembered that they had purchased four different colors, so she wasn't surprised to find one of them in Travers closet. 

 She selected some shoes and a fun choker that seemed particularly appropriate and laid everything out on the bed. She heard Travers in the shower now. She stripped off her clothes and entered his bathroom, nude. Slowly, she approached the clear glass shower door. His back was turned as he washed his hair. She noticed his ass, which was fairly firm and attractive for an older man. Playfully, she pressed her naked body against the glass, smashing her tits against it. It was quite a site when he turned around. 

 "I was hoping you wouldn't mind if I joined you," Valarie said in sexy high- pitched voice that made her sound bubbly and naïve. "I've been a dirty little girl and I could use a nice hot shower." 

 "You have been very dirty," Travers agreed, pulling her into the shower with him and closing the door. "But something tells me a shower isn't going to make you stop." 

 "Something tells me you're right," Valarie giggled. She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. "Thank you for the car, Billy," she whispered softly in his ear, pressing her lips to his ear lobe, licking his ear and his neck. 

 "It is a very nice car," Travers said softly. 

 "Sexy looking," Valarie mumbled, her teeth scraping against his neck. Her hands caressed his hairy chest. His hands were on her hips, holding her close. She felt him grow hard against her belly and took his cock in her wet, soapy hands, stroking it gently. 

 He grabbed her wet breasts, letting his hands slide over them, cupping them, brushing against her rubbery nipples. She kissed his ear again, then whispered, "I'm all yours, Billy, use me however you want." 

 There was a small bench in the shower and Travers guided her too it. He turned her to face the wall, then put her right leg on the bench. Now, with her left foot flat on the shower floor and her right leg up on the bench, she was spread and open to him. He stood behind her, rubbing his cock against her ass. The warm water continued to spray over them. That, his pre-cum and her preheated pussy were more than enough lubrication to let him slide right into her warm tunnel. She placed her hands against the wall, bracing herself as he pumped into her, her nipples brushing against the slick tiled wall with each thrust. He grabbed her hips and drove his cock up into her, slapping her ass a few times. 

 "Oh, that's a good little slut," he said lustily through gritted teeth. "All wet and hot for me, weren't you?" 

 "Oh yes, Billy," she cooed. "I was so ready for you. Make me your little slut. I can't wait for you to show me off to your friends." 

 "Yeah, they haven't seen a hot little bitch like you before," he groaned, his thrusts growing faster and deeper. "Tight, juicy little piece of ass." 

 "It's all yours," she whimpered. "Use me." 

 "Exactly what you're made for," he said. "Cock-sucking, cum-swallowing, horny little cunt. Oh, fuck that little pussy. Yes!" He pounded her hard, ramming her against the wall and pinning her there as his cum spilled into her. She kept rocking her hips, moving her ass against him, milking his cock with her pussy. She was hot herself, but not on the verge of orgasm, not yet. Travers didn't turn her on like Roy and Nelson. She wasn't repulsed by him in the least, but aroused, well, that was a different matter. She thought she could be, but it would take more time, more intensity. Maybe something would happen with the poker guys tonight. If not, it wasn't about her, she reminded herself. What she had just done, essentially, was her job. And, judging by Travers smiling face, she had done it quite well. 

 After the shower, Valarie was finally free of cum on her face and hair and felt clean, refreshed and energized. 

 "Let me see what you picked out," Travers said. 

 "Not until I put it on," she said coyly. "Gotta see the total picture to get the full effect, big boy." 

 She grabbed her clothes and scurried into the walk-in closet. When she emerged, Travers merely nodded his head and smiled. Mission accomplished. 

 She had picked this one in particular because it seemed fun and playful and it was game night, after all. The outfit was meant to look like a referee, a very naughty referee. A black and white striped halter topped criss-crossed across her breasts and wrapped around her back. Its black strings tied both around her neck and the middle of her back. The top ended at her rib cage with black straps criss-crossing across her midriff. Her skirt was also black, a tiny 4- inch pleated garment that was more tease than clothing, covering less than half her ass cheeks. She wore black and white striped bikini panties that tied in low bows on her hips and thigh-high black-and-white striped leggings that looked like athletic tube socks and were made of the same soft, stretchy material. 

 She wore clear stilettos and giggled at the idea that her six-inch heels were actually longer than her skirt. The final touch, of which she was especially proud given the theme Travers had already identified for the night, was a black velvet choker with a rhinestone "I Love Cum" label across her neck. She even wore a whistle around her neck, playfully blowing it. 

 "That's not what I want you to blow," Travers said. "But you can keep practicing all you want. Wow, that's a great outfit. Perfect choice. You look amazing. The guys are going to go crazy when they see you." 

 "Thanks," Valarie blushed. "I must say, clothes like these do make me feel, well, sexy." 

 "So, have you given any thoughts to what foods you want to eat with your cum tonight?" 

 "What do you guys usually eat?" Valarie asked. 

 "Well, we usually have some chips and salsa or order a pizza or maybe some wings," Travers said. "It's not fancy -- it's a guy thing, I guess." 

 "I understand," Valarie said. "Well, I might just try whatever you guys have. Do you need me to fix anything?" 

 "You fixed what I needed in the shower," Travers said. "No, whoever hosts has no responsibility for the food. The others bring food. I'm sure they'll have a good assortment for you to choose from." 

 Travers told Valarie he wanted her to make a grand entrance. He hadn't told the guys about her, so she would be a huge surprise. "They'll be here in about 20 minutes. So give us until 8:15, then come down to the basement. By then, we'll be playing cards. You can come in and ask if anyone needs anything. I'll be watching the jaws hit the floor." 

 "You're silly," Valarie giggled. She gave him a kiss and waited in his room, taking advantage of the opportunity to get some rest. Being a full-time sex object took a lot of energy -- the past few days had been draining, both mentally and physically. 

 Promptly at 8:15, Valarie made her way downstairs, double-checking her attire, not that there was much to check. She made sure her leggings were pulled all the way up and her choker was facing forward. She descended the stairs to the basement slowly, the voices of the men growing louder with each step. It sounded like a typical guy's night, loud laughter, jokes and talk of women and sports. She took a deep breath, took the last step and entered the basement. 

 "Good evening gentlemen," she said in a loud, cheery voice. "Billy, can I bring you guys anything?" 

 "Sure, baby," Travers grinned, watching his buddies ogle Valarie. "I think we could all use a beer. They're in the refrigerator right next to the bar." 

 Travers had a full bar in his basement, including a full-size, fully stocked refrigerator. The refrigerator stood next to the bar, not behind it. There was no obstruction of the view as Valarie opened the refrigerator and bent to collect the beer bottles. She grabbed two out of the door, but Travers said, "I think the ones on the bottom are colder," he said. 

 "Oh, of course," Valarie said over her shoulder. She scolded herself for not thinking of that to start with. The further she bent over, the better the view for the guys. She just had to learn to think that way. She started to bend her knees, but realized that bending at the waist would be better. Now, her legs were straight, slightly spread, her ass higher than her head as she bent over and grabbed two beer bottles in each hand. 

 She brought them over to the table, trying to make eye contact with each of the men, all of whom were staring at her. She kept a smile on her face. Be pleasant, be friendly, be cute, be sexy, she told herself, tease 'em and please 'em. 

 She placed the beers in front of each man, bending over slowly, letting them look at her chest or ass or legs -- whatever they wanted. When she had handed out all four, she headed back to get the last two. 

 "I'll be right back, boys," she smiled. She walked slowly, putting one foot in front of the other like she had seen the runway models do, knowing that it accentuated the motion of her ass. She bent over slowly again, gathered the two beers and brought them back. 

 "Thank you, Valarie," Travers smiled as he accepted his beer. "Please, meet my friends and contributors to your clothing fund after I take them for all they're worth tonight. That's Hank, Buzz, Nat, Smitty and Bones." 

 Valarie shook all their hands. "Colorful names," she said. 

 "Nicknames from back in the day," Travers said. 

 "What did they call you?" Valarie asked, teasing. 

 "Why, he's Wee Willy," Smitty said. "Was then, always will be. Willy for short." 

 "Willy," Valarie smiled at Travers. "I like it. William is too stuffy sounding. Yes, Willy. That's fun." 

 "Know why we call him 'Wee Willy'?" Bones laughed. 

 "Oh, she knows," Nat said. 

 "Why are guys always so mean to each other?" Valarie giggled. "All I know is, last time I checked, he wasn't so wee." 

 "Oh really? And how long ago was that?" Nat challenged. 

 "About an hour ago," Valarie said, biting her lip temptingly. "I sure didn't have any complaints." She smiled and spun away, stopping a few steps away. "Anything else I can bring you boys? Just yell if you need me." 

 "Hey, Willy," Nat yelled. "Where's she going? I always did think we should have a little waitress on hand for these things. Whaddya say?" 

 "Hey, she's a free woman," Travers shrugged. "If she wants to stay, that's up to her." Of course, Valarie knew he was telling her to stay, but also to play up the fact that she was his sexy little toy by her choosing. Make it seem like I couldn't resist him, like I'm a little slut addicted to his cock, Valarie told herself. She smiled and turned around. 

 "OK, boys," she said, turning around. "I'll hang around. Just didn't think you'd want some silly girl messing up your boy talk. Let me bring down some of those snacks I saw upstairs and turn on some music. Poker's too boring. If I'm going to hang around, we're going to make this a party." 

 She went up the stairs and found a serving tray, loading it with bowls of chips, pretzels and salsa. She heated up the plate of chicken wings someone had brought and found some cheese, crackers and chocolate brownies to add to the mix. She put all this and a few small saucers and bowls on the tray and headed back downstairs, gingerly watching her step, careful of her high heels on the narrow stairs. 

 There was a table along the wall behind the poker table and she carefully set the tray there, bending at the waist as she did so, well aware that no one was actually looking at their cards anymore. "See anything you like?" she asked, turning and waving her hand in front of the tray of snacks like a model on Price is Right. 

 "Hell yes," the one they called Bones grinned, looking pointedly at her legs. 

 "You're so silly," she teased. "I meant to eat!" 

 "I know," Bones grinned again. They all laughed. 

 "OK, OK," Valarie smiled. "How about I just let you gentlemen help yourselves while I find some music. Does this jukebox work?" 

 "Sure does," Travers said. "Find some good dance music, why don't you?" 

 "Just what I was thinking," Valarie grinned. She flipped through the songs on the jukebox, not surprised to see a lot of 70s and 80s rock. That fit Travers' age. She liked rock, too, and recognized many of the songs. She picked a handful of singles, then started moving her hips as the first sounds of classic Bon Jovi filled the room. 

 She turned to face her audience, all of the men standing around with saucers of wings and chips, their eyes collectively glued to her. She smiled and looked down, watching her legs, trying to see what they saw, to move in ways they would want her to. Try as she might to lose herself in the music, she was self- conscious and felt awkward. She understood now why strippers had a pole to hold onto. Besides the phallic symbol, it was also a welcome partner. Right now, with nothing to hold, nothing to move around or in response to, she felt slow- footed and clumsy, even though neither of those words had ever been fitting descriptions for her. A natural athlete and graceful dancer, Valarie was used to fluid, confident movements. She felt anything but right now.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 03 ****** bydlsloan© She stopped looking at herself and looked at the guys, expecting them to be frowning or laughing at her awkward attempts. Instead, they were still gawking at her, their eyes locked to her body, silly boyish grins on their faces. Instantly, she began to relax. She focused on them instead of herself, watching them as she moved, paying attention to how they reacted to certain movements. She remembered Coco telling her to watch them, that their eyes would tell her what to do. Sure enough, she found herself moving fluidly, confidently now, her body jerking and grinding and twisting to the thick beats. 

 "Your love is like bad medicine. Bad medicine is what I need," the song said. She thought it was especially appropriate. Her disease was a slight aversion to cum. And the medicine was a heavy dose of it. Bad medicine? Well, hopefully not. Think positive thoughts, associate it with good things, she reminded herself. She looked at the dorky grins on the faces of men who in other settings were successful, distinguished businessmen and community leaders. She realized she had them in the palm of her hand. She wiggled her ass and their eyes boggled back and forth. She ran her hands over her breasts and they licked their lips. 

 It was fun to see them react this way. Playing it forward in her head, she realized she would be able to make them cum by teasing them just like this. And that would be fun. And then, she could only imagine their expressions watching her dine hungrily on their salty loads of spunk. Travers was right. The fun wouldn't be the taste of the cum. It would be feeling the power she had over their emotions, the pleasure she give them with a twitch of her hips or a lick of her tongue. It was intoxicating. That, she realized, was the addiction. Not the actual taste or substance. It was all about the experience. She felt sexy and hot and powerful and tried to corral and hold that feeling, knowing it was what she had been missing. That was what would make her not just a slut, but a cum slut, a hot babe who enjoyed producing, extracting and, ultimately, being a receptacle for cum. The fun came not from feeling degraded, but from feeling strong and in control. She wouldn't dominate them physically with whips and chains, but mentally by teasing, taunting and ultimately pleasing in the most fun and wicked ways. Yes, she needed some bad medicine all right. 

 "Very nice, my dear," Travers grinned. "But that music's a bit loud. Turn it down a bit, please, so we can continue our poker game. I have some money to win from these chumps. Would you mind keeping the plates and glasses filled while we play?" 

 "Of course not," Valarie chirped happily, but inside she was confused. She thought she had been sexy and sultry. She thought she'd keep dancing, the guys would get excited. She'd strip, they'd jerk off and she'd catch their cum in a bowl or something and try Travers' food experiment. She thought this would please him, but obviously it wasn't what he wanted. Go with the flow, she told herself. He'll let you know what to do when. Just be ready. 

 She turned the music down, still wiggling her hips to "You Shook Me All Night Long" as she played the role of waitress, offering food and beer to the poker players. Travers caressed her ass as she did so, but none of the others did and she realized that they didn't yet feel comfortable touching her and she suspected that it had little to do with Travers' presence -- though that was certainly a factor—and more about their sense of decency. That was probably why she wasn't half-naked right now on the floor with cocks jerking off all around her. But how would they get to the point? Would Travers just blurt it out? Was he expecting her to do it? She looked at Travers for direction, but his poker face displayed as little about his intentions as it did his hand. 

 She decided to wait it out. She watched them play several hands, occasionally getting up to offer food or beverage, but mostly she sat and watched. Travers was indeed doing very well and after his third straight winning hand, she went over to congratulate her hero. 

 "Ooh, you're doing so good, Billy," she cooed, leaning in to give him a kiss. His hand met her lips. 

 "Sorry, babe, no kissing during a hot streak," Travers grinned. "I'm on fire. Can't let anyone -- even you -- jinx it. Nat could use a good luck charm, though." 

 Valarie got it. That was the opening she was looking for. 

 "You better believe it," Nat said in mock disgust. "I haven't had a decent hand all night. Get over here, sweetie. Wee Willy never did appreciate the attention of a beautiful woman." 

 "That's because he never had one before!" Bones joked. 

 "Good point," Nat said, standing and giving Valarie's hand a gentle kiss in a show of mock chivalry. "However did you wind up with such a disgusting pig?" he asked Valarie. 

 "Felt sorry for him," Valarie went along with the joke. "But now I see the error of my ways. How may I help you get your money back, my dear?" 

 "How about a kiss on the cheek for luck?" he asked. Valarie looked over her shoulder at Travers, who gave her permission with a dismissive wave of his hand. But a sparkle in his eyes told her that she was doing well. She took the initiative and sat on Nat's lap and kissed him on the cheek. Instinctively, his arm went around her waist, holding her on his lap as Bones dealt the next hand. Before Nat picked up his cards, he asked Valarie to blow on them for luck. 

 "Careful, Val," Smitty said. "If he wins this hand, who knows what he'll ask you to blow next." 

 "I'll take my chances," Valarie smiled. She leaned over and pursed her lips and blew gently on the cards, taking her time and giving them all a nice look. The tight top really pushed her B-cup breasts together, creating a small but very attractive bit of cleavage. 

 "I think your cards just got bigger," Hank teased. As Valarie sat back, she did indeed feel a growing bulge beneath her. She didn't let on about that or about Nat's cards -- though that part was easy since she didn't really know much about poker. When he won, though, she bounced up and down on him excitedly, turning to give him a kiss. The tops of her breasts jiggled against his chin and she leaned over and kissed him -- on the mouth this time. Nat resisted the urge to kiss back, pushing her gently away and glancing over at Travers, who was busy pretending not to have seen the kiss. 

 "Looks like she's good luck all right," Smitty said, handing Nat the cards. 

 "Hey, babe, would you mind dealing?" Nat asked. "I'm too busy counting my winnings here." 

 "Sure," Valarie said. "But I don't really know how. You just shuffle them like this, right?" She started shuffling the cards, exaggerating her struggles until finally several of the cards flew into the air, one of the landing, as she'd hoped, between her breasts. As she knelt to pick up the others off the floor, she wedged the card deeper into between her breasts so that only a portion of it stuck out of the top. Valarie had never minded having small to average size breasts, but now that she was in this outfit, playing this role, she felt inadequate. She thought about Coco's huge breasts and wondered if they guys would like her more if she got a boob job. What was she thinking? A week ago she would have scoffed at the idea. Now, she feared she wouldn't be sexy enough without it. 

 She pretended not to notice the card wedged in her cleavage and resumed shuffling the cards. When she began to deal, the guys stopped her. 

 "You're missing a card," Smitty said. 

 "What? Where?" Valarie asked, looking on the floor again. 

 "No, it's not on the floor," Nat said. "Here, I'll get it for you." He grabbed the top of the card, his hand brushing across the top of her breast as he slowly pulled it out and handed it to her. 

 "Oops," she giggled, shoving the card back in the deck. She quickly finished shuffling and dealt the cards. She gave Nat another kiss for luck -- this one again on the mouth -- and blew on the cards again. She squirmed in his lap, making sure his growing cock kept on growing. She kept moving slightly and watched the hand play out, trying to think of her next move. She had no doubt that once the first guy got off, the others would see that it was OK and join in. But how to break the ice? Travers was offering no guidance. She was on her own and feeling a bit scared and vulnerable again. Did she really trust Travers, after all? Did she really want to be this kind of girl? She caught herself daydreaming about life back in Scotland, her old job, her family. It seemed so far away right now. How had she gotten here? And is this really where she wanted to be? 

 She snapped to attention when Nat slapped the table and whooped in celebration. Another winning hand. Valarie glanced at Travers to see if he had noticed her lapse, her hesitation. If he did, he didn't let on. Poker face all the way. She remembered the cheer she had thought up and launched into it. She jumped up and down in front of Nat, her tits bouncing in his face, her skirt offering glimpses as it flipped into the air. 

 "Play those cards and grab those chips, Much good luck from my lips. He's got a full house, I've got a firm little pair. Just try to beat us, if you dare. We'll win each hand, you can't last. Nat's the best, so kiss my ass!" 

 Valarie's choreographed dance moves for the cheer included pursing and licking her lips at the mention of her mouth, cupping her breasts when she mentioned her "big pair" and finally slapping her ass at the end. The cheer drew applause and laughter. Amidst the commotion, Valarie caught Travers eye and jerked her head toward the football game that was muted in the background, then hooked her thumb toward Nat's crotch. Somehow, Travers caught her meaning. 

 "Hey, I forgot all about the game," Travers said, looking over at the football game. "Who's winning?" 

 He got up from the table and walked over toward the set. Smitty, Hank, Buzz and Bones followed. Nat started to, also, but Valarie stopped him by reaching between his legs and squeezing his cock. "Shhh," she smiled, looking over her shoulder to make sure the others were focused on the TV. Then, she rubbed her hand firmly up and down his shaft, feeling his hardness through the thin material of his khakis. "It's OK," she whispered to him. "Just relax." 

 He put his hands on her hips and looked uneasily over at the others. Obviously, Nat was concerned that Travers would be upset. Valarie didn't know how to convince him otherwise. That, she decided, was up to how Travers wanted to play it. She was playing her role. Now it was time for him to play his. She'd do the work, he just needed to give his buddies the green light. 

 Valarie unzipped Nat's pants, whispering to him, "For when we sit back down." She could tell he was torn, knowing he should zip them up and stop her, but probably wanting nothing more than to feel her skin or lips or whatever body part she was willing to offer against his sensitive erection. She turned her back to him, using her body to shield the movements of her hand, which was now inside his pants, gently stroking his cock with subtle movements of her delicate fingers. Blocked by her body, the handjob was undetectable to the others, even as they returned to the table, but Nat's cock was certainly well aware of it. He slid into his chair, keeping a hand on Valarie's hip, pulling her close so no one would catch a glimpse of his cock. 

 After a few more hands -- two of which were won by Nat -- it was his turn to deal again. Valarie reached for the cards to shuffle them for him, pulling her hand from his cock, which was now wet with pre-cum. She didn't want to get the cards sticky but she had no where to wipe the pre-cum from her hands, so one by one she licked her fingers clean. The pre-cum didn't have nearly as strong a taste as actual cum and she didn't mind it as much. Still, she knew the real stuff would be coming soon. 

 She shifted on his lap until she felt his cock pressing against the backs of her thighs, then spread her legs just enough to let it poke through. The pulsing prick was being kissed on top by her silky panties while the other three sides were surrounded by her silky smooth thighs. She felt him buck his hips once and looked down to see the bottom edge of her skirt lift up a couple of inches. She knew that his cock was pressed against it. She nonchalantly reached under the sides of her skirt and untied the panties, letting the front flap fall over the head of his cock. 

 Valarie looked around at the table of men, again wondering how she had come to be sitting on the cock of a man she didn't know, surrounded by others she only knew by colorful nicknames and a boss more than twice her age who had already fucked her several times and let another man cum on her face. Now, in just a few more minutes, she knew she would begin the process of eating the cum of these men -- these strangers. She would swallow more cum in one night than she had in her whole life. Hell, she'd had almost as much sex in the past few days as she'd ever had before. More barriers would be broken soon, she knew, absently wriggling her ass. 

 Usually, breaking barriers was a good thing. But she wasn't sure about all this. It was too much, too soon. Sweet, sharp, focused Valarie was becoming something different. But was it better, worse or neither? She wasn't sure. The fact that her options had been limited at the time of her decision to take the job offered little consolation. There was no getting around the fact that she found some of this very exciting, very arousing, highly interesting. She was scared, ashamed, exhilarated and proud all at the same time. It was an odd mixture of emotions and it had her on a roller coaster ride, feeling incredibly sexy and powerful one minute, frightened and vulnerable a moment later, confused and ashamed the next. 

 A few minutes ago, she had been thinking about her need for "bad medicine" and savoring the idea of spurting cocks all around her. Now, it was imminent. Nat wouldn't last much longer. Once he came, it would be on. They'd all be cumming. How much would Travers let them do to her? Did she really trust him that much? He hadn't shown his hand to his friends yet, so to speak. If she jumped off Nat right now and ran upstairs, what would happen? He wouldn't force her to come back down and have sex with them all -- that would be rape and she knew neither Travers nor these men would stoop to that level. No, Travers would punish her some other way. Not physical. Mental. Emotional. He'd fire her, probably. Then where would she be? Sucking landlord dick for a room again? 

 Her options were limited and time was running out. Nat needed release. He was moving more now and it was getting difficult to hide. Travers still wasn't moving. He was going to make her make the move, invite the others. Somehow he'd give them permission and that would be it. It was clear that he intended for her to make the first move, make it look like her idea. OK, if that's the way he wanted to play it... 

 "Who brought the chip dip tonight?" she asked sweetly, pinning her thighs and panties around Nat's cock to keep it still for a few more minutes. 

 "I did," Hank said. "There's ranch and salsa. Take your pick." 

 "Hmm," Valarie frowned. "I think I'd like a different flavor. Something a little salty, nutty, but also thick and creamy." 

 "Sorry, I didn't bring anything like that," Hank said. "How do you make it?" 

 "Oh, you brought it all right. You all did," Valarie grinned mischievously. "Every man knows how to make it -- but it's best when there's a woman's touch." 

 With that, she stood up. Nat grabbed for her, but it was too late. They all saw her pretty panties draped over his erect cock, a telltale wet spot above his head. He looked at Travers nervously, but Travers gave him a smile and a nod, indicating it was OK. 

 Valarie retrieved a small bowl from the snack table and turned back to look at them. "Nat's going to give me some of his dip," Valarie said in sultry voice, barely louder than a whisper. "And while I'm sure he's quite virile, I imagine I'll need more. Can I encourage you to share yours with me?" 

 "Thought you'd never ask," Buzz grinned. "Of course, you might have to be my little lap dog luck charm for a few hands first, just to be fair." 

 "Of course," Valarie cooed. "It's the least I can do. I hope you gentlemen brought a lot." 

 She knelt down in front of Nat and the others stood up, expecting to watch her suck their friend's cock. Travers hadn't told Valarie to do so and she was glad. She didn't know if Travers and the guys would ever want her to be in a gang bang or not, but she sure wasn't ready for one yet. Half-a-dozen hand jobs and some cum eating would be plenty wild enough for tonight. She just hoped that's all it would amount to. 

 She wrapped Nat's meaty cock in her panties and and rubbed it up and down, stroking it firmly, feeling his penis flex as his load worked its way into launch position. 

 "Use your tits," Nat said. Buzz heard him and untied her top before she had even let go of Nat's cock. She thanked him and slid the top off, handing it and her panties to Buzz. Her nipples were hard and she rubbed them against Nat's pulsing shaft. 

 "I'll hold those," Nat said as he pinched her nipples between his fingers, pinning them on the sides of his cock at the base of his shaft. Valarie slid her hands to the sides of her breasts and mashed the firm little buds against his cock. Nat bucked his hips, pumping his cock across her tits. 

 "She's mighty fine," Nat said to Travers. "Sure you want to share this fine piece of ass with degenerates like us?" 

 "What's mine is yours," Travers said. "Well, except for her three holes. Those are private property. No trespassing there, boys." 

 "What's the penalty?" Smitty said, only half-jokingly. "Might be worth the punishment." 

 "Might be," Travers nodded. "So long as you didn't mind having your balls cut off." 

 "Hmm, tempting," Smitty grinned, "but I think I'll stick with the hand and tit job." 

 "Good choice," Travers said. 

 "Shut up you morons," Nat grunted. "Can't you see I'm busy over here?" 

 "Looks to me like that poor pencil's about out of led, old man," Buzz taunted. 

 "Look again," Nat growled. "Get that bowl over here, bitch. I'm going to give you so much cum, it will save you the trouble of jerking these other dorks off." 

 "Mmm, I hope so," Valarie cooed. Nat took over the stroking while she picked up the bowl and held it under her chin. "Just hit my face and it will drop right in." 

 The thought of jizzing on her pretty face was the final image that sent Nat over the top. His wad shot out in four thick streams, each hitting her tightly closed lips. He jerked his cock over the bowl, milking the remaining drops out as he watched his cum drizzle down Valarie's chin and drop into the bowl in sticky puddles. 

 "Beat that, chumps," Nat said, wagging his softening cock up and down, shaking the last few drops into the bowl. "That's enough to feed a small village for a week." 

 "Looks yummy," Valarie said. "But I'll need more. Billy, could you please turn up the music. I wanna dance!" 

 Travers turned up the music as Motley Crue's "Girls, Girls, Girls" ode to strippers came on. Perfect song, Valarie thought, "who wants a lap dance?" 

 The guys didn't bother answering the obvious, but dutifully returned to their seats and watched as Valarie slithered onto the poker table and writhed around, her body twisting and turning to the music. Already topless, she decided she might as well take the next step. She wriggled out of her skirt -- with plenty of eager hands helping discard the garments -- and lay naked except for her thigh-high socks and stilettos. She hopped off the table and straddled Buzz, facing him as she sat on his lap, her naked pussy rubbing over the lump in his pants. She gave him a disapproving look for having his pants still on and motioned for them all to take them off. She faced no resistance.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 03 ****** bydlsloan© When everyone was sufficiently disrobed, Valarie began making the rounds. She would straddle each guy one at a time, grinding on him for about a minute, rubbing her tits in his face and letting her pussy lips barely graze across the tops of their cocks. In between chairs, she'd spread her legs, bend over, cup her breasts -- anything she could think of. Like her previous dance, she felt awkward and clunky at first. These were her first lap dances, her first striptease and these heels were ridiculous. But knowing that she had caused six grown men to have erections at the same time was a powerful, intoxicating feeling, and that feeling of accomplishment, purpose and sultry desire returned. 

 Her movements became smooth, slinky. Her nipples hypnotized, her ass tantalized, her legs mesmerized. From eyes to thighs, she was a vision of pure beauty, grace and unrestrained sexuality. 

 She made the rounds three times, bumping and grinding, using her nipples, breasts, inner thighs, breasts and hands to stimulate those pulsing cocks. The men grew more aggressive, though hardly rough, as the dance continued, cupping her breasts or squeezing her ass. But none touched her pussy or tried to violate Travers' rule. Their restraint was impressive and Valarie appreciated it. 

 As she started her fourth tour around the table, Buzz, gritting his teeth and holding his cock, growled, "bring me the bowl." Valarie grabbed the little brown bowl, the bottom of which was already covered by Nat's cum, and hurried back to Buzz, kneeling before him. She took his cock in her hands and stroked him, keeping one eye on his eyes and the other on the end of his cock. Like Nat, he splattered her face and watched it drip into the bowl. 

 Valarie wanted to wipe it off, but Hank was gesturing frantically and the swollen purplish head of his cock looked about to explode. He had her hold the bowl in one hand with her right breast poised over it. With her hands full, Hank jerked his cock a few times, then sent a shower of white hot jizz onto her breast. The cum tumbled down her gently sloping mound, hung precipitously on the end of her nipple and steadily dripped into the bowl. 

 Three loads down, three to go, she thought. She looked at the bowl, surprised at how much cum was already there. This was going to be quite a meal. 

 Smitty asked her to stroke his balls while he dumped his load and Bones had her lay in front of him on the table, bowl balanced on her belly, while he jerked off into it. That left only Travers, who sat idly with his hands resting on the sides of his chair, his hard cock sticking up. 

 "Care to make a donation?" she teased, showing him the bowl which now held an impressive quantity of semen. 

 Travers didn't say anything as he got up, walked to the jukebox and turned off the music. He returned to his chair, sat down and smiled up at her. 

 "Now you may suck my cock," he said flatly. 

 "Of course, sir," Valarie said, sensing that he wanted to be in total command now, show his authority. Billy didn't sound right. "Do you want to hold the bowl?" 

 "I don't need the bowl," he said. "Mine goes straight down the hatch. Like I said, gentlemen, ownership has its privileges." 

 "Why'd you turn off the music?" Buzz moaned. 

 "So you could hear this girl suck cock," Travers said. "Impressive suction power, let me tell you. Show them, my dear cocksucking slut." 

 Valarie wasted no time following his orders. She took him in her mouth and began slurping hungrily on him. 

 "Damn, she must like that taste," Hank said appreciatively. "Sure she wouldn't like to try the sampler platter?" 

 "Your dick got as close to the inside of her anything as it's going to get," Travers chuckled. "You'll just have to take my word that she's damn good at this. And yes, I do believe she likes the flavor of a good cock. However, cum is a different story." 

 "I can tell she's good at it, I don't have to take your word for it," Smitty said. "But what do you mean she doesn't like cum? She just practically begged us to give her a bunch to eat. Seems to me the little vixen is a born cum slut. Reminds me of that little Army nurse who show us all how much she appreciated our service to our country. Remember her?" 

 "Who could forget?" Buzz said. "Her body was just average, but her mouth was made to suck cock. About like this little bitch here. You sure she's not a cum- hungry babe?" 

 "I swear," Travers said. "Oh, don't get me wrong, she's game. She swallows every drop," he patted the back of her head like she was a good dog. "She doesn't like the taste much. I'm trying to train her, help her appreciate the joy of a mouthful of my spunk. So, I figured the best way was practice and creating a positive experience to relate it to." He held his shaft in his hand and slapped his cock against her puckered lips and soft cheeks before shoving it back in her mouth. "We're all having fun, that's a good start. Two, she can try it on some good food. Makes it taste better, like medicine, but also helps her start associating a mouthful of cum with positive experiences and reactions." 

 "So why don't you let her eat yours with some food?" Nat asked. 

 "Because my pleasure is more important than hers in this case," Travers said. "I'm just being a nice guy trying to make it better for her." 

 "Heart of gold," Nat joked. 

 "You know it," Travers said, patting the back of Valarie's head, which continued to move up and down steadily in his lap. "I'm too nice for my own good. I really want to just take the back of her head like this, shove it down on my cock like this, and choke her with it. But I'm not that guy. So, I let her have her fun too. She really likes licking dick, but she knows that leads to the part she doesn't like. Catch 22, you might say." 

 "Yeah, that's a real dilemma you got there," Smitty said. "They ought to give you a medal for being so damn nice as to help this poor girl overcome her irrational dislike for a mouthful of sperm." 

 "I know," Travers grinned. "And yet all I get is a blowjob. Oh well, the things we do for charity. Speaking of, I think it's time to make my donation." 

 He put both hands on the back of her head now and took over dictating her rhythm and depth. She relinquished control of her head and mouth to him and let him use it as he wanted to finish the job. Soon enough, his cum was spurting into her mouth. Before she could swallow the bitter stuff, he stopped her. "Don't swallow," he said. "Keep it in your mouth. Let my sperm wriggle around on your taste buds for a while. Get used to it. Find a flavor in there you like and savor it. You just gave me a great blowjob and us all a great show. You're doing great. It's a fun evening. That's right, you have a mouthful of cum and you're still having fun. It can happen. See? Give me a smile. Show me how much fun it is!" 

 Valarie forced a smile, then started laughing as cum began dribbling out of the corner of her mouth. 

 "Shit, you're going to make her waste it, man," Nat said. "Next thing you know she'll be laughing so hard she'll have it coming out of her nose." 

 Valarie laughed harder now, struggling not to lose the load in her mouth until Travers said it was OK. She was stifling her laugh like a giggling schoolgirl in trouble with the teacher. And just like a giggling student, the more she tried to stop, the harder she laughed. Finally, she took in a deep breath, trying to relax. Instead, she felt the cum enter the back of her throat. She tried to stop it from going down and, just as Nat had predicted, it went up. She felt it tickling her nasal passage as she coughed and sputtered and cum flew out of both her mouth and nose at the same time. 

 She saw everyone else laughing too and laughed harder, dropping to the floor and rolling around, vaguely aware that her hair was likely picking up specks of the cum she had just spit out. She felt ridiculous and dirty and incredibly happy. Finally, she stopped laughing and caught her breath and got back up with the help of Nat and Bones. 

 "So, you had Wee Willy's little mini sausage link for an appetizer," Bones said. "Are you ready for the main course?" 

 "Mmm, I think so," Valarie nodded, rubbing her belly for effect. "That didn't quite fill me up. Know where I can get some more?" 

 "I know just the place," Bones said. "And we just cooked up a fresh batch for you. Go ahead and help yourself. It's an all you can eat buffet. If that bowl gets empty, I bet we can give you a free refill." 

 "Yummy!" Valarie squealed, only half-acting now. Her inhibitions had all but disappeared during this crazy evening and she was fully into her slutty character. She'd probably regret it later, but right now she was ready to be a cum slut. Or at least try. 

 "I thought you guys came over to play cards, not play with yourselves," Travers said. "I've got some money to win back. Come on. We can watch her eat while I take your money." 

 With everyone fully dressed again -- except for Valarie, who remained in only her heels and thigh-high leggings -- the game resumed while Valarie started looking over the food options, debating what to try with her side of jism. 

 She put a few chips and pretzels on her plate, a saltine cracker and two brownies. "How about whoever wins this hand gets to help feed me a few bites?" Valarie suggested, surprising herself with the confidence in her voice. Normally she would have meekly waited for them to tell her what to do, but not tonight. Had she really changed so much so fast? Or was this the woman she was always meant to be? She wasn't sure which prospect was scarier. 

 Bones won the hand and welcomed Valarie into his lap, putting his arms around her waist, his hands resting on her bare hips. "Wow, that looks nasty," he said, eyeing the bowl of creamy white cum. "Can't say as I blame you for not liking the stuff, but there's nothing hotter than a cum-hungry slut, so I have to take Wee Willy's side on this one. I want to see you eat that stuff. So, what's it going to be first?" 

 "Chef's choice," Valarie smiled. "You cooked it up, you serve it any way you like." 

 "Well, the way I'd like has been outlawed by our host," Bones grinned. "But I suppose nothing beats good ol' jizz and crackers." He took a spoon off the tray and scooped some of the cum onto a saltine, using the back of the spoon to spread it around. "Open up." 

 Watching Bones spoon out the cum onto cracker turned Valarie's stomach. She didn't have mood swings nearly this dramatic during her period, but in a flash she had gone from cum slut wannabe to timid, scared girl again. Cum on a cracker? She didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She just didn't want to throw up, but that felt like a very real possibility right now. She knew Travers would be very disappointed if she did. She had come so far -- if you considered learning to be a sex toy a major accomplishment -- and she didn't want to fall back now. Remember why you're doing this, she told herself. Not to be a slut. Not to be anyone's whore. You're doing it to ultimately be independent, get a degree and a great job. Two years from now, this would all be worth it. Just chew and swallow, she told herself. Chew and swallow. 

 Valarie reluctantly opened her mouth, closing her eyes. When she felt the cracker on her lips, she bit down, immediately feeling the sticky dampness that gave the crackers such a unique texture and an even more unique taste. Cooking with Cum wasn't going to be a Food Network show any time soon, that was for sure. She tried to hide her distaste and hold back her desire to spit it out. The wet cracker just dissolved on her tongue and bits of it stuck there. She needed a drink to wash it down, but the guys were chuckling as she chewed and chomped and made faces, trying to scrape it off her tongue and teeth. 

 "Sorta like peanut butter crackers, huh?" Buzz laughed. "Really sticks to the roof of your mouth, doesn't it?" 

 "Mmm-hmm," Valarie said, forcing another swallow. She looked at the bowl, hoping that half of the stuff was gone. But it didn't look any different. She realized that Buzz had only put a little on the cracker. Wow, what a difference just a little had made. What was that commercial, "A little dab'll do ya"? Valarie was sickened at the realization of just how much more she had to eat. And disappointed that the cracker had actually made it worse. She realized that the chips and pretzels would work the same way, dissovling into sticky cum- coated crumbs that stuck under her tongue and between her teeth, ensuring that the flavor lasted a long, long time. 

 "Taste better that way?" Travers asked. 

 "No," Valarie said, keeping her oath to be honest. "But there's a lot more in there. Let's keep trying." 

 "That's the spirit," Travers said. "Come on, next winner serves." 

 Valarie finished the cum cracker while they played out the next hand, then moved over to Hank's lap as he raked in his winnings, then cupped her breasts. 

 For the next half an hour, they took turns feeding her cum-dipped crackers, chips and pretzels. They shared their beers, letting her wash it down, adding the possibility of getting drunk to her worries. It wasn't tasting any better and her stomach continued to churn. The alcohol only made her dizzy and lightheaded. She wanted to lay down and go to sleep. Tomorrow was her off day. She needed it so badly. 

 She didn't know if Travers sensed her growing fatigue or increasing unease or if he just wanted to see white cum on brownies, but he finally spoke up with a way to bring an end to the cum buffet. "Looks like we still have a nice helping in there," he said. "I vote we see how it works as frosting and put the rest of it on those brownies. Sweety Val deserves a little treat for all her hard work, don't ya think?" 

 The guys agreed and Travers poured the remaining semen over two thick chocolate brownies, using the spoon to make sure none of it dripped off the sides. A little of the cum clung to the spoon and he put it in her mouth to clean it off. 

 "Enjoy your dessert, my dear," he smiled. 

 Valarie sunk her teeth into the first brownie, anxious now to finish off the rest of the jism and thankful to finally be tasting something sweet with it. The sweetness definitely diminished the bitter taste of the cum. It was both the worst brownie and best cum she had ever tasted. It was all in how you looked at it. 

 When it was finally all gone, the guys applauded. "Well done," Travers nodded. "Now, you know, I'm in the mood for something sweet too. Did you guys know that Valarie here is sometimes called Sweety Val? And that the reason she's called that isn't because she's so nice? It's because her pussy tastes like candy, honey and sugar, all rolled into one." 

 "You don't say," Hank said. "You know, I consider myself a bit of a purveyor of pussy, a connoisseur of cunt, you might say." 

 "Ha, you don't even know what purveyor means," Smitty chided. 

 "Maybe not, but it sounds good," Hank said. "And whatever you want to call it, I know good pussy when I taste it. So, I know we said no fucking, but do you mind if I have a little taste, Bill?" 

 "You know what they used to say in school," Travers said. "If you bring a treat, bring enough to share with everyone. Dig in, fellas." 

 Before she knew what was happening, Valarie was on her back on the table, her legs over Hank's shoulders, his mouth pressed against her pussy lips. He licked deep insider her and she felt her pussy, turned off by the cum fest, begin to stir. The man knew how to use his tongue. Maybe he really was a connoisseur of cunt. 

 "Could someone please pass the pussy," Smitty said. He was sitting next to Hank, who reluctantly pulled away and helped slide Valarie across the table. Smitty's tongue replaced his. 

 "She sure is mighty sweet," Hank said. "What's she do, soak that think in a vat of honey every night?" 

 "I don't know," Travers said. "But I could make a meal of that every day." 

 Valarie heard their comments and it turned her on. She had no idea what made her pussy taste good to men or what made one pussy taste different from another. All she knew was that they all seemed pretty excited about licking her and that certainly wasn't always the case with men -- they would always rather receive than give when it came to oral sex. But these guys sure were eager and she was quickly experiencing another mood swing. No longer sick to her stomach and fearful, she was now excited to have completed her task and was quickly warming up to the lapping tongues. 

 By the time they'd each had a taste, her hard nipples, wet pussy and trembling thighs were the signs they all needed to know that they were getting to her. As they started round two, it was no longer a taste test -- they were determined to get her off. They certainly had her full support. She was using her hips and thighs to move her pussy around and hump their mouths and tongues. She was glad that Travers had not allowed them to fuck her, but a naughty part of her lusty brain secretly wished they would just start fucking her and not stop until they each made her cum. She also wished they were all like Nelson, sexy hunks with limitless stamina. She focused on that image, a roomful of Nelsons holding their hard cocks, ready to take turns pleasing her pussy. 

 She didn't know who's tongue was inside her when she finally came, but she felt the others join in the frenzy, sucking her nipples, fighting over her pussy, licking her neck and her thighs while she rippled and trembled through a powerful series of orgasms. When she was finally done, she lay on the table, exhausted. 

 "Hmm, I think you're going to need to have that table cleaned," Smitty laughed, looking at the puddle beneath her. 

 "Yep, and I think the party's over -- at least for you guys," Travers said. "Me, I'm going to take her upstairs and party some more. Let yourselves out. If you hear the walls banging, think nothing of it." 

 They all laughed, but knew it was true. Travers was going to do exactly what they all wanted to do -- take her upstairs and screw her brains out at least one more time. The drunk, horny girl was wet, willing and exhausted. Her lean, limber body would be flexible, totally vulnerable, ready to be ravaged. Travers slung her over his shoulder, her wet cunt looking them each in the eye as he hauled her off, his cock growing harder with every step.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 04 ****** bydlsloan© Chapter Four: Sweet Heat 

 The next morning, Valarie awoke with a slight headache and a stale taste in her mouth. She rolled over, aware that she was nude. She tried to remember what happened after Travers had taken her upstairs at the end of the party. She had visions of him humping her furiously while she drifted in and out of consciousness. For an older man, he had a lot of energy. She rolled over slowly, realizing he wasn't in the bed with her. She saw a note on the night stand and read it. 

 "Went to work early this morning. Take the morning off. See you this afternoon. Realize we haven't given you any cash, so here's some for breakfast or whatever. Thanks for being a good sport last night. Billy." 

 She sat up and counted five $20 bills. She felt a pit in her stomach. She felt dirty and tired and like she'd been used. All for $100. What had she turned herself into? 

 She showered, brushed her teeth and put on a yellow thong, some tight denim shorts and a pale yellow t-shirt. She wanted to put on sweat pants, a sweatshirt and some regular panties and bra. But she realized those "regular" clothes would be back at her hotel room -- the guys were only going to keep specialty clothing at their places. Well, she'd dress a little more normally when she got home and maybe that would help bring her out of her funk. 

 The sight of her shiny new car parked outside helped a little, though she still felt guilty about tucking the $100 in her tight pockets. Did taking it make her a whore? And had she really earned it? She didn't think so. She felt like she'd let Travers down last night. She hadn't become a cum slut and she had practically been unconscious the last time he fucked her. She hadn't yet mastered walking or dancing in extreme high heels, she struggled to keep her poise and appearance in the front of her mind at all times. And she had never before doubted or resented the size of her average breasts the way she did now. 

 

 A few weeks ago she had been a confident, happy young woman with a sweet boyfriend, loving family and options aplenty. Then, her boyfriend left, she made a rash decision to start fresh in a new country and so far, as much as she liked the States, she'd not been able to figure out a way to live that didn't involve her trading sexual favors. She felt like a failure and, oddly, what disappointed her the most was that she didn't feel like she was living up to the expectations of Travers, Nelson and Roy. 

 "You're a stupid little bitch," she chastised herself, driving fast on the expressway, the cool morning air offering a chilly ride with the top down and so few clothes to insulate her. She told herself to stop feeling sorry for herself. She wanted to blame Sebastian, the landlord, the guys at the firm for her decisions, her failings. But it was all her fault. She knew she and Sebastian wouldn't be together forever, so why had she clung to him for so long? She could have figured out other options for her apartment. She kicked herself for giving into the dirty landlord too easily. And she didn't have to accept the offer at the law firm. So far, they had stuck exactly to what had been agreed upon. They had made it clear what they expected of her and how she would be treated. She had been fucked and shown off publicly, but not harmed. And they had backed up what they had said about fine clothes, plush accommodations, a car, dinners, etc. If she had made a poor decision, it was her fault, not theirs. She had fooled herself into thinking she didn't have options. She had been drawn in by the promise of working for a big firm. She had loved the promise of the comfortable lifestyle. And, yes, she was attracted to them and excited at some level about being a sex object. Didn't every woman long for that status at some point in their lives? 

 She sped to her hotel and went upstairs, anxious to change into some sweats and spend the rest of the morning huddled on the couch watching bad TV. She looked through her closet and drawers but could find none of her old clothes. Then it hit her. They had gotten rid of them. All that was left was her new sexy, slutty, revealing clothes. She flopped on the bed and lay back, closing her eyes and clearing her head. 

 "OK, think Valarie," she said to herself. "You have to make a decision and whatever you decide, you better commit to it." She grabbed a notepad and pen and started jotting down her thoughts and feelings, eventually boiling everything down into a few key points. If she was going to leave, she needed to do it today. She owed them that much. If she was going to stay, she needed to commit to it, get over her apprehensions and shame and fears and be the slut they wanted her to be. 

 Suddenly, it hit her. That was the problem. She didn't know how to be that sexy girl they wanted. She was trying to be too much too soon. That was making her feel inadequate and her resentment made her feel used. Ahh, those crazy mood swings. She understood now. All Travers and the others had asked of her -- over and over again -- was that she have an open mind, obey commands, give it her best and, above all, be honest. That last part was the one that had been tripping her up. She'd had moments of honesty when she'd admitted not liking cum or being worried about certain public displays. But she hadn't been completely honest with them. She needed to tell them that she felt awkward at times, that she still didn't like the taste of cum and doubted she ever would, that she was self-conscious about her breasts and that she worried that being a slut would make her less of a lawyer. They weren't asking her to be more than they felt she was or could be, so why should she. Let them train you, she told herself. Let them be disappointed from time to time. Make them show you what they want and how they want it. Don't try to anticipate every little thing. 

 The more she thought, the more she realized she had already made her decision. She was staying and her mind was now working on accepting that it was OK to be reluctant and vulnerable at times. Going from good girl next door to naughty teasing sex tart was going to take time. She now realized what the guys had known all along. 

 For the first time in days, the knot left her stomach, her head stopped buzzing and she felt clear-headed and alert. I can do this, she told herself, and if I can't, no one will be able to say I didn't give it my best shot. 

 Feeling suddenly energetic and excited, Valarie threw on a pair of tiny pink athletic shorts, a tinier white tank top and some tennis shoes and headed to the gym a few blocks away. The guys had provided her with a membership and she went in intent on working off some stress while keeping her body toned and lean for them. She made a mental note to ask them about setting aside a few hours every week for this so she could be at her peak physically for them. She was sure if she phrased it that way they would agree to it. 

 She ran five miles on the jogging track and did a series of light weights, sit- ups and stretches. She was halfway through her workout before she realized that guys were looking at her. Her tiny shorts revealed that she was wearing a thong and her little tank top displayed her firm nipples. She had already grown accustomed enough to wearing tight, revealing clothing that it hadn't dawned on her that this outfit was certainly more inviting than average, even in the era of short shorts and sports bras. Her skin was slick and shiny with sweat and she was bending her flexible body into some pretty enticing positions. She wondered what they thought of her. Did they think she was too flat-chested and tomboyish? Did they think she was cute? Did they think she looked like a slut? 

 She smiled back at some of them and said hello to those who addressed her. A couple hit on her, but she politely told them she had a boyfriend -- not mentioning that she actually had three. 

 Before she left, she looked in on a few classes, noting that Pilates looked like fun, as did some of the aerobic dance classes. She wouldn't mind swimming a few laps in the pool, but worried that her barely there bikinis and scandalous slings might get her kicked out. 

 She went back to her hotel room to shower and get ready for an afternoon of work. She felt refreshed, both mentally and physically, and looked forward to a few hours of work with no sex involved. She wasn't sure what she'd do after work, but a few hours of solitude sounded good. She might take that $100 Travers had left for her and treat herself to a massage. That sounded like a great start to the evening. 

 She arrived at work in a great mood. She was wearing a black leather mini skirt with a zipper that ran straight up the back. The skirt came down about two inches past her ass cheeks, several inches shy of reaching the black thigh-high stockings she was wearing. She wore a black thong underneath. On top, she had on a simple white blouse that wouldn't have garnered much attention except that it was too small, the tails reaching only her belly button and the tight top making her breasts look larger than they really were. She took advantage of the opportunity to show a hint of cleavage by leaving the top two buttons undone. A sexy outfit, indeed, but tamer than she would probably wear most days at work and certainly more conservative than her "date" attire had been so far. 

 "You seem like you're in a good mood," Nelson said. 

 "Yeah, she doesn't have to suck your ugly prick today," Roy taunted. 

 "Whatever, it's nice to see you so chipper," Nelson said. "Any special reason? Bill told us that you gave a very valiant effort to become more appreciative of the taste of cum." 

 "Well, he was being kind," Valarie said. "I did try, yes. But I feel like I failed him. I'm sorry, Billy." 

 "No problem," Travers said. "I'm not the least bit disappointed. But if you think I am, why are you so happy?" 

 "Because I finally realized what was going through my head and what I need to do," Valarie said. 

 "Oh?" Travers asked, raising an eyebrow. 

 "Don't worry," Valarie said. "I'm not leaving or anything. But I did think about it. I thought about a lot today. I don't know if you noticed, but I've been having some ups and downs with this whole thing. It's been ... a lot to adjust to. And I'm sorry if I have disappointed you or been moody or anything." 

 "Hmm," Travers chuckled. "Funny you say that, because we've been talking about you a bit this morning and we felt like we owed you an apology, too. We compared notes, agreed that you seemed happy at times, overwhelmed at others. We realized we had forgotten this was all new to you. We're used to dating women who, quite frankly, approach us in many cases and make it quite clear how the date will go. A little money and a nice suit can get some women into bed in a hurry." 

 "But what we realized," Nelson picked up the conversation, "was that those girls were mostly one-night stands and we were always anxious to do everything in one night, realizing that there wouldn't be others." 

 "Our mistake," Roy said, "was that we rushed you the same way. We got so excited, we forgot we have you for a year -- assuming you're still on board with the whole plan -- and that you weren't the kind of girl who has a history of jumping into bed with men you barely know. Sexy, yes, but vastly experienced, no." 

 "I'm sorry," Valarie said meekly. "I tried to be the girl you wanted, but I ..." 

 "No, that's not it at all," Travers interjected. "You are the girl we want. We didn't want the girl who has already experienced everything and uses sex to get what she wants and feels like it's all she has to offer. We just forgot you weren't that kind of girl. But you're who we want. A young women with intelligence, confidence and the ability to be an asset to this firm. Those are the hard parts, honestly. Training you to be a slut, for lack of a better word, is the easy part. You have the body and the attitude. Now all you need is the knowledge, which will give you confidence." 

 "Huh, I doubt I'll ever feel as sexy as you want me to be," Valarie frowned. "I can't even get the hang of walking in those heels." 

 "Let's look at it another way," Travers said. "You're very confident as a student, right?" 

 "Well, yes." 

 "And you know you have what it takes to be a lawyer or just about anything you want to do, right?" 

 "Yes, just about." 

 "Well, we see that confidence in you, too, and we realized that there were reasons you weren't as confident when it came to the sexual parts of your job. One, you doubt your appearance, which is ludicrous to us. Two, you doubt your ability to tease and please -- it doesn't come natural. You can't just open up a book, read about it and pass some test." 

 "Oh my gosh," Valarie said. "That's exactly right. This is so out of my element. I mean, put me on a soccer field and let me go. Give me a literature exam and I'll nail it. Ask me to give a report and I love it. But this is all different for me. It's not the sex that bothers me. I rather like that part - - well, most of it." 

 "We get that now," Nelson said. "So, we think we have a way to help you. First off, relax. We love you. You're doing great, so don't be so hard on yourself. Believe me, if we're disappointed, you'll know it. Second, we want you to look at this as more of a training than a role. Just like you'd train for a job or study for a class. We realize that's how your comfortable, that's how you learn. So, you're now officially enrolled in How to Be a Sweet Slut 101. You will have regular assignments and homework and tests. You will be evaluated and graded and your progress will be charted. In the end, you will see that you are far better at this than you give yourself credit for." 

 "Wow, I never looked at it that way," Valarie said, a faint smile on her lips. "I like that idea. I mean, you're right, that's how my brain functions. I have to study things, think about them, analyze them and then come to conclusions." 

 "That's why we came up with this plan," Travers said. "Roy, will you please take her through it? Nelson and I have a conference call." 

 Nelson and Travers excused themselves and Roy sat at next to Valarie's desk and showed her several documents that had been emailed to her. He showed her an Excel grid that had been set up to track her accomplishments on a weekly basis. 

 "We're going to have all of this set up on an internal web site by the end of the day, but for you now you can start with these forms," Roy said. "We want you to track how many orgasms you induce. There's a column for each of us, including yourself, as well as a 'miscellaneous' for other guys besides us. Now, we expect you to not only use this form, but also to build on it as you see fit. Maybe you want to track how many times we cum in your mouth or in your pussy. Or maybe you want to track how many times other guys hit on you or how many times you think about sex during the day." 

 "OK," Valarie said. She liked working with numbers like that. She wasn't sure how it would help her feel sexier, but she was happy to go along with it. "What else?" 

 "We also want you to keep a daily log of your experiences," Roy said. "We have set up this internal blog for you to use. You can post your thoughts, ask questions, post videos and pictures of yourself. You get the idea. We won't always spend much time asking you what you think or how you feel about certain things. This will be your chance to share your ideas and opinions without repercussion. The only thing we ask for, again, is honesty." 

 "All right," Valarie said. It was hard to argue with them -- honesty certainly didn't seem like an unreasonable request. 

 "Now, every Monday we're going to require you to give a report on your week's experiences. We want to know what you did and what you learned from it. I encourage a dynamic presentation with video and pictures -- they definitely make it more interesting and will help your evaluation." 

 "I see," Valarie said. "I'm happy to do all of this, but, I'm worried about having enough time." 

 "We thought of that," Roy said, clicking another document. "We're working on a new new schedule. We'd like you to take a look at it and offer your suggestions based on how much time you think you need to complete your tasks both in and out of work and still have some time for yourself." 

 "Wow, you guys have done all this today?" Valarie said. 

 "Most of it," Roy said. "Like I said, our computer guy is putting it all on a secure intranet site for us. He's a little curious about it, as you might imagine." 

 "Sure," Valarie giggled. "Not exactly typical lawyer documents. You know, if I need to do anything to help make sure he, um, keeps it secure, well..." 

 "He hasn't asked yet," Roy said. "But it's good to know if he starts hinting that you're willing to play along and do what's best for the firm." 

 "Of course," Valarie said. "Anything within reason." 

 "That's all we ask," Roy smiled. He left her to play with the schedule and the forms and joined Travers and Nelson on their conference call. Little did Valarie know that the three high-level lawyers were on the phone with a very high-level client -- a doctor with limitless cash, limitless ego, limitless libido and a very checkered past. The name Dr. Frederick Pound wouldn't mean much to Valarie, but to the women of south Florida, he was legendary. To some he was pure evil. To others, he was the answer to their sexual fantasies. An inventor and scientist as much as a doctor, he had used his genius to create a couple of wonder drugs -- one which made his cock grow to a ridiculous 12 inches and another which made him constantly horny, able to produce erections and huge loads of sperm in a matter of minutes. His lust was insatiable and his fucking was relentless and savage at times. 

 He had a clean record in Miami, but prior to moving there, while still in his trial stages of inventing new drugs, Dr. Pound had gone too far too fast with a few of his patients. There had been complaints -- all from parents and girls chastised by jealous boyfriends, it turned out -- and investigations but, thanks largely to the expert legal work of a then relatively young lawyer named William Travers, Dr. Pound had never been formerly charged or convicted of any wrongdoing. Still, he had found it wise to move from Baltimore, one to get away from the scrutiny and two, to go to the "Land of Plenty", as he called it, referring crudely to the vast amounts of beautiful young women living and visiting the south Florida area. 

 Travers and Nelson had grown to know the man over the years. They didn't much approve of his tactics or his ego, but there was no denying Pound's genius, wealth or loyalty to them for their legal help. And there was no denying that no man on earth knew more about the female anatomy than Dr. Pound. That's why they were talking to him now, listening as he explained exactly how to use the little device that lay before them on Travers' desk. 

 "Since this is my prototype and you gentlemen are testing it for me," Dr. Pound said, his deep voice booming through the speakerphone, "I have taken the liberty of naming it after your young lady friend. I believe you referred to her as 'Sweety Val'. Well, you're looking at 'Sweet Heat' or the 'Val Pal,' if you prefer. I like Sweet Heat, personally." 

 "That's a good name," Travers said, conscious of the constant need to stroke Pound's ego. "How's it work?" 

 "Well, what you have here, gentlemen," Pound said dramatically, "is the first device guaranteed to generate female arousal, monitor that arousal and work as a gps -- I call this version the Get Pussy Satellite -- and the best thing is that it can be implanted and will not need to be removed or replace for years. 

 "There are actually two parts," Pound said. "The one that looks like a watch battery goes just inside the vagina, on the top, as close as you can get to the g spot. It's a painless procedure. The sticky substance on the back is non- toxic and it will hold to her inner lining, no matter how wet she gets or how hard you fuck her. The device has tiny vibrating fibers that are invisible to the naked eye and aren't felt by the patient, but they actually act like tentacles that will gradually imbed themselves in the soft lining of her pussy. So, by the time the adhesive wears off in a couple of weeks, it will be fully encased inside her."  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 04 ****** bydlsloan© "Amazing," Travers said, no longer needing to patronize the twisted doctor. This was truly incredible stuff. Travers was disgusted that the doctor didn't put his genius to greater use for the greater good, but the man was as egotistical and selfish as they came. His wealth, his intellect, virtually his every thought were poured into finding new ways to maximize his sexual pleasure. The man was an addict, no question. Travers was sickened by Dr. Pound, but also in awe of his creations, including this one. "How do you do the um, installation?" 

 "Simple, just give it a gentle push -- unless you like an excuse to get a little rougher -- against the inside of her pussy," Pound said. "You don't have to mash it. It will stick just fine. Won't hurt her a bit. Now, the second piece will cause a little discomfort for about a day, but no real pain. After that, she won't even know it's there -- until you zap her with the remote." 

 Travers held up the small silver bead that looked like something you might see worn as a nose ring. 

 "You just take that little ball and push it against her clit. It will help if her clit is engorged and aroused. Hit the 'implant' button on the remote. That triggers a tiny needle that will inject itself into her clit. Yes, she'll feel a little prick. If she wants to feel a really big one, send her down here," Pound laughed at his own sick joke. The others did not. 

 "From there, the ball acts much like the device in her pussy and will become part of her body. It's much less invasive or painful than a tattoo or piercing, so don't feel like you're hurting the poor girl." 

 "So, what does the little button do?" Nelson asked. 

 "The button in her clit becomes the receiver and primary transmitter," Pound explained. "It will transmit constantly, so you can find her via the tracking system on your computer or the remote anytime, so long as she is within 20 miles of you. It will also provide constant monitoring of her pussy - - temperature, moisture level, state of arousal and yes, even climax. It receives this information via signals from the device in her pussy. It can also send signals to that device. Specifically, if you want to get her warmed up for you, you have three buttons on your remote and also available via your computer. These signals work on a much shorter frequency and you need to be within about 200 yards for them to work. But you can signal the device in her pussy to vibrate and/or heat up. You can do the same with the device in her clit." 

 "I see those controls," Travers said. "What's this 'Talk' button?" 

 "That's the best part," Pound said proudly. "Hit that and the devices talk to one another via a series of fast or slow -- you choose -- electrical blasts that she will be able to feel. They won't hurt, but they will feel like little jolts of electricity. Zap those at the right time and watch her cum, boys." 

 "Damn," Roy said. "That's incredible. You sure it won't hurt her?" 

 "Positive," Pound said. "I tested it on a few of my more adventurous ladies here and they loved it." 

 "I thought you said this was your prototype," Nelson said. 

 "It is," Pound said. "I've tested the components individually, but never combined the gps with the other parts nor had the computer tracking system in place. You're test the first complete version." 

 "Do you plan to sell it if it works?" Travers said, well aware that the mysterious doctor had never sold his other inventions even though they would have sold millions. He had never been driven by money -- always had plenty of it. His inventions were solely for his own pleasure, until now. 

 "Nah," Pound said. "I just like the idea of seeing how many of these hot little cunts down here I can stick one of these in. Track every pussy in town. Maybe herd them all together and zap them all at once -- just a big pile of bitches all cumming at once. Yeah, I think I'd like that." 

 "You're a very disturbed man," Travers said, surprised at how aroused he was by the doctor's twisted fantasies. "But I sure like this product. I think it's exactly what we need. Your price still the same?" 

 "Yep, hardly any price at all," Pound said. "I'll be able to download and track the same information you do from here. That will give me a baseline to compare to my girls here -- see what works, if different girls respond better or worse to different levels of stimulation, etc. Imagine customizing a Sweat Heat device for each girl. Eventually I want to expand the device to include breast and nipple and ass stimulators, but one step at at a time. So, your work with Valarie will be very helpful. And for my enjoyment, I would like to watch the implanting of the devices via a video conference. And send me a few pictures of her as well, if you would please." 

 "You got it," Travers said. "We're going to implant it in the morning. We'll call you then." 

 "I thought we were going to do it now," Nelson said after Travers hung up the phone. "Why are you waiting?" 

 "She seems to have had a breakthrough overnight," Travers said. "I want to let her keep feeling good about that and get used to her new schedule and work load. Plus, I want to give Jay time to get the web site up so he can just add this tracking database to it. And mainly because it's her day off and I don't think I can put this in her, watch her cum and then not want to fuck her. In fact, Roy, I know tomorrow's your day, but you might need to share at least a quick blowjob at some point during this implanting process." 

 "No problem," Roy said, partly because he wasn't about to argue with his boss and partly because he knew the man would be fair in terms of how he used his time and Valarie's. He would return the favor to them both at some point, no question about it. 

 "Man, that Pound guy is a major prick," Nelson said. "You sure we want to deal with him on this?" 

 "I've never liked dealing with him," Travers said. "I didn't have a choice years ago. Now, I suppose I do. But it's my job to set personal feelings aside. As much as I dislike him, I don't believe he's ever done anything illegal. And I really do think this will be a good thing for Valarie. She loves to learn and study. I think she'll get off -- literally -- on the idea of having her body studied in such intimate detail. And personally," he said, toying with the little remote, "I can think of a lot less interesting video games than 'Make the Office Slut Cum.'" 

 "Agreed," Nelson said. 

 "So, how's she doing with the new workload and schedule?" Travers asked. 

 "She seemed to like the ideas," Roy said. "I left her with the new schedule and told her to take a look and make suggestions." 

 "Good," Travers said. "I haven't had lunch break yet. Roy, have Val go get us some lunch. We'll eat in here and go over the new schedule while we eat." 

 By the time Valarie called in their lunch orders and walked to the diner and back, Jay had come by to show them the new intranet site. Realizing that Jay would have more than a little question about what was happening, Nelson and Travers filled him in, including the implant. It took only a few minutes for Jay to incorporate access to the data from the Sweet Heat implants into the new site. Anyone stumbling on the site would be met by a blank page asking only for a user name and password. Only Jay, Nelson, Travers, Roy, Valarie and Dr. Pound would have access to it. Once you entered the page, you were met with a slideshow of Valarie in the various outfits Travers had photographed her in during her private fashion show. 

 Menu bars on the side included options to view or upload additional pictures, view or upload videos, access the SweetHeat page and view or update Valarie's schedule. Valarie would also have access to update her personal blog and weekly report -- the others could only view it. Nowhere on the site were any of the men or the law firm mentioned. Even in the weekly reports and blogs, Valarie would be required to refer to them by initials or code names only. This, they believed, would help safeguard them if someone did happen to hack into the page. 

 "Really important that this all stays quiet, huh?" Jay asked, his intentions obvious. 

 "Yes, Jay," Travers said. "May I assume that your trust can be secured with a few privileges in addition to your pay?" 

 "Whatever you think is fair," Jay said. Jay was a young computer whiz in his early 20s, but he looked and acted older than his years. Tall and slender with thin glasses that made him look smart rather than geeky, Jay had already developed a well-earned reputation for loyalty, trustworthiness, discretion and professionalism. As such, he made a killing off of small law and accounting firms like these who had high-end clients but little need for full-time computer assistance. By excelling at his work and maintaining an impeccable reputation, Jay had a four-star list of clients. He wasn't about to spill the beans on whatever these guys were up to with their intern. They knew that as much as he did. So offering up Valarie was more of a thank you than a bribe, which is why Jay never asked for terms or conditions and never would. Their offer would be fair, he would accept and enjoy whatever they gave. And, judging by the pictures he had seen so far, any time with Valarie would be a very nice gift indeed. 

 He got his chance to see her in person a few minutes later when she scurried back in, her long, athletic legs filling his view as she approached the conference room, lunches in hand, perky breasts jiggling, smile lighting up the room. Jay just looked at Travers and gave him a subtle nod as if to say, "Well done, I understand now." 

 Valarie smiled at Jay as she walked in and quickly set the lunches down on the table. She didn't wait to be introduced. "Hi, I'm Valarie," she said, extending her hand and noting that Jay looked her squarely in the eye as he took her hand and introduced himself. 

 "Jay is our computer man," Roy said. "He has the new site all set up. We invited him to stick around for lunch so he could show us how everything works." 

 "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't get enough lunches," Valarie said, starting for the door. 

 "No, no," Jay waved his hands. "I've already eaten. Thank you, though. I might just get a bite of something sweet later. I like your accent, by the way. Scottish?" 

 "Yes, thank you," Valarie said. She took a seat and dug into her salad. They were in the conference room all seated so they could see the large flat-screen monitor on the wall. Jay was using this to demonstrate the new site to them. Right now, the screen was the blank login page. Moments later, once he had logged in, Valarie nearly choked at the site of her R-rated slideshow scrolling across the page. 

 "Now do you see how beautiful you are?" Nelson asked her. The question caught her off guard. While her initial reaction had been repulsion and fear and disgust, Nelson had called her beautiful. Not sexy. Not slutty. Not a hottie. But beautiful. Is that really what they saw in her? She hoped so. 

 "I don't know," she said. "I've never seen myself like that before. Never seen myself dress and pose like that. I mean, my god, look at that. My ass is hanging out and I look like a whore." 

 "For what it's worth, I think you look beautiful too," Jay said. "Certainly not like a whore." 

 "Thank you," Valarie said, her eyes still not believing what she was seeing on the screen. "No one else can see this, right?" 

 "Not unless they have a password," Jay said. "And the only people who do are in this room. Feel better?" 

 "A little," Valarie said with a mock pout, her cute little nose scrunched up, her sultry lips sticking out. Jay was beginning to wonder how these guys got any work at all done around here. She was distracting just sitting still. Jay's eyes kept wandering to her as he demonstrated how to upload videos and pictures, then showed Valarie how to use her login to update her Excel grids, schedule and blog. 

 "While we're here, did you have thoughts about your schedule?" Travers asked. 

 "Yes," Valarie said. "I actually have a new one on my computer. Jay, can we upload it?" In a matter of seconds, Jay had the new proposed weekly schedule on the screen. He had a good idea of what was going on, Valarie trading out some sex for whatever -- big money or a job or whatever. But when he saw the calendar pop on the screen, he began to get a truer idea of just what level these guys were operating on. They had this hot little babe's every minute accounted for, her time and -- he assumed -- her body assigned to one of them at virtually all times. 

 Jay took Valarie's seat while she stood before them, all ass and legs and sweet hotness on display, her sparkling eyes meeting theirs. Her appearance said sex toy, her eyes and posture and poise said confident young woman capable of addressing a room of powerful suits with a strong, effective voice. She might as well have been talking about stocks and bonds as her revised office slut sex schedule. 

 "As you can see," she began, her back and legs straight, showing them her curvy profile as she looked up at the monitor, "I haven't changed any of your days. Roy would still have Tuesday and Friday, Jim on Wednesday and Saturday and Billy on Thursday and Sunday. Monday would still be my day off, so to speak. I think that works because I can tell that weekends are going to be particularly, um, busy. 

 "To that end, I would propose that every Monday be like today and start with the morning off. I found that time today really helpful and I'm sure I will continue to need that time to rest. I would then come in at noon, finish my weekly report and present it at 3 p.m. After the report, I would leave for the day. 

 "On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays I propose set workout times. Since most of you seem to enjoy the early morning, um, activities, I propose that my workout time be from 5 to 7 those nights, which includes my time to travel to and from the gym. I know that will cut into your time those evenings, but I feel that the added benefits of my fitness, energy level, endurance and flexibility will more than offset the loss of time. I welcome your thoughts on that matter." 

 "I'm all for it," Nelson said. "It's good time for you and there's no doubt it benefits us as well. I would like to consider looking into a personal trainer who could customize a routine that would maximize your workouts for both your benefit and ours." 

 "Great idea," Travers said. "I've actually heard of a woman who could help us with that. I'll make some calls. Go on, Valarie." 

 "I would also like to build in an hour every morning to accomplish two things: one, give you the opportunity to inspect my appearance each day -- my clothing, my posture, body shape, hair, makeup, you name it. And two, to update my daily log and statistics while the events of the previous evening are still fresh in my mind." 

 "Well thought out," Travers said. "I would also like to have you critique yourself, your own appearance. I think it will be interesting to see how we view you in different ways. I see you have 'soccer' labeled there on Monday evenings. What's that for?" 

 "Well, I love to play soccer and I found a co-ed league that plays on Monday evenings -- outdoors this time of year, indoors in the winter," Valarie said. "I would like to play in it, with your permission of course." 

 "Of course you may," Travers said. "When's your first game?" 

 "I'll sign up this week and then I guess I'll start as soon as a team needs an extra player," she shrugged. 

 "Well, I think your schedule is thorough and thoughtful," Travers said. "I see no need to change anything. Gentlemen?" Nelson and Roy both shook their heads. Valarie nodded and took her seat as Travers stood up and took the floor. 

 "All right, the last item we need to cover is Sweet Heat," he said. 

 "I saw that on the web site," Valarie said, nodding toward the site that Jay was now pulling back up on the monitor. "What is it?" 

 "It's this," Travers said, holding up the two small silver buttons and the tiny, fit in the palm-of-your-hand remote. "It's a new invention by a brilliant but somewhat twisted doctor. He's performed small, random tests on it and it's safe, but you will be the first extended test subject." 

 "Test subject?" Travers noted that her tone was inquisitive, interested, not wary. 

 "Yes," he smiled. "We know you like to study things, analyze them. So, in addition to your own observations in your log and reports, you will also receive hard data -- and hopefully some significant pleasure -- from this device." 

 Travers explained how the pieces would be implanted and the remote could stimulate her, all the while, data about her body would be downloaded to this new site. 

 "Amazing," Valarie said. Her mind was racing again. She had felt so good about the new reporting procedures and self-analysis. Now this? It was incredible stuff and she liked the idea of being able to study her own body so intimately, but this also felt invasive, permanent and a little risky. Her tummy felt queasy again. 

 "Now, there are a couple of other pieces you need to be aware of," Travers continued. "One, this doctor -- his name is Pound -- will have access to the data and also wants to watch us implant the devices via videoconference. Two, Jay here is being entrusted with a great deal of information -- information that none of us want to get out. We pay him well for his services, but sometimes special services justify a bonus." 

 Valarie glanced at Roy, recalling that he had tipped her off to just what that bonus might be during their earlier conversation. "I understand," Valarie smiled at Jay, trying to hide her nervousness. "If there's anything I can do to properly reimburse Mr. Jay, I will be happy to do so, with your permission, of course." 

 "Well, we all understand and respect that it's your day off from sex," Nelson said. "So, we will do the implant tomorrow morning. There might be, um, extra services required of you at that time, not only by Jay, but all of us. It promises to be quite stimulating for us all, if you can imagine." 

 "I understand," Valarie said, putting on her best brave face. She knew they had done this and the new reports and everything in an attempt to ease her mind. It was sweet, really. She tried to focus on that and the positive vibe she had been feeling just a few minutes ago. This was all part of the new plan. Nothing to be nervous about. "I will do my best. I'm really excited about all of this. The new site, the reports, the Sweet Heat device. I think this is exactly what I need. Thank you all so much for helping me." 

 Jay shook his head in amazement. This girl was offering her body in every way imaginable to them and she was thanking them. Damn. He wasn't sure how he was going to make it until tomorrow. He had never wanted a woman so much. His cock ached with desire. He couldn't wait until Tuesday morning. 

 Valarie left work around 3, being given the rest of the day off to relax, shop, do whatever she wanted to do. She was shopping at one of the local malls trying not to think about the implants that would soon be part of her body when her phone rang. It was Roy. "Hey, it's your day, so you can say no if you want, but I have a favor to ask," he said. 

 Valarie rolled her eyes. Geez, he was going to get a blowjob or whatever he wanted in the morning. Couldn't he wait? 

 "No, it's not what you think," he laughed. "Look, you remember Travers said he heard of a personal trainer? Well, he made some calls. She's available tonight if you want to meet her. Travers has already signed off on covering all costs. She ain't cheap, but she's supposed to be good and really personalizes workouts to your needs. Apparently, she's, um, well-versed in the sort of exercises we have in mind." 

 "OK," Valarie said. "I'm curious now. I already worked out today, but I can do another one."  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 04 ****** bydlsloan© "Well, I don't think this will be much of a workout," Roy said. "More a first meeting, maybe getting a baseline on your strength, flexibility, endurance, you know, stuff like that, then working on a plan." 

 "All right," Valarie said. "When and where." 

 "7 o'clock. She does it out of her own basement," Roy said, giving her the address. "Her name is Cori Banks. Supposedly she's doing some work with some high-end clients. She's new in town, but making a quick name for herself. Someone with a lot of money is funding her right now, Travers says." 

 Valarie finished her shopping trip, then went back to the hotel and put on a workout outfit -- a black thong, pink athletic shorts with the waist band folded down, a black tank top and white tennis shoes. The shorts showed off the bottom curves of her ass and hugged the valley between her legs tightly, outlining her pussy lips which were split by a g-string. The tank top had been cut at the top and the tear descended deep between her breasts, revealing the inner curves and barely covering her nipples. She wasn't worried about coming across the wrong way. She was sure Travers had found some sort of sex-exercise specialist. Hard to imagine such a person existed, but leave it to Travers to find one. She drove to Cori's house, a nice looking home in a quiet suburb - - not as fancy as any of the homes the guys had, but certainly a quality home in a good neighborhood. Like Roy said, someone -- either Cori or a backer - - had some money to spend. 

 She knocked on the door five minutes before seven and the door promptly swung open. Before her was a gorgeous blonde with perhaps the best body she had ever seen. Cori Banks was simply stunning. Many women paid a lot of money to try to look like her, but Cori didn't look like she'd had any work done at all. Her hair looked natural, her golden skin had a natural tan and her blue eyes and bright smile were genuine. Her curves were impressive, but her breasts didn't have that bloated, balloon-shaped look that many fake ones tended to. They looked real under her white tank top. Valarie noted that, like her, Cori was wearing no bra and her tank top showed off her impressive, toned flat tummy. Her legs were long and lean and athletic and she imagined many a man had done a double take at her shapely ass, encased now in a pair of tight gray shorts. Valarie noted that Cori looked ready to work out -- hair in a ponytail, tank top, athletic shorts -- except that she was also wearing about 4-inch stiletto heels. 

 "Hi Valarie," Cori said warmly, stepping back to let her in. "I'm Cori. It's very nice to meet you." 

 "Nice to meet you," Valarie smiled back, shaking her hand. "You have a beautiful home. And you're beautiful too." 

 "Thank you," Cori blushed, and Valarie wondered how such a stunning woman could be so obviously humble. "You're quite attractive as well. I can see why your company values you so much." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "Well, I charge a bit more than the average personal trainer," Cori explained. "I serve a fairly elite group of clientele. If they just wanted you to stay in shape, they'd pay your health membership and rent you a $50 per hour trainer. But they value you much more than that. They want your body to perform at its peak. That's why they hire me." 

 "Well, it will never look like yours," Valarie said, feeling slightly intimidated. Just when the guys had her half believing how beautiful they thought she was, they sent her to this beauty? Models and movie stars had nothing on this woman. 

 "Don't be silly," Cori said. "Please, have a seat. If you don't mind, I'd like to just talk for a while -- get to know you a bit and let you get to know me. That will help me determine the best way to work with you. Then, if we're both still comfortable with what we're doing, I'll get some baseline numbers on your current condition. Sound good?" 

 "Sure," Valarie said, sitting on the light brown leather sofa in the living room. Cori sat across from her on a matching leather love seat. 

 "Now, this might sound egotistical, but I have found that it helps people to relax and trust me more if I share my story with them first," Cori said. "Not because I'm anything special, but because I've had a unique series of experiences that have led me here, and I'm finding that many of my clients can relate to my story. OK with you?" 

 "Of course," Valarie said. 

 "All right," Cori said. "First off, I'll tell you that I'm 25 years old and single. I grew up in a small town in Georgia, went to college for a couple years, ran out of money and ended up working in a body shop in my hometown. That's where this all started for me and I realized that sex could be fun. It could be dangerous. It could be prosperous. And, it could be controlled by me as much as any man. 

 "Now look, I don't think I'm anything special, but I know men find me attractive. Not something I brag about. Just the way it is. I used to think it was just because there weren't many girls -- hell, people -- where I grew up, so eventually the guys found some reason to want to screw every girl in town. But when I saved the body shop by, for lack of a better description, becoming the company slut, I knew I was onto something." 

 Valarie's eyes bugged when she heard "company slut" and she leaned closer. Cori just smiled in response. 

 "I suspect you find yourself in a similar position," she said. "And I want to hear all about it, but let me tell you more of my story first. I worked out a deal where I had sex with all of the men I worked with. In exchange, they paid for most of my bills and gave me a job. I dressed extremely sexy at work and flirted with every man who came in the door. We eventually sold pictures and calendars and, well, the business took off. My, um, skills were put to use to help land a couple of particularly large accounts. One of the guys I worked with turned out to be a first-class jerk. The other three are like family to me and I'm still close with them all today. 

 "My step-father got sick and my mom didn't care enough to help him," Cori continued. "He lived alone in San Diego and ran a restaurant and I went to help take care of him and his business. I hated to leave the shop, but I felt like I had done about all I could do and I had responsibilities to help my step- father. Unfortunately, he turned into a bitter, horny old man and, well, I couldn't stay long." 

 "Oh dear," Valarie said. "I'm so sorry." 

 "It's OK," Cori said. "Taught me what I needed to know about him. I met a very nice man out there who helped me and I ended up going on a much needed vacation in a tropical paradise. 

 "I know this is getting tedious, but bear with me. All I wanted to do there was relax, then go back to my boys at the body shop in Georgia. Now, I don't know if I bring this on myself or if it's fate or what, but somehow I got into another mess. I made friends -- innocent, no sex -- with a staff member who helped show me around. Sweet, sweet man. Well, three arrogant pricks took notice of me, then of my friend, and saw an opportunity. Either I do what they want or they file complaints and get this poor man fired. What would you do?" 

 Cori didn't wait for an answer, but Valarie knew they shared a kindred spirit. She would have done the same thing, she imagined. 

 "Well, I spent the rest of my vacation playing games with these bastards, but lo and behold, one of them turned out to only be half a jerk," Cori said. "Oh, he got everything he wanted from me just like the others, but he also saw some potential in me and helped me get a full scholarship to a very good school down the coast. His buddy was one of the university leaders and I ended up doing a lot of things for him and the school -- made them a lot of money, but I also got an education. I did an internship at a sports marketing firm. I earned my grades and degree by hard work, nothing else. That's what I'm most proud of." 

 "You should be," Valarie said. 

 "Thank you. Well, anyway, I got out and started thinking about what I could do, where I could go. Again, before I could map out my own plan, life led me here about a year ago. A long time ago I put together a workout regimen that helped me meet the demands that were being place on my body every day. I needed endurance, flexibility, core strength. There aren't a lot of exercises that simulate having your legs behind your head, a cock in your mouth and a cock in your pussy. Sorry if I'm being too blunt, but ..." 

 "You're not," Valarie interjected. "My story will reassure you." 

 "I assumed so," Cori smiled. "So, anyway, I did my own exercises my own way. It turns out there is a market for this -- high-priced call girls, adult entertainers, models, trophy wives, ambitious coeds. And either they or their male benefactors have the funds to pay for private sessions and a regimen geared exactly to what they need. If a girl can't do the splits or put her legs behind her head, I can help. If she can't deep throat, I can help. If she needs to trim her waist or strengthen her legs or make her ass more firm, I can help." 

 "And you do all of this out of your home?" 

 "Yes, I have my basement set up with all the equipment I need," Cori said. Then, anticipating Valarie's next question, added, "I still have some financial supporters, but I intend to be my own boss soon. I envision a whole line of exclusive fitness facilities serving three different markets: the adult entertainers, coeds, interns, etc. looking to get ahead on their looks; the trophy wives and girlfriends sent by their boyfriends and husbands and men." 

 "Men?" 

 "Oh yes, men. Imagine a health club for men only where all the staff were young attractive women. Women who would lead yoga classes in thongs and heels or would do jumping jacks in front of you with no bra while you walked on the treadmill. Women who would give full massages to help you wind down after your workout. How much do you think a guy would pay for a membership to a gym like that?" 

 "Any amount you asked." 

 "Exactly," Cori smiled. "It's a dream, but I think I can do it. Even have the name picked out -- Bar Belles. Get it?" 

 "Yeah, I like it," Valarie laughed. She really liked Cori a lot. She was so sweet and humble, but also honest and smart and independent. She understood why men swooned over her everywhere she went and tried to take advantage of her. She was happy to see that Cori had seemingly emerged unscathed. 

 "So," Cori said. "Does all that blah-blah-blah help you feel a little more comfortable about why you're here and sharing with me exactly what you need me to help you with?" 

 "Oh yes," Valarie said. "My story isn't nearly as long or intense as yours, but I think it's a similar story so far." 

 Valarie told Cori about Sebastian, moving to the States, her nasty landlord and her current deal with the law firm and the guys there. Cori listened attentively the whole time. 

 "So, I'm not really sure what I need as far as exercise," Valarie shrugged. "I mean, endurance and flexibility, like you said, but I'm also afraid I'm not as attractive to them as I want to be. Not sure there's an exercise to help with that, though." 

 "Well, don't be silly about the attractiveness thing," Cori said. "You're beautiful, and obviously they think so too or they wouldn't have picked you or being doing all this. Now, I did talk to Mr. Travers just a little bit and he said they are all wild about those legs and that ass, so he wants to make sure we maintain that and then just do what we can to keep you flexible yet firm. He also said you commented that you feel a bit awkward at times, particularly when you're dancing or in your heels." 

 "Yeah, I just feel clumsy instead of sexy," Valarie said. 

 "No problem," Cori nodded. "We can work on that. From now on, please bring a pair of heels with you -- whatever size you normally wear. For today, I'd say we're about the same size, so let me see if I have something you can wear." 

 Cori brought Valarie a pair of 4-inch stilettos that matched her own except that these were black whereas Cori's were clear. She led Valarie downstairs and Valarie saw that she did indeed have an impressive workout area. It resembled a regular gym in that there was a treadmill and an elliptical machine, an exercise bike and a few weight machines and benches. But there were several other contraptions Valarie didn't recognize and along the far wall were not one, but two stripper poles. Mirrors lined all four walls and a sound system pumped thumping dance beats into the room. A computer and desk sat in one corner and Cori went straight to this, pulling up a file labeled "Valarie." 

 "OK, we're going to start with a baseline assessment -- height, weight, measurements, flexibility, endurance, strength and a few other things you won't find on your normal physical fitness test. From there, we'll see where you need to maintain and where you need to improve. You'll come back tomorrow and I'll have a plan ready to go. Sound good?" 

 "Sounds great!" Valarie said. 

 Cori began by recording Valarie's age, height, weight and measurements. She tested her flexibility -- Valarie could do the splits and put her legs behind her head, but she struggled to put one leg straight up in the air and keep her balance, especially in the heels. She was able to lay on her belly and grab her ankles behind her back without any problem, but found it difficult to hold the position for a long time. On the other hand, she could bend over at the waist and grab her ankles and hold the position for long periods of time. Getting in these positions, Valarie understood why one of the guys might want her to do so and why she might be there for a while. Cori knew what she was doing all right. 

 Valarie's overall leg strength was good, but her arms needed a bit of work. "Have your hands tied above your head for a couple hours or have to jerk off three or four guys at one time and you'll see why arm strength is important," Cori explained. "We won't test your endurance today, but tomorrow we'll put you through a rotation of exercises and get an idea for how long you can go. I'm sure you've already had the all-nighters. Those can wear you down, especially if you do them two or three days in a row. You're very fit, but we'll do our best to take you even farther and make you an iron woman." 

 For the deep throat test, Valarie handled a 9-inch dildo just fine, but 10 inches and above was a struggle. "Those big cocks are out there," Cori said. "I recommend any women in your position be able to take up to 12 inches. It's all about mind over matter and muscle control. Sound like Yoga? It should." 

 "Yoga for cocksuckers?" Valarie giggled. 

 "Yeah, that's pretty much it," Cori laughed too. "It sounds funny, but it works. Makes those guys who try to choke you with their eight inchers or want to stuff their balls in your mouth a little easier to handle too." 

 "Can I ask you something?" Valarie said. Cori nodded. "Do you still like sex?" 

 "You mean, because I have had so much of it and some of it has been somewhat against my will? Yeah, I love it. Absolutely love it. I started the whole thing at the body shop because I loved the attention, loved the power of controlling men's thoughts, manipulating them with a simple bend or twist. Makes you feel beautiful and powerful and, well, wanted. I absolutely love teasing and pleasing men. Do you?" 

 "I don't know," Valarie said. "I mean, yes, I love pleasing them, but I'm struggling with the teasing. When I bend over and show them my ass while I pick up a pen, I feel silly instead of sexy. Know what I mean?" 

 "Sure," Cori said. "That's totally natural. It just takes time. You have the body for it and that smile and those eyes must drive them crazy. You learn to suck on your finger like you didn't plan it but just wanted to wrap those pouty lips around and, oh my, I didn't know anyone saw me -- you master that expression, you'll have them melting for you. That's when you have the power and the fun and you start to see it all for what it is -- a lot of silly role playing that is harmless and beneficial to everyone involved when you get the right situation." 

 "I'm just trying to get through a year, then I'll see what happens," Valarie said. 

 "Well, it might only be a year, but remember, men are always going to want to fuck you, so even if you aren't working there a year from now, someone else is going to be chasing your hot little tail," Cori said. "So, learn what you can now. You never know how it might help you later on." 

 The next morning, Valarie got to work an hour early. The guys had asked her to do so in order to miss as little actual work time as possible. With the implant ready to go in first thing, she decided to make herself easily accessible with a black mini skirt with pleats that flared around her hips and a red half sweater with three buttons in front. The short skirt showed off her upper thighs when it hung straight and the slightest movements easily caused it to flare and show her bare buttocks. She buttoned only one button of the half sweater, letting her firm breasts strain against it and her nipples dent the soft fabric. She wore five-inch black pumps. Her red thong seemed pointless right now, so she put her hair in a ponytail, using the thong as a ribbon. 

 She was excited about a lot of things today. The way the meeting had gone with the guys yesterday was awesome. Everyone understood and supported her and they had renewed her energy for this job. Cori had been amazing to meet last night. And the whole thought of implanting devices in her pussy and clit today had her moist with anticipation. The knowledge that a new cock -- Jay's -- awaited her and that a voyeur, the mysterious Dr. Pound, would be watching, made it that much more exciting. She was starting to see what Cori meant about teasing and pleasing and being in control. She hadn't thought about it that way. Up until now, she had relinquished control to the guys. While they were still technically in charge, she could see now how she might be able to manipulate them. 

 She tried no to appear too anxious when she strode into the office, but if her sparkling eyes didn't give her away, her dripping pussy would have. 

 "Looks like you're ready to go today," Nelson smiled. Travers and Nelson were already there and had Dr. Pound on videoconference through the computer. Jay and Roy arrived minutes later. 

 Valarie told them all about Cori, noting that Dr. Pound seemed particularly interested, even asking for Cori's phone number. Valarie also noted that the guys had prepared for the morning's events by covering the conference table with three large quilts and she appreciated their thoughtfulness. She laid down on the table and lifted her legs in the air, her pussy in full view of Dr. Pound, who seemed to be providing unnecessary direction on how they should stick their finger in her pussy. Roy helped hold Valarie's legs over her head and Nelson inserted the first device into her pussy. 

 "A little deeper," Dr. Pound's voice boomed. "No, not too deep. Just about the first knuckle. Good, now hook your finger up and stick that thing to her pussy wall. You don't have to push too hard. Don't want to hurt our little sweety." 

 When Nelson pulled his finger out of Valarie's pussy, he licked it off. "She's that sweet, huh?" Pound teased. "Wish you could send me a little sample. OK, now rub her a little bit and make sure she's good and wet and that little clit is saying hello for you." 

 They let Jay rub her pussy and after a few minutes he gave the wet thumbs up sign that she was ready to go, then licked her juices from all five fingers. Travers stepped forward with the pin for her clit and Nelson held her lips back so he'd have a clear shot. As gently as he could he inserted the tiny needle into her clit. Valarie felt the little prick, but it didn't really hurt. Just like a little sting from a baby bee.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut In Training Ch. 04 ****** bydlsloan© "OK, before you put her legs down, let's test the remote," Pound said. "Hit 'Talk'. What do you feel, Valarie?" 

 "Oh my," she gasped. "It's, it's like little lightning bolts inside my pussy. Oh, ahhh." 

 "Good," Pound said. "Now try the left dial." 

 "What's that do?" Travers said. 

 "You'll see." Travers turned the knob on the left about half a turn. 

 "Oh, what is that, oohh!" Valarie squirmed. 

 "That, my dear, is that little thing spinning around in your pussy. Do you like it, slut?" Pound asked. 

 "Yes, yes," she said. 

 "Try the right dial." Travers turned it and instantly Valarie's hips bucked off the table. 

 "Spins in her clit, too," Pound chuckled. "The red button at the bottom turns up the heat on both devices. Hit it once for every degree you want to warm her up." 

 "Oh, I feel that," Valarie said. "Very warm. Shit, that feels so good." 

 "Now, gentlemen, you can see the fun you can have with this," Pound said. "You can torment her for hours, turning it off and on, up and down, or you can get her off in about a minute. Turn on the heat, rotation and jolts all at once and she'll cream all over that quilt." 

 "I'm about to cream all over it too," Roy said. He was still holding Valarie's ankles over her head, but she had noted the bulge in his pants and was rubbing it with both hands. 

 "Looks like your girl is ready for some cock," Pound said. "Any of you man enough to satisfy this little bitch, or will she have to rely on my invention to do the work of four men?" 

 "Fuck your invention," Roy spat as Valarie worked the zipper down on his slacks and his cock slipped out onto her forehead. Valarie heard other zippers and the clink of belt buckles as pants hit the floor and the room filled with throbbing penises. 

 "What's your pleasure, Jay?" Travers asked. 

 "What are my choices?" 

 "Mouth or pussy," Travers said. "We haven't tapped that ass, as the kids say, just yet. But I assure you, you'll be very pleased either way." 

 "Mouth," Jay said. 

 "Given our time constraints, I suggest we pair up," Travers said. He directed traffic. Valarie got off the table and Jay laid down on it, his knees hanging over the edge, his cock sticking straight up in the air. Valarie positioned herself between his legs, then bent over at the waist and spread her legs slightly. Jay unbuttoned her sweater and Roy yanked down her skirt. Her breasts hung down, pushing her sweater aside and she stepped nimbly out of the skirt, her legs looking long and inviting, their shape accentuated by her heels. She wiggled her ass at Roy and looked over her shoulder at him, desperately wanting him inside her. The heated buzzing inside her most private parts was demanding attention, like an itch she couldn't scratch. Ah, but a thick hard cock could provide some relief. 

 She looked at Jay and saw the lust in his eyes. A drop of pre-cum already dotted the head of his cock, which was thick and veiny and looked like a nice mouthful. Somehow, amidst all the commotion, including seemingly endless commentary by Pound, she remembered her training and gave Jay cute, puppy-eyed looked with pouty lips, "May I have the honor of sucking your cock, sir?" she said in a sweet, innocent voice. "Hell yes," Jay said. 

 Valarie smiled and put her hands behind her back and lowered her mouth over the head of his cock, tasting that salty pre-cum and cleaning it off for him. She worked the top half of his cock with her tongue and lips and a good amount of suction, tasting and teasing him. She felt Roy move in behind her and his cock bumped against her ass cheek. Then he guided it inside her steamy pussy which celebrated his arrival and clamped tightly around his shaft. 

 "Lick my balls," Jay said. He held his cock against his belly and she lapped and sucked at his balls, licking the sensitive area just beneath them, then running her tongue roughly over the taut skin encasing his balls. He offered his cock back to her by bumping it on her nose and she went back to work. This time, his hands went to the back of her head and she heard Pound chuckle, "That's it. Let's see if this bitch can deep throat." He sounded like such a creep. Why were Travers and the guys involved with him? That thought lasted only a split second, interrupted by the waves of pleasure now coursing through her vaginal walls as her orgasm finally hit. 

 "She's cumming!" Pound yelled seconds before she actually did. Somewhere in the back of her lust-filled brain she realized he was watching the data from her pussy. Could he actually tell she was cumming? She didn't care. She came hard, then felt the devices spinning inside her and realized Nelson was playing with the remote, driving her even further over the edge. She had lost control of her body. It had been taken over by four intruders, two big cocks and two tiny little silver buttons, all of them forcing her body to do things, to perform, to be a vehicle for all things sex. 

 She was also about to become a vehicle for sperm, which would soon be shot into her body through two different orifices. Jay was close, she could tell. His cock was lodged deep in her throat, much to the delight on one Dr. Pound, she imagined, and he was forcing her head up and down as fast as he could. 

 "Here, I can help with that," she heard Roy say. Then she felt Jay's hands let go only to be replaced by Roy's, who was now shoving her head down on Jay's cock, the weight of Roy's body providing that much more downward force. Normally she would have pulled back once he started cumming and sucked the cum out of his cock. But Roy kept her head pinned down and Jay's semen shot directly into the back of threat. She swallowed as fast as she could, but much of it oozed back around his shaft, filling in the little bit of space left in her mouth, forcing her cheeks to puff out. Roy kept her head in place even after Jay was done and she had to force herself to keep sucking into the back of her throat so she could swallow it down. Finally Jay gave Roy the sign that he was done and Valarie came up for air, taking a big gulp, which elicited another evil chuckle from Pound. 

 "Bitches can't breathe cum -- at least not yet," he said to everyone and no one in particular. "Maybe one of these days I'll invent a pill for that too." Valarie noticed that no one seemed to be responding to anything he said. Even in their combined states of lust, they found his comments crude. 

 As Jay climbed off the table and her body reached a plateau from the ecstasy of her orgasm and the strain of swallowing his cock, her mind cleared a bit. Roy was pounding her hard now, his balls slapping against her wet pussy, which was still all tingling and warm and gooey. As she listened to him grunt and ground her body against his, it occurred to her that this was a monumental day. Her first double penetration, her first gang bang. Then it occurred to her that she had used the word "first", which implied there would at least be a second. Would there? Oh goodness, what kind of slut had multiple gang bangs? Yet she knew there would be more. She'd been here less than a week and already she was doing four guys at once. Could she really expect to go a full year without a few repeat performances? The stuff of forbidden fantasies for most women was becoming her daily reality. She smiled as Roy pulled out and yanked her off the table. She opened her mouth just in time, taking her second load of cum in as many minutes. This load coated her tongue which she held out for him like a panting puppy dog. She held it there, trying not to think about the disgusting taste, until he finally nodded and told her to swallow. 

 "Doesn't much care for the taste yet, does she boys?" Pound chuckled. How did he know? She hadn't made a face or gagged or anything to tip him off. "Might need to put her on a cum diet for a week or so. Slut will be begging for a drink from your cock before you know it. Tell her it will make her tits grow." 

 Again, no one responded so Valarie ignored the crude doctor and watched as Travers and Nelson stepped forward, holding their cocks in their hands. Travers sat in one of the conference room chairs and Nelson and Valarie climbed onto the table. In order to get to Travers' cock, Valarie had to lean way over the edge of the table, putting her hands on the arms of Travers' chair to keep herself from falling. Due to the strain on her neck and back, she had to use her arms to basically do pushups so she could raise her head up and down on his cock. In this precarious position, her ass was pointed high in the air, her knees on the table, spread wide for balance. Nelson knelt behind her and sunk his cock into her wet and wide open pussy. His strong hands held her around the waist, providing additional support. 

 She stopped worrying about falling and focused on fucking. Her pussy was several steps of ahead of her. Spurred on by the randomly spinning, jolting, warming buttons inside her, commanded now by Jay and Roy, she was wet and warm and building toward another orgasm that promised to hit soon. 

 "Orgasm warning!" Pound shouted. "Your bitch is gonna blow again soon." 

 If it was possible to take the fun out an orgasm, the annoying doctor was doing it. Valerie tried to shut her ears while her mouth and pussy stayed wide open, providing welcoming homes for her two latest guests. She was having trouble getting low enough to deep throat Travers. "Put your hands behind your back," he said, putting his hands on her chest. She trusted him and put her hands back. Then he removed his hands from her chest and all her weight fell forward until she was supported only her lips, the base of his cock and Nelson's strong hands. She couldn't help but deep throat him now. The only way she could pull off Travers' cock was for one or both of the guys to push her back up on the table. Until then, it was up to Travers and his trusty sword to keep her from falling. 

 Unfortunately, Nelson had all but given up on fucking her right now, which caused her orgasm to subside just before it hit. But the desire to feel Nelson back inside her drove her to work as hard as she could on Travers, using her tongue and suction to make up for the lack of head bobbing. And it was working. Travers was groaning and squirming in the seat, pumping his cock as much as he could. It jerked inside her mouth three times, then on the fourth, the cum started flying, hitting the roof of her mouth and splashing down on her teeth, gums and tongue. It started sliding back down his shaft and she slurped it back into her mouth, determined to take in every drop. 

 Driven by the urgent need to have cock back inside her, she finished sucking Travers dry and hopped off the table at Nelson's direction. He sat in one of the chairs and Valarie climbed on top of him, sticking her slender legs through the holes between the arm rests and the seat so that she could lower herself completely onto him. As soon as she felt his cock part her willing lips, she was sure the temperature in her pussy shot up 10 degrees. The heat and tingling returned instantly, only partly due to her new implants. 

 Nelson sensed that she needed to get off, so he sat back and let her ride him at her pace, which was fast and determined. She was using the strength in her well-toned legs and hips to bounce up and down and grind her pussy down onto his shaft. She felt so hot, she was pretty sure their friction could start a fire. Nelson's cock felt unbelievable inside her, so steely strong and rigid and thick. She was aware that five men were watching her at her absolute sluttiest. Her nipples were hard, her body glistened with sweat, dried cum clung to her chin and her pussy was making seductive, wet sounds on his cock. She was bouncing and moaning and grinding and humping. 

 "Zap her, she's coming," Pound said. She felt the electric jolts in her pussy and clit intensify. Nelson's cock flexed and swelled, close to exploding. She beat him the punch, cumming hard but never slowing her pace. She rode him right through one orgasm and into the next, her third of the morning coinciding with Nelson's cock erupting inside her. They both slumped in the chair, arms and legs entwined. 

 "They tell me that was your first gang bang," Pound said, breaking their moment of rapture. "You came three times, my dear. Safe to say you'll jump at the chance the next time someone mentions a gang bang?" 

 "Um, I don't know," Valarie said softly. 

 "Sure you do, but you can keep pretending if you want," Pound sneered. Valarie thought she heard voices in the background behind him, but wasn't sure. 

 "Listen, doc," Nelson said, trying to control his rising anger, "cut her some slack, all right. She's a classy girl, not one of your whores." 

 "Not yet," Pound taunted. 

 "Not ever," Nelson said flatly. 

 "Oh, I'm not good enough for your little princess, I suppose," Pound said. "She's so pristine, I forgot. Doesn't like fucking. Doesn't dress like a slut. Oh wait, she came in wearing her underwear in her hair and came three times while fucking four guys. You'll forgive me for not confusing her with the Queen of England. As far as not wanting me, well, you might be right. After all, she gets four cocks all to herself. Me, well, I share my cock with six women at one time." 

 The camera shifted and they looked at the monitor as six beautiful young women appeared on screen. They all were topless and wore only g-strings, thigh-high stockings and stilettos. 

 "With all due respect to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, I call this my Rainbow Coalition," Pound said. Indeed, the girls represented a wide range of colors. He had a brunette, a blonde, a redhead, an Asian, an African-American and a Latino. "I'd introduce you, but I don't know their names. I just say bitch or slut or cunt or whore and they all answer. Go figure. Anyway, Sweet Valarie, tonight when you're laying in bed by yourself, playing with your clit, just think about what you're about to see. Think about more cock than you've ever seen, more cum than you've ever tasted, a better fuck than you've ever had. Watch and you'll see why they line up every day for me." 

 He shut up finally and they watched as he pulled out his cock and waved it front of the camera. It was hard to judge the size until he called one of the girls -- the redhead -- over and had her kneel down. He draped his cock over her head like a hair band. It was huge. Valarie gasped in spite of herself. Slowly she climbed off Nelson and they all gathered around the screen, not wanting to watch but unable to look away as the girls positioned themselves, kneeling in front of him. 

 The girls arranged themselves carefully until one was below him, between his legs, sucking on his balls. Another, the black girl, was sucking the head of his penis. The other four somehow managed to each find room to put their mouths on the sides of his cock. Six mouths, one cock. It was a massive organ. 

 The girls all looked to be very experienced. Big fake tits on four of them, collagen-injected lips on three, telltale tongue and nipple piercings. Valarie guessed most of them were escorts or strippers, but somehow she got the feeling they weren't being paid for this. The joy and excitement in their face seemed real, their hard nipples and occasional touches of their own pussies suggested at genuine arousal. And they devoured his cock like it was their first meal in months. 

 For his part, Pound seemed quite calm and relaxed, like this was something that happened all the time. Valarie wondered if it really did or if he was all talk and cock. After several minutes of the suck fest, the girls all stopped as if on cue and knelt down on the floor in a line, shoulder to shoulder, hands behind their backs, tits out, mouths open, tongues out. Pound reappeared on the screen, his monstrous cock sticking straight out. He stood next to the first girl, the blonde, and stroked his cock. The girls all tilted their heads back, noses pointed straight up in the air. 

 Pound looked at the camera, grinned and then fired an unbelievably long strand of rope-like cum across the line of beauties, watching as it landed square on the nose of the brunette -- the girl farthest from him -- and fell in a continuous line across the noses of the other five girls. He shifted his feet slightly to the left and then, as if he had just reloaded a shotgun, pumped his cock again and sent another rope across their faces, this one dropping across each tongue. 

 As unbelievable as the volume and aim of his spurts was the fact that Pound stopped after the second one, held his cock up against his belly, smiled at the camera again, then pumped his cock and fired a third stream that landed across each forehead. Somehow, he not only seemed able to stop and start his orgasm at will, but also showed no signs of decreasing the volume of his spurts nor the size of his erection. 

 "Impressed yet, Sweet Slut?" he asked. He turned back and hit each breast with the fourth rope. The fifth and final shot resulted in five milk mustaches. The he shoved his cock into the blonde's mouth and she extracted whatever was left. 

 "How many times do you think you'd come riding on this?" Pound taunted, waving his still hard cock at them. "Thanks for letting me be part of the show today. Valarie, remember, I'll be watching you." 

 The monitor went blank and everyone slowly started getting dressed, exhausted by the morning's events and dazed by what they had just seen.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut in Training Ch. 05 ****** bydlsloan© Chapter Five: Waves of Pleasure 

 The rest of the week was a blur for Valarie. Dr. Pound had taken it upon himself to send three more remotes to the implants in her pussy and clit. So, now Nelson, Travers and Roy each had one and she had one for herself. Just keeping up with her sex log, answering the phones and doing the filing was a chore because the guys were constantly playing with their new toys, taking great joy in watching her react to the buzzing and spinning and jolting going on inside her. 

 Each day she had discarded her underwear by lunch time. Her pussy was almost constantly aroused and she would thoroughly soak her underwear and leave wet stains on her leather office chair. Sometimes they would let her touch herself, sometimes she could use a dildo, but most of the time the instructions - - always received via instant message on her computer screen -- would tell her to keep her hands off. So she put her hands flat on her desk, resisting the urge to touch her breasts, her torso, her pussy. She would focus on the little devices inside her, picturing them churning slowly, tiny bolts of electricity firing back and forth while they warmed up, gradually glowing red. She knew there were no actual bolts of electricity and the devices weren't red hot, but that's what she pictured. She imagined her nerves reaching out touching these oh-so-welcome intruders, drawing power and energy from them and then sending that pulse throughout her body, all of it starting in her pussy and spreading down her legs, to her ass into her belly to her nipples, her lips, her tongue. She felt tingly and warm and squirmed in anticipation. 

 She was learning more about her body every time. She could feel her orgasms build, sometimes recede, then build again before finally hitting her in waves. She cried out sometimes, but mostly she focused on maintaining a professional appearance and put her head down, suppressing moans, breathing deeply, body trembling and sweating. Then she would slump forward, wait for the devices to stop and then slowly stand up on wobbly, coltish legs and go to the restroom to clean up and compose herself. 

 No one said a word. The guys kept working hard, giving no outward signal that they were aware. But she knew they were watching. She knew they were checking out her data on the web site. She knew their cocks were rising and falling in their pants all day. And she knew it was only a matter of time before she felt the warm buzz and the sweet shudder of relief that came with another orgasm. 

 Not only did they not say anything about it during the day, but the guys didn't even talk about it during their dates in the evening. Of course, by then they were usually busy acting out various sexual fantasies and working out the sexual tension built up during the days in between their dates. The obsessive Dr. Pound, on the other hand, emailed Valarie after almost every orgasm, congratulating her work and asking for feedback on the devices. As arrogant and creepy as he was, he seemed genuinely interested in knowing more about what she was feeling, what she liked and didn't like and what she thought about other ideas he had. Travers and the others encouraged her to report back to Pound, but warned her not to let the doctor get inside her head. Funny, she thought, her mind seemed to be the only place on her body the doctor wasn't interested in getting inside. But she understood what they meant. She could see where he could be a dangerous man -- he was disgusting and yet powerful and enticing and sexy at the same time. She was glad he was far away. His emails and sexist comments were harmless enough. 

 While Pound represented a somewhat unsettling newcomer in her life, Jay, the computer guy, and Cori Banks, the sexy fitness instructor, had both proved to be welcome additions. After that first gang bang in the conference room, Jay had come back in a few more times to make some tweaks to the new computer program and to integrate the software model Cori had sent allowing them all to see and track Valarie's workouts and progress. Never had Jay assumed that she was going to have sex with him and she liked that. He didn't act entitled to anything and on Thursday when Travers had mentioned that Jay had been doing some terrific work and nodded subtly at Valarie, she knew what to do. She went to lunch with him and fucked him in the back of his SUV, letting him have a go at her pussy since he'd only had a blowjob the first time around. 

 With everything else being so scheduled, she liked that Jay was this variable who every now and then would be given the opportunity to fuck her. She also really liked her evening visits with Cori, who was fast becoming a trusted friend as well as a fantastic fitness instructor. Cori did most of the exercises with Valarie, demonstrating the flexibility and strength and body tone that Valarie aspired to. She was quietly proud of herself for being able to keep up and perform remarkably close to Cori's impressive level. Cori was constantly praising her and pushing her to go just a little further. 

 Particularly fun were the lively dance aerobics and pole dancing they did, the stretching was extreme but beneficial and the yoga was just bizarre. In a quiet, dark room they would meditate and move quietly from one position to another, the only sound being Cori's soft whisper as they changed positions. This wasn't like any yoga class Valarie had ever taken, but she did find it relaxing, even though there was usually a ball gag or dildo in her mouth during the exercise. Cori had told her that cock-sucking and deep throating was all about mind over matter and being comfortable. "You can deep throat just about any guy, it's not about stretching your throat or suppressing your gag reflex. If you think about it, you'll gag sooner or later. It's about being comfortable with large objects in your mouth. Not trying to chew or swallow or do anything but suck and lick. You should be able to suck cock for hours on end if you want to. The key is to put your mind in the right place, focus and relax. The cock's not going to hurt you." So, they would sit and relax with dildos and ball gags and panties and other items stuffed in their mouths, breathing slowly through their noses. 

 Other than those weird sessions, Cori and Valarie were seldom quiet. They talked like they had know each other for years. Valarie felt like Cori was her best friend and big sister all rolled into one hot, hard body. More than once their talking carried over and they lost track of time, only to be interrupted by buzzing cell phones from men with impatient cocks in need of attention. They'd laugh, shower and dress in equally slutty attire, scurrying off to put their bodies to use in the manner for which they had been training so hard. 

 Valarie told Cori everything, including all about her first gang bang and the new devices she had implanted inside her pussy. She told her about all the guys and who she liked and how they fucked and what made her cum. Cori was equally forthcoming about her past, to the point that Valarie felt like she knew many of Cori's friends herself. She knew that a sweet but powerful black man named Ty was both Cori's protector and the stretcher of her ass. Valarie found these stories particularly interesting since she'd never been fucked in the ass. She knew that day would come soon and took interest in Cori's details and frank admission that it wasn't that pleasurable for her and never felt natural, even though she'd done it many times -- much like swallowing cum still felt foreign to Valarie. 

 Cori prepared Valarie for what was to cum by having her do some exercises with dildos in her pussy or butt plugs in her ass. It was all about getting used to it, training your body to accept it and prepare for it. Their bodies were strong and firm and flexible and would conform to whatever task they needed to perform. That's what Cori kept telling her and, watching Cori move and hearing her unbelievable stories, she believed her. 

 Valarie noticed, however, that Cori said little about her current situation. It was obvious she had money coming from somewhere besides being a personal trainer and the way she jumped when her phone rang told Valarie that some guy or group of guys still had some control over her new friend. It didn't seem to be a bad thing, though. She seemed very happy and confident and totally at ease. Valarie hoped she could get that way. Travers, Nelson and Roy had been very caring, generous and patient with her to this point, so she was anxious to return the favor. 

 She was also looking forward to their big yacht trip. They were leaving Saturday for a whole week. She thought it would be just thing to relax her and help her connect with the guys and hopefully develop that deeply caring relationship that Cori enjoyed with so many of her past partners. 

 They gave her the day off the day before the trip so she could rest up and pack what little she needed. Were it not for her shoes, Valarie could have packed everything she needed for the cruise in her purse. The guys had each selected a handful of items they wanted her to wear and she chose a couple as well. Anticipating hot sunny days on the open ocean, her attire apparently would consist of nothing thicker than a piece of string all week. Oh, they had thrown in a couple other specialty items for unexpected cold weather and occasional stops at ports along the way. Her bottles of lotion and oil were taking up as much room as anything else. 

 Since Valarie would not help pay for any portion of the trip, her contribution was that she would be available to each of them every day. They would still take turns spending the night with her and one guy each day would be in charge of her wardrobe. 

 Cori had told her about a similar trip she had in which she was tied to the side of the boat and fucked by a group of guys while hundreds of people on a cruise shop watched. Valarie couldn't imagine something like that and was glad that her men were a little more discreet -- they had images and reputations to uphold, after all. Of course, who would they bump into on the ocean that they would know? If there was anywhere they could take some risks, that would be the place. The thought worried, then excited her. She felt her pussy tingling and she wondered if any of them were watching her online right now and saw the changes in the data from her pussy. 

 Jay, who would not be making the cruise, had already arranged for their laptops and cell phones to serve as receivers for the data being produced inside Valarie's pussy, so the readings would continue throughout the week. 

 Valarie slept fitfully the night before the trip. It had been nice of the guys to let her have the night off, but she found it gave her too much time to think. She remembered seeing commercials about party planners on cruise ships and realized that she was, in effect, the party planner for this trip. The pressure would be on her to entertain and please all three men all the time. And she knew that there were likely to be double penetrations, perhaps even her first anal fuck, and almost constant nudity. Could she really be sexy all day long, day after day? As it was, she had down time during her workouts with Cori, her days off and even at work she could sometimes get lost in what she was doing. But in the open ocean with nothing but blue water and her to stare at, she could foresee the guys stepping things up, being more demanding of her both in terms of frequency and performance. She was going to need a vacation after this vacation. 

 The next morning she woke early and put on the requested Day One bikini. It was a skimpy dark blue suit that linked in the front via a half-dollar sized gold ring between her breasts. The triangles over her breasts sliced evenly over each side of her nipple, with a horizontal base that left the bottom of her perky breasts exposed. It tied simply around the neck and behind the back. The bottom tied on the sides and formed a "T" in the back, leaving her ass cheeks exposed as it dipped between her firm buns, gently hugging her pussy lips before gradually expanding into a small, short "V" that barely covered her small landing strip. It was skimpy, yes, but there was nothing particularly scandalous about it and Valarie met Roy at the door as planned, striding confidently in her white sandals with three-inch platform heels. 

 "You look fantastic as always," Roy said as they got in the car. 

 "Thanks," Valarie said. "I must say, I thought my outfit might be a bit wilder than this. This isn't that different from what the old me would have worn to the beach." 

 "That's good," Roy said, grinning. "I guess you haven't gotten it wet yet, huh?" Without waiting for an answer, he picked up a spray bottle filled with water. He aimed it at her breasts and pulled the trigger half a dozen times. Then, he pulled her thighs apart and sprayed between her legs. As the suit soaked up the water, the dark blue became lighter, the material seemed to get thinner and tighter. The triangles on her breasts were now half their original size. Same with her pussy, which was now bared to reveal over an inch of landing strip. 

 Valarie watched in amazement as her nipples came into view through the material, which was acting much like a wet t-shirt. Her nipples hardened, partly because of the excitement of the trip and moreso from the cold water. Roy grinned and pinched her left nipple between his thumb and forefinger. Valarie thought he was just trying to make them harder -- and it was working - - but when he let go, she realized that he had been molding the material to wrap around her nipple, tight as a glove. She couldn't believe how moldable and clingy it had become. He repeated the process on her right nipple, then reached between her legs and ran his fingers along the outside of her pussy lips, then right down the middle, molding the fabric around both sides. Valarie had seen pictures of models with bathing suits that were painted on. This reminded her of how they looked, her outfit was now so tightly wrapped to her body that it looked like it was painted on -- with just one coat of very thin paint. 

 "Wear something like that a lot back in Scotland, did ya?" Roy smiled. 

 "No," Valarie said, laughing at how ridiculous she felt. "Let me guess, this suit isn't going to get dry today, is it?" 

 "Well, we'll be on an ocean filled with water," Roy said. "I think it's safe to say we'll find a way to keep your suit, um, lubricated." 

 Valarie grinned, excited at the prospect of being on display for all three men all day long, totally at the mercy of their every whim and desire. That also made her nervous. What would they expect of her? Could she deliver? Relax, she told herself. Remember, they like you. Have confidence. Trust yourself. Cori has prepared you for this. 

 She felt tingly all over and no one was even buzzing her pussy. Nelson and Travers were already waiting for them at the dock. Roy parked at the opposite end of the marina, forcing them to walk all the way along the pier, Valarie's barely-there suit and long legs creating quite a stir even among those who had seen more than their fair share of bikini-clad hotties. A girl that hot only dressed that way for a boat ride for one reason, and everyone knew it. Roy helped Valarie climb aboard the yacht, following her with both their bags. 

 Valarie was not surprised that Travers and Nelson both had squirt bottles nor that they quickly re-doused her suit before stepping back to take a good look. "Seriously, boys, why didn't we ever think about this sooner?" Nelson said. "Damn, this is going to be a fun trip. Valarie, you look simply stunning, my dear." 

 "Thank you," she blushed. "This boat is amazing. I've never been on anything like this." They showed her around the sprawling deck with soft white cushioned seats, a matching u-shaped couch, a mini bar and several deck chairs; the cabin below with a central sitting area decorated like a den, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The fact that there were only three beds didn't concern her in the least -- she knew she wouldn't be sleeping alone anytime on this trip. 

 Valarie noticed that the boat was already stocked with supplies -- food, water, etc. and that Travers and Nelson had already put away their clothes in their rooms. Roy stowed his away, but there wasn't a spot for Valarie's stuff. 

 "Oh, I created a little area all your own up top," Travers said, grabbing her bag. He led the way back to the deck and motioned to a small metal bin next to the u-shaped couch. "You can put your things in there. That will make it easier for you to change into different outfits quickly. And since we'll be in the middle of the ocean, well, privacy isn't really an issue, now is it?" 

 "Um, of course not," Valarie said, carefully unpacking her clothes and trying to arrange them in neat piles in the bin, placing her various shoes and toiletries along the interior edge. She smiled to herself as she did this, oddly proud that she had bent over at the waist without even thinking about it. Some of this stuff was finally becoming second nature to her. 

 She helped them cast off the lines and Travers guided the luxurious yacht gently out of the harbor. Valarie stood at the bow, looking out over the open water, the wind beginning blow gently through her hair. Nelson and Roy stood on either side of her and Nelson handed her a glass of champagne. 

 "It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?" she asked, accepting the glass. 

 "It's our tradition to toast our voyage," Nelson explained. They hoisted their glasses toward Travers, who looked down at them, holding his own glass. 

 "Here's to fair weather, safe travels, good friends and bikinis," Travers said. 

 

 "You seem a little anxious," Nelson said, putting his hand on Valarie's bare back. 

 "I'm just a little nervous," Valarie said. 

 "Nothing to be nervous about," Nelson said, rubbing her back. "You know, when I get wound up, the best thing for me to do is just lay back, close my eyes and relax and take a few deep breaths." 

 He guided Valarie to one of the deck chairs and Roy laid the seat back so she was laying with her upper torso at about a 45 degree angle. "Just close your eyes and relax," Nelson said again. 

 They left her there and joined Travers on the bridge. Valarie thought it was wonderful that they were giving her time to adjust and relax and enjoy the warm mid-morning sun, which shone down brightly. Her dark sunglasses cut the glare, but she closed her eyes anyway, taking deep breaths as Nelson had suggested, her hands resting at her sides. She wasn't sure how long she lay like that and wasn't aware that she had fallen asleep until she felt the buzzing. It started low and slow, but there was no mistaking it. Her pussy was being buzzed. 

 She didn't bother to look around or even open her eyes. She was relaxed and comfortable and the tingling in her pussy was a welcome guest at her little private party of one. She pictured the three men still on the bridge, holding their remotes in one hand and cocks in the other, watching her, fiddling with the controls, waiting for her to squirm, to spread her legs, to touch herself, to moan. 

 She wanted to tease them and pretended to still be asleep, remaining motionless while her pussy buzzed and hummed. She nearly drifted back to sleep, but woke back up when she felt her own hand touching the inner part of her thigh. She heard a couple of chuckles from above and realized that her charade was over. She opened up her thighs and cupped her hand over her pussy, feeling the moist heat against her palm. She moved her bikini bottom to the side, surprised at how she had to peel it away from her skin like Saran wrap off a baking dish. And the main dish underneath was definitely hot and ready to eat.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut in Training Ch. 05 ****** bydlsloan© She sunk her index finger easily into her juicy slit, feeling the vibrations from within her pussy tingling through her fingers. With her right hand occupied, her left hand drifted to her breasts, pinching her nipples, pulling the suit away to introduce her hard buds to the warm sun and cool breeze. 

 Now she felt hands on her legs and realized that at least two of the men had come down and were now spreading her legs wide, holding them out. "Here, I'll get some chairs," she heard Travers say and realized they were all three there. She wondered who was guiding the boat, but assumed they were probably just drifting now in open water. 

 "Take my remote," she heard Roy say and she heard the clatter of the remotes being set down somewhere off to her right, set aside while the men worked to put her in whatever position they had in mind. All the while, Valarie kept her eyes closed, gently stroking her pussy and breasts. 

 She felt light-weight chains being clipped to her ankles and to something on the deck -- chairs or a table, she assumed -- holding her legs apart, but with enough slack that she could rest her feet on the deck or raise her legs about a foot off the ground. Another chain went around her belly and the chair, pinning her in place with no slack at all. She had no complaints until a thin strap was placed between her lips and also tied behind the chair, pinning her head to the chair and making it impossible for her to talk. Her sunglasses were replaced with a blindfold. They bent her arms back so they met behind the chair, linking her wrists loosely with another light chain, enough play in it to allow her to move her arms and take the strain off her shoulders. 

 They pulled at her suit and she was surprised to feel it tear away in pieces. They took off her shoes and left her completely naked, exposed to the sun, the wind and their eyes. The buzzing in her pussy never stopped and she ached to touch it, to pull on her nipples to make herself cum. But she knew that was part of what this was about. Getting her aroused. Making her want it, need it, breaking through her doubts and nervousness and unleashing that unbridled lust that they were determined to see. 

 Hands stroked her thighs and stomach and hair, but never her breasts, never her pussy. The men were silent, letting her imagination be the only voice she heard as she submitted to her predicament, giving into the light bonds, the lewd display and the relentless vibrations. She gave into her body, its basic, natural wants and desires, straining to move, to grind her hips. Failing, she moved the only part of her body that would help -- her legs, pumping them up and down, trying to generate any friction she could. But, spread so far apart, the effort was futile. The buzzing continued. The aching, the desire, the need continued. She wanted to cry out, but couldn't. She wanted to touch herself, but couldn't. She wanted to jump on the nearest cock or dildo or fucking telephone pole, but couldn't. 

 Frustration turned to desperation and finally, culmination, her pussy clutching and squeezing so hard as orgasm finally overtook her. She came, her pussy and legs and stomach contracting, sweat glistening on her skin, moisture oozing from between her legs. 

 "All right, Roy, turn it off," Travers said, obviously referring to the vibrator. 

 "Sure, um, wait, where are the remotes?" 

 "Right ... well, they were right there on that table." 

 "Well, here's one of the batteries and a battery cover," Roy said, his voice further away, close to the bow, Valarie guessed. 

 She pictured the table next to the U-shaped couch on the side of the boat, near the bow. That must have been where they put the remotes. So if they fell off... 

 "You don't think they fell off the boat, do you?" Travers asked. 

 "Um, yeah, I think they might have," Nelson said. "I mean, they could have slid right off the table and over the edge." 

 "I sure don't see them anywhere else," Roy said. 

 "Well now what do we do?" Nelson asked. "How can we turn it off?" 

 "I don't think we can," Travers said. 

 Valarie trembled at the thought, then came again. 

 "Damn, will you look at that," Nelson said. "Boys, we'll figure out this problem with the remote in a minute. Right now, I gotta take care of this." 

 Valarie couldn't see Nelson pull his cock out, but assumed it was his that bumped against her cheek while the strap in her mouth was removed. The chain around her belly was also taken off and she was raised up, sitting straight up now, legs still splayed to the sides, blindfold still on. She assumed it was Nelson's cock that plowed into her mouth and filled her throat and his hands that held her head between them, guiding her back and forth on his steel-hard dick. She assumed it was his balls bumping against her chin and his cum that ultimately splattered on her cheeks, chin and neck. 

 She wasn't sure which cock was next, only that it was just as hard, the grip just as firm, the fucking just as urgent. And the wad seemed even larger as it poured out across her breasts and belly. Whoever was third was the most desperate of all, no doubt holding his load impatiently. He lasted less than a minute in her mouth before smearing white goo all across her upper thighs and lower belly. 

 They were just removing her leg chains and blindfold when Roy yelled, "Hey, hurry up, someone's coming!" 

 Valarie tried to look and see, but the sun burned her eyes. Nelson handed her sunglasses back to her. First, she looked down at herself, seeing the telltale globs of white splattered all over her nude body. Then, as her eyes adjusted, she looked out over the water, seeing nothing at first, then a small speck on the horizon. It was definitely growing larger as it approached. 

 "Put something on," Travers told her. She looked down and saw the tattered remains of her first bikini. There was no worry, there were plenty more in the box. She opened it hurriedly, trying to find one that wasn't too skimpy, but realized the effort was pointless. They were all skimpy and the boat was coming fast. She grabbed a hot pink one and bolted down the stairs, quickly pulling on the pink suit. The bottom was simply a rectangular piece, about two inches wide, that stretched to the midpoint between her navel and her landing strip, covering her pussy before narrowing to a spaghetti strap that separated her ass cheeks. At the top of her ass cheeks the strap connected to thin silver chain that hugged her body, snaking over her hips and connecting to the top corners of the pink rectangle in front. The top was also geometrically designed, with little two-inch pink squares covering both nipples and little else. Like the bottoms, the squares were attached in front by a thin silver chain and the top tied behind her neck and back with tiny pink spaghetti straps. 

 She came back up on the deck and saw the boat was less than 100 yards away. It was a small Coast Guard skiff with a two-man crew aboard. As they got closer, they threw a rope and Roy caught it and tied them on and helped the men aboard. 

 "Afternoon, gentlemen," Travers said. "Is everything all right?" 

 Valarie was worried that somehow someone had seen them. That she was going to be arrested for indecent exposure or lewd behavior or something. Of course, some would consider what she was wearing now indecent exposure. She glanced down at herself, horrified to realize that, in her haste, she hadn't cleaned off the cum. Some of it had already dried or dripped off, of course, but there were still obvious white globs on her thighs, belly and between her breasts. She looked at the mirrored sunglasses of one of the Coast Guardsmen and realized there was a dab of white still on her chin. She assumed touching any of it would only draw attention, so she didn't touch it. Of course, she was already drawing plenty of attention, nearly nude, the only female in a group of five men. She couldn't see the eyes of either of the newcomers -- Wilson and Gentry, according to their name badges -- but was pretty certain they had noticed her. She wondered if they noticed the cum on her body. Fortunately, the sound of the waves hitting the boats more than covered up the faint but persistent humming inside her pussy. 

 "We just wanted to make sure you'd heard about the storm warnings," Wilson said. He was the taller of the two with blond hair and tan skin that would have made him look like a surfer dude if not for his uniform and tightly muscled body. Gentry was shorter with dark hair that was graying a bit at the temples and was likewise fit and tan. 

 "No," Travers said. "We just left a little over an hour ago. I'm normally very cautious, but I guess I forgot to turn on the radio or check the forecast this time." 

 "You definitely need to be careful and turn that on," Gentry said. "Looks like we've got some storms headed this way. Doesn't look too bad, but you'd be wise to get to shore in the next hour or so and find a good place to dock for awhile." 

 "That's an excellent idea," Travers said. "We'll do that. We've got all week to sail. One day won't ruin anything." 

 "Where you headed?" Gentry asked. 

 "No place in particular," Travers said. "Just having a company retreat. We do it every year. Sail the coast and get away from the office for a bit." 

 "I see," Gentry said. "And you all work together?" 

 "Yes," Travers said. "We work at a law firm." 

 "You OK, miss?" Gentry asked. 

 "I'm fine, thank you," Valarie said, startled that he had addressed her. She was aware that her voice shook a bit and tried to make it stop. 

 "You mind if I talk to the lady in private for a moment," Gentry said. It wasn't a question and he didn't wait for a response. He took Valarie by the elbow and led her away from the group, leaving Wilson to talk to the others about sailing and the weather and whatever else. 

 "I just want to make sure you're all right," Gentry said softly. "Have they hurt you? Are you being held against your will?" 

 "Oh no," Valarie said a little too hastily. "I'm fine. I work with them and we're on our retreat. I just started working there a few weeks ago and this is my first sailing trip, so I'm a little nervous." 

 "Where are you from?" 

 "Scotland," Valarie said. "Just came to the states less than a month ago." 

 "I see," Gentry said. She was sure he was looking right at her chin. "What's the white stuff on your skin?" 

 "Oh, that must be sunscreen," Valarie said. "Did I not rub it all in?" 

 "There's some on your chin and a few spots on your leg," Gentry said. "Doesn't look like sunscreen, though. You sure these boys haven't done anything to you? You can tell me. I can help you." 

 Valarie thought quickly. She had been too nervous, too careless. She was trying to hide something, but not what Gentry thought. She didn't want to get her guys in trouble, so she decided to tell the truth. 

 "Well, yes they have done something to me," Valarie said. "They all jacked off on me. It's their cum on me." 

 "I see," Gentry said, anger welling in his eyes. 

 "I came twice too," Valarie said. 

 "Excuse me?" 

 "I loved every second of it. It's kind of embarrassing to admit, but I'm kind of a slut," Valarie said. "I do work with them, but I also fuck them." 

 "All three?" 

 "And whoever else they want me to," Valarie said. 

 "Good grief," Gentry said. "And this is all your choice?" 

 "Absolutely," Valarie nodded. Then, playing her trump card, she called out to the others, "Hey guys, you missed a lot of spots. I'm gonna need more sunscreen on my back. Mind if these guys give me some?" 

 Gentry swallowed hard. The little hottie was every bit the slut she claimed to be. He looked around. They were all alone. She was hot, practically daring him to do it. He motioned Wilson over. 

 "You see what she calls sunscreen?" he asked, pointing to a glob of cum between her breasts. "Well, she doesn't have any on her back at all. I've got a load of it to offer. How about you?" 

 "You serious?" Wilson asked, eyeing her hard body. 

 "Do I look like the kind of girl who teases or the kind who pleases?" Valarie said in her most sultry voice. 

 "Gentlemen, we'll leave you and Valarie to attend to her skin care while we check the radar," Travers announced, ushering Nelson and Roy below with him. "I only require that you be respectful and gentle." 

 "Of course," Gentry said, respectfully and gently putting his hand on Valarie's ass and guiding her to the padded, U-shaped bench. He pulled her onto his lap and let his hands roam over her firm body, slipping underneath the patches of fabric, touching her most delicate spots. She felt his cock harden and he shifted so it rubbed against the backs of her thighs. 

 "I didn't know the Coast Guard carried night sticks," Valarie teased. 

 "Night and day," Gentry said. "Wanna see?" 

 "Nope," Valarie pouted. "Wanna taste." 

 "You are a slut and a half," Gentry growled, pushing her off his lap and hastily pulling down his shorts. "Suck on this big thing," he said, wagging it at her. 

 Valarie scrambled onto her hands and knees on the bench and bent her head to his crotch, taking him in her mouth. Wilson sat down behind her, enjoying the view of her ass and pussy in his face. He plucked at the spaghetti strap separating her ass cheeks, then ran his fingers along her pussy. 

 "Holy shit, she's got a vibrator inside her right now!" he said. 

 "What?" Gentry said, his hand on the back of Valarie's head, guiding her oral efforts. 

 "She sure does," Wilson said. "I can feel it. I can hear it! Oh, I see it. It's, oh fuck, it's clamped to her clit. Damn!" 

 Wilson touched his cock to her engorged clit and watched her dance. He touched it again. It was like hitting a button that would send waves of pleasure through her. 

 "What the fuck are you doing to her?" Gentry said. "She's jerking around like a fish out of water." 

 "She's cumming," Wilson said. "This little vibrator thing makes her go crazy every time you touch her clit. No wonder she's such a hot little slut. Can't get enough with this thing on her." 

 "Let me see that," Gentry said, reluctant to take his cock out of the warm confines of her mouth, but too intrigued to miss the rest of this hottie's x- rated show. 

 "Sure, switch me places," Wilson said, happy to take a turn with his cock in Valarie's mouth. Gentry, too, was happy to rub and slap his hard dick against her pussy lips, ass and clit and watch the little bitch squirm and cream and wiggle her ass, asking for more. 

 Gentry slammed his cock hard inside her tight cunt, felt her tighten around him and shiver through yet another orgasm. He wanted to fuck her longer, but couldn't. He pulled out and showered her ass cheeks with a healthy load of sperm. 

 Meanwhile, Wilson was enjoying the show as he alternated stuffing his cock into first her left, then her right cheek, loving the sight of his cock poking her cheeks out. As he neared his own orgasm, he remembered that he was supposed to cum on her back. He pulled his cock out and shoved his balls in her mouth while he jacked his cock, aiming it almost straight up in the air. His cum burst out in stringy blasts that arced in the air and landed in white stripes on her shoulder blades and in the small of her back. 

 When they were done, Valarie sat up and thanked them for the "free sunscreen", giving them both pecks on the cheek. Travers and the others returned to see Gentry and Wilson off. 

 "You say you'll be heading up and down the coast all week?" Gentry asked. 

 "That's right," Travers said. 

 "Well, keep us informed of your position and we can radio ahead and let the others know to keep an eye out for you," Gentry said. "You know, just to keep you all safe." 

 "We appreciate that," Travers said. "We'll head in now to get away from the storm. Thank you, gentlemen." 

 When they had left, Travers turned to Valarie. "Thank you, my dear," he said. "You handled that extremely well. We didn't see that coming, but you improvised and did a great job. Are you OK?" 

 "Yeah, I just, um, I just gotta get this thing outta me or something," she said. "It's driving me crazy." 

 "I know, we can't turn it off," Travers said. "Let's call Dr. Pound and see if he has any ideas." 

 They radioed back to Jay, who left a message for Dr. Pound, then called back, asking for all the details. 

 "I'll let Valarie tell you all about it," Travers said. "Let us know when Pound calls back." 

 Valarie got on the radio and started telling Jay about the day so far. About her suit and how it shrunk and got transparent when it got wet and how the guys tied her up and came all over her. As she went on, she realized he was breathing hard. It hit her that he was jacking off. Somehow, that made it more exciting for her. That persistent buzzing in her pussy took the opportunity to start warming her up again. 

 She told him about scrambling to get dressed and losing the remotes and cumming over and over after she seduced Gentry and Wilson. She heard Jay's breathing increase and felt her own body responding. "I just can't get enough, Jay," she whimpered. "I'm such a little slut right now. Oh fuck. I'm so horny. Can you tell, Jay? Can you tell I'm cumming right now? Oh, my slutty little cunt is cumming again!" 

 "Damn!" he exclaimed. "You just made me cum, too. I've been watching your readings on the computer all morning. You've had eight orgasms already and caused five -- well, six now. Shit, girl, you are amazing. Pound isn't going to believe this. I'll let you know when he calls." 

 About 20 minutes later, Jay radioed back. "You guys aren't going to believe this," he said. "Pound is only about an hour away from you. Said he came up to help his brother open up a new strip club -- guess he's screening the new hires. Anyway, he said to let him know where you dock for the night and he'll come try to fix the Sweet Heat." 

 "All right," Travers said. "But if he's horny, tell him to bring his own girl. He doesn't get to touch Valarie except to fix this thing." 

 "Got it," Jay said. "Good luck guys. Oh, and thanks, Valarie." 

 "Anytime, sweetie," Valarie smiled.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut in Training Ch. 06 ****** bydlsloan© Chapter Six: All Hands on Valarie 

 Heeding the Coast Guard's warning, Travers had the boat headed toward the nearest dock, which they found at a small seaside village. They radioed their position to Jay, who called Dr. Pound. 

 "He'll be there in about an hour," Jay said. 

 Valarie tried not to look worried, but she was. She had seen Pound with his freakishly huge cock through the web cam, spraying absurd amounts of cum on those girls. He was mean-spirited, horny, dominating, and, scariest of all, incredibly smart. She had been intrigued by him over the phone and web, but the thought of meeting him was unnerving. At least Travers, Roy and Nelson would be there. They wouldn't let anything happen to her. 

 It was late afternoon now, so they agreed to grab an early dinner while they waited out the storm and waited for Pound. There was a small restaurant overlooking the beach, just off the pier. Valarie was still in the tiny pink bikini with the square 2 inch patches over her nipples and rectangular patch over her pussy, pink spaghetti straps and tiny silver chains holding the suit together. She added a pair of open-toed black heels with a three-inch stiletto heel and a tiny black strap around each ankle. 

 They sat in a corner booth and ate quietly. No one paid much attention to Valarie's skimpy suit. Sure, it wasn't every day that someone as hot as her walked in wearing a thong bikini, but it was at least a weekly occurrence in every beachside business. They ate quietly and Valarie wondered if everyone was just tired or if they were as worried about meeting Pound as she was. She knew that none of them liked him or trusted him, which worried her. 

 They were all stunned when the doctor himself entered the restaurant and strode directly to him. It was only when he flashed the handheld GPS unit that they realized how he had found them so easily. 

 He didn't bother to say hello or shake hands, he just sat down, stared at Valarie and said, "So, you've been a busy little slut today, haven't you?" 

 "Um, yes sir," she said meekly. 

 "Look, Pound, can you turn that thing off or take it out?" Travers interjected, wanting to ease everyone's tension and get this over as soon as possible. 

 "I don't know," Pound said. "We'll have to do a thorough examination. Just so happens that a colleague of mine has an office nearby. He's out of town, but he already said I could use it. So, shall we?" 

 He stood up and walked toward the door, not waiting for them to follow him. Valarie and the others didn't hurry to catch up, but did pay their bill and follow him out the door. He led them down the street about five blocks before they came to a doctor's office. Sure enough, he knew the entry code and soon they were in the examining room. 

 "Gentlemen, you can wait in the lobby," Pound said. "I received your communication from Jay and I assure you no harm will come to your precious piece of ass. After all, I brought my own." 

 Just then two beautiful women walked out. Both were dressed like nurses, if all nurses wore high heels, thigh-highs, mini skirts, no panties, and white button- down blouses with no buttons or bras. They looked like had walked right off the set of a porno movie. 

 "Please, put your tongues back in your mouths and say hello to Frankie and Candi," Pound said in his typical arrogant tone. "They are my nurses, employees, fuck sluts, cum sponges and sperm extraction specialists. They will be assisting me today and, if your little slut gets me all hot and bothered, will see to my needs so she may remain pristine and unspoiled by my foot-long cock." 

 "We're still coming with you," Travers said. 

 "No, you're not," Pound said. "If you must, you may watch on the web cam in his office. But if she gets a sight of me and can't resist herself, well, sorry boys, but the lady's wish will be my command." 

 "Just fix the Sweet Heat," Travers said. 

 Pound and his nurse whores left and Travers, Roy and Nelson went to the doctor's office. Sure enough, they could see the exam room on the screen. Valarie was sitting on the exam table, swinging her legs, nervously waiting for Dr. Pound. 

 He entered with his nurses moments later. "All right, Valarie, before we do anything else, I need to get a few basic numbers. So, stand up and let's get a good look at you." 

 Frankie and Candi moved in and stripped off her bikini and removed her heels, leaving her completely naked. Pound moved in with a tape measure and began measuring her breasts, her waist, height, etc. 

 "Why the fuck does he need to do all that?" Travers said, pissed. 

 "Because that's what he does," Nelson said. "Relax, let him have his little fun, fuck the hell out of his whores while we watch and get his kicks. So long as he doesn't hurt Valarie and fixes that damn Sweet Heat, we'll be all right. We'll get some rest tonight and get out of here in the morning." 

 They looked back at the monitor to see that Pound had four thermometers in Valarie -- one in her mouth, one in her pussy and one in her ass. The fourth was pressed between her breasts with Frankie squeezing them together around the thermometer. 

 "Gotta know where the hot spots are," Pound joked. "So, eight orgasms today. You sure you want me to take that thing out of you. Seems to me like you're having a good time." 

 "I like it, sir," Valarie said, "but we lost the remotes and it won't stop and it's driving me crazy. So, if taking it out is the way to make it stop, that's what I want to do. Maybe we could put another one in when we get back from our trip if you want." 

 "I see," Pound said. "Well, let's just have a little look, shall we? Lay back now. That's it. Girls, her legs, please." Frankie and Candi obediently grabbed Valarie's legs and pulled them apart, exposing her pussy for the arrogant doctor. He peeled back her labia, fully exposing her clit. "Little thing sure is spinning, isn't it? And I see the boys turned the heat on for you too. Yes, I can see that must be very sensitive." 

 "Yes, it's been on for hours," Valarie said. 

 Pound touched her raw, exposed clit and she shuddered. He touched it again and she flinched, the pleasure so strong it hurt. He stuck his finger inside her, feeling for the implant which by now was firmly embedded in her vaginal wall. 

 "Well, I don't have a remote with me and I can't turn it off without taking it apart, so I think the best thing to do is remove it," Pound said. "Now, remember, you have a needle through your clit that we will have to extract and that little button inside you is embedded in your flesh. So, we're going to need to lubricate the area and use some special tools for extraction. Some of the procedures might seem a bit unorthodox, but I assure you they are absolutely necessary. Are you ready to proceed?" To help her make up her mind, Pound touched her clit and rubbed inside her pussy again. She flinched and he licked his finger. "Mmm, you are quite sweet, my dear, just like they said. That's good. That will make the process go much more smoothly, I believe." 

 Valarie had no idea how a sweet tasting pussy would make this easier, but the man didn't make a lot of sense to her. She just wanted the Sweet Heat out of her, however he had to do it. When he lowered his pants and exposed his monstrously large cock, she had second-thoughts. 

 "Frankie, Candi, please give her a dose of lubricant," Pound said. The naughty nurses scrambled to him and took their places, obviously having done this sort of teamwork before. Frankie knelt before him, sucking his cock, impressively taking three-fourths of it in her mouth while Candi knelt between his legs and sucked his balls. Valarie watched, trying to understand what this had to do with her, how his cock had gotten so enormous and how the nurses were able to service him so deftly with their mouths. None of it seemed real. 

 Pound tapped Frankie on the head, a signal, and she pulled her mouth off and took his cock in her hand. Candi knelt on the other side and together they aimed his penis like firemen working a hose, aiming it directly at Valarie's snatch. His thick, white spunk seemed to flow forever, spurting out at her in huge blasts that drenched her pussy mound, labia and clit. As soon as he finished, Frankie jumped between Valarie's legs and Candi knelt in front of Pound, sucking his cock, keeping it rock hard. 

 Frankie's tongue seemed to be everywhere at once, slurping cum off of Valarie and swallowing it down. Valarie squirmed and trembled, pleasured by the oral stimulation. As Valarie's pussy warmed up and her clit throbbed, Frankie cleaned off her pussy lips and mound, leaving the best for last. When she knew she was ready, Frankie clamped her lips around Valaries clit, sucking cum off it and feeling the hard-bodied brunette cum underneath her. 

 Valarie was still rocking through the intensely raw, almost painful orgasm when she felt a tug on her clit. She looked down and saw Dr. Pound holding up the needle with a pair of tweezers. "Got it!" he said. 

 "What? How?" Valarie said. 

 "Power of the orgasm," Pound said. "Barely felt me pull it out, did you?" 

 "No, I ...wow, that was amazing!" 

 "Good, so, now you trust me when I tell you I have to fuck your pussy to get the other half of the device out, right?" 

 "Fuck me? With that? Oh, I don't know. I've never..." 

 "You can take it, don't worry," Pound said. "Every girl thinks her pussy is so tight that it just can't handle a big cock and then I prove them wrong." 

 "But, I don't understand how it will help," Valarie said. 

 "Because I have this," Pound said. He showed her a metal ring that Frankie fastened around the base of his cock. The ring was smooth and flat except one slightly raised rubber hook at the top. It extended no more than a 16th of an inch up from his cock. 

 "This is a firm rubber piece that won't hurt your pussy, but will, if we get it lined up right, catch underneath that little device in there and pull it out, sort of like pulling a nail out of a board with a hammer. Now, it probably won't come out on the first try, so I'll have to keep working at it." 

 "Can't you just put the ring closer to the head of your cock, so you don't have to put so much in? Or maybe just on your finger so you don't have to fuck me at all?" 

 "It has to go on the end so we have better leverage -- once I hook and pull back, it will be more apt to pop off," Pound said. "As far as using my finger, well, it could possibly work but it would take longer and be less effective. It's like saying, why don't you use a screwdriver to hammer in that nail. Eventually, you could probably do it, but a hammer is much more effective. It's all about using the right tool." 

 Valarie was pretty sure Pound was just making up excuses to fuck her, which would have been OK if he wasn't such an ass and his cock wasn't so big. She was worried that be fucked by him would hurt worse than keeping the little spinning monster inside her. She bit her lip, unsure what to do. She looked at Frankie and Candi. Clearly these sluts had fucked him many times and looked no worse for wear. Frankie was a big-busted hard body and Candi was a stunningly beautiful woman with Indian features. 

 "All right," Valarie said. "I trust you. Just, please be gentle." 

 "Of course," Pound grinned, purposely looking at the web camera and grinning, taunting the guys in the office. There was a way into any pussy he wanted, Pound had always believed. And it wasn't rape. Deception, maybe. Dishonest, certainly. Immoral, of course. But illegal. No. That's what Travers and Nelson had helped demonstrate to keep him out of legal trouble and he was indebted to them. So, yes, he would take it easy on their precious Valarie. But he wanted them to know that not even they could tell him which pussy he could and could not fuck. And here, in a matter of only a few minutes, he had Valarie asking him to fuck her. Oh, how sweet it was to be an evil, horny genius! 

 He took his place between her legs. She was laying back, her eyes closed tight, like she was bracing for impact. "Just relax," Pound said, parting her pussy lips with the head of his cock. "I've had plenty of practice with this. I won't hurt you. In fact, you might ask me not to stop even after the extraction is complete." 

 Valarie didn't say anything, but felt the massive girth of his cock begin to slide into her, stretching her as it plowed into her with surprising ease. She felt like he must have six or seven inches inside her when he stopped. "Are you doing OK?" he asked. 

 "Yes, I'm fine," Valarie panted. She was surprised at how gentle he was being. 

 "Good," Pound said. "The last few inches are the toughest and I've found it works best..." his cock slammed into her, hard and fast and without warning, taking her breath away as he sunk to the hilt inside her.... "if I don't warn you ahead of time." 

 "Oh my ..." Valarie panted, struggling to gain control of her senses. 

 "It's all inside now," Pound said soothingly. "Relax. This might be the most pleasurable surgical procedure you'll ever have." He began moving his cock back and forth inside her, small strokes at first, rotating his hips in small circles, trying locate the device with this cock. When he felt it, he thrust fully into her, then pulled back hard and fast. The clip caught and tugged at the button, pulling it partially free. 

 "Good start," Pound said. "Let's try again." There was no slow approach this time. All 12 inches skewered into her in a single thrust, then he ripped backward again, but he was just off the mark and missed the button. He repeated the procedure 12 more times, watching Valarie closely, her eyes fluttering, nostrils flaring, lips parted slightly, panting like a little bitch in heat. When the button finally popped off with a mighty tug, so did Valarie, cumming hard and long while the button dropped to the floor and Pound ejaculated into a cup, filling it half full of his spunk. 

 "Here, drink this," he said, offering the cup to Valarie. She hadn't seen him cum in the cup and assumed it was water. Instantly, she realized it wasn't, but Pound held the cup to her mouth and had his other hand on the back of her head. "Drink it up, slut," he whispered in her ear so softly he knew no one else could hear. "Now, tell everyone how yummy it is." 

 He scared Valarie, so she followed orders, drinking the viscous fluid in great gulps. When it was finally gone and inside her belly, she looked around the room and smiled, feeling relieved that it was gone and so were the buttons in her clit and pussy. So relieved, that she sounded genuinely happy when she blurted out, "That was delicious!" 

 The doctor grinned and looked at the camera. "See boys, your little slut likes cum just fine. Guess you just gotta have the right stuff. Don't worry about feeding her for a while. I think she's full." 

 He turned off the computer and left the room, while Frankie and Candi helped Valarie put her pink bikini back on. 

 Pound met the irate men in the lobby, grinning as he zipped up his pants. "I won't even charge you boys for an office visit," he said. "Now, our little patient has been through a lot today, so she might be a little wobbly. If it were me, I'd still take her home and fuck her six or seven more times tonight, but you guys might want to take it easy on her. I get the feeling you rather like her. That's sweet -- almost as sweet as her little cunt is. She should be feeling fine in the morning and ready for whatever you guys can give her." 

 "You're an ass, you know it," Nelson said. Pound didn't respond. "If we want another device, we'll call you, all right?" 

 "I'll talk to you soon," Pound smiled knowingly. 

 Candi and Frankie emerged with Valarie, each holding an arm, helping the wobbly young woman out of the examination room, her body finely adorned with the tiny pink bikini and heels. She looked worn out, exhausted and incredibly beautiful all at once. 

 Roy and Nelson replaced the slutty nurses by her side and, without a word of goodbye to Pound, led Valarie out the door, Travers leading the way. 

 Once they were back on the boat, they sat Valarie on the semicircle couch and gave her some water and fruit. She was groggy and sore and exhausted, but Valarie also felt more alive than she ever had before. Her day had included an unbelievable number of orgasms, the largest cock she had ever seen, some of the most slutty, raunchy behavior she had ever been a part of and a beautiful, luxurious yacht. She felt alive, sexy and desirable. And now she felt safe and cared for, the three men around her tending to her needs, treating her like a queen, not some slutty whore they wanted to use and abuse. She was beginning to understand that this whole relationship with these three men was far more complex than she had thought before. 

 She assumed she meant nothing to them, was just a sex toy, another piece of ass. She assumed if she was of no use to them sexually, they wouldn't care about her. But they were showing her a different side. They had told her they cared about her, but she never really believed it until now. She could see how different they were with her than Pound had been. Now, she had no delusions that she was going to be pampered and babied the rest of the trip. By tomorrow, they would be horny and expecting her to deliver, teasing and pleasing at full capacity. And she looked forward to that more than ever. God, today's series of orgasms had been fun! But she knew when the excitement faded and everyone got tired and mellow, they'd still want her to be with them, to talk with them, have fun in other ways. She wasn't about to fall in love with any of the three, but she understood now that there was a genuine interest in her well-being and that they intended to maintain a line between use and abuse of her. Knowing that, she was ready to submit to anything they asked. She wished she wasn't so sore and tired. She wanted to show them all her appreciation right now. Well, tomorrow she'd thank them in a way she knew they would like. She nearly giggled in anticipation, then asked if they'd mind if she went to bed so she could get some rest and be ready to serve them tomorrow. 

 The next morning, Valarie woke up early, rising with the sun, the gentle rise and fall of the boat reminding her that they were on a boat and would be setting sail again today. She looked over and saw Roy sleeping next to her. Sweet that he had let her sleep all night and not tried anything. She noticed that her bikini top was pulled to the sides, her breasts exposed and wondered if he had touched her, played with her, looked at her in the night, maybe touched himself. The thoughts made her tingle and she slipped out of bed, excited for a new day. 

 She remembered her last waking thoughts from last night, her vow to herself to be a super hot, slutty, sexy, teasing and pleasing girlfriend/slut/whore for them today. 

 She stripped completely naked and quietly made her way up to the deck. She slipped on a pair of white stretchy, skin-tight leggings and some bright red, five-inch stilettos. The leggings hugged her ass and pussy, her dark lips partially visible through the shear white material. There was no one around the dock yet this early, but she knew that would change, so she went about her topless preparations quickly. 

 From the crate of toys and gadgets the guys had brought along, she rounded up a bottle of baby oil, two bottles of lube, a thick 8-inch dildo, a butt plug, a slender chain, a red leather collar, a pocket knife and a pair of handcuffs, setting all of the items on the table next to the u-shaped cushions near the back of the boat. 

 She kept looking around, making sure none of the guys had woken up and kept her eyes peeled for early morning risers along the dock. She could see people walking on the beach already in the distance, but no one close enough to see her. Her nipples were hard, no doubt due in part to the pleasantly cool morning air.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut in Training Ch. 06 ****** bydlsloan© She pulled down her leggings and poured some of the lube in her hand and rubbed it into her ass and pussy, driving her fingers inside herself, wanting to do more, but forcing herself to stop. She covered the dildo in lube as well and gently slid the oversized dick into her pussy. It filled her nicely. Then, she coated the short black butt plug and gently inserted that into her tight ass. It was the first time she had done so, but she was pretty sure the guys would get the message. They had been patient and waited long enough. If they wanted her ass, it was theirs to take. Prepping it with lube and a butt plug seemed both prudent and a good way of communicating. She wanted her display and her body to do the talking this morning. 

 She pulled her leggings back up, noting how the wetness between her legs quickly soaked through. With two of her holes already filled, she filled the third with a bright red ball gag that matched the color of her heels. 

 She put the red leather collar around her neck and put one wrist in the handcuffs. Just two more steps and the setup would be complete. She looked around again, nervous, but saw no one. Her body was trembling now, a bit cold, very nervous, and extremely excited. The anticipation of what would happen, the anxiety of being caught by the wrong person, it was all so intense. 

 She arranged the bottles of baby oil and lube and the pocket knife carefully on the side of the table, then tried to compose herself. She clipped one end of the thin silver chain around one of the table legs and then held the other end as she carefully positioned herself, laying across the table, her breasts mashed against the cold table top, her legs spread wide, heels flat on the deck. The chain barely reached, but she managed to clip it to the ring in the front of her collar. For the final step, she put her hands behind her back. One was already in the cuffs. She fumbled around, sliding the other hand into the other cuff, then slapped it against her ass, forcing the cuff to tighten around her wrist. 

 Now cuffed, chained, lubed, topless, gagged and spread wide, she was fully on display. She was thankful that the boat was turned so that she was furthest away from the pier. A passerby could possibly just think she was leaning over the table, maybe cleaning it or picking something up. But the early morning sun was glinting off the chain and handcuffs and the bright red heels, ball gag and collar were eye-catching. It would only take a second glance to see what was going on. Then what would happen? Would they think she had been kidnapped and needed help? Would they see an opportunity and have some fun? Would they take pictures or just watch and stare? She felt moisture between her legs. The potential humiliation, the extreme voyeuristic display, the almost certain intense fuck session to come all had her on edge, excited, scared, anxious and oh-so-horny. 

 She was facing the ocean and looked out over the beautiful blue water, trying not to think about how she looked from behind and who might be watching her right now. With the sound of the water gurgling against the hull and the birds squawking around the dock, hearing someone approach or even comment as they passed by would be difficult. 

 She jerked when she finally heard voices. Someone yelling from a distance - - probably the pier, "What are they doing to her?" Then Roy's voice, closer, "Guys, get up, we gotta go. Now." 

 She felt the engine start, could sense the scurrying behind her, pictured the lines being cast off while a small crowd of onlookers stormed up the dock for a closer look. Roy or someone frantically steering the boat, getting them away from the crowd. She didn't know how close her mental picture was to reality, but it was exciting to think that maybe she had been seen in this condition by complete strangers who would no doubt either want to fuck her or save her or both. 

 "Do you think they called it in?" she heard Roy call down from the helm. 

 "I don't know, probably," Travers said. "I guess if the Coast Guard shows up, we'll know. Just get us away from here for now." 

 They were at nearly top speed now, plowing through the water. Valarie felt the spray of the water, the cool breeze blowing over her. Then she felt hands - - four of them -- touching her and saw Travers and Nelson come into view, sitting in front of her on the couch. "Well, this is quite a nice surprise," Travers grinned. "It's good to see you taking some initiative young lady. Very creative, too. So, am I to assume that you request the presence of my cock inside you this fine morning?" 

 "Mmm-hmmm!" Valarie mumbled through the gag, hoping her bright, blinking eyes would send the right message. Of course, she thought, her soaked crotch probably gave them the answer they were looking for as soon as they approached her. 

 "You know, you're lucky we got up when we did," Nelson said, rubbing his hand on her smooth back. "There was quite a crowd gathering out there. Mostly guys. I'm not sure if they were thinking about taking their chances, calling the cops or what. I think they were still trying to decide when we came up. I saw a lot of cameras and camera phones, though. Probably got yourself a starring role on the Internet soon, my dear." 

 Valarie squealed through the gag and squirmed, surprised at how close she was to cumming just at the thought that so many guys had been checking her out without her even knowing it. And now, their friends would see it -- pictures and videos of her chained shamelessly on the deck of a yacht, spread wide, waiting for someone -- anyone -- to give her the fucking she needed so badly. 

 "Well, Coast Guard or no, it would be rude to turn down such a warm invitation," Travers said. Valarie assumed they were safely away from prying eyes when he dropped his swim trunks and stood naked before her. He rubbed his semi-erect penis against her face, rubbing her nose with the soft head of his cock. 

 Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Nelson pick up the pocket knife and circle behind her. "You thought of everything, didn't you girl?" he said, taking a close look at her ass and the wet pussy mound encased in the leggings. "Would you like to carve or shall I?" Nelson asked Travers. 

 "You may have the honors," Travers said. "I'm already starting on the stuffing." With that, he removed Valarie's ball gag and, before she could even take a breath, replaced it with his cock. "Looks like we've got a real juicy piece of meat to feast on today." 

 "Oh yeah," Nelson said. "The juices are pouring out right now. I like to drink a little juice with my breakfast. I might have to have a sip or two." 

 Valarie felt the tip of the knife pressed between her legs, lightly tracing up and down her slit, the sharp edge catching occasionally and tearing a little bit at a time. She expected Nelson to rip it open, yank out the dildo or butt plug and go to town. But no, he was being quite honest about his intentions to have a morning drink. He left for a moment, then returned and showed her what he had in his hand -- a straw. He knelt behind her and she felt his hands tear open the leggings a little wider, then his fingers spreading her pussy lips. He left the dildo inside her and slid the straw in alongside it. She heard slurping sounds and wondered if he actually got anything to drink. Either way, he smacked his lips and said, "Mmm, I love the taste of pussy in the morning!" 

 The straw was thrown down on the table and her leggings were shredded from crotch to the top of her ass in one quick, almost violent slash. 

 "Well, well," Nelson said. "Looks like our little angel is ready for some very naughty play. Think that ass is ready for action?" 

 Valarie wiggled her ass and moaned around Travers' cock. Travers pulled out, stuffing the gag back in her mouth and came around to take a look. "Should've known with all the lube. Well, Magellan, you made the discovery, you get to plant your flag first." 

 "I'm honored," Nelson grinned. "Thank you, kind sir. Don't mind if I do." 

 Valarie saw Nelson pick up the bottle of lube and she assumed he was rubbing it on himself. Travers put his cock back in her mouth and she felt Nelson pull her ass cheeks apart and gently pull out the butt plug. Her asshole gaped open for him and he quickly dumped more lube directly inside her, then shoved his cock halfway in, letting her tight ring snap shut around him. 

 Valarie knew Nelson's cock was about average size, but it felt huge inside her now. It didn't hurt, exactly, and she knew she had the abundance of lube and pre-stretching to thank for it. But she felt incredibly full, stuffed as she felt him swell inside her and slowly begin to move back and forth. She was grateful for his tenderness. She was OK, but she couldn't imagine a huge cock, like Dr. Pound's, doing this to her. Or even Cori's friend, Ty, whom Cori said had a 10-inch beast as thick as her wrist that he routinely reamed her out with. She had no reason to doubt Cori's story, but she didn't see how it would be possible to take such a prodigious pole up her ass. 

 She wanted to focus on the feeling of her first ass-fucking, but Travers was keeping her mouth and throat occupied with deep thrusts and occasionally stuffing his balls in her mouth. She had become comfortable with cock-sucking, but it was still not a natural act for her to deep throat. She had to concentrate, make herself relax and control her gag reflex. She gasped for breath when he pulled his cock out, but he never gave her more than a quick breath before filling her face again. These guys were extremely horny and were taking full advantage of her slutty invitation. She had made it clear she was ready to be used any way they wanted, and they were dropping their gentlemanly ways and fucking her with full force. 

 Nelson was now reaming her out with full thrusts, the gentleness replaced by an urgency and power that made her tremble. She felt her pussy clutching the dildo, wanting to make it move inside her, wanting it or something to rub her throbbing clit. She wanted someone to lift her off the table and tease her nipples. But she had set her own pleasure aside this morning. This was all about pleasuring the guys. Her time would come later, if they wanted it to. And if it didn't, well, then she would have to take pleasure in serving them. 

 "Ready to give her a try, now that I have her all stretched out for you?" Nelson asked. 

 "Oh yeah," Travers said. He pulled his rigid cock out of her throat and hurried around behind her. Nelson slowly pulled out of her and held her ass cheeks open, her asshole gaped open as Travers slid his spit-coated cock inside her. Nelson thoughtfully but hurriedly wiped his cock off with a damp towel, then not so politely pinched her nose as she opened up and took his cock deep in her throat. 

 "Damn, she's tight," Travers grunted. "Thought you reamed her out for me. Guess I shoulda known mine would be a tighter squeeze. Thanks for drilling the pilot hole for me, though. Hey, you gonna let her breath or what?" 

 "Oh yeah," Nelson said, finally letting go of her nose and pulling his cock out for a second. "Sorry Val. Got lost in paradise there for a minute. Ready now?" He didn't wait for her answer. 

 Valarie couldn't tell if it was the waves or two powerful cocks, but they had her rocking and rolling, her body pushed and pulled, stretched and poked and teased until finally, Travers reached his peak. He pulled out and shot his load into a clear, empty glass on the table. A few minutes later, Nelson added his load. Valarie wondered if they would make her drink it now or were going to wait until they added more. 

 Both men wiped their cocks off in her hair, leaving sticky white streaks in her matted hair. They put the ball gag back in her mouth, left the dildo in her pussy, but didn't put the butt plug back in. Of course, Roy still hadn't had a turn and she knew just like they did that he'd want to tap her ass for the first time, too. 

 "Go ahead, Roy-boy," Nelson said in a happy sing-song voice. "I'll take the wheel." 

 She heard Roy approach and remembered that his cock, though not huge, was the biggest of the three. Was she ready for this? 

 "I can't believe your manners, guys," Roy taunted his co-horts. "Look at this pussy. Totally neglected. Her clit is practically dancing and her lips are so wet they feel like a slip and slide. I bet I don't fuck her for more than a minute before she cums." 

 "Well, aren't you the gentleman," Travers teased back. "Just be sure you can hold your wad for more than a minute, too, or you'll miss that little treat she gave us today. Gotta say, it's the tightest I've had." 

 "Oh, I'll get my turn, don't worry," Roy said. "I just find that a woman with a happy pussy is always eager to show her gratitude." 

 With that, she felt the dildo be removed and replace almost instantly by Roy's familiar steely rod. It felt so good, her heart skipped a beat and she arched her back the few inches her bonds would allow. "That's it, cum you little slut. You know you want to," Roy sneered, grabbing her cum-matted hair and giving it a little tug as he planted himself deep in her pussy. 

 "I thought it was going to take less than a minute," Travers said. 

 Without a word, Roy pulled his cock out of her pussy and rubbed the top of his cock along her clit, like a bow over a fiddle string. After only a few "notes", Valarie cried out through her ball gag, cumming in waves more powerful than any the ocean was throwing at them so far. 

 "Told ya," Roy said. "Now, watch this happy little bitch show me how much she appreciates the generosity of my mighty magical wand of steel." 

 "She appreciated the hell out of mine," Travers said. "Enjoy the ride, my boy. Might want to douse on some more of that lube -- we fucked her pretty raw, I think." 

 "Well, yeah," Roy said. "Took you guys long enough. I didn't think I was ever going to get a turn. We have her any time we want, you know. You don't have to make it last all day every time." 

 "When you get older, you'll learn to bask in the moment and not rush things," Travers said. "Don't worry about me, I feel like I could fill that glass all by myself today." 

 "Think I might beat you to it," Roy said, coating his cock with lube. He dumped some more at the top of Valarie's ass crack and watched it seep between her firm round globes. He pulled her cheeks apart and pressed his middle finger against her tight opening. "Open up and say ahh," Roy teased. He wriggled two fingers inside her, then turned twisted them, opening her wider. He used both hands to pull her cheeks apart and nodded for Travers to help. 

 Travers obliged, pouring lube straight into her asshole while Roy rubbed it up and down her crack with his cock. Then he let go of her cheeks and let her ass swallow up all that slippery lube. "Let's let that marinate and warm up for a minute," he said, rubbing his cock against her ass cheek. "I don't think I've had my morning kiss yet," he said next. He walked around in front of her, removed the ball gag and held his balls to her lips. She kissed them, then licked them, then, when he didn't pull away, sucked them. Then he pointed his cock down and she kissed and licked and then sucked the head, then the shaft. 

 "Good morning to you, too," Roy laughed, lightly "kissing" her cheek with the head of his cock, leaving a dab of pre-cum behind. He put the ball gag back in and moved back behind her. 

 "Hmm, let's see if this little ass of yours is all it's cracked up to be," he chuckled at his own joke. He pulled her cheeks apart again, then pressed the head of his cock against her opening. Travers and Nelson had entered her with her asshole already gaping open for them. This was the first time a cock was actually pushing through her opening. She was surprised how hard and strong his cock felt. There was no give to it, and finally her asshole yielded and his head poked inside her. He kept pressing firmly, steadily and she felt every inch rub past her opening and stake its claim inside her most intimate of places. 

 But Valarie didn't feel violated or used or abused. She felt wanted. Not loved, but cared for with a healthy mix of respect and lust that seemed to work with this odd trio of men. She felt safe, though their was inherent danger in binding herself like this in the middle of nowhere. No one knew where she was or what she was doing. These men could do anything to her and she couldn't stop them nor would anyone see. She allowed herself to picture them as ruthless pirates for just a moment, having their way with her, keeping her aboard their ship as nothing more than a cum vessel for the crew. Roy was doing his part, tearing into her ass harder than either of the other men had, his thicker, slightly longer cock making a definitive statement about just how her ass was to be used from now on. 

 Valarie came moments before Roy did, wondering if the fact that she came while being butt-fucked made her any more of a slut than allowing three men to fuck her ass one after the other did. While she rode another wave of pleasure, Roy made waves in the glass, nearly doubling the amount of cum in it. 

 Now that all three men had taken their turns and donated their load, she wondered if they would untie her now. Would they make her drink the cum? What would the rest of the day be like. She hoped the ass fucking was over for the day, but she doubted it. She had given them a taste of something new and they seemed to like it. A lot. 

 These thoughts were still going through her head when she heard Nelson call out, "Here comes the Coast Guard again." 

 Valarie heard the guys scurrying around, putting on their clothes, tidying up. But they made no move to unchain her or cover her up. 

 "Sorry, sweetie," Nelson whispered in her ear. "There's not enough time. They're almost here. Just play it cool. You convinced the others to take it easy on us. I'm sure you can work your magic again." 

 While she would liked for the guys to have made more of an effort, she found it exciting to think she would be on display for these men -- she assumed they would all be men -- and that her own guys were counting on her to help them. She wouldn't let them down. Moments later, she heard the motor and voices very close by and realized that Nelson had been right -- there would not have been enough time. Surely the Coast Guard would have had their binoculars on her long ago and new exactly what was going on. Heck, they probably saw Roy fucking her ass and cumming in the glass. She wondered if they had been able to tell she was having an orgasm too? The thought of that sent tremors through her body. 

 "Well, I'll be damned, Gentry wasn't bullshitting after all," Valarie heard one of the men say. "They really are fucking a hot babe on this boat." 

 "Good morning, gentlemen," Travers said. "Welcome aboard. I guess we all know why you're here. Sorry about the incident at the dock this morning. We overslept and didn't get out of sight as quickly as we expected. Hope we didn't offend too many folks." 

 "We got a few complaints, but most were just concerned that you gentlemen were holding this young woman against her will." 

 "Of course not," Travers said. "I understand that this might look a little, um, extreme to some folks, but I assure you everyone is here of their own free will and no one is being forced to do anything they don't want to do." 

 "We heard about you, all right. Heard you had a real looker on board who was as slutty as she was hot. Seems like this is one sea story that really is true." 

 "I think it's fair to say that Valarie is both extremely beautiful and extremely, um, enthusiastic about her sexuality, yes," Travers said. "I'm sure your co-workers shared the fact that she demonstrated her enthusiasm for them." 

 "They did." 

 "And since you know we're not causing any harm and yet you stopped us anyway, I assume you would like to receive the same kind of treatment," Travers said.  

 

 ****** The Sweet Slut in Training Ch. 06 ****** bydlsloan© "We would." 

 "Well, even though she can't speak for herself at the moment, I'm quite confident that Valarie will be happy to extend you and your men the same courtesy. My only instruction will be the same as it was with your co-workers - - no rough stuff." 

 "Fair enough. We don't have a lot of time. Any issue with the three of us going at once?" 

 "Three is a number Valarie was built to accommodate," Travers smiled. "Please, be gentle and enjoy. Oh, and when you're finished, if you wouldn't mind leaving your deposit in the glass, that will help keep things clean and provide for some entertainment later." 

 Three at once? Valarie couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her back and legs ached from being in this position. Her ass was sore and raw. Her jaws were tired. But her mission, her duty, was clear. What was it Travers had said? "She was built for this?" The thought warmed her. 

 The men from the Coast Guard didn't bother to say hi or introduce themselves. To them, she was just an object, a tool to get off. They unclipped her neck chain and stood her up. She felt instant relief in her back and the back of her legs. A slender black man lay on the table, naked, his cock hard and sticking straight up. The other men lifted her up and lowered her onto him as he guided his cock into her wet pussy. When she was all the way on, they bent her forward until her breasts mashed against the man's chest. A second man, this one tall and nicely built with dark hair, stood by the other man's and wagged his semi- erect cock in her face. The third -- a hairy, beefy man she knew by process of elimination -- was behind her, hands on her ass cheeks. 

 A minute later, all three cocks were placed snuggly inside her warm, willing body, each finding immense pleasure in what her body had to offer. Valarie tried to focus on what she was doing, rocking and rolling her hips, squeezing with her pussy, sucking and licking just right, but it was difficult. Her mind reeled with images of penises entering and leaving her body, hundreds of them finding and creating new openings, each providing new waves of pleasure. 

 "Sure is a nice little slut you have here," the beefy guy said. Valarie realized that Roy, Travers and Nelson must be nearby, watching, no doubt enjoying the show but also making sure she was safe. 

 "We think so," Nelson said. 

 "We appreciate you sharing her with us. It can get a little boring out here sometimes." 

 "No problem. Valarie understands that women like her -- so beautiful and fit and energetic -- have an awful lot to offer and can bring pleasure to so many. She has a very big heart." 

 "And tight ass," Beefy man said. 

 "I think she's going to cum," the black man said. 

 Hearing the men talk about her, feeling those cocks pound and stroke and fill her, had been too much for Valarie. She came again and the men high-five each other. 

 "Fuck, that's hot," the black man said. "Hurry up guys, I can't hold off much longer." 

 Beefy man needed to hear no more, pulling out of her ass and squirting a sizable load into the glass. The dark-haired man almost didn't make it, his first blast hitting her tongue before he dropped the rest of the load in the glass. Valarie dutifully swallowed what he had been kind enough to give her. Finally, they lifted her off the black man and he poured several creamy blasts into the glass, six loads of semen mixing happily together. 

 Five minutes later, they were dressed and gone and Valarie was again alone on the open sea with her three masters/friends/lovers. Her hands were still cuffed, the ball gag was still in, but she was free to move about now, naked except for her red heels. She eyed the nearly half full glass of cum and wondered what they had in store for her next. Report_Story
