Tessa
============
#1 

===

Tessa and I met in a college bookstore and while I can't say that it was love at first sight on her part I did fall for her enough to immediately ask her for a date. The outcome of that date was several more and we progressed to the point of going steady and from there we moved to engaged. 

The wedding was planned for six months after graduation, but it never came off. Three months before graduation Tessa broke our engagement, called me a "pig", tossed her engagement ring at me and stormed off. My high crime? I went to a bachelor party for a friend and it turned raunchy. They had arranged for a stripper and after she did her little number she was offered money to give the groom to be a blow job and she did it. In fact, she did it so well that everyone there wanted one too, including me, but I abstained, not because I didn't have the hundred bucks, but because I was staying true to Tessa. Tessa heard about the party, wouldn't believe that I didn't take part, called me a disgusting pig and bailed out on me. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was broken hearted, but I was young and I got over it although on the day we were supposed to wed I did go into a kind of funk that lasted a day or two. I began dating again, but never found me a girl who excited me enough to make me want a long-term relationship. Most of them seemed to be the female counterpart of me - looking for a good time and some casual sex - not wanting to make anything permanent at that time of their lives. 

Life was good. I was getting laid enough to keep me happy, I had a good job, a great apartment and I lived in a part of town that everything I liked or wanted to do was within walking distance. About two years went by and then my life changed again. 

I was attending a bachelor party for one of the guys I work with and after two hours of beer drinking and poker playing the door bell rang and when it was opened there stood a female police officer who said the neighbors had called and complained about the noise. 

"Just what is going on here anyway?" 

"It is just a bachelor party for Brian." 

"Who is Brian?" 

Brian was pointed out to her and she said, "Did he get a stripper as part of the party?" 

"No, we are just drinking beer and playing cards." 

"I'm not sure, but I think it is against the law to have a bachelor party without a stripper." 

Suddenly music began playing and she moved into the room swaying to the beat. She took off her hat and tossed it to the side and her long dark hair fell to the middle of her back. Her gun belt hit the floor and then the rest of her uniform came off piece by piece until she was down to an almost non-existent bra and a thong. 

I guess there was a pre-arranged signal because suddenly two guys grabbed Brian and sat him down on a straight backed chair while the dancer did several slow turns in front of him and shook her tits back and forth in front of his face. She peeled off her bra and tossed it to one of the two guys holding Brian down and he used it to tie Brian's hands behind his back. Then the dancer gave Brain a lap dance that would have made a stone statue cum for an hour. 

When the music stopped the dancer disappeared into the bedroom and came out five minutes later in jeans and a sweatshirt. She gathered up her uniform, packed it in a bag and then she joined the guys at the makeshift bar for a drink. 

I was standing in a corner watching her and I saw her eyes fly wide-open when they swept the room and she saw me. She left the bar and came over to where I was standing. 

"How are you Bobby?" 

"Fine Tessa, yourself?" 

"Not bad." 

"I see you have put your Computer Science degree to good use." 

"That's my daytime job Bobby." 

"When did you overcome your disgust of stag parties and those who attend them?" 

Before she could answer Dave, the guy who had set up the party, came up and asked Tessa if she would take three hundred to haul Brian's ashes and I took he opportunity to slip away. As I was walking away I heard her say, "Sorry, I don't do that sort of thing." Dave then raised the offer to five hundred but I was out of hearing by the time Tessa answered. 

I was just stepping into the elevator when Tessa came running out of the apartment and down the hall toward me hollering, "Wait Bobby, please wait." 

I pushed the button for the lobby and the door slid shut just as Tessa got there. I heard her fists pound on the door and heard her voice, "Damn it Bobby!" as the car began to move down. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Seeing Tessa had been as much a shock to me as what she was doing when I saw her. The party had been on a Friday night so I had the weekend to recover, but my recovery was short lived. Monday morning when I got to work I found Tessa in the lobby of our building waiting for me. I saw her too late to turn around and leave and both elevators were already going up so my only option was to head for the stairwell and walk up to the seventh floor. I managed to get through the door and up one flight of stairs before I heard Tessa holler up at me: 

"You are wasting your time Bobby. I know where you are now so you might as well talk to me because I'm going to be around until you do." 

I almost stopped long enough to yell down to her that we had nothing to talk about, but I didn't. I climbed until I got to the third floor and then I moved out into the hall and pushed the button for the elevator. When I got off the elevator on the seventh floor Tessa was standing there waiting for me. 

"Why are you running from me Bobby?" 

"Because I don't want to see you or talk to you. Now if you will excuse me I need to get to work." 

"Well I'm sorry that you don't want to see me or talk to me, but you are going to have to because I'm going to dog your footsteps until you do." 

I could see she was determined so I said, "There is a lunchroom across the street. I have lunch there every day from twelve to twelve forty-five" and then I pushed past her and headed for my office. 

I spent most of my morning wondering what the hell Tessa wanted with me. It had been almost three years since I last saw her and my last memory from back then was her throwing her engagement ring at my head just before she stomped out the door to my apartment. 

I got to the lunchroom at five to twelve and slid into a booth. I looked around and didn't see Tessa anywhere. I had just about decided that my frosty tone when I talked to her had convinced her she would be wasting her time when I saw her come in the door, look around and spot me. She slid in across from me and I sipped my Diet Coke and waited for her to speak. She looked at me for several moments and then said: 

"I've missed you Bobby." 

"If memory serves me correctly Tessa, that was your choice." 

"I know Bobby and it was a bad one. I found out later from some of the other guys who were at that party that you really didn't do anything. I tried to find you, but you had dropped out of sight. You aren't in the phone book, the Alumni Association didn't have anything on you and your parents wouldn't even speak to me. I looked for over a year before I gave up and then I saw you Friday night and after you left I bugged everybody there until they told me where I could find you." 

I just sat there and sipped my Coke and looked at her. 

"I know I hurt you Bobby and I'm sorry. I hurt myself too. I've never gotten over you Bobby." 

"What is it you want Tessa?" 

"I want you Bobby. I want you to forgive me and I want you back." 

"Maybe you don't Tessa, I'm not the same person I was back then." 

"Neither am I Bobby, but maybe the changes in us are for the better. All I know is that I've found you again and I want you back - I want you to take me back." 

"I don't know Tessa. I've managed to get over you. Why should I put myself back where you can shaft me again? You didn't trust me once, why should I believe that it won't happen again?" 

"Because I know now what being without you is like and I don't want to go through that again. I can't push you into something you don't want Bobby, all I can do is tell you that I'm sorry for what I did to you, that I still love you and that I miss you and I want you back in my life. That's all I can do. The rest is up to you." 

She pushed a piece of paper across the table to me. "Those are my phone numbers; home, cell and work. The other place you can reach me is at the Top Hat Club on Eighth and Broadstreet. They won't take phone calls, but I dance there four nights a week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. Think about it Bobby and call me, even if it is to say no." 

Then she slid out of the booth and walked away. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I did think about it. I thought about it a lot and the end result was that I didn't know what to think. It was almost a surprise to me when I found myself standing on the corner of Eighth and Broadstreet outside the Top Hat Club. The garishly lit sign said: 

Topless Dancers Monday thru Saturday Noon to 1:30 AM 

I paid a ten dollar cover charge to get in and found a seat in a dark corner where I could watch what was going on without being noticed. I gambled on the big tippers sitting close to the stage so that was where the dancers would go to try and make their money on lap dances and they would stay away from where I sat. I watched Tessa dance four sets and do several lap dances and a half hour before closing I got up and left. 

On the way home I pondered on the lessons of the evening. I'd watched five dancers do their sets and lap dances, but Tessa was the only one who gave me a hard on while doing it. And Tessa wasn't even the best looking one there. I went back on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday and the same happened. The other women would dance and nothing happened, but as soon as Tessa hit the stage I became iron bar hard. 

It was Saturday night and I had just watched Tessa give a lap dance before going back stage. I was sitting there with a throbbing hard on when a gorgeous and extremely well built blonde sat down at the table and set a fresh drink down in front of me. 

"I don't recall ordering another drink." 

"You didn't, but I've learned that if I come bearing gifts it smoothes the way." 

"The way needed to be smoothed?" 

"You tell me. My name is Marla and I own the place. My bouncer is worried about you so I'm here to decide whether or not his worries are justified." 

"I've seen the bouncer. I could hurt him about as bad as a rubber raft could hurt an aircraft carrier." 

"That's not the worry sweetie. You fit the classic pattern of a stalker. You have been here four times this week and you pick dark corners to sit in and watch my girls. You don't approach them, try to flag their attention for a lap dance, you just sit, sip your drink and watch. Harry thinks you are stalking one of the girls." 

"Actually that's not too far from the truth. I am here because of one in particular, but I'm not stalking." 

"Judy or Tessa?" 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"Is it Judy or Tessa?" 

"Tessa, but how could you know that?" 

"It's simple. You have been here every night but Friday and only Judy and Tessa work those days and have Friday off. What's your interest in Tessa?" 

"Just an old friend." 

She stared at me, "Hang on a second, it will come to me." She closed her eyes and concentrated and several seconds later her eyes popped open and she said, "Bobby, right?" 

"You clairvoyant or something." 

"No sweetie, I'm just real close to my girls. Tessa was a basket case when I met her because of a Bobby. Saturday she came to work happier than a pig in shit. Tuesday she was nervous and Wednesday she was extremely irritable. Thursday she was way down in the dumps and tonight she is weepy eyed and all of a sudden here you are. I put two and two together and guessed that four might be the answer. Care to tell me why she is all weepy eyed tonight?" 

"You would have to get that from her, not me." 

"And if I got up to do that I'm guessing you would be gone by the time I got back?" 

I sat here and looked at her for almost a minute and then I said, "No, I'll still be here." 

She raised an eyebrow at that and then made some sort of signal and a cocktail waitress appeared. "My sheet" she said and she got up and disappeared. 

"What did that mean?" I asked the waitress. 

"Every drink that's poured has to be accounted for. She just told me that your drinks are on the house, but I still have to account for them so they get listed on her sheet on a clipboard behind the bar. You somebody important?" 

"Only to me. Why?" 

"Marla almost never buys a drink and when she does it is almost always someone important. What'll you have?" 

"Jack, water by." 

"She wrote it down on her pad and hurried away. 

Ten minutes later Marla was back. "You could have saved the poor girl some tears if you had just called." 

"Hadn't made up my mind yet that I was going to call." 

"But you have now?" 

I was quiet for a second or two and then said, "Yes, I believe I have." 

"Instead of calling, why don't you stick around until the end of her next set. I'll cut her loose early tonight." 

I hesitated and made a face, I really wasn't ready. 

"Come on Bobby, you can't beat the drink price and if she's smiling when you leave I'll make it worth your while." 

I sat. Tessa finished her set and came straight from the stage to me, her bra less tits swaying from side to side which made my cock harder than it already was. Tessa sat down at the table and said: 

"Can I take this as a good sign?" 

"You can take it as a couple of old friends meeting up Tessa. Maybe you can take it as a start. Whether it goes anywhere will depend." 

"On what?" 

"Neither one of us is the same person that the other knew three years ago. Take you. Three years ago you wore baggy clothes to hide your body and tonight here you are sitting naked at a table with me in a room full of men. A week ago yesterday the same girl who slapped my face for kissing her in public was naked and dry fucking a guy tied to a chair while fifteen guys cheered her on. Three years ago you threw your engagement ring in my face because I went to a bachelor party where they had a stripper and now you are a stripper and that's just the stuff I know about. I don't even know if I'm going to like the new you." 

"Have you changed Bobby?" 

"Of course I have." 

"In what way?" 

"That's for you to find out Tessa. That's why it's only a start." 

"Will we have to waste time on first and second dates? Or can we learn about the changes while we are doing it." 

"What do you mean?" 

"I haven't been made love to since you left Bobby and I don't want to waste any more time." 

"Marta said she was letting you off early. Why did you waste time coming to my table like this if you are in such a big hurry?" 

"Because I didn't know if we would be leaving together. A lot of the guys in here are regulars and big tippers. If I walked over here dressed and then left with you it would be bad for my pocket book. I'll go get dressed. You give me ten minutes and then meet me in the parking lot." 

While Tessa was dressing Marta came back and sat down. "She's smiling so here, this is for you" and she passed me a card. 

"What's this?" 

"It is a courtesy card. Gets you in without having to pay a cover, gets you drinks for half price and gets you free lap dances on Friday nights if you are sitting in the front row." 

"Why on Fridays?" 

"Because that's the only night I dance sugar. It's the night I have to cover for Tessa and Judy. Be nice to her sugar, and I'll be nice to you." 

She got up and left before I could ask her what she meant. 

I met Tessa in the parking lot and said, "Your car or mine?" 

"Neither. Even though Marta runs a clean place the vice cops watch it. If anyone is watching tonight my leaving with some body would be like waving a red flag at them." 

She gave me directions to her place and told me she would meet me there. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

And that is how the weirdest relationship I've ever been in got started. Tessa and I met at her apartment and she was shedding clothes before the door was fully closed. 

"Hurry up Bobby, it's been too long. We can talk later, but for now get naked. Hurry Bobby, hurry." 

The first time was frantic, the second time not so frantic, but still a little on the urgent side as indicated by the speed with which Tessa went after my cock with her mouth to get me up again. The third time was more like what it had been like when we were engaged. It started out slowly with me licking Tessa's sensitive nipples and then tracing a pattern down her body with kisses. I stopped at her belly button and licked it and she shivered just like she had three years ago. I went from her belly button down her right leg and across the top of her right foot and then worked my way up the bottom of the leg. I drug my tongue the length of her slit and then I did her left leg like I had done her right and ended up at her pussy. By then she had her hands in my hair and was moaning and asking me to please fuck her, but I wanted to do something to her that I had never done before. I buried my face in her pussy and started eating her. 

"No Bobby, don't do that. I'm all messy down there." 

"It's all right baby, it's my mess and I'm not afraid of it. 

"Its nasty Bobby, you shouldn't do that. Why don't yoooooooooooo..." and her words turned into a moan as I latched onto her clit and started working on it. I spent another couple of minutes licking and sucking on her pussy and she stopped complaining and her hands on my head were now pulling me to her instead of trying to push me away. I gave her an orgasm and as she was settling down from it I moved up and slid my cock inside her. 

"Yessssssss" she hissed as I started stroking in and out of her. Her legs came up and gripped my hips and her arms came up and went around my neck. "Oh yes Bobby, oh yes, it's so good Bobby, so good." 

When the third time was done she said, "You're staying the night aren't you? Please Bobby?" 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I woke up in the morning we were all tangled up in each other and it led to a morning romp following which I took her out to breakfast. Over coffee we caught up on what had happened over the last three years. In my case it was pretty uneventful. Got a job, dated some and that was about it. Tessa's wasn't even close to uneventful. 

"I was so mad when I broke it off with you that I swore off men altogether and buried my self in school work. Maybe three months after graduation I was at a party and one of the guys asked me why he hadn't seen me with you in a while and I told him. He told me that you had been the only one at the party that had stayed away from the stripper. I wasn't sure I believed him so I looked up a couple of the other guys that had been there that night and got the same story from them. I knew then that I had screwed up big time and I went looking for you so I could crawl back and beg you to forgive me, but you were gone and no one seemed to know where. 

"I went to work as a systems administrator and one night on my way home from work I got into an accident and I needed to call a cab because my car had to be towed and the Top Hat was the only place around that was open. While I was there I decided to have a drink before calling a cab. I had three and suddenly I started crying. Watching the strippers reminded me of how I'd lost you. Marta came up and sat down with me and asked me what was wrong and I'd had just enough to drink to blubber out the whole story. I blamed strippers for ruining my life and Marla talked and talked with me until she had convinced me that there was a big difference between a whore who danced and a dancer who stripped. Then she talked me into trying it. I tried it and I liked it. I couldn't believe how much money I made that night. Since then it has been computers during the day and dancing five days a week for Marta."  

===

"Four." 

"Four what?" 

"Four days dancing. You have Friday off." 

"No I don't. Friday is special night. That's the night I do bachelor parties, birthday parties and things like that. Marta always has people asking her to set up those kinds of parties. Why are you looking at me like that?" 

"You said you have no love life." 

"So?" 

"You would never suck my cock when we were going together, but that was a pretty damn good hummer that you gave me last night. You had to learn somewhere and you had to practice a lot to get that good at it." 

Tessa was silent for several moments and then she said: 

"I said I didn't have a love life. I didn't say anything about not having a sex life." 

"Oh." 

"A girl can always find a cock to play with Bobby, but she can't always find someone to have a loving relationship with. I've never found anyone who could take your place Bobby; I've never even come close. Why aren't you married by now?" 

"I never found anyone that I wanted to make permanent." 

"Dare I hope that that's your cautious way of saying you've never been able to replace me?" 

I just looked at her - things were going way too fast for me - before I nodded my head yes. 

"Then we need to go back to my place and start playing catch up." 

We spent the afternoon making leisurely love and between sessions I learned a little more about the new Tessa. 

"I've become an exhibitionist Bobby. I get a major charge out of taking my clothes off in a room full of men and then walking around naked except for a G- string. Even when I'm not dancing I show myself off. Eighty percent of my wardrobe will have to be tossed now that I have you back." 

"Why would you do that?" 

"Because it is all pretty revealing. Low cut blouses, short skirts and high heels. I'm sure that you won't want to be seen with me while I'm looking like a slut." 

"Oh I don't know. I like what I've seen so far." 

She gave me a long look, almost like she was looking at me while debating something with herself and then she said: 

"Okay. You can take me to dinner tonight and we will see if you can still say that." 

To be continued.  

===

She looked like a whore getting ready to go stand on her corner. The only thing that kept you from automatically thinking 'cheap slut' was her relatively innocent looking face. I took one look at Tessa in a short skirt and an almost see thru low cut blouse and I was instantly iron bar hard. I gave a low whistle and said: 

"You go out looking like that and you don't get fucked within a block of this place?" 

"I told you I'm an exhibitionist and that I like to be looked at." 

"You certainly will be the center of attention tonight." 

And she was. At the restaurant all eyes were on us, the men looking at her and hating me because I had her and the women looking at her and hating her because she made all of them look plain and dowdy. We stopped at a lounge for a couple of drinks on the way back to her apartment and I'll swear I heard a hush come over the place when she walked in; it was momentary, but I'll swear that it happened. 

Over drinks I asked her how many lovers I was going to have to fight off if I stayed around. 

"None. I don't have lovers, I have semi one night stands." 

"What is a semi one night stand?" 

"If I liked a guy and thought he might have possibilities I'd date him for a couple of weeks and if I still liked him I'd go to bed with him. Usually by the second or third time I'd know he wasn't the one and I just wouldn't see him again. Now I don't have to do that anymore, do I?" 

"I don't honestly know Tessa. You've changed a lot in the last three years and I think I may need some time to see what other changes you may have in store for me." 

"Does that mean you will stick around to see?" 

"Yeah Tessa, I guess it does." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Over the next several weeks we settled into a routine. I spent the first week going to the Top Hat on the nights Tessa danced, but that got old in a hurry. For one thing I was drinking more booze than was good for me and for another I was getting precious little sleep. I'd leave the Top Hat ten minutes before she finished her last set, typically around one-thirty, so no one would see us leave together, and then go to either her apartment or mine and make love for an hour or so and then try and get some sleep before having to get up at six- thirty to go to work. 

By the end of the second week we had both decided we needed to regulate a few things. The nights she danced during the week I stayed home and went to bed early. Tessa would come to my place when she got off and get in bed with me and we would sleep until the alarm went off and then we would make love and go to work. 

Friday she did whatever special event Marla had for her and I would use that night to get family stuff out of the way - visit mom and dad, have dinner with my sister and stuff like that. Saturday I would go to the Top Hat about two hours before closing, watch Tessa dance and then we would go out for breakfast, go either to her place or my place and make love until we were exhausted and then sleep in late. 

On Sunday we would go out to dinner, maybe take in a show and then go back to either her apartment or mine make love once or twice and then sleep till the alarm went off, make love one more time and head off to work. Monday was my bowling night and Tessa used that time to take care of her family obligations. That is the schedule we stuck to for about three months and then one Sunday night things changed - drastically! 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It started out as a typical Sunday. We slept until almost ten. We woke up, made love and then got up and had breakfast and read the morning papers. Later we went out and did some shopping and then went back to her apartment and made love. When it was over we discussed what to do that evening. 

"Where would you like to have dinner?" I asked. 

"We haven't been to Scala's for a while." 

"Okay, Scala's it is. Then what?" 

"I'm in the mood for a movie." 

"Any particular one?" 

"No, not really. Let's see what kind of mood we are in when we finish dinner. I don't want to inflict another 'chick flic' on you so soon after the last one, but I don't want a blood, guts and gore movie either." 

Dinner was a leisurely affair and between the two of use we polished off a bottle of Merlot. Tessa settled on a movie and we left the restaurant and headed for the theatre. We were about halfway there when Tessa suddenly said: 

"I've changed my mind. I want to see that movie" and she pointed. 

I looked and saw it was the Bluebird Theatre, an adult movie house. The marquee said, "Classics Night. Limited engagement, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door." 

"You have to be joking," I said. 

"No I'm not. I'm probably the only adult in this country who has never seen them." 

"Okay, if that's what you want." 

We entered the theatre and move to a row that was occupied by one other man. He was sitting in the seat next to the wall and Tessa and I took the two seats on the aisle which put six seats between the man and Tessa. Half an hour after we sat down Tessa was staring at the screen with rapt attention. Whether she knew it or not she had started to play with herself. Her right hand was rubbing her tits and her left was down inside her skirt. Out of the corner of my eye I saw motion to the right and I looked over and saw that the man against the wall had his cock out and was jacking off. I nudged Tessa and when I got her attention I nodded toward the man and suggested that we move. She surprised me by saying no and then further surprised me by opening her blouse and loosening her bra. She started rolling her nipples between her fingers and she kept glancing over at the man by the wall, but he was staring at the screen. 

This apparently pissed her off. She pushed her purse off the seat next to her and on to the floor and said, "Oh shit!" which caused the man to look her way and see Tessa's tits hanging free as she bent to pick up the purse. Once she had his attention she went back to playing with her nipples as he watched and slowly stroked himself. Tessa stopped using both hands on her tits and dropped her left hand down to pull her skirt up to her waist. She moved the gusset of her thong aside and started playing with her pussy. After a couple of minutes of that she leaned over to me and whispered: 

"Is it hot in here, or is it just me?" 

"I think you already know the answer to that one." 

"Would you please go to the lobby and get me something cold to drink?" 

"I don't think I ought to be leaving you here alone." 

"Oh come on Bobby, you'll only be gone three or four minutes. Besides, I've got a good set of lungs and I can holler for help if need be." 

It was closer to eight minutes because the person who took care of the concession stand was also the person who sold the tickets and I had to wait for him to come back from the ticket booth. I found that things had changed some when I got back. Tessa had moved a couple of seats to her right and the man against the wall had moved left and there was now only one seat separating them. Two men had moved into the row in front of Tessa and they were on their knees on their seats and they were turned so they could watch Tessa. 

She had taken her thong off and was leaning back in her seat with her eyes closed and she was finger fucking herself. She was breathing heavily and as I came walking down the aisle I saw one of the men in front of Tessa reach out and caress her left tit. Tessa moaned and then her eyes shot open and she smacked the hand away. 

"Watch! All you can do is watch," and she went back to fingering herself. I took my original seat on the aisle which left empty seats between Tessa and me and I settled back to watch. For several minutes I watched as Tessa worked to get herself off and finally I saw her brace her feet against the seat in front of her, lift her hips and cry out as she had an orgasm. Then she relaxed and turned to the man who had been stroking himself while he watched her and said: 

"It's your turn now. Cum for me, cum for me sweetie, let me see you shoot." 

The guy must have been real close because he groaned and his cum shot out of his dick and flew all over the seat in front of him. Tessa watched until his cock went soft and then she turned to me: 

"Get me out of here Bobby, get me out of here and fuck me before I lie down in the aisle and let everybody." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Once in the car I said, "What in the hell got into you in there?" 

"I don't know Bobby. I told you that I had become an exhibitionist, but that was way out even for me. I don't know what came over me. I was watching him jerk himself off and suddenly I wanted him to watch me. I didn't even know about the two in front of me until the one man touched my boob. God, it was wild. I wonder if I did that at one of my bachelor parties I'd get bigger tips." 

"It might get you something, but you might want it or like it." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Hey, you were so lost in it that you didn't even notice those two guys move in front of you. What if you get lost in it at a bachelor party and instead of a hand touching your tit you get a dick shoved in you? Tonight when the guy touched you you slapped his hand away and he backed off. What are you going to do if you get lost in the moment, snap out of it to find a cock in you and the guy doesn't want to stop?" 

"I'll push him away." 

"What if he is too big to push away? What if the other guys at the party decide to hold you down and then take turns?" 

"I'll scream and I'll fight." 

"What? You think you are to only one who can get lost in lust? Once they start they probably won't stop. They may feel guilty when it's over, but the deed will still have been done." 

"You really think that could happen?" 

"I'd bet on it." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The following week went by much as the previous weeks had except on Sunday morning when I asked Tessa what she wanted to do she said: 

"I would like to do what we did last Sunday only a little different." 

"In what way?" 

"I want to go to an adult bookstore that has a video arcade. One of those places that has holes in the walls." 

"You mean 'glory holes'?" 

"Yes. I want to do nasty things to you while someone whose face I can't see watches." 

"What do you mean by nasty things?" 

"I want to suck your cock and fuck you." 

"Nasty is good. I can do nasty." 

Following dinner on Sunday, fortified by a bottle of a good Cabernet Sauvignon, we went to an adult bookstore on Seventh. There were eight men in the place when Tessa and I walked in and sixteen eyes looked at Tessa and I could almost see and hear the gears turning in the men's heads - "Is she going to? Can I get a taste?" Had anyone of them asked me that point blank I don't honestly know that I could said anything other than, " I don't have a clue." 

We went back into the arcade area and Tessa looked in to three vacant booths before picking one and it wasn't until we were inside and had locked the door behind us that I found out what she had been looking for. The booth had a booth on either side of it and both walls had glory holes. 

"Put some money in the machine Bobby, and let's find a good movie to watch." 

I fed five singles into the slot and then Tessa started pushing buttons until she came to a movie that showed a big-breasted blonde being double-teamed by two studs. There was only one folding chair in the booth and Tessa told me to sit down on it and take out my cock. I did and she bent at the waist and started sucking on it. After about a minute she whispered, "Look at the holes." A quick glance showed me that we were being watched from both sides. 

Tessa went back to sucking my cock for another minute or so and then she took off her skirt and panties and straddled me with her back to me and used a hand to guide me into her as she sat on my cock. She moaned as it slid into her and then she started fucking me. She raised and lowered herself while watching the blonde on the screen take a cock in her pussy and her ass at the same time. Tessa was breathing hard and softly moaning and then she gasped out: 

"Would you let me do that Bobby? Would you let me have two cocks in me at the same time? Oh God, that is just so fucking sexy. She should have three, shouldn't she Bobby? Shouldn't she have one in her mouth? Oh baby, I can't even imagine how she must feel. Can I do that someday Bobby? Will you let me?" 

I didn't know what to say. I was blown away by this totally new Tessa. Did she really want to do it? Why was she asking me if I'd let her? What say did I have? We were not engaged, just keeping company, and even if we were engaged or even married and she wanted to do it would my saying no matter to her? 

Tessa's moans turned into a low chant, "Cum for me Bobby, cum for me, cum baby, cum for me" as she began to slam herself down on my cock. "Come on Bobby, give it to me, cum for me baby" and then she said, "Oh God, there, over there, look Bobby, look over there." 

I looked where she was looking and I saw a hard cock sticking through the glory hole to out left. Still sliding up and down on my cock Tessa bent at the waist and leaned toward it. I really thought she was going to suck it, but two inches from it she stopped and stared at it. After maybe thirty seconds she blew her hot breath on it and then took it in her hand and began to slowly stroke it. 

Seeing what was happening the guy in the booth to our right slid his cock through the glory hole in his wall and waited for Tessa to notice. When she did notice she turned to the right and found that she couldn't lean down and look at it as she had done to the one on her left without letting go of the first cock and she didn't want to do that. She could however reach the second cock and wrap her fingers around it. Sitting upright on me with her arms straight out to the sides she couldn't stroke either cock, just hold them. 

So there we were. Tessa sliding up and down on my cock and begging me to cum in her while an unknown man on either side of us fucked her clutching hands. I was the first to cum and thirty seconds later the cock in Tessa's left hand spit all over the floor of our booth. A minute after that the cock on the right did the same. Tessa sat on my lap and shuddered as she climaxed and then she grabbed her thong, wiped her hands on it and tossed it on the floor. Slipping her skirt on she said: 

"Get me out of here Bobby, take me home and fuck my brains out. I need it Bobby, I need it bad." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

In the car she slid over next to me and took my cock out of my pants and started stroking it. 

"I wanted to Bobby. God, but I did want to. I wanted to suck both of those cocks. I wanted to bend over and back up to the wall so I could slide my pussy onto them. I thought about it Bobby, I really did. I would have taken the one on the left in my pussy and then I would have gone to the right and let that one have my ass. I wanted to do both of them Bobby, I wanted to do them both while I sucked your cock" and then she bent and took me in her mouth. 

She sucked on my cock all the way home. We did not make love when we got to my apartment - we fucked - we went at it like animals until I just absolutely could not get it up again. Just before we fell asleep I heard her say: 

"God, whoever would have believed I could become such a whore in only two years." 

As I drifted off to an exhausted sleep I thought she was just commenting on her sluttish behavior of the last two Sundays. Two weeks later I found out that I didn't know the half of it. 

To be continued.  

===

It was a Friday night, Tessa was doing something Marta had set up for her and I was at loose ends. Nothing good was on TV, I'd just finished the last book I had bought, and I didn't feel like staying home and staring at the walls. I decided to go out and have a few drinks and I was headed for the corner bar when I decided to go to the Top Hat instead. The place was packed, but the dark corner I favored was vacant and that's where I sat. The waitress came and took my drink order and I showed her my card. It had a number in the right hand corner and she wrote it down on her order pad and then left. 

I was watching a beautiful brunette make love to the pole when Marta sat down across from me. 

"Where have you been handsome? I give you a card that gives you free lap dances on Friday and you don't take advantage of it?" 

"I'm not sure that Tessa would approve of me being in here when she's not here." 

"Tessa afraid one of us other girls might try and steal you away?" 

"I think the real reason is that she wants to keep me away from you." 

"Oh you silver tongued devil you. I thought I told you that the free lap dances come if you are sitting on the front row?" 

"You did, but the front row is full except for the table with the reserved sign on it." 

"That table is reserved for special guests sugar and that's you. Come on, let's move you down there" and she picked up my drink and led me down front. Once I was sitting down she said, "Got to go sugar, the next set is mine. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

She came on stage in a sequined dress that looked as if it had been painted on her. With every swaying step she took to the music the dress shimmered and sparkled. Her movements were slow and sensual and her eyes seemed to be looking at every man in the house and saying, "This could be yours if you were the right kind of man. Are you?" 

Her strip was hot and there wasn't a soft cock in the house. The highlight, at least for me, was after she had shed the dress and moved to the pole and took it between her beautiful breasts. She moved up and down with her tits caressing the pole much as they would if she was giving a man a tit fuck. As her tits surrounded the pole she moved her lower body forward until her crotch was against the pole and then she rubbed the pole with her pussy. She had on the smallest g-string that the law would allow and the front split her pussy lips the same way a thong would ride between butt cheeks and her pussy lips stood out for all to see. As she rubbed her tits up and down the pole and rubbed her pussy against I couldn't understand why the damned thing didn't melt. 

She left the pole and moved to the edge of the stage and shook her bare tits and almost naked pussy to the customers in the front row who scrambled to put bills in the waistband of her g-string. When the music stopped she left the stage and minutes later appeared at my table. She leaned down and whispered to me, "Ready for your lap dance sugar?" 

"After seeing what you did to that pole I don't know that my heart can stand it." 

"I'll be gentle sugar." 

The music started again as the next dancer came on stage to do her set and Marta slid right onto my lap. Her almost naked pussy rubbed my pants covered cock as she pushed her 36 DD tits into my chest and then slowly stood up never pulling her tits away from my body. She slowly worked her way up until she was forced to pull away or let her tits touch my face which was a no no as far as the local law was concerned. 

Her tits were at eye level and her nipples were standing out like little cocks and if she had leaned forward she could have put an eye out. She whispered so that only I could hear: 

"They are real sugar. No plastic, no silicone, just one hundred percent Marta." 

She twisted from side to side and shook them in my face and then she moved back down my body until she was sitting on my lap again. She ground her pussy against the lump in my trousers and smiled as she felt the stiff cock trying to bust through my pants to get to her love box and that caused her to grind even harder. 

"Oh sugar, is that for little 'ole' me? Did this old hag cause a young stud like you to get like that?" 

She squirmed on my erection and bent forward and whispered, "I'll have to do something about that, won't I?" 

The music stopped and Marta got up, patted my cheek and said, "Don't go away sugar, there are more surprises on the way." 

My cock was throbbing as I watched her walk away and I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to roll around on a bed with that much woman and I also wondered about the "I'll have to do something" comment. Five minutes later the waitress came up to me and said, "If you will pick up your drink and follow me Marta would like to see you in her office." 

I got up to follow her and I noticed that she put the "reserved" sign back on the table. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Marta was sitting behind her desk when I came into the office. She was signing something and she looked up when I came in and smiled. 

"Be right with you sugar. Have a seat on the couch" and she pointed at a large leather couch against one wall. 

I sat there, sipped my drink, watched her and tried to guess her age. I finally settled on forty - a very well taken care of forty - and I caught myself wondering what an older woman would be like. She finished what she was doing, got up and came from behind the desk and as she did she allowed the robe she was wearing to fall to the floor and I saw that accept for high heels she was naked. I don't know how she interpreted the look on my face, but it was sheer admiration. 

"Surprised sugar? You shouldn't be. I did tell you that I would do something about your erection, like maybe make it go away? I like to take a young stud and make his erection disappear." 

She knelt in front of me and said, "Take it out sugar, let Marta have a good look at what she built." 

Was I thinking of Tessa when I took out my hard cock? No. I did have some strong feelings for Tessa, but our relationship was still a work in progress. I still hadn't forgotten the way our engagement had ended and I had put her behind me. The fact that were working at getting back together and seemed to be heading in the right direction did not mean that I was ready to make anything permanent or that I ever would. There was no way I was going to say no to a gorgeous and sexy woman like Marta until I said "I do" and had a ring on my finger. 

"Here sugar, let Marta do that" and she pushed my hand away from my dick. "Ooh, it's a nice one and I know just how he wants to be treated." 

Her hot mouth surrounded me and I leaned back and enjoyed what she was doing to me. After a minute or so she said, "Let me know when you are ready sugar. I swallow, but I don't like to be surprised," and she went back to sucking on me. It was a damned good blow job and I especially liked the way she looked into my eyes when she gave it to me. I was enjoying it so much that I would have liked for it to last a little longer, but my body was saying it had to let go. I told Marta and she took me as deep in her mouth as she could and when I came she gulped, sucked and swallowed it all. 

She was just taking her mouth off me when a buzzer went off. "That's me sugar, time for my next set. You can either go back to your table or get naked and wait for me to come back." 

"That's a choice? That's like saying here is a pound of gold and a pound of feathers. You can only have one so take your pick." 

"Do I take that to mean you will be here when I get back?" 

"You most certainly can." 

"There is a wet bar in the closet sugar. Help yourself until I get back." 

With three songs to a set and then a lap dance or three I figured that I had at least twenty minutes to kill so I wandered around Marta's office looking at the pictures and plaques hanging on the walls. There were photos of her with the current mayor and the two previous ones. There were pictures of her with the last three governors and at least a dozen of her with several sports celebrities. There were some civic awards and plaques that showed she belonged to Rotary International, Kiwanis and several other business organizations. 

I had been looking at a copy of a Monet that Marta had on the wall behind her desk and as I turned to go back to the couch something on her desk caught my eye. Marta had one of those large calendar pads on her desk and the name Tessa leaped up at me. I glanced at the calendar and written in the block for that day was: 

Tessa - Jefferson at the Hilton, Rm 347 extra for anal. 

Judy - Moser - Best Western rm 118 6pm. 

I looked at the previous two Fridays and saw: 

Tessa - Alderman, Marriott rm 512 at 7pm and 

Tessa - Bach party, Elks 9pm. 

The coming Friday was blank. It didn't take a Dick Tracy to figure out what Jefferson at the Hilton and extra for anal meant. Add to that Tessa's comment about "becoming a whore in only two years" and suddenly I was seeing Tessa in a different light. I walked over to the wet bar, made myself a fresh drink and went back to the couch to wait for Marta to finish her set. 

Marta walked into the office in high heels and a g-string with a sheen of sweat on her body. 

"I didn't waste time in putting anything on just so you could take it off again sugar. Excuse my French sugar, but I need to be fucked. Lap dances turn me on almost as much as they turn on the guy I'm giving it to. Can you help me out here sugar?" 

"How fast can you get that g-string off?" 

"If you are in a hurry sugar, just push it off to the side." 

"Take it off." 

When she had it off I pulled her down on the couch with me and I kissed her. It was a long hard kiss and her tongue was on its way into my mouth even as mine was on its way into hers. I ran a hand down her body until I reached her sex and I pushed a finger in. She moaned and pushed herself against my hand. She was hot and wet. I broke the kiss and said: 

"Do you cum when you get horny giving lap dances?" 

"Sometimes." 

"Is that why your pussy is so wet? Did you cum for this last guy?" 

"No sugar, that's from when I did you." 

"This wetness is mine?" 

"All yours sugar." 

"Then I want it" and I pushed her onto her back and I went down on her. She squirmed, moaned, cried out "Oh God yes" a couple of times and pushed her pussy up at my face. When my cock was throbbing so bad that I couldn't ignore it anymore I moved up and slid into her. 

I hoped that the room was sound proof because Marta was a noisy piece of ass. She hollered; she screamed and she cried out as I fucked her as hard as I could. She clutched, she grabbed and she dug her nails in and when I finally blew my nuts she wouldn't let me go. She held me tightly to her until her breathing became a little more regular and as she relaxed she said: 

"If Tessa gets this all the time sugar, she better keep you under lock and key. If she wasn't one of my girls I'd try and get you for me." 

"This probably isn't the best time to be asking this question since I seem to be rising to the occasion again, but how do you square your concern for 'your girls' with what we are doing right now?" 

"I just like to keep things even sugar. She gets a little on the side so you should too. Besides, I told you the night I met you that if you made her smile and you were nice to her I'd be nice to you. Then there is the reward factor. You are a unique man sugar. It isn't every man who would let his woman do what you let Tessa do and still love her and cherish her. That should get you something nice; I am nice, aren't I?" 

I suddenly had a hundred questions to ask, but before I could ask the first one Marta noticed my cock. 

"My goodness sugar, you sure do wonders for a girls ego" and she raised herself over me and using her left hand to guide me she sat down on my dick. The second romp was just as spirited as the first one and when it was over and the two of lay there trying to get our breath back I wondered how to lead the conversation to what I wanted to know. The desk pad and her "she gets a little on the side" comment gave me a pretty good idea of what was going on, but I didn't want just a good idea - I wanted to know. Marta's "unique man" comment made me think that Marta thought that I knew a whole lot more than I did. The more I thought about it the more I felt that the best way would be to go straight at it. 

"Marta, tell me about Tessa's Friday nights." 

"What's to tell sugar. I'm sure she covered it when she...., Oh shit! You don't know? She didn't tell you?" 

"Just that she does private parties like the bachelor party where we hooked. I heard her refuse money to engage in sexual acts. I take it that isn't always the case?" 

"You need to get it from her sugar. I've already said more than I should have." 

"Not now Marta, it is too late for that. What is going on?" 

"She was supposed to tell you. Once you two got back together I told her I wouldn't set her up with any more Friday work, but she said she still wanted them, that she still needed the kick she got from them. I told her I would only do it if she told you and you didn't object. The next Monday she told me that she had talked it over with you and you were okay with it." 

"All she told me was that she wanted to keep on doing what she had been doing and I thought that meant parties like the one where I saw her. What does she really do Marta?" 

"She does do bachelor parties sugar, any more than that you will have to get from her." 

"No Marta, it has to come from you. Right now my relationship with Tessa is still trying to find its feet. It is still in the fragile stage. She shafted me once and the memory of that and the thought that she could do it again is keeping me from committing to a deeper relationship. If I confront her, especially since you told her to tell me and she didn't, it could all come apart. If I get it from you I have the option of seeing whether or not I can accept it and if I can I don't need to confront her and we can let time work things out." 

"You have to make me a promise." 

"What?" 

"If you decide that you can't accept it you can't let her know what I've told you and you have to find some easy way to break up with her. Some way that has nothing to do with what she is doing." 

"Agreed." 

"Tessa is my star sugar. You see all the pictures on my wall? Congressmen, mayors, city councilmen, local sports figures? Tessa takes care of them for me." 

"Takes care of them how?" 

"Oh come on sugar, don't go all stupid on me here. You know damned well how. Our little Tessa pulls down an average of three grand on a Friday night. All cash, all tax-free. Your honey has a pretty hefty bank account down in an off shore bank in the islands, but she doesn't do it for the money sugar. Oh she will take the money, but she is doing it because she gets a kick out of doing it." 

"So you are what, her madam?" 

"In a sense sugar, but only in a very narrow sense. I don't take a dime of what Tessa and Judy make; I just act as the middleman - the fixer as it were. Say for instance Councilman Jones wants some quality companionship. He calls me, tells me what he wants and I fix him up with either Tessa or Judy. What I get out of it is the good will of Councilman Jones. I never have a problem with zoning, the Health Department, the Fire Marshall or any of the hundreds of other things that plague a business like mine." 

"So Tessa is a whore." 

"Yes and no." 

"What does that mean?" 

"I guess what it means is that on Friday night she is a whore, but not the rest of the time. She could be. She is a very popular lady and could stop dancing here and make three grand a night taking care of gentlemen callers, but she won't. She says she needs to do it every so often for the sexual high she gets, but she doesn't want to do it full time. She doesn't have to do it sugar. What she makes from her day job and what she pulls down here in tips have her pretty financially secure. She does what she does because she likes it. The same with dancing here; she doesn't need to, but she likes it." 

"She told me it was because she had become an exhibitionist." 

"Exactly sugar, exactly. So what now sugar?" 

"Long term I don't know Marta, but short term my cock is hard and I think you need to do something about it." 

"Oh sugar, you are such a silver tongued devil. You talked me into it. Come to momma sugar, come to momma." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

That was three months ago. My relationship with Tessa remains unchanged. Why shouldn't it? We aren't married and we have no responsibilities to each other. We still fuck like rabbits, have wild exhibitionistic Sundays and enjoy each other's company. Tessa doesn't know that I know what she does on Fridays just as she doesn't know that I spend my Fridays having a grand time with Marta. Will it ever change? Hard to say, but if and when it does the changes will be drastic. Both Tessa and Marta are hinting at marriage and I honestly have no idea of which way to jump - I want to keep them both. I'm not ready to give up the two greatest pieces of ass I have ever come across. Report_Story
