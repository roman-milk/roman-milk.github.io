It Was Only a Blowjob

 She didn't understand the big deal. He had to help her. 

 This could have gone into Loving Wives, but it's more than a simple tale of a mistake, and making things right. Elements could have gone into different categories, such as erotic couplings, fetish, romance, group sex, non-consent, incest, etc. So I've chosen Novels and Novellas as a catch all, rather than label each chapter differently. It's fairly long, seven chapters, and all but the last are complete and edited. 

 This is another one that's been on the 'finish' pile for a while, and has gone through a few iterations to get where it is today. I hope you enjoy it. 

 ======================== 

 It was a typical Christmas party, really. Most of the same crowd, about a third from the neighborhood, plus friends and co-workers of Tom and Misty. They always put on a nice spread. 

 We'd moved into the area within the last year, but my wife Wendy and Misty had been friends for a long while. They had worked together at Wendy's first job, until I stole her away to make her mine. This was the fifth holiday party of theirs we'd attended, every year since our wedding. 

 I was afraid that Wendy might tie one on. She'd had Jeannie, our first, a little less than 4 months earlier, and this was only the second big party we'd attended since then. The last one had been the Thomas' Halloween Party, but she'd been recovering at that point, exhausted and still carrying an extra 15 pounds. She'd been laying off the alcohol, as well, barely 5 weeks after giving birth, still nervous about the effect of booze while breastfeeding. 

 Mid-November we'd hosted a party of our own, but the barbecue had only included four other couples, and since it was at our house, among close friends, I hadn't worried about Wendy getting a little toasted for the first time in almost a year. She'd earned it. Plus, a tipsy Wendy always meant great loving later. 

 Tom had a big house. Hell, there wasn't a small one in the gated community we shared. The party was scattered throughout the place, kitchen, family room, living room, media room, dining room, foyer, porch, garage, backyard. I know because I'd just finished the tour looking for my wife. She'd been feeling no pain an hour ago, although it seemed she hadn't been drinking much. The doctor had assured her that having a few drinks while nursing didn't harm the baby, as long as she wasn't drunk while doing it. After he gave her a chart showing her how long it took the alcohol to leave her body, she was happy. She'd been pumping and storing her milk for a few weeks, so she'd have a clear conscience, and wouldn't have to nurse Jeannie for several feedings after the party. 

 I knew she wasn't planning on holding back, and I wanted to keep an eye on her. She could be a sloppy drunk, and I wanted to find her before she got too obnoxious or boisterous. The alcohol was flowing, the mistletoe was popular, and the flirting was getting a little out of hand. 

 On the second pass, I found her sitting in a corner, alone, smiling, watching the activities. It was something we liked to do, as the night went on. Find a nice observation point and watch everyone make fools of themselves. The concerns I'd harbored vanished. 

 She was sitting in a lounge chair, and I perched on the arm of it, leaning down and putting my arm around her. "Having fun?" 

 "The best. I had to stop drinking, it was hitting me hard." 

 I leaned closer to whisper to her, and stopped, stunned. Her breath stank. Of cum. 

 She was watching me, and I saw her get nervous. 

 "What the fuck, Wendy?" I snapped. 

 Her look was confused. "What?" 

 I pressed my face almost to hers. She grinned and pursed her lips for a kiss. 

 I breathed deep. Shit. No doubt. "Who's cock have you been sucking?" I whispered harshly. 

 "W...What?" she responded hesitantly. Her face, an open book to me, displayed her guilt. 

 I stood and grabbed her by the wrist, dragging her behind me toward the entrance. I heard laughing, and looked back to see whose ass I'd have to kick later. Four guys stood together, and Tom was grinning like the cat who'd got the cream. Or delivered it, in this case. Son-of-a-bitch. 

 "Stop, John," she whined, resisting. "You're hurting me!" 

 I ignored her, pushed her through the door, and slammed it behind me. 

 She stopped, standing with her arms crossed. Determined. "I'm not going anywhere with you like this." 

 "Fine. Stay. I'll fill out the divorce papers tomorrow," I told her as I stomped off. 

 I heard the clack of her heels chasing after me. "What are you talking about? What divorce?" 

 "You want to stay here and keep sucking their cocks, you're welcome. You know how I feel about cheating. Don't return to my house." 

 She ran up to me and grabbed my arm. "Stop, John! You're scaring me!" 

 "You should have thought about that before you got on your knees and took some asshole's prick in your mouth!" 

 "Tom's not an asshole. He's one of your best friends," she whined. 

 Fuck. Just like that. "No he's not. He's the back-stabbing fucker you cheated on me with, and the next time I see him I'm going to beat the living shit out of him." 

 She was tugging on my arm as I kept walking. I was angry and twice her size, I barely noticed the drag. "John, I never cheated on you. You know I would never do that." 

 "How long did you hold his cum in your mouth, you stupid slut?" 

 She let go of me, staring as I walked around the car. 

 Wendy had always been a cum slut. She loved it. The feel, the smell, the texture. I didn't have a problem with that because she was my cum slut. She loved to have me come on her, playing with my juices, dipping her finger into it, drawing little designs, sucking her finger saucily. She'd sucked me off hundreds, maybe thousands of times. She loved to sit back with a silly smile on her face, holding it in her mouth, playing with it for an eternity. She never rinsed her mouth afterward. 

 I'd received more than one call at work, telling me she could still taste me, hours after she'd delivered a morning blow job. Those calls made my day. More than once I'd gone home for lunch to give her another taste. 

 I loved that look on her face, the satisfied, naughty smile, when my cum was fresh in her mouth. Except when I'd seen it tonight, not even recognizing it at first, until I smelled the evidence on her breath. 

 I unlocked the door and got in the car. 

 "I don't have my purse or my coat," she said. 

 "Go back and get it. I don't care. Get in the car, or go back. Your choice." 

 She opened the door and dropped into the seat heavily, slamming the door behind her. "Why are you being such an asshole? It was only a blowjob." 

 "Only a blowjob!" I screamed at her. "Are you really that ignorant! Get out. Just get out." I pushed her harshly. 

 She struggled, hanging onto the door handle. "I didn't fuck him. I never would. I wouldn't cheat on you. I couldn't." 

 "Go suck all of them. I really don't care. Be their slut, you cheating bitch." 

 She was crying softly. "Why do you keep saying you don't care, when you're so angry?" 

 "I don't care what you do anymore. You destroyed any marriage we had when you threw your wedding vows away." I told her, driving the half-dozen blocks to our home. 

 "IT WAS ONLY A BLOWJOB!" she shrieked. "You know I sucked dozens of cocks before we were married. That's all it was. A little quickie suck. Kind of a Christmas treat. I didn't cheat. I didn't let them touch me. I never fucked anyone." 

 "Before we were married," I reminded her. "Nameless nobodies I didn't know about before we were committed to each other. Before your vows to stay faithful to me. Now you're just another cheating slut." 

 "I didn't cheat! I keep telling you that. Why won't you believe me? I never lie to you. You know that. I'm not lying now." 

 "How many?" I asked. 

 "How many what?" she replied nervously. 

 "You said them. How many cocks did you suck?" 

 "Tonight?" 

 "GOD DAMN IT!" I screamed at her, beating my hand against the steering wheel, as I pulled into the driveway. "How many tonight?" I asked, trying to calm down. 

 "Two," she said softly. 

 "Tom and...?" 

 "I'm not going to tell you. You're just going to get mad over something stupid. You're not going to beat up Tom either. He didn't do anything wrong." 

 "Then you can stay out here, or go back to the party. You're not coming in my house, slut." 

 "It's my house too!" 

 "Not since you destroyed our marriage, bitch. You can talk to your lawyer. I'll have a restraining order in the morning." Not likely, I know, but it sounded good. 

 I got out of the car and slammed the door behind me, unlocking the back entrance. Once again, the noisy clack of her 4 inch fuck-me heels chased after me. The sound irritated me to no end. "Please, John. This is stupid." 

 I opened the door, and pressed my hand against her chest, preventing her from following. "Oh. I'm stupid now? For wanting my WIFE to be FAITHFUL!" 

 "Jarrod. The other one was Jarrod, Ok?" she snapped. 

 "Ok? Did you say Ok? It's supposed to be Ok that you sucked two strange cocks tonight?" 

 "They're not strange. They're our friends," she argued, standing on the step. 

 "Friends? You humiliated me! My wife's a cheating slut, with our friends, at the biggest party of the year, and everyone's laughing at me behind my back, hell, to my face. I can never stand to see any of them again. You've destroyed us. Our marriage. Our life. How could you?" 

 She put her hand on my arm and I shook her off. "They're not laughing at you. They would never do that. They think you're the luckiest guy in the world. They might get a couple of quick sucks, but you get it every day, all you want. I'm yours, not theirs." 

 "Every day!" I snapped angrily. "When was the last time you sucked me off." 

 "Yesterday," she answered quickly. 

 "To finish? You held my cum in your mouth like you did theirs?" 

 "No, you wanted to fuck." 

 "Of course I wanted to fuck! I've been doing without for over five months. Of course I want to fuck!" I reminded her. "When was the last time you sucked me off?" I asked again. 

 "Last week," she said hesitantly. 

 "Really? I don't remember that. When was it?" 

 She seemed to be thinking about it. "I...I don't remember." 

 "Three weeks ago, last Wednesday." 

 "No! I know we did it since then," she argued. 

 "Three and a half weeks. You haven't sucked me off since we started having sex again." 

 She approached closer, reaching for me, and I brushed her hand away again. "I thought all you wanted was my pussy. You seemed so happy." 

 "I was happy, until I found my wife was sucking off everyone we know, while making me do without. You are such a bitch." 

 She shook her head. "I...I never denied you. You know I love to suck your cock. It's the best. I swear, I love it. I love you." 

 "You did deny me. Multiple times. Shall I list the times for you? You were too busy thinking about your new boyfriends, I'm sure." 

 The tears were running again. Big fake tears. "They're not my boyfriends, and I've never denied you anything. Our love life is the best. Everyone knows that." 

 I pulled the scotch out of the cabinet, and poured myself a big stiff one. "Right. And just how would everyone know that?" 

 She blushed. "You know we women talk about stuff. Everyone's jealous. Girls and guys." 

 "Great. They know I'm a cuckold, and they know everything about our love life. They know I can't satisfy my wife, and she has to get cock from assholes like Tom and Jarrod. Jarrod? Really? Jesus, Wendy, any other little tidbits you'd like to dump on me? Something else you can do to destroy everything we ever had?" 

 She stomped out of the room. "Fuck you, John! Why are you making such a big God-damned deal out of a lousy blowjob!" 

 I watched her disappear into the bedroom, closing the door behind her. 

 No way. No fucking way. 

 I followed her and tried to open the door. It was locked. "You BITCH!" I snarled, and kicked the door hard, splintering the frame. 

 She was sitting on the bed, eyes wide in fright, staring at me. "You don't fucking lock me out of my room. This is my bedroom. Get your cheating ass out of here and find somewhere else to sleep." I don't think I'd ever been angrier in my life. 

 "You're drunk, you jerk. You're going to feel sorry about this tomorrow, and I'm not going to forgive you no matter how much you beg." She had her shoes in her hand and did a piss-poor job of throwing them at me. I didn't even have to dodge. 

 Wendy ran out of the room crying, and I slammed the door behind her. I fell back on the bed, feeling the tears come. How could she do this? Why? What had happened to us? 

 * * * 

 I slept restlessly, images of her sucking cock after cock, men lined up waiting their turn, their stinking juices covering her naked torso. I couldn't turn off the pictures in my brain. I suspected I'd never be able to. 

 I finally got out of the bed, tired and miserable. A quick shower didn't help. I walked out of the room and headed to the kitchen. My former loving wife was sitting there, watching me coldly. 

 I poured myself a cup of coffee, taking a sip. I grabbed a piece of plain white bread and ate it, hoping it would settle my stomach. I avoided looking at the slut. 

 "Are you calm enough to explain yourself yet?" she asked. 

 "Yes. I've thought about it. I'll have the papers drafted Monday. I'll pay child support for whoever's child it is. There'll be no alimony, we've only been married four years. We'll split everything 50/50..." 

 "What are you talking about! We're not splitting anything!" 

 "We'll sell the house. Hopefully we won't lose too much on it. There's not much in the bank..." 

 "Whoever's child it is! She's your baby, John. You know that." 

 "I know nothing. Nothing about you. I would never have believed you were a lying cheater, but there you go. Learn something new every day." 

 "I DIDN'T CHEAT! STOP SAYING THAT!" 

 "Did you, or did you not suck Tom's cock?" I asked. 

 "I told you I did, but that was all!" 

 "Did you, or did you not suck Jarrod's cock?" 

 "Why do you keep asking? I told you I did, but nothing else. He never touched me." 

 "Who else? How many others?" I asked, sipping my coffee, trying to act strong, facing her betrayal. 

 "Why? Why do you want to know? Does it really matter? I swear I didn't cheat on you with any of them." 

 "I need to know who I can never face again. Whose asses I'm going to kick. Whose lives I'm going to destroy, just like they've destroyed mine." 

 "Please stop this, John. You're frightening me. Calm down. Nothing's happened. We'll be fine, better than fine. Just calm down." 

 "Who, Wendy? Who else's cock have you sucked, cum you savored and swallowed like a common street walker?" 

 "Aaron, alright? Just Aaron. Tom three times, Aaron once, and Jarrod once. That's all. Five stupid blowjobs, and you're getting this worked up over it. Shit. I wish I'd never done it." 

 "I wish you'd never done it too," I said. "We can get lawyers if you want, or we can do a simple uncontested no-fault divorce like the Pennington's. I won't go for infidelity. I'll want joint custody, if the DNA shows that Jeannie's mine." 

 "I don't want a divorce!" 

 "I didn't either," I told her. "We really can't afford to drag this out, your daughter will be the one to suffer. Let's just make this simple Ok? I don't want to fight about this anymore. Obviously we have a problem I didn't know about. I'm sorry about whatever it is I did that drove you to this. I would have prevented it if I could. I loved you, you know." 

 "Oh, God, John. Stop talking like this. We're not getting divorced. Jeannie's yours and you know it. I've never cheated on you. I wouldn't. I love you, and I know you love me. So stop this nonsense." 

 "How can you say you didn't cheat on me? You had sex with other men. Multiple men. Multiple times. You'd probably have added a few more last night if I didn't catch you. Stop the lying. Just admit it, and let us move on. I'm not going to use it as the cause of our divorce." 

 "I didn't have sex with them. I gave them a lousy blowjob. Less than five fucking minutes with any of them. Jesus, how many times do I have to explain it to you, you idiot!" 

 Could she be that dense? Really? 

 I walked over and took her by the hand. She leaped out of the chair, her ratty old robe opening, showing me her exquisite body. Which I'd never get to enjoy again. I peeled her arms away from me, grabbed the phone, and walked with her into the living room. "Sit." 

 She sat down, still clinging to my hand. 

 I called my mother, and pressed the speaker-phone button. A few rings later someone picked up. "John? Have fun last night?" 

 "Hey Mom. Is there any chance that you can watch Jeannie a little longer? Wendy and I have some things we have to get done." 

 "What's wrong? What's going on? Is there some problem?" 

 Never could pull one over on Mom. "No. Just some stuff we have to work out. Can you watch her 'til this evening? I'll give you a call before we come for her." 

 "Of course. You know I love my grand-daughter. Every moment with her is precious. Are you sure everything's Ok?" 

 "Not now Mom. I'll talk to you later." 

 Wendy was watching me as I hung up and dialed the next number. It rang several times before it picked up. "Hello?" 

 "Hey Misty. John here. Sorry we had to leave early. Hell of a party." 

 "What happened? Tom said you marched out of here around midnight without saying a word to anyone. You were practically dragging Wendy with you. Is everything alright?" 

 "Wendy's here with me now. You're on speaker-phone." 

 "Why? What's going on?" 

 "I have a pretty simple question for you. What would you consider cheating in a marriage?" 

 "John!" Wendy exclaimed. 

 "Oh my God! You didn't cheat on her did you! Please tell me you didn't," Misty sounded angry. 

 "No I didn't cheat. I'm trying to make sure we understand each other. Where does flirting and kidding around stop, and cheating begin." 

 Misty was quiet. "What did she do?" 

 "Please. Can you help us here? You're her best friend. When is it cheating?" 

 "God, I don't know. Anything sexual of course. I guess it could be cheating even before you do it, emotionally. When you decide you're going to." 

 "By sexual, what do you mean? Please be specific." 

 "John, this is embarrassing. Wouldn't you prefer to talk to Tom?" 

 "No, I would definitely not prefer to talk to him," I answered her heatedly. 

 "Oh no," she moaned. "Please tell me that they didn't..." 

 "Cheating. When is it cheating?" 

 "I...I guess anything involving breasts, penis and vagina," she said. 

 "Through clothing? How about the ass?" 

 "I don't think some light touching is really cheating. A lot of that happens you know. It's not that serious. Rubbing someone's butt during a dance, or a friendly boob squeeze isn't that bad. Not between friends. That's all it was, right?" 

 "What about screwing? Anal sex, oral sex? Any of that cheating?" 

 "What kind of crazy question is that? Anything involving touching a naked ass, tit, pussy or cock is obviously cheating. Do you mean like through their underwear? That might not have to be cheating, as long as nobody comes." 

 "If it was naked skin, and someone did come, that would be cheating?" I asked. 

 "What the hell is going on, John? Of course coming, no matter how it happens would be cheating." 

 "Thank you, Misty. I'm sorry we bothered you, and made a bit of a scene last night." 

 "Please, John. What happened? You can't leave me hanging like this! What's this about? Wendy?" 

 "Later, I promise. Thanks for your help." I hung up on her, and looked over at my cheating wife. 

 Wendy didn't look the least remorseful. "That's stupid. Of course she'd say that. Their sex life is shit. She's never blown Tom. What does she know?"  

 

 

===

I called six more of her friends, with equal responses from all, except for a few caveats such as it's not cheating if both spouses agree to it, or if they're separated, or if it's forced. 

 "They're wrong," she continued to argue. "If you can't get a baby from it, it's not cheating." 

 "So if you let someone fuck you in the ass, that's not cheating?" 

 She blushed. "I didn't say that." 

 "That's exactly what you said. You can't get a baby from it. Hell, according to your definition, if you use a rubber or you're on the pill it's not cheating." 

 She was getting angrier. "You know that's not what I meant!" 

 "No, I have no idea what you mean. What do you think cheating is?" I asked. 

 "Sex. A penis and vagina. Penetration. That's cheating." 

 "Not anal sex?" 

 She sighed. "I guess I'd consider that cheating. That's wrong." 

 "But oral sex isn't?" 

 "Of course not. It's not love. Look, my breasts, my pussy, my ass, they're private. I keep them covered. Nobody sees them but you and my doctor. They're sex organs, I mean the butt isn't really, but it can be used that way. I keep my sex for you, only you. Nobody's allowed close. The mouth isn't. It's there for everyone to see. Eating, talking, breathing..." 

 "Kissing?" 

 "Exactly! Kissing isn't cheating. We kiss people all the time. We kiss our parents and our baby. The mouth isn't like the rest." 

 "How about a man's cock? Isn't that a sex organ?" 

 She nodded. "Obviously. But unless they come together it's not cheating. Some guy tries to stick his prick in me, he's dead meat." 

 "So if I were to go over to Misty's right now, take her clothing off and go down on her, that wouldn't be cheating." 

 "Of course it would! That's her naked pussy, I'd never let anyone but you touch mine. Why would you want to do that anyway, when you've got me? I'll do anything you want." 

 "Damn you're screwed up. Oral sex with a woman is cheating, with a man it's not?" 

 "It's not the same. You know it." She sighed. "This should be easy to understand. If I don't think it's cheating, it's not, and you shouldn't think it is either." 

 Unbelievable. 

 I grabbed the phone again, dialing, waiting for the answer. 

 "Wendy?" 

 "Mom?" Wendy answered, looking at me in fear. 

 "Hi Carol, John here." 

 "What's going on? Why are you both on the phone? There's nothing wrong with Jeannie is there?" I could hear the fear in her voice. I was only hoping I could get the right words out of her. The damn woman was a chatterbox. Not all that fond of me, either. I was taking a big chance. 

 "No, Jeannie's fine. Wendy and I have a simple question I hope you can help us with." 

 "Whatever I can do, you know that." 

 "What's cheating in a marriage?" 

 "Why? What's going on? You didn't cheat on her did you, you bastard!" she shrieked. 

 "I haven't done anything, Carol. I promise. We're having a problem coming to terms. Please, when is it considered cheating?" 

 She was slow to answer. "Times have changed, John. Things aren't the way they were when I was growing up. Flirting and teasing is so much more common. When I was young, half the stuff you do would be considered cheating. We didn't have emails and texts. All that online flirting. It's different now." 

 "So sex is Ok?" I asked. 

 "What! What have you done?" 

 "Nothing. I repeat. I have done nothing. I've never cheated, or anything close to it. I only want to make sure we're on the same page." 

 "Sex is not Ok! Don't even pretend you think it is!" Wendy's mother snapped. "Wendy! You're not going to let him get away with this. You have to draw the line. If you don't, he'll run all over you." 

 "Mom," Wendy sighed. "It was just a blowjob. No big deal, right?" 

 "John, you son of a bitch! Wait until Ed hears about this! You get your ass out of that house you lousy cheating bastard! I don't want you ever touching our daughter again, do you hear me? Just a blowjob! Like anyone is going to put up with that shit! I always knew you'd do something like this. Fancy job, all those pretty girls around you all the time. Was it your big tit secretary? Was that who it was Wendy?" 

 I saw the tears in her eyes, "There was no cheating, Mom. He would never do that to me. We just had to make sure we agreed where to draw the line." 

 "Don't lie to me, and don't cover for that son-of-a-bitch! You don't deserve this, and don't let him tell you otherwise. I bet he told you it was the pregnancy, didn't he? You get fat and tired, and all they do is think with their little heads." She was getting louder. "Damn you, John! Was it the baby? Is that your excuse? We can't help it if we can't have sex afterward. You have no idea how hard that is on a woman. We have to heal, and I know it doesn't feel right for a long time after, but that's part of being a family and parents. That's a lousy fucking excuse, for sticking your tiny little prick in some slut's mouth!" 

 I couldn't help but grin. Man, she was worked up. She never cursed. Never. Lord, I was on her shit-list. 

 "Carol. I've done nothing. I swear. It's something we have to work out on our own." 

 "Wendy?" 

 "He's right Mom. He didn't do anything." 

 The silence hung heavy. "Oh no!" I heard her gasp. "You didn't! Tell me you didn't, baby! It had to be an accident. John, you know she loves you. She would never cheat on you. It must be a misunderstanding. Please, think of the baby. You have to forgive her." 

 "She'll call you later, Ok? Sorry to bother you, Carol." 

 "No John, don't hang up. Don't, please! She loves you. We all love you. You're the best thing that ever happened to her. You do love him, don't you, baby?" 

 Wendy had tears running down her face. "Yes Mom. I love him. I always have. I love him with all my heart." 

 "See John? See? She loves you. Don't do anything stupid. Nothing you'll regret, Ok? We can work through this. It's all a mistake. One big stupid mistake. I know it is." 

 I interrupted her. "Carol, stop. She'll call you later. Thanks for helping." I hung up before I'd have to listen to any more of her chattering. If I cheated I was a lousy rotten bastard son-of-a-bitch. Her precious daughter was misunderstood. Of course. How could I miss it? 

 I thought that would be the end of it. Wendy grabbed the phone out of my hand, and started pressing numbers angrily. A few seconds later the other end picked up. 

 "Hey girl, how'd the party go? Have a good time?" 

 Wendy glared at me. "Blowjobs aren't cheating, are they?" 

 "Of course not. Everyone knows that, sis." 

 "Hey Alice, John here. You want to put your husband on the phone? I'm sure he'd love to hear your opinion on blowjobs." I asked my sister-in-law. 

 The phone went dead. 

 Wendy looked at me confused. "It must have been an accident," she said, grabbing the phone and hitting redial. The phone rang a couple of times, then picked up and went back to a dial-tone. 

 "Why would she do that?" Wendy whined, finally looking nervous. She dialed again and the phone was busy. "It shouldn't be busy, they have call waiting." She hung up again, and it went back to busy. 

 She settled back into the couch, looking fearful. "It doesn't matter anyway. You heard her. Blowjobs don't count." 

 "You think Dave has the same opinion?" 

 She seemed to ponder it. "Listen, honey. It shouldn't matter. This was all a misunderstanding. I didn't think it was cheating, but I guess you did. I'm sorry. It won't happen again." 

 "Wendy, let me ask you a simple question. Would you have given him a blowjob in front of me? In front of Misty, his wife?" 

 Part of her problem, I honestly believe, is she didn't think things out. She didn't think about what she was doing, and she didn't think before she spoke. 

 "Of course not! That would be so embarrassing," she answered quickly. 

 "I want you to think about something. Don't speak yet. Just take a moment to ponder. You should never do something with another man that you wouldn't do in front of me. Think about that. If you wouldn't do it in front of me, it's a type of cheating." 

 For once, she did as I asked. She was quiet, focused on what I'd said. I didn't press her, letting her work it out for herself. 

 She finally nodded. "Ok, I get it. I didn't think you'd like that, but if you want, next time I could blow him in front of you. It's not that big a deal. It might even be better, he won't bug me so much about doing more. If you want to see it, I guess that would be fine." 

 Jesus-Fucking-Christ. Next time? 

 I got up and walked out before I did something rash, hearing her call out from behind me. "John! Don't walk away. We need to get past this. I want to make things right," she yelled, before the closing door silenced her. 

 I went to work trying to get my mind off my problems. I was running through scenarios to get a little payback from the assholes who were using my wife. I had to be careful, we had a lot of government contracts, and I had to carry a security clearance which I didn't want to jeopardize. Jail would not be good. 

 A few hours with my head buried in my work, and I wasn't feeling a whole lot better. We were at such loggerheads. Nothing I said seemed to get through to her that her behavior was unacceptable. 

 Did I believe she thought it was no big deal? Sadly, yes. She was doing bad things, horrible things for our marriage, but it wasn't that she was trying to hurt me, or even was careless about her family. I honestly was beginning to believe she didn't understand the ramifications of her actions, and was very possibly misled by her lousy sister. 

 Our love life had been exceptional. She was loving, attentive, and generous with her affection. Ever since we were married, she was very physically demonstrative, and a tiger in the bed. She loved oral sex, giving much more than receiving. It was true that for most of our marriage she'd blow me as much as I wanted, maybe even more. It was no exaggeration that I could get blown every day, twice a day if I desired. 

 Until the pregnancy. 

 The first 7 months hadn't changed things much, but she had issues late, and was under bed-rest much of the time. I took care of her the best I could, with a lot of help from her mother and sister. 

 It struck me that her sister Alice had spent a lot of time with her, before and after the pregnancy. I had never had a problem with Alice. She was friendly, attractive, and seemed to have a good solid marriage. She liked to flirt a little, but nothing over the top. We didn't socialize a lot, but I never had an issue with her. Until now. That call had really knocked me for a loop. 

 After the pregnancy, nothing had happened for a couple of weeks, then for the next month, she seemed determined to suck my damn cock off. After 6 weeks the doctor gave her the OK to start having sex again, but it was still another week of multiple daily blowjobs, before I ended up back between her legs. 

 I'd been doing without sex for a few months, and for the next several weeks her oral efforts ended up with me plowing her hot little pussy gratefully. I'll confess, she didn't feel the same after giving birth, she'd been a tight fuck until the baby, but I wasn't complaining. I loved it, and I loved her. 

 I often was able to give her a double dose, but the one thing she didn't really like to do was suck me after I'd been inside her. If that was her only issue, I wasn't going to make an issue of it. 

 It wasn't until the blowup, that I realized how drastically the oral sex had fallen off. I could take part of the blame, as soon as she got me hard, I wanted to spread her sexy legs and pound one into her. I realized she may have been tapering off because she didn't enjoy the sex as much as she did the oral. Like I said, every blowjob ended up with my blowing a load inside of her, and I had forgotten how much she loved cum, playing with it, tasting it. I wasn't giving her what she needed, but she'd never said anything. 

 In a way, I'd let her down. I only wished we'd communicated. 

 I didn't want to go home. I didn't want to face her, and her thick-headed arguments. I couldn't stand to see that cheating mouth that had at least 5 loads dropped in it that weren't mine. I hadn't given her a taste in almost a month. From twice a day to nothing. 

 Tom, Jarrod, Aaron. Motherfuckers. She might have been stupid, naive and confused, but those assholes knew better. All of them married. Sticking their cocks in my wife's mouth. They had to pay. 

 I went out to eat, and while waiting for my dinner, I turned on my cell phone and checked my messages. My voice-mail box was full. I started listening to them, and got mad again, 3-3-7, forward to the end and delete. Six from Wendy, none of which I managed to listen to through the end. Two from her mother. Two more from Misty, Tom's wife. One from my mother. Jesus, what a mess. 

 I'd been throwing around the word divorce a lot. I was furious with her, but I couldn't deny I loved her more than I had imagined possible. I wanted things back the way they were, and resolved that even if I didn't divorce her, I'd still have to divorce myself from the crowd we'd been around. No way I could hold my head up around those fucking bastards. No way. 

 While eating my meal, I texted my wife. I wasn't ready to speak to her, but I didn't want this thing completely blowing up, either. Not yet. If it did, I was going to control it. 

 I let her know that I'd gone into work, to distract myself from what she'd done to our marriage. I was eating out. 

 Five minutes later, while drinking my after dinner coffee, I got a response. Please hurry home. I love you. I'm sorry. Short and to the point. 

 It wasn't like an affair. I didn't believe she'd fallen out of love with me, or intentionally disrespected me. But she was so damned stupid. Blowjobs didn't matter? No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't see my way around that. Or how she stuck to it, against all odds and other viewpoints. I thought about that a while. Perhaps she did understand, but was clinging to her argument so she wouldn't have to take responsibility for her slutty actions. 

 I love D.C. at night. The later the better. When the traffic was gone, and the monuments and buildings were lit up. A drive around the reflecting pool, seeing the monuments, up and down the mall with all the museums, the Capitol, the Washington Monument. 

 I stopped for a couple of beers, still avoiding the scene at home. What was I going to do? How could we get past this? Did I want to make an effort, or would it be easier to cut bait and take my loss? Could I ever look at her the same? 

 My three month old perfect daughter, Jeannie. Holding her for the first time, with my tired smiling wife in that little room, surrounded by the doctor, nurses, her mother and sister. Little tiny fingers. Ten of them. Each a miniature masterpiece. Pressing mine into her palm hoping she'd clutch it. Angry red face, wispy dark hair. My child. Our child. God, how I loved to hold her! Settled into the crook of my arm, late at night, singing to her with my lousy voice, smelling her, feeling the negligent weight slowly tiring my arm, until I'd switch to the other. The instant feeling of loss when I passed her to anyone else. Mine. A little bit of me. I couldn't lose that. 

 I had to somehow work things out with Wendy. Let her see how I felt. Get past the denial and back to the way things should be. I hoped we wouldn't have to move, but if that's what it took, so be it. 

 A few people tried to strike up conversations, but I was having none of it. I perched on my stool, and worked my way through a pair of large Guinnesses, feeling sorry for myself, and desperately trying to avoid thoughts of what my wife had done. 

 My incoming-text ring went off. I'd had a few normal call rings, but had silenced each one. This one was from Wendy again. Are you coming home? I miss you. I'm sorry. 

 I believed she was sorry. Not just for getting caught, but for doing anything to hurt us. I still was certain she believed I was the unreasonable one. Bitch. 

 I texted her back. Soon. I love you too. Kiss Jeannie for me 

 Her response was immediate. She's staying at Mom's. Thank you 

 I paid my bill, and got in my car, taking a moment to make sure that the beer with dinner and two more in the bar hadn't left me too impaired to drive. I felt a bit of a buzz, but I'd taken a few hours to drink what I had, and didn't think I was over the line. 

 I took a nostalgic drive up 14th street, seeing the urbanization. When I was a kid, 14th and K was the seediest place around. Dirty movie parlors and packs of prostitutes on every corner. For a teenager it was eye opening. The women would wave, and often flash you, running over to the car at a stoplight and sticking their head in the window if it was open. 

 I remember one nasty looking woman sticking her head in my window and instantly reaching between my legs. Her skirt was so short you could see her underwear. My buddy Ralph was laughing as we pulled away. He was in the backseat and claimed he'd reached out through his window and stuck his finger up inside her, while she was trying to convince me to let her give me a blowjob. 

 It wasn't the same anymore. Urban renewal. I drove past the park at K street, and turned right on L, the next street up, headed east toward 7th St, Georgia Ave, and back home. 

 As I neared 11th and L, I started seeing the same sights I remembered from back in the day. The girls were still around, they'd just relocated. I thought it was a little ironic they'd set up shop right next to the Department of Justice building. 

 At the stop light I heard a tapping on my window. I looked over and saw a haggard young girl looking in hopefully. To this day I can't tell you why I rolled down my window. 

 "Looking for a good time?" she asked hesitantly, leaning over and showing me her dangling smallish breasts, holding her shirt open. 

 "Aren't you young for this?" I asked, without thinking. 

 She blushed. Really. I kid you not. A blushing hooker. "I'm legal, if that's your problem. I promise you, it'll be good." She looked up and down the street. "You're not a cop, are you?" 

 I laughed. "No. I'm not a cop. You're not, are you?" Already, the seeds of an idea were taking root. 

 She shook her head. "Can I get in?" 

 That seemed strange. Then again, what did I know about hookers? "Isn't that dangerous?" 

 "I can't afford to get busted, and I really need the money," she said. I could swear I saw tears in her eyes. Hell of a sales technique. It was cold out, and she was barely dressed. I could see the goosebumps on her arm, and she was trembling. She looked miserable. I didn't find her attractive, I had far better at home. She didn't turn me on. She broke my heart. What drove a kid to this? 

 I hit the unlock button, and I watched her long skinny leg slide into the car, 4 inch clear plastic heel first, with at least a two-inch platform. She slid her red vinyl-skirted butt into the car and closed the door, then rolled up the window. 

 "In the car? Or do you have some place to go?" she asked. 

 "Don't you have someplace nearby you take your Johns?" 

 She shook her head. "I'm working solo, and trying to keep it that way. I don't need some stupid bastard taking my money, and telling me what I have to do." 

 "Been doing this long?" I asked, starting to wonder what I was doing. 

 She smiled. "You're a talker, aren't you? Can I get at least $20, even if we don't do anything? Time is money, you know." 

 I pulled onto Mass. Ave, across Mt. Vernon place. "I won't send you home broke. I promise." 

 "This isn't solicitation," she said nervously. "I haven't offered sex for money." 

 "Relax, I'm not a cop. How old are you?" Damn if she didn't look like she was 16. 

 I turned onto 7th St., headed North, and was surprised when she pushed a driver's license in front of my face. "I'm 18. Since October. Satisfied?" She sounded angry, tucking her license away, before I even got a chance to look at it. "I thought you old guys liked the young girls anyway. I can be 13 for you."  

 

 

===

Old guy? I wasn't even 30 yet. "How much for a blowjob?" I asked, once more surprising myself. 

 "$20 for a quickie. You want the really good, extended action, toe curler, take me someplace and I'll blow your mind for $50." 

 I almost laughed, which would have been cruel. "I doubt you'll blow my mind. My wife gives the best blowjobs in the Northern Hemisphere." 

 "Then why are you asking?" She reached toward the center console and turned the heat up, giving me a quick questioning look, as if to see if it was OK. I directed the central vent toward her. 

 She didn't seem to mind that we were driving further north, into the suburbs, away from the bustle of downtown. 

 "My darling wife suddenly thinks that blowjobs aren't sex, and it's Ok if she gives them to people other than her husband." 

 My young companion grinned. "Then this is your lucky day. I'm going to give you the best 'not-sex' you've ever had. You want to make a night of it, I'll give you so much 'not-sex' you'll be begging for a break. All for the one-time bargain price of $200." 

 Fuck. I liked her. She was funny and confident. Kind of cute if you got past her dirty, skanky look. "I thought you said $50? This is kind of scary, you went from $20 to $50 and now $200." 

 She pouted. "An escort would cost you ten times as much, and wouldn't be half as good. I can promise you that." 

 The money was no big deal. Hell, Wendy spent $200 every other week at the hairdresser. She wasn't cheap to keep, although I'd never had a problem with it. We could afford it, and she was worth every penny. Emphasis on the was. 

 My street pickup was still watching me, and I heard her stomach rumble. She seemed embarrassed. "Hungry?" I asked. 

 "I'll be fine. Do we have a deal? I'll do the whole night thing for $150. How about that?" She reached her hand over and put it on my thigh, rubbing me. I guess she was trying to be sexy, but it seemed forced. 

 I put my hand over hers, giving it a little squeeze. "Never lower your price, sweetie. You were doing everything right. I kind of believe that the $200 would be well spent, if not the best ever." 

 "You want to make a bet on that? I'll do it for $100. If it's the best you ever had, you pay me what you think it's worth. If it's not, I get a C-note, you take me back, and you've received the bargain of a lifetime." 

 The idea that had been bubbling away below the surface burst, and I smiled. I pulled out my wallet, and counted out a hundred dollar bill and five twenties. I passed them to her. 

 "You don't mind if we do something a little out of the ordinary?" I asked. 

 I saw her get nervous. "I don't do pain. I don't do raw. Anal's another $50, each time. No hitting, and no gangbangs." 

 "Nothing like that. I promise. Blowjobs only. But there's a little more to it than that." I explained my idea, and at first she looked confused, then started to smile. 

 "What's your name?" she asked me abruptly. 

 "Call me John." 

 "No, really." 

 My turn to flash my ID. "John." 

 She laughed. "Weird night, John the John." 

 "You're telling me? I went out of the house to cool off, get a little work in, have a quiet dinner. Now I've got a cute little street walker in my car about to blow my mind. Not how I imagined this day working out." 

 "You seem like a nice guy, John. That's cool for a change. Kind of sweet you still want to work things out with your wife. How come you don't just kick her to the curb?" 

 "What's your name?" I asked. 

 "Kelly. Amethyst if you want a working name, but you already saw my license." 

 "Alright Kelly. I love my wife. I love my 3 month old daughter more than life itself. I don't want to lose them." 

 "She's lucky. And pretty damn stupid if you don't mind my saying so. Good looking man, good job from the looks of things, kind, generous, and in love. Shit, she doesn't deserve you." 

 We cruised past Rock Creek Park, and I turned onto East-West Hwy, on the final stretch home. 

 "You Ok with my plan?" I asked. 

 "Better than Ok. I'll do whatever you need. You just let me know." 

 "You want to tell me how come you're not in high-school and out on the street?" I asked quietly. 

 She looked out the window, quiet. In profile she looked a little older, a little weary. "Bad luck and stupid choices. I can call your wife stupid because I know it well. I made some mistakes, and I'm paying for it now." 

 "I'm a good listener." 

 She turned to me. "I bet you are. It's not a fun story, John. For the moment, let's just pretend we're two people who like each other and are going to have a good time. Really good. I don't want to think about the past, and I don't have a lot to look forward to. Let's live in the moment." 

 She folded her feet up under her, those $10 heels digging into my leather seats. I didn't say anything about it. "You said she's a great cock-sucker. Tell me why she's good." 

 I was off the highway and turning onto the side streets of my neighborhood. "She loves to do it. Loves everything about it. Loves the feel and taste of my cum. Anyone's cum, I should say, although I didn't know that until today." 

 "How does she love it?" Kelly asked. 

 "It's not that she's the best technically. She's doesn't do a lot of deep- throat, or some kind of special move. It's the way she does it. The way she looks at me and my cock. The excitement in her. She can come from sucking me, I don't even have to touch her. Everything she does tells me how much she loves it, how she wants to win my cum, suck it out, hold it in her mouth for ages, with a silly little grin on her face." 

 "If she holds it in her mouth forever, I guess you don't get back-to-back blows," she said. 

 "No. Morning, noon and night, all I want, one at a time." 

 Kelly laughed. "That's changing tonight. I'll drain you. I'm going to suck you over and over until you can't get it back up." 

 She was looking at my tenting crotch, and laughed sweetly. "You are a man, after all. You like that idea, don't you? I can see part of you does." She reached over and put her hand on my stiffness. "Nice. I'm sure I can work with this." 

 I pulled into the driveway, and saw that it was after 1:30 and the lights were still on. 

 "This might get a little weird and awkward. You still alright with it?" 

 She nodded. "Honestly, John. I'd do it for free, if I didn't need the money so damn much. I hope it works out." 

 * * * 

 I had my key out, but the door wasn't locked. I opened it, and Wendy rushed into my arms, hugging me, crying. 

 "Shhh," I whispered, stroking her hair. 

 "God, John. I was so worried you'd left me. I love you so much. We can put all this behind us. I know we can." 

 I pulled her arms off me, gave her a little kiss, and stepped in the door. Kelly followed a couple of steps behind. I saw Wendy's shocked reaction. 

 "What...who is this?" she squeaked. 

 Kelly stepped forward and wrapped her thin arms around my stunned wife. "Hi Wendy, you're even prettier than he said. Thank you so much for welcoming me into your home." She stepped back and looked around. "It's beautiful. Did you do this all yourself, or do you have a decorator?" 

 Wendy was in shock, looking at the common street whore, back at me, then around her house. "I...I did the decorating." 

 "Wow. You have talent. You could do this for a living." Kelly was walking around, touching the furniture, looking at the walls. "Is this an original?" she asked gazing up at the painting over the fireplace. 

 It was my second anniversary gift to my wife. Pricey as hell, a few thousand dollars at a show for an up-and-coming artist. It was her favorite piece. Kelly had a hell of an eye. This wasn't part of what I'd asked her to do. 

 "Original. It was a gift for my second anniversary," Wendy said. 

 "Damn, girl. Hell of a present. Someone must really love you. This guy's good. It fits so well with the decor." Kelly walked around the living room, and into the dining room, kneeling down and lifting the corner of the 9x12 hand knotted rug. "This isn't Turkish is it? Tibetan?" 

 Wendy stood beside her, looking surprised. "Yes. We went to Lhasa last year." 

 "I love the traditional patterns so much more than that contemporary crap. You have wonderful taste." She stood, and smiled. "Can you point me to the ladies' room?" 

 Wendy waved down the hallway. 

 Kelly stepped into her, and gave her another hug, finishing with a kiss on the cheek. "We're going to have so much fun. Thank you." 

 Shit. I was probably as stunned as my confused wife. Kelly was earning every penny, and then some. I'd definitely be rewarding her for this weekend. 

 Wendy followed me into the kitchen, as I got a platter out of the cupboard and started preparing a snack tray. Nothing fancy, but I didn't want Kelly's belly rumbling. "What's going on, John? You're gone all day, and then you bring that into my house?" 

 I completed the snacks, and got out a bottle of our best wine. Nothing too good for my new little cock-sucker to be. 

 "Speak to me John. I want to know what you think you're doing!" she snapped. 

 "Making a little snack tray for our guest. Wouldn't want to be impolite." 

 "She's not our guest, and I don't think I want her in my house." She was standing nearby, talking softly but angrily. 

 "Our house, love. Isn't she charming?" 

 "She looks like a tramp!" 

 "Don't be catty, and try to be polite." I said, passing her three glasses, and taking the snack tray and wine bottle into the living room. 

 "Damn it, John! Tell me what's going on," Wendy whined, following me. 

 "Relax, Wendy. We'll get to that, for now have a drink." 

 I was pouring the wine when Kelly came back out. I was more than a little surprised. She'd washed up a bit, brushed her hair out, removed her trampy makeup and straightened out her clothes. She cleaned up nicely, and looked younger than ever. 

 "I hope you don't mind that I peeked around a little. You have a gorgeous home. The nursery is absolutely adorable. How old is she?" She addressed my wife. 

 Kelly sat down next to me, picking up a canapé and popping it in her mouth, followed by a sip of wine. She'd removed her shoes, and curled her legs up on the couch beside me, while my wife still stood, trying to make sense of it all. 

 "She's three months old. Jeannie's with her grandmother," Wendy said. 

 "Nice wine. You didn't have to break out the good stuff for me," she said, taking a sniff before having another sip. "I can't place it. Napa?" 

 "French. Château Mont-Redon." I said. 

 "Very, very nice. I've been drinking a lot of the Chilean wines, and some small California vineyards, but this is excellent." 

 I guess Wendy felt weird, standing watching us snack, drink and talk about the wine. She finally took her glass, had a big swig, and sat on the chair across the way. 

 Kelly gobbled another canapé, and scooted next to me, placing her hand on my shoulder, stroking me casually. "I bet this wine is John's choice. Bold, strong." 

 "My latest favorite," I told her. 

 "Let me guess. Wendy, you're more of a Pinot Noir girl. Nothing pretentious, sweet, smooth, bursting with flavor. None of those weak whites for you." 

 Wendy nodded. "Pretty much. I don't like the Whites or Roses so much, and the Cabernet's are a little too strong for my taste." 

 Kelly opened her mouth, while I fed her another snack, giggling. "Trying to fatten me up?" she teased. She turned back to Wendy, leaning against me. "Excellent taste, I might add. In decorating, in wine, and definitely in men." 

 "We're happily married," Wendy snapped. 

 "So John said. He loves you, and I can see you love him. You are so lucky. Believe me, Wendy, I would do nothing to get in the way of your happiness. You seem to have the perfect life here. I'm not the kind of person that would destroy that on a whim. I know what it's worth." 

 "What kind of person are you, then?" Wendy asked. 

 Kelly smiled. "I think you know what kind of person I am." 

 "John doesn't have to pay for sex. He gets all he wants from me, and it's a hell of a lot better than anything he's going to get from you, you little whore!" She was almost screaming. 

 Kelly just smiled. "Wendy, love, I wouldn't dream of having sex with a happily married man. There's no way I would do that. Especially not here, in your home. I wouldn't disrespect you like that," Kelly said. 

 Her actions belied her words as she leaned into me, rubbing her hand across my chest, kissing my shoulder. I put my arm around her, let my hand drift down her side, feeling the smooth exposed skin at her waist. 

 The phone rang, and Wendy looked over at me. Two in the morning. Who the hell would be calling? Only everyone we know, I imagined. I shrugged and she got up and went to the kitchen. 

 Kelly grabbed another of the snacks, down to the last two, and popped it in her mouth before she started opening my pants. 

 "Who the hell are you?" I asked, while I helped her. 

 "Just a $20 whore," she said sadly, pushing my pants down around my ankles. 

 I heard my wife on the phone. "Yes Mom, he came home about half an hour ago, and no he wasn't drunk, but he'd been drinking." 

 Kelly was stroking my cock. "Damn, John. She's such a fucking idiot. Cheating on you when she can come home to this," she said, tugging on my cock. She looked around. "All of this. You deserve better." 

 I didn't answer with more than a sigh, as her mouth descended over my cock. 

 I heard Wendy walking our way. "No, everything is definitely not fine. You won't believe what...OH MY GOD!" she shrieked, seeing Kelly with her face in my lap. 

 She threw the phone across the room, and started over toward us. "What the hell are you doing!" 

 "We're not having sex. It's not a big deal right? Just a blowjob." 

 "How...how could you?" she sobbed, standing only a couple of feet away. I stroked Kelly's hair, as she proved herself, bobbing up and down on my stiffness. 

 "Ask yourself the same question," I told her angrily. "Now please be quiet. I haven't had a good blowjob in almost a month, and I'm really enjoying this one." 

 Wendy ran from the room crying, and I heard the bedroom door slam shut. I wondered if the phone lines were going to get lit up. 

 Kelly pulled off me a second. "Are you really enjoying it?" 

 "Jesus, Kelly. You didn't lie. You are amazing." 

 She smiled, looking up at me. "Everything working out the way you hoped?" 

 "A 1000% better. There's a lot more to you than I thought." 

 She looked sad a moment. "Let's not go there now, Ok? Let me get this first one done with, and then we can settle into some serious play." 

 I hadn't had sex in a couple of days, and hadn't had a blowjob as good as hers in my life. She seemed to enjoy it as much as Wendy, and took great pride in her ability. On top of that she could do things with her mouth and tongue that I'd never even conceived of. It saddened me to wonder where a young girl, barely 18, would learn skills like that. 

 I caressed her small body as her head pistoned up and down my cock. Warm, wet, and teasing, her tongue was active. Her hand stroked my cock, then moved away as her face settled deep, her pert little nose pressing into my belly. 

 It hadn't even been five minutes and I was warning her of my need to finish. I couldn't remember the last time I had to shoot so quick. 

 She stroked me, licking the head of my cock. "You don't have to warn me, John. The deluxe overnight package comes with all rights, including coming in my mouth, and even using my ass if you want, later. That's not really sex either, is it?" She licked my cockhead teasingly, the tip of her tongue caressing the base of the crown. 

 I groaned and her mouth barely captured my spurting cock in time to avoid a mess. She took it all gamely, then sat up and straddled me. She smiled and opened her mouth, showing me a very large milky deposit. She closed her mouth, but I didn't see her swallow. She leaned against me, and I held her, stroking her back. 

 "Mmmm," I heard her purr in my ear. A few seconds later she kissed my neck. "I love it too. Love the feel and taste. I like yours. I'd like more of it. Are you going to continue feeding me tonight?" 

 "Damn, Kelly. That was wonderful. I've never had a better one." 

 She giggled. "I told you. I'm the best." 

 I pulled her away, and went to kiss her, but she turned her face just a bit, my kiss landing on the side of her mouth. "Incredible. I'll admit, some of my wife's have been just as good, in a different way." 

 Kelly laughed. "Now you've done it. Thrown down the gauntlet. I'll show you who's the best! Next one, I'm not going to let you finish until you're begging." 

 I believed her. 

 She stood slowly, then sat back and finished the last of our snacks while draining her glass of wine. "This was kind of you. I appreciate it," she said, toasting me. She gave me a quick peck on the cheek, picking up the plate and taking it to the kitchen. 

 I pulled up my pants, and went over to retrieve our broken phone. I snapped the battery back in, and put the battery cover back on but it wouldn't stay. The display said 'in use' but I didn't feel the need to listen in on whatever was going on. I did wonder a little about what was being said, to who. 

 I grabbed the wine glasses, and found Kelly rummaging through the fridge. 

 "Hungry?" 

 She giggled. "A small snack to keep up my energy. It's going to be a long, long night." She had a piece of cold chicken she was gnawing on. 

 I grabbed a paper napkin, and wiped the corner of her mouth. "I'll make you a great breakfast. I promise." 

 She grinned. "I like bacon." 

 "Who doesn't? Pancakes or waffles?" I asked, moving close to her, easing my arm around her slender waist. 

 "Surprise me. I'm sure I won't be disappointed." 

 She had the milk out and filled her wine glass. She took a long drink, a little white mustache appearing on her upper lip. I couldn't resist reaching out to wipe it clean, licking my finger afterward. 

 "Now what?" she asked, pressing against me. 

 "Seconds," I teased, taking her by the hand and leading her to the back of the house. 

 The door to our bedroom was closed, but cracked open a bit. My reaction the night before made it difficult to stay closed, with the receptacle splintered. I knocked and entered, with Kelly in tow. Wendy was lying in bed, naked except for a pair of panties, talking on the phone. She looked up, pulled the sheet up her body to cover her chest. "I've gotta go now," she spoke into the phone. 

 She looked up at me, her eyes red and puffy. "Are you done humiliating me now?" she asked, sulkily. 

 "I have no intention of humiliating you, baby. I love you. But I'm not done having 'not-sex' yet." 

 She looked beyond me to Kelly, leaning against my back, my hand in hers. 

 "Please, John. I can give you what you need. You don't have to do this anymore. I already told you I'm sorry." 

 She looked so upset, she almost broke me. Still, all I heard were the words, but I still had the images in my brain. The dream, man after man lined up to use her mouth. And she was Ok with it. Oral sex didn't matter. Blowjobs didn't count. 

 I decided to test her, before taking it any further. "Five times you cheated on me. Five times, with three different men." 

 She shook her head. "No, baby. Never. I didn't cheat no matter what you say. They tried to touch me, open my shirt, reach up my skirt, but I stopped them. I told them everything would end if they tried again. I would never allow them anything that was yours. My body is yours and yours alone. I swear. Since before we were married, I've allowed nobody but you." 

 Failed. She still didn't get it. 

 "I understand. I would never cheat on you either." I took off my shirt, and started removing my pants. 

 "Why is she still here?" Wendy asked. 

 I looked over and saw that Kelly was peeling her own shirt off, exposing a pair of perfect little B cup tender young tits. "She's going to stay overnight. I'll take her home later, after we're done not cheating."  

 

 

===

Wendy climbed out of the bed, angrily. "Why are you being such a bastard?" 

 "Five times. Three men." I was naked, and reclined on the bed. 

 "Please," she sobbed. "Don't." 

 "Remember how you offered to have me watch you and Tom? I'd like you to watch us together." 

 "No. I won't," she snapped. 

 "Sit down!" I snapped. "You will, or you'll leave and not come back." 

 The tears rolled down her face, but she sat on the furthest corner of the bed, her face in her hands. 

 I looked over to Kelly, who was down to her panties. She smiled at me. "On or off?" she asked. "Can I trust you?" 

 "You can trust me, but leave them on anyway. I don't want there to be even a hint of impropriety." 

 She pouted, her hands hooked in the sides of her thong, prepared to drop them. Instead she climbed on the bed, and settled in between my legs. "I hope you ate your Wheaties," she teased. 

 What followed was the best blowjob ever. I know she was showing off, demonstrating all she could do. Several minutes of teasing, licking and kisses, had me squirming before her mouth ever encased my cock. She bathed my balls with her tongue, sucking on each individually. Little nips of her teeth tracked around my shaft, followed by the sweetest kisses. 

 Wendy was trying to ignore it, but she kept looking over, then turning away. 

 I groaned when Kelly finally lowered that sweet young mouth over my cock, three inches disappearing into her warm, wet, opening. 

 Wendy looked over, and the tears rolled down her cheeks. She looked up at me and I stared back into her eyes, before I moaned, closing my eyes for moment, when Kelly proved her ability to take my entire cock in her mouth. 

 My wife started to get off the bed, and I snapped at her. "No! Stay here. Watch. Just like you wanted me to." 

 She sat back on the bed, crawling up to me. "I never wanted that. I swear. You asked, not me." 

 Kelly eased back, her hand stroking me steadily, her head bobbing up and down. 

 "No. I told you doing anything behind my back you wouldn't do in front of me was cheating. Don't you understand?" 

 She wiped her face. "Please stop punishing me," she whispered. 

 I reached out and pulled her close, holding her shaking body, her head resting on my chest. I leaned my head to the side, so I could watch Kelly pleasure me. 

 It took longer, but she varied things up, faster, slower, her hand stroking me, her mouth devouring me. She'd pull off, lick and tease the shaft, then work on my balls for a while. She teased my butt-hole, pushing my legs back, sticking out her long tongue and caressing me there. Then she'd go back to work. 

 Wendy had stopped the crying, and rested her head on my shoulder, no longer showing any pretense of not watching. I had my arm around her, my hand caressing that body I knew so well. 

 Whenever I started to get close, Kelly would look up at me smiling. "Uh-uh, not yet handsome," she teased. Then she'd ease off, squeezing the base sharply. 

 "You're killing me, cutie," I moaned, the third time she did it. We'd been at it nearly 30 minutes. A half-hour of unbelievable pleasure. 

 "I promise, you won't die from this," she laughed, then buried her face on my cock, pressing her nose against my belly, shaking her head and humming playfully. 

 "Fuck..." I groaned. 

 She bobbed up and down, looking up at me. She pulled off with a loud 'pop', and grinned. "You know what you have to do, if you want to finish." 

 A few minutes of power-sucking and deep-throat, and I was arching my hips, desperate. "Please, Kelly," I gasped. 

 She gave me a short breather. "Not good enough," she giggled. 

 She hammered her head down my cock, taking me to the root, and holding me there. I felt her finger pushing into my butt, and I groaned loudly. 

 "Finish him," Wendy said softly. "Please." 

 "Kelly," I groaned. 

 She looked up at me, my entire cock inside her mouth. She lifted her eyebrows, inquisitively. 

 "I'm begging." 

 That's all she was looking for. She wrapped her hand around my shaft, stroking me rapidly, her mouth sucking away at the head. I thrust against her, feeling the need peaking. "God, that's good," I moaned, and unloaded between her lips. 

 She sucked and sucked, as I fired off repeatedly. I felt Wendy's fingers dig into my skin, and I looked down at her. Her tit was resting on my chest, her nipple swollen and hard. 

 Kelly drew her lips back slowly, off my cock. She crawled up my body, and opened her mouth showing me her prize. "Mmmm" she hummed. 

 Wendy turned her head away, and I felt her shaking. 

 Kelly laid on me, her head on the shoulder opposite Wendy. I wrapped my arm around her. "Thank you. That was amazing." 

 She gave a little wiggle, one leg between mine, rubbing against my cock. I reached down and squeezed her tight little buns. 

 "No!" Wendy snapped. "Don't touch her like that." 

 She was right, and I moved my hand up to Kelly's waist, giving her a squeeze. 

 "You're right. I'm sorry, baby. That was over the line," I said. 

 "Sowwy," Kelly gargled, and I realized she was still holding my cum in her mouth. 

 I spanked her bottom. "Swallow, you little cum slut." 

 She turned her head and looked up at me, pouting. "Do ah haff oo?" 

 "Jesus, you're as bad as her," I laughed. 

 Wendy slapped me on the belly. "Bad? You love it," she said. Her voice dropped. "I thought you loved my blowjobs." 

 "I do. I did, until you started passing them out to every Tom, Dick and Harry." 

 She kissed my neck. "I'm sorry, John. I didn't know. I swear I'll never do it again." 

 "Why?" I asked. 

 "Because I hate this. What it's done to us. Driving us apart. I never meant for any of this to happen. I love you, baby. I know you love me. Despite all this." 

 Kelly surprised the hell out of me, and Wendy too, I'm sure, when she slapped my wife in the face. "Stop the lying, you stupid bitch, if you ever want him back." 

 Wendy sat up, shocked, then reached across me her fingers clawing at my teenage toy. I sat up between them, holding them apart, taking a bit of a beating myself. 

 "STOP!" I yelled, pushing them apart. 

 They seemed to settle down for a second, and I faced Kelly. "Don't you ever hit my wife again." 

 "She's lying to you! She knows it's wrong. She's a cheating slut and she knows it. You deserve so much more," Kelly yelled. 

 "Bitch! I'm not the one who cheated. I never took anyone to my bed. Never rubbed my tits all over them, never let them play with my ass," Wendy screamed back. 

 I turned to Wendy, who still didn't get it. How could she be so thick? "Never let anyone play with your ass? I must have been watching some other slut dancing at last year's Christmas party. Some other bimbo with Dave's hands clutching at her ass, dancing to our song. Another wife of mine, rubbing her tits against her dance partner." 

 Wendy gasped. "That's different, John. I was drunk and we were only dancing. I already told you I was sorry for that." 

 "Funny, Misty thought it looked like you guys were fucking on the dance floor. He was hard, rubbing his cock against you. You looked like you were enjoying it." 

 "It's not my fault they all get hard. I can't help that," she snapped. "Why would you bring that up now?" 

 "I listened to your excuses and accepted your apologies then. Now I can't help but wonder if you cheated on me." 

 "How could you say that? I never cheated on you. Not once. We made love all that weekend. We conceived Jeannie after that party!" she exclaimed. 

 "You conceived that weekend. Is Jeannie even mine? Did you slip off with Dave or one of your other so attentive partners and cuckold me? Did you bring me home sloppy seconds? I remember mentioning that your panties were soaked. Now I wonder. I wonder about everything. Your behavior at the pool party, 6 months pregnant. What you do during the day, when I'm at work. Who you're blowing, rubbing your tits against. Who else is fondling that amazing ass that's supposed to be only for me. How long you've been a faithless cheating slut. I guess I'll always wonder now." 

 She looked like she'd been slapped. "How could you say that? Any of it! I'm not a cheater. Do you hate me that much now?" 

 "I don't hate you. It would be so much easier if I did. I love you, heart and soul. I have for six years, since our very first date. You shit all over my love for you, with Tom, Aaron, Jarrod, and who knows how many others. You tore my fucking heart out, and danced on it with those $300 come-fuck-me 4 inch heels you just had to have." 

 She was crying softly. "Never, John. I never cheated. I never blew anyone but those three. The rubbing and touching was only flirting like everyone does." 

 "I don't. My wife is enough for me. Or at least she was." 

 "But their wives aren't enough for them," she said. "You got me. They had to settle for second best. Of course they're jealous. They only get a shadow of what you get every day. One drunken night's hint. Their wives even thank me for teasing them. We're not the only ones fucking our brains out after the parties. They go home to their second class wives, and you get me." 

 Kelly laughed. "I think I'm going to get sick. You really want to stay married to this conceited cheating slut? Trust me, she's a lost cause. You did right coming looking for me. You don't need..." she looked at Wendy with obvious disgust, "that." 

 "I do. I love her. Sad, isn't it?" 

 Kelly just shook her head. 

 "Wendy, why don't you go to the guest room? We can talk about this in the morning," I told her. 

 She looked stunned. "You want me to leave? This is my bed." 

 I took her hand in mine. "I didn't want to hurt you anymore. I didn't think you'd want to be here with us." 

 "Us? You're keeping her in our bed, and sending me away?" 

 "Yes, I'm keeping her here. She's going to go down on me again, and then we're going to sleep, and she's going to blow me in the morning before I make us breakfast." 

 "Why?" she asked pitifully. 

 "Because I want to not-cheat some more. I promise I won't have sex with her, and I'll try to keep my hands off her cute little ass." 

 Kelly giggled. "You like my cute little ass?" 

 I didn't even turn toward her. "Please, Kelly, you're not helping." 

 "She cheated on you, John. By her rules you can fuck my cute little ass all night long. You'll love it, and I will too. No baby making so it's not cheating, right?" 

 Wendy snapped at me. "You told her? About us? You told some cheap little whore?" 

 "You told every one of our friends all about us. That's no big deal, right? Your words not mine. I told my friend." 

 She closed her eyes, lowering her head. I grabbed her chin and lifted it, making her look up at me. "She's not a cheap little whore. She's quite expensive. $200 for the visit. Not counting the substantial tip she'll be receiving." 

 "Don't forget our bet," Kelly teased. 

 "I won't. It'll be a very, very substantial tip." 

 She giggled. "I told you." 

 "I'm not leaving my bed," Wendy said. "Do what you have to do. You're not chasing me away this easily." 

 I laid back on the bed, and Wendy snuggled in next to me. "Her ass is still off limits, you understand? No ass, and no pussy, or I will leave you. I can't take that. I can't." 

 Kelly skinned off her panties, and turned on her hands and knees, wiggling that delectable butt. "Not her rules, John. It's yours, bought and paid for. Fuck my ass and make me scream for you. Tight and practically virgin, believe it or not. I'd love you to fill my ass with that big cock, and finish in my mouth." 

 I leaned over and swatted her cute rear. "You are rotten. I'm not doing anything she hasn't done. In spite of her words. Not that I wouldn't love to pound that adorable butt of yours into submission." 

 Wendy poked me. "You can pound mine into submission. I'd still let you finish in her mouth if you want," she teased. 

 I laughed. "Really?" 

 She shrugged. "You're going to keep giving her those loads that should be mine. I wouldn't mind getting something out of it." 

 I reached down and slid my fingers into her panties. She slapped my hand away, but not before I knew. 

 "Jesus, Wendy. You're dripping!" 

 She blushed. "It's almost 3:00 am. I've been watching her suck my cock forever. I can't help it." 

 "I don't think it'll be long, baby. I still believe we can make this right. I do love you. I just don't think we're on the same page yet." 

 "Soon? It'll be over soon? You'll forgive me?" Wendy asked. 

 Kelly had given up on her display, and crawled back between my legs, her mouth sucking on my cock, trying to resuscitate it. 

 "I've forgiven you. I forgave you last night. But we still have our problems to work through." 

 "You won't keep cheating on me after, will you?" 

 "Am I cheating on you?" I asked. I prayed she'd give me the right answer. I was almost hard for Kelly, so her answer, right or wrong wasn't going to change this blowjob. But it might be my last from anyone other than my wife. 

 "You know what I mean. You think it's cheating." 

 Damn she was stubborn. 

 I sighed. "Kiss me, wife." 

 She pressed her lips to mine, tentatively at first, then more passionately. I moaned into her mouth, as Kelly took me deep, goading me. 

 "Love me, John," Wendy whispered. "Love only me. You don't need her." 

 "I don't need her, but damn she's good," I whispered. I gasped when she took me to the root, pounding her throat up and down on my cock. 

 "Better than me?" Wendy asked tentatively. 

 I didn't answer. 

 "Oh, God, John! You have to stop. You have to! Please!" 

 "It's only a blowjob, baby. I love you," I said. 

 I guess Kelly was paying attention. "Best damn blowjob you ever had, or will ever have, and you know it." 

 "Suck, sweetie. And yes, you give an incredible blowjob." 

 "Best?" she teased, licking my cock. She took me in her throat again, which she knew my wife didn't do. 

 "Alright, damn it. You're the best. Now finish me, no dragging it out and making me beg, it's getting late. 

 She pulled off, laughing. "Fine. My jaw's getting pretty damn tired anyway. You've got some serious stamina. Can you hang on like this when fucking?" 

 "You have no idea, slut," Wendy said. 

 "I'm a whore, not a slut. There's only one stupid slut in this bed," she snapped. "Jesus, maybe it's a good thing I didn't let you in my ass," Kelly said, before she took me back in her mouth. 

 Wendy rubbed her head against my shoulder. "How could you say that?" she whispered. "How could you say she was better than me?" 

 "How could you let three other men fuck your mouth?" I asked. 

 "I told you, they were nothing. A couple of minutes and a quick squirt." 

 "Are any of them bigger than me? Is that what you wanted? A big fat cock to suck? Does Aaron have a big black cock? Is that your problem?" 

 "I'd never want to suck one bigger than yours, John. Too big is no fun." 

 "Answer the question, Wendy." 

 "No. It was never about size. I don't want you thinking that. I just like to suck dick. They had one. They wanted me badly, kept at me, badgered me. You didn't want me sucking you anymore. You only wanted in my pussy. Their constant begging, and too much booze, finally made me give in. But I stopped it at sucking. I swear, John. Nothing but sucking." 

 "I want to believe you never did anything more. But that was already too much." 

 She sniffled. I was afraid she was going to start crying again. Then I was distracted by Kelly again. The girl was insatiable. I moaned. 

 "Who was the first? Who got you to succumb?" I asked my slut wife. 

 Kelly snorted, giggling. "That was a really bad pun, lover. Don't make me laugh, or it might make cum squirt out my nose, and that stings." 

 I tried not to grin. "Who, Wendy?" 

 She was quiet for a few seconds. "Tom. It was Tom. He'd never had a blowjob and he just kept pestering and pestering me." She hugged me. "I'm sorry. I knew it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. I didn't think it was that big a deal, really, and I was sure you'd never find out. I figured it was just a blowjob. Not really cheating. I'd never do anything more. I'm so sorry." 

 I wanted to talk about it. I did. I think she was finally beginning to understand. But I couldn't, not with Kelly doing what she was. I tilted Wendy's head back out of the way, so I could concentrate on what Kelly was up to. 

 My naughty little teen looked up at me. "Getting close, aren't you, lover?" 

 I nodded, moaning. 

 "Good. Gimme." She sucked away, head bobbing away merrily. 

 Wendy bit me on the shoulder, hard. "I hate this," she whispered. 

 "I know," I gasped. "I hate what you did." 

 "Finish, damn you, it's almost 4:00 am," Wendy snapped. 

 "I'm close," I told her. 

 That's all Kelly had to hear. She went in for the kill, and within a minute, I was erupting in Kelly's talented mouth. She finished me sweetly, then slid up my body. She showed me her reward, then leaned over to Wendy. Ever so slowly she brought her mouth closer to my wife's. Wendy pulled back a bit, then stopped retreating, letting Kelly's lips meet hers. 

 Jesus. If they kept this up, I'd need to get off again. 

 Their mouths stayed together for several long seconds, dragging on and on. I found myself caressing Kelly's ass, squeezing her tight cheeks absentmindedly. She moaned, and her sweet sounds were echoed by Wendy's. I slid my hand down my wife's body, fondling her. 

 Kelly pulled away, and brushed my hand off her ass. "Be good." 

 Wendy reached out to Kelly. "Thank you." 

 Kelly nodded, and I saw her eyes were moist. "That was for admitting you knew it was wrong. He's yours. Not mine. I would never have cheated on him." She bounced off the bed, and planted a quick moist kiss on my lips. "I gotta pee, and I could use a snack. You don't mind?" 

 "Knock yourself out. And thanks," I told her. 

 She grinned. "Weirdest night ever. Can I bring you guys back anything?" 

 "Water," both Wendy and I said at the same time. 

 Kelly laughed. "Jeez, you guys sound like an old married couple." She winked at us, and scurried down the hall. 

 Wendy poked me. "God, I want to hate her. Where the hell did you find her?" 

 "Downtown, 11th and L." 

 "You were trolling for whores?" 

 "No. I was driving through the area. I wasn't planning on it, and wasn't expecting it. Even after she got in my car, I think I just wanted to talk. She had offered me a $20 blowjob, and she had me thinking." 

 "Did you do it?" 

 "Not until we got here." 

 "To punish me?" she asked sadly. 

 "No, so you could see that a blowjob was more than you thought. It was devastating to me." 

 "I know. You fucking tore my heart out tonight, you bastard." 

 "I didn't do it to hurt you. I need to make things right between us," I explained. 

 "I understand. It's cheating. I get it. Don't you believe that I really didn't think I was cheating on you?" 

 I kissed her. Finally, maybe she gets it. "I do. But that didn't make it right. You hurt me." 

 "The most horrible thing I ever did. I know that now. I'll make it up to you, I swear. I'm yours, John, if you'll have me. Always." She hugged me tightly, burying her head in my neck. 

 "I'll never let you go, baby. I love you too much. That's why it hurt so bad." 

 She nodded. "Are we good now?" She sounded anxious. 

 "Better. We still have to make things right." 

 "Right? How?" 

 "Aaron, Jarrod and Tom. Tom especially, he has to pay." 

 "Don't do anything stupid, honey. Please, it's not worth it," she whined. "Besides, they're our friends." 

 "Stop saying that! Once they stuck their cocks in your mouth, they became enemies, not friends. You want to stay friends with them, that's fine. You can move in with them and suck their cocks all you want!" 

 Wendy shrank away from me and finally had the good sense to shut the hell up. Every time I thought things were getting better, she had to cock it up again. 

 Kelly came waltzing into the room, with bottles of water in one hand, and a half-eaten sandwich in the other. She tossed two of the bottles onto the bed, did a cute little spin, and practically danced into the bathroom.

"How much are we paying her?" Wendy asked. 

 "I haven't decided yet. I've already given her two hundred." 

 "That seems pretty cheap. I wouldn't sell my blowjobs for $100 a pop. Even if they're not as good as hers." 

 "Don't say that. I love your blowjobs, and because they're yours, they'll always be better than anyone's," I told her, stealing a quick kiss. 

 "How much would you pay, husband mine?" she teased. 

 I was still feeling a little pissed. "Let's see, in the last month I got 2 blowjobs. You're not cheap to keep you know. Between half of the household cost, your car, your insurance, shopping, hair-care, mani-pedis, eating out, God, you must run me six grand a month easy. Three grand a blowjob, is what I'm paying. Even without the house, it's gotta be at least $1500. Shit, I had no idea your BJs were so damn costly. Kelly really is a bargain!" 

 Wendy smacked me, just as Kelly walked back in the room. "Should...should I leave?" the sexy little teen asked tentatively. 

 I patted the bed beside me. "I need you around for the morning, Angel." 

 Kelly grinned and hopped on the bed, almost bouncing Wendy off. "You guys are better when you're not fighting." She snuggled up next to me, kissing my cheek. "Do you have any idea how lucky you are, you silly slut?" 

 "Yes, and could you please put some panties on, you teasing little whore? He's just a man, and I don't want you accidentally ending up impaled in the night. I can't believe he's resisted that tight little teen body. You know that's not fair, right?" 

 "He'd resist me forever. He doesn't love me. I should be so lucky." Still, she slid off the bed, and slipped her thong back on. 

 Wendy sighed. "Like that covers anything." She got up and dug into her drawer, pulling out a sealed bag. She tossed it across the room. "Brand new." 

 Kelly peeled off her thong, opened the bag, and pulled on the plain white panties. "Jesus, I feel like I'm back in middle-school," she griped, adjusting them. "Is this what you wear for him? No wonder he came looking for me." 

 "Kill the light, Angel? And come to bed," I said. 

 She hit the wall switch, and I felt her cuddle up to me. I was exhausted, and happier than I should have been, after what my wife had done. I held both women against my body, and tried to sleep. It wasn't long before I felt Kelly's slender body shaking, and felt her tears on my shoulder. 

 "Shh," I whispered, hugging her close. 

 "Thank you for tonight," she whispered. "I'd almost forgotten how nice normal is." 

 Wendy's body was trembling, and I heard her soft sobs, as she tried to stifle them. Jesus, two crying women. That's all I needed. 

 "It's Ok, baby," I whispered, not even sure myself who I was talking to. 

 ====================== 

 I hope you enjoyed it so far. I've submitted a few chapters at once, so they should probably come out on subsequent days. As always, your votes and comments are welcome and appreciated.

======================== 

 With understanding comes responsibility, and absolution 

 ======================== 

 I woke, and it was still dark out. I experienced that incredible feeling of a warm mouth on my cock. I slowly came to, enjoying the sensation. I felt a body pressed against my side, an arm thrown across my chest. Kelly was clinging to me in her sleep. 

 "Mmmm, that's nice, dear," I murmured. 

 The sucking stopped. "Nice? Not the best?" 

 "You're always the best. Love makes all the difference." 

 "This is my cock, John. I don't want you giving it to anyone else." 

 "And those are my lips, baby. I don't want them sucking anybody else." 

 "I won't. Not ever again. I swear," she said. "Are you going to stop?" 

 "Just a few more, and I'll stop." 

 She squeezed my shaft hard. "No. You have to stop now." 

 It had been so nice, but now she was pissing me off. I leaned down and pulled her hand off my cock. "You don't get to make that decision anymore. You were the one that decided that a blowjob wasn't sex." 

 "I said I'm sorry." 

 "Five blowjobs, that I know of, Wendy. Five. Three different men. You want me to find two more women to suck me off? Maybe their wives will do it. I bet they'll be angry enough." 

 "No, baby. I don't want anybody to suck you ever again but me." 

 "I've paid for Kelly, and I'm going to use her talented mouth until I'm completely satisfied. Do you understand?" 

 "No! I won't let you. That's not fair!" 

 "You've been doing it behind my back for weeks with different men, who by now have told everyone they know. That's not fair. How about this? I'll find out how many people know you've been blowing other men, and for each person I get one more blowjob. Doesn't that seem fair?" 

 "I don't want to fight. If you love me, you'll stop. I can't stand it. Why do you have to humiliate me?" 

 "Humiliate you? Nobody ever has to know what's going on this weekend. Nobody will look at you, laughing behind your back, because they know I've cheated on you. You don't have to face that, but I do. Damn it, Wendy! Some of those people work with me. How am I ever supposed to act normal with them, when they know I wasn't good enough for you? That you cheated on me." 

 "No, baby. It's not like that. It isn't. They know I wouldn't cheat on you, no matter how hard they tried. And they did try." 

 "Are we back to believing that blowjobs aren't cheating? That they're not sex?" 

 She got quiet. 

 "Go to sleep, Wendy. Just leave me alone and go to sleep." 

 I rolled over and turned my back to her, taking Kelly in my arms, and holding her soft, frail body against mine. I cupped her small breast in my hand. I heard my wife crying before I nodded off again, but didn't have a lot of sympathy for her. She still didn't get it. Didn't understand how she'd ruined our life. 

 * * * 

 I woke and the room was bright, the light streaming in. I was curled around my little whore, spooning her, my morning erection pressed against her cute little butt. 

 My arm was being tugged on, and I looked over my shoulder. My wife was pulling on me. 

 "Hold me, John. Hold your wife, please. I'm scared." 

 I relinquished my grip on our guest, and turned to Wendy. She rolled onto her side, and I snuggled in behind her. I put my arm around her and she clung to it. 

 "I love you, baby. You've done your best to destroy our life, but I still love you," I whispered, kissing her soft shoulder. 

 "Just this weekend, and it's over, right?" she whispered. 

 "I hope so." 

 "What does that mean?" she asked nervously. 

 "When you understand the problem, what you've done, what the impact is, why it's so terrible, then it's over. I'm hoping it's before the weekend is past." 

 "I do understand. I hurt you, and I'm so very sorry." 

 "Shhh. You don't. Not yet. Go back to sleep, and we'll talk about it later, Ok?" 

 She nodded, and gripped my arm even tighter. 

 I closed my eyes, trying not to think about our problems. After a bit I felt a body press against my back, and a skinny little arm wrapped around me. It felt good to be pressed between their two bodies. I relaxed, thinking about what I was going to make for brunch. 

 * * * 

 I woke alone, with someone yanking on my foot. I opened my eyes and sat up, seeing my naked wife and Kelly in her plain white panties at the foot of the bed. Wendy looked upset, and Kelly looked even angrier. Kelly had her hand on my foot, shaking it. 

 I sat up, looking at them. "What's going on?" 

 Kelly glared at my wife. "She says you don't want any more blowjobs. That you want me to leave. She tried to give me $500 and wants to call a cab. Is that true? Why didn't you tell me yourself?" 

 "Because she's lying, Angel," I explained groggily. "We both know she's a liar, but don't hold it against her. She feels threatened. She understands now that blowjobs are cheating, but still won't accept what that means to our marriage." 

 "John!" Wendy snapped. "How can you say that? How can you call me a liar?" 

 I laughed. "You lied. That's how." 

 "I never lied to you. She needs to leave, that's all." 

 "No. She needs to blow me now. I've got a nice case of morning wood that needs tending." 

 Kelly smirked, and pulled off her underwear. "I'm not going to wear some lying cheating slut's fat-ass panties." She jumped on the bed, pulling my covers off, and dove for my cock. 

 Wendy came around the bed and sat down next to me. "Can't we stop? I do understand now. I do." 

 "No you don't. Lying isn't helping things either." 

 "Let me suck you. Not her." 

 "You could have sucked me last night, but you decided to make demands and leave me hanging. I'm not going to have that happen again. Besides, when's the last time you woke me with a blowjob or sucked me as eagerly as this sweet girl?" 

 "Don't say that! You know I've always loved sucking you. Hell, I'm the only wife you know that gives her husband as many blowjobs as you get." 

 "When? When was the last time? I'm not denying what we had was wonderful, but somehow you changed, and gave them to everyone but me. When was the last time you initiated it, sucked me like that," I nodded toward my morning BJ Queen, "and finished me." 

 "Three weeks ago. You said so yourself." 

 "No, that was the last time you finished me. I initiated it. When, baby?" 

 She shook her head. "I don't know." 

 "Almost six weeks now. When did you blow Tom for the first time?" 

 She hesitated. "Five weeks ago," she said softly. 

 "Five weeks ago? Where? When?" 

 She lowered her head. "Our barbecue." 

 "Jesus, Wendy! At our home? With everyone here? You are such a fucking slut! How could you?" 

 "I was drunk. He followed me into the garage, and pulled out his stiffie, begging me. It didn't seem like that big a deal. A few minutes, and I'd be his first blowjob. It sounds so stupid now. I'm sorry." 

 "That makes sense. You didn't need me anymore. Right now, I don't need you. So let me enjoy this." 

 "If you don't stop this right now, I'm going to go find someone who wants my blowjobs," she snapped angrily. 

 "Don't let the door hit you on the way out. Kelly is cheaper, and as long as she's on the payroll, I know she's mine and mine alone. We both knew you didn't care about our marriage the moment you let Tom stick his dick in your mouth." 

 "Of course I care about our marriage! You're the father of our baby!" 

 "So you keep saying. I'll believe it when I see the DNA report. You've already proven you're both a cheat and a liar, how can I believe you?" 

 Wendy turned and yelled at Kelly. "Could you stop blowing him as long as we're having a family discussion, you filthy little whore!" 

 "No way. He said I could, and as long as he's distracted, he's not going to come. I may get to do this for hours. You two have your fun." She giggled and gobbled me down again. 

 "Make her stop, John. Just for now. Please? While we talk." 

 "I told you we'd talk this afternoon. Let me finish this in peace, and we can discuss things over brunch, Ok?" 

 She got up angrily. "When did you become such an asshole?" 

 "When I found out I had a lying, cheating slut for a wife. Don't you remember, dear?" 

 She stomped out of the room. 

 Kelly giggled, and started twisting around the bed, until she was straddling my head while sucking me. "It's yours, lover. Bought and paid for. All cleaned up. Nobody in there for a few days. Oral is 'not-sex', remember?" 

 It was probably wrong, but it was my wife who insisted that oral sex wasn't cheating, and I had to admit, Kelly had the prettiest little pussy I'd ever seen. Hard to believe it was attached to a common street whore. 

 I started playing with her, opening her up, fingering her. She smelled good, and I moved my head forward and tasted her. I hadn't tasted anyone but my wife for at least six years. After a few minutes I was eating her like my life depended on it. 

 I was getting to her, and I felt a perverse pride. She was moaning softly, and twitching now and then. I sucked on her clit, and she trembled, moaning around my cock. 

 I felt her stop moving down below. "God, lover, I'm almost there," she whispered. 

 I wrapped my arms around her skinny ass, and pulled her down hard against my mouth, tonguing her. She was making the sexiest little noises, pressing back against me. She squealed, her legs tensing, and came on my tongue. 

 I eased up, licking her softly, until she stopped shaking. 

 She spun around on top of me, her soft breasts pressing against my chest. She brought her lips to mine and kissed me, really kissed me, for the first time, her tongue searching for mine. I let my hands caress her body while we enjoyed each other. 

 She finally pulled away, with one last soft kiss. "Damn, John! That was so good. You didn't have to do that, you know." 

 "I wanted to." 

 "Since when?" she teased, kissing my neck. 

 "About thirty seconds after you entered my house. You're not a whore. Why are you doing this?" 

 She stopped kissing me. "I am. I sell my body. I'm sorry, but it's the truth." She sounded sad. Then she perked up and kissed me on the lips. "The good news is, I sold it to you. Wanna fuck me? She's never going to figure it out, you know. I'll be good. My blowjobs are better, but I know you'll like it, and I'm still pretty tight." She grinned, and kissed me again. "I won't even make you use a rubber. I'm clean, and I know you are too. I'd love to feel you shoot up inside of me." 

 "Right now, all I want to do is hold you, beautiful. Is that Ok?" 

 She smiled, a genuine one for once. "I think I'd like that." 

 So I did. I held her, lying on top of me, and kissed the top of her head. After a few minutes she whispered. "We should stop." 

 "Why?" 

 "You shouldn't get attached to me. I'll be leaving soon, and you'll never see me again." 

 "What if I want to see you again?" I asked. 

 "No. I'm not going to break up your marriage. You two love each other. I'm not sure why, but it's obvious. You'll get past this. Don't make me the cause, please?" 

 "A couple more minutes, then." 

 She nodded. "That would be nice." 

 It was maybe five minutes later when she got up. She had her fake smile back on, and it broke my heart. "Alright, big boy. I'm gonna suck your brains out your cock." 

 I laughed, grabbing her and giving her a hug. "No, you're going to take a luxurious bath, while I start breakfast. There will be plenty of time for sucking later." 

 "Promise?" 

 "Cross my heart and hope to die. Go clean up, you smell like cum." 

 She laughed. "Working girl's curse. Don't forget the bacon." 

 I left her, pulled on some shorts and went in search of my wife. I found her in the kitchen on the phone. She saw me, turned away and ended her call. 

 "Who was that?" 

 "Nobody," she said. 

 I snatched the phone from her and checked the call log. "Your sister. Hasn't she caused enough trouble?" 

 "What? You're going to blame bringing a hooker home on her?" 

 I dialed the number, and Alice picked up. "Is she still there?" she asked. 

 "Good morning Alice. Put Dave on." 

 She hung up on me. 

 I handed Wendy the phone. "If I don't speak to Dave in 5 minutes, I'm throwing you out of the house, and we're done." 

 She looked shocked. "What?" 

 "You heard me. Dave on the phone in 5 minutes." 

 "I can't make him do that," she argued. 

 "Your sister can. I'm not joking. She's poisoned you. You keep going back for more, like a dog eating its own vomit. I swear, Wendy, if I'm not talking to him in 5, your ass is out of here, I'll start the divorce proceedings on Monday, and I'm going back up those stairs and fucking the living shit out of Kelly in every hole. Probably all week long. Your choice." 

 She grabbed the phone from me angrily, and ran from the room. 

 I started laying out the food choices, and turned on the waffle iron. Wendy came back about a minute later. "He's not there." 

 "Less than four minutes." 

 "HE'S NOT THERE! I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT!" she screamed at me. 

 "Not my problem. Find out where he is, get a message to him, whatever it takes." 

 She stomped out of the room, returning less than a minute later. "She won't do it." 

 "Two minutes, love." 

 "She won't. She won't call him. She doesn't want you talking to him." 

 "I guess she's happy enough to destroy your marriage, as long as it doesn't interfere with hers. Quite the loving sister. You might want to get dressed, you don't want to go out the door dressed like that." 

 "Stop it, John. Stop badgering me and threatening me. You're going to destroy us." 

 "No, you already did that, with your sister's help." I put the bacon in the pan, but put two of the eggs back in the refrigerator. 

 "I tried, John. I did. She was right, all you want is to be able to fuck other girls. I'm not going to put up with that. You want your damn divorce so much? You can have it. I'm leaving you." 

 "Why don't you call your sister and see if you can stay with her?" 

 "Fine! I will. I'm going to take your child away, and make your life hell! I get half of everything. Half of your savings. Half of your 401K. You're going to have to give me money, and if you don't give me enough you're never going to see your little girl again. How do you like that?" 

 "Sounds like your sister is giving you advice." 

 "That's right. I don't need you. I don't have to put up with this. I did nothing wrong. You're the cheater here, bringing home a whore into our bed. Not me." 

 "Call her. Tell her you're moving in." 

 "I HATE YOU!" she screamed at me, turning away. 

 The mix was ready, and I started on the first waffle. I jogged down to the master bath. "How do you want your eggs, Angel?" She was cute as a button, sitting back in a tub full of bubbles. 

 "Over easy," she said, "If it's not too much trouble." 

 I grabbed one of my t-shirts and left it in the bathroom. "Why don't you wear this when you get out? I think you'd look sexy in it." 

 She smiled. "I love to wear my man's shirt. Is she really leaving?" 

 "Probably not. She won't realize that for a few minutes." 

 "Shit. After all that screaming, I thought maybe you'd come to your senses and we'd finally get to have some real fun." 

 "It's not out of the question," I teased. "Gotta go before something burns." 

 I finished cooking before Wendy returned to the kitchen. "She won't let me stay there." 

 "Of course not. She can't have Dave asking questions now, can she?" I walked over and gave her a hug. She was stiff, then grabbed me and started crying. 

 "Shhh. If you're going to talk to anyone, talk to your mother, or Marcie." 

 "Why Marcie?" 

 "She's been divorced twice. Got caught cheating once, and had a husband who cheated on her. She can keep a secret, and she'll understand. Plus, as far as I can tell, you didn't give her husband a blowjob." 

 "Do I have to leave?" 

 "No. I'll find a way to talk to Dave. But you have to stop talking to your sister. You understand that, don't you?" 

 "No, not really. She's only trying to help." 

 "Talk to your mother. Tell her everything. Then you'll understand, Ok?" 

 "You don't even like my mother." 

 "Sometimes I don't. But I respect her and your father, and I know she loves you and her granddaughter almost as much as I do." 

 "You're not going to fuck that little whore, are you?" 

 "That little whore, as you like to call her, cares a lot more about our marriage than your sister does. Hell, after your behavior, probably more than you. She wouldn't let me fuck her, as you so eloquently put it, if it would interfere with our marriage, no matter how much I paid her." 

 Kelly walked in, dressed in my shirt, and drying her hair with a towel. She stepped up to me and held her lips up for a kiss. Of course I obliged. 

 "He's right, you know. I wouldn't let him. Not unless I really believed it was over. Why don't you and me talk after we eat?" 

 "Why would I want to talk to you?" Wendy snapped. 

 "Because I want to help you. I won't judge you. And I know a little bit about where you're coming from. You don't want to end up like me." 

 "I'd never become a whore!" 

 "I don't mean that. I mean alone. Believe me, that's much worse. After we eat, Ok? 'Cause I'm starving," she said grinning. "Gotta keep the strength up you know. Whoring isn't easy work." 

 We ate under a flag of truce. No talk about blowjobs, or cheating. No name calling. We talked about Jeannie, and our home. About my work, and the chances that the 'Skins would ever be good again. We discussed art, and what would look good in the dining room. It was a nice, normal conversation. 

 At the end, Kelly got up, thanking me. "Can we postpone the next BJ for a while? And can you take care of the dishes? Please?" 

 "Of course. You girls chat as much as you want. I can watch some football and relax." 

 Maybe not the wisest move, at least in the short term. I put everything away then headed for a shower. The girls were in the bedroom, and the bed was made. Kelly was wearing an outfit of Wendy's. When I opened the door, they walked out, whispering, letting me use the bathroom. 

 After cleaning up, I returned to the family room, and the girls got quiet, and headed back. They both stopped for a moment to give me a kiss, which was nice. I had a couple of beers watching the Redskins win, amazingly. Our rookie QB, RG III was beginning to look like a savior. I got up to make a snack before settling in for the second game. 

 I knew they weren't keeping the discussion to themselves. The phone rang a couple of times, but it was picked up immediately. I had no inclination to hunt down a phone or listen in. I could only hope they were using their heads as to who to get involved. 

 I decided to make up a tray for the girls, and opened a bottle of Wendy's Pinot Noir. I knocked on the bedroom door, where I could hear them jabbering away. 

 "Come in," Wendy called out. 

 I opened the door. "I'm not here to intrude or chase you out," I said disarmingly. "I thought you might like a snack." 

 They were sitting cross-legged on the bed, facing each other, knees touching. 

 "I'll just leave this here," I said. "Let me know if you need anything else." 

 Kelly looked at Wendy smirking. "See? Does that look like a man who doesn't love you?" 

 I was stunned by her words. I went over and sat down beside my wife. "Surely you don't believe that?" 

 She shook her head. "I don't know what to believe. I'm so confused, John." 

 I put my arms around her. "I love you. More than anything in the world. Don't think for a moment I don't. No matter what else happens. I love you, and I always will. You're the best thing that ever happened to me." 

 I gave her a kiss on the cheek. "I'll be watching the game if you need me." 

 Kelly hopped off the bed and met me at the door. "I'm sorry it's taking so long. I think we're going to be a lot longer. Is that Ok?" 

 "Of course. I think I'll order out for dinner. Chinese for everyone?"  

 

 

===

They both nodded, then Kelly wrapped her arms around my neck. "It's going to be alright. I know it is." She pulled me down for a quick kiss. "Did we win?" 

 I smiled. "Kicked ass." 

 She held her hand up for a high-five. "Alright!" She did a little victory dance that had me hardening. 

 I laughed at her cute antics, and made myself scarce. 

 They cleaned up their own mess, and waltzed through the house, chattering, sitting out on the porch for a while. I didn't think they'd last long, it was pretty cold outside. During a break in the game, I looked out, and they were gone. I walked to the double doors, and saw them in the yard. They were hugging each other. Not what I'd expected, but I wasn't about to interfere. 

 They came in a little later, and I could see they'd both been crying. 

 "Everything alright?" I asked. 

 Wendy came over and sat in my lap, putting her arms around my neck. "No. Not yet. But it will be, I promise." She kissed me tenderly, and I held her. "I love you, John. You're my entire world." 

 I smiled, kissing her back. "I love you too." 

 "I had Mom pick up Jeannie. I thought we'd give your mother a break. We don't have to pick her up until tomorrow afternoon." 

 "I miss her." 

 "Me too. I think it's good for us to be away from her. To know how things might have been." 

 "Don't say that. We're going to be fine." 

 She nodded. "I know. Thank you for my life, I could never have asked for a better man." She pressed her lips to mine, and I could see the tears filling her eyes. She got up. "I'm sorry. I really fucked up." 

 "It's done. We'll get past it." 

 She smiled, and walked back to the bedroom. 

 Kelly climbed in my lap. "Can I have some of that? Please?" 

 I hugged her, and kissed her softly. "Thank you," I whispered. 

 She shrugged. "She would have gotten there eventually. She adores you, you know. This has been really hard on her." 

 "I know. I wish it had never happened." 

 "No, you'll be better for it. Stronger. You'll never have a crisis like this again." 

 I gave her a squeeze. "How did such a young lady become so wise?" 

 "I'm only young on the outside, John." She kissed me again, and I tasted her salty tears before we stopped. 

 She got up and chased after my wife, leaving me befuddled once again. 

 At the beginning of the fourth quarter, I placed the call to Hunan Palace. I ordered far more than we could eat, since I didn't know what Kelly would like, and I enjoy leftovers anyway. 

 I went back and knocked on the door. "Food will be here in 30 to 40 minutes," I announced. 

 Kelly opened the door, grinning. She grabbed me by the hand. "Perfect. Just enough time for a blowjob." 

 She laughed, dragging me into the room, then was on her knees opening my pants. She pulled them down to my ankles. Wendy was watching us with a smile. 

 Kelly turned and pushed me to sit down on the bed while she struggled to get my shoes and socks off. "Get his shirt," she said. 

 My wife crawled over on her knees, and tugged my shirt off over my head, while Kelly managed to get me naked below the waist. She giggled and pushed me onto my back, then started stripping off her clothes. 

 A couple of times I started to ask questions, but I stopped myself. I'm not as stupid as I look. 

 "Ready for the best blowjob of your life?" Kelly asked, grinning, shaking her cute body for me. 

 "That would have to be from my wife," I told her. 

 "Ding-ding-ding! Give the man a cigar!" Kelly laughed, dropping down onto my chest, and giving me a big wet kiss. "For now on, no blowjobs for either of you, unless it's with each other. Sorry. Them's the rules." 

 I laughed as Wendy settled in between my legs. 

 "Why'd you get undressed?" I asked. 

 "I'm just a little eye-candy. Hell, I've got to earn my pay somehow!" 

 She cuddled up against me, her head on my shoulder, and we both watched as my wife did her absolute best to give me the World's Greatest Blowjob. She looked up at me constantly as she made love to my cock. Every action, every movement screamed out her love for me. 

 "She is the best, isn't she?" Kelly said softly. 

 "Always." 

 "Why'd you say I was?" 

 "You were spectacular, Angel. Physically, technically, superb, without peer. But without the love, it's only a shadow of the real thing." 

 Wendy had me moaning in pleasure, when she stopped and scooted up the bed. She grabbed my hand, and placed it on Kelly's ass. "I trust you. Enjoy yourself." 

 She grinned at my surprised look, and Kelly giggled. Wendy's lips settled over my shaft again, and Kelly pressed her butt back against my hand. "It is paid for, after all," she teased. "Feel me up, handsome stranger." 

 The truth was, Kelly was a distraction. A very cute and sexy distraction, but I was happy to concentrate on the job that my wife was doing. She didn't spend much time actually stroking and sucking me, it was a lot of kissing and licking, rubbing her face against my shaft, kissing my legs and all around my cock. She'd give me maybe a dozen strokes then go back into adoration mode. It was very gratifying, but it was going to take me forever to come. 

 "I'm jealous," Kelly said softly. "I kind of wish that was me down there." 

 I gave her a soft kiss, that lingered, and became more passionate. "You've done your job, Angel. I think we're both going to owe you big time before this all plays out." 

 "Keep feeding me, and make sure you remember to tip well," she teased. 

 I groaned as my wife took as much of my cock into her mouth as she was capable of, pressing hard against the opening of her throat. Give her points for trying. 

 The doorbell rang, and I almost wanted to cry. 

 Kelly bounced up off the bed. "Don't let that interrupt you two. I'll get the door." 

 "The food was paid for by credit card. All you have to do is sign for the tip," I told her. 

 She giggled, doing a little spin. "You don't think answering the door like this is enough of a tip?" 

 "Some of their delivery people are female." 

 She grinned, lifting one eyebrow. "So?" 

 The door rang again. "Go, you ornery little tease." 

 She skipped out of the room laughing. It was nice to see her in such a good mood. 

 My wife took that as a cue to finish me, and she had little difficulty achieving that simple goal. She'd had more than enough practice. She moved out from between my legs, and was lying on her side, her head on my stomach, blocking my view. The nice part was that I could reach her, stroking her hair, caressing her body. 

 I flashed to a vision of her servicing other guys, but it faded quickly. I knew what she'd done, but I also was certain that it was nothing like what she was doing to me. She might have taken them in her mouth, but she'd never made love to another man's cock, of that I was confident. It didn't stop it from irking me that some other bastard had come in her mouth. 

 She wasn't aware of my issues, and continued to bring me to my completion. I didn't provide any verbal warning, the change in my own moans and sounds was familiar enough. As I got closer, she picked up her pace, until I was coming for her. She took some of it in her mouth, and let the rest splash against my skin. Wendy got up on her hands and knees, kissing and licking my body, when she wasn't playing with my cock again. She seemed to be in heaven and I know I was. 

 Kelly came trotting into the room, and took up position opposite my wife. "Damn it! I missed the big finish? You couldn't wait?" 

 My wife laughed. "Sorry, but you're not too late to help clean up a little." 

 "Really? Cool!" she replied, joining Wendy in giving me a tongue bath. 

 Watching Wendy suck my cock, while Kelly licked around the base, was enough to start putting the steel back in my rod. Wendy pulled away, laughing. "No way, buddy. That was just to keep you sane. We're going to eat now, and we've got some more talking and planning to do. I promise you'll get another treat later." 

 That was fine by me. "That was pretty incredible." 

 Wendy climbed up and kissed me. "The best?" 

 "That's cheating. You were listening, weren't you?" 

 She nodded exuberantly. "Absolutely. Did you mean it? Really? 'Cause I saw her, and she was awfully good." 

 "You've always been the best, love. Always." 

 "You too. Nobody compares to you, I swear. I was such a God-damned fucking idiot, but it'll never happen again. You own my mouth now, nobody else." 

 Kelly was still playing below the belt. I was hard and it wasn't going away, not with what she was doing. She didn't take me in her mouth, but the shaft was getting plenty of attention. 

 My wife gave me a kiss, then climbed off the bed and smacked our new friend on her bare butt. "Enough, you little tease. Dinner's calling." 

 Kelly placed one last wet kiss on the head of my cock, and stood up. She gave Wendy a naked hug. "Thanks for sharing. That was pretty epic to watch. Damn, you have his number." 

 "A shit-load of practice, even if I've been slacking a bit in the last few weeks. Watching you was an education," she admitted. 

 Kelly gave her a quick kiss on the lips, not helping with my efforts to lose my erection. She let go and grabbed Wendy's hand. "Let's go. He ordered us a feast. All the best, too. If you don't hang onto him, I'm going to have to kick your ass." 

 Wendy was grinning, looking back at me as I pulled my shorts on, commando. "If I don't hang onto him, you're going to have to get in line to kick my ass, behind me." 

 It was still hard to reconcile the difference in their attitudes to each other, but I wasn't complaining. Everyone seemed happy, and the house was more joyous than it had been in a while. 

 Kelly had laid out plates and chopsticks at the kitchen table, and placed a bottle of wine in the middle. We all dug in, sharing and tasting everything. There were even a few tug-of-war battles for the last scallops and pieces of lobster in a couple of the dishes. 

 About halfway through, Wendy pushed back from the table and took off her shirt and bra. "I'll be damned if I'm going to be the only one not going topless," she laughed. "Besides, I think it's the only place I have an advantage over our house-guest." 

 Kelly laughed. "Like anyone's going to believe that! You're beautiful, and I'm maybe cute, if you cross your eyes and it's dark enough. And that body! Shit, woman, you've got it all." 

 Wendy grinned. "You've got it all too, except it's younger and tighter." 

 "Enough," I told them. "It's no competition. No offense to you, Kelly, you're sexy as hell, but Wendy is the most beautiful woman I've ever known." 

 "None taken. I'm gonna have to agree. I've never done a girl, but if I was gonna start, I know who I'd like my first to be." 

 Wendy blushed, and it was adorable. 

 We ate until we were stuffed, and polished off most of the bottle. The girls put away the leftovers, and there were still a lot. When I tried to help, I was shooed out of the kitchen. 

 I retired to my La-Z-boy, and turned on the evening game. I couldn't remember the last time I'd watched two games in one day, never mind three. 

 The girls were laughing together as they came into the room, then started running toward me, pushing at each other playfully to see who could get to me first. Wendy won, but I'm pretty sure Kelly let her. 

 My wife jumped in my lap, straddling me, and pressed her breasts to my face, laughing lustily. "God, I love you so much John. We haven't been playing enough. Spank me if I ever forget to let you know what you do to me." 

 I motor-boated her tits, keeping the laughing going. "You're right, as usual. We don't laugh enough anymore." 

 She leaned down and kissed me. "I'm going to make it better, lover. I promise." 

 "You've made a hell of a start." 

 Kelly got tired of waiting and plopped her adorable little butt on the arm of the chair, nudging Wendy's shoulder with hers. "Stop hogging the hottie! You've got a lifetime to play with him. I'm down to my last few hours." 

 Wendy gave me a quick kiss, and I saw her grinning mischievously. I knew she was up to something. She got off my lap and practically ran away, giggling, while Kelly took her place. 

 Kelly kissed me. "You know, you're even handsomer when you're happy. You should smile more." 

 "Hard not to, when you two are around." 

 She leaned forward and I wrapped my arms around her. "That certainly wasn't true yesterday. You realize you guys were meant for each other, and you'll be miserable without her? You sure as shit better make this work out." 

 "I know we will, and in no small part thanks to you." 

 I hadn't been paying enough attention, and my wife climbed onto my lap behind Kelly. 

 "What have you been up to, Trouble?" I asked her. 

 She giggled, and I watched her hands wrap around Kelly's body, grabbing the girl's tits. I was shocked. She pulled her hands away, and I saw she'd left a mess behind. It looked like peanut butter. 

 "Hey!" Kelly laughed. "What's that about?" 

 "Now we have a Peanut Butter and Kelly sandwich!" 

 Kelly and I both groaned at the awful pun. 

 "What? You know it's funny." My wife pouted. 

 "You made a mess," I told her. 

 "Then I guess you're going to have to clean her up. Get working, lazybones." She leaned backward, pulling Kelly with her, holding the girls tits out toward me. I lowered my head and made a big deal out of cleaning the peanut butter off of her skin, and off Wendy's hands and fingers. 

 It was fun, sexy, and stupidly erotic. After a couple of minutes you could feel the change in atmosphere. I was sucking on Kelly's hard little nipple, and Wendy was playing with the opposite one. Our guest was sighing and moaning softly. 

 I switched tits, and so did Wendy. 

 Kelly just moaned, "God, that's nice." 

 I pulled my mouth away, with only a little regret. "There, I think she's all clean." 

 Kelly pouted. "No, I'm a dirty girl!" 

 Wendy shook the tit she was holding, "I think you missed a spot here." 

 I leaned down and gave her another suck, then watched Wendy smear some more peanut butter on Kelly's hard nipple. 

 "Uh-uh. You're just going to have to take care of that yourself. Now get going before I get carried away." 

 I was rewarded with a last kiss from each of them, and they left me achingly hard, watching my football game. 

 It wasn't ten minutes later when the front door opened, and my mother-in-law walked in. I got up and walked toward her, thankful that the evidence of the girls' playfulness had subsided in my shorts. "Hi Mom," I greeted her. 

 She smiled at me, which was nice. She could be prickly. She walked right up and gave me a hug. "I'm sorry I was rude to you on the phone. I was upset, and you know how I get." 

 I hugged her back. "I know. I only called you as a last resort." 

 She almost knocked my socks off, if I'd been wearing any, when she pulled my head down and planted a kiss on my lips. "Thank you. I know it must be painful, what she did. A lot of men wouldn't be handling it as well as you. Hell, I know I wouldn't. You're a good man, John." 

 "Uh...you're welcome?" 

 She laughed. "Jeannie's at the house with Ed. Where are my girls?" 

 "In the bedroom." 

 She gave me a funny look. "Is she really a street-walker?" 

 I nodded. "Yeah, but not like any street-walker I ever heard of." 

 Carol laughed. "No, I guess not. I'm going to go back and join them. You hang in there." She walked away, then turned after she'd taken only a few steps. "About Alice, we'll deal with her. You don't have to worry about that. Leave her to me." 

 "Thanks, Mom." 

 She grinned, then walked back to me, giving me another big hug. "I've got a confession. Sometimes I thought you were awfully familiar, calling me Mom. Kind of disrespectful, even. Just now it gave me goosebumps. If I had a son, I couldn't hope for one any better than you, John. Thank you." 

 I laughed. "If it's time for confessions, I have to admit there's been a few times that the word out of my lips was Mom, but the names I was thinking were not nearly as nice." 

 She laughed, smacking my rear. "I hope so. Believe me, there's been times I've earned much different names. In the future, I hope you call me on it." 

 She turned, and I couldn't help myself and smacked her on the rear as she departed. She did a little hop, yelped and giggled. "Fresh! I'm going to chalk that one up to the rotten things you've got tucked away in back." 

 "It might just be that sexy rear. You know how they say a guy can look at his wife's mother and see what she's going to be like in 20 years? First time I saw you, I couldn't tell you how happy I was." 

 She laughed, "Why John! Are you flirting with me?" 

 "Calling it how I see it, gorgeous. Ed's a lucky man." 

 "That he is. I don't want you boys comparing notes over a beer, now. You're not supposed to know just how lucky." 

 I didn't see hide nor hair of them for at least three hours, except for one brief appearance when Kelly walked past on the way to the kitchen. She had my t-shirt back on. She had an open bottle of wine in her hand, when she returned. She stopped by my lap for a brief visit, and a little kissing action. "Sorry we're taking so long. Your wife wanted me to tell you she promised she'd make it up to you." 

 "No problem. You guys having fun?" 

 She wore a sad little smile. "It's not all fun and games. Not by a long shot, but she's determined not to show it. There're still issues to work out, but Carol's a Godsend. You were right about calling her in." 

 "Second best decision I made in the last 24 hours." 

 She grinned and kissed me. "What was the best?" 

 "You know," I told her. 

 She peeled her shirt off. "Yes, but I want to hear it. Indulge me." 

 "You were, of course. Not only because that wonderful mouth of yours is so damned talented." 

 "It is, isn't it? The second best blowjob you'll ever receive." 

 "No shit. Thank you." 

 "For the blowjobs?" she teased. 

 "For everything. You're the best, Angel." 

 "Except at blowjobs. Am I still going to get my tip?" 

 "You know it. Now get going before Carol comes looking for you, and I'm back in the doghouse." 

 She got up, leaned over and kissed me. "Silly boy. She'd be jealous. I think Mom's got a thing for you." 

 "Don't be silly." 

 "Say what you will. She's singing your praises," she said, holding her shirt in one hand, and the bottle in the other. 

 "Put on that shirt!" I called out after her. She only laughed. 

 It was almost midnight when Wendy and her Mom came out of the back. They were teary eyed, and hugged each other at the door. I went over to say goodbye, and Carol gave me a hug and a kiss, her lips lingering longer than a mother-in- law's were supposed to. "Don't you dare lose him," Carol warned her daughter. 

 "I know. You'll have to get in line behind Kelly and me, to kick my ass if I do." 

 Carol laughed. "It'll be a lot longer than that, trust me. The only line longer will be the one to take him off your hands." 

 Once she was out the door, Wendy slipped into my arms. "We've neglected you far too much today. Shut everything down and come to bed, husband." 

 I gave her a warm kiss. "You don't have to ask me twice." 

 It took me a couple of minutes, but not much more than that. The bed sheets were turned down for me, and my wife was waiting under them. As I slid in beside her, Kelly came out of the bathroom. I could hear the water for a bath running. 

 She sat down on the corner of the bed, back in her birthday suit. "I was going to catch a cab, and try my luck tonight, but it's late and I think I had a little too much to drink. Would it be Ok if I stayed the night? No charge." She looked a little nervous. 

 Wendy had my hand in hers and gave me a squeeze. I had no idea what that was supposed to mean. "Of course. Relax, take it easy. I'll give you a ride in the morning if you'd like," I told her. 

 "Thank you," is all she said, before returning to the bathroom and the tub. 

 Wendy was in my arms, almost as fast as Kelly was out of sight. She was as naked as I was. "Make love to me, John? Please?"  

 

 

===

Between the teasing, a naked horny wife, and an equally naked young whore in my bathroom, I was ready to do just that. I rolled over on top of her and between her legs before the words were out of her mouth. 

 She guided me home, and she was as wet as she'd ever been. I leaned over her, stroking into her slowly and steadily, as she left little kisses all over my face. She smiled. "Have I told you how much I love you lately?" 

 "Yes, but I never get tired of hearing it." 

 "You fit me perfectly, don't you? Do you think you'll ever get tired of me? Tired of sleeping with the same woman for the rest of your life?" 

 I kissed her lips, and plunged in deep, forcing a little grunt out of her. I stayed there, buried inside of her. "Never. It's a dream come true." 

 She smiled. "Did you really tell Mom you checked her out, to see what I'd be like 20 years from now?" 

 I thrust in her again, hard, making her grunt. "You girls talk too much." 

 "Is that a yes?" 

 "Maybe. Am I in trouble now?" 

 She teasingly thrust up against me, "Silly. Of course not. The first time you saw her you were thinking of being with me 20 years later. Every damn thing you do makes me love you more. Can you ever forgive me for letting you down?" 

 "I told you. You were forgiven almost as soon as it happened. Do you understand now why I was so upset?" 

 "Completely. You had every right to be. It's a miracle you even let me back in the door. I cheated on you, over and over again, and hid it from you. I disrespected you, and embarrassed you in front of our friends. I put a terrible strain on our marriage. I'm not going to apologize again for it, the words aren't enough. But I will make it up to you, and I will do my damnedest to make things right." 

 "We'll do that together," I whispered, my lips brushing hers, our bodies undulating together, in a perfect, familiar rhythm. 

 "No, I'll do it. If you're not happy with the results, then we'll see. Please let me try first, I need to do this." 

 "Go ahead then. I'll be here if you need my help." I didn't tell her that no matter what she did, I'd probably seek out my own retaliation. 

 She sighed, relaxing, thrusting back against me as I continued to make love to her. "You like this better than the blowjobs, don't you?" she whispered after a while. 

 I paused in mid-stroke. "Of course. A blowjob is too one-sided. I love the pleasure you give me with your sweet, sexy mouth, but this, what we're doing now, is incredible. I'll never get enough of it." 

 She grinned. "We'll see about that. I'm going to fuck you silly, dear husband. All the fucking and blowjobs a man could ever ask for." 

 I held my face above hers, staring into her eyes, trying to let her see what I felt for her. We made love slowly, intimately. She finally tilted her head back, closing her eyes. "Yes, yes, yes," she chanted softly with each stroke, interrupted every so often with a high-pitched "Ohmygod!" 

 It was unusual for her. She normally only got like that after an extended period of hard fucking. When we were making slow, quiet love, her excitement and orgasms were quieter. 

 I thrust a little more firmly, but I didn't want to change things when she was already on her way. She was starting to tremble, no longer vocal, her face strained, her neck taut. She was groaning a little 'Oh' with each new stroke, her fingers digging into my arms. 

 She snapped, screaming loudly as she came for me, as powerfully as she ever had before, shaking. I kept fucking her steadily and she cried out again, staring up at me, her eyes looking almost fearful. 

 "GET A ROOM, YOU TWO!" Kelly shouted out from the bathroom, laughing. 

 "Come for me," Wendy gasped. "Fill me, take me, love me." 

 I was getting close, and I kissed her briefly, before closing my eyes and losing myself in the sensation. I slowed down, experiencing every thrust, every connection, as if each new one was my first. I had almost stopped, slowly penetrating her, pulling back completely, then opening her again, completing us. I was quiet as I pushed all the way in, one last time, and only when I could go no further, I surrendered and filled her with my hot seed. 

 I could feel her pussy squeezing my cock, pulsing, as she screamed out, before falling back limp. I felt a weight on the bed, and looked over to see Kelly wrapped in a towel. She leaned over and brushed Wendy's hair back from her face. "Looks like someone enjoyed that." 

 Wendy had tears in her eyes. "How can you love me so much, after what I did?" she asked piteously. 

 "How could I not love you? You're my soul mate." 

 I started to pull out of her, and she clung to me. "Not yet. Please, stay in me a little longer." She pulled me down. I knew what she wanted. The years together ensured that. Sometimes she liked to feel my weight on her, pinning her down. I took some of the weight off my arms, and rested on her, feeling her breathing change. 

 "Don't leave me, John. Never leave me." 

 I kissed her face. "Now you're being silly. You're mine. Always." 

 Kelly dropped her towel, and crawled in next to us. "I know I'm being selfish, but can I lay here with you two for just a moment? Please? I've never been around love like yours." 

 Wendy looked at her, reached an arm out and pulled her close. She didn't say anything, and neither did I as I lifted an arm and put it around her as well. 

 Kelly buried her head in Wendy's shoulder, and I felt her trembling. She abruptly pulled away. "I...I have to go." 

 Wendy held her. "Don't, stay a moment." 

 Kelly seemed almost to panic. "No. Please. I can't. I need to go." She scrambled off the bed, and almost ran out of the room. 

 I rolled off of Wendy, onto my back, and she turned to me, holding me tightly. "We have to help her, John. She can't go back on the street. She's not a whore." 

 "What can we do? She's an adult." 

 "Did she tell you her story?" 

 "No. She wouldn't. I tried to get her to open up a couple of times." 

 "God, it's horrible. Tragedies, compounded with some stupid decisions. She's drowning. It's a terrible, heart-breaking thing. We have to help her. We have to. If we don't, and we come out of this intact, I'll hate myself." 

 "What do you want to do?" 

 "I don't know yet, but right now, I want her back in our bed, and I need her to know she's loved. Bring her back to me, John." 

 I kissed her softly. "Have I ever been able to deny you anything?" 

 She smiled. "No. I want this as much as I've wanted anything in my life. Please?" 

 "Your wish is my command, dear wife." 

 I found Kelly on the couch, curled up under an afghan. She was crying. I sat down beside her and stroked her hair. "I'm taking you back to our bed." 

 She shook her head. "I shouldn't." 

 I scooped her into my arms, lifting her easily. "My wife will never forgive me if I don't. Who would ever believe she'd want someone like you in my bed?" 

 "A whore like me?" she said sadly. 

 "No, a beautiful caring young woman like you. Naked," I teased. 

 "You're just making it more difficult," she whispered. 

 "That's the last thing I want to do," I told her. "I want you to be happy." 

 She shook her head. "I don't deserve to be happy," she muttered. 

 "Stop talking nonsense. Everyone deserves to be happy. A wonderful young girl like you, more than most." 

 She shook her head again, as I carried her through the door of my bedroom. Wendy pulled back the covers beside her, in the center of the bed, and I deposited the little naked bundle of angst there. I killed the lights, and climbed in next to her. 

 For the next half hour or so, all we did was hold her, pet her, and kiss her. It wasn't overtly sexual, more comforting, loving, and cuddling. 

 My wife spoke to me softly. "Are you going to work tomorrow?" 

 "I need to. Things that I have to do, and a customer call I have to make. I'm not looking forward to it. If either of the bastards who were at that party say a word cross-wise to me, I'll probably have to kick their asses, and let the chips fall where they may." 

 "Don't do that, John! Please, not in the office. Let me try to handle it first." 

 Kelly was silent, one of her hands touching my body, running softly along my side. I had a hand on her breast, cupping it gently. 

 "With luck, I won't have to. There were only the two of them, and I don't normally see them every day." 

 "Maybe they don't know." 

 "I'm pretty sure at least Paul does. He was in the group talking to Tom, when I found out what you'd done, and Tom was laughing when I dragged you out of there. Before we got out the door, all of them were." 

 "You think Tom would actually talk about it? He promised he'd keep it a secret." 

 "How did Jarrod end up getting a blowjob that night?" I asked her, pretty sure I knew the answer. 

 She got quiet. "God, I really fucked up bad, didn't I?" 

 Kelly kissed her. "Shhh. You did. It is what it is. Now we make it better, remember?" 

 I leaned across Kelly, and kissed my wife. "Don't worry about it. It won't happen again. We move forward now." 

 As long as I was over Kelly, I leaned down and gave her a nice long kiss. "I'm tired now. It's been a long weekend. Why don't we all get some sleep." 

 "I don't want to be between you and your wife," Kelly whispered. "It feels wrong. Switch places with me?" 

 We did, and I drifted off, two lovely naked women leaning into me, my arms around both. I couldn't think of a better way to fall asleep. 

 * * * 

 I woke alone, which was a little disappointing. I kind of liked getting woken up with a blowjob, and I had a hard-on that looked like it was going to go to waste. 

 Hitting the bathroom, I cleaned up for the day, in a bit of a hurry, since the alarm hadn't gone off and I was running almost an hour late. My office wasn't a stickler for hours, but I liked getting in early, to see when the others arrived. I guess one day wasn't going to kill me. 

 The girls were finishing making breakfast, which was usually a very simple meal for me. They were both dressed in my t-shirts, and I had to confess, they looked better in them than I ever would. 

 Wendy turned and met me, hugging me and giving me a kiss. "I was going to give you a little morning treat, but when I went to look for you, you were already in the shower." 

 "You're always welcome to join me," I told her with a kiss. We didn't do stuff like that very often, at least not in the last few years. 

 She pouted. "I'm such a dope. I didn't even think of it. You wouldn't mind?" 

 "Mind? Never. I love bathing with you." 

 She grinned. "Good. We'll be doing a lot more of that, too. Save some water." 

 Kelly walked over and gave me a quick kiss. "Good morning, handsome. Thank you for last night. That might have been the best night's sleep I ever had." 

 She grabbed a couple of plates and took them to the table. 

 "Tell her she can't go, John. She can't leave today. I need her help, still. Please." 

 I laughed. "You can't leave, Kelly. Sorry. The old ball-and-chain has spoken. I need your services still." 

 Kelly wasn't laughing. "No you don't. You have your wife for that now." 

 "Please. She wants you here, and I want you here. Do you have to go?" I asked. 

 "John, every minute I stay makes it more difficult. I don't want to get in the way of you and Wendy getting back together." 

 Wendy was finishing getting the breakfast on the table. "You're not. If anything, you make us better. Please?" 

 I went over to Kelly, who was seated, and put my hands on her shoulders, massaging them gently. "Think it over. We both want you here." I kissed her on the cheek, and took my seat. 

 The girls were very hush-hush about what they were up to, but they were talking about Wendy's and my early days together, and seemed to be in a good mood. I didn't linger over breakfast, finishing up, and getting ready to leave. I gave Wendy a kiss. "Thanks for breakfast. This was nice." 

 She grinned, pulling me back for a more serious kiss. When she was done with me she said, "Kelly helped a lot. She's good in the kitchen. You should thank her as well." 

 Yep. My wife was full of surprises. 

 I went over to Kelly and leaned down for a kiss. It was nice, soft and lingering, just a little tongue. "Thank you for everything, Angel." 

 She smiled. "You're welcome. Now go make us some money." 

 I laughed, and headed out to face the day, with more than a little trepidation. 

 * * * 

 The office turned out not to be a problem, at least not that Monday. Work was work. Too many emails and conference calls, project reviews and decisions, and my normal engineering visits to see how things were going, the typical Management-by-walking-around. As a director, I wasn't as involved in the day- to-day operations of the projects as I had been a couple of years earlier, but I still liked to keep my fingers in it. 

 I did take a lunch break and hit the bank. My lady of the evening had earned her pay, and it was more than I could get out of the ATM. 

 I thought about my situation at home, and was more than a little curious about what Wendy was up to. I also had my reservations over what she wanted to do about Kelly. I'd like to help the girl, I would. But not at the expense of my marriage, and I was thinking she might be trouble. You don't end up in her place at 18 without having some serious issues. 

 In the back of my mind, I was still playing with the idea of what to do about the three assholes, Tom in particular. He'd started it, the fucking instigator, and he'd have to pay. Big time. No two ways about it. 

 I imagine there are those who think it wasn't his fault, no big deal. I wasn't married to him, and guys were guys. My wife was the one who'd strayed. 

 Sorry. I'm not wired that way. Guys who chase married women are complete and total asswipes. When they do it to their friends, whatever they've got coming to them is only just desserts. The fucker was married, with a wonderful loving wife, two kids, and a great job. He had no business chasing after mine. 

 On the drive home, I let a couple of possible solutions percolate in my thoughts, until I had a fairly good idea of how I'd at least start my revenge. 

 * * * 

 When I walked in, the girls were sitting in the family room arguing. It didn't sound angry, just a disagreement. I didn't get to hear much of it, they shut up when I entered the house. 

 They both got up, and met me in the hallway. Kelly got to me first. "Well if it isn't the protector and provider, back home after a long day in the trenches." She offered her lips up for a kiss, and I accepted. 

 My wife moved into my arms, claiming a better one. "Go dress down, and join us. We did some shopping today. I think you'll like it." 

 I got out of my suit, and made myself comfortable. When I arrived back in the family room, it was empty. 

 "Wendy?" I called out. 

 "Just a moment, love. I'll be right there." 

 She walked out a few seconds later, wearing a sexy black lace babydoll, with a beer in her hand. "I used the credit-card today, I hope you're not angry." 

 I laughed. "Dressing like that is how you should approach me every time you do something I may not like. It's hard to get angry at you, when all the blood from my head is below my waist." 

 Kelly walked in, with a tray of snacks, wearing a white version of the same outfit. She looked fabulous. "Wow. That's a hell of a combination you two have going," I observed. 

 Wendy rubbed up against me. "You like it? You're not mad?" 

 "Hell no. Buying lingerie will never get me mad." 

 She laughed. "Remember you said that! Drink up, we'll be right back." 

 It was a couple of minutes later when they returned, wearing nothing but matching sexy bras and panties. This time my wife was in red, and Kelly was in pink. They both had on heels, matching red for my wife, and white for Kelly. "I decided I don't dress sexy for you often enough," Wendy started. "This is for when we go out. I bought two more sets which will remain a surprise. Still not angry I hope. We did spend kind of a lot." 

 The truth was I made good money. We could afford it. I'd been with the same company for seven years, and I'd grown with them. We'd only had six people when I started there, and I was an intern. We had more than 100 now. I had stock options, and they'd started vesting two years earlier. We weren't wealthy, but a few thousand didn't hurt us at all. 

 "Worth every penny," I told her honestly. 

 She smiled, turning slowly. "The shoes are new, too," she said nervously. 

 I laughed. "Wendy, you don't spend enough on yourself. I don't mind, and we can afford it. Treat yourself now and then." 

 "The shoes were more than $150," she confessed. 

 "I don't care if they cost a thousand. They're gorgeous on you." 

 She pouted. "We might have spent more than a thousand." 

 "Come here, honey," I said, opening my arms. 

 She came over and sat in my lap. "I didn't mean to get carried away, but we were having such a good time," she said softly. 

 I hugged her. "I love you. What's mine is yours. So we might spend a little less on our next vacation. It's not going to be a problem. We'll still be able to pay our bills." 

 The baby monitor on the table next to me went off, and I could hear fussing, that shortly became crying. Wendy hopped up. "Your baby's up. I'll get her." 

 She climbed out of my lap, and took off in those cute heels. Kelly took her place in my lap. "I'm sorry we bought so much. She went kind of crazy. I'll pay you back," she said nervously. 

 "No you won't. Consider it part of the tip." 

 She nodded. "Why are you both so good to me?" 

 "We love you, silly girl. You did a good thing this weekend. You may have saved our marriage." 

 "You both would have gotten back together. It was pretty obvious. The way you feel about each other." 

 I pulled her in close, hugging her, while I heard Wendy talking to our little girl over the monitor, cooing over her. It sounded like she was changing her diaper. 

 "Maybe. I did a dangerous thing, and you could have made it worse. You decided to help instead. That was a very kind and generous gesture. I hope you understand that, and what it means to both of us." 

 She leaned against me. "I need to leave soon. I...I can't stand being here much longer." 

 Her words hurt me. Shocked me. "You can't stand being here?" 

 She shook her head. "No. Every moment I'm here, every time I see you two together, it hurts. It's going to make it that much more difficult to go back to doing what I have to do." 

 "What exactly do you have to do?" 

 "You know. I have to take care of myself, and I have no education and no skills. I've got to keep a roof over my head, and eat." 

 I lifted her up a little, so I could reach into my pocket. I pulled out the bank envelope and passed it to her. "For the weekend." I pulled out a second envelope, and handed it over. "For the rest of the week. You shouldn't have to worry about a roof and eating for at least a few days." 

 She looked in the envelope. "There...there's a lot of money in here." 

 "You earned it." 

 "How much?" she asked, counting through the bills. 

 "A thousand. Another thousand if you'll stay the rest of the week." 

 She closed the envelope. "No, it's too much." 

 I laughed. "You're not very good at the business side of things are you? We're definitely going to have to work on that. You should have asked for more." I pulled out a last envelope, and put it in her hands. "Two-hundred a night, remember? That's $1000 for five days. But I'm buying your days, too. An extra hundred a day." 

 Her eyes misted up. "Why?" 

 "Do I have to go over that again? Because I want to, and I can. That should be reason enough." 

 She scrambled out of my lap, when Wendy returned with Jeannie in her arms. My wife put my daughter in my arms, and I looked down at her happy smiling face. I loved putting my finger in her hand, and watching her grab it. She was getting stronger, and had a nice little grip.  

 

 

===

I kissed her head, smelling her fresh skin. That irresistible baby smell. "How's my little Angel doing?" I whispered. 

 I looked over, and Wendy was removing her new bra. She saw me watching, and smiled. "Sorry lover. Your daughter's hungry, and it's feeding time. She has first claim to these for a few more months." 

 Kelly stood near my chair, watching me with my girl. She shifted her weight nervously. "Can...can I hold her?" 

 I lifted my girl and gave her another kiss on the forehead, then held her out to Kelly who leaned over and took her. She held her in her arm, rocking her. "She's beautiful," she whispered. 

 I laughed. "Of course. You've seen her mother." 

 She walked over and gave her to my wife, who adjusted her into position, then moved her nipple to Jeannie's hungry mouth. I looked up and saw a dark cloud pass over Kelly's face. My wife seemed to notice as well. She looked upset. "What's wrong?" 

 Kelly shook her head, "Nothing." 

 "That's not true. Something's upset you. You can tell me," Wendy argued. 

 Kelly shook her head, "It's no big deal." 

 Wendy wouldn't let it go. "After all we've talked about? Go ahead." 

 Kelly crossed her arms, staring at my wife. "I get angry, Ok? I look at that little girl, and everything you have. The way your husband treats you, and I just get so pissed off that you'd take a chance on throwing it all away for some stupid bastards. If you only knew how good you had it. Try living on the street for a while. God, how could you!" 

 Kelly turned and ran from the room, crying, and I looked over at my wife who appeared in shock. 

 "She didn't mean it," I told her softly. 

 Tears welled up in Wendy's eyes, and started rolling down her cheeks. "Yes she did, and she's right. I almost lost everything. I don't even know why. I...I..." 

 "Shh. You didn't. That's what matters now. That, and our family." 

 She nodded, wiping her tears with the back of one hand. "I'll make you proud of me again. You won't be sorry." 

 I got up and leaned over my wife, holding her head to my chest. "I'm always proud of you, and I'll never be sorry as long as you're by my side." 

 "I don't deserve you," she sobbed. 

 "We deserve each other. We're fortunate to have each other. Most people don't get lucky enough to meet and fall in love with their soul mates. We have the best marriage I know of. I don't want to hear you say that again. We wouldn't be where we are today, if not for you." 

 I looked up and Kelly walked into the room, dressed like she was when I first met her. She had a bag in her hand. She put two of the envelopes in front of me. "I'm sorry. I can't do this. I hope you two have a great life together. I called a cab and I'll wait out front." 

 I was stunned and she walked to the door before I could get a word in. 

 "Don't let her go, John! You have to stop her," Wendy begged me. 

 "I can't. She's an adult. I can't make her stay." 

 "Please. You have to try. She won't survive out there. She won't, I know it. Something terrible will happen. Can you live with that? I can't." 

 I couldn't stop her, but I could perhaps talk to her. "I'll see what I can do," I told my wife, then ran after Kelly. 

 She was sitting on the front stoop, curled up in a ball, the bag in front of her. 

 "Come back in. At the least I can drive you wherever you need to go." 

 "I already called the taxi," she said. 

 "It'll take at least ten minutes to get here. Wendy will pay him. Come back inside, and let me drive you, please?" 

 She was quiet, then nodded, standing slowly. I opened the door for her. 

 She walked in slowly, then turned back to the family room. She walked up to Wendy. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said what I did. We both know it wasn't like that." 

 Wendy nodded slowly. "It's Ok. It's mostly true. I didn't think I was cheating, but I should have known better, and I did do it. I risked it all. It was a foolish, terrible thing to do." 

 "Thank you for everything," Kelly responded. "You didn't have to treat me so nice. It was wonderful seeing you guys together, happy. I'll remember this for a long, long time. I kind of forgot people can be like you guys." 

 "Do you have to go?" Wendy pleaded. 

 "Yes. I'm sorry." She leaned down and kissed Wendy on the cheek, then gave Jeannie a kiss on the top of her head. 

 "You two have to work it out. If only for her sake, Ok? Never hurt her." 

 Wendy nodded, and started crying again. 

 Kelly turned back and walked through the kitchen, to the garage door. 

 I grabbed my keys off the hook in the kitchen, and followed her. 

 * * * 

 We were quiet for the first few minutes. She didn't look like she wanted to talk, and I wasn't going to force things. 

 When I was back on Georgia Ave, headed south, I asked, "Where am I taking you?" 

 She was slow to answer. "It's only a few blocks from where you picked me up, if you don't mind." 

 "No problem." 

 I left her alone with her thoughts a little longer, before I had to speak up. "You won't change your mind? We would like you to stay." 

 She shook her head. "You're a great guy, John. But I can't. It's just not right." 

 I tried. I tried to talk her into returning with me, how it would be good for Wendy, that I wanted her there, that she could still go back in a week, with a little more money. She didn't argue, she simply said no. 

 When I pulled up to the decrepit building, she did turn to me. "You're the best man I've met in years, John. Thank you. I do hope everything works out for you and Wendy." 

 "Thank you." I grabbed her hand, and put the other two envelopes in it. "Take it. I won't accept no for an answer. I want you to have it, and I hope it makes your life a little easier." 

 "I can't..." she started. 

 "You can, and you will. No argument. Pay your rent ahead, get a nice outfit, find a real job. Whatever. This will help." 

 She nodded, taking the envelopes and tucking them into her little clutch. 

 I pulled out my wallet and gave her my business card. "If you ever need anything, anything at all, give me a call. If you want to just visit, our door is open to you. At least call Wendy and let her know how you're doing, she's really worried about you." 

 She tucked the card into her bra, then turned and threw her arms around my neck. "Love your baby girl, John. Love her always. Let her know what she means to you. Watch over her and take care of her." She kissed my cheek, and scrambled out of the door, before I could answer. 

 I pulled away slowly, waving, hoping beyond hope, that things would get better for her. I doubted it, but I could hope.

======================== 

 Stray blowjobs have consequences, all around. 

 ======================== 

 The ride home after dropping off Kelly, my little lost lady-of-the-night, was sad. I knew my wife would be upset. 

 I pulled into the garage and entered the house through the kitchen. Wendy was standing there, dressed to the nines, and she looked at me hopefully. I shook my head, and she nodded sadly. 

 "You look nice," I said. A little too nice. Like it was date night. I wondered if she was wearing her new bra and panty set. "We goin' somewhere?" 

 She smiled. "I need to go out for a while. It's part of making things better. I'm going to ask you to please trust me, even though I don't deserve it." 

 After the stunt she'd pulled she was asking a lot. I saw her watching me anxiously. Could I trust her? Did I believe her? It only took me a few seconds to realize if I didn't, I might as well walk away myself. If she was going to screw around, there was no way I could stop it. It was up to her. 

 I took her in my arms. "I'm not going to worry about what you do. I trust you completely. I refuse to look over your shoulder the rest of your life. I'm sure you understand the consequences if you were to stray again. For whatever reason." 

 She nodded. "Thank you. I promise you won't regret it." 

 She left half-an-hour later. I grabbed a beer, and parked myself in front of the TV. Monday night football. Four games in one weekend. I laughed to myself, wondering if it would ever happen again. I wouldn't mind if it never did, in spite of two damn good games the day before, I was all football'd out. 

 I had Jeannie in her playpen, and had to watch over her, but it's not like that was a chore. I kept thinking back to what Kelly had said, and what had happened to her, for her to be in the situation she was. 

 My idle thoughts wandered between whatever my wife was up to, what Kelly was doing, and how I was going to get revenge on the assholes. For the last, I wasn't looking for anything too complicated. 

 I took a few moments out to place some orders over the internet, supplies for some of my possible solutions. Then half-time was over, and I was back to watching the game. 

 Wendy came home at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and she looked happy. Almost too happy. 

 "How'd things go?" I asked, curious if she would finally tell me. 

 "It went well. I'm going to need a few more days, and then I'll explain everything. How's the game?" 

 "Not bad," I told her. 

 "Oh. I was hoping it was boring, and you might consider letting me entertain you instead." 

 I grinned. "I believe I could be talked into that." 

 She grabbed Jeannie out of the pen. "Let me feed her, and put her down for the night. Then we can let the entertainment begin." 

 We made it halfway through the fourth, before she got up. "Give me a few minutes, then you can join me in the bedroom." 

 I watched a couple of more plays, but the game was pretty much over by then. I turned off the TV, and checked the doors and lights. 

 Wendy was waiting for me in one of her new outfits. She undressed me, then had me lay back in the bed. She moved between my legs, and started to go down on me, pretty aggressively, nothing like the long lovemaking I'd received the night before. 

 She got me nice and hard, and kept it up for a couple of minutes before she stood, smiling, and removed her delicate panties. She went to climb on me, and I took her in my arms, kissing her, then rolled her over onto her back, moving down her body. I was looking forward to returning the favor she'd so generously bestowed on me. 

 After only a couple of minutes, she was begging me to fuck her. "I love it baby, but I need you inside of me. Please," she moaned. 

 I was happy enough to oblige, and we had good old fashioned sex. Dirty and sweaty, in several positions. I got her off toward the end, and worked toward my own completion. When I couldn't take it any longer, I pulled out of her and scrambled up beside her head, stroking my cock. 

 She grabbed me, and sucked me into her mouth. I was a little surprised, she didn't normally like to suck me after I'd been inside of her, but she had no problem at that moment. She only got a few good sucks in before I was ready to blow. She held me in her mouth, stroking my cock as I delivered the goods. 

 She sucked gently afterward, then smiled and swallowed. "You didn't want to finish inside me?" 

 "I love to, but I know how much you like it in your hot little mouth." 

 She grinned. "You know me so well. How about in the future, you finish the first one in my mouth, and the second one inside me?" 

 I smiled, leaning over and kissing her. "Are you hinting you'd like to go again." 

 "Let me give you more than a hint," she said, and pushed me back, her mouth seeking out my missile. 

 This time we took it easier, and I made love to her, taking my time before I finished between her legs. She held me afterward. "I love this so much. Tasting your cum in my mouth, while feeling it inside my pussy." 

 I kissed her again, slowly and lovingly. "Imagine how good I feel," I told her. 

 "What would you say to making this a regular thing?" she asked. "One for each naughty mouth?" 

 "I believe I could live with that," I told her. 

 She got up and brought back a washcloth. I figured she'd clean both of us up, but she put it between her legs, and used her mouth on me. That was something new. I hate to admit it, but it was a little concerning. "I thought you didn't like that?" 

 "I was an idiot. I love the taste of your cum. You don't seem to mind the taste of me, and you know what? I guess I don't either. I love cleaning you after. I'm going to be doing a lot more of that, I promise. I hope you don't mind?" 

 I laughed. "Not in the least." 

 She gave me another little suck, then crawled up next to me. "Kelly and I talked about that. I never realized that I only suck you at the beginning of our sessions. I could have at least cleaned you up with a washcloth, and sucked you again. I know what we have is great, but I want it to be even better. Anything you want to try, anything you want to do, please ask me. I want to be everything for you. Never be embarrassed, or afraid. The worst I can say is I didn't like it much afterward." 

 "How about you? Anything you want to do?" 

 "I want to taste your cum every day for the rest of my life. You already know what I like most." 

 "I'll see what I can do to make you happy. Remember, the same applies. Anything you want to try, I'm happy to listen." 

 She hugged me, clinging to my side. "How come we never talked about this before?" 

 I shrugged. "Don't know. Didn't think we had to, I guess." 

 She nodded. "Me either. I'm happy with our sex life. I hope you are." 

 "I am. I love you. I think we got a little lost during and after the pregnancy. I'm sorry if that's what drove you to do what you did." 

 She shook her head. "No. I mean it might have been a small part of it, but it was more me just being stupid, and taking bad advice. I didn't really want it or need it. I gave in. I was drunk but that's a lousy excuse. I won't do that again. If I have any problem at all, I'll talk to you first. I promise." 

 "Me too." 

 We were quiet. I tried to sleep, but I kept seeing Kelly standing on a corner, leaning into strange cars. 

 "Are you thinking about her?" Wendy asked. 

 I didn't hesitate. "Yes. I hope she's alright." 

 "Me too." 

 * * * 

 For the next few days everything was pretty good. She went out again on Tuesday. She was spending a good bit of time on the phone. I asked her if Kelly had called, but she said no. I received my delivery from my online orders, and Wendy didn't ask me about it. She seemed to be giving me a little space. 

 At the same time, I was still concerned about us. She was keeping secrets in the evening, then seemed to be paying penance each night. She was fawning, and eager to do anything she could for me. 

 I wanted my Wendy back. Not a broken, terrified woman. I needed her to know that I loved her, and she didn't need to be constantly trying to make amends, making my favorite meals, cleaning up after me, offering me sex non-stop (Ok, she could keep doing that one), bringing me an after-work drink. 

 I left her a single rose. No reason. A little note in her purse telling her I'd been thinking of her. A bottle of my favorite perfume on her, just because. 

 Wendy was hot as a firecracker when she got home, and I was happy to indulge her. Three times, mouth, pussy and mouth again. She was wearing her grin when she fell asleep in my arms. 

 Wendy seemed happier than ever when she came home Thursday from her night out, and we made love again, as we had every day. I got to see a new outfit every night. Thursday the outfit didn't last long, and I was a little ashamed that I tore her panties in my eagerness. She giggled and assured me she didn't mind having to go shopping for new bottoms. She'd even buy spares. 

 It was almost 1:00 am when the phone rang. It woke me, and I was upset, wondering what would necessitate such a late call. I hoped everything was alright with our families. 

 I picked up the phone, "Hello?" 

 "John," a nervous voice responded. 

 "Kelly? Is that you? Are you alright?" I asked sitting up in the bed. 

 Wendy sat up looking at me nervously. 

 "I...I've been arrested. Can you bail me out? I'll pay you back." 

 "Where are you?" 

 She told me where she was, and that as a first time offender there was a $500 fine, and she'd have to face charges of up to 90 days in jail. 

 "I'll be there shortly. Don't say anything, don't sign anything. I'll be there as soon as I can." 

 "Ok. Thank you, I didn't know who else to call." 

 "You did right, Angel. Hold on, I'm coming for you." 

 I got up and started to get dressed. I headed off the questions I knew Wendy would have. "She got arrested. I'm going to go get her." 

 "Bring her home, John." 

 I nodded. "I will. I'll be back as soon as I can." 

 In the car, I got out my phone and called my lawyer and friend, Jim Friedland. When he got done chewing me out for waking him up at that ungodly hour, he gave me a number to call for a law-firm that specialized in solicitation. "Are you in jail?" he asked me. 

 "It's not me. It's a family friend." 

 "Understood. David's firm is very good. Good luck." 

 I hung up and made the second call. The person answering the phone assured me they could handle it. I pulled over and gave him a credit-card number over the phone. I told him how I'd been referred, and gave him Jim's name, and mentioned the partner whose name was among the firms'. He said they'd take care of it, and things should be in order by the time I got to the jail. 

 I didn't know how things worked, and should have been more concerned. Normally you'd have to stay in jail until arraignment, or pay a fine, and accept the charges, before facing the judge. By the time I got to where Kelly was, they'd already set up some Deferred Prosecution thing, as a first time offender. She'd be out with some drug testing, community service, a limitation on where she could go, and probation. 

 Kelly was a mess, and ran into my arms crying. 

 "It was horrible, John. Horrible." 

 "Shh. It'll be Ok. Come on, let's get you home." 

 She didn't say anything as I drove back toward my house, instead of her apartment or whatever she stayed in. I explained the terms of her release, and she thanked me repeatedly. 

 I didn't ask her how she'd gotten in trouble. She didn't offer an explanation. She asked me how Wendy and Jeannie were doing, and I opened up to her, telling her what was going on, about Wendy going out, and even about our love life. 

 "You trust her, don't you?" she asked. 

 "I do. At least I'm trying. I have to admit, I'm more than a little anxious. It's not easy." 

 "I know. If she's been out three times, it's probably almost over. You both are getting along?" 

 "Better than ever." I heard her stomach growling, and laughed. 

 She pouted. "It's not funny. It's almost 3:00am." 

 "I know. I'm going to stop at the 24-hour Burger King. I don't think we have enough at home to feed you, if you're anything like the last time." 

 She grinned. "No, I just don't like to eat before going out to work. There's a late-night McDonald's where I usually go afterward." 

 "Burger King's alright then?" 

 "Perfect." 

 She ate on the last part of the drive, and polished off a Whopper and fries before we got to the house. She laughed as we pulled up. "You always feed me so well. I would have gotten the kid's meal on my own." 

 "Nothing's too good for my girl," I teased as I closed the garage door behind us. 

 She suddenly seemed nervous, as we entered the house. "Come on. Wendy will want to see you. She talks about you every day. She's so worried." 

 "She shouldn't worry about me. I'm a big girl." 

 "We both worry about you. Come. A quick hello, and you can take a bath and hit the sack." 

 She walked with me into the bedroom, and Wendy was awake. She jumped up and hugged Kelly, until they both were crying. I lost them then, when they went into the bathroom together. 

 Jeannie was fussing, but we were still working on getting her to sleep through the night, so I let her. She didn't start a crying jag, which was good, that was always hard on me. I wanted to go to her at those times, but Wendy always reminded me I couldn't. I'd spent more than one night sitting outside her door, listening to her crying. I'd probably have cried myself, if I wasn't too damn manly for that kind of stuff. 

 The girls were taking their time, and I was surprised when I was being woken up and told to move over. I moved to the side of the bed, and Kelly was between us, naked in my bed again, with Wendy on her other side. 

 It was late, and I hugged her, putting my arm across her waist. "I'm glad you're home, Angel," I whispered, then kissed her on the cheek, before falling asleep. 

 * * * 

 I woke to a morning blowjob from my wife, while Kelly slept next to me, her arm thrown across my chest. A hell of a way to wake up. 

 Kelly woke up near the finish, and looked down. "Lucky girl," she whispered, before giggling. 

 "Lucky guy," I reminded her. 

 "Yes, you are. Sorry for the trouble." 

 I tilted her chin up and kissed her softly. I was beyond speaking, as Wendy decided it was time for me to come. The kiss became more intense, more passionate, as I came for my wife. It was a big one, and I shot off several times. She swallowed most of it, then pulled away, letting the rest spill onto my skin. 

 "Want to help?" she asked Kelly. "It's your damn fault there's so much," she said laughing. 

 Kelly pulled her lips away from mine, with a last playful swipe of her tongue. She scooted down the bed and accepted a naughty kiss from Wendy before she assisted with the cleaning. 

 I was surprised and quite pleased at the job they did. At one point they had both of their mouths on my shaft, as I firmed up for them. Wendy made a point of going down on me, until I was stiff again. 

 She sat up laughing. "Three times last night, and twice more this morning? What are you, 18 again?" 

 "No, just a very lucky man." 

 She grinned, and pulled on her robe, while Kelly kept kissing and licking. Wendy watched for a few seconds. "I'll leave you to take care of that one, while I fix breakfast," she said. 

 Kelly stopped. "Oh no, I can't," she said. 

 "You helped make it that way. The least you can do is deal with it. I'm worn out, trying to take care of the beast. I have a baby to feed, and a breakfast to make. You've got 15 minutes before he has to start getting ready." She left without waiting for an answer. 

 Kelly looked up at me hesitantly. "John?" 

 "Don't look at me. I wasn't expecting that," I laughed. 

 She looked down at my cock, and her hand slowly closed on it. "I shouldn't," she whispered. 

 "You should. Soon. Time's wasting." 

 She looked back at me, then got on her hands and knees. "Are you sure?" 

 "Please," I told her. 

 She did. It was different. She made love to my cock, much as Wendy had done the first time. She took her time, kissing my skin, my thighs, licking me all over. She sucked me, and swallowed my entire length, holding me in the back of her mouth, while she looked up at me. She had a little smile at the corner of her lips, while she pulled away. 

 She spent ten minutes teasing and torturing me, checking the clock regularly. Then she spent five minutes showing off her skills, and had me erupting between her lips at the 15 minute mark. 

 She smiled, her mouth full, and nodded to the clock. Then she got up without a word and walked out of the bedroom. 

 I shaved and showered, all the regular morning ablutions. Put on my monkey- suit, and joined my wife and Kelly in the kitchen. 

 They were laughing and chatting, and I got a big hug and kiss from each of them. Wendy laughed, "How was your morning so far, dear?" 

 "Excellent. Thank you for asking." 

 She smiled. "I got a second taste, thanks to sweet-cheeks. I think my morning was pretty excellent too." 

 Kelly giggled. "Me too!" 

 I ate breakfast with a naked 18 year old, the mother of my child sitting in an open robe, her goodies on display, and my daughter in the corner, making pretty little baby sounds. I hardly tasted the bacon and egg sandwich. 

 "We're going to run some errands today. I think I'm going to drop Jeannie off at my mother's. You going to be home on time?" 

 "I can pretty much guarantee that," I promised. 

 Wendy laughed. "That have anything to do with the pretty, naked girl, sitting at the table?" 

 "It has everything to do with my having the best damn wife in the whole world. No more late nights, if I can help it. I want to spend all my free time with the love of my life." 

 She got up and kissed me. "You know flattery doesn't work on me." 

 "Liar. You know damn well it does." 

 She kissed me again, giggling. "Ok, it does. You're going to get sooo lucky tonight." 

 I escaped her loving clutches and gave Kelly a quick kiss before I headed over to my daughter. I picked her up and kissed her, blowing a raspberry on her belly. "Be good for your Mommy, Angel," I told her, knowing damn well she couldn't understand a word I said. She cooed for me, and I thought life couldn't get any better. 

 "Do we have a spending limit?" Wendy asked as I passed her. 

 "Whatever the credit card is. Have fun. Think of me often." 

 "No way. I'm going to think of you all the time," she laughed. 

 * * * 

 Work was like any other day, until about 3:30. That's when Paul walked into my office. I felt a shiver run down my spine, and my blood pressure rising. 

 He closed the door. 

 I clenched my fists, under the desk. 

 "Hey, John. I just wanted to tell you I knew that Tom was a fucking liar. I can't believe that shit he said about your wife. We all know how crazy she is about you." 

 I was surprised, and blurted out, "What shit?" 

 He looked nervous. "I figured you knew. It doesn't matter. He told me he made it up, to get even with her for teasing him once too often, and said he was going to apologize to you. Whatever. I just wanted you to know. I figure you'd been acting a little weird since the party, and I hope it wasn't anything I said or did. I don't know if any of the other guys said anything, but I swear, I didn't or wouldn't. No way it was true, anyhow. Especially not with him. We're cool, right?" 

 I nodded slowly. "Sure. You and me are. I'm not happy with him. Spreading stupid rumors." 

 Paul finally sat down. "Shit, everyone knows he wants to get into your wife's pants, but she's shot him down so hard every time. I guess he felt he had to make stuff up, not to look like a fucking loser. Made him look all the more stupid if you ask me." 

 "I appreciate you telling me," I said, honestly. 

 "No problem. If anyone said crap about my wife that way, I'd want to know it, and I'd probably have to take matters into my own hands."  

 

 

===

"If anyone ever did, I'd not only tell you, but I'd help you make things right." 

 He grinned. "Good. I'd do the same. Let me know if you think you'd ever like any help. Slimy bastard. You don't do that shit to friends." 

 "I'll do that, but I think I'll take care of this on my own." 

 "If you need an alibi, let me know. I can set up a poker game which I can guarantee you attended." 

 God. I don't know why I'd been so pissed at Paul. He hadn't done anything, and here he was, standing up for me. "Thanks. I may take you up on that." 

 "We're going to have some people over, weekend after next. You and your wife going to able to make it?" 

 "I've got to check on the babysitter, but I don't think that will be a problem. Thanks." 

 He got up and opened the door. "Hope to see you there. Remember, you need help, call me first." He grinned. "Hell, my wife's almost as good looking as yours. What's to stop the asshole from targeting her next?" 

 "Got it. Thanks." 

 He smiled. "No problem." As he turned, he paused. "Uh...officially, Carla's the prettiest of all our wives. Officially." 

 I laughed with him. "Of course. Even unofficially, no doubt our women run one and two. Let's leave it at that." 

 * * * 

 When I got home, Kelly was on the floor, playing with Jeannie, wearing simple conservative shorts, and a nice knit top. She looked like a typical high schooler. She smiled at me. "Hi, handsome. You look nice in a suit. I think Wendy's in the bedroom." 

 I went over and gave my baby girl a kiss, then headed back to change. Wendy was making the bed. 

 "A little late in the day for that," I mentioned, taking off my coat. 

 She ran over and gave me a hug and a kiss, like we'd been apart for a year. "Welcome home, husband mine. Have I told you I love you lately?" 

 "Not for almost 9 hours. I love you too." 

 "You better wait until I tell you about the shopping first. We've been gone all day." 

 I groaned teasingly, and she looked at me nervously. She saw me smile and smacked me. "Don't scare me like that!" 

 I laughed and hugged her. "We still have the house and both cars, right?" 

 She nodded, grinning. 

 "Then whatever you spent is fine." I gave her a quick kiss, then stopped. "We don't have a new mortgage do we?" 

 She slapped my arm again. "God, John, I didn't spend that much." 

 "I know. But you're so easy to tease." 

 She gave me a warm kiss. "We'll see who teases who, tonight." 

 "Looking forward to it." 

 She pulled out of my arms, and went back to finishing the bed. "Change and clean up, we're having happy hour." She grinned. "I pumped plenty today, so I might get a little tipsy. Jeannie's dinner is in the fridge." 

 "How's things with Kelly?" 

 "Perfect. We'll talk about that later, Ok?" 

 "Whatever you want." 

 "What I want is your big juicy cock in my mouth," she said with a smile. "But I can be patient too. It's Friday, we have nothing we have to do tomorrow, so I'm hoping we can make a late night of it." 

 "Sounds like a plan. Have I told you lately that I love you?" 

 She waited for me to get my shirt on, then hugged me. "Not in ages. Are you sure about that?" 

 "I'll let you know tomorrow morning." 

 She kissed me, then bit my lip. "Bastard. Say it. Say it now." 

 "I love you, Wendy Reed. More than I could ever imagine possible. You make my life complete." 

 She kissed my bruised lip. "Better. Not perfect, but better." She smiled, and squeezed my ass. "God, I want you." 

 "I'm here." I squeezed her butt. "Kelly's watching Jeannie." 

 She dropped to her knees, and pulled manically at my belt, opening my pants and pulling them down to my knees. "Don't hold back. I want your cum in my mouth, and want it soon!" 

 She sucked me like a demon, and once I was hard, I held her head and pumped into her mouth, making her gag a couple of times. She pushed forward steadily on my cock, and I gasped as I entered her throat for the first time. She looked up at me, and held me deep, then pulled off, gasping. "Give it to me, John. Gimme it all!" 

 I couldn't remember the last time I'd come so quickly for her. She managed to take me down her throat one more time, then her hand was a blur on my shaft, while her mouth held the crown of my cock, her tongue doing wild and crazy things. I moaned in pleasure as I filled her mouth. 

 Wendy sucked me carefully, tenderly, leaving my cock clean. She smiled, her mouth closed, then opened it a little, to show me her prize, before winking and closing it again. She had that silly little smile that I loved so much, which she'd stolen from me by doing it after sucking the asshole's cock. I drove that thought from my mind, while she pulled my pants back up, tucked my shirt in, and fastened my button. 

 She walked out and I followed her. She went to the family room, and I watched her kneel down next to Kelly. She took the teen's face in her hands and kissed her. Several seconds later, they parted, both smiling. Kelly looked over at me, and grinned. "Ssank oou," she said, the results of my blowjob visible in her mouth. 

 Wicked women. 

 Wendy got up grinning, her mouth closed, humming to herself, her silly smile back. I sat on the ground and played with my baby, peeking up at Kelly. She had her own version of that special smile, hers more of a smirk. I knew I was looking forward to seeing it often. 

 She sat back, leaning against the couch, and watched me play with Jeannie. I was eagerly awaiting the day my little girl could crawl, hold things, play more actively. 

 Wendy walked in and set drinks down on the table, nodding to me. She still had that smile. "Swallow, you harlot." 

 She grinned, shook her head, and ran out of the room as I started to get up. Kelly gave me a closed-mouth giggle. "You too, naughty girl." 

 She opened her mouth and showed me her cum covered tongue. She stuck her finger in, wet it, and pulled out a sticky strand, then sucked it noisily back. 

 "God, you're as bad as her." 

 "No," she gargled. "As goo' as her." She grinned wickedly, and blew a little cum bubble, giggling. 

 I was surprised at how clearly she could speak with her mouth full. 

 Wendy returned with snacks, picked up Jeannie and placed her in the playpen. She and Kelly sat on each end of the couch, and patted the space between them. 

 "Swallow first." 

 They both shook their heads, looking at each other and giggling. God, I'd created monsters. I accepted my defeat and took my seat. 

 It was five minutes of relative silence and slow sips of their drinks before they started talking normally. "How was your day?" Wendy asked. 

 "Funny you should ask. Paul stopped by and invited us to a party next weekend." 

 "That's nice. I always liked Paul and Carla. They say if it was Ok to bring a guest?" 

 "I forgot to ask. I just assumed it was." 

 Wendy rolled her eyes. "You are such a man. I'll call and make sure. Anything else?" 

 "Yes, as a matter of fact. He told me that he was worried I was upset with him after the party. He said he was pissed at Tom, and never believed him anyway. There's no way you would do anything behind my back, you loved me too much, and certainly not with Tom. He mentioned that Tom had confessed that he'd lied about doing something with you, he wouldn't say what, but if I was pissed off enough to do something about it, he'd be happy to help. Tom deserved it for lying about you, especially since we're friends." 

 I took a sip of my drink. "You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?" 

 Wendy got up, and returned a minute later with her purse. She pulled out a small voice recorder, and a deposit slip, and passed them both to me. The deposit was for $12,000. I looked up in surprise. 

 "You now have two ex-whores living under your roof," she said. 

 I didn't know what she was saying, and looked over at Kelly. She leaned in and kissed me on the cheek. "Could you make that a little clearer?" I asked. 

 Wendy took a long drink, then set her glass down. "It was something you said that first night. About my blow jobs costing you about $1500 each in the last month. I figured if they cost you that much, they should cost those other bastards at least that, if not more. I would certainly have given my husband a discount." 

 I looked at her in surprise. 

 "Each night I met with a different one of them. I got a room at the hotel, and asked them if they'd like a repeat. You can guess what each said." 

 "You went to a hotel with them for another blowjob?" I asked, getting irritated. 

 Kelly hugged me. "Shut up and listen, handsome." 

 Wendy smiled. "I met them, wearing something naughty, and I got them to tell me what they thought of our previous, uhh meetings." She grabbed the recorder, and I heard Aaron's voice. "God, Wendy. You were fantastic. I swear nobody has ever given me a blowjob half as good as yours." She cut it off. 

 "They received the worse ones I've ever given, except for maybe my first. Hell, come to think of it, worse than that one too!" 

 "You blew them again!" I snapped. 

 Kelly gave me another squeeze, and a slap on the shoulder. "Damn it, John! Shut up and listen, or I'm not sleeping in your bed tonight." 

 I looked at her in surprise, then back at Wendy when she started talking again. 

 "Of course, once I had them on tape, talking about what we'd done, I knew I had them. I took out the invoice and handed it to them. They didn't know what was going on, so I had to explain. 

 "Two-thousand dollars. That's what my blowjobs are worth. My husband only paid $1500, but he gets a special discount. You owe me two-thousand dollars." 

 I heard the words, but I was still bothered. The math didn't add up. 

 "They resisted at first, but I convinced them it was in their best interest, and in the best interest of their marriages, to pay up. Once I had the money, I told them that if they ever spoke about what they'd done, not only would I give the tape and a copy of the check to their wives, but I'd tell you the truth and you'd kick their asses. I also told them they had 24 hours to tell anyone that they'd spoken to about it, that they had lied. If I heard about it from even one person, their wives would get the info, and you'd be paying them a visit. They agreed." 

 She laughed. "Jarrod thought it was still a pretty good deal, and offered to pay me for another one." 

 "That son-of-a-bitch! Is that why it's twelve thousand? There were only three of them!" 

 Kelly giggled, kissing my neck. "Stop, silly man. She's getting to the good part." 

 "Of course I didn't," my wife continued. "I thanked him, but told him I was retired. He was pretty good about it, and asked me to keep him in mind if I ever came out of retirement." 

 "Then where'd the extra money come from?" 

 "Tom had to pay for three of course. He was pretty mad about that. Then I charged him another thousand for each of his friends that he invited, without my permission. I was a little afraid of him, he was getting angry, and yelling pretty loudly." 

 She opened her purse, and took out a little black device. "I used the taser you bought. I hope you don't mind. It arrived just in time, I met with him last. I told him that since he was paying an extra two grand, I would give him one more for old time's sake." 

 I looked at her in shock, trying to assimilate what she was saying. One last one for old time's sake? 

 "He calmed down a little, and I helped him take his clothing off. I took his shirt off from behind, and tased him good. He fell to the floor, and I tased him again, for good measure. I found out the secret about these things. You've got to hold it a while, not just poke them with it. About 5 seconds does the job. He was down for the count after the third time, and I found out that more than 5 seconds or so was overkill. Then I took some pictures, including one that would look really bad for him. I didn't actually touch him there, but it was close enough to look good on the camera." 

 I looked at my wife in surprise. Ballsy girl. I didn't think she had it in her. 

 "I figured he'd been really mean to me. I hated that he almost broke up my marriage, and he'd been hounding me forever. I wanted that to stop. Those zip- ties you bought came in handy. I had no idea they came that big. You really did think of everything. Mom didn't let you in on it, did she?" 

 I could only shake my head no. 

 Wendy shrugged. "Whatever, it worked out perfectly. He started to react before I got to his hands, so he made me tase him again. I wasn't going to if I didn't have to. I figured three times would be enough, then I thought, hell, he'd used my mouth three times, and was planning to do it again, so another one was only fair. He really didn't like that one, since I did it down there, you know? I may have done it a little longer than needed. He wouldn't stop moving." 

 I groaned and felt my own cock shriveling in sympathy. Kelly laughed. "She's an evil bitch. I'm glad she's on our side." 

 Wendy giggled, taking another drink. "He was pretty docile after that, until I shoved the unlubed 12" dildo up his butt. Man, that took some work. I almost threw up, but sometimes a girl has to do what a girl has to do. What a friggin' wuss! He whined and cried, but I was still pissed at him. Inviting his friends to use me was evil. He should have just paid up." 

 She ate one of the snacks. 

 "You owe me for a new dildo, by the way. I didn't want it after that." 

 "We don't have any dildos," I told her. 

 "We didn't. We have a few now. None that big. I figure we can try some experimenting. You did say I could tell you if I wanted to try something new, remember?" 

 I nodded. 

 "Good. So, where was I? Oh, yeah. Huge dildo up his ass. Some more pictures of course. By then he was begging pretty nicely. Especially when I told him if he didn't behave, I'd neuter him." 

 She pulled out my new folding hunting knife and put it on the table. 

 "I guess the knife was pretty convincing. I practiced opening it like I saw on TV. You know, that fast wrist snap? I let him know how unhappy I was with how he'd pursued me, and wore me down when I was too drunk to know any better. I'm not making an excuse, baby. It was my fault. But he did get me stupid sloppy drunk at our barbecue, giving me really strong drinks, and it was my first time drinking alcohol in so long, it hit me hard." 

 She took a sip of her drink, slowly. 

 "I guess by then he was seeing the light. I went through his wallet and found he had a blank check folded up in it. Perfect, saved me time and trouble. I left that big stick in his butt, and held the taser against his puny, shriveled up balls, before I put that check in front of him. I left his hands and feet secured, just in case. He signed the check, for the full eight thousand, and I told him I'd cash it today, so the money had better be in there. He promised it would be. Of course I told him the same deal about his wife getting the tape, a copy of the check, where I'd filled in the note field with 'oral services rendered', and of course the pictures. Everyone he knew would get a copy of him with that huge chunk of rubber in his butt." 

 She pulled out her camera, and showed me the picture. "God-damned ugly butt too, don't you think, Kelly?" 

 She looked at it. "I've seen worse, but not by much. Way too hairy." 

 "Not like studly's, huh?" Wendy giggled. 

 "Hell no. Our boy's got a butt like a dancer. Yum." 

 Wendy leaned in and gave me a kiss. "So that's about it. I left him there, with his wrists and legs still zip-tied, a pen knife just out of reach, and that thing in his ass. Today I cashed the check and deposited it. From what you're saying, I guess they probably confessed their little lies about poor innocent me. Everyone knows I would never cheat on you. I love you. We have the best sex life of any couple we know. Every damn last one of their wives know it. When we sit around and talk shit about our husbands, I never have anything bad to say. You know that's not fair, right? You should at least give me something to complain about." 

 She stood up, and removed her shorts, then her panties, leaving her bare-assed. Kelly moved out of the way, as if she knew what was up, and Wendy laid down in my lap, her exposed butt held high. 

 "I want you to spank me. I was a very bad girl. You need to make sure that if I ever do anything stupid again, I know what I'll have coming. You're going to blister my poor ass, until I have to sit on a pillow. When you fuck me, every time you press my ass into the bed, and every time you slam your hard hips into them, I want to be reminded. As a side benefit, whenever it comes to bitching about our husbands, I'll be able to contribute about the brute who spanks my butt when I get out of line. I'll let you decide how many I deserve. If you don't do it right, I'll make Kelly finish it." 

 She looked up at me. "Please don't let that happen. She's still very angry at me for the way I almost screwed everything up. She's threatening to use the belt." 

 In a day full of surprises, that took the cake. I looked over at Kelly. "Do me a favor, Angel? Put Jeannie in her crib. I don't want her to hear her mother cry." 

 She smiled and did just that. 

 As soon as she left the room, I walloped Wendy's ass, hard. She jumped and shrieked. "You don't think I'm going to take it easy on you, just because I love you more than life itself, do you?" 

 She shook her head. "No. I know you love me enough to do it right," she whimpered. 

 The second blow on the other cheek was even harder, and she cried out. It stung my hand. For a moment I thought it might be easier to use my belt. 

 I was still angry at her, even though I had tried to bury it. That stupid silly smile of hers ate at my gut. The sound of that bastard on the tape, had made it worse. 

 I spanked her roughly. No ritualistic spanking, I swatted her ass fast and hard, all over the place, taking no breaks until long after Kelly had returned. Wendy was crying, reaching back to cover her ass with her hands. Kelly knelt in front of me and held Wendy's hands behind her back, firmly. 

 I spanked her until my hand ached, and my wife's beautiful ass was crimson. "Damn your cheating ass!" I snapped at her, toward the end, and smacked her as hard as the first two. 

 She screamed, then dropped her head sobbing. "I'm sorry," she sobbed. "Never again, I swear." 

 I swatted her a few more times, just for show. "You bet this cherry-red ass you won't. I won't be this gentle next time. I will use the belt." 

 She was shaking, and Kelly let go of her hands, as I stopped, gently rubbing her burning cheeks. They were scarlet, and her flesh was twitching, involuntarily. I realized I might have overdone it. The beating she'd received bordered on abuse. 

 Wendy looked over at Kelly, who had tears in her own eyes. "Good enough?" she sobbed nervously. 

 "Yes. You deserved that you know. I would have been harder on you." 

 She nodded, her hands rubbing her cheeks tenderly. "I know." She looked back at me, her eyes red and puffy, her nose running. "Thank you. I'll remember that always. I don't ever want another one." 

 I leaned down and kissed her cheeks tenderly. "I hope to God I never have to do that again. I think that hurt me worse than anything you ever did. I hope you're proud of yourself." 

 She slid off my lap, knees on the ground then rested her head in my lap, working her hands behind me, clinging to me. "I'm so, so, so, sorry. I hate what I did to us." 

 "We're fine now," I told her, caressing her hair. I held her while she sobbed. After a few minutes I realized that Kelly had left and come back. 

 She had a bottle in her hand. "It took me a while to find what I needed." 

 She squirted the aloe lotion in her hand, and rubbed it gently on my wife's butt. "This is going to bruise," she said softly. "You really gave her a good one." 

 "First and last." 

 Kelly smiled. "We'll see about that. You'll never have to give her one this bad again, but I have no doubt she'll earn another. She's an ornery girl."  

 

 

===

Wendy sat back a little, wincing. "Did I do alright making things better?" she asked. 

 "Better than alright. I'm proud of you. I don't know if I would have done as well myself." 

 She smiled tentatively. "Don't be too mad at Jarrod. Poor boy was willing to pay another two grand for the worst blowjob in the city. He'd probably have mortgaged his house and sold both his kids for what you get." She turned and faced Kelly. "You've really been undercharging." 

 Kelly grinned. "Now I find out. I could be living on easy street." 

 Wendy stood and pulled her panties up, grimacing, then got on her knees and leaned her torso on the couch pillow. "Damn, my ass feels like it's on fire, John! Were you really that mad at me?" 

 I nodded. "That look you have, self-satisfied, when your mouth is full of cum? You had that smile going today." 

 She grinned. "I earned it. I got you off quick." 

 I nodded sadly. "Yes. But you also had it that night at the party." 

 She looked at me in horror. "Oh God. I didn't! Please tell me I didn't!" 

 "I wish I could. You broke my heart. I... I thought that smile was only for me." 

 "It is, John. I swear it is. I didn't hold their cum. I didn't. It was nasty, and I swallowed as fast as I could. I had to take a drink afterward. With Aaron, I... I had to spit it out. I swear to God. You have to believe me!" 

 "I saw it, Wendy." 

 "No! It was for you. I was sitting there, thinking about getting you home and giving a real blowjob. One that I would enjoy. I was remembering your taste, the feel, the smell of you. You're all I ever want. Nobody has ever done it for me like you. You have to believe me." She turned to Kelly. "You tell him. You know it's true. His is the best. There's nothing like it. Tell him. Please, you have to!" 

 Kelly climbed up next to me, and wrapped her arms around my neck. "I believe her, John. There's nothing like you. I knew it this morning. It was the best I ever had, and I had to run and share it with her. Thanking her for letting me have just that little bit of you. She wouldn't lie to you, John. Not to you." 

 Wendy was shaking her head wildly. "See? It was you. Thinking about you. Like when I call you at work, to tell you I can still taste you. Sometimes it's hours after I've swallowed. I can still taste it. I know I have that smile then. I can close my eyes and taste it now. Please say you believe me!" 

 I looked at my poor wife, desperate for my approval, her ass stuck out, glowing. I reached out and caressed her hair. "I didn't know. I'm sorry. I do believe you." 

 She scooted over and put her head in my lap again. "No wonder you were so mad at me. You thought I liked it. I like doing it, and I like the feeling of control it gives me, but that was it. I never liked anything else about it when it came to those assholes." 

 "Shh. No more talk. I don't want to think about it. It's over. Let's not talk about it again." 

 I finished my drink, and looked down at her. "Does your mother know everything?" 

 She shook her head. "No. She knows some of what I was planning. She doesn't know about Tom, or that I finished." 

 "Why don't you invite her over and tell her?" 

 "Now? I can't. I can't even sit down!" 

 I got up and returned with the phone. "Call her." 

 "Please, John! Tomorrow, Ok? Tomorrow." 

 I dialed the number and passed the phone to her. She took it in her hand and stared at it in terror. "Mom?" 

 "No nothing's wrong. Actually every thing's pretty great. Do you think you could stop by for a bit?" 

 "No, I swear nothing's the matter. I want to tell you how things worked out. I thought maybe you could visit a while, and maybe take Jeannie for the night. John and I have some celebrating to do." 

 "Great, see you soon. Give my love to Dad." 

 She handed me the phone. Then she smiled. "Man, is she going to be pissed at you." 

 "I'll take my chances." 

 * * * 

 Carol showed up and I greeted her at the door. She gave me a big hug, and another of those way-too-friendly Mother-in-law kisses. "Things alright with you kids?" 

 "Never better, Mom." 

 She smiled, "You have no idea how happy that makes me." 

 "Me too, believe me. They're in the kitchen." 

 The girls were finishing up dinner preparations. Wendy had stopped drinking when she decided to send Jeannie over to her mother's for the night. She wanted to lose her buzz before one last feeding. 

 Carol stood in the kitchen entrance, surprised. "You're back, Kelly?" 

 Kelly nodded, "Yep. I hope that's not a problem." 

 "No, dear. A little surprising. I thought you'd left." 

 "I did. I'm almost as big an idiot as goof-ball here." 

 "Wendy, I don't think you're dressed appropriately for company," Carol observed, looking at her daughter. 

 "Oh, Mom! I couldn't even think about putting pants on. John spanked the living daylights out of me, and my poor bottom is in agony!" She practically smirked at me. 

 "You should have put a skirt on then. Just make sure you don't wear anything with pleats, or it'll smart when you sit." 

 Wendy looked hurt. "Didn't you hear what I said? He spanked me! Really bad!" 

 Carol snapped at her. "You damn well deserved it, didn't you? I wouldn't blame him if he gave you four more beatings, one for each of those times you cheated on him. He's too forgiving, if you ask me." 

 "But he hurt me! I won't be able to sit for days. Look!" She turned and pulled down her panties, showing her bright red ass." 

 "No belt marks? Jesus, John, don't tell me you let her get away with a bare hand spanking!" Carol said. 

 Kelly laughed. "That's what I said. I would have used his belt." 

 Wendy wouldn't let it go. "Mom!" 

 "Not another word from you. You say one more bad thing about your man, try to get me angry for giving you what you deserve, and I swear, I'll take you in back and give you what your father should have years ago. He was too damned easy on you, both you and your sister, and I always told him so." 

 Wendy dropped it, went back to our bedroom, and returned wearing a skirt. I preferred her in the panties, but we did have company. 

 Carol stayed for dinner, and Wendy told her the whole story. She sat on one of the bedroom pillows at the table, when her mother insisted it was rude of her to try to eat while standing. Wendy wriggled around a lot, wincing in pain regularly. 

 When the entire tale was finished, without the slow denouement with props that I'd gotten, it seemed that I wasn't the only one proud of her. "Aloe with lidocaine," Carol said. 

 "What?" 

 "Tomorrow, not tonight. You don't get any relief tonight. Use some aloe with lidocaine. It's good for the skin and will take care of the worst of the pain. Most of the time, I would tell you to endure and remember why you got it. But you did a good thing, baby. I'm so proud of you, that I'm taking advantage of a mother's prerogative. Use the aloe with lidocaine tomorrow." 

 "How do you know about that?" Wendy asked. 

 Her mother blushed. She looked at me, and smiled shyly. "You know how I get, John. After you called the other day, Ed made me tell him why I was so upset. He was quite angry that I'd accused you of anything. I think we all know better. He let me use the aloe with lidocaine Sunday, after we felt that we'd worked things out. He must have been pretty happy with me, he almost never lets me use anything like that." 

 Wendy was looking at her mother in shock. I imagine I didn't look a whole lot better. 

 Carol turned back to her daughter. "What? Like you didn't know? You've seen how I get. Having a temper is the pits." She turned back to me. "If you have a problem with her using the lotion tomorrow, you'll just have to take it up with me. I'll call Ed if I have to and get his permission." 

 "No, I, uh, don't think that will be necessary." 

 Carol gave me a mischievous grin. "Too bad. If you change your mind, let me know. Or if I do anything else to piss you off. Don't call me names in the back of your mind. I've already told you once to call me on it if I do. I think you know how." 

 Kelly laughed. "Not me. I'm gonna be good." 

 We were drinking our coffee, and I think Carol was dragging things out, just to torture her daughter. "Speaking of which, Kelly, what's your status now? Are you back for good?" 

 Kelly blushed, then looked over at me. "Wendy said I could stay. We got my stuff today. I'm going to finish up my schooling." 

 Carol grinned, then got up and ran around the table, and hugged her. "I'm so glad, honey. You had us all so worried! Why did you ever get it in your thick skull to leave?" 

 "I...I couldn't stand the idea that I might make things bad for them." 

 "Oh you sweet, sweet, foolish girl. They wanted you to stay. You know that. What were you thinking? Didn't you know that if anything bad happened to you, none of us would ever forgive ourselves? That was very selfish." 

 "I thought I was doing the right thing," Kelly said. 

 "Well, at least now you have. What are you guys going to tell everyone? It's going to look kind of suspicious, a little hottie like you moving in." 

 Wendy spoke up. "She's my second cousin, and she's going to be our nanny, if anyone cares." 

 Mom laughed. "They'll care, believe me. You guys are going to be gossip central for a while. Try to keep it clean in public, will you? At least for the next few weeks." 

 I think I was still in shock. That was the kind of week it was. 

 Kelly blushed, and turned toward me. "I didn't mean to spring it on you like this. Are you alright with everything?" 

 I probably had that fish-out-of-water look going. I found it hard to speak. In the end, the best I could do was nod. 

 Carol got up, and stretched. "Damn, you kids eat good. I can't believe you all aren't rolling around instead of walking. Now where's my granddaughter?" 

 "In the playpen. I'm going to feed her before you go. I've got a couple more bottles pumped in the 'frig. You all have wiped out my stores. I'm going to have to pump like mad to build them up again. My poor boobs are gonna be sore for days!" 

 We sat in the family room, Wendy was in my chair, with our daughter in her lap. I was stationed on the couch between Carol and Kelly. Kelly was being a little more discreet than usual, not leaping on me or any of that stuff. Not that I minded. 

 Carol was sipping on a glass of wine, curled up beside me, turned sideways. "You satisfied with her solution?" she asked abruptly. 

 It took a second for me to realize she was talking about the payback. Not the Kelly stuff. "I'm still digesting. I probably should be, but it's hard to let it go. Part of what I was planning was to let their wives know, at least Misty. He almost destroyed my marriage, I feel it's the least I could do for him." 

 Carol nodded. "Might be kind of cruel to Misty and the kids. I know it's tempting, but you should think about the fall out. If it causes their breakup, everyone's going to hear about the cause. Do you really want that?" 

 "I know. But if it was happening behind my back, I would want to know. Doesn't Misty have that same right?" I turned to Wendy. "Wouldn't you want to know?" 

 She shrugged. "I'm not sure. Besides, obviously I'm pretty useless at moral decisions. What do you think, Mom?" 

 Carol leaned back pensively. "I guess it depends on the situation. If it was a one-time mistake, it might be for the best to let it die and be buried. An ongoing issue is different." 

 I nodded. "Agreed. I could see maybe letting Jarrod or Aaron slide. They didn't instigate things, and it was only one time. Tom, on the other hand was the one that pressured her into it, three times, and invited others to do the same." I looked over at Wendy, who seemed to be nervous about the whole discussion. "I gotta admit, Wendy did pay him back pretty harshly, where the others got off a little too easy for my taste. I'm going to need some time I think." 

 Carol put her hand on my arm. "That's good. Let the rage go a bit. Give it some time and see how they respond to what's happened so far. You can always pursue your own agenda at a later date." 

 Kelly's demure ways were slipping as she stretched out, her bare feet resting in my lap, toes wiggling. "What did you have planned?" she asked. 

 "I'm not sure. I have to admit, there was going to be an element of physical pain in whatever I did. I wish I could say I was better than that, but I really wanted to kick their asses severely." I reached down and started rubbing Kelly's arches. 

 She was relaxing more, stretched out. "You should get some of this Mom, he's really got a nice soft touch." 

 Carol, laughed. "I don't think he wants an old woman's feet in his lap, when he's got a young cutie like you." 

 I reached over and grabbed her ankle, where she was sitting on her feet, and pulled it into my lap. She fell back, almost spilling her drink. "John! Don't be silly!" 

 I ran my thumb along her arch, pushing in, moving slowly. She tried to pull her foot away, but I swatted the bottom of her foot. "Behave Mom." 

 She eventually gave in, and her second foot joined the first. "I don't know what's gotten into you, John. This really isn't like you." 

 "Do you know your daughter was surprised when I suggested she talk to you first? She said I didn't like you." 

 Carol took a moment to answer. "I didn't think you did, either. I certainly never gave you any reason to. I'd have to say your suggesting me to intervene surprised me as much as anyone." 

 "It's not that I don't like you, or didn't like you. I figured you didn't like me. You or Ed. Never really gave me a chance. Looked down on me from day one. I was irritated, more than anything else, and didn't feel like trying to prove myself over and over again," I explained. 

 She leaned back, and wiggled her toes expectantly when I gave Kelly's some attention. I finally got it worked out where I could use one hand on each. "It wasn't you, honey. She was so young. Our baby. Alice was four years older, and still not married. Wendy was barely out of college, and you acted so serious. She was infatuated, and that had us worried. We didn't know you. You understand, don't you?" 

 I shrugged. 

 Carol sighed. "Try to understand. It wasn't you, as much as anybody. It was too soon." 

 "Almost six years now. You never got over it?" 

 Carol blushed. "Ed did. He thinks you're friends now. But he's not good at showing things like that. He offers you a beer, and a seat in front of the TV. That's about as chummy as he gets. Me? You know how I am by now. I can be rotten, I know it. I cling to every perceived slight, real or not. We talked about it. I don't know how to let things go." 

 She grinned, and lifted her free foot, rubbing it against my side playfully. "You're better than me. I couldn't believe you'd turn to me when things got ugly. That means a lot, you know." 

 "You're honest, and moral, and you love your daughter and granddaughter like nobody else. I figured you might have enough influence on her to help." 

 Kelly was teasing, pressing her foot into my crotch. Rotten girl. "She was the best, John. You did good. Marcie helped too, but Mom was the difference." 

 "I never doubted her for a second. Not when it came to saving our marriage." 

 Carol pulled her feet from my lap, and crawled up next to me. "You're too damned sweet." She put her arms around my neck, and kissed my cheek. "Thank you." 

 Wendy walked over with Jeannie, feeding time over. "Behave Mom. He's mine. Thanks to you and Kelly. Don't make me tell Dad on you." 

 Carol leaned back and took my daughter in her arms. "Tell Ed? For what? I'm being good. Can't I even give my favorite boy a thank-you kiss?" 

 Wendy giggled. "As long as that's all you give him." 

 Carol blushed. "I would never push the boundaries. I'm not so old I can't flirt a little, but I'm not a cheater, and would never participate in anyone else cheating. Unlike some people I know." 

 Wendy turned away, and I could see she was unhappy. "That was uncalled for Carol. She was only teasing. We can't keep throwing her mistakes in her face if we want to get past this." 

 She glared at me for a second, then seemed to calm. "You're right. I'm sorry Wendy." She grinned. "Am I going to have to call Ed, and let him know I'm being punished?" 

 I laughed and put my arm around her. "Not today. But that's one strike." 

 She stood, and smiled at me. "I'll give Ed notice. Just in case." She went over to Wendy. "I am sorry. I guess I'm still a little angry. Call me later. We still need to talk about Alice. You haven't spoken to her, have you?" 

 Wendy shook her head. "She's left a couple of messages." 

 "Good. Leave her be. Where's the baby bag?" 

 "By the door, Mom. Let me get her milk." 

 They left me with Kelly, who seemed to think my lap was too empty, and promptly climbed in it. "They have a good relationship. Even if Mom is still a little pissed at her." 

 "They do. They're close. If Wendy had been talking to her more, and less to her sister, this would never have happened." 

 Kelly giggled, snuggling close. "But then you'd never have met me. I'd still be miserable. I'm sorry that it happened, but not for the results. I guess I'm a little selfish." 

 I gave her a hug. "Sometimes selfish is good." I lifted her from my lap. "I'm gonna say goodbye." 

 I intercepted them at the door, and gave my baby girl a last kiss, and another for my mother-in-law, who was better behaved. "Thanks for everything," I told her. 

 "That's what family's for, sugar. Have fun now. Don't do anything I wouldn't do." 

 I laughed. "Does that really eliminate anything?" 

 She grinned back. "I'm not telling." She let Wendy give her a hug, and we were alone again. 

 I got a big hug and kiss from my wife, pressed up against the door, and then was escorted back to my bedroom. "Give us a bit?" Wendy called out to our new permanent guest. 

 "You got it. I'll clean up. You kids have fun. Don't do anything I wouldn't do either." 

 Wendy closed our door, then started undressing. "Naked, in my bed. Now," she told me. 

 It only took me a few seconds, and shortly thereafter she joined me. She slid into my arms, holding me, and kissing me. "You're not mad, are you? I should have talked to you about Kelly first." 

 "No. I'm not mad. A little surprised. It would have been nice to be consulted." 

 She kissed my chest. "Of course. You know how I get. Sometimes I just don't think. She was telling me about the rules of her probation or whatever it is. She's not even supposed to be in the area of her apartment. When I heard that, we stopped shopping, and I made her get her stuff. The place was a real dump. One crummy room. Shared bathroom. Since she couldn't stay there, I knew she had to stay with us, at least until her time was up. Then it was a matter of how to explain it." 

 "I understand. I do. It's not a big deal. We have the space." 

 Wendy was moving south, and her attention to my waist and below was having the expected effect. "I gave her the Hawaiian guest room. We put her stuff in there. For now, I would like her to spend a few nights in here. She's pretty messed up, and she needs the attention and affection." She licked my shaft, annealing the steel within. "I'm not saying I want you two doing stuff together. At least not more than an occasional blowjob. You understand?" 

 "Sure. I don't want her. Not that she isn't cute and all, but you should know you're more than enough woman for me. You always have been. You always will be." 

 She gave me a long slow suck. "Do I need to spell out the rules for you?" she asked. 

 "Maybe. I'm not going after her, but if she gets a little... aggressive, I want to make sure she understands." 

 "Kissing, cuddling, hugging, that's all good. Give her all you want. It's what she needs now. Blowjobs, if they should happen, are only if I say so. Is that Ok with you?" 

 "More than Ok." 

 That got me another nice long suck. "Good. Sex is out of the picture. Besides, I don't think she's ready for that. She doesn't equate sex with anything good, right now. It would probably mess things up."  

 

 

===

"Why are we even talking about it, then? I have no need for her. Hell, it'll probably be a miracle if I can keep my own horny wife satisfied." 

 She laughed, then bobbed up and down on my shaft a while. "She may feel the urge to, well, pay you, for all the things we're doing for her. She's used to trading in sex." 

 "I got it. No stray payments." 

 She nodded, then was quiet, while she gave me her undivided attention down below. I watched, happy. She was at her best like that, beautiful, devoted to my pleasure. I noticed her butt was raised up high, not resting on her heels like she usually did. I imagined the 'attention' she'd received left it very tender. 

 Kelly came in the bedroom, and walked right past. "Ignore me. I'm taking another bath. I love your tub. Friggin' Jacuzzi in the bathroom." 

 My wife didn't even blink, continuing her quest to win my release. 

 I heard the water running in the bath, then Kelly showed up naked, sliding in next to me. "I hope you don't mind. I love to watch her with you." 

 "I don't mind. Wendy?" 

 Wendy didn't even look up. She shook her head a little, then a few seconds later gave us an 'OK' signal. 

 Kelly nuzzled my neck. "You're really alright with me staying here?" 

 "I'd be upset if you left," I told her, kissing the top of her head. 

 Her hand rubbed across my chest. "I won't get in the way. I promise. I'll help around the house any way I can. I swear I won't interfere in your marriage." 

 "I know. I just want you to be happy, Angel. You let me know what you need, and I'll do what I can." 

 She sighed. "Hold me, John? Hold me, and let me see what love is supposed to be like." 

 I gave her a squeeze, and we watched my wife pleasure me. I concentrated on what she was doing, let my own need surge. She went in for the kill, no longer playing any delaying games, and I groaned my release. 

 She held my cock in her mouth, but let my juices spill out around my cock. She smiled, and started licking and kissing, playing around. She looked up at Kelly. "Wanna help?" 

 Kelly shook her head. "Not this time. I want to watch you, if that's Ok?" 

 Wendy grinned. "Your loss." 

 A couple of minutes later she was still playing, and Kelly climbed off the bed. "Gotta check the bath. I kind of cheated, I had the water running slowly." She smiled and gave me a quick kiss. Then she was hugging Wendy from behind. "Take care of him." 

 "Always," Wendy responded. 

 When she'd finished her play, she climbed back up and into my arms. "Do you love me?" she asked. 

 "Silly girl. I love you more and more every day." 

 She kissed my shoulder. "I know you show it all the time, but I like to hear it. I'm not complaining, but you weren't saying it much, for the last few months. I know you show me, but the words, they're special to me." 

 I thought about it. She was right. I didn't tell her often enough. I thought it kind of undervalued the words when you said it all the time. I knew better now. "Thank you for letting me know. This is good, isn't it, being so open about what we need." 

 She nodded. "I don't know why I never told you." 

 "I should have noticed. You tell me all the time. I love hearing it from you. If a day should ever pass when I don't tell you how much you mean to me, how much I love you, call me on it. You mean the world to me, Wendy." 

 She was quiet, hugging me. "You are my world," she whispered. 

 Wendy lifted her body, and planted a soft kiss on my lips. "Round two?" 

 I laughed as she spun in place, straddling my face, while her mouth started on its journey to get me ready for another go. 

 I adjusted the pillow beneath my head, raising it to where I could reach her easily. As I licked her gently, playfully, I had a moment of doubt. Not about her, but about me. 

 Wendy seemed to enjoy when I went down on her, but it wasn't explosions and ecstasy. Given time I could get her off, but it was rarely easy. It was mind- blowing that she could have an orgasm without my touching her, simply by blowing me, and had no problem achieving her release during sex. 

 Was I a bad oral lover? It seemed almost criminal compared to how good she was. 

 

 She seemed to enjoy it, and encouraged me with her touches, movement, sweet noises and assurances. Still, it wasn't like I thought it should be. Maybe I'd read too much porn, seen too many videos. Women going crazy, when you do it. 

 I was distracted while tending her, by her actions, and my thoughts. I reached up and pulled her down to my mouth, and she gasped. 

 I smiled until I heard her words. "Gentle where you grab, baby. My ass is still on fire." 

 I caressed her bottom gently, and moved my hands outward to her hips, renewing my efforts. I wanted it to be good for her. 

 My one time with Kelly had been great. She'd responded so beautifully, making me feel strong and powerful, making a 'pro' come on my tongue. I couldn't be that bad, could I? 

 I'd never had these issues or concerns before. I knew it was my own insecurity. What had made her need to go to other men? Why couldn't I keep her happy and fulfilled? Was I an inconsiderate or untalented lover? I knew she loved giving me oral sex, but where was the skill in being a hard cock for her? 

 My wife certainly had no inkling of my concerns, wiggling her hips for me, moistening, while she continued her oral worship. I was slow hardening for her, my mind turning cartwheels, evaluating my own performance. Still, I couldn't resist her efforts and felt the stiffness resurging, hearing the appreciative "Mmmm" as she sucked me. 

 She was nowhere near to coming, when she lifted up, turning around again. "Mind if I'm on top?" 

 "Never," I assured her. 

 She leaned over and kissed me, "God, you have my motor running baby, I need this." 

 She lowered herself onto my staff, taking me easily, sliding all the way down. She started a gentle rocking, her hips rolling as she went, in her favorite motion. Her breath was shallow, fast, as her movement became more pronounced, taking more of my length, in longer strokes. 

 I liked to hold her ass in my hands in that position, but now I rubbed my palms across her sensitive cheeks gently, teasing. 

 "Spank me," she whispered. 

 I was surprised. It was the last thing I expected to hear from her. She was grinding at me, her moans and soft grunts assuring me she was getting very excited. I slapped her butt cheek, gently but with my cupped open hand. 

 "Oh!" she moaned. 

 I grinned. "You're such a bad girl, Wendy." I smacked her other cheek, only a little more firmly. 

 She whimpered, her legs shaking. "Sorry," she whined. 

 "Your mouth is mine, you understand?" I whispered forcefully, swatting the right cheek again. 

 "Yours, only yours," she gasped. 

 "Little whore, selling your blowjobs to our friends," I growled. I spanked the alternate rosy cheek hard. 

 She gasped, shaking. "Never again," she moaned. 

 "Naughty girl, bringing another woman into our bed," I whispered into her ear. 

 She whimpered again, and I grabbed her ass cheeks firmly in my hands and slammed my cock up into her, pounding her forcefully. 

 Wendy cried out, coming on my cock, her hands clutching at my shoulders desperately. I hammered my cock into her hard. "My pussy. My mouth. My ass," I snapped, each phrase emphasized by another deep stroke. 

 She was incapable of answering, her body responding powerfully, as deeply as she ever had before. I was astounded by her reaction. 

 I pulled her down viciously on my cock, burying it inside her. I raised both hands and slapped her burning cheeks fiercely. "Mine, Damn it!" 

 She screamed out again, quivering. "Yours," she whimpered. "Always." 

 She collapsed on me, and I could see she was sobbing, clutching me. Maybe I had gone too far. I rubbed her ass softly, then brought my arms up and hugged her, nudging my cock back and forth. 

 "I love you, naughty girl. Love you so damn much." I kissed her face tenderly, and her mouth covered mine, needily, passionately. 

 "Forgive me?" she pleaded. 

 "A hundred times over. I know all your love is for me." 

 She kissed my face desperately, dozens of little kisses, mixed with her salty tears. "God, John, I love you so much. Why are you so good to me, when I'm such a fuckup?" 

 I laughed, giving her a squeeze. "You're not. We know you made a mistake, but it wasn't because you didn't love me, or out of disrespect. You were missing something, and your idiot sister gave you some terrible advice. I understand that in some ways I let you down. We move forward now. As long as you'll have me." 

 "As long as I'll have you?" she laughed. "How's forever sound?" 

 I kissed her lovingly. "Sounds perfect. I'm the luckiest man around." 

 She giggled. "As long as you'll agree I'm the luckiest girl." 

 I was stroking a little more firmly into her, seeing her little smile. "We're the luckiest couple, alright?" 

 She nodded eagerly, then wiggled her hips. "You love fucking me, don't you?" 

 "What do you think?" I teased. 

 She lowered her body onto mine, calm, submissive, letting me have her. "Am I a good lover, John? I know you like my blow-jobs, but the rest?" 

 She was no end of surprises tonight. "Of course? Why would you even ask?" 

 "I don't know. I don't want you to get tired of me. I never want us to get into a rut. I want you to need me, feel passionate about me." 

 "How about me?" I asked nervously. "Am I all you need? Do I do it for you?" 

 She laughed. "After that? You even need to ask? God, I never dreamed sex could be as good as it is with you." 

 "How...how about orally," I asked, my weakness showing through. 

 "You're wonderful," she said softly. 

 "You almost never come for me when I do it," I said softly. "It takes you so long. Am I doing something wrong?" 

 She rose up a little and looked at me curiously. "Why would you think that?" 

 I shrugged, and noticed I'd stopped moving. "You're so good at it. I'm not in your league. I want it to be better for you," I confessed. 

 My cock slid out of her, and I realized I'd lost my erection. 

 Wendy looked at me worriedly. "Where...where did this come from? How long have you thought about this?" She eased off my body, clinging to my side. 

 "I don't know. I just was thinking about it now. I want to make you happy. I don't want you to ever need anyone but me. Never wonder about how other lovers might make you feel." 

 Her gaze was fearful, and her eyes teared up. "It wasn't about you, John. I swear, you're all I've ever wanted. You are a wonderful lover. Don't ever think it was about you, or that I wasn't satisfied." She gripped me fiercely, sobbing. "God, what have I done to us?" 

 "Shh. Don't cry. It's not that I don't believe you or trust you. I want things to be as good as possible. If I can do something better, that's all I want." 

 That didn't help, and she curled up, crying harder than ever. 

 Kelly walked out of the bathroom, and took in the scene. She climbed on the bed behind Wendy, and put her arms around my wife, silently, holding her. 

 After a bit, Wendy turned away from me, grabbing our new roommate, sobbing. "I've ruined everything, Kel. Everything! I could just die..." 

 Kelly smoothed her hair, kissing her forehead. "No you haven't. It's getting better, we all just need a little time." She raised her head and looked at me quizzically. I couldn't explain, not then, and I just shrugged. I rolled onto my side, behind my wife, and held them both in my arms. 

 "You haven't ruined anything. I love you. We're going to come out of this stronger than ever. I promise." 

 Kelly and I held her, kissed her, stroked her soft skin, brushed her tears away. We enveloped her in our bodies, caressing her, reassuring her. 

 It wasn't a good night. I didn't doubt that we'd have more bad ones in the future, but I was still confident we were moving forward, making our marriage stronger. Even, as odd as it may seem, with a cute little ex-whore in our bed. 

 I turned out the lights, adjusted the sheets, and pulled my wife into my arms. If she was going to shed tears, let them fall on my body, while I confessed my unmitigated love for her. 

 Kelly provided the comfort she could, quietly, her hand caressing us both gently, lovingly. Helping in the only way she could, in silent, warm support. 

 ==========================

======================== 

 Bad surprises and further consequences 

 ======================== 

 I woke nervously, and reached for the baby monitor. I wasn't hearing anything, then slowly realized she was at Carol's. I looked beside me, where my wife was sleeping on her belly, with Kelly cuddled up to her. They looked so calm and peaceful, nothing like last night. 

 Stretching, I slipped out of the bed, adjusting the covers over my girls. I didn't know what the plans were for today, but I knew that I needed to do some shopping of my own. Christmas was only a few days away, and I hadn't bought any presents. Typical man, I guess. 

 After my requisite bathroom break, behind closed doors so as not to wake the beauties, I retreated to the kitchen. I decided to go all out, it was Saturday after all. Fresh baked croissants, eggs Benedict, orange slices, and bacon, of course. I set the table, including a pillow from Kelly's room, for Wendy's chair. 

 I was still thinking about the payback for the bastards who'd taken advantage of my wife. Was it enough? I know I wanted more, but could I be satisfied with where it stood? Deep inside, the answer was crystal-clear. They had to pay. 

 I peeked in on the girls who were still sleeping peacefully. I contemplated waking them, then thought better of it. I returned to the kitchen, loaded up our breakfast tray with the meal I'd prepared, and brought it back to the bedroom. 

 As quietly as possible, I set up a folding tray beside the bed, then laid out the food. The smell must have worked its magic. I watched Kelly sit up, sleepily stretching. Damn, she had some cute titties. "I smell bacon," she said, grinning. She nudged her bedmate awake, and Wendy rolled over, wincing when her weight rested on her bottom. 

 "Breakfast is served, ladies," I told them. Wendy was still parked in the middle of the bed, but when I went to put the tray on her lap, she stopped me. "Potty break first," she murmured sleepily. 

 I lost both of them for a couple of minutes, then they returned to the bedroom, naked, giggling and chatting. I loved the way they interacted together. 

 The girls climbed in the bed, and I set the tray on Wendy's lap, and moved the bedside tray to where Kelly could reach it. I climbed in the bed beside Wendy and grabbed a piece of bacon. I had cooked a lot, knowing how much Kelly loved it, plus I shared her appreciation for the crispy meat candy. 

 We played around, feeding each other, joking. "What's the plan for today?" I asked. 

 "Free day," Wendy announced. "Although I'm going to hit Walgreens and get something for my bum. I can't believe it hurts as bad as it did when you first did it." 

 I almost apologized for overdoing it, then stopped. If anything, she probably deserved worse. I let it go. "I need to do some shopping," I told them. "Alone." 

 Wendy chuckled. "Still haven't done your Christmas shopping?" 

 "It's only the 22nd," I argued. "This is early for me." 

 Kelly snagged the last bacon slice, before I could, then broke it in half and passed me a share. How could you not love a girl like that? "Can I go along? I'd like to do some as well. I'll stay out of your way." 

 Wendy spoke up. "If someone will get me my lotion, I'll keep the home fires burning and watch Jeannie." 

 We finished our meal, and Kelly hopped up. "I'll take care of the mess. You two relax." 

 I was willing enough, and cuddled with my wife, playing with her tits. She laughed. "You going to miss when they get back to their normal size?" 

 I gave her nipple a suck, tasting a hint of her milk. "I loved them before, and I'll love them after. Of course, they're pretty amazing now," I teased. 

 "They're sore. Be gentle." 

 We were still cuddling, when Kelly climbed back in the bed, beside me. "What are we going to do now?" she asked, leaning into me. 

 Wendy laughed. "You want to get him ready for me?" 

 Kelly didn't need any more encouragement. She climbed under the covers and I felt her mouth on my cock. I didn't need much getting ready, my wife already had me feeling pretty randy. I didn't begrudge the teen her effort. 

 Wendy got on her hands and knees, her face over mine. "God, you're so spoiled." She kissed me, and I moaned. 

 "Luckiest man alive, with the best damn wife anywhere," I assured her. 

 She pulled up smiling. "Puppy me?" 

 "Love to," I told her. 

 I extracted myself from Kelly's oral attention, and moved behind my wife. I rubbed my cock against her opening, until she opened and I slid into her. I stroked inside her gently, gazing down on her bruised bottom. I caressed her buns carefully. 

 "Harder, baby, make me feel it," Wendy moaned. 

 Kelly was lying beside us, our audience, a little smile turning the corner of her lips up. "God, I love watching you guys together." 

 I grinned, blowing her a kiss. I grabbed Wendy's hips, and slammed my cock into her, making her cry out. I fucked her hard, my hips smacking against her poor ass. 

 "Fuck," she moaned, her head dropping to the bed. 

 I eased back for a bit, long-stroking her, then pounded her again, making her shiver. "Punish me, baby," she groaned. "I've been so bad." 

 I leaned over her, leaning my weight down on her shoulders, pushing her into the bed, as I fucked her even harder, making her grunt sweetly with every stroke. I felt her responding, but I was getting too excited. I pulled out of her, and she cried out, until I brought my mouth to her pussy, licking and sucking on her. She squealed, and I felt her come against my mouth, trembling sweetly. I moaned when I felt a mouth engulf my cock, and Kelly sucked me while I worked on Wendy. Her legs slid lower, until she was lying on her belly, and I followed her down. I kissed her poor bottom, caressing it softly. 

 Kelly relinquished my cock, and I straddled my wife, working my cock between her legs and back into her wet pussy. I pulled her hips up a bit, and screwed her steadily. 

 "Fuck me, baby. Fuck your pussy," Wendy grunted. 

 Kelly snuggled up to Wendy, and whispered in her ear. My wife nodded, and Kelly kissed her softly, then climbed down the bed, kissing Wendy's soft cheeks, before turning her head sideways, her mouth open, waiting patiently. 

 The idea was mind-blowing, and I pulled out of my wife, sliding my cock between Kelly's lips. I fucked her mouth, holding her head, pushing deep. Her eyes stayed locked on mine, until I pulled out and pushed back into my wife. 

 I spent several minutes switching between the two, getting more excited by the moment. 

 I had just pulled out of Kelly's mouth, and was pounding into Wendy, when our new housemate spoke up. She spread Wendy's cheeks, tickling her butthole. "She's got a pretty little backdoor. You ever do her here?" 

 I slowed my stroking. "Sometimes. Not that often." 

 "You don't like it?" Kelly asked. 

 "I do. I don't think she does very much," I confessed. 

 She sucked her finger then pushed her fingertip into it, and I heard my wife's moans pick up in intensity. 

 "She doesn't seem to mind. You should take her here more often. She's yours, remind her." 

 I moaned, and slid my cock back into Kelly's mouth. 

 Wendy turned her head. "I like it, John. I've told you. I like doing it for you." 

 "You never come from it," I replied. 

 She wiggled her ass. "I don't need to come all the time. I love sucking you, and I don't come from that very often. I love when you fuck my butt. It's special. I've never done that with anyone but you." She giggled. "Maybe not right now, I prefer to clean up first, and my cheeks really are sore." 

 I slid my cock back into Wendy, and Kelly resumed playing with Wendy's back door, her tongue teasing her, her finger sliding inside, up to the second knuckle. 

 Wendy started shaking. "Coming," she gasped. 

 I grabbed her hips, fucking her as hard as I could. I was near my own finish, and wanted to come with her. She beat me by several strokes, but she had a second sweet orgasm for me when I came inside of her. 

 Gasping, I pulled my cock out and offered it to Kelly. She took me gently, sucking me dry, cleaning me. When she pulled back, I climbed off my wife, and lifted Kelly up to kiss her. 

 I laid back on the bed, my breath heaving. I watched Kelly move down the bed, pushing Wendy's legs apart. She ran her finger down out of sight, then pulled it back up, sucking it clean. 

 "She's such a trouble maker," Wendy chuckled. 

 I groaned, stroking my resurgent hard-on, when I saw Kelly move her head lower and disappear between my wife's legs. Wendy gasped, lifting her hips. Kelly lifted her head a few seconds later, her mouth moist, grinning. 

 "I thought you didn't do girls?" I teased. 

 Kelly blushed. "I love the taste of you fresh out of her. I figure I'd probably like to taste you directly from her." 

 "And do you?" 

 She smiled, and went back for seconds. 

 "Push it out for her, baby," I told my wife, scooting over next to her. 

 She shook her head. "No. It's mine. I earned it. She wants it, she's going to have to take it." She suddenly squealed. "No fair! Tongue only, Kel!" 

 Kelly sat up, grinning. She wiped her mouth with her hand, then crawled up the bed, wiggling in between me and my wife, like a spoiled kid. "I love you guys. You're the best." 

 Wendy turned on her side, cuddling up to Kelly. She brought her lips down on hers, kissing her deeply. "Naughty girl," she murmured afterward. "You stole my cum." 

 Kelly kissed her back. "We'll get you a new one. He's already hard again." 

 "Really?" 

 I laughed. "What do you expect after that little display?" 

 The girls teamed up against me, and gave me the most amazing dual blowjob ever. They were playing, taking turns sucking me, kissing each other, licking me. They got serious after a while, and I saw Kelly suck me like Wendy did, the two of them making love to my cock. They teased me, dragging it out, Kelly showing Wendy how to slow me down, making it last. 

 "Ride him," Kelly said softly. 

 Wendy climbed up and straddled me, then slid down on my cock. She only stayed in the saddle for a short while, no more than a minute or so, then they were both sucking me again. Kelly giggled. "You taste good on him." 

 Wendy nodded. "I know. I'm such a dummy. I could have been doing this forever." 

 "Again?" Kelly teased. 

 Wendy rode me again, reverse cowgirl, and I had to warn her off. "I'm getting close." 

 "Come for me," she gasped, pounding her pussy down on my staff. 

 I hammered away at her for a little longer, until it became too much. "Now!" I gasped. 

 After the first shot, she rose up, and my second shot splashed against her pussy. She leaned back laying on my chest. Kelly's mouth took over on my cock, missing a spurt before I finished in her mouth. She cleaned me, then I heard Wendy gasp, when Kelly redirected her attention. 

 "Do you like that?" I said softly, holding my amazing wife. 

 "Oh, yeah," she moaned. 

 The mouth was back on me, sucking, licking, cleaning me completely. I moaned when I saw Wendy pull her legs apart, and Kelly's head moved back up, dealing with Wendy. 

 Kelly climbed up on Wendy, making a sandwich out of her, then brought her lips down to my wife's. They stayed that way for an eternity. I had a bird's eye view, and saw the tears in Kelly's eyes when she pulled away. "Thank you," she whispered. 

 Wendy hugged her. I took advantage of the situation and squeezed our teen playmate's buns. 

 It was nice, but they were getting heavy. "Can't...breathe," I teased. 

 Wendy chuckled. "Don't be a pussy, John." 

 They separated, one to each side of me, and I held them. "That was pretty amazing." 

 Wendy giggled. "I know, right? Who would have ever guessed? I honestly didn't think we could get any better." 

 Kelly was clinging to me, kissing my chest. "You both are too good to me," she murmured. 

 "Impossible," I told her, giving her a squeeze. 

 "Wendy? John?" I heard a voice calling out from the hallway. 

 Wendy started to squirm out of my grip, gasping. "Oh shit! I forgot Mom was bringing Jeannie over early!" 

 I laughed, and held her tight, refusing to let her escape, teasing her. 

 "John! Let go!" Wendy squealed, struggling cutely. 

 Kelly giggled, cuddling in close. "Stay, Wendy. Make her jealous." 

 "She's my Mom!" 

 I heard the chuckle from the doorway. "Well. Looks like somebody had a good morning." 

 Wendy buried her face in my shoulder. "I'll get you for this," she whispered, biting me hard. 

 "Good morning, Carol. And yes, it was a very good morning." 

 She came over to the side of the bed, placed Jeannie on my chest. "Somebody's hungry," she said. "Do your duty, daughter." 

 Wendy was blushing heavily, when she rolled over and sat up, pulling our baby to her breast. "Mom! I can't believe you're in here. We're naked!" 

 Carol laughed. "Nothing I haven't seen before." She kicked her shoes off, and climbed up behind Kelly. "Room for one more? Ed's going to be so jealous, when I tell him about this." 

 Kelly rolled over and gave my mother-in-law a hug. "You're overdressed for this bed, Mom." 

 Carol laughed. "Oh no. Ed would kill me." 

 Kelly sat up, and started pulling on her shirt. "Come on, get comfy. We're done playing for now. It's just cuddle time." 

 "Kelly!" Wendy snapped. 

 Carol chuckled, and let Kelly remove her shirt. "He's not going to want to see this old body, with you two here." 

 "Are you kidding?" I laughed. "You're hot, Carol." 

 She fought a little more against Kelly removing her pants, but eventually yielded to the inevitable. Laying there in her bra and panties, I couldn't help but hope that Wendy looked as good twenty years from now. "This is embarrassing, Kelly," Mom whispered. 

 "Come here, beautiful, give us a hug," I told her. 

 She cuddled up against me, her arm around my chest, her leg over mine. "You kids are bad. Were you planning on spending the whole day in bed? It's almost 11:00." 

 Kelly snuggled in behind her, kissing her shoulder. "I told you, it's cuddle time. We're going shopping in a bit." 

 Jeannie was feeding contentedly, while Wendy watched. "I'm telling Dad on you," she told her mother. 

 "What? That I cuddled with our favorite son-in-law?" 

 "Naked son-in-law." Wendy said. 

 "Don't be mean, baby," Carol said. "It's not like I sucked him off." 

 "Carol..." I said, warningly. 

 "Like she has room to talk. I'm not doing anything wrong." 

 Wendy smirked. "Boyfriend rule, John. Tell her. Would you do that in front of Dad?" 

 Carol laughed, rose up and kissed me on the lips. "This and more. He'd be so jealous. Maybe I should call him. He'd just die to see your little teen playmate in the raw." 

 "Me? With you two here?" Kelly laughed. 

 "Yes you. Little hard-body vixen. Do you ever wear clothes?" 

 Kelly giggled. "Not if I can help it." 

 Carol's hands were active, rubbing up and down my body. "Damn, baby girl. Your man is a hunk." 

 Kelly's hand joined hers. "That's what I keep telling her. Nice, right?" 

 Wendy was shaking her head. "Who are you, and what have you done with my mother?" 

 "I'm a woman too, baby girl. I wasn't always a grandmother." 

 "GILF," Kelly said. 

 "GILF?" Carol asked. 

 "Grandma I'd love to fuck," the teen giggled. 

 "Aren't you the naughty one!" Carol laughed. 

 Wendy moved Jeannie to the other breast. "This is perverted, you know." 

 Carol leaned up on one elbow. "I'm just playing with you, Wendy. It's just, you know, exciting, to see three beautiful people laying around naked after sex. You surprised me, that's all." 

 Wendy chuckled. "We surprised you?" 

 "I'll leave if it bothers you too much. I just couldn't resist, and then your wild playmate had to go crazy." 

 I decided to keep out of it. I was happy enough to lay there, holding my mother-in-law, watching my beautiful wife tend to our daughter. 

 "Dad would have a cow," Wendy said. 

 "No. He'd be jealous. You really don't know much about me and your father as lovers. Trust me. He'd love to be here with us." 

 Wendy blushed strongly. "Too weird Mom. I don't even want to think about it." 

 Carol pouted. "He's a man. You and Kelly are beautiful, and he loves to see me have fun. Just not too much, we have our limits." She gasped, looking over her shoulder. "Kelly!" 

 Kelly laughed, and I saw her pulling Carol's bra off. "We'll leave the panties. I had to wear mine the first time." 

 Wendy looked on in surprise. Then she looked a little lower. "Damn it, John! You're not getting hard for my mother, are you?" 

 I blushed. I really wanted to stay out of it, but my body betrayed me. "I can't help it, baby. Every time I look at her, I think of you twenty years from now. I'm going to love growing old with you." 

 "Who are you calling old?" Carol teased, poking me. 

 "Not old, older. Shit Carol, you're gorgeous." 

 She blushed, kissing me again. "And you're sweet. My girl is so lucky." 

 My wife wasn't done with me yet. "Didn't you get enough this morning?" 

 I chuckled. "Like I'll ever get enough of you." 

 Kelly climbed over Carol, settling between my legs. "Can I take care of him?" she asked, looking up at my wife. 

 "Shit, why not? We're all going to Hell anyway," Wendy sighed. "Just a blowjob!" 

 Carol scooted away a bit. "I...I probably shouldn't be here if you're going to do that. Ed wouldn't mind the cuddling and teasing, but that's a little much." 

 "I thought you said he liked you to have fun?" Wendy teased her mother. 

 "He does. But I don't push any boundaries behind his back. Watching you guys have sex would be going too far." 

 "Give him a call. You said you were going to," Wendy smirked. "Or were you just bull-shitting me?" 

 Carol glared at her, then sat up. She climbed off the bed, retrieving her purse. I watched her pull out her cell-phone. 

 "Ed?...Yeah, I'm at Wendy's, you won't believe what I walked into...No, the three of them in bed naked..." She laughed, then smiled sweetly at Wendy, who was looking on in shock. 

 "They're about to go at it again, at least Kelly and John are." She listened for a second. 

 She turned to me, putting her hand over the phone. "You two aren't fucking yet, are you? Just blowjobs?" 

 Kelly stopped kissing around my shaft. "That's all. And only with her approval." 

 She returned to the phone. "No. Just a BJ. Would you mind very much if I stayed and watched?...No, I'll be good, I promise...Just watching, I swear...Ok, I'll tell you everything...What do you think I should wear?...How about just my panties?...Yes, I promise...I love you too, dear. You're the best. Want to talk to Wendy?...Ok, I'm handing her the phone." 

 Carol grinned, leaning over me, her tits brushing across my face, while she passed her daughter the phone. 

 Wendy handled the thing like it was a poisonous snake. "Dad?...Yeah, we were laying here when she walked in...Dad!...No, it was after, we were just cuddling...No, I guess it's Ok...Kind of weird." She giggled, and stuck her tongue out at her mother. 

 "Alright, I'll make sure...I know, it's just kind of a surprise, you know?...Alright, Kelly's working on him now...No, just blowjobs, at least for now...Ok, I promise...I love you too." She handed her mother the phone, and Carol's tits caressed my face once more. 

 "I'll be good," Carol promised, speaking into the phone. "Love ya. I owe you one." 

 Wendy sighed. "Can you get me a burping towel, Mom?" 

 Carol sat up and slid off the bed. She returned in a minute with a cotton towel. "Want me to do it? I don't mind, since I can't play, only watch. You can help your friend." 

 "I don't know, Mom. It's kind of bizarre," Wendy said cautiously, looking down at Kelly who was still teasing me. She hadn't taken me in her mouth yet. 

 "Any stranger than a teenager blowing your husband in front of both of us? Go ahead. Have fun." 

 Wendy got up and walked around the bed, delivering our girl to her mother. Carol laid the towel over her shoulder, then rested Jeannie against it, rubbing and patting her back gently.  

 

 

===

Wendy climbed down beside Kelly, and I got a replay of our earlier fun. After a few minutes Kelly told her to ride me. 

 "Kelly..." Wendy whined. 

 "Go ahead. We're going to be here a while. We might as well have fun." 

 Wendy blushed, but climbed aboard. She took a few seconds to get me in her, then she was sliding up and down my cock. She looked over at her mother, blushing. 

 "Don't be embarrassed, baby. He's your man. It's the most natural thing in the world," Carol said. "It's beautiful." 

 I reached down and grabbed Wendy's butt, to help her, and I saw her wince. "Gentle," she murmured. 

 "Sorry, I forgot." 

 She pulled off of me, and moments later she and our playmate were licking me clean, before taking turns sucking me again. 

 Carol laughed. "You, John Reed, are one lucky man." 

 I nodded. "I know. Believe me." 

 After two more sucking sessions, followed by short rides, Carol got up. "I'm putting her down, she's practically asleep already. Don't finish before I get back." 

 "No danger of that," I assured her. 

 Wendy sat up, giving me the evil eye. "You don't think we could finish you before she returns?" 

 I shook my head. "I know you could. Whenever you want. I'm helpless with either of you." 

 Wendy appeared mollified. "You bet your ass we could. Right Kelly?" 

 "Whenever we want to," she replied. 

 I nodded. "I know. I figured you weren't about to cut the play time short, that's all." 

 Wendy moved back to licking and sucking. "As long as you remember. This is our cock, and it shoots when we want it to." 

 Kelly turned and kissed my wife firmly on the lips. "Your cock. I'm just happy to be allowed to play along." 

 Wendy grinned. "My cock. But ours when we're playing together." 

 Carol returned when Wendy was riding me again. "They are so naughty. Teasing you like that." 

 I grinned. "Not...complaining..." 

 She cuddled up next to me, her head on my shoulder. I put my arm around her, holding her close. She grabbed the hand on her shoulder and moved it down to her tit. Then her hand moved down between her legs, and she moaned softly. 

 Wendy climbed off of me, and Kelly's mouth engulfed me immediately. 

 "Greedy!" Wendy whispered. 

 Kelly had the grace to blush, but she kept sucking. 

 "How long can you guys keep going like this?" Carol asked. 

 Wendy was taking her turn with her mouth full, so Kelly responded. "I don't know. At least 30 minutes or so. We haven't tried for longer, he gets kind of crazy after a while." 

 Carol moaned. "Thirty minutes?" 

 "At least. We've done that to him a bunch of times. I think he went about 40 minutes the first night, maybe longer." 

 "You were torturing me," I reminded her. 

 She laughed, her tongue teasing my shaft below Wendy's mouth. "You could have begged anytime." 

 Carol trembled, and I squeezed her nipple for fun. "Sweet Jesus, he doesn't f...fuck that long, does he?" 

 Wendy pulled off my cock, and passed it to Kelly. "Sure. Longer if he wants. He's very patient with me. We've gone for hours. He just takes a break when he needs to, and uses his talented tongue. He's the best lover in the world, Mom." 

 She was embarrassing me. "We don't do that very often. Fifteen to twenty minutes would be the norm," I admitted. 

 Carol was moaning softly, and I saw her hand was going a mile a minute down below. 

 Wendy looked up from between my legs. "Give him some tit, Mom. He loves that." 

 She shivered. "Oh, baby. I don't know. Do you really think I should? That would be awfully brazen." 

 "Go ahead Mom. He's a tit man. Trust me." 

 Carol scooted up the bed, and guided her tit to my mouth. I nibbled on her nipple, and sucked on it, moaning while the girls continued their assault on my cock. I couldn't see much, but I felt Wendy move up and climb on top of me. "Fuck me, John. Fuck me hard this time," she said. 

 She leaned over me, and I saw her face only a few inches from mine. She was obviously very excited. She lifted her hips, and I pounded up into her, listening to her voice catch, while I sucked on her Mom's tit. 

 Wendy was whimpering sweetly. She gasped, and I figured Kelly was up to no good. "Do it," she growled through clenched teeth. 

 It took a lot out of me, but I fucked her hard, pleased when she got that look of distraction that preceded her coming. She was grunting sweetly, little squeals escaping her lips. She rolled her head back, neck taut, and I felt her coming on my cock. She was driving me crazy. 

 "I'm close," I gasped, relinquishing Carol's nipple. 

 "Not yet," Wendy moaned, thrusting hard against me. 

 "Close," I moaned. 

 My wife, shuddered, then scrambled off my cock. She was barely in time, and when Kelly took me down her throat I moaned around Carol's tit, and exploded. I got a couple of shots off, then the mouths switched places, and I finished with my wife. 

 I almost passed out from the experience, my world going black for a few seconds, then I looked up and Kelly's mouth was pressed against Carol's and I felt her coming, while she whimpered sweetly. Kelly pulled away grinning, and Carol rolled over onto her back, gasping. 

 Wendy crawled up next to me, hugging me. "Spoiled. We spoil you way too much." 

 "God, baby. That was insane," I gasped. 

 She giggled. "You like?" 

 "I'm going to pass out now. Wake me in two days." 

 She laughed, kissing me. "No way, hubby dearest. I expect presents under the tree. You're going shopping, and tonight you're going to take all my holes. It's been way too long." 

 I groaned, while the girls laughed. 

 Kelly was back between my legs, playing lovingly. No chance I was getting hard anytime soon, but she didn't seem to mind. Carol cuddled up to me, opposite her daughter. "Thank you, baby. That was wild." 

 Wendy grinned. "You gonna tell Dad everything?" 

 Carol nodded. "Of course. That little stunt Kelly pulled at the end might earn me a spanking, but I deserve it." 

 "She's trouble. I told you. If Dad's going to spank you, I'll send her over to take half of it." 

 "Wendy!" Kelly whined. 

 Carol shook her head. "I'll keep that in mind. She'll need a chaperone. I wouldn't trust us alone with her. Ed doesn't have the patience or control that studly here shows." 

 Kelly climbed up my body, lying on top of me. "I wasn't bad. I was just sharing," she pouted. 

 "Me either," Carol teased. "I'm just going to share my punishment. Then again, he may just want to fuck my brains out after I tell him everything. I'm not sharing that." 

 I closed my eyes, enjoying the banter, and the feel of all that soft flesh pressed against mine. 

 * * * 

 They let me nap, I guess. I woke alone, and staggered off to the bathroom. After a quick shower and shave, I felt human again. Sore, but human. 

 I got dressed, and went looking for the rest of my family. Kelly was playing on the floor with Jeannie, and Wendy was laying on the couch, belly down. She was wearing a t-shirt and skirt, and the skirt was raised up to her waist, showing her bare bottom. The bruising looked like it hurt, and I felt a little ashamed for hurting her. I walked over and caressed her bare butt. 

 "How's it feeling?" I asked. 

 She grinned. "Mom brought over the good stuff. It's only a little sore now. God, I hope I don't earn another one of those anytime soon." 

 I caressed her cheeks gently. "I don't imagine you will. I think you know better now." 

 She shook her head. "Not from that. That will never happen again. But I know I'm sometimes naughty. Be patient with me." 

 I laughed, leaning down and kissing her bare flesh. "Always. It will never be that harsh again, I'm pretty sure of that. I don't believe you'll ever do anything nearly that bad." 

 "Never. I promise." She wiggled her butt. "Am I still forgiven?" 

 "Of course. I love you, sweetie." 

 "I know. I'm still sore somewhere else, too. Not that I'm complaining," she giggled. 

 I crawled over to Jeannie and Kelly, and played with my daughter. "When do you want to go?" I asked Kelly. 

 "Anytime. Whenever you want." 

 "Ok. Let me have a little time with my girl, and we can head out. Any place particular, or is the mall good enough?" I asked. 

 "Sounds perfect," Kelly answered. 

 * * * 

 I'm not much of a shopper. I usually know what I want, and where I want to get it. I go in the store, buy it, and move on. I was having a little more trouble making decisions that day. I knew I wanted to get Carol something special for all she'd done, and I was torn over how much I wanted to get Kelly. I was tempted to go hog wild, but held back a little. I had no idea if my wife had gotten anything for her yet. 

 I knew the big item was a car. We'd have to get Kelly one if she were to be saddled with babysitting responsibilities, as well as going to school. A nice simple used car, good gas mileage. No use spoiling her. As a start, I got an assortment of study guides for the GED, the SAT and ACT. Poor girl was going to be busy. 

 By the time I was content with my purchases, without going overboard as I was so tempted to do, I'd only been there about 2 hours. I loaded my stuff in the vehicle, and returned to the mall rendezvous point, near the food court. 

 I was watching the eye candy, and comparing it negatively to what I had at home. I saw a shapely figure walking my way, and by the time I realized it was Marie, Tom's wife, it was too late to hide or pretend I hadn't seen her. She was looking right at me, and walking my direction in a determined fashion. 

 Ever since the day after her party, I'd avoided talking to her. I was a little embarrassed because I had told her I'd call her back. I felt that it was Wendy's job now, she was her best friend. 

 She walked up with a hard smile on her face. "John Reed, I have a bone to pick with you." 

 "You look gorgeous as always," I replied, trying to deflect the attack. "Last minute shopping?" 

 She sat at the table I was using, and helped herself to a piece of the hot pretzel I was eating. "You never called me back." 

 No getting out of it. "Sorry. I figured Wendy would. I'm surprised she didn't." 

 "What were all those..." she lowered her voice, looking around, "cheating questions about?" 

 I figured the best thing was to try to keep somewhere close to the truth without giving away too much. "Her sister was putting some crazy ideas in her head, it seems. Like blowjobs aren't really sex." 

 "Jesus. Really? Why?" she asked. 

 A good question, and one I hadn't raised yet. "I don't know, to be honest. I think part of it was probably their high-school and college behavior. It might have been mischief, or a joke. Either way I wanted to nip it in the bud. I guess you can understand that." 

 "Why the issue with Tom then? I know you guys haven't spoken since that night. You sounded pissed at him when we talked." 

 Crap. "He might have been one of the guys, and there were more than one, that was trying to convince her that her sister was right." 

 Marie looked at me in shock. "You're kidding right? My Tom did that?" 

 "I hold you largely responsible, you know." 

 Her mouth dropped open. "Me? Why? I didn't do anything!" 

 "It appears that you ladies have been discussing very personal elements of our love lives, and sharing them with your spouses. I don't understand that. Wendy has never told me about your sex lives. Any of yours." 

 Marie blushed. "I...I never thought, I mean, it didn't mean anything. Believe me John, it was nothing bad. Just the opposite. We're all kinds of jealous of what you have." 

 "Maybe, but telling all the men at a party that my wife likes giving blowjobs isn't the smartest thing you've ever done. You know she's kind of naive and a silly drunk. You're not doing her any favors." 

 "But I didn't tell anyone but Tom!" 

 "And of course you swore him to secrecy, and he'd never mention it. Not while drinking and entertaining his buddies. Jesus, Marie! I heard it from guys at work!" Best defense is a good offense, right? 

 "Oh God! You don't think he said anything, do you?" 

 "Somebody did. I heard about it at the party, and at the office. Not the most pleasant evening at home after that. How'd you like your love life to be the subject of water cooler humor, and party gossip." 

 She had an odd look on her face. "If it was yours..." she mumbled. She caught herself, blushing hard again. "All the women know. It could have been any one of them. Do you know it was Tom?" 

 "No. But I suspect it was. I know he talked to one of the guys I work with about it. I'm not very happy about that." 

 "He wouldn't! I can't believe that! We're best friends. Why would he do that? It doesn't make any sense." 

 "I don't know. Maybe you and Wendy should have a talk sometime. Until I know differently, I'm going to have a hard time socializing with your husband." 

 "I'm so very sorry, John. I don't know how it could happen. We talk about all kinds of things, you know. I didn't think. I'll talk to Wendy. You're right about that. I'm going to get to the bottom of this." 

 I saw her look over my shoulder in surprise, and a pair of skinny arms wrapped around me. "Mmm. I'm telling. Talking to a pretty lady when you're supposed to be shopping. Wendy's going to kill you!" 

 I laughed, grabbing her arms and pulling her to the side. "I doubt that. Kelly, this is Marie, Wendy's best friend." I looked across the table at the surprised woman. She was in for a lot of shocks today. 

 "Marie, this troublemaker is Kelly, Wendy's cousin. She'll be staying with us for a while, so she can go to school locally. She'll also be working as our nanny." 

 Kelly pulled her assortment of shopping bags around the side of the table, and sat down, quickly grabbing all that remained of my pretzel. "Second cousin, really. Mom and Carol are cousins, whatever that makes us. So you're Marie, Tom's wife." 

 Marie looked back and forth between us. "I...uh...yeah, you know about me?" 

 Kelly laughed, grabbing my soda and taking a drink. "Sure. Wendy and I talk about everything. Ev-ery-thing. I know all about you." She let that hang a few seconds, then smiled. "Good stuff. She likes you a lot." 

 Marie shook her head. "I'm not so sure about that. We used to talk almost every day. I haven't spoken to her since after the party. She's dodging my calls." 

 Kelly reached out and grabbed her hand. "No, she wouldn't avoid you. She's been bad for the last week, almost completely incommunicado. I guess I'm mostly responsible for that. She's been busy helping me get relocated, setting up my room, getting my schooling set up, all kinds of things. Wendy's the best, but I've been hogging her time. When did you call her last?" 

 "Not for a couple of days. I figured she didn't want to talk to me," Marie said. 

 "Until Thursday, things were just too hectic. Call her tonight, I know she'd love to hear from you. She talks about you all the time." 

 Marie seemed relieved. "I'll do that. Thanks. How long are you going to be staying with them?" 

 Kelly shrugged. "I've got years of schooling ahead of me. I've got no pride. I'll mooch off of them as long as they'll keep me." 

 "Kelly!" I scolded. "It's not mooching, you're family. Hell, you're more than paying your way. Built in babysitter, nanny, cook, and housekeeping help is doing a lot. It's not like we don't have plenty of space." 

 Kelly leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. Her hand, under the table also gave me a naughty rub. "You both are so good to me. I don't know what I'd do without you." 

 Marie stood, grabbing her one shopping bag. "I'm glad we had this talk, John. I'm sorry I snapped at you. Forgiven?" 

 I stood and gave her a hug, thankful that Kelly's little grope didn't have the full effect it might have. "Always. You know you're my favorite, don't you?" 

 She grinned, and I was a little surprised when she pressed back against me firmly. "I've always suspected. Especially around pool season." 

 I laughed, swatting her rear playfully. "Your smokin' hot body has nothing to do with it, and you know it. You're a great friend." I gave her a long look. "Most of the time." 

 She stood on tip-toe and gave me a quick kiss. "You best let me go, you beast, or your boarder will have something to tell on you." 

 I sighed, releasing her. "Spoil sport. Both of you." 

 She gave us a princess wave, and marched off to continue her shopping. I returned to Kelly and started grabbing her bags. 

 "No way, handsome. I'm famished. You need to feed me, or I really am telling!" she giggled. 

 "Jeez. You are nothing but trouble, aren't you?" 

 She gave me a sultry smile. "Nothing? Only trouble? I have no redeeming qualities?" 

 I leaned over and gave her a little PDA. "Maybe a few. What do you want?" 

 "Cheesesteak, no onions, small fries, Coke." 

 "Small fries?" I teased. 

 "Gotta keep the girlish figure. You don't want me getting fat, do you?" 

 I bought what she wanted, and kept her company while she devoured it. She slapped my hand each time I tried to steal a fry. "Ask," she said. 

 "Fry, Angel?" I pleaded. 

 She grinned and fed me one. A small one. Chintzy girl. 

 While eating she begged to borrow my phone. Something else we'd have to get her. She dialed home, and was chatting with Wendy in moments. 

 "Met Marie...uh, huh...You know, cousins, schooling, nanny, all that stuff...I'm pretty sure." 

 I stole another fry, dodging the smack. "She was asking why we never called back after the party," I reminded her. 

 "Yeah, he said she was asking why you guys never called her back...Ok, I'll give him the phone," Kelly said, and then passed it across to me. 

 I gave Wendy the update, what I had said about rumors about her, and Tom's interest in making them come true. 

 "John! Did you have to say that?" she whined. 

 "I had so say something!" I reminded her. "She was asking about the oral sex and cheating questions, and why I was upset with Tom." 

 "Crap. Ok, when you get home we can discuss what we'll say. You coming soon?" she asked. 

 "Just as soon as the bottomless pit finishes her mid-day snack." 

 Kelly put on a pained look. "What? You ate half the fries!" 

 "Four, Kelly. I ate four of the fries," I teased. 

 "Big ones!" 

 "Not hardly. Finish up sweetie, we need to get going." I spoke into the phone. "We're on our way, see you soon. Love ya." 

 "Love you too," she said before hanging up. 

 "That was mean," Kelly pouted. 

 "Not at all. I think it's wonderful you have a good appetite. Keeping your energy up." 

 She grinned mischievously. "Why? You thinking of wearing me out?" 

 I laughed. "Not sure that would even be possible." 

 She giggled. "But wouldn't it be fun trying?" 

 * * * 

 At home, Wendy and I had a discussion about how much we should tell Marie, and reviewed what I'd already told her. Wendy wanted to keep things secret, not wanting to destroy their relationship. Openly confessing that her cheating with Tom would be hard on her best friend. 

 I hated that she'd cheated on me, but I was proud to hear her admit that was what she'd done. I thought about all the things people said when they cheated, particularly 'it was only sex'. My wife had taken it to an all new low, 'it was only a blowjob', not even sex, according to her. Now a week later, thanks to her mother, and our tempting teen, she appeared to have done a complete 180. 

 She looked up in surprise, when I pulled her into my arms. "I love you so much," I told her softly. 

 In spite of that, I was still leaning toward letting the bastard take the heat for what he'd done. Wendy begged to make that a last resort. For Marie's sake, not for the son-of-a-bitch. She still wanted to make things right, so I finally caved, and told her she could handle Marie. 

 I begged off, so I could do some present wrapping, when the girls called out to me from the hall. "You've got baby duty. I just put her down. We have an errand to run. Shouldn't take too long." 

 "Got it. Have fun," I told them. I could use the privacy. I was not the world's best gift wrapper.  

 

 

===

It was a half hour later, when I heard them return. I was stacking the gifts under where our tree should be. Sad to say, with all the craziness, we'd never even put one up yet. One more task to do. 

 I turned to the door, and was surprised as hell to see my sister-in-law Alice standing in the doorway, nervously. "John," she said softly in greeting. "Can I talk to her? Please?" 

 I walked to the door, and waved her inside. "She should be back any moment. We need to keep it down, Jeannie's napping." 

 "I could come back later," she said. 

 "Please, come on in. Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink?" I was trying hard to be my most gentlemanly. I wanted her to stay. I had some things I needed to talk about. 

 She was scared. It was easy to detect. "Wine maybe?" 

 We had an open bottle. Seems like we often did lately. I poured her a glass, and grabbed myself a Guinness, pouring it into one of my chilled mugs. I brought her the drink, and sat down next to her. She was practically trembling. 

 I'll give her credit though. She had showed up, and I guess she was ready to face the music. I hoped that she'd be honest. 

 "Relax, Alice. I'm not going to bite." 

 She leaned back in the seat, watching me warily. 

 "Can I ask you one simple question?" 

 She took a bracing gulp of her wine, then nodded. 

 "Why? Why would you do that to her? Do you hate her that much? Were you purposely trying to destroy our marriage? I thought we got along pretty well." 

 She had tears in her eyes when she responded. "God, no, John! I don't hate her at all. She's my baby sister. I love you guys." 

 "Can you explain why?" 

 "I...I screwed up, Ok? I didn't mean for it to happen. I never thought it would turn out that way, I swear." 

 "No, it's not Ok. How could you go out of your way to convince my wife that it was alright to give anyone a blowjob? That it wouldn't be cheating?" 

 She was shaking. "Please," she whined. "I'll try to fix it. I feel horrible about the whole thing." 

 "Why, Alice? Why'd you do it?" 

 "She hasn't told you?" 

 "No. She still thinks you've got her best intentions in mind. Trying to get her to divorce me. Trying to break us up. I...I would never have expected that of you." 

 She bowed her head down, clutching her glass between her hands tightly. "I was scared. I had to protect my own marriage. We're not as strong as you guys. I knew you'd be Ok, no matter what." 

 "You still haven't explained why." I said it softly, putting my hand on her shoulder. "I need to know." 

 "She...she saw me." The words were so soft I almost missed them. 

 "Saw you?" 

 She nodded. "With Miguel." 

 "Our handyman?" 

 Another faint nod. "She was upset. Wanted to know how I could do that. I was so scared she'd say something and Dan would find out. I told her it was no big thing. Only a blowjob. Like in high-school and college. What we did to avoid putting out. It was a way to avoid cheating." 

 "Why would you do that? Risk your marriage like that?" 

 "It was idiotic, I know. Dan and me, we don't have what you guys have. I get it maybe once a week. Maybe. I hear her talking about your sex life and it drives me crazy. I get so worked up. Miguel was there, working outside with his shirt off, dark skin shining. His shorts were tight, and I saw this big bulge. I tease him a lot, and that day he grabbed me. I don't know why, maybe I'd teased him once too often. The timing was horrible. I'd been on the phone with Wendy just a little while earlier, and she was talking about sucking your cock morning noon and night, you remember, a couple of weeks after Jeannie was born. When he pushed me to my knees, God, John! I felt so wicked. Outside, fully dressed, being made to suck cock. Fuck, I was dripping." 

 She took another sip of her wine. "I have no excuse, really. I knew I shouldn't do it. I guess I was trying to convince myself the same thing. It was like back in school. A blowjob. That's all. I wouldn't let him touch me. He wouldn't get between my legs. Just a blowjob. I was horny as shit, but I wasn't about to cheat on Dan. I'd just give the guy a blowjob." 

 I waited her out, silent. 

 "I did it. He didn't even make me do it. I opened his pants, and pulled out his big cock. That's what it was, a big, heavy cock. Bigger then Dan's. Thicker. Hard, because of me." She sobbed, "I fucked up, so bad. I sucked him. Not in the bedroom, but outside, on the deck, in broad daylight. I sucked that fat cock, and I loved the fact that he was moaning, and saying things in Spanish. Bad things, I just knew it. I was so worked up, I almost came just from sucking him." 

 Alice put her glass down, turning more toward me. "Lousy fucking timing. That's what it was. Wendy walked out of the back door, practically yelling my name. I was about to pull away, but the bastard had his hand on my head, and he pushed it back into my mouth, holding my head while he fucked my mouth a few more times, until he came. I didn't fight it. I couldn't. Even when he went off in my mouth, I didn't turn away. I took it. It was so...so dirty. Wicked. I sucked him dry, and he was standing there, smiling at my sister." 

 "The fucker pulled up his shorts, rubbed my head like a dog, and walked back out to the yard. That's when she confronted me, and I explained that it was only a blowjob. No big deal. It wasn't like I cheated. He didn't even touch me." 

 "It only took a couple of weeks to get her to accept that it was only a blowjob. Not sex. Not cheating. I felt guilty but I was trying to save my marriage." 

 "At the expense of ours." 

 "No! Never! She never wanted anyone but you. There's no way she'd do it with anyone else. She had you for all her blowjobs. You never denied her. We all knew. All she had to do was touch your zipper, and you were hard for her. Why would she ever go to anyone else?" 

 "Until she did." 

 The waterworks started up again. "How could I know that mother-fucker Tom would use the same exact tactics. 'C'mon, Wendy. It's only a blowjob. It's not like you're really cheating.' Damn him!" 

 She looked up at me. "Yeah, she told me. Right after she did it. She was even going to tell you, but I told her we had to keep it a secret. It wasn't really cheating, but Marie would get upset, since she doesn't give him any." She grabbed my hand. "I'm so sorry, John. I swear I never thought in a million years she'd do it." 

 "I think I started to believe it a little myself. I had told myself I'd just do it that once. It was a mistake, but never again. Fuckin' Miguel didn't think so. He'd be working on something, then he'd take a break. He walked right up to me in the kitchen, with his dick out, grabbed me by my shoulders and pushed me to my knees. I'm such a stupid slut, I'd go right along with it. Give him my very best BJ, then go back to the dishes, without ever saying a word. The next time Wendy caught me, she just sat back and watched. She even gave me advice." 

 "She watched you? Is that all she did? Did she blow him too?" 

 Alice shook her head rapidly. "No. No way. The worst she ever did was give him a handjob for a few seconds, when I took a phone call. That was only once." 

 Fuck me with a crowbar. "She gave him a handjob?" 

 "Not really. It was only a couple of minutes. He pushed it toward her mouth, but she only laughed and turned away." 

 "Damn it, Alice!" 

 "I...I wasn't thinking, you know? By then I really was of the mindset that it wasn't cheating. I pulled him out of my mouth, and I put her hand on his cock. She looked at me a little surprised, and the fucker moaned like her hand was better than my mouth. Wendy blushed, turning her head away, and stroked him slowly, while I spoke on the phone, and as soon I finished I took it back. I was a little pissed. Just her touching it had him so worked up, he shoved his cock in my mouth and came only a few seconds later, looking at her, not me. Last time I gave him a blowjob." 

 "I don't know what to say," I murmured, leaning back into the couch. "Do you know how close I came to ending our marriage? I was so angry, if she hadn't gotten in the car with me, I would have driven to a motel and started the divorce papers that Monday. I was devastated. If I didn't have a new daughter to consider, I don't believe I'd have let her back in our home that night." 

 Alice had pulled her knees up to her chest, and she was rocking, her cheeks tear strained. "I'm sorry. I never meant for any of that to happen." 

 "What have you told Dave?" I asked. 

 "Nothing. I'm scared to death. I know he's going to find out now. Six times I did it. Six times, each a nail in the coffin of my marriage. No way he'll ever forgive me." She looked up at me. "I'm terrified. I don't know what to do." 

 If I had heard this that first weekend, all the pain and humiliation tearing away at me, I shudder to think what I might have done to her. Selfish little cheater, convincing my wife into thinking blowjobs were Ok, and making a mockery of my marriage. 

 Now I looked at her with a good deal more pity than I should have had. I should have laughed in her face. Called Dan myself. Tell her she deserved it, and more. 

 Instead, I leaned over, picked her up off the couch and set her on my lap, holding her. "You really messed things up, didn't you?" I told her softly. 

 She nodded, turning her head into my shoulder, sobbing out of control. I held her, stroking her hair reassuringly. "This is the last time, you understand? I can't have you sabotaging my marriage again. I'll accept this was a mistake, and you regret it, but I'm not happy with you Alice. Not just the blowjob either. You made my wife give another man a handjob. You made a cheater out of her, directly. I'm very angry with the both of you right now." 

 "What am I going to do, John? Have I destroyed my life, my marriage? I'm so lost." 

 She was looking at me in obvious anguish. I brushed her tears away, softly. "I don't know. I wish I could help you. I'd suggest you get together with your mother and sister, and hash this out. Your Mom's a smart cookie. You three have to decide whether it's better to come clean, or try to bury it, and let you suffer with the guilt, for the sake of your relationship. I'm willing to go along with whatever you three decide." 

 She leaned her head against my shoulder, snuggling in. "Why are you being like this? I thought you were going to tear my head off. I deserve it." 

 "It's done. I believe you, that you regret it, and trust that it won't happen again. I hope you've learned your lesson. If you get Wendy involved in anything like that again, I'll do my best to destroy you, family or not. Once, and only once, I'll forgive you." 

 "Why are you being so nice to me? You were terrible to Wendy! You almost destroyed her. I can't believe you brought a whore home and made my sister watch the slut suck you." 

 I felt my anger resurging. "You should shut up when you're ahead, you selfish little bitch. I wasn't destroying my wife. I was trying to save her, save us. You really had her convinced that blowjobs didn't matter, and that she wasn't cheating. Nothing I said, nothing her friends said, even her mother, could convince her otherwise. No, I was the bastard for making a big deal out of her sucking our friends. She even stood up for them. So I showed her. Made her see what a blowjob from someone else was like. Still, she clung to the idea that she'd never cheated. She had no idea what she'd done to us, to me. It wasn't until she spent a day with that 'whore', undoing the damage that you did, that Wendy finally understood. That was all I wanted." 

 I grabbed her chin and made her look me in the eyes. "You and your cheating selfish cover-up almost destroyed my marriage. That 'slut', that 'whore' as you like to call her, saved it. She didn't need to, she had nothing vested, she wasn't family. Just a hurting, lost 18 year old in desperate straits. She went out of her way to prevent me from making things worse, and together with your mother, undid your damage, and perhaps made us even stronger." 

 I glared at her, my hand tensing. It was probably painful for her. "I forgave you. I do. But if you ever say anything bad about Kelly, you will never be welcome in my house, or anywhere around me again. Do you understand?" 

 In spite of my hand on her chin, she nodded. I released her, and gave her a kiss on the cheek. "No more talk about that, Ok? I can get very upset, still." 

 "I...I didn't know, Jim. I'm sorry. How could I know? Nobody's talking to me. They won't take my calls. They won't let me in the house. You're the first one that's given me the time of day, and I hurt you the worst. I'm so confused right now." 

 I hugged her to my chest. "I know you are. It'll get worse before it gets better. They'll talk to you tonight. You may not like it, but they will. At least Wendy will. I imagine your mother will, as well." 

 My cell phone chose that time to ring, and I picked it up, still hanging onto Alice. "Hey, baby," I said, recognizing her number. 

 "We're on our way. Need us to pick up anything?" 

 "Nope. I just need you. Desperately." 

 She laughed. "You had me. And had me, and had me, and had me. Aren't you getting a little tired of your old wife?" 

 "Never. I love you." 

 "Alright, enough sappiness. Keep it up and I won't be able to drive. See you in a couple of minutes." 

 I hung up when she did, and put the phone to the side. "Finish your wine," I told Alice. 

 She looked nervous as she drank the last of it down. I went in and checked on my daughter, who thankfully slept like a rock, as she seemed to do about 18 hours a day. Naw, I wasn't jealous. 

 I returned to Alice. "I'm sorry about this, but you brought it down on yourself. I hope you'll forgive me later." 

 Her forehead wrinkled in confusion. "For what?" 

 I pulled my pants down. I wasn't hard, but I was started to firm up, at the thought. "The handjob you're going to give me." 

 "I will do no such thing!" she gasped. 

 "You will. You forced my wife to give one to a stranger. She never thought to make that little confession when she was telling me who she cheated with. So now she gets to see you give me one." 

 "No, John. Don't do this." 

 "Start, Alice. Right now or I swear to God, I'm on the phone to your husband, and you're out the door forever. Choose." 

 She looked up at me, but it wasn't anger in her eyes. She reached out for my cock, taking it in her hand and tugging on it. It grew firmer in her soft hand. "Do you want me to suck it?" she asked. 

 "No. Let me correct that. Hell no! Not that I wouldn't enjoy your mouth, but we're not going there. I won't betray my wife like that. This is a simple lesson for her. If she's been holding anything else back, there'll be hell to pay." I looked down at her, not mentioning I really didn't like the company I'd be sharing her with, if she did blow me. 

 Alice scooted closer, her face only inches away. I could feel her breath. "She hasn't. I know everything. Tom, Aaron, Jarrod. That's it. Maybe a minute of stroking Miguel's dick. That's the whole of it. Nobody else since you've been engaged." 

 I thought it was interesting that she didn't say since Wendy met me. Only since we'd been engaged. That would be a discussion for another time. 

 In the meantime, I looked down at the architect of so much of our troubles. I tamped down my anger, as her hand slid up and down my cock. She leaned forward and licked my shaft, looking up at me. 

 "Don't Alice," I warned her. 

 She gazed up at me sorrowfully. "I can't suck it, but I need to lube you up a bit, John, that's all." Her words were followed up by some sloppy licking, that turned into something more. She would kiss my shaft, rubbing her cheek against the bulbous head, glance up at me and give it a kiss. "I'm so sorry, John. I'd never want to hurt you." 

 Her hand slowly slid up and down my shaft, her lips still exploring. "Enough, Alice. It's only a handjob," I reminded her. 

 She sounded pitiful as she murmured "I know." 

 I'll say this for the little slut. She gave a handjob like her sister gave a blowjob. The loving attention, the soft touch, the adoring glances, all reminded me of Wendy. I was actually starting to enjoy it, as something other than a vengeful act. I was about to stop her when I heard the car pull into the driveway. 

 "Make it good. It's showtime." 

 ===============================

======================== 

 Family issues and vengeance concerns 

 ======================== 

 I stood over my sister-in-law, whose cheating had caused so much trouble in my marriage. She looked repentant, as she pressed her lips to my leg, her hand stroking my hard cock, her eyes tracking its path. 

 It was still hard for me to believe that my wife had given that low-life bastard a handjob and hid it from me. I had forgiven her, all she had to do was be honest. But no, she was still hiding things. Now she was about to find out that keeping secrets from me was not acceptable. 

 The front door opened, and I turned a little to give them the best view possible. Wendy noticed first. She stood stock still, dropping her bags, I saw a variety of emotions dance across her face. I recognized the understanding. 

 Kelly was only a little behind her, but only one emotion stood out. Anger. Loud and strong. She dropped her bags, and started toward me. "Damn you, John! You bastard..." 

 Wendy caught her by the arm. "No. Stop, Kel. This is my fault." 

 Kelly stopped pulling and looked at her in confusion. "How? Why?" 

 My wife walked over calmly, stopping next to me. She grabbed her sister's hand, and peeled her fingers away. Alice seemed to be resisting. 

 "I'm sorry, John. I swear, I didn't even remember it. It was just the one time, and only for a few seconds," she whispered. 

 "So your cheating is so common, so unimportant, that you can't even remember all the times you've done it?" I snapped, my suppressed anger bursting free. 

 She moved between me and her sister. "Please not like this, John. This is not like you. You were never cruel. Even with Kelly, I understand now, but not this way." 

 "What? You don't like your sister touching me? Does that bother you? Not half as much as you continuing to hide your cheating from me! How many more, Wendy? How many more times can I expect to be surprised?" I reached past her grabbing Alice's wrist. "How much more is she going to have to do, to pay off your treachery." 

 Wendy grabbed my arm tightly. "Not this. Please, John! You have to stop. This isn't right. She doesn't deserve this." 

 "Doesn't deserve it? This is all her fault!" 

 She managed to pull my hand free, and her sister let me go. I let Wendy guide me down to the couch. She turned to Kelly. "Cover him up, please?" 

 Then she sat between me and her sister. "That was a horrible thing to do. She screwed up. I screwed up. But that is way too much. Toying with her like that." 

 "Toying with her? I wanted you to see. See what I'll be imagining forever. You stroking that fucking illegal's cock," I snapped. Kelly was pulling my pants up, getting me to lift up a little. The little tease gave my shaft a kiss, before she tucked it away. I saw the new look of surprise in Alice's eyes. 

 "Not like that. You know how she feels about you. To do that, to lead her on, that was just cruel." 

 "What the fuck are you talking about!" 

 Wendy looked into my eyes, and I saw surprise in hers. "How can you not know? Jesus, John! She's liked you since the first time I brought you home. To tease her like that, make her play with your cock, when she's never going to get it, never going to get you, that's not right." 

 "That's not...I mean...She made you do it to the guy, so I thought you should see her...you should have told me!" 

 She was holding her sister in her arms, and I saw that Alice was crying again. Kelly, always good for a surprise, climbed up on the arm of the couch behind Alice, and hugged her. "I know. Me too. Me too." 

 My sister-in-law just cried louder. Maybe that was what woke up Jeannie. I heard the fussing and then the crying from the monitor. I left the three of them, and retrieved my daughter. She needed a changing, and she'd calmed down by the time I got her cleaned up, dressed, and back in the living room. 

 The crying had stopped, and they were huddled together, whispering. Kelly stood and took my baby girl away from me, and delivered her to Wendy for a meal. "I'm going to go take care of him, Ok?" Kelly said. 

 Wendy nodded, and Kelly turned to Alice. "Call Mom. Use the house phone. Tell her that we said she needed to come over. All three of us. Tell her that." 

 Kelly took me by the hand and guided me back to the master bedroom. She smiled as she took my pants off. "Up, down, up, down. We should make you wear a kilt for easier access." 

 "I...I didn't know, Kelly. I swear." 

 She pushed me back on the bed, slowly undressing. "I know. We all know. You're kind of sweet like that. One track mind for your wife." She took off her shorts, then looked back at me. "Get rid of that shirt." 

 I did, and she climbed onto the bed with me, naked. "Still no fucking, understood?" 

 I nodded. 

 She laid down on top of me, kissing me softly. "You should have talked to her. Not gone about it like that. I thought we were beyond this." 

 "She makes me so angry. I thought she was being honest to me, and then I found out she cheated again! I'm back to wondering how many more. Was she ever faithful?" 

 Kelly hushed me with a soft kiss. "She loves you. She screwed up. You need to accept that for a few weeks, she was an idiot. I believe she completely forgot about whatever she did. Don't you?" 

 "How can she forget about giving another man a handjob?" I could still feel the anger, but Kelly's soft touch and warm body were especially soothing. The little kisses weren't hurting either. 

 "It didn't matter to her. She had no emotions at all vested in it. She wasn't cheating, I'm sure. Not in her mind. Believe me, it's not that hard to get to the point where sex is just a dirty act. Boring and distasteful with someone you have no feelings for. Something to just get done and over." 

 I hugged her to my chest. "I'm sorry, Angel. Sometimes I forget." 

 She squeezed me back. "Damn. I wish I could. God, how I wish I could. Only when I'm with you two, can I let it slip from my mind." Her lips pressed against mine, lingering. "I'm so much worse than her. I've done horrible things. Yet you hold me, love me. Can't you do the same for her?" 

 "She made promises. Vows. She was supposed to be mine, nobody else's. It hurts so bad when I picture her doing those things." 

 Kelly nibbled my lip. "She was bad. For almost 5 weeks. You've forgiven her. This was part of that time. Another stupid mistake. Let's believe she forgot, Ok? Please? I do, I really do. She's not intentionally hiding it." 

 "If there's any more, I don't know what I'll do," I said, anguished. 

 She squeezed me tightly. "We'll talk to her. See if there was anything else. Not just blowjobs. Anything." 

 She sat up, smiling. "How do you want it? On my knees? Maybe I should lay down with my head over the edge, and you can fuck my mouth." She reached down and tugged on my cock, which was no longer hard. "69?" 

 "Can I just hold you a while? She... she hurt me again, Kelly." 

 I saw her tear up a little. "Whatever you want." She got off the bed. "Let's get under the covers Ok? It's kind of cool in here, if we're not doing anything hot." 

 She joined me under the covers, draping herself over my side. "Thank you," she whispered, kissing my shoulder. 

 "For what?" 

 "This. Don't get me wrong now, I really like blowing you. I just know that sex would be incredible. But choosing this? The holding, the closeness. It's the kindest, most wonderful thing you could ever do for me." 

 "I love holding you, Angel. You must know that by now." 

 She climbed on top of me again, wiggling, getting comfortable. "In my heart, I'm starting to believe it. In my head, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It can't last. I don't deserve it. No way. I've got to be hard, ready, for when this all blows up in my face." 

 I held her to my chest, arms wrapped around her. "For the moment, run with your heart. I never want to let you go." 

 "You're married to her." 

 I kissed the side of her face. "I am. I love her. More than anything. I don't want to sound cruel, but she is, well, she's my wife. My first true love. The mother of my child." I loosened my grip on her, and caressed her skin, rubbing her back lightly, letting my hands drift down to her tight little butt. 

 "You have a place in my heart, Kelly. A big one. You won't replace my wife. But I love you, and I will as long as you'll let me. You're a good person, and you have to let yourself believe that. You deserve the best of everything. I swear by all that's holy, I'm going to do my damnedest to make sure you get it." 

 "I want to believe you," she murmured. 

 "You want me to forgive Wendy for everything? Forgive yourself. Do that for me." 

 "I wish I could." 

 "You can. It's a choice. Accept that you did some bad things, made some bad choices. That doesn't make you bad. You're a good person who made some mistakes. Time to forgive yourself, and make better choices." 

 "I'm trying," she answered. 

 "I know. You don't have to go it alone. Lean on me. Me and Wendy. We're your family now." 

 She nodded. 

 We didn't speak anymore, and I kept my caresses PG, until I realized she was sleeping on my chest. 

 I was awake, thinking, when Wendy opened the door. She looked in on us, and smiled. "You wore her out?" 

 I put my fingers to my lips, and beckoned her closer. "Talked and cuddled, that's all," I said softly when she was lying next to me. 

 "I'm sorry about Miguel. That was the only time, and I didn't do that with anyone else. I swear, John, it slipped my mind. It didn't matter to me. I know it should have, but I was thinking screwy there for a bit. I'm so sorry." 

 "I know. I overreacted. I... I still have some anger. We'll get past it. I'll do better. I'm sorry, too. I should have talked with you. That was totally wrong on my part." 

 She kissed me. "We'll be perfect. The envy of every couple. I know you love me, and I hope you know I love you more than anything. I hate what I've done to us, but I'll make it up to you." She reached out and rubbed her hand down Kelly's narrow back. "Hang onto her a bit. Mom's here, and the three of us need some time. I'll come for her when she's needed." 

 She gave me another quick kiss, and stood up. She was about to say something, then stopped. 

 I smiled. "What? What were you going to say? The rules? You know I won't break them." 

 She nodded. "Yep. I still get a little jealous. Then I see the look you have, and I know I can trust you. Absolutely. If you wanted to do more, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?" 

 I laughed softly. "She's a beautiful, sexy young girl, naked in my bed. You're awfully trusting, aren't you?" 

 She crawled back on the bed, kissing me softly, then more passionately. She pulled away after a bit. "If that did what I think it did to you, remember, oral only." She grinned. "There. Now do you feel better?" 

 She climbed off the bed. "And yes. I'm very trusting. Absolutely. You'd never hurt me. Even that crap with Alice. I understand, and I probably had it coming. A handjob is cheating too, and I'll never do it for anyone but you. Message delivered." 

 I hated to ask, but I couldn't help myself. "Is there anything else I need to know about the last couple of months?" 

 She shook her head. "I don't think so, but later we'll sit down and I promise, I'll try to go over everything I did that was in any way questionable, alright? I don't need any more surprises either." 

 I nodded. "You better go now, or your Mom might end up back here looking for us." 

 Wendy grinned. "Last thing we need is for her to climb in there with you. You are a lot of trouble, you know that?" 

 "Hey! That wasn't my fault." 

 "No. The rotten girl in your arms was the big instigator, but she's your responsibility. You're the one that brought her in this house." 

 "You regret that now?" I asked softly. 

 "No. Maybe the smartest thing you ever did. But I still get to hold it over you. Wife's prerogative." She grinned, blew me a kiss, and left. 

 Kelly woke after a while, and gave me a sleepy little kiss. I returned it, with a little more intensity. Before long we were making out like teenagers, lying on our sides, facing each other, hands misbehaving. 

 I put her on her back, and worshiped her young soft body. I worked my way down, until I was between her legs. At the first touch of my tongue, she moaned. I licked and sucked where I could, teasing her, building her pleasure. I loved the way she responded. At her first small orgasm, I started using my fingers on her, and it didn't take me long to get her off again, harder. I didn't relinquish my hold on her, and trembled when I felt her fingers in my hair, guiding me, holding me down, as her hips pressed up against me. 

 She was pretty quiet until then, but started to get a little louder, moaning sweetly, talking to me, begging me not to stop. Her third one was big, her entire body tensing, thighs squeezing against my head, fingers pulling on my hair. She pulled a pillow over her face and cried out into it, her hips moving violently, first against me, then trying to get away. I had a good grip on her, and kept her where I needed her, as her orgasms continued unabated. 

 At the second barely muffled scream I started to bring her down gently, abandoning her clit, and licking the inside of her thighs gently. When her trembling ceased, she pushed my head away gently, tossing the pillow aside. She rose up on her elbows, peering down at me. "Wow," she said, smiling. "That was amazing." 

 I wiped my face on the sheets, then climbed up on top of her, kissing her small breasts before I got to her lips. "You liked?" 

 "Liked? That was the best ever. Ev-er." 

 "Don't tease me." 

 "Tease? You teased the crap out of me. I loved every minute of it. I... I didn't think it could be like that. God, you're driving me crazy, John!" She kissed me hard. "I need to tell Wendy, Ok? That wasn't just a blowjob, or cuddling. I have to let her know, or I'll feel like shit. I'm already feeling guilty." 

 "Of course. No secrets." 

 "You think she might let you do that again?" 

 I laughed, hugging her. "We can ask, right?" 

 She leaned back in the bed, rolling her head from side to side. "Wow," she whispered. 

 She looked around and noticed it was getting dark out. "Shit, how long have we been in here?" 

 "A few hours." 

 "Mom come over?" she asked, climbing on top of me, like I was her personal jungle gym. 

 "Yeah, they're talking it out. Wendy said she'd come for you." 

 Kelly gave me a wicked grin. "I bet you'd like to see that." 

 "You know what I mean, devil girl." 

 She chuckled then kissed me. "Behave. Someone down there is looking for a home, and no way it's going to slip into the wrong one." Another quick kiss. "Besides, I thought I was your Angel." 

 "You are." 

 "Can I blow you now? At least until they come looking for me?" 

 "I wouldn't have it any other way." 

 She smirked. "Tired of just holding me? Now I'm a plaything?" 

 "I doubt I'll ever tire of holding you, but you did offer..." 

 "I did. It's time, buster. That big cock is mine." 

 She was wonderful, as always. Got me off pretty quickly the first time. Then she took her time, playing, teasing, driving me crazy, endlessly, until I was begging her for release. She was torturing me. 

 Wendy came looking for us, and watched for a bit. "Finish him, rotten thing. Time for you to join the fray." 

 Kelly lifted up. "Wanna help?" 

 Wendy shook her head. "I gotta go back out there to make sure Mom doesn't kill Alice. She's angrier than all of us. I might even have to recruit hubby to calm her down. Stop torturing my man, and then both of you get decent and join us." 

 Kelly was still being evil, and wouldn't give me my release for a few more minutes. 

 "Please!" I pleaded. "Begging, I'm begging." 

 She finally acquiesced, and looked up at me, while I filled her saucy mouth for the second time. I saw her glance over at the clock. "Cool. I get to tell Mom you can keep it up for 56 minutes." She licked my shaft naughtily. "I was going for an hour. You should have let me." 

 "Another time. We've got company, devil girl." 

 She pouted. "Angel! I'm your Angel." 

 I laughed, and pulled her up for a hug and kiss. "Yes you are. I love my little Angel. Now get decent before we go out there." 

 She stood and went into Wendy's closet, pulling out a yellow sundress. She slipped it on. "Ta-da!" 

 "Panties?" 

 "No way. I'm feeling too wicked tonight." She turned to the bathroom. "You just gonna lay there and watch me? You walk out there like that, and you'll be eaten alive." 

 I got up, and grabbed my boxers. "Behave." 

 She was brushing her hair, grinning at me. "Might be kind of fun to see what happened if you did. Wife, mother and sister. That would be pretty epic." 

 "Behave!" I snapped playfully. 

 She stuck her tongue out at me. "Alright. For a while. But tonight I'm definitely going to misbehave, once we've ditched the other two." 

 She came over and gave me a quick kiss. "Don't be long." 

 Wicked girl. 

 * * * 

 My part was simple. They were seated around the dining room table, and you could cut the tension with a knife. I went to Carol first, leaning over and giving her a hug and kiss. "Thanks so much for coming over and refereeing. You're the best." 

 She seemed to calm down a bit. "You didn't need to get involved. I promised you we'd take care of it." 

 "I know," I explained. "There were just some questions I had to ask for myself, when she showed up, unannounced. That was all. The rest I'll leave in your capable hands. Don't be too harsh on her." 

 I went over to Alice and turned her chair to face me. "I'm sorry about my behavior. I was out of line." 

 She shook her head. "No, John, I was the one out of line. You were reacting. Completely understandable." 

 "Still, I wanted you to know I'm sorry, and that as far as I'm concerned, you're totally forgiven. I know you won't do anything to hurt us again." 

 She shook her head rapidly. "Never, I swear." 

 I leaned down and kissed her softly on the lips. "We'll get through this. All of us, together. You're family, and we all love you." 

 She threw her arms around my neck, hugging me tightly. "Thank you," she whispered. 

 I felt I'd done about all I could. I turned to the table. "There's a big empty place where our Christmas tree should be. I'm going down to the Boy Scout's place and pick out a nice one. I won't be gone too long." 

 "Not too big, this year," Wendy said. "Remember last time." 

 "Don't remind me." I walked over to Kelly and gave her a quick kiss goodbye, then finished with my wife, giving her a reminder of my intentions for later. Her mother was teasing us that they still had things to do before I was finished. 

 * * * 

 I took my time, picking through the sparse leavings. I guess I was lucky to find a tree at all. Seven foot tall blue spruce, with one ugly gap in the branches I was going to hide against the wall. For a moment I wondered if there were rules about babies and live trees. Danger of eating pine needles, that kind of stuff. 

 My life had changed in so many ways in the last few months. 

 Having a child was the obvious one, a cheating wife was a more painful one, a live-in teen blowjob queen the unexpected one. The closer relationship with the mother-in-law was the strange one. Damn, things were getting weird. 

 I stopped for a beer at the local watering hole, with the ubiquitous name of Ted's. Not a heavy drinker, I frequented the place rarely, mostly to watch sporting events when I couldn't get them on TV. MMA fights, Boxing matches, Blacked out football games, March madness. 

 I'm not a complete sports fanatic, but I do enjoy them on occasion. 

 I sipped my beer, pondering the great question. What to do about Tom? 

 It was more difficult than it should have been. The essence of the issue was I had no desire to hurt Marie in any way. She was a great friend, and a nice person, who had done nothing wrong.  

 

 

===

Expose him, and cause a divorce. Would that help her or hurt her? Affect him financially, and in the end, she would end up paying, at least partially. Humiliate him publicly, and she suffered with him. 

 Fuck. This really sucked. Why couldn't my wife cheat with some stranger, where I didn't really care what kind of collateral damage there was? 

 The more I thought about it, the more it came back to one thing. Direct physical retribution. Something that as a male I was programmed to desire, and which for the most part would only affect the intended. Politically incorrect, I know, but damn, there was something fulfilling about the idea. 

 I was not a naturally violent person, but I didn't shun it. I'd been in enough fights growing up, all the way through college, that I knew I could hold my own, but against the wrong opponent, I'd be mince-meat. 

 Fortunately, Tom was not the 'wrong' opponent. Physically unimpressive, and visually out of shape, once again I wondered 'Why him?' 

 I recalled Paul's offer of an alibi, or even direct assistance. I wasn't an ex- seal, green-beret, kung-fu expert. I didn't have an underworld connection to the mafia, or some beefy best friend who liked to hurt people for a living... 

 Or did I? 

 No, scratch that. Nobody I could trust, and besides, there was a certain visceral satisfaction that came from dealing out the pain directly, in person. My original intention of taser, abduction, and a good working over was kind of stolen by my wife. Now I was leaning toward a dark alley, and the extended application of some type of blunt weapon to various parts of Tom's anatomy. Between the legs would be especially appropriate, but that might give away too much. Who but me would want to hurt him there? 

 Wait! That was a great question. Was there anybody else who might have some reason to wish him ill? If he was the kind of guy to go after my wife, without remorse, and bring in others to get involved, perhaps there was more to it. There were a few issues that kept niggling at my hind-brain, begging to be noticed. Questions that needed an answer. Details that didn't make sense... 

 Ah. Perhaps I had the beginning of a plan after all. 

 * * * 

 Things were mostly calm when I got home, and the ladies got together to clear the way for the tree, and help with securing the trunk in the stand. I had sap on my hands and arms, and a watering eye where one branch had poked me, but I also had a damn good looking tree standing in our living room. 

 I went to clean up, and returned to four lovely ladies decorating the secular Christmas icon. Holiday music was playing on the stereo, and you would have thought there wasn't a single thing wrong in the world. 

 I was working on the lights, when Carol spoke up. "We're not going to tell him." 

 I nodded, testing the little bulbs to find out why half the string wouldn't light. 

 Wendy was standing near me. "Aren't you going to say something? Get mad maybe?" 

 "Say what?" 

 "What you think," she answered. 

 "Alright. Do I think she should tell him? Yes. But I'm not sure. I don't know their relationship, what that would cost. I'd rather know, and work through it, but that's me. What she did was bad, but not unforgivable. Seriously though, I think you all know better. My only question is what if he finds out? That would make it worse, I think." 

 "Why would he find out?" Kelly asked. 

 "Oh, I don't know. Maybe because Miguel might blackmail her. Then Alice has the choice of exposure, or keep doing it. I God-damned expect she won't keep doing it, because then I would tell Dan." 

 Alice spoke up. "Do you really think he might do that?" 

 "What man would want to give up easy no-strings-attached blowjobs, especially if he's getting paid for them?" I turned to her. "When was the last one?" 

 "More than two weeks ago," she confessed. 

 "And he hasn't looked for more?" 

 "I...He's only been back once, and I made myself scarce. When I was there, I made sure I had several people with me." 

 "If you're not going to tell Dan, you'll have to figure out something to do about Miguel. That's all I'm saying. Who else knows?" 

 "Just the people in this room." 

 "And we're not telling," I said, nodding. "Hopefully if word leaks out about Wendy's indiscretions, it won't end up getting tracked back to you." 

 Wendy scolded me. "I already took care of that." 

 "So far. Doesn't mean it will stick. Three men, who've already told numerous others, even if they say they took it back. The rumor is out there. The subject's been broached. Paul said he never believed it, but not everyone's Paul. He was standing with two other men when he was told. You can expect there will be quite a few men who might want to see if the rumors are true. Who knows if any women heard anything? We know Marie's wondering. If it gets in the wives' gossip line, it will spread like wildfire." 

 Wendy looked obviously upset. "You really think guys are going to start hitting on me? That the wives might start talking?" 

 "The guys? Pretty much guaranteed. Why not? If you'd do Tom or Jarrod, shit, you'd do anybody. That's the way they're going to see it." 

 Carol spoke up. "You don't have to mean about it, John." 

 I grinned as the string of lights lit up. "I'm not Mom, I swear. Hell, I wish it weren't true. I have no doubt at all dozens of men heard the tale. Tom and the others might deny it to the ones they told directly, but how about the next ones down the line? Reputation, once it's questioned, is almost impossible to clear up." 

 Wendy walked away from the tree and sat down. "Crap. This just keeps getting worse and worse, doesn't it? You warned me, that first night. I know." 

 I went over and sat down next to her. "It's not getting worse. The worst part was us, and that's taken care of. Now we figure out a way to survive the fallout." 

 "How?" Wendy asked. 

 "Stand tall. Don't act any different around our friends, except turn down the flirting a notch. Any guy makes the least bit of comment that's inappropriate you shut them down hard. They do it twice, you come to me. You stay away from the three bastards who caused this. The first time they speak to you, tell them you never want to speak with them again, and if they persist, you come to me. Never be alone with any man, for any reason, unless you're absolutely sure that you can trust him, and probably not even then. We let time work on our side, and after a year or so, they should stop trying, and things may get back to normal. Never with those three, we're done with them. You're probably going to have to give up your friendship with Marie." 

 "Give up Marie? She's my best friend!" 

 "That's the cost. Sad isn't it? Maybe you can salvage it, but you'll have to make her understand that Tom has to be out of the picture. Completely." 

 "But we took care of him," she whined. 

 "No. You neutralized him, maybe. I'll never be able to be civil to him again. If he says two words to me, chances are I'll punch him in the face. Kick him in the nuts once he's down. Repeatedly." 

 She got up and walked to the back of the house. Maybe she was finally realizing the depths of what her actions had cost us. 

 The little get-together broke up before much longer, with Alice and Carol both leaving shortly after. I gave Alice a hug, and told her I'd think about the Miguel issue. She thanked me and apologized again. 

 Carol gave me a bigger hug. "I guess I have to thank you again. You've brought me and my girls closer than ever. Not under the best of circumstances, but it is what it is. Thanks." 

 "They're good girls. You did a great job. One stupid mistake, that escalated. I think we caught it early enough to avoid the worst." 

 She pulled me down for a kiss, and it was far from anything a mother-in-law should do. She grinned afterward. "You're determined to get my bottom lit up, aren't you?" 

 "Hey! Don't blame that one on me!" 

 She gave me another peck. "It's your fault. You had to be so damn sweet and lovable. Wendy's a luck girl." 

 "Ed's a lucky man," I reminded her. 

 "He's gonna be lucky tonight. Another kiss like that and I'll have to change my panties." 

 "Mom!" 

 She chuckled. "Don't make it worse, John. Comfort your wife tonight, alright? She's going to be hurting." 

 "I know. She gets the middle of the bed." 

 Carol pouted. "There you go again. Tease. Putting that image in my head. God, I'm going to wear out that husband of mine." 

 I laughed, giving her a hug. "We're going to sleep in tomorrow. Until at least 11:00. I think we need a little playtime. Don't you dare come over before 10: 00." 

 She looked surprised, then gave me a kick in the shins. "You are a bastard. Teasing an old woman like that." 

 "Not before 10:00, you hear me?" 

 She smiled. "I'm leaving. Before I leave a puddle on your front stoop. Goodnight John." 

 "'Night Mom. You are the best you know." 

 "Keep it up, and you're going to find out," she told me over her shoulder. "I won't be able to sit for a week." 

 * * * 

 Kelly helped me clean up a bit, and I realized I'd never eaten. I ordered a pizza delivered, and when it arrived, we took it back to the bedroom. 

 It took a bit to cajole Wendy out from under the covers, but Kelly and I worked on her, cuddling her, kissing her. We fed her, and each other, until it turned playful, and a little naughty. Wendy was finally laughing, "You guys are making a mess," she griped playfully. 

 "Yep. I'm thinking group shower when this is done," I told her. 

 Kelly offered to clean up, and I took my wife into the shower. It was wonderful, loving and playful, without getting too carried away. She was shampooing my hair, when I heard the shower door open. 

 "We need a bigger shower," I heard Kelly announce, before feeling her flesh against mine. Her hands joined Wendy's in my hair. 

 "I never planned on trying to fit three in here," I explained. 

 One of the hands had moved down below the waist, and was lathering up my cock and the hair above it. "We should clean him up down here," Kelly said. "I'm tired of getting hairs stuck in my teeth." 

 "Shave him clean?" Wendy asked. 

 "Naw, I thing that looks weird. Just clean it up, you know? Trimmed and neat." 

 "Don't I get a say in it?" I asked. 

 They were rinsing off my hair, and I felt lips brush against mine. "Of course you do dear," my wife said softly. "Do you want blowjobs or not?" 

 "It that how it is, then?" 

 She laughed, "Of course not. But if you did let us clean you up, we'd enjoy it more. Don't you want us to be happy, John?" 

 That was how I ended up sitting on the edge of the sink, with two women wielding scissors and razors shearing me. Nothing I'd ever thought I'd be into, but I was willing to go along if that's what it took to make them happy. There was plenty of 'sampling' of the results to go along. They were of the impression that the job was easier done, if I was hard while they were doing it. 

 Of course, once I was finished, the conversation reverted to the girls' own personal care down there, and it was a good twenty minutes longer before we escaped from the bathroom. 

 I admitted I preferred a little hair, not the completely bald look. For Wendy, the girls decided on a two-inch high triangle, pointing the way. Kelly was more of a minimalist, and didn't have a lot of pubic hair to start with. A little landing strip was all she was left with by the time we were done. 

 After that experience, it seemed natural for us to test the results, and I was encouraged to go down on both of them, and they took turns with me, before working together. Wendy's earlier suggestion of taking all three of her holes fell by the roadside. It was an oral only evening of debauchery, and after they each got me off once, they were definitely in an ornery mood, and were determined to make me wait for the last release. Wait, and wait, and wait. 

 It was an incredible night, and any concerns that Kelly had about my going down on her earlier were soon put to rest. 

 "I did say oral only," Wendy teased her, while I was parked between the teen's slender legs. "I'd still prefer if you guys didn't do it behind my back. When I'm here, I don't mind. Not in the least. But when I'm not, and I think of you two together, I get a little jealous." 

 I moved away from Kelly, going after my wife, and dragging her into my arms. "She's adorable, but you're right. It's not the same if you're not here." 

 Kelly snuggled into us. "I'm cool with whatever you want. I love the feeling of being in your arms. Either of you. That's more than enough for me. Let's tone it down. I'll only be with either of you intimately, when all three of us are together. Is that Ok?" 

 Wendy was a little quiet. "I don't want to interfere," she said softly. 

 I gave her a little shake. "Don't be silly. Kelly and I are more about the closeness than the sex. Let's not do anything that gives you the least concern. That would be stupid. You call the shots, baby." 

 Kelly looked nervous. "I don't have to be here at all, if it bothers you Wendy. No more teasing or anything. I swear." 

 Wendy put her arm around our playmate, pulling her close. "I like it when you're here with us sometimes. Most of the time, to be honest. Sometimes I need him for myself, but when we're playing around, just having fun, it's great to have you with us. I never had contemplated anything like it, but you're so good about it. It makes everything better." 

 My wife looked at me, giving me a soft kiss. "You agree? It's better with her here?" 

 I kissed her back. "Not 100%. It can be sensational, and watching you two taking care of me together is nothing short of mind-blowing. But it's not better than the times when I want you, and only you, for loving, not for sex. I'm not sure I'm saying it right, but do you know what I mean? There's times when it's so much more than sex." 

 Wendy gave me a smile. "I know exactly what you mean, and you lost that for several months, didn't you? I bet that's why all you wanted was my pussy for those last couple of months. I was such an idiot not to understand that. I... I felt kind of slighted, that you were tired of my blowjobs, when you'd stop them every time. I'm sorry." 

 "No, it's my fault too. I know what you like, and I took it away from you. No more of that. For the record, I love your blowjobs. Always have, and still do," I said. 

 Wendy giggled, cuddling into me. "We were both kind of stupid. No more either/ or. We can do both. Especially now that I got that stupid idea of no oral after sex out of the way. One more thing we owe our lover-girl for." She grinned mischievously. "Want to pay her back a little?" 

 I spent the next half-hour between Kelly's legs, pleasuring her, while my wife teased her with hugs and kisses, titty play, and eventually, to my surprise, straddling the girl's face. We had worn her out by the time we were done. 

 "That was excessively naughty," I teased my wife, as we cuddled the exhausted teen between us. 

 Kelly smiled tiredly. "Naughty Wendy." 

 Wendy blushed. "Not too far, was it Kelly? I got carried away." 

 Kelly shook her head. "Never too far with you. I love you. I would do anything for you." 

 They kissed, separating a bit, looking into each other's eyes, then their lips met again. And stayed together, quietly, lovingly, joined at the mouth. I was content to hold Kelly in my arms, while my wife made out with the young girl like they were teenagers. Hell, one of them was. I was regretting that the last blowjob had worn me out. I could feel a little stirring down below, but not enough. 

 They separated, and Kelly turned to me. She ran her fingers through my hair, then brushed her lips across mine. "You don't mind that I love her as much as you?" 

 "No. I think it's wonderful," I said softly. We cuddled and kissed, our mouths joined for a quiet eternity. 

 I eventually rolled her onto her back, between Wendy and me. I looked at my wife watching us contently. "Whatever you two want to do together, I'll be happy with," I told her. 

 Wendy blushed, her eyes glancing down at Kelly. "We'll see," she said softly, a hint of nervousness displayed in her voice. 

 I leaned across our girl, and kissed my wife tenderly. "I adore you, you know?" 

 She smiled. "I know. It's the only thing that makes this possible. Thank you for the way you handled Alice tonight. Your forgiving her made the rest possible. I don't think I would have been able to, if not for you. I know Mom wouldn't. Thanks for putting the family first." 

 "I didn't. I put you first. I always will. I believe you'll be happier with her in your life than out of it. If I didn't, I would have destroyed her. I'm still pissed at her. But even more than getting back at her, I want you happy, and in this case, that means putting the things she did aside, and forgiving her. I won't forget though." 

 Wendy seemed a little surprised. "Oh. I guess I didn't understand. You would have destroyed her?" 

 "If she was anyone but your sister. She came too damn close to breaking up this marriage. Anyone who comes between you and me, had best watch their back," I said, a little of my anger returning. 

 "I never would. I promise," Kelly said fearfully. 

 I'd thought she was asleep, she'd been so quiet. She was watching me anxiously. I stroked her face softly, and kissed the tip of her nose. "I know, Angel. You're just the opposite. You bring us together, make us better. I love you for that." 

 That seemed to relax her, and she smiled, then turned to Wendy, cuddling in close, squirming down a little so her head was resting between my wife's milk enlarged breasts. I scooted closer, spooning her, making a tight little teen sandwich. She wriggled a little, pressing her butt back against me. I pressed against her, and heard her sigh contentedly. 

 Wendy was half-asleep, eyes closed, head bent forward, chin resting on the top of Kelly's head. I reached across and placed my hand on her waist, needing to feel her. I cuddled my Angel, and leaned my head over, until my forehead rested against Wendy's. It all felt so good, so natural. Strange, I'm sure, to anybody who wasn't there, but perfect in the moment. 

 "Love you," I heard the slightest whisper escape Wendy's lips. 

 "I know, baby," I answered softly, secure in knowing it was true. 

 * * * 

 I don't know how I slept the night before. 

 When I woke, I could barely move. Wendy was lying at an angle, head and shoulders resting on my chest, her arm thrown across me. Looking down past her, our resident nudist Kelly was on her belly, laying across my thighs. Her legs were tangled with Wendy's. 

 Our 18 year old mattress companion's head was resting on my thigh, one arm curled under my out-turned knee. When I tried to move, she whimpered a little, grabbing my leg and snuggling in closer. Her nearer arm was angled, her hand resting on my stomach, forearm pressed against Wendy's side. 

 I don't know how either of them could sleep like that, but I adjusted myself slightly, and leaned back, a smile on my face. There were worse ways to wake up. 

 I kissed the top of Wendy's head, content to caress her back and relax. With my other hand, I was able to reach down and brush Kelly's hair back, exposing her pretty face, so quiet and innocent in sleep. I closed my eyes, and reveled in my situation. Life was good. 

 Wendy must have been half-awake. She turned her head slightly and kissed my chest, then snuggled in. My hand caressing her back traveled further, gently rubbing her curvaceous bottom. I reminded myself to make sure I got some of that aloe on her butt. I was feeling a little guilty about how bruised she'd looked. Not that she hadn't earned it. 

 Kelly was moving around, and I felt her face nuzzle up against my crotch. It didn't take more than a few seconds for me to respond. I looked down, and saw her wiggle her head in tighter, until my shaft was pressed against her lower face. A small kiss pressed against my flesh, then her lips parted, moving around my shaft, the tip of her tongue teasing me. Looking at her, I could swear she was still asleep.  

 

 

===

I was happy to let her do her thing, utterly relaxed, except for those few inches the teen was caressing. Wendy shifted, lifting her body a bit, before turning her face toward me. I opened my eyes to see her gazing at me, a small smile turning up the corner of her lips. "Morning," she whispered softly. 

 I returned her smile. "Love you, baby." 

 She wiggled closer, so her face was closer to mine, and raised her lips for a kiss, which I happily gave her. 

 "I know why you're smiling," she teased sleepily. "Our girl's being naughty." 

 "Shh," I said softly. "I think she's still asleep." 

 Wendy grinned. "Really?" she whispered. 

 I nodded. "She hasn't moved in several minutes. Except for that naughty mouth of hers. Maybe she's dreaming." 

 "What do you want to do today?" she asked softly, bestowing little kisses on my chin that had me hardening further. 

 "Spend the morning with you in my bed. No other plans, although I think we need to find a car for Kelly soon. It might be a good day to look around for a decent used one." 

 Our whispers seemed so intimate, our faces so close to each other. "You really like her don't you?" Wendy said. 

 "I do. She's so sweet, so giving. I can't help but wonder how she ever ended up on the street. My heart bleeds for her. I want to take care of her, stop the destructive way she was living her life. I'm not in love with her, if that's what you're thinking." 

 She shook her head. "No. I can tell the difference. You're going to be a great father." 

 That seemed like an odd thing to say. I brushed it off. "I know you like her too." 

 Wendy nodded gently. "I think it's different than you. I keep thinking how she brought us back together, when she could have driven a wedge between us. From the first time she shared your cum with me, slapping me for being so ignorant, to that whole day together, opening her heart, telling me so much about her hurt, making me see what I had done. What might have happened to me, to us. We have to help her. I have to. I hope you'll let me. Help me." 

 I kissed her softly. "Of course. I feel it too." 

 Wendy closed her eyes, cuddling in close. "Thank you," she mumbled. 

 I was still half asleep several minutes later, when I felt a change in the movement down below. Kelly was getting a little more active, and I felt her mouth move downward licking my balls, and capturing one in her mouth. I had to stifle a moan when she sucked on it, then did the same for the other. Her body shifted and I felt her hand on my shaft, holding it, stroking it softly. 

 I anticipated more, but she got up and crawled up the bed, opposite Wendy, and put her head on my shoulder. She didn't say anything, but she pulled the sheet which was barely hanging on the bed over us, then cuddled in. I put my arm around her, holding her. 

 Wendy was laying almost perpendicular to me, still facing me. Kelly leaned her head forward and kissed my wife on the forehead, then on the nose, and finally on the lips. I couldn't help but moan slightly when she stayed there, lips pressed against Wendy's. I couldn't see the kiss, but I felt the response in Wendy's body, as she slowly woke. 

 "Can I take care of him?" Kelly asked sleepily. 

 "That would be nice," Wendy murmured in response. 

 "You too?" Kelly whispered a few seconds later. 

 Wendy was slower to respond. "I... I'd like that." 

 Kelly rose up, and gave me a quick kiss. "You guys relax. I'm just going to fool around, Ok?" 

 I nodded. 

 She crawled under the sheets, and I felt her mouth move onto my cock. I'd been softening, but she fixed that quickly enough. She was gentle and loving, as she sucked me. 

 "Nice?" Wendy asked, eyes still closed. 

 "Very." 

 "You don't mind if she..." she hesitated to finish. 

 "Not at all. Just the opposite," I assured her. 

 Wendy opened her eyes, smiling. "I'm getting wet thinking about it." 

 "Good," I said, then closed my eyes, concentrating on what Kelly was doing to me. 

 The teen didn't seem to be in a hurry, but she wasn't dragging it out either. As I got more excited, she did nothing to slow me down, letting me get worked up until I was thrusting into her mouth, and coming for her. She took her time finishing, until I was soft. I felt her climb across my legs, then Wendy was shifting her body, getting comfortable. I heard her first sigh, and knew that Kelly had started on her. 

 "God, this is exciting, knowing what she's doing to you," I whispered, running my fingers through Wendy's hair. 

 "Really?" Wendy whispered. 

 "Hell yeah. It's amazing." 

 Wendy smiled and nodded. "It is." 

 I held my wife as she achieved her first orgasm of the morning several minutes later. Kelly didn't stop, and it was thrilling to see Wendy gasping, writhing in my arms as she reached several more. 

 She was coming off a big one, clinging to me. "I need you now, John. Please," she whimpered. 

 I was definitely ready, and I pulled myself out from under Kelly's legs, and dragged the sheet away. I playfully lifted Kelly up from between my wife's legs, and took her place, easing my cock home, then sitting upright and fucking my sexy woman. 

 Kelly scurried up the bed, and started kissing Wendy, while I drove my cock in and out of her. I felt good, hard but in control, and suspected I'd be able to take my time enjoying myself. 

 That changed, and my heart skipped a beat when Kelly got up and straddled Wendy's face. I hadn't seen that one coming. A few seconds later I heard Wendy whimpering, as she stiffened and I felt her come on my cock. I tilted her legs back, leaning over her and fucking her harder. I leaned my head against Kelly's back, kissing her smooth young skin, as I pounded away at my wife. 

 I don't remember a time when she was so excited. She had another huge orgasm, her cries muffled between Kelly's thighs. Kelly was whimpering, hanging onto the headboard, grinding her pussy down against Wendy's face. I pulled Wendy's legs together, her ankles over my shoulders, and fucked her hard. 

 The whole bed was shaking a little later, as the two girls came almost in unison. I felt myself getting close, but was nowhere near willing to end our play. I stopped, my cock buried in my wife, and pulled Kelly backward against me. She looked up into my eyes, smiling. "Take care of her for a while, I need a break," I told her. 

 Her grin broadened as she climbed off my wife. I gave Wendy a few more deep thrusts, and had barely pulled off when Kelly dove in and took my place. I climbed up the bed, looked down at my wife's soaked face. The lust in her eyes was exciting. I kissed her, tasting Kelly's juices. "We're going to wear you out, wild thing." 

 "I...I'm sorry," she gasped nervously. 

 I laughed. "I hope not. That was incredible. Did you like it?" 

 She was whimpering under Kelly's attention, and her eyes rolled back for a moment. "God, yes! Your toy. Both of yours..." 

 The short break was enough to stem any need to come, and I brought my cock to her lips. She was too distracted to give me her best, but she sucked my cock like she was desperate for it. I let Kelly give her a couple of more orgasms before I felt the need to take her again. 

 I pulled away, and almost laughed as Wendy's lips tried to cling to me. I moved down the bed, and with a small push, urged Kelly away. When she moved, I grabbed my wife's hips, and lifted her up, flipping her over roughly. I pulled her ass up, opening her legs, and moved between them. It only took a few seconds to be back inside Wendy, stroking away. 

 "Kiss me, Kelly," I told the adorable teen watching me. 

 She smiled, and wrapped her arms around my neck, before nearly sucking my tongue off. When she finally gave me a moment to breath, I told her to move up the bed, and let Wendy pleasure her. 

 She didn't need any more encouraging, and was sitting with her legs splayed, Wendy's face lodged in her pussy, while I long-stroked my wife. 

 I tried to pace myself. I was having the time of my life, watching us turn my wife inside out. Kelly had a pretty, shuddering orgasm, and Wendy had a few small ones of her own. I had my thumb in her back door, teasing her. The excitement was too much, and I wasn't about to pull out this time. I needed to fill her. 

 I grabbed her hips and pounded her as hard as I could. Wendy pulled her face out of Kelly's crotch, and cried out, trembling. Kelly grabbed her by the hair, and pulled her mouth back down where she thought it belonged while I approached my finish. Several deep hard thrusts later I was too far gone to stop, and I growled "Fuck!" loudly as I erupted inside her. It was incredible, each release seeming to start in my lower back, sending tingles down my spine, as I pumped her full. 

 I was so distracted by my finish that I was surprised when Kelly's face appeared underneath me. I pulled out of Wendy, and Kelly took my place, pulling Wendy down, and sucking my juices out of her. 

 Gasping, my heart hammering in my chest, I climbed up the bed, and took over Kelly's place, pulling Wendy's face into my lap. She took me in her mouth, shuddering, and sucked on my semi-hard cock. 

 Kelly's body was sticking out from under Wendy at an angle. I reached down between the teenager's legs, and played with her wet pussy, while my wife sucked away. Kelly was wriggling cutely, thrusting back against my hand. I was only slightly surprised, when a few minutes later, in between a couple of Wendy's almost endless orgasms, that I was getting hard again. 

 That was how Carol found us. 

 She walked in the bedroom door, shaking her head. "I waited until 10:30. You three are incorrigible." 

 Wendy only whimpered and kept sucking. 

 "Morning, Mom. We're trying to see if we can wear her out," I said grinning. 

 She nodded tolerantly. "Jeannie's still sleeping. I can see her Mommy is no position to be doing any feeding at the moment. I'll see if I can lay her down." 

 She disappeared out the door, and I found that the added attention had finished the job that Wendy's mouth had been doing. I was hard and ready for another go. 

 I pulled out of her mouth, and laid down beside her. "Ride me, Wendy," I told her. 

 She looked at me nervously. "Mom's here." 

 "Ride me, or we'll both ride you," I told her. 

 She blushed, then climbed off Kelly's glistening face, and straddled my waist. She lowered herself on my cock, and it set off yet another orgasm. "G-g-g-god," she gasped, "I...I can't stop coming." 

 I grinned, and waved Kelly closer. "You too, Angel. Ride me." 

 The teen smiled, and gave me a kiss. "I'd love to." 

 She straddled my head, lowering that pretty little gash down to my mouth, facing Wendy. I lost track of things then, but heard the girls talking to Carol, shortly after. 

 It probably wasn't my best plan ever. I wasn't going to be coming any time soon, and the girls seemed happy enough to use me for a good long while. Wendy's actions slowed, a nice easy screwing, while Kelly was more than happy to let me lick her endlessly, coming softly every so often. 

 In the meantime, I listened to the girls chat, as if nothing unusual was happening. I felt the pressure on the bed, as Carol sat down beside us. Kelly was laughing, saying we all were each other's breakfast. Wendy was pouting that we wouldn't leave her alone, she was so sensitive that if she moved wrong, she'd come again. She gasped, when I thrust up against her hard, lifting her off the bed, after I heard that. It got a giggle out of the other two. 

 "Mom!" Wendy cried out, and I almost laughed when I heard Carol teasing her. "Just one picture. Your father's never going to believe this. I'm going to get sooo lucky." 

 They talked about Alice, and Kelly scolded Wendy for never calling Marie. They discussed some more last minute shopping and possibly going out looking for a car. Kelly stopped squirming on my tongue for a second. "I can't let you do that," she argued. 

 Wendy laughed. "You're ours now, and if we want to get you a car, there isn't a damn thing you can do about it." 

 "It's too much already," Kelly argued. 

 Carol interjected, "We should talk to the Evans. They still have their old Honda sitting in the driveway. I don't think it's moved in almost a year. I bet they'd let it go cheap." 

 "Have Dad talk to them," Wendy said. 

 I was surprised at how easily they could carry on a conversation. It almost made me wonder if I wasn't doing my job well. Thankfully Kelly shifted position, grinding down against my face, before coming nicely. Ego soothing. She wasn't totally immune to me. 

 They were talking about going out for lunch, when I heard the baby monitor go off, and our daughter's crying. 

 "Crap," Wendy whined. "Let me have one more, and then you can finish him, Ok Kel?" 

 "Sounds like a deal to me," Kelly giggled. I felt Wendy's actions change, and she was pounding down on my cock eagerly, forcefully. I felt her weight shift again, and the movement was even faster. 

 "Doesn't he ever come?" Carol asked. 

 Kelly laughed. "It's his third one this morning. He'll be a while." 

 I didn't want to disabuse her of the notion, but the way things were going with Wendy, it wouldn't be that much longer. I thrust back against her, and was gratified to hear her sexy moans, before she cried out and slammed down on my cock, grinding against me hard. 

 A few seconds later, I felt the coolness of the air as she climbed free. That didn't last long before Kelly leaned down and her mouth engulfed me. The change in position gave me a little light, and I could breathe a bit easier. I wasn't doing as good a job on Kelly's young pussy as I could have, but I had good cause for being distracted. 

 I felt the weight on the other side of the bed, as Jeannie's greedy cries stopped. "Aren't they cute together?" Wendy said. 

 Carol laughed. "I don't know if I'd call it cute, but they're a handsome pair. It doesn't bother you at all?" 

 "Nope. I know they both love me a hell of a lot more than they love each other. Pretty cool, huh?" Wendy answered. 

 I knew it was true of me, but Kelly? 

 Abruptly, Kelly seemed determined to finish me. Once she'd made up her mind, I was toast. I didn't last another minute, groaning between her legs, before I was filling her mouth. 

 She climbed off me shortly after, and I was done. Finished. As worn out as I was hoping to leave Wendy. I tried to catch my breath, wiping my wet face, laying there, exhausted. I could have used another full night's sleep. 

 I raised my head and looked over at my wife feeding our daughter. She gazed on me lovingly, smiling. Kelly was behind her, hugging her. She looked up at me as well, caught my eye, and opened her mouth, showing me her hard won reward. She grinned happily, and closed it, before leaning her head on Wendy's shoulder. 

 I turned to look at Carol, who was sitting nearby, once again clad only in her panties. She grinned at me, then laid down beside me, cuddling in. 

 "You poor man. I don't see how you're going to survive those two." 

 I gave her a squeeze, then let my hand slide down her body, giving her butt a squeeze. She looked up at me, a surprised look on her face. "It's a tough job, but I sure as hell ain't going to let anyone else do it," I told her. 

 She giggled, and gave me a kiss, then made a face. "You're going to have to do something about that breath, young man." 

 "As soon as I have enough strength to climb out of this bed. I'm thinking Wednesday." 

 She wriggled against me, her hand stroking my side. "No way. You're going to clean up and take all four of your girls to lunch." 

 I was naughty, and slid my hand in the back of her panties, squeezing her cheek. "John!" she scolded, but I noticed she didn't brush my hand away. Reason enough to give her other cheek a nice squeeze and a rub. 

 "Four? Are you one of my girls, Mom?" 

 She smiled and kissed my cheek. "Ever since you called me over that first night. I'm not a plaything like those two, but yes, John. I'm yours too. Just like you're one of my boys." 

 I left her bottom alone, and surprised her by pulling her on top of me. "You don't know how happy that makes me." 

 She laughed. "Better not be too happy. I'm not ready for the kind of whipping I'd get if you got any more friendly." 

 I gave her a little shake and a hug. "Don't worry. Not that you aren't sizzling hot, but I'm the last person in the world you'd have to worry about taking things too far." 

 She smiled. "Good. As long as we understand our limits." She laid back down on me, her legs opening and embracing my legs, her mouth planting little kisses on my chest." 

 I looked over at my wife, a little surprised at her mother's intimate actions. 

 "It's your own fault," she said grinning. "So damn irresistible." 

 I let my hands wander back down Carol's back, until I had my hands in her panties again, massaging her butt cheeks. She clearly had no problem with that, grinding her hips against me, and nibbling on my neck, and then my ear. 

 "You are such a naughty boy," she said softly. "I am your wife's mother, remember?" she teased. 

 "My wife's hot mother, almost naked in my bed," I teased back. 

 "God, what am I going to do with you?" Wendy laughed, reaching out and slapping my hand. "Down boy." 

 I looked over at her, grinning guiltily. Kelly was gone, and I heard the water running in the tub. 

 "John!" Carol snapped, sliding off my body. "What's this about?" she said, holding my stiff cock in her hand, waving it. 

 "Mother! Leave that alone!" 

 Carol's hand pulled away quickly. "I thought you were done for the day!" she snapped, slapping my chest. 

 "Hey! So did I! It's not my fault you were driving me crazy." I gave her a squeeze. "If you'll take care of burping your granddaughter, I'll let my sexy wife take care of this." 

 "I'll do nothing of the kind!" Wendy said, but her grin let me know she was teasing. "I didn't cause it, so I have no responsibility here." 

 I sat up and took Jeannie from her breast. "She is finished, isn't she?" 

 "Yes, but that doesn't mean..." 

 I passed my daughter across the bed, and pulled Wendy close. "You promised you'd never deny me," I reminded her. 

 "God, John! You are so bad. You want to take me now? With my mother and our baby here? Didn't you get enough?" 

 I pulled her underneath me, and her legs opened, allowing me access. I stroked my cock, rubbing it against her opening. 

 "Gentle, you beast. You've worn me out," she whispered, but I saw the look in her eye. 

 I eased myself inside of her, taking my time, until I was buried. I leaned over her, kissing her neck. "I'll never get enough of you. Haven't you figured that out yet?" 

 "I can't believe you," she said softly, thrusting back against me. "That denying thing. We keep it in the house, Ok? I don't need you getting all worked up and doing me in the ladies room in some bar." 

 I kissed her, and realized if my breath was as bad as hers, her mother was right. "I'd never embarrass you. I would wait until I got you to the backseat of our car." 

 "Beast," she moaned, her hands grabbing my ass as I thrust into her. "In front of my mother." 

 "I love you," I whispered to her. "More than life itself." 

 "Love me, John. Love me forever," she gasped, her arms wrapping around my body, clutching me to her. 

 It wasn't forever, but it was a good long while. We were alone when we finished. She was clinging to me, needy. "You do love me, don't you?" she asked. 

 "Always and forever. Nothing will ever change that." 

 "You know I'm sorry, right? I never meant to hurt you," she whispered. 

 "I know. You don't have to say it. It's over, and you have nothing more to be sorry about, Ok? Don't even think about it. It happened, and if anything, we're better for it. I know you'll never cheat on me. As much as I know anything in my life." 

 She nodded. "Good. I'd die without you." She kissed me, and made a face. "Jesus, we need to clean up, don't we?"  

 

 

===

I nodded, and got up out of her arms. I helped her from the bed, and took her to the shower with me, wondering how life could get any better. 

 I was done first, and went out to join the rest of the family in the living room. 

 "About time," Carol said, looking at her watch. 

 "Don't start, Mom. It was your fault," I told her. 

 "Me!" 

 "Yes, you. Getting me worked up like that. Naughty girl." I leaned over and gave her a quick kiss. "You didn't stick around?" 

 She shook her head. "No way. You guys weren't playing anymore. That was way too intimate for me to intrude. You really are crazy about her, aren't you?" 

 I plopped down next to her, watching Kelly play with my daughter. "And then some. She's the best. You did good raising her." 

 Carol leaned over and gave me a hug. "I'm glad. I... I get a little nervous," she said, glancing meaningfully at our resident ex-street walker. 

 Kelly was paying attention. She laughed, "Don't worry about me. Even when they were at each other's throats that first night, it was obvious. Nothing's going to get between them. Not even someone as gorgeous and irresistible as me," she teased playfully. 

 She looked up at Carol. "As long as you keep things PG rated. You're just like her, with another 20 years experience. That's gotta be hard to resist. You're not going to steal your baby's man, are you?" 

 Carol looked at her in surprise, her mouth hanging open. "Me? Like that could ever happen. No way. Besides, if you can't do it, I don't see anybody being able to." 

 Kelly scooped up Jeannie in her arms, then sat in my lap. "Good. As long as we behave, they're as good as gold." She turned her head to me, and gave me a little kiss. "Right handsome?" 

 "Absolutely. I love you both, but Wendy's my life." 

 "Perfect. Just don't forget it, and we'll all be happy as clams," Carol answered, leaning against me. 

 Wendy walked in, looking beautiful as always. "Alright, what are you guys scheming now?" 

 Carol smiled at her. "How to make sure that nobody ever gets between you two again." 

 Wendy took her daughter from Kelly. "I don't think you have to worry about that, does she, hubby dearest?" 

 "I believe that's the answer we all arrived at," I said, lifting a pouting Kelly out of my lap. "I, for one, am starving. Let's get this show on the road, or we'll be eating dinner instead of lunch." 

 * * * 

 Patty's Place was an odd little eating establishment. It was only open for breakfast during the week, and through lunch on the weekends. Mom nearly had a fit when I announced that was where we were going. Their portions were huge, and not a single healthy item on their entire menu. 

 I was feeling pretty amazing, seated with the three beautiful women, and my magical daughter sleeping in her car carrier at the end of the table. Once more I felt a pang of envy at how he could sleep so much, anywhere. 

 Wendy was sitting beside me, at the end next to our girl. Kelly was across from me, with Mom next to her. Everyone was in a great mood. Two days before Christmas, with the holiday merriment making everything a little better. 

 Mom had just gotten off the phone with her husband. "Y'all can stop by the Evans place any time. They'd be happy to unload the car." She gave us their number, so we could call ahead. 

 The meal was a feast, every plate enough for two. Kelly and I both managed to clean ours. I sometimes wondered if the girl had a tapeworm. How could she eat as much as she did, and still look like a starving waif? 

 "What?" she asked, plucking a sausage off of Mom's plate. 

 "Still hungry?" I teased. 

 She blushed. "Making up for a few lost meals. So sue me. When I get over 105 I'll slow down." 

 "Don't worry, Angel. I'll widen the door to the bedroom if I have to." 

 I dodged the incoming chunk of sausage laughing. "Now I've seen everything. Kelly throwing away food." 

 "Keep it up, buster, and I'll make you beg so hard, you'll be crying." She gave me a smirk, poking her fork into Wendy's side of pancakes which hadn't seen any action in a while. 

 "Hey strangers!" I heard, and saw Tonja walking our way. My fists clenched at my side, because I knew her husband Aaron couldn't be too far away. The lousy bastard. 

 Sure enough, while Tonja got introduced to Kelly and Mom, Aaron walked up behind her, their two little ones in tow. They were going to be seated right next to us, and he was getting them situated. He glanced over at me a couple of times, and I could see the nervousness. 

 I was surprised when he walked over to my end of the table, after getting the kids settled. 

 "John, can I talk to you a minute? Outside?" 

 I wanted to punch him in the face, but I only nodded. "Be back in a minute," I told the girls. 

 We walked out the door, and he kept going a ways, down to the corner. I could see him screwing his courage up. He turned to face me, and I estimated my chances. I'm not a small guy, but Aaron looked like he could still be playing college ball. He had to be 6'3", two-twenty, and it was well distributed on him. He was as black as any man I'd ever seen, almost blue-black. I could well imagine the lure of a man like him for my wife. I braced myself. 

 "Listen. I owe you an apology. I really fucked up." 

 I didn't say anything. For one, I didn't know how much he thought I knew. 

 "I... I took advantage of Wendy," he said, his voice cracking. "It was wrong, and stupid. I was drunk, but there was no excuse for it." 

 "You slept with her?" I asked, testing him. 

 He shook his head no, adamantly. "God no! What I did was bad enough. I, shit, I let her give me a blowjob. Just the once, and it's been tearing me up ever since." 

 I just stared at him. 

 "You want to hit me, go for it. I deserve it. I was a bastard. I would never do that to a friend. I swear, the biggest mistake of my life. I... I couldn't take it. I told Tonja." 

 That shocked me. "Who else did you tell?" 

 "Nobody. I swear. No one. I was too ashamed. I'm not a cheater. It's just been Tonja since sophomore year. I never did anything like that before. I swear, I've never even been tempted. If it was anyone but Wendy... You know what she did afterward, don't you?" 

 I nodded. 

 "I had it coming. She let me off easy. So if you want some payback of your own, I understand. At the Christmas party Tom offered it to me again, but I couldn't. Not that she isn't tempting as hell..." 

 I raised my eyebrows, waiting for him to finish that train of thought. 

 "Damn it, John! We all know what she does for you. I couldn't help but think about that the first time, but never again. I'm sorry. I really am." 

 "How did Tonja take it?" I asked. 

 "You don't want to know. I'm so far in the doghouse, I'm wondering if I'll ever see the light of day. She says the only reason she's keeping me is because I came clean. If she'd heard it from anyone else, my ass would be out the door." 

 "Probably a smart move, then." 

 He nodded. "I hope it didn't cause too much trouble between you two. She wouldn't let us do anything else. Nothing. Said that would be cheating. I wanted you to know. It would kill me to think I was the cause of breaking you guys up. Damn, I fucked up." 

 I steadied my breath. I wanted to be angry with him. If he could just smirk once. Do something wrong. His groveling sucked most of the anger away. "Thanks for being up front about it." 

 He waited, nervously. "If you want to do something about it, can it not be here? Not in front of my kids. I... I can meet you somewhere." 

 I shook my head. "No. I think we're done. I'll let the women deal with you. It was a lousy thing to do, Aaron." 

 "Don't you think I know? I'd have to kill anyone did that to Tonja. It was great, you're one lucky mother-fucker to have that to come home to, but not worth any of it. I only hope that one day you can forgive me." 

 "Great? It was the worst blowjob she ever gave in her life. You have no idea." 

 His look was priceless. 

 "I'm not kidding. She's the best there is, when her heart is in it." I shook my head. "Let's not talk about this again. It's over, Ok? Give us some time. I really don't want to see you right now, but maybe with time I can deal with it." 

 He nodded rapidly. "Whatever you want. Thanks. I'm sorry. You're a better man than I am, John." 

 "Probably. I would never do that to a friend's wife. Not like that. No way." 

 He lowered his head, shaking it. "I know. God, I know." 

 I turned and went back to the table. I imagine he followed, but I didn't check. I took my seat, and Wendy looked at me nervously. "Everything Ok?" she asked. 

 I leaned close, dropping my voice. "An apology. He told Tonja." 

 Her eyes got big, and I heard her gasp. "Really?" 

 I nodded. "He's in deep shit. But at least they're still together." 

 She shook her head, eyes glistening. "God, what a mess. A few minutes of stupidity, and everyone pays and pays." 

 I moved closer, whispering. "He said it was great." 

 Her eyes flashed with anger. "I swear, John, I wasn't lying. The worst I ever gave. He didn't last two minutes. You have to believe me." 

 "It's kind of sad. That's great?" 

 She grinned sheepishly. "Jarrod was worse. And he was willing to pay for another one. Kind of ridiculous. I almost feel bad for the two of them." 

 She saw the look in my eye, and hurriedly added, "Almost. I said almost." 

 We were done eating, and they'd paid the bill while I was gone. We got up to leave, and as we said goodbye to Tonja and Aaron, she waved me over. 

 Fuck. 

 I walked her way and she grabbed my arm, pulling me down so she could whisper to me. "I'm so sorry, John. I'll take care of his sorry ass. Can you leave it to me? Please?" 

 Now I could see she was almost as nervous as he had been. "Sure. It's done as far as I'm concerned. I won't be sharing any beers with him anytime soon, but there won't be any payback. I appreciate that he was man enough to apologize." 

 She nodded gratefully. "Thanks. I... I won't be doing anything like that for you, if that's what you're thinking. No revenge." 

 "No. That's not what I was thinking. Not that I don't think you'd be amazing, but that's not my style. I'll let you and Wendy handle it." 

 She tugged me down and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "Thanks again. Don't be too harsh on Wendy. They used her. Bastards." 

 In the car, I had to spill both conversations. It took a few minutes, and I answered some questions. 

 Mom was the first to speak afterward. "So you're done with him? No revenge or nothing?" 

 I shrugged. "I guess. Not happy about it, but at least he apologized and showed remorse. I figure Tonja's going to make him pay for a while. Wendy already dealt with him on our end." 

 "What about the others?" she asked. 

 "I don't know yet. I haven't decided."
