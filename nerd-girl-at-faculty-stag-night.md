Nerd Girl at Faculty Stag Night
===============================
#1 

===

"I hate to break it to you gentlemen, but we are pathetic," sighed Roger Lamar, head of the Theater Department of the North Metropolitan Community College. "Look at us: six grown men on a Friday night, debating which Goddamned porno to watch. Back in the day, when fresh collegiate trim was a perquisite of our profession, guys like us would gather at the end of semester to share storis of all the coeds they'd bedded and cherries they'd popped. Nowadays, the best we can do is compare notes on which girls we'd like to bang, watch a few pornographic films and go home to jack off before bed. These are sad times, my friends. Sad times." 

"And when exactly was this golden age of profs banging coeds, Roger?" asked Joel Weiss. He was in the Mathematics Department and was hosting the evening's festivities. 

"Fuck if I know," admitted Roger as he took a long sip of his vodka tonic. "Certainly before my time." 

"Pre Enlightenment?" said Kurt Williams from Poli-Sci with a shit-giving smile. He scratched at his chin with his mangled left hand: a memento from Afghanistan. 

"With all the hair and that rangy beard, I'd say Neolithic," laughed Dr. James Basset - English Department - his smile flashing bright against his dark skin. 

Martin Demarest, the new English Composition instructor, said nothing. He knew Roger was notorious among the students for being a dirty old man so his lament about the lack of teenagers willing to throw their thighs open for the faculty was hardly surprising. Personally, he thought the guy was full of shit. 

Roger turned to Ernest Banyan - Economics - and cocked an eyebrow. "Aren't you going to take your dig at my age Ernie. I am over 40, after all." 

"Naw. I agree with you," said Ernie. "Remember Sara Henjum?" 

"Oh yeah, I forgot." Roger turned his large, shaggy head to Martin and explained. "Ernie here actually fucked a student a few years back." 

Ernie nodded. "Yeah... Well, she had dropped out earlier that semester... And I had to pay for it. But it still counts, I think." 

A few of the guys laughed at that. 

"Oh, and none of this leaves this room, got it?" said James to Martin. "First law of Stag Night." 

Martin nodded. 

"So," said Roger to Martin. "You're a young guy, in good shape, moderately attractive, I'd bet some of the girls have been giving you the eye... you get any action this semester?" 

"Um... actually..." 

The room exploded in noise. "What? You did?!" - "Son. Of. A. Fucking. Bitch." - "Dude!" 

"Cheers, rookie," said Rogers as he hoisted his glass. 

"No! No. I didn't have sex with her, but... well, it's a long story." 

"We are specifically here to share these types of long stories," said Joel. "Get the hell on with it." 

Martin looked around the room. Every eye was on him. 

"OK," he said. "She was a student in my Creative Writing section; not really what you'd call good looking although she seemed like the kind of person who really works at fading into the crowd: cheap glasses; straight, mousy brown hair; frumpy clothes; no makeup or even jewelry as far as I remember..." 

"Name?" 

"Jill Coode," he said, pronouncing it like the word 'could'. "Spelled C-O-O-D- E. " 

"Oh shit," said James. "I had her in my English lit class last Fall and I mispronounced it as 'coodie' on the first day. Everyone laughed. I still remember how mortified the poor girl looked." 

"What'd you think? She attractive?" asked Kurt. 

"Hard to tell, just like Martin said. She certainly wasn't ugly, just kind of plain. One day she wore a tee-shirt; it looked like she might have an OK rack. But I don't know." 

"How was she as a student?" asked Martin. 

"Excellent, actually; except that she'd never participate in class discussions. Her papers were pretty fucking brilliant though." 

"Does this ever get dirty?" asked Roger with a sigh. 

"Yes. In fact it was in her assignments where things started getting weird. It started early in the semester, when I had them do a poem. Hers was good - wonderful word choice, powerful imagery, lovely rhythm - pretty amazing, especially considering it was entirely about masturbating. And I mean graphically. At the time I thought she was brave to be so achingly honest in her subject matter so I gave her an A. That was my first mistake. 

"Her next assignment was worse. The main character goes to talk to her professor - who was described exactly like me - and he forces her to give him a blowjob. Again, the story was well written so I felt she deserved a good grade, but I told her she needs to keep the subject matter down to an 'R' rating, at the very least." 

"Jesus," said Ernie. 

"Then, another assignment comes along and she's even dirtier. Again I'm a character in the story but now I'm forcibly screwing her in every hole while she begs for mercy but, as she made amply clear in the story, she secretly loves every minute of it. I sent her a comment that she needs to cut that crap out, although, again, I still gave her a good grade. 

"It continued to get worse. I spoke to her after class and told her to stop. I explained how uncomfortable she was making me. I told her that what she was doing was sexual harassment and if she didn't stop I'd have to take my complaint to administration. " 

"What'd she say?" asked James. 

"Nothing. She stammered a few 'yes sirs' and 'no sirs' but mostly she stared at her shoes and looked contrite. I thought I'd reached her. I thought she'd stop. 

"She didn't? I hope," said Roger. 

"Oh no. Each story still got filthier and filthier. They got really, really twisted by the end of the semester." 

"Holy fuck. Why didn't you say anything to the department?" asked James. 

"By the time it was so out of control that I felt like I needed help, I'd already let it go too long. I worried I could be accused of leading the girl on. So I hemmed and hawed until my only option was to ride it out until the end of the semester. Now it's over. Thank God." 

"Wait a goddamned minute here...," said Roger. "You had this young thing writing you personally crafted pornography and you did nothing? Holy fuck!" 

"The girl obviously has mental problems." 

"Which you exacerbated by giving her A's for her weird little flights of fancy! If you'd've taken her aside and pounded her in her tight little cunt it might have at least have taught her a valuable lesson about being a clueless fucking cock-tease." 

"Fuck you, dude," said Martin. 

"Jesus guys, lighten up. We're here to have fun," said Joel. 

"Yeah, you're right. I apologize," said Roger. "And to make it up to the rookie I'm going to let him get me some ice." 

Everyone looked confused by the logic of that. 

"Meaning: I got plenty of vodka and tonic, but not enough ice. And I've already knocked back a few so I'm in no shape to drive. If Marty runs up to the Quick Trip and gets me a bag of ice I promise to not be an asshole for the rest of the night." 

Martin looked at his beer. He'd barely touched it and everyone else already seemed moderately buzzed. The logic of it was stupid but inescapable. He'd have to get Roger his God dammed ice. 

"OK, give me some money." 

Roger pulled himself off the couch, marched over to the pile of jackets and dug around until he brought out a ten. He handed it to Martin, saying "I'll want my change back." 

Grumbling under his breath, Martin left. 

Joel turned to Roger. "What are you up to man? We have plenty of ice." 

"True. But I was able to snag Martin's phone from his jacket," said Roger as he held up a scuffed-up phone. 

"What are you going to do with that?" 

"I'll show you. Hey, who does this sound like: 'Jill Coode obviously has mental problems'?" 

James, Kurt and Ernie broke out laughing at Roger's mimicry of Martin. Joel looked concerned. 

"Roger, you better not..." 

"Hey, I wonder if Jill Coode is in the student directory," interrupted Roger. 

"Already looked her up," said Ernie holding up his phone. The NMCC directory app was open, showing the student profile for Jill Coode. No picture available, it said, but there was a phone number. 

*** 

Jill Coode sat on her bed in her basement bedroom trying to write. Her story had just got to the good part: the princess was cornered and defenseless in her tower and the wild-eyed barbarians, smeared with the gore of her ineffectual defenders, were advancing ominously, lust twisting their hideous features into demonic countenances. But upstairs her grandfather's TV blared at full volume and every detail of Jessica Fletcher's latest case, circa 1987, came squawking down into Jill's brain. She looked at the clock and saw it was still before nine. There'd be yet another episode of Murder She Wrote before her granddad went to bed and she'd finally be able to think. 

Jill sighed. Perhaps she could outline some story ideas until then, or proofread, or something. She opened the browser on her laptop and went to one of the free porno sites she liked, maybe they'd have a good video or something to spark her imagination. She was looking through lurid thumbnails of group sex scenes when her cell phone rang. 

Jill jumped in alarm. Her phone never rang. Her granddad might call to check up on her when she was at school or attempting to do something social (although there hadn't been any of that since her disastrously tongue-tied attempts in the Fall semester), but he was upstairs watching MSW. If he wanted her, he'd just yell down the stairs. He certainly wasn't reluctant to do that. 

Jill picked up the phone. The caller ID said it was from 'Martin Demarest'. Her mouth dropped open. Martin Demarest? Her creative writing teacher? AKA: Professor Dreamy? She took a deep breath and answered, not wanting to hope but unable to help herself. 

"H-hello?" 

"Jill?" said a voice. "Jill Coode?" 

"Yes?" 

"This is Martin Demarest." 

"...Huh?" 

"This is Martin Demarest, Jill, your creative writing professor." 

Jill listened closely, scowling. "No it's not." 

"Um... I assure you..." 

"W-who is this really?" 

"..." 

"Hello? Who is this?" 

"Eh, actually I'm a colleague of Martin's. He stepped away and we thought we'd play a joke on him with one of his students... so we, uh, randomly picked ..." 

"No you didn't," she said, her voice a harsh, low whisper. 

"What?" 

"You didn't randomly pick me... professor Demarest t-t-told you about my stories, d-didn't he?" 

"Uh... well... He did, um, he mentioned them, yes." 

Jill swallowed hard and steadied herself before she allowed herself to speak further. But still her squeaky, halting voice betrayed her. "So what do... what do you w-want?" 

There was a flustered pause suddenly interrupted by a distant thud, then a voice from afar raised in anger. "What the hell are you doing with my phone!" 

Now that sounded like professor Demarest's voice. 

Sounds of struggle. Swearing and fumbling. Then his voice again, speaking right into the phone. "Hello? Who is this? This is Martin Demarest, was someone representing themselves as me?" 

"Hello professor," said Jill. Weird things seemed to be going on. Professor Demarest actually seemed more flustered than she. Jill steadied herself and spoke with a timid, coquettish confidence rare for her. "Have you been telling your friends about my stories?" 

"Listen, Jill. Don't..." 

"It's OK professor. Really." 

"Oh?" 

"Yes. Was there anything that... that m-maybe..." Jill halted, impossibly tongue tied again. 

"Jill, this isn't..." 

"Where are you now?" 

The professor said nothing for a long while. Jill would have worried that he'd hung up, but she could hear his breath. Then, finally, he responded: "Two- eighty-four, North Pierce Drive." 

He was only a few blocks away! "Thank you Professor," she said. "I'll be there in about an hour and a half. OK?" 

"No, Jill, you don't need to..." 

"You remember my stories, don't you professor?" she responded. 

"Yes. Of course I do." 

"I thought they were pretty clear." 

"Yes, Jill. They were that." 

"Good. So, how many of you are there?" 

"...Six." 

"Oh," she said as she imagined six men waiting for her at two-eight-four North Pierce. She swallowed heavily. "OK. See you in a w-while then," she said and hung up before Professor Demarest could change his mind. 

As Jill put her phone down she heard the creak of the loose riser on the basement stairs. She composed herself before her grandfather got to her door. 

"Hello grandfather," she said as he walked in without knocking. 

"Did I hear your phone?" he asked. 

"One of my professors called. I'd sent my final assignment to the wrong email address. He wanted to check on it before he gave me an incomplete." 

"He? I don't know that I like grown men calling you at night like that." 

"He was just doing his job." 

"Jilly, honey, you're such a naïve girl. You just watch yourself. Just 'cause a man has an education doesn't make him a good man." 

"He said the grades needed to be submitted before midnight," she said, her voice very small. 

"Maybe so, maybe so. But you still need to be wary, Jill. Any man will say anything to get at your virtue. And any girl might say 'no' dozens of times but when you have unscrupulous men filling your head with sweet talk day after day it's too much for the feminine brain. God knows, your mother couldn't resist. I just thank God every day that you didn't turn out to be a attractive girl like her. I know it doesn't seem like it, but The Lord did you a great favor, my dear, when he denied you your mother's good looks. You should thank Him extra hard tonight." 

"Yes, grandfather. I will." 

Upstairs, they could hear the 9PM rerun of Murder She Wrote starting. 

"Well, I gotta go catch my show, honey. Remember what I said" He turned and started back up the stairs. 

How could I forget? thought Jill. You tell me every frickin' day. 

She lay back on her bed, gripped the mattress and waited for her panic attack to run its course. 

*** 

Stag Night had entered a holding pattern. No one believed that a timid freshman girl, when given nearly two hours to consider her upcoming 'appointment' with six horny professors, would really go through with it. But neither did they want to end up too drunk to perform if she actually did, so they drank cola or coffee or water, played a few hands of poker, argued again about which pornos to watch and petulantly agreed with each other how pathetic they were for falling for the whims of a teenage cock-tease like Jill Coode. Eventually Martin remembered he still had the semester's assignments saved on the college network. The guys turned off the video and took turns reading her stories to each other. 

"God damn," said Roger, a while later. "That horny little slut sure can write! We're gonna have some fun if she ever shows." 

"She'll show," said Martin. 

James arched an eyebrow. "Really? What makes you think so?" 

"Just a feeling. When I spoke with her she was weirdly confident. She was almost pushy. I've never seen her show so much spirit. I think we struck a nerve." 

"You going to be able to go through with it if she shows up?" asked Joel. 

"Yeah, you sounded like you were trying to talk her out of it on the phone," said Kurt. 

"Why the hell do all of you think I'm terrified of fucking this girl?! Yeah, I'm a little worried we're taking advantage of her quite-possibly-fucked-up mental state, but I've been getting cock-teased for three fucking months. Believe me, I more ready to fuck Jill Coode than any of you can possibly imagine!" 

Several of the guys laughed. Martin felt a little ridiculous about his outburst but he managed a smile. 

"Well, that's a relief. We've got the rookie on board. Now all we need is the girl," said Roger. "Personally, I'd..." 

Martin's phone rang. They all jumped slightly in their seats at the sound. Martin picked up his phone. "It's Jill," he announced to the guys. Into the phone he said, "Hello Jill." 

"I'm outside," said Jill's squeaky voice into Martin's ear. She hung up. 

"She's outside," said Martin to the guys. 

They all looked at the door. 

"Um... I was thinking," said Joel. "Before we let her into my house, maybe we should ask her explicitly if she's cool getting fucked by us all? I mean, we're all kind of assuming that's what's going to happen. I'd prefer it be out in the open." 

"I hate to admit it, but that's not a bad idea," said Roger. 

James and Ernie nodded. 

"Jeez. And you guys accused me of being the timid one," grumbled Martin as he dialed the phone. 

*** 

Out on the front porch Jill shivered in the unseasonably cool May night. She was nervous, terrified really, and it surprised her. She'd been dreaming and hoping for this opportunity for so long and, now that it was here, she felt both a lingering disbelief that it would actually happen and a bone-deep panic that it was mere minutes away. 

Her phone rang. She answered. 

"Jill," said Martin Demarest. 

"What is it Professor Demarest?" She said. "I'm outside. Waiting." 

"We just want to be sure..." 

Jill interrupted him. "Please don't make me ask for it Professor Demarest." 

"What?" 

"That would ruin it. I wrote the... I wrote those s-stories so I wouldn't have to ask. I was v-very clear, wasn't I? J-just don't make me say the words, OK? Please." 

"OK... I guess..." 

"Thank you, Professor Demarest," she said and ended the call. She sighed. 

She heard voices arguing indistinctly through the door. She shook her head. She'd never have guessed a bunch of grown men would act so nervous in a situation like this. It was never like this in porno films. 

Finally, there was the click of the lock. The front door opened. Six men stood looking out at her. The disbelief in their eyes mirrored Jill's own. She tried to force a smile but her lips just quivered. 

The guys stepped back from the doorway to admit Jill, looking her over as she stepped hesitantly into the room. She had worn her knee-length, oversized knit jacket that hung off her like a tent and some plain flat-soled shoes. Her long, brown hair was in her usual style: shapelessly crowded around the edges of her face like curtains she would prefer to keep drawn. She had used make-up for a change, but not much: lipstick, a little eyeliner. She gazed intently at her hosts through her plastic-framed glasses, looking for, but not expecting, any sign of approval. 

"Hello Jill," said Martin. 

"Hi Professor D-Demarest," said Jill. She attempted a smile. 

"May I take your coat?" 

Jill swallowed heavily. Her pulse hammered in her ears. This is it. Back at home she had agonized over what to wear. She wanted to look sexy and confident but everything she owned was oversized, loose, frumpy. So, she'd chosen the only option available and now it was the moment of truth. Unable to speak, she nodded 'yes' as she reached for the top button with a shaking hand. Six pairs of watching eyes grew wider with every button. At last she shrugged the jacket off her shoulders and let it drop to the floor. She resisted the urge to vomit as she stood nude in the center of the room while six men inspected her body from mere feet away. 

It was an awful lot of attention for a girl like Jill. Too much. Instinctually her shoulders scrunched forward, her head slumped down, her arms drifted around to cover her breasts, her hands clasped together in front of her pubis. Her pale skin blushed vivid pink as her terrified eyes darted between the members of her wide-eyed, slack-jawed audience. 

The big, older guy with the beard sighed loudly. "You are severely pissing me off young lady!" he said. He stepped towards her. Jill stepped back. 

"Hey, back the fuck off Roger," warned Martin. 

"Please, allow me a minute Demarest. Just look at this girl! She has the body of a goddess, yet she tries to hide behind herself like a frightened pup. It's a God-damned shame!" Roger stepped up behind her. Jill cowered. "Stand up straight, my dear, yes that's right. Shoulders back, chest out... oh my yes. Gentlemen, please take your seats, before we do anything we need to teach this young woman some confidence. James, my man, would you grab that mirror over there and put in front of the TV, yes that's the stuff."  

===

The men took their seats as Jill stood nude and at attention. James moved the tall, free-standing mirror as requested. Roger, still behind Jill, put his hands on her shoulders and guided her to a spot in directly in front of it. 

"Have you ever looked at your body, my dear. Look with me now. See? Your skin: beautiful blue-veined alabaster," his hands glided gently along her thigh as he spoke to her from over her shoulder. She twitched nervously as his hands began to roam across her body. "Your belly has the effortless firmness of youth..." his hand slipped along the quivering flesh of her abdomen and circled back beneath her belly button. "But your hips have the voluptuousness of womanhood..." his hand stroked along her hipbone and continued to move up her body. "And your breasts! Round, full, pert... Perfection, my dear." His hand cupped her under her right breast, his thumb barely brushing the edge of her areola. "Perfection." 

Mortified at first, Jill followed along his tour of her flesh with a growing interest. When he phrased it like that then, yeah, she supposed she had an OK body. But what really got her interest were the watching eyes of her audience. They had followed along, wide and unblinking, rapt, hungry. There was no doubt, they wanted her. She realized she was getting very wet. Her skin tingled like it was on fire whenever the hairy old pervert touched her. She wanted him, or any, or all of them, to touch her more, a lot more. 

"Thank you," she squeaked. 

"Tell me my dear, how old are you?" 

"N-nineteen. Since a couple of weeks ago." 

"Are you a virgin?" 

"No." 

"Glad to hear it. It would be a crime to keep a body like that to yourself. How many men have you had sex with?" 

"I... I've never actually had sex with anyone. But I've used a dildo on myself... a lot." 

The men passed around an odd look. Jill felt her brief fling with confidence rapidly falling apart. 

"So you like to masturbate, eh?" 

She nodded. 

"Good," said Roger. He took her right hand in his big paw and guided it towards her pussy. "Because I want you to make yourself come. And I want you to watch yourself do it. No, don't look at us, look at you." 

Jill's breath caught in her throat as she let him guide her fingers into her labia. Together their hands moved over the freshly-shaved skin of her pussy into the wet furrow of her sex. He brought her fingertips to the bud of her clit and pulled his hand away. "Go on," he said and she began to stroke, to tease and feel herself like she'd done a thousand times before in the shower, in her bed, in her car between classes. But this time was different. She could see her bare body undulate and shudder as it responded to her touch. She could see her breasts rising and falling with her rapidly increasing breath and her pale pink nipples harden and rise. She opened her legs a little so she could slide a finger inside herself and she heard the men sigh in appreciation. Behind her, The old hairy professor held her hips and pressed his pelvis against her butt. She could feel his arousal grow alarmingly. She leaned back against him as her body began to tingle in earnest. His big hands were on her breasts now, his fingers gently squeezing her nipples. Oh, how nice to be touched like that! She watched herself in the mirror as her body began to shake and writhe. She cried out softly as potent blast of blinding pleasure quaked through her. Her body trembled and twisted as her lips parted and an animalistic moan escaped her. Finally, she sagged back against the hairy old professor, letting his big hands keep her from dropping to the floor. 

"That was excellent my dear," said as he helped her down to a sitting position on scuffed up black leather ottoman at the center of the semi-circle of seated faculty. Jill, her eyes still dazed and unfocused in the afterglow of her orgasm, reached up to adjust her glasses and look about the room. 

The guys looked eager enough. She wished they'd go ahead and get to the good stuff. 

*** 

"Sorry for interrupting, rookie," said Roger to Martin as stepped away from the girl. "I cede the floor to you, sir." 

Everyone turned to Martin, their faces all reading "what next?" Martin realized he should have been thinking ahead but, frankly, he'd been too caught up in Jill's performance to think at all. Plus he'd just kind-of assumed Roger - attention-craving ham that he was - was stepping into the role of ringmaster for the duration of the party. He'd been a pretty annoyed at the time but now he genuinely wished Roger really had taken over. Let that hairy old bastard do crowd control, Martin just wanted to fuck Jill Coode. 

Martin stood up and looked down at Jill. As her eyes followed him, she raised her hands to sweep her hair from her face and tuck it behind the ear-pieces of her glasses. For some reason the gesture enchanted him. Maybe it was the act of raising her arms, which pulled her already-shapely breasts further up her chest; or maybe it was the playful/worried expression in her eyes or the way she chewed nervously on her pouty lower lip; or maybe it was just that she was completely naked and right there. Whatever it was, her usual plainness had been transformed into an aura of genuine desirability. He was transfixed. 

Again, it was a lot of attention for a girl like Jill. She seemed ready to curl up into herself again as she melted under Martin's horny stare. Her eyes were big and watery. Her tongue darted out to nervously lick her lips... 

That gave Martin an idea. He smiled down at Jill as it formed in his head. Jill dared a tremulous smile in return. 

"Jill?" 

"Yes Professor Demarest?" 

"It's time to suck all our cocks." 

She swallowed heavily. Her eyes darted around the room. 

"And after that, we're going to fuck you, Jill. We're going to fuck your mouth, your pussy... we'll probably fuck you in your ass too. We're going to come in you. We're going to come on you. When you leave here tonight, you'll be a real slut. A cum-dump. There's no going back now. It's going to happen, Jill. " 

Martin's heart was beating in double-time and his palms were sweaty. His cock was already hard in his briefs. He'd never spoken to a woman like that, much less a teenage virgin. 

Jill looked Martin in the eye. The corner of her mouth twitched upward and her eyes were lively and playful. But what she said was: "I'm afraid." 

"Yes. Yes you probably should be." He clenched his fists. Holy shit he wanted to fuck that eager little nerd. He wanted to fuck her so hard. 

"I call first!" blurted Kurt. 

"No," said Martin, reminded once again that there were other guys here. He turned and looked them over, considering. 

"Joel is the host tonight. He should go first," announced Martin. 

"Don't have to tell me twice!" said Joel as he jumped up. His hand was already pulling his dick out of his fly as he arose. "OK girlie, first B.J.?" he asked as he stepped up to her. 

She didn't look up at him. Her eyes were busy eyeing his semi-hard prick. She nodded 'yes'. 

"Just remember kid: lots of tongue, no teeth." 

"I'll do my best," squeaked Jill. 

*** 

Jill actually felt moderately confident. She'd seen several porno scenes where a inexperienced character is taught how to fellate a man and, of course, she'd practiced some on her dildos. It didn't seem too difficult. As the tall guy with the thick glasses held his cock out for her she graced the underside of his growing shaft with a few long licks, from balls to head, before eagerly slipping her lips around him. 

Immediately she could appreciate how very different this was from practicing on a dildo. She reveled in the new experience of the fleshy firmness of his manhood pistoning back and forth along her tongue. She loved the way it changed in size and solidity as his hardening glans rattled against her back molars. She even appreciated the musky smell of his maleness as the tip of her nose brushed against his unkempt pubic hair. Her heart raced as the soft slurps of her mouth merged with his groans and heavy breathing. 

"Holy fuck, baby," he said. "You're a natural." 

Jill smiled to herself around his cock as she felt the rim of his rock-hard head move back and forth within her mouth. She tasted a thin film of salty precum that began seeping from him. She wouldn't really say it tasted good, but she assumed she'd grow to like it soon enough. The girls in the pornos all said they loved it. 

"Whoa, Jill," said Joel, pushing her away. "Better ease off me for a while." 

Her former lit professor Dr. Basset, the black guy, jumped up and stood next to Joel. Jill turned and smiled up at him as she reached over to stroke Joel with her hand. 

"Open up, girl. I bet your daddy would love to see this," he said as he thrust his erection into her mouth. 

Who knows? she thought. As Grandfather is always so quick to point out, no one has any idea who my dad might be... Ha! What if that old fool could see this? It'd kill him. 

Jill reached down and started to strum her clit. 

As with Joel, James started leaking a lot of precum before long and he pulled himself from her mouth with a frustrated apology. His dark glistening cock withdrew, trailing shimmering filaments of spunk. 

Kurt, the muscular one with the missing finger on his left hand, jumped up next. His cock was already rock-hard. She opened her mouth but he slapped her on the nose with it instead. "No, bitch. Lick my balls," he said. He hitched a foot up on the ottoman to give her better access and pulled her face to his scrotum. She licked his sweaty sack with several long laps. He tasted stale and errant stands of pubic hair clung stubbornly to her tongue. She didn't mind. Kurt said he wanted it wetter. She continued licking, wetter now, so that her saliva dripped from his balls like glistening dew. He commanded her to suck one of his testes into her mouth. She pulled in one ball, then another and stroked them with her tongue. He made her lick up and down his taint. She felt woozy as she breathed in his musky smell but her skin tingled with desire all the same. 

Finally, after giving her a final few slaps across the face with his cock, Kurt pushed her away. Jill licked her lips. Who was next? She looked up and to her right. Standing above her she could see Professor Demarest through her glasses, now smudged with greasy dick prints and smears of precum. He was just finishing taking off his shirt and he stood there as nude as she. His body was lithe, his eyes were hot and eager, his cock was erect and waiting. Jill took his shaft by the base and eagerly sunk her face onto it. His was a little bigger than the previous three. She closed her eyes and began to frig her clit with renewed intensity as she got to work. 

*** 

Whatever trepidation Jill had been feeling had apparently melted away as she'd sucked her first three dicks. She'd shown nothing but all consuming cock-hunger when Martin had stepped up for his turn. He hated to admit it, but he had kind of liked when she looked a little frightened. A wicked idea popped into his brain. Without thinking, he placed his right hand firmly against the back of her head. 

"How deep you take my cock, Jill?" he heard himself say. 

With her lips still stretched around his manhood, her big eyes looked up at him in alarm. Now there was the expression he liked. He applied pressure. Her eyes got wider. A wet 'glurp' sound came from her as he felt his fat head push back past her tongue into uncomfortable territory at the back of her mouth. He felt her suppress a couple of gags. Damn, It felt good as her throat struggled to accept his cock. 

"Holy shit!" said several as his shaft pushed down her throat until her nose mashed into his abdomen. Martin moaned deeply. 

He pulled back and Jill gasped for breath. He let her get some air for awhile before he shoved it down again. Their eyes held each other as he slowly fucked her throat. Before long she was really getting into it, making weird moaning noises from somewhere in her chest. Martin felt his skin begin to tingle and his balls begin to ache with a rapidly building climax. Regretfully, He pushed Jill away and stepped back; so close to orgasm he had to look away else Jill's big, watery doe-eyes prompt him to shoot his load right there onto Joel's carpet. 

Martin stepped away from the action and looked T Joel's bookshelves for awhile as he waited for his near-orgasm to abate. Behind him he could hear Ernie taking his turn as Martin browsed the spines of books on number theory, chess strategy, Jewish history. It sounded like Ernie was giving her a really vigorous face-fucking, the 'gulk, gulk, gulk' of his jackhammer thrusts into her mouth filled the room. Martin finally returned to the tight circle of men standing around Jill just as Ernie swore and pulled away, his trembling dick dripping ribbons of precum. Jill's face was flushed and sweaty, her lips raw, her makeup smeared. She straightened her cum speckled-glasses again and looked up at the encircling men. 

"Who's next?" said Jill, her voice surprisingly clear and steady. 

Standing a little apart from the circle of men, Roger smiled. "Me," he said and stepped in closer. He opened his trousers and pulled down his boxers. Jill gasped. The men stood back. 

"Holy shit, Roger!" said Joel. 

"Yeah, I know, I know," said Roger. "I got a really big dick." 

As the guys laughed, Jill approached it and took his shaft in both hands. She began licking around the head, tentatively testing getting her lips around it. It was obvious from her actions that the thing both intrigued and terrified her. 

"Hold on kid, I got a better idea," he said as he pushed her back so his head popped from her mouth. He brought out a bottle of baby oil and dribbled a healthy slick of it onto Jill's heaving chest. Lifting his heavy cock he let it flop against her sternum with a wet slap. He grabbed her soft, pale breasts, pushed them together around his shaft and began tit-fucking her slowly. Jill used the break from having her mouth full of cock to catch up on her breathing. Her chest rose and fell with her labored breaths as she gazed down with fevered interest at the huge oily cock pumping between her boobs. 

"You like that?" asked Roger. 

"Yeah," said Jill, looking up at him with a cute, mischievous smile. 

"Well, you'll like this next bit even more," He said with a smile. Looking up he said, "Come on boys, let's get her up on the table." 

"Hold on a minute, you can't fuck her with that monster of yours!" complained Joel. "I mean, you can't go first anyway." 

"Of course not. I just want to eat her pussy before we move onto that. Fresh young quim is a rare delicacy for me these days." 

Jill looked up at Roger, startled. She squirmed excitedly as several sets of hands lifted her off her ottoman and laid her face up on the dining room table. Roger stepped up and pulled her legs open. Standing between her thighs and looking down at her, he rubbed his bristly beard and mustache and laughed. "That's right girlie, you're in for a real treat." 

He lowered his face to her pussy and began to sup. His tongue delved and slipped between her labia and flicked and circled her clit as the bristles of his mustache and beard teased and tickled the extraordinarily sensitive flesh of her pussy. Her mouth dropped open and her eyes went blank as hitherto unknown levels of pleasure visibly pulsed through her. The other men gathered around and attempted to get her interested in stroking their members with her idle hands or suck their balls with her upturned mouth, but her attention was too fixated on her first experience with cunnilingis to be much help. 

James brought the baby oil over and sprayed more of it on her tits and several of the guys amused themselves with the slick feel of her pale, soft skin sliding beneath their fingers as she writhed in pleasure beneath them. She began to cry out little gulps of delight which evolved into deep moans and finally high-pitched screams of ecstasy as Roger brought her to climax. When he stood his mustache and beard were soaked. Jill lay panting uncontrollably, her body flushed a bright pink and shining under a thick layer of oil and sweat. She looked quite fuckable. 

"Dibs!" shouted Ernie. 

"No fucking way, dude," said Martin. "I found her, I'm doing her first." Jill looked up and her eyes met his. A hot, hungry look passed between them. 

Martin stepped between Jill's thighs. He looked down at Jill's pussy: open, wet and ready. He let his erection lay against it as he looked down into Jill's upturned face. He thought of her stories, so many of them had a scene like this: a young girl, surrounded by horny men, waiting to be violated. There was one detail that was not quite right. Eager to give Jill exactly what she wanted he turned to his companions and told them: "grab her legs and arms. Hold her down. Stretch her out." 

Jill squirmed as they took her limbs in their hands and restrained her and pulled her body tight. Martin played with her pussy with his erection for a little bit, dragging it through the silky slime of her sex and slapping her clit. Finally he lined his glans up with her gates of pleasure and eased forward. Jill's breath caught in her throat as she felt his head disappear inside her. 

*** 

It's happening! thought Jill. All the hopeless waiting, all the wretched attempts to get boys to talk to or even notice her, all the frustrated masturbation, all the overheated fantasies, it had all led to this. She moaned aloud as she felt Professor Demarest's manhood sink into her body. 

It's happening! I'm It's finally, finally happening! 

*** 

Martin eased himself inside Jill. The men looked down and watched her muscles constrict under soft, pale skin as his cock sunk into her inch after inch. When he came to rest with his cock buried fully inside her, the girl finally allowed herself a panting breath. He swiveled his hips, stirring up her insides with his shaft, and her back arched luridly over the table. 

He began fucking her with slow, deep thrusts. She whimpered and cooed as he filled her. He reached out to play with her nipples and tug on her tits as they shook and gyrated under his movement. She began to moan. He slipped a hand down her lower abdomen to where his thumb could brush across her clit on each of his thrusts. She cried out. "Ohhhh... yeeeessss..." and groaned as he picked up the pace, slamming into her now as she bucked back against him. The men holding her limbs in their oily hands hung on for dear life. They all watched as her pale skin bloomed in pink again and her body began to shake. Martin could feel her pussy begin to clamp around his shaft as she came yet again. it was too much. He pitched forward at the waist as he began pumping his last four day's backlog of sperm into her young body. He didn't stop pumping until he felt he'd been milked dry. When he stepped back and his limp prick fell free, a viscous flow of sperm gushed from her gaping hole and slid down along her ass crack. 

"Shit man, you filled her up," said Joel. 

"Yuck. Messy," said Ernie with a frown. 

*** 

Jill felt Professor Demarest's essence leaking from her. She imagined his sperm in her womb, searching even now to ruin her life as her mother's had been ruined. She'd need to go to the college health office tomorrow and get one of those morning-after pills. Or maybe she'd just take her chances; the idea of risking her life on the crap-shoot now going on inside her uterus gave her a weird, uneasy thrill. 

*** 

"Sorry about the sloppy seconds," said Martin, not actually sounding - or feeling - particularly sorry. 

"You buncha pussies," said Roger as he got between Jill's thighs again. "What the hell were you expecting?" he lined up is cock and ran it into her down to his balls in one wicked push. 

"Aiiiie!" squealed Jill as the helmet of his cock slammed against her cervix. "Too deep. Too deep!"  

===

"Easy child, that's just the preliminary." Roger pulled his cock from her. Wet with her juice and thick clotted strands of Martin's semen, it glistened and stank as he brought to her face. As he held it over her a thick dollop of cum dripped onto the center of the right lens of her glasses. "Clean it up, slut," he said. 

*** 

Jill looked up at the thing and her heart beat quickened as her stomach lurched wildly. Hesitantly, she extended her tongue and ran it up the filthy underside of Roger's big, dirty dick. She had tasted herself on some of her dildos before, when she was in the depths of a late-night masturbatory fantasies, and she'd gotten a taste of semen from all the precum that had leaked into her mouth mere minutes ago, but this was different, so very different. The comingled musk of her and Professor Demarest's cum was like a drug. She hummed hungrily as she lapped it up and supped it down. As she was doing this, someone stepped between her thighs and pushed his cock deep inside her and her groans of approval rose in intensity. 

"This bitch is so fucking hot for cock," she heard one of them - she couldn't tell which - say as he pumped her lustily. There was a murmur of agreement. 

The cock clean, Jill did her best to fellate Roger. But he pushed her head away and pulled his cock from her mouth. "No, girlie, I have other plans for you." 

Moving over and straddling her head so his balls hung right in her face, he dropped his huge erection between her well-oiled breasts with a sharp splat. Pushing them together around his shaft, he began tit-fucking her again. 

"Yes, I do enjoy a good tit-fuck," said Roger as he worked his meat between her soft, pale mounds. "Lick my balls, my dear... and don't forget my taint... Yes that's the stuff. Holy shit, I'm not going to... ungh." 

Roger stepped back and grasped his cock as a flood of jizz erupted onto Jill's trembling tits. She felt hot heavy gobs of it course down the sides of her boobs in fast flowing, viscous rivulets to hang from her flesh in thick, congealing strands. It felt gross. It felt awesome. 

With Roger's balls out of her face she could see the short, ugly one - Ernie, they called him - between her thighs, slamming his cock into her. Their eyes met. "Hey, slut, I think I wanna blow my load on your pretty face," He said with a cruel grin. He pulled his cock from her and moved around the table. She obediently let her mouth drop open and waited for him. 

"You mind if we flip her over?" asked Joel. He had stepped up for his turn, his firm cock in hand. 

No one minded so Jill felt the hands that were pinning her arms and legs to the table release their grip and ease her onto her hands and knees back on the ottoman. Joel got behind her and slipped his prick in as Ernie grabbed two handfuls of her hair and began vigorously face fucking her. It wasn't long before Ernie took a step back and brandished his florid cock at her. She let her mouth drop open and closed her eyes, waiting for his flood. As he began gushing jets of pearly spunk into her mouth and across her face she felt Joel slip an oily finger into her sphincter. 

"Unnngh," she moaned as he began to work her ass open. Strands of cum hung from her nose and jaw. She swallowed what was in her mouth. 

James Basset stepped up to her face. "Ready for me again, beautiful?" He asked. She nodded and took his thick black cock into her mouth. 

"Hey, Basset, I just gotta fuck this ass, you want a poke at her pussy?" said Joel as they pumped the girl's filthy, sweat slickened body from both ends. 

"Hells yeah," said James. 

Jill's stomach did a double-flip. 

Dr Basset - James - backed up and sat on the couch. Jill was carried over and placed astraddle his lap. They wiped the congealed spunk from her face and tits with discarded tee-shirt and took her filthy glasses away. Blind now, Jill reached down and found Dr Basset's cock with her hand. It felt so wonderful as she tested his firmness in her fingers and slipped it back along her crease to her vag, where she let it penetrate her slowly, filling her trembling body with dusky flesh. She was terrified as Joel squatted down behind her, lined his shaft up with her ass and slowly pushed himself inside. It was horribly uncomfortable. She squealed a bit as her pelvis strained to contain them both and the tender barrier of skin between her vagina and rectum was pummeled between their pumping cocks. Her cries turned to wet gurgles as Kurt stepped up and shoved his prick into her gaping mouth. 

Slowly, the pain started to dull, Jill closed her useless eyes and let herself be driven by the men pumping her in every hole. Soon her body began to rumble with a gathering storm of pleasure and she began to pump back, rocking her pelvis and bobbing her head along with the grinding rhythm they'd settled upon. The men spoke to each other as if she wasn't there, reporting on the wetness of her pussy, the tightness of her ass, the depth of her throat. They called her slut, whore, bitch, cunt. She grew wetter and wetter at the abuse. Finally she could hold back no longer and her body broke their mutual cadence to thrash wildly in the center of that knot of sweating, thrusting men. As her body clenched, Joel and James both lost their fight against their own orgasms and simultaneously began pumping their seed deep inside her. The wail of three simultaneous climaxes filled the room 

Dr. Basset just came in me too! Oh god, what if I got pregnant now and had a black baby!? 

They disengaged from each other; the men standing up, Jill sliding exhaustedly to the floor. She looked up at the surrounding ring of men but she could see precious little without her glasses. She smiled up at the blurry figures gazing down on her. She couldn't help it. A deep feeling of euphoria coursed through her body and mind. She didn't want it to end. 

Then she spotted Kurt. He was still standing close. His cock was still hard. He was looking down at her, stroking himself thoughtfully. 

"How do you want me?" she asked. 

*** 

"Well Kurt," said Roger. "Answer the girl." 

"And hurry up, I want to play some poker now," said Ernie. 

"Shit, I thought we just poked 'er plenty," said James. Several groaned. 

Martin said nothing. He just looked down at Jill spread out on Joel's threadbare rug. Her face was lively and eager, her body relaxed but ready. He felt his cock begin to stir again. 

Kurt seemed to come to a decision. He shrugged, mumbled "fuck it" and ordered Jill to stick her legs in the air. He grabbed her feet and pulled them to his mouth. He began kissing and sucking her toes. 

"Holy shit, you have beautiful feet... I bet you never wear heels," he moaned as he slipped his tongue between her toes and kissed along the sole of her feet. Jill squirmed considerably, obviously she was a bit ticklish. 

Finally he placed her feet in front of him, sole to sole, grabbed the bottle of baby oil and poured on a heavy helping. It dripped from her heels and ran in thick flows down her legs. He then slid his cock between her soles and began to pump lustily, yelping with a whimpering grunt on each thrust. It wasn't a minute before he groaned and began raining cum down on Jill's prone body. Her eyes were wide with surprise. 

The other guys exchanged a few odd glances during all this. 

"Jeez, Kurt. I would not have pegged you for the kinky one," said Roger as Kurt let go of Jill's feet and stood back. 

Kurt shrugged. "Whatever," he said as he walked naked into the kitchen to get a beer. 

*** 

For Jill, the time just after her first gangbang would always be the highlight of that particular night. 

Martin swooped down to help her up off the floor and escort her to the bathroom. "I'm going to help Jill clean up," he told his colleagues as he shut the door behind them, not waiting for a response. 

He started the shower and took a few seconds to get the temperature right. He invited Jill in and stepped in behind her. Their arms interlaced as they began to wash each other thoroughly and eagerly. They embraced. Under the hot water, their lips met. They kissed. It was Jill's first. 

They kissed a long time. It had never occurred to Jill - a sexual autodidact via copious porn consumption - that a kiss could be as thrilling as a fuck. But as their lips mashed and slipped together and their tongues probed and pried at each other she realized how little she'd really learned by mere watching. Martin had more to teach her than mere English composition and she was eager to learn. 

As they kissed she let her hand stray down and test Martin's manhood. It was growing firm again. Their eyes met as she held his shaft. He pulled her closer. Soon the sounds of their lovemaking was echoing around the shower and the repeated slamming of her body against the tile was disturbing the poker game on the other side of the less-than-soundproof wall. 

On the other side of the wall, Roger put down the cards he was shuffling and shot a wry look at groans, cries and thumps coming from the bathroom. "And to think, I'd thought that guy was such a total pussy," he said and began dealing. 

*** 

It was really over now. They were saying their goodbyes. The guys seemed like they were feeling a little freaked out about what they'd all done in front of each other and they acted all awkward and weird as they thanked her and asked if she'd be OK walking home. Jill's legs were rubbery and her body exhausted and more than a little sore, but she assured them she'd be fine. It wasn't far. The neighborhood was safe. 

They followed her out into the night. On the porch she gave each a chaste little peck on the mouth before turning and slouching exhaustedly toward the sidewalk. When she got halfway down the walk she stopped and turned. 

"Oh, hey, I was wondering... is next week's party going to be here as well?" she asked. 

They guys looked at each other. The faculty stag was a once-a-semester event. Or, rather, it had been, until just now. Their faces broke out in horny smiles as they answered in the affirmative, six voices speaking as one.
