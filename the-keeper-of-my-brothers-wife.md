 ****** The Keeper of My Brother's Wife ****** byJust_Plain_BobÂ© He walked into the bar and looked around. As his eyes became accustomed to the low level of the lighting and he was able to see into some of the darker recesses of the place he saw her. She was sitting at a table in the back corner and she wasn't alone. But then he hadn't really expected her to be. The guy sitting next to her had his arm draped across her shoulders and his right hand was caressing her right breast. He kept his eyes on the two of them as he stepped to the bar and ordered a Coors Light. Taking a sip of the beer he looked around the bar trying to get a feel for the place. Two middle aged guys in John Deere caps sitting at the other end of the bar, two young couples sitting in a both along the east wall of the joint, and the bartender. He wasn't looking for trouble, but it never hurt to know where some might come from. He took a long pull on the beer, set the empty down on the bar and headed for the table in the back corner.

 "You are out of your fucking mind!" 

 Donny winced and looked around. "Hold your voice down. You get too loud and the Deputy will ask you to leave." 

 I looked over at the Deputy monitoring the visiting room and saw him looking at us. Keeping my hands in plain sight like I'd been instructed I turned and looked back at my brother. "Maybe that would be best. Get out of here before I have to listen to any more of this nonsense." 

 "Come on Bobby, you're the only family I got. Who else can I ask?" 

 "It doesn't matter Donny, it is an impossible task. It wouldn't matter who you asked to do it; it just can not be done! Christ Donny, you're married to her and you couldn't do it so how in the hell do you expect me to?" 

 "That's different Bobby. I love her and I can't bring myself to use a heavy hand with her. You don't even like her so it shouldn't bother you." 

 "Bother me? Why should I think it would bother me? You are married to the bitch and she got you thrown in jail. I got no claim on her at all Donny. I try to sit on her and I'll end up in here sharing a cell with you." 

 "It ain't like that Bobby. The only reason I'm in here is because the asshole she was with is a Deputy Sheriff and even then I wouldn't be in here if I hadn't broken his arm. Cindy is scared right now. Her fooling around never caused anything like this before and she'll listen to you. You got to do this for me Bobby. I love her and I got to know that she will still be there when I get out." 

 I just sat there and looked at the dumb bastard and wondered why he couldn't just pray that she would be gone when he had done his time. Cindy was a round- heeled slut, was one before Donny married her, and her wedding vows hadn't changed a thing. My brother was right when he said he knew that I didn't even like her, but I don't believe that he knew the real reason why. Cindy started coming on to me the night of the wedding reception and in the six years that she and Donny had been married she hadn't stopped trying. The real reason I didn't like her was because of what she did to me. I wanted the beautiful whore - I wanted her bad - and she knew it and played it for all it she was worth. But no matter how hard she tried and how much I wanted her she was still my brother's wife. That thought gave me an idea. 

 "Donny, you know she runs around on you. She's a slut and nothing you have done up till now has changed that. The only way I can make sure that she is here when you get out is to move in with her or have her move in with me so I can sit on her. What happens then? You know and I know that sooner or later she will end up in my bed. What then?" 

 Donny turned his head away and said, "Do what you gotta do Bobby, just make sure that she's there when I get out." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Cindy was not pleased when I showed up at the house and told her she had some choices to make. I'm pretty sure that she had been looking forward to 120 days (minus time off for good behavior) of unrestrained unfaithfulness so it came as a small shock to her to find out that I was going to be her babysitter. I told her what Donny had asked of me and then I spelled it out for her. "You can either move in with me or I'll move in with you. Your only other option is to pack your bags and leave town. As long as you are in this town and I can find you I will rain on your parade. So, if you stay in town the choices are my place or yours." 

 "Get real Bobby. You can't watch me twenty-four hours a day unless you quit your job." 

 "No, but I can keep a pretty close eye on you when I'm not working and I can spread the word that I'll not take kindly to anyone having anything to do with you while you are, what shall we say, under my protection?" 

 "But why? Why do you care?" 

 "Because my brother asked me to." 

 There was a lot of pouting and whining from Cindy and I finally said, "Why don't you just make it easy on everybody and get a divorce? I know Donny loves you and is afraid of losing you, but you obviously don't give a shit about him. Why not take advantage of the fact that he is going to be in jail for the next 90 to 120 days and leave him?" 

 "I can't." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because you're wrong, I do care for him. In fact, I love him to death." 

 You could have knocked me over with a feather when I heard her say that. I stood there staring at her and she said, "It's true, I love him." 

 "How can you stand there and say that when everyone knows that you cheat on him every chance you get?" 

 "I can't help it Bobby. I need sex, a lot of sex, and Donny just doesn't give it to me. Twice a week, regular as clockwork, three minutes and then he rolls off, goes to sleep and leaves me hanging. I married him because I love him, but even before we were married he wasn't giving me what I needed. I just have to go out and find someone to fuck me and make me cum. If seeing to my own sexual satisfaction because my husband won't makes me a slut then so be it." 

 In the end she told me that she had no intention of not living in her own home so I could move in with her while Donny was still locked up. "But best you understand this Bobby, I am not going to make any allowances for you." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That night I moved in what I thought I'd need. The next day was Saturday and I didn't have to go to work. I found out as soon as I got up what Cindy had meant by her "make no allowances" remark. Cindy was already in the kitchen when I got there and she was naked as the day she was born. She saw my eyebrows go up and she said, "Get used to it. I'm usually naked when I'm home." Whether that was true or not or whether she was just pulling my chain I didn't know, but for the better part of the morning she just hustled around doing her housework nude and ignoring me. She took a shower around two and left the bathroom door open while she did and she left her bedroom door open while she dressed. I spent the whole fucking day with the mother of all hard ons and cussing myself for letting Donny talk me into being his watchdog. 

 About six that evening Cindy called me and asked me to come to her bedroom and help her do something. I walked in the room and found her in nothing but high heels, nylons and a garter belt. 

 "I need you to help me zip up," she said as she stepped into a black cocktail dress. 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "Out for some drinks and dancing." 

 "Dressed like that, no panties or bra?" 

 "When you are going fishing you have to use good bait." 

 "You know that I'm not going to let anyone near you." 

 "You will be near me and you have had a hard on all day. Who knows what might happen before we get home." Then she reached down and squeezed the bulge in my trousers, "Or we can skip going out and just get it on now. You know that you can't go the whole time Donny is gone without me getting you in my bed, at least as long as you stay here. What do you say, want to cut right to the chase?" 

 I pushed her away from me and went to grab a sport coat. 

 It was one of the worst evenings of my life. The bar she drove us to was jam- packed and had a loud and noisy rock and roll band. We were no sooner in the door when some guy Cindy knew grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to the dance floor. She tossed me her purse and told me to find us a table and then I spent the rest of the evening prying her away from guys who were determined to get her alone and fuck her. She went to the bathroom and when she wasn't back in what I thought was a reasonable time I went looking for her. I found her leaning against a wall just outside the woman's john while a guy kissed her and worked his hand up under her dress. Twice after a guy asked her to dance she disappeared off the dance floor and I found her in the parking lot. The first time I caught her just as she was climbing in to the guys back seat and the second time she was lying back on the hood of a car and the guy had his cock out and was getting ready to put it to her. Both times I had to get physical with the guys to get her away from them. Cindy was laughing at me as I drug her back into the bar the second time, "You think you can do this for another four months Bobby? The only way you are going to keep those cocks away from me is to do the job yourself. Come on Bobby, how about it. Let's just go home and make the bedsprings rattle. If you can go more than twice a week and three minutes at a time you can keep me off the streets until Donny comes home. Come on Bobby, what do you say?" 

 "I say you are a bitch and it ain't never going to happen." 

 Fifteen minutes later I caught her in a booth in a dark corner of the bar just getting ready to bend over and take a cock in her mouth. I totally lost it. I grabbed her arm and hauled her out of the booth and the guy she was with started to come out after me. I put a hand in the middle of his chest and shoved him back in the booth; "Best you stay in that booth asshole. You come out and you are going to the hospital. That's a fucking promise." 

 I pulled Cindy along to the bathrooms and shoved her into the ladies side and told her to clean herself up. While she was in there I used my cell phone to make several calls. When she came out I took her purse away from her, got out her car keys and then, with her kicking and fighting all the way, I took her home. I had to drag Cindy out of the car and carry her into the house and when I got her in her bedroom I tossed her on the bed and told her to strip. When I told her that she stopped struggling and got a smile on her face. 

 "I knew it, I knew you couldn't ignore me." She rolled over, "Unzip me lover." I pulled the zipper down and while she pulled the dress up over her head I unsnapped her garter belt and rolled her nylons down her legs. Cindy laid back on the bed and spread her legs, "Come on lover, show momma what you got. I got on the bed and straddled her sitting down on her chest. "Come on lover, get your clothes off and let's party." 

 I reached for her right arm, "I forgot to tell you that I'm a little kinky" as I tied one of her nylons around her wrist. 

 "Kinky is good, I can do kinky" she said as I tied the other end of the nylon to the bedpost. As I did the same to her left she said, "Hurry lover, hurry. I need it baby, I'm so hot I could explode." 

 When I had her tied to the bedposts I got off her and looked at my watch. As if on cue the front door bell rang and Cindy said, "Who the hell can that be at this time of night." 

 I smiled at her, "Your first customer." 

 "My first customer? What the hell does that mean?" 

 "It means that I'm going to see to it that you get what you want and help Donny at the same time. You want cock? I'm going to see to it that you get so much that you won't be able to walk and at the same time I'm going to make some money for Donny." I turned and left her to go answer the door. 

 It wasn't what Donny wanted me to do, well, not exactly. His main goal was for me to make sure that Cindy didn't find another boyfriend and leave him before he got out of jail. It only took me that Saturday to realize that there was no way I was going to be able to stay on top of Cindy and keep Cindy away from cocks. I already knew that she would still be there waiting when Donny got out - she had told me so herself - "I love him" - so the solution to the problem of keeping her from going out looking for cock was to keep her in and see to it that she got plenty. The phone calls I made while Cindy was in the bathroom were to guys who had at one time or another expressed a desire to fuck Cindy. Donny had another problem facing him when he got out of jail; he had been ordered to pay the medical bills of the man whose arm he broke. I opened the front door and found Tom and Joe standing there. 

 Joe said, "This is for real, right?" 

 "Absolutely. She's in the bedroom waiting" and I stuck out my hand and each of them handed me a hundred bucks. Why were they paying for something that Cindy normally spread around for free? Because even though Cindy was a round heeled slut she was a selective slut and she only went after young, good looking guys. Tom was fat and fifty and Joe was short, bald and over weight and they never ever would have gotten a taste of her - until now. 

 It was seven on Sunday morning when the party broke up. Donny's "hospital fund" had eleven hundred dollars in it when I closed the door behind the last man. I walked back to the bedroom and looked in on Cindy. Some time during the night the nylons had been untied and had come off. She didn't look all that worse for wear. Her pussy lips were reddish and a bit swollen and her pubic hair was wet and matted, but other than that she looked okay. She was asleep and she had a smile on her face. I pulled the covers up over her and then I went to the spare bedroom and went to bed. 

 I came awake suddenly in the middle of what I thought was a wet dream. But it wasn't a wet dream; Cindy had her mouth on my cock and her hands were playing with my balls. I glanced over at the bedside clock and saw that it was three in the afternoon. Half of me (48% actually) said to push her away, she's your brother's wife for God's sake," but I had told Donny that the possibilities were good that Cindy and I would end up in bed together and his response had been, "Do what you gotta do." I listened to the 48% for a about half a second and then the other 52% said, "Hey dude, your cock is hard and she is giving you some great head." 

 Majority rules, right? 

 "Oh good, you're awake," Cindy said as she swung over me and settled down on my dick. She began to ride me, "Told you lover. I told you that you would end up where you are. I do so hope that you aren't a three minute man lover because I plan on keeping you busy the rest of the day." 

 She started slamming down on me and I began to worry that I might indeed be a three-minute man. It had been a while since I was last laid and I just knew I was going to get off too quick. To buy myself some time I pushed her off me and rolled over on top of her. Being on top I was able to slow the pace down a little to buy me a little more time, but even so I only made it to four minutes. I came and Cindy cried out, "No, god damn it, no. Don't stop, I'm almost there." I pulled away from her and let my fingers do the walking until Cindy had her orgasm and settled down. 

 "What the fuck is it with the men in your family? Can't any of you keep it up?" 

 "I haven't rolled over and gone to sleep yet, have I?" 

 "You can go again?" 

 "As soon as it gets hard." 

 "I can help you there lover" and she changed position and began to give me head. It took her five minutes to get me back up, but I did rise to the occasion and the second bout lasted quite a bit longer and the third even longer than that. As we lay side by side looking up at the ceiling Cindy asked, "How many times more do you think we can go today?" 

 I glanced over at the bedside clock and said, "I don't know about me, but you are going to be good for at least twelve more. In fact your first appointment of the day should be here in about twenty minutes. You going to shower and put on some makeup or just give him my sloppy seconds?" 

 Cindy sat up, "What? What do you mean?" 

 I mean that a man is going to be here in twenty minutes and give me a hundred bucks to fuck you. After him there will be at least eleven more unless someone cancels out." 

 "Why? Why are you doing this to me?" 

 "Got to keep you busy sweetie. Got to keep you busy until Donny gets out." 

 She sat there staring at me as the import of what I'd just said sank in and then I saw something in her eyes. Her face didn't smile, but I was pretty sure that her eyes did. 

 "120 days huh? I guess I'd better get ready" and she dashed off to the shower. Report_Story
