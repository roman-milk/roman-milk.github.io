 ****** After Ripeness Fades ****** byfastandsloppyÂ© Many, many thanks to friend and fan Eric_Shift for suggesting the idea for this story . 

 *** 

 It was unfortunate that the season was still cold and raw. Jodi had only wanted one last walk along the stretch of what she had come to think of as "her" beach, but she'd forgotten that April could bring such wretched weather to the coast. Back in the city it was high spring with blossoming trees, balmy temperatures and randy birds singing in every tree. But here at the shore the angry waves and bitter wind ate away at the long sandy strip of land while screaming gulls swooped and circled, cheering like bloody-minded spectators at an un-refereed brawl. 

 The trail was corrugated in weathered pine boards and half buried in creeping dunes. Jodi flinched uselessly as gusts of wind tortured her legs with racing tendrils of rasping sand. It stung the flesh above her knee-high boots and swirled up her skirt. Cursing the outfit she had picked more for the mirror than for the weather, she gathered her sweater tighter to her torso and tried to pull her hem lower down her thighs. But finally she gave up, turning away from the walkway to head inland. It was just as well, her connection to this stretch of beach was finished; or it would be after today anyway. Her beloved beach house had fallen victim to a tighter budget as her income eroded to half its former grandeur then to half again. 

 Her agent had warned her this day would come. She'd implored her girls to plan for the future while the money was coming in easy; get an education, develop a talent, buy into a business, anything. But it was too easy to let the few years of peak ripeness slip by while pissing money away on clothes, cars, musician boyfriends and other useless trinkets. At least Jodi had made an investment. Not that she was making a fortune on the sale of her condo, but it would keep her fed while she found her feet in some yet-to-be determined new life. She shuddered as she thought of girls like Elsa, reduced to turning tricks as a call girl to pay off her debts and feed her habits. 

 As she left the path she spotted a single car in the parking lot back behind the dunes. It was a sad looking station wagon full aluminum cans, weathered glass, driftwood and other old trash. The owner was probably picking along the water's edge now, searching for flotsam spit up by the spring storms. 

 Jodi bent over and pivoted the side mirror outward to check her reflection. Her green eyes were watery from the wind and her long dark hair was blown into a feathery halo around her face. Her skin was pink from the sting of the cold air. She was still beautiful, exceedingly so, but she could only see what was lacking in herself. Her lively ripeness of early womanhood was gone; that certain something you couldn't even define as being a quality of the eyes or the mouth or the skin. Whatever it was, it had vanished. Now she was merely "pretty" and pretty didn't pay the bills. 

 "Hey, what the hell you doin' to my car?" said an old voice behind her. 

 Startled, Jodi wheeled around to find an aged but healthy looking man standing behind her holding a metal detector, a shovel and a bucket. His face was clenched into a scowl. 

 "Sorry, I was just checking my reflection." 

 "For who?" he said sarcastically. "There's no one here." 

 "I... Just out of habit I guess." 

 "Well, Jiminy frickin' Christmas, you got my mirror all outta whack! I had it just the way I wanted it!" 

 The old man's irritation surprised her. She was used to having men fall over themselves to accommodate her - the straight ones anyway. They'd shower her with complements and gifts and look deeply into her eyes to tell her everything she said was fascinating and profound. But then they'd try to possess her; wall her off from the other men who wanted her; guard her like a toy or a prize. They'd call you a queen with one breath and a whore on the next if they didn't get their way. Was it any wonder she had long ago lost her appetite for romance? In a way it was refreshing that the old guy wasn't trying to flirt with her or make nice. It felt honest. It felt real. 

 "Don't freak out Mister, I didn't break it." 

 "Not yet you didn't. Just leave it alone. And don't tell me not to 'freak out'!" 

 "OK, whatever." She said taking a step back. 

 "You couldn't go a hundred yards without checking how young and pretty you are, could you?" he rasped at her. "Well let me tell you missy, you're gonna be like this one day too," he said sticking his face forward to display his wizen, wrinkled skin with its big pores and liver spots. "And you're gonna look back at this moment and feel like a stupid little ninny!" 

 Something about the phrase "little ninny" tickled Jodi. Perhaps it was the full-on old-fashionedness of it; perhaps it was the fact that at five-nine, she was actually a couple of inches taller than him; hardly "little". Whatever it was, an amused smile crept onto her face. 

 "Bah. I'm wasting my time. Get back to your life," he said with a dismissive wave of his hand as he turned towards his car. 

 The "get back to your life" stung more than it should have. She didn't have much of a life to get back to. Fortunately he had turned away before he could see her smile fall and tears well up in her eyes. She walked rapidly across the asphalt to the road while silently cursing herself for letting the rude old bastard get to her. 

 "Hey, are you OK?" said a male voice as she got to the exit to the road. She looked to her left to see a handsome-ish guy in a New York Jets windbreaker striding up to her. A large, unleashed, black dog trotted at his side. 

 "I'm fine," she said as she continued walking. 

 "Do you want me to talk to that guy? He shouldn't act like a..." 

 "I'm Fine," spat Jodi. The last thing she needed was for some local douche-bag to start a fight with an old man in a parking lot in some lame attempt to get into her panties. 

 "Just trying to help, bitch," he said to her back as she walked away. 

 She walked across the island to the other side. It wasn't far. The little resort town of Blaire Island was a couple of miles long but only a few blocks wide; merely a low ridge of sand between the ocean and a wide, marshy lagoon. She walked through the seedy part of town, where small, run-down houses were rented by the week to young families and groups of college kids. At this time of year it was like a ghost town, with sand in the streets and desperate looking weeds shouldering their way through cracked sidewalks. She walked as quickly as she could through the empty streets. 

 She was glad to get to the marina on the lagoon side of the island where there a few cars and scores of boats. There was a club with a decent bar at the marina where she considered stopping to get a drink and warm up a bit, but she decided against it. She didn't want to spend her afternoon getting hit on by some daytime drunk. 

 Ambling by the marina, Jodi passed a series of long docks blocked by chain link gates, empty boat ramps, marine supply warehouses and other associated businesses. It was when she was passing a boat repair shop with a garage door opened to the street when she spotted something familiar within. It was herself, mocking her with her own youth and beauty from years past as she stared seductively from a poster tacked to the wall. 

 It was a promotional poster for Evinrude that she'd posed for nearly ten years ago. In it she was wearing a tight, yellow wet suit; sleeveless, legless and unzipped down the front so her firm abdomen and the inner slopes of her breasts were on display. Her skin was oiled so the mist they'd sprayed her with beaded deliciously on her tanned flesh. Her muscles stood out in clear definition as she grasped the heavy chain holding the large outboard motor she pretended to be hoisting with a pulley. Locks of her hair drooped temptingly to partially obscure her sultry eyes and her lips were parted ever so slightly to show her teeth clenched as if she was barely fighting back a libido inflamed by the proximity of such a high powered outboard motor. The only sour note was that someone had drawn a curly mustache on her face and written "fuck my pussy" in a word balloon next to her head. 

 She was drawn to her own image as if it were a mirror that reflected back through time. She stepped into the garage to look closer at the poster. God she had been hot. Hot enough to be an A-list model. Why hadn't it happened? Why had she never made it to the super-stratosphere that girls like Klum, Crawford and Brinkley had attained? What had she been missing? 

 "You need somethin' Miss?" asked a voice behind her. 

 She turned around to see a big guy with short brown hair, wide shoulders, thick, hairy arms and shockingly blue eyes. He was wearing a greasy grayish- blue coverall and holding a rag that was almost as filthy as his hands. 

 "Oh. I'm sorry I was... um, just looking around." 

 "We don't like to let people in the workshop. It's dangerous." 

 She looked around at the assortment of heavy equipment, power tools, hanging chains, hydraulic hoists and a smallish dry-dock fronted by an interior quay currently closed off with a big overhead door. He was right. It looked like it could be a dangerous place. 

 "I'm sorry, I was just looking around." 

 "Yeah, that's what you said." 

 She realized she was waiting for him to recognize her. She was standing right next to the poster for Pete's sake. Surely she didn't look that different from ten years ago. So she dithered, waiting for him to make the connection. 

 "There's just so much interesting stuff in here," she said and walked over to a partially disassembled outboard motor. She put her hands on it and looked back at him. Maybe the juxtaposition would spark something in his tiny grease-monkey brain. 

 "Don't touch that please," was all he said. 

 It was really starting to bug her that he didn't make the connection. Hell he'd probably even beat off to that fucking poster. She decided to try another tack. She stepped over to a fat chain suspended from a heavy I-beam and reached up to grasp it. She hung on it and arched her back with her ass sticking out; exactly as in the poster. 

 "What does this make you think of?" she asked. 

 He cracked a half smile. "I think I might be getting the idea. You got any more clues for me?" 

 He was a good looking guy, Jodi admitted to herself. A lot more low-rent than she was used to dallying with, but damn, look at those arms. She decided he was worth another hint. She slowly unbuttoned her sweater, then her blouse; right down to her navel. She was wearing a bra, unlike in the poster, but surely the effect was close enough. She reached up to grasp the chain in both hands and strike the pose again. 

 "How about now?" 

 He didn't say anything. He stepped close, very close, and stared down into her face. Damn, he was tall; six five - maybe six and a half feet tall. She got a sudden feeling of what-the-hell-am-I-doing as he leered at her and reached up to take her hands. But he didn't take her hands. He clamped her wrists in one of his big paws and wrapped his dirty rag around them. He quickly and fluidly tied a strong nautical knot that bound her to the chain. 

 "Hey, what are you doing?" 

 "I got your hint. A rich bitch; in town during the off season; wantin' a little action..." 

 "No, that's not it at all you big idiot, let me down." 

 "Right. After you practically begged me to tie you up? You're just into a little domination, right? You want the big, dumb, dirty mechanic to take you and use you rough." 

 "I... I don't..." 

 She found she couldn't answer except to swallow heavily and look up at him through wide eyes. He loomed over her like a palisade of meat with his face right over hers as he spoke. She could smell the grease and sweat on him. He looked so powerful. He smelled so... male. 

 "Tell you what lady; we'll do a little test." 

 He reached down. She could feel his hands take the hem of her skirt and push it up until it was gathered around her hips. His rough fingers slipped up between her legs, making her flesh tremble as they lightly brushed along the skin of her inner thigh. She bit her lip because she knew what he'd find. When his fingers contacted the damp fabric of her panties his face once again cracked into a leering half smile. 

 "Wet panties don't lie", he said. 

 One of his wide, calloused fingers slipped under the cotton and ran lightly along her lips. For a big man he was very delicate. He traced up along one of her outer labia then back down the other. Jodi found herself writhing at his touch. She wished he would touch her deeper. 

 He did. His finger slipped into the crease of her sex. She was very wet now and there was little friction as he teased up and down along her pussy. She positioned her feet wider as she heaved a pant of desire. Grabbing her panties, he yanked them down to her knees. 

 But then he stopped. Jodi huffed in frustration as he turned away to walk over to the garage door up front. Her body trilled with expectation and a little fear as he reached up and yanked it close with an echoing clatter. 

 "What are you going to do to me?" 

 "I'm going to give you everything you want... Including a few things you don't even know you want." 

 "Like what?" 

 "To begin with I'm going to teach you to enjoy yourself while shutting the fuck up," he said as he shoved a handkerchief into her mouth. She gagged a bit as he pushed it back a little too far. 

 "Now," he said slowly as he reached for her blouse. "Let's see what you got in here." He grabbed the fabric and yanked it fully open, sending the last two still-fastened buttons sailing off to plink against some metal surfaces somewhere. 

 Bastard! This is an expensive shirt and those buttons are hard to replace. She thought even as his brutish carelessness provoked her skin to erupt in goose- bumps. 

 "Hmm, not bad Miss, not bad at all," he said as he took her waist in his hands to turn her body this way and that; inspecting her like a piece of meat. 

 He moved his hands up her body. God they were rough, course like sandpaper as they slid along her flanks. He squeezed her lower ribs firmly and she wheezed into her gag as he forced the wind from her. Then he was sliding his wide palms over her full breasts. He gave them a gentle squeeze, then a not so gentle squeeze. Jodi trembled at his touch. 

 "This is gonna have to go," he said plucking at her bra. The clasp was right there in the front but he reached down with one hand to fish a folding knife from his pocket. With a flick he clicked it open and brought it to her chest. Jodi felt the cool metal slide along her skin as he slipped the flat of the blade under the right strap and cut it loose, then under the left strap and cut it loose. Her tits pushed the cups of her brassiere down as they bounced free into the cold, metallic air of the workshop. He pushed the useless fragment of the bra down around her waist and took her nipples between his thumb and index fingers. He squeezed them hard causing her to squirm like an eel between her bound wrists and her pinched nipples. 

 He smiled. "Like that, do you?" 

 She tried to glare at him with a look of defiance, but she couldn't muster it. She was growing wetter by the minute as his big filthy hands left smudged, greasy fingerprints all over her chest. What the hell is wrong with me? She thought. 

 He reached behind her head and grabbed a fistful of hair. He pulled back, exposing her neck to him and forcing her tits to lift higher up her chest. His face, rough with scratchy bristles, began gliding along her throat, biting her with firm, mildly painful nips as his other hand slid down her abdomen, up under her skirt and along her pussy. 

 "Unnnnng" she groaned involuntarily. 

 A finger slipped up inside her as his thumb began circling her clit. She began moving her hips, pushing herself down onto his fat digit while trying to position her nub where he would hit it just right on each swirl of his thumb. His face was moving down her upper ribs now, stopping to chew along her collarbone before dipping down to bathe her full breasts with his tongue and grind one nipple, then the other firmly between his teeth. She pulled her legs as wide as she could against the stubborn panties that still constrained her at the knees. Finally she heard a tear and they gave way. She threw a calf around his body; drawing him to her, urging him on as she felt her body begin to hum with escalating throbs of pleasure. 

 "What the fuck, Billy?" said a man's voice from somewhere beyond their intertwined bodies. 

 Her tormentor, 'Billy' apparently, turned his face away from her chest and pulled his fingers from her pussy. Her frustration at the curtailment of her gathering climax was overpowered by her terror at the knowledge that another man had entered the workshop. She strained her eyes to see, but her head was still pulled back by the brute's strong hand. Her vision was limited to her wrists bound to the heavy chain above her with the steel truss and corrugated aluminum ceiling beyond. 

 "Hi Wally, hi Angelo," said Billy. He brushed Jodi's leg away from where it encircled his waist and released her hair as he stood up from his crouch. 

 Jodi snapped her head up and looked at the new arrivals with worried eyes. One was obviously Billy's brother, perhaps even his twin. He was just as large, just as meaty, but with long hair that he wore lank and greasy. His startlingly blue eyes inspected her with unconcealed lust as he absently stroked his mustache. The other man was older, shorter and less muscular than the brothers. His skin was craggy, pock-marked, and dusky. His nose was crooked and turned up like a pig's. His dark eyes were small and close together and his dark hair had receded to the back of his skull, leaving mere wisps along his scalp in their wake. 

 "We brought you your calzone Bill, but looks like you've already started eatin'," said the dark, ugly man. 

 "Where'd she come from Billy?" demanded Billy's brother. 

 "She came in and was looking at the Evinrude poster, then she started messing with the outboard over there and hangin' on the chain asking if I could take a hint. So... we, um... we got started." 

 Billy's brother's mouth dropped open. "You're shittin' me." 

 "Naw. For real." 

 The dark ugly man stepped up close to Jodi, all the while looking her straight in the eye; not ogling her body at all. For some reason this made her feel even more exposed than Billy and his brother's blatant inspection of her exposed pussy. Finally the dark man's face split into a big, knowing grin. 

 "Jesus Christ Billy, you're the dumbest motherfucker I know." 

 "What?" 

 "She wasn't asking you to tie her up and molest her; she was trying to get recognized." 

 "Why, who is she?" asked the brother. 

 "Wally, you're just as dumb as your brother." 

 "Just fuckin' tell us Angelo." 

 "I'll show you," he said and walked behind Jodi to rummage around for something on a work bench. As he did so Wally walked up to stand at Billy's side and gaze down at her body as they towered above her. She felt her skin prickle with the unwavering focus of their gaze. She realized with a sense of shock that her pussy was still wet and getting wetter. 

 Angelo stepped back in front of her. He held up a black marker and uncapped the felt. The smell of the solvent wafted up Jodi's nostrils as he brought the tip under her nose. She pulled back but he grabbed a handful of hair and held her head steady as he drew a black, curly tipped mustache over her upper lip. As he did so the strong smell of the marker made her feel woozy. 

 "You like the smell, eh, bitch?" asked Angelo into her ear as her eyes began watering from the vapor. 

 "Hey, she looks like the girl in the Evinrude poster!" said Billy.  

 

 ****** After Ripeness Fades ****** byfastandsloppyÂ© "This is the girl in the Evinrude poster, moron," said Angelo. 

 "You sure?" said Wally. 

 "Hey, lady. You the pretty girl in the poster over there?" asked Angelo. 

 Jodi nodded her head slowly. The vapor from the ink still drying on her lip was making her feel high and spacey. 

 Angelo grinned at her. He uncapped the marker again and held it under her nose. She was breathing heavy in fear and arousal so the fumes were soon coursing through her brain, making her limbs feel rubbery and her mind thick and slow. 

 "But you liked what big dumb Billy was doin' to you, didn't you?" 

 Jodi realized her head was nodding. Her vision was getting blurry and her legs weak. 

 "I bet you'd like more huh?" said Angelo's voice. It sounded far away, although she could feel his warm breath washing across her cheek as he spoke. 

 Jodi was still nodding. It was like she didn't even control her own body anymore. 

 "I bet you'd like all of us, eh? All of us at once?" 

 Jodi continued nodding. Her slushy mind was stunned by the novelty of men trying to get into her panties not by kissing her ass, being clever or making a huge show of their wealth and success, but rather by just taking what they wanted from her. They were like barbarians; sub-humans even. These men weren't playing games; not the usual games anyway. 

 She was still nodding absently when they released her from the chain. Six hands grabbed her and pulled her clothes off, tossing her blouse and sweater onto the workbench, slipping her skirt off and cutting away her now useless bra. Billy dug into her mouth with his dirty fingers and pulled out his slobbery handkerchief. Naked but for her boots Jodi sagged to her knees. As she felt her mind returning from the solvent induced daze they were pushing her forehead to the gritty, greasy floor and tying her arms behind her back at the elbow and wrists. Thus bound, she was allowed to bring her face up again. She looked up at her three captors with wide, anxious eyes. 

 "Do you submit to being our slave?" barked Angelo. 

 Confused and shocked, Jodi didn't answer. Angelo brought forward a leather belt he had been holding behind him and let it dangle before her face. He stepped around her and with a whoosh and a loud slap the strap struck her across the ass. Jodi gasped involuntarily 

 "Do you submit?!" he shouted. 

 "Yes! Yes I submit!" she said. 

 But he slapped her with the belt again. "'I submit', who?" 

 "...?" 

 He slapped her again. "I. Submit. WHO?" 

 "I submit... Master." She gasped. 

 He slapped her again, very hard this time. "Master? How many of us are there?" 

 "I submit, Masters!" she cried. 

 "Christ Angelo, can we fuck her yet?" asked Wally impatiently. 

 "Chill out, Wallace. I want this horny bitch to tell me all of the nasty things she wants us to do to her," said Angelo as he walked back around to stand between Wally and Billy and throw his arms up around their massive shoulders. Jodi looked up but she could only see them indistinctly through her kinky hair that now hung down over her face. Angelo smiled as he asked, "So bitch, what kinda nasty shit do you want us to do to you?" 

 Jodi's shoulders were already sore from her tightly bound arms and her knees ached from pressing against the hard concrete floor. She was tempted to scream at them; yell, "Let me go" and try to escape. It scared her when she wondered if they would allow her to leave. But what really terrified her was when she realized she didn't want to go. She was actually turned on by this sick situation, by these crass oafs, by her own humiliation. How could this be? 

 Angelo swung the belt, smacking it across her face. She tasted a faint trace of blood. Angelo barked again, "I asked you a question slave." 

 "I... I want you to fuck me." 

 "Just me?" 

 "All of you. I meant all of you... Masters." 

 "How? 

 "I want you to fuck my pussy. I want to suck on your cocks. I want you... I want you to come in my mouth." 

 "You're forgetting something, aren't you slave?" 

 "I... want you... to..." She dithered, reluctant. She'd always vowed to never let anyone do that one thing to her. But somehow, just now, in this situation, it seemed... right; enticing even. She finally choked out the words as Angelo was getting ready to swing the belt again. "Fuck my ass. I want you to fuck me in the ass." 

 "You don't sound so sure to me. Beg us." 

 "Please Masters, fuck me. Please fuck my face and my pussy and my ass. Come inside me, come on me. Do anything you want to me. Use me as your fuck toy. Please. Please." 

 Jodi felt tears running down her face. She was so scared and so turned on. It was disorienting. 

 "That's it Angelo, you sick dego. I'm fucking this bitch. I'm sick of waiting for your stupid games," said Wally. He reached up and pulled down the zipper on the front of his coverall. 

 "Yeah, me too," agreed Billy. 

 They both began pulling off their grungy jumpsuits, moving in tandem like stereotypical twins as they shrugged out of their coveralls. Beneath, they wore tee-shirts and dingy white briefs. Jodi felt a sudden spike in her pulse when she saw the long fat bulges straining the fabric of their thread-bare shorts. The brothers pulled off their shirts, revealing muscular chests as hairy and massive as animals. They pushed down their underwear, allowing their big, firm cocks to swing away from their bodies and bob obscenely in her face. Without thinking Jodi's jaw dropped and she formed her mouth into an expectant O. 

 "Yeah, she's ready," they laughed as they stepped in closer. 

 Strong hands grabbed her head. A fat cock pushed past her lips and along her tongue. It was musky, warm and stiff as it rammed further back than she could manage, nudging up against her uvula and attempting to push down her throat. She gasped and gagged as she was cruelly face fucked. After a few dozen strokes the hands holding her skull pushed her away, but it was not a reprieve. Her head was immediately grasped by other strong hands that turned her head to another dick waiting to thrust past her lips and mercilessly pound into her mouth. 

 They took turns at her like polite brothers with a shared toy. But their civility did not extend to Jodi. They used her brutally, ramming her face with force that made her breasts bounce and her throat gargle and wretch. Behind her she could feel Angelo crouching down, his moist breath washing across her back as he slid his grease charged fingers up and down along the crease of her ass. The sensation was uncomfortable yet compelling as he slipped a finger, then two and more up inside her. 

 Tightly bound and impaled in the mouth and ass she found she could not squirm; only accept Angelo's intrusion as he worked her orifice open in preparation for her inevitable anal initiation. She realized she was now looking towards it with impatience rather than reluctance, but she had gone too far now to be shocked by her own blossoming depravity. 

 Suddenly they decided she was ready. They backed off and easily lifted her to her feet. But her aching knees weren't ready and her bound arms made it hard to balance. When they released her, her legs buckled slightly and she tottered sideways in an out of control stumble that only ended when she tripped over a bucket of used motor oil. She landed heavily on her side with a grunt as the bucket fell over and sloshed a flood of greasy black filth onto her bare, helpless body. She struggled to get up from the slick puddle, but was only able to side this way and that, getting herself even oilier and grimier as the men laughed at her from halfway across the shop. 

 As she lay belly down in the slick of old oil Jodi felt her face flush in embarrassment at her clumsiness and her now-filthy body. She wasn't used to being the object of derision. She'd always considered herself better than the vast rabble of humanity; a work of art in human form; a gift from God. But when Angelo stepped over to grab her ankle and pull her along the floor back towards the still laughing brothers it was like he yanked her from her old delusions forever. She was now merely another beast on this uncaring earth, an object of amusement both pathetic and disposable. 

 She looked back and saw the long greasy black streak where she'd slid across the concrete on her belly. "Take me Masters!" she croaked in a cry of soul-deep surrender and unbridled desire. 

 Angelo grabbed her hips, pulled her bottom up and forced her legs wide. His cock was sliding down along the crack of her ass and she sucked in her breath in trepidation. His head was pressing down, pushing at her long maintained taboo as he slapped her loudly across her upturned cheeks and laughed at her simpering. She sobbed as she willed herself to relax and accept the inevitable. With a firm push she felt him force past her reluctant pucker and into her body. 

 He was too quick in his invasion. She felt a tearing, searing sting deep within as he buried himself to the base of his prick inside her hot, tender tissues. She welcomed the pain: basked in it. She felt the animal thrill of being alive, of living life like a beast always one unfortunate turn from extinction. It was like nothing she'd ever experienced before. All those long dreary days on photo shoots or waiting for gigs; days in studios and nights in hotels and condos; prattling on in inconsequential small talk while sipping wine or snorting coke; it was nothing but a shadow play of a real life. On the concrete floor, covered in oil with a cock in her ass and two waiting on standby, Jodi finally felt the thrill in the pulse of her own heartbeat. 

 "Fuck," she growled, wild with feral lust. 

 "Yeah bitch, I'm tearin' you up," crowed Angelo as he slapped her across her ass again. 

 "Flip her over dude, give us a chance." 

 But he didn't. Angelo only reached down and grabbed the back of her head, pushing her forehead into the floor. He shifted his weight forward and, balanced on her skull, he began sliding his shaft straight up and down into her dirty channel. Jodi felt her body quake with an unexpected creeping elation built on suffering and shame that burned like a slow fuse. She felt the crackling embers of pleasure propagating out and singeing her psyche with the hot pulsing friction of his flesh thrusting into hers. 

 I'm going to come, she thought. Holy fucking shit, I'm actually going to come from getting fucked in the ass. 

 But at that instant other words intruded into her consciousness. Billy or Wally - she couldn't tell, they sounded identical to her - finally lost his patience. 

 "Quit hogging the fuckin' girl, Angelo!" 

 "Fuck you, I'm breaking her in." 

 "She'll be useless the way you're going, get the fuck off!" 

 There was a dull wet thump, like the sound of meat hitting meat. Angelo's weight on the back of her head released briefly then dropped back down, causing Jodi's forehead to bang against the floor. Jittery points of light were swimming behind her closed eyes when she noticed Angelo had stopped moving inside her. 

 "Ow, you stupid hick. Don't forget this is my fuckin' shop." 

 "So the fuck what? Me and Billy do all your fucking work." 

 "Yeah, and besides I'm the one who caught the slut, remember? " 

 "Listen idiots; don't think I won't fire your stupid..." 

 There was sudden flurry of more of the dull meat on meat sound. Jodi felt Angelo shudder and suddenly lift away with a wet pop as his dick sprang from her ass. She heard the slap of flesh on the floor, thuds and groans and curses. But she didn't try to look. 

 Those animals are fighting over me, she thought with a wild thrill. Whoever wins... wins me! 

 The unseen battle was short. Soon the big, ugly room fell quiet but for the labored breaths of the men. "Why'd you have'ta be such a asshole Angelo?" said Wally or Billy. Angelo didn't answer. 

 The brother's big hands were on her soon, lifting her off the floor and setting her on her feet. Billy walked over to his discarded clothes to retrieve his knife again. As he walked back he flicked it open. Jodi threw her head back, exposing her throat, instinctually displaying her full submission. But Billy only moved around her to cut the ropes that bound her arms. 

 "Thanks, guys," said Jodi as she rubbed her aching shoulders. 

 Wally reached up. His big paw clamped around her neck as he looked down at her and smiled without mirth. "Don't thank us yet slut. We haven't even got started on you yet." 

 The power of his muscle, the size of his body and the implied threat of further pain and degradation made Jodi's legs go weak and heart race as he pushed her backwards across the shop until a horizontal pole pressed into the back of her neck. She reached up and laid her arms along the length of the cold metal and let her head fall back in surrender. Wally's hand released her neck as he and his brother began pulling her arms straight and lashing them to the pole. She looked left and right as they completely wrapped her arms from wrists to shoulders in wide, strong nylon straps that restricted any possibility of movement. When Billy hit a switch on the wall and the bar began to rise she felt her feet lift a few inches off the ground. The brothers paused in front of her to inspect their helpless prisoner. 

 "That's a pretty sight, ain't it." 

 "It's a work of fuckin' art." 

 "I bet we could improve it." 

 "Yeah, me too. Let's do her legs." 

 Jodi had a throatful of questions on what they intended to do to her, but, not wanting to be gagged again, she merely bit her lip and chewed her tongue in anticipation as they got to work. With more of the thick nylon straps Billy and Wally began to wrap her legs as they had done with her arms. From just above her knees down to her ankles they bound her as before, using the ends of the straps to pull her legs wide, almost into a split as they secured them to the frame of the hoist on which she was suspended. She was left spread eagled in the air, unable to move except to pivot her waist and hips back and forth by the smallest degree. The brothers backed away to once again admire their work. 

 "Hey Angelo, can you see this?" asked Wally. 

 "Fugg mou," said Angelo thickly through a shattered mouth from somewhere out of sight. 

 "Suit yourself asshole," laughed Billy. 

 "Jesus fucking Christ, ain't that the prettiest pussy you've ever seen." 

 Wally walked up to her, not looking her in the eye, only at her skin, her body, her tits, her pussy. He ran a calloused hand down her quivering abdomen and over her tiny strip of short pubic hair before reaching under her to lightly stroke her lips. Jodi sighed lividly at his touch. She ached to thrust her hips to meet his caress or bear down on his fingers with the desperate pressure of her yearning body. The frustration was too much. 

 "Please... fuck me. Fuck me hard. Come on boys...please." she gasped. 

 "We gonna fuck her now?" asked Billy. 

 "Fuck yeah. What side d'ya want?" 

 "I'll take her butt." 

 "Cool. Come on bro, let's suit up." 

 "Oh God yes... Use any hole. Do anything to me..." 

 Billy trotted out of Jodi's field of vision and returned with two slim packages, one of which he handed to Wally. 

 "I'm clean," panted Jodi. 

 "What?" 

 "I had a blood test a week ago. I'm clean. You won't catch anything from me." 

 "How do you know you won't catch anything from us?" 

 "If you're using rubbers now, I bet you always do, right? But you don't have to with me. I'm clean. I'm really not promiscuous, not like some of the other..." 

 Wally grabbed her throat again. Jodi gasped in surprise. 

 "Don't pretend you're a good girl. We seen you in that poster," he nodded across the shop towards the Evinrude poster that had lured her into this greasy dungeon. 

 "Yes master," she choked out with a sob. 

 "Come on dude. Let's do her bareback," said Billy eagerly. "She's into it." 

 "Fuck yeah. You want us to fill you with our jizz, huh slut?" 

 "Yes masters. Thank you." 

 "You ready for both our cocks? We're gonna pry you apart, bitch." 

 "Yes masters. Please masters." 

 Despite her eager agreement to their pledge to "pry her apart", despite her begging, despite her pounding heart and soaking wet pussy, Jodi was terrified. Her breaths came in short, shallow pants as they moved around her and closed in. She had never had two men inside her before, much less two gargantuan monsters like Wally and Billy. Could her body even handle such an extreme trial? It hardly mattered at this point: they weren't going to stop and she wasn't going to stop them. 

 As they sandwiched her between them she disappeared in a compacting chasm of powerful flesh. Their hands moved down between their bodies to line up their hot, hard shafts with her wet and gaping orifices. As they began to force their way into her helpless body she groaned a terrified exhalation of sublime arousal. She could feel her body strain to accept their thick unyielding shafts as they entered her together. 

 "Ooohhunnnggh," she shrieked as she felt her body warp to the pressure of the two cocks thrusting inside her abdomen. She threw her head back as the pain flooded her body. She had thought for sure she'd be crippled, but she discovered the amazing limits of abuse her animal body was able to accept. 

 The bothers fucked her with an unerring synchronization as they flooded her with flesh and pushed against each other through her tortured guts. Their massive chests crushed her between them with each thrust, forcing the air from her lungs as she experienced the sensation of drowning in hot, pulsating maleness. She could see nothing beyond the standing plain of sweat and hair that was Wally's chest. She could hear nothing but the brothers' ragged breaths and her own throaty screams and grunts. She could feel nothing beyond the churning waves of delight and devastation prying at her pelvis. She could smell and taste nothing but the tang of her own terror and arousal mixed with the earthy stench of her meaty prison. 

 Her body tingled with inner fire as it starved for oxygen in the crushing tempest of primal flesh. Her screams gave way to groans as they punished her with their lust. The pain in her pelvis became a quickly burning bonfire of ecstasy as her body began to crackle with the gathering explosion of her onrushing orgasm. The overdose of sensation fed the fuel that rapidly burst into a firestorm of arousal; consuming her in a shuddering, wailing orgasm that seemed to scare the brothers at first, but in the end only encouraged them to redouble their attack. 

 The first orgasm was the difficult one. The next came much more quickly as they worked her body more rapidly in the rush to their own satisfaction. The third came even faster still, triggered when the two brothers shuddered to a grinding halt and squeezed her between their rigid, trembling bodies as their cocks began to erupt in tandem. She tripped easily over into blinding, breathless climax at the sensation of their two huge shafts pulsing, pumping and throbbing inside her as they filled her with hot floods of wriggling, squirming sperm. 

 They rested against her as they let their cocks shrink inside her and she huffed their odor like a junkie attempting to prolong a fix. But finally they stepped back and Jodi was left hanging alone. She could feel their cum dripping out of her and saw that Wally and Billy were smeared with grease rubbed from her body. She was filthy; as dirty as a girl could be. And she loved it. 

 The brothers began the anticlimactic process of unwrapping her limps and easing her down. She was too physically devastated to stand, so she sank to the floor. Looking down she saw the pearly puddle of jism that had accumulated beneath where she had hung. She looked up at Billy, then at Wally. Without a word she brought her face down to lap the spent sperm from the shop floor.  

 

 ****** After Ripeness Fades ****** byfastandsloppyÂ© "Gaw, whud a slub," said Angelo's voice from above her. 

 She raised her head up to look at him. He was standing behind her. His face was a bloody mush, but his dick was out and it was hard. He reached down and pulled her toward him, leaning her back so her head was under his long, dark cock. He crouched to strike her in the face with his erection before bending down to slap her tits with loud, open palmed swats. Jodi did not cower, but when he opened his left fist to show her the two alligator clips sitting expectantly in his hand, she swallowed heavily and looked at Wally and Billy with nervous eyes. But they merely watched with as much interest as their stupid but beautiful eyes could muster. They had no intention of curbing Angelo now that they'd had their turn with her. 

 "I ain'b done wid you bish," Angelo sneered through his bloody lips. "Pud dese on." 

 Reluctantly she picked up the clips and brought them down to her nipples. She squirmed in pain as they bit into the sensitive flesh of her areola. As she struggled to adjust to the new sensation Angleo grabbed a handful of her hair to pull her head back painfully. He stepped over her body to bring his cock to her face. With his free hand he slapped her with his malodorous dick several times before lining it up to push it down into her mouth. He pushed it deep, far back into her throat. She retched but he didn't back off. Jodi struggled to accept it all as he slid it further and further down into her neck until his balls were pressed firmly against her nose. 

 "dake ib all bish!" he hissed from above. Jodi was off balance and struggling to breathe as Angelo stood over her and rammed a merciless throat fuck down into her. As he did so he reached down to twist the clamps on her nipples. She quaked, trembled and raked her fingers down Angelo's legs. She could hear him laugh, but his scorn was like an aphrodisiac. She dug at her clit and flailed her legs across the grimy floor as she rocked with the force of his punishment. 

 Her nipples seared with biting in pain and her lungs were screaming for air when Angelo finally pulled his cock from her throat. Long translucent strands of precum stretched from his shaft back to her gasping mouth as he began quickly stroking his quivering member inches from her upturned face. His breath grew short and ragged as he thrashed himself harder. His muscles tensed and his body shook as he erupted in milky jets of spunk that splashed across her face in hot, sticky flows that dripped from her face and neck and speckled her body. He shoved his cock back between her lips to empty the rest of his load into her mouth in long shuddering pulses. As he stepped back she swallowed the slimy, salty pool washing across the back of her tongue. 

 The group seemed dazed and lost in a sense of unreality as Jodi and Angelo panted heavily in the sex infused air. Finally Jodi bowed her head to the three naked men standing around where she sat sprawled on the floor. "Thank you Masters," she said through a mouth still thick and sticky with semen. 

 "Fuckin'-A, thank you Miss," said Billy. 

 "Yeah, holy shit," said Wally. "That was awesome." 

 "You truwy aw a fweaky bish," said Angelo through his swollen and blood encrusted lips. 

 Billy and Wally helped her up, removed the clamps from her tender nipples and walked her to the bathroom to clean up as Angelo rummaged around in the refrigerator for enough ice to make a compress for his face. When Jodi got to the bathroom she nearly recoiled at the sight of herself. Smears of oil, grease, sweat and sperm covered her skin and clung to her hair. Her forehead was blooming in a livid bruise, as was her neck and several places on her arms. Worst of all was the curly mustache drawn in permanent marker that Angelo had put on her lip. It was as plain as day. 

 She laughed at the ridiculousness of her face. Those guys had fucked her senseless all afternoon with her skin a greasy mess and with that stupid thing drawn on her lip. Oddly the idea gave her a sense of relief; maybe not looking 'perfect' wasn't such a bad thing; maybe it's possible to be desirable even after ripeness fades. 

 "You OK" asked a voice through the door, either Wally's or Billy's. 

 "Yeah, I was just laughing at my mustache," she said to the closed door. 

 "Oh. Sorry about that. Angelo can be a real prick." 

 "Don't worry about it," she said. She wondered how you got something like this off. Surely there was some way to get it off her skin. But then, there were also the bruises. They would take several days to disappear. Why rush things? 

 Taking a deep breath, she opened the door. Billy and Wally were waiting for her. They had that horny look in their eyes again. "Well boys, until I look presentable you're going be stuck with me." 

 The brothers looked at each other, then back to her. 

 "There's a spare room in the back. You can stay in there. It's got a cot." 

 "Come on Billy, she won't want to stay in that shithole." 

 "Look boys," said Jodi. "I'm thinking that maybe I've had things too easy for too long." 

 "Ha! I bet you didn't think we weren't too easy on you back on the hoist," laughed Billy. 

 "Maybe too long though, huh?" added Wally as he nudged Billy. They chortled together at their joke. 

 Jodi ignored them and kept talking. "I was thinking, maybe I need to rough it for a little while. I'm sure that whatever room you have back there will be just awful... but, you know... maybe that's exactly what I need." 

 "Naw, we got everything you need..." began Billy. 

 "Yeah, right here," said Wally, grabbing his crotch and snorting a laugh. 

 Jodi forced herself not to roll her eyes and continued. "What I'm trying to say is, maybe this isn't for me to decide. Maybe I need someone to decide things for me for a while... You boys understand what I'm getting at?" 

 Wally and Billy just stared at her blankly. 

 "Jebus Chries," said Angelo walking from around a corner with a rag full of ice pressed to his face. "You two aw soo fugging stubid." 

 Wally and Billy looked to Angelo and shrugged. He sighed and put down his icepack. 

 "On youb knees slabe!" he barked. 

 "Yes master," said Jodi obediently as she sunk to the floor. 

 "Craw to youw quawdurbs, slabe!" he ordered and pushed her ass with his foot. 

 "Yes master!" she replied as she began to crawl to her quarters. She could feel them leering at her pussy as she crawled away down the filthy hall. She was getting wet again already. She wondered how many more times they'd fuck her before they locked her in her cell for the night...If the room had a lock that is. They could chain her to the cot too, she supposed. Or the floor. Yes... used then chained to the floor all night long... like an animal. That would be so degrading; wonderfully, ecstatically degrading. 

 Her reverie was interrupted as a large heavy hand swooshed down to smack her across the ass with a loud, cupped palm slap followed by deep mocking laughs. She paused and raised her ass to wait for the next slap, but a foot pushed hard against her cheek to urge her on down the hall. 

 It doesn't matter really, she thought. Whatever they decide to do to me will be just fine.
