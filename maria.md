 ****** Maria ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Maria was walking on air with a feeling of elation. After working so very hard for promotion it shouldn't have been a surprise to receive the exulted position, CEO of the Eastern Division, but it was. Every time she walked into the large impressive corner office it was impossible not to look out over the city and exclaim, "Wow!" 

 From high school through university an ethic of hard work had permeated her being and this promotion was the culmination of ten years dedication to the corporation. At thirty-two she was the youngest executive with great prospects for the future. 

 The only downside was the work experience week but it was Friday and the brats would be gone by four. It was one pm nearly time for the usual department walk round to pick up on faults that would be hammered out with department heads afterwards. 

 Maria looked up on hearing a light tap at the door. "Enter!" she said loudly. Her voice had to be raised to overcome the mute effect of plush carpeting and fittings. 'Damn what does he want?" She thought, on seeing one of the staff's adolescent brats walk in. 

 All the work experience brats had to be over eighteen for insurance purposes but this pimply youth looked like a young geek. He looked decidedly unsure of him self so what was he doing here? Surely he had been warned not to get in her way. "Speak up young man. What do you want?" she stated. 

 His eyes had wondered absently around the office until the sharp tone brought him back to the report he held in a trembling hand. "There seems to be something wrong with these reports." Peter started to say then faltered. 

 "Let me see," she said. It was an opportunity to bite someone's head off for this week of unwelcome disruption to the smooth running of the office. A quick put down and she would send him on his way. 

 He held them out but she didn't move so he pushed the papers across the large highly polished oak desk. "The account on the first page seems to contain too high a value for the past three years. It's within budget but you can see it hasn't been balanced with receipts. Plus, some of the positive transfers are from the wrong accounts." He said. 

 Maria glanced down the figures seeing he was right. They looked vaguely familiar though. 'Damn, it's my private account,' she realized. "Don't worry about it I'll get my secretary to investigate just to make sure its all in order." 

 "By the way where did you get this report? These figures are confidential," she asked, attempting to turn on the charm. 

 "I programmed the report myself." he started to say. 

 "Very good, I'm impressed. Who else has seen this?" Marian asked. 

 "No one has seen it yet. I thought it better to bring it straight to you seeing as you've been embezzling corporate funds," he said. From the look she gave him he took a step back as though slapped. This was the showdown he had thought about all day. Peter stood defiantly with arms folded to hide the shake in both hands. 

 Maria sat dumbfounded staring at the little computer geek. How dare he accuse her of such a thing! A sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach left her mouth flapping for air with the words dying between them in a stutter of sound. 

 "It is quiet clear what you have been up to. I only came across the figures by accident. I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone else to see them presented so plainly," he said. A little smirk began at the corner of his mouth ready to take over his face. 

 Maria decided to find out how he pried out of the computer this damning information before it ruined her. She looked around the office licking dry lips watching it disappear, elegant object by object. She would be fired with nowhere to go. Mortgaged up to the hilt, the house would have to go, and the company BMW too. 

 At least it was this little twerp of a youth who probably didn't realize the true significance of the discovery. Thinking positive would turn this into an advantage. Pay him off and cover the tracks more carefully. 

 "So no one else knows, it's just between you and I. Good! So what do you want?" She smiled, trying to make it warm and inviting with years of corporate infighting effectively hiding the insincerity. 

 She looked at herself in a mirror hanging behind him and saw how pale she had become. 

 "Everyone says you're an office tyrant. So, I thought I might bring you down a little. Teach you a lesson in humility. You're arrogant enough to think you wouldn't be found out but I have. I might even help you cover up the evidence, if you do as I say." 

 She looked at him in surprise. He seemed to have grown taller; lifted his shoulders up and jutted the chin out, in an attempted stance of defiant authority. She would have to puncture that. 

 "So what do you want me to do, smile at everyone around here who makes a mistake, and let them off without punishment?" she said. The anger in her voice was not going to help so she abruptly stopped talking. Thinking it over she realized a more conciliatory approach was needed. 

 "I'm sorry, it's been a shock. What do you want me to do? I'll co-operate with you as long as you promise not to reveal this to anyone. If you help to hide the evidence I'll reward you, generously." She smiled again, bowing her head slightly attempting to bow to the inevitable. 

 "I want to sit at your desk for a start," he said. 

 She stood at the window watching him run his hands over the polished surface. She smiled to herself. This was going to be easier than she thought. He was obviously intelligent when it came to computers, but with people? She doubted he had the skills or experience to manipulate anyone let alone her. 

 He looked up seeing a silhouette of her body where the sun shone from a large picture window through the light summer dress. 

 She caught the look and stopped herself from moving with just a slight sway of the hips. An inexperienced eighteen year old interested in her body would be an added advantage. A slight shiver of discomfort followed the thought. 

 Tempted to thrust out her chest she demurred on realizing it was more of a sign of power than an offer, especially to a computer geek. It would be better to show some small signs of being defeated rather than reveal the confidence she felt. 

 The silence grew uncomfortable as he eyed her body and she wondered how much was revealed. She made a mental note not to wear this dress again in the office. Certainly none of the employees had dared to look at her like that, though behind her back maybe they did. She was starting to feel disgusted from his open gawky expression. 

 "I'm due at a meeting, overdue in fact. You can sit there and make yourself comfortable until I get back. I'll tell my secretary not to disturb you while I'm gone." She said, while trying hard not to cross both arms over her breasts. They had always been an attraction to men and so it seemed to adolescents too. 

 Before she could move he said. "Undo a few buttons first." 

 "What?" she said. A little startled she wondered if she had heard correctly. 

 "You're the office harridan and need pulling down a little." He said. The guys he worked with all week had called her a bitch but he didn't feel comfortable with that. 

 "A couple of buttons will show off a little cleavage, not too much. You can pretend not to notice but it will dent that stuck up pride a little. Everyone will get an eyeful and you will be the one feeling vulnerable for a change." He said. 

 He was painfully experienced at feeling vulnerable among the in-crowd at college and she was definitely one of 'them'. The guys in the computer room had commented on her figure and he had pretended not to hear their lewd remarks. 

 It would surprise them all to see him now. He wondered how she was going to get out of this, knowing she would eventually. At least she hadn't just thrown him out of the office. He looked at the 'boss bitch' willing her to do it. 

 "No, you can't make me do that!" she stated flatly. 

 "Do you want me to email that report to your boss?" he asked. 

 "Just one button then," she said, and deftly twisted a top button undone. 

 "You agreed to do as I said," he reminded her. "I will have to think of a suitable punishment for your disobedience. Two buttons or I'll have to come up with a double punishment." 

 This was fun! Speaking to a mature adult as they did to him was awesome. There was no shortage of ideas for he had suffered punishments and being talked down to for as long as he could remember. 

 The audacious demand had caught her by surprise otherwise she wouldn't have given him the advantage. By undoing the first button she had given in to the blackmail. With an agitated expression she twitched another button undone. 

 When he pushed the bridge of his glasses back it reminded her of school and those nerdy computer geeks spying on the cheerleader practice sessions. Friends would have pounced on him with derisive put downs at the nerve of him just talking to her let alone making demands. 

 The thought of friends left her feeling lonely and vulnerable. It had been too easy losing contact with everyone she had grown up with. It would have taken time and effort to mature friendships and neither was available after working long hours and putting in so much effort at the office. 

 She stormed out in a huff not daring to look in the mirror. At the door to her office she hesitated. He was right she did feel vulnerable and self conscious. Picking up the stride she determined to brazen it out. It was all the more difficult with fate conspiring against her as for once she was wearing a low cut bra. 

 Bending over a desk here and there asking how things were going, glancing at reports making out they were important, was all a part of the usual routine. Only this time it was difficult to bark at staff as they furtively looked at her ample cleavage. 

 It was embarrassing and distracting. She hadn't got through one department with the men wanting her to look at something, asking questions, getting her to lean over their desks. She could feel the increased tension in the office. They stood in two's and threes obviously discussing her; looking away when she looked up. 

 Why didn't she just walk on or refuse to lean over these unimportant requests for attention? The buzz of excitement running through the office was affecting her too much. 

 She felt as though she were back in college parading around in a little pompom outfit amongst these grown men. Since starting work she had always worn sensible clothes that covered her body, wanting to be taken seriously, not treated like a cheerleader airhead. 

 'Damn!' The attention was exciting and she was enjoying it! The revelation was difficult to accept and difficult to ignore. 

 Looking at her watch meaningfully she announced to her assistant. "I need to prepare for the 'head meeting'. You had better carry on here." Maria marched off, retreating back to the office with breasts bouncing proudly before her. 

 Almost slamming the door she breathed a sigh of relief. Even her secretary gave her a funny look. No one had dared mention the bra was showing. Thinking it was an accident none of them wanted to spoil the fun of seeing the boss's breasts bouncing around the office. 

 She looked directly at him ready to shout, 'You've had your fun now get out!' 

 "Are you ready for your punishment?" Peter asked. He had plenty of time to contemplate something and decided to be dramatic. After all, she had given in once why not again. 

 "Sure why not," she said casually. Best get it over with. Let him show his hand then I can get on with pulling cards from up my sleeve. 

 "Bend over the desk." Peter said. He hid the nervousness well. 

 "What! Just wait a minute young man," she stopped short on seeing a finger meaningfully poised over the keyboard. Of course! He could reply to an email from her boss attaching the report. 'Damn! Why didn't I think of that?' 

 "Hold on. There's no need for that." She could see it now. It was an email from not just the divisional boss but the owner of the whole damn corporation. The bastard was about to reply to an email of congratulations from the top man, Mister Warner. "Let's talk about this. I'll accept a punishment for what I did but let's be reasonable here." 

 He cut her short. "This isn't a punishment for what you did, that will come later. This is for disobeying me." 

 "But I did what you asked. It did have an effect on me. You were right." She added the last statement from habit. Tell a man he's right and he will go along with what you have to say, it usually worked. 

 "Don't press that key, please," she said, while walking round the desk. She meant to bend over the desk to get a closer look at the email. He also had a good look at her cleavage but that suited her, hoping to fluster him. 

 He pressed her unresisting head down onto the desk. Her eyes were so close to the screen she could read the small print found at the foot of all executive emails; 'not responsible for errors', etc. 

 "Lift the back of the dress," he said. There was a nervous tremble to his voice despite trying to sound authoritative like the principal at college. 

 She watched his finger trembling slightly and quickly reacted incase he accidently pressed the send key. 

 'At least I have a decent pair of panties on,' she thought. The incongruity of it all almost spilled out as an inane giggle. This young man was about to spank the bottom of a CEO in her own office. 

 She wondered if it was too late to put a stop to it all right now but the consequences of losing her job would be too much. All those years of hard work lost for ever. 

 Maria felt his eyes on her and the thought of him ogling her rear was distasteful. The last boyfriend had admired her heart shape bottom telling her it was a best feature. She had told him what she thought of such a remark in stinging tones. That had been nine months ago and she hadn't seen him since. 

 It wasn't just that of course. She just didn't have time for a relationship, and had to admit she was a just a bit on the cold side. She just needed a more experienced man to warm her up. She had told him that too. 

 It was so humiliating she wished he would hurry and get it over with. She felt a slap then another, one for each cheek. 'It's ridiculous letting this twerp demean me like this. If my secretary walked in and saw the boss having her bottom spanked by this eighteen year old I'd die of shame.' 

 'No doubt the rest of them out there would enjoy seeing their bitchy boss bent over for a spanking. Yet it's this student who gets to degrade me. A powerful woman with her dress up around her waist, panties on show, it's terrible.' 

 "Lock the door, quick, lock it." She gasped. 

 The phone rang and she was caught between the two demands. 

 "Answer it then," he said. He kept a hand on her back holding her down over the desk. 

 She couldn't see the phone panel to know who was calling but picked it up anyway. If she didn't her secretary would and might barge in to tell her it was important. 

 "Mister Warner, how are you?" She gulped on feeling another slap. It wasn't hurting her bottom just her pride. She tried to shut out was happening back there to concentrate on the important man's speech. 

 "Yes, sir, thank you, Sir. I appreciate your advice." She dare not make a sound and struggling wasn't an option either. She felt her panties being pulled down and almost hung up. Surely he heard the slap on her bare ass? 'Damn the little shit.' She thought. 

 "Oh!" She let out a little yelp. A finger was exploring between her legs. 

 "Are you all right?" he asked. 

 "Yes Sir. I think it's a cold that's all," she lied with a trembling voice. Those damn fingers were becoming more intrusive and there was little she could do about it. The second time he touched her sensitive bud she was more prepared and just squirmed rather than yelped. It was obviously by accident but her reaction was teaching him where to touch. 

 She dropped the phone on to its rest and collapsed upon the desk with a sigh of relief. She tensed again, this time from what he was doing to her rather than from talking with Mister Important while being spanked. 

 She needed desperately to clamp her legs together but couldn't. He was standing between them and in any case she couldn't move. He was doing unspeakable things to her pussy. The idea of him seeing it all was bad enough, but those fingers were working her over only too well. 

 Only yesterday she had a wax job ready for a vacation to Hawaii next week. Her pussy was completely bald and he held her in the palm of his hand. Those fingers were working hard on her and she could hear the squishy noise of her soaking wet lips. He had learnt quickly what buttons to press and was working her like a fiddle, fast and furious. 

 'Damn him, I'm nearly there. This is so fucking humiliating,' she thought while shuddering on an inevitable climax. The phone rang again but she couldn't move, didn't want to break the sensational rhythm. 

 "Answer it then." He said, and stopped playing with her. His hand held her crotch in a firm tantalizing grip. 

 She wanted him to continue and bit her lip instead of letting loose a demand for satisfaction. "Yes?" She croaked into the phone. It was her secretary. "The meeting? I know I'll be out in a minute." The fingers started up again and she groaned turning it into a cough. "I'm OK. Just coming. Coming down with a cold. I'll be ready in a minute." 

 She slammed the phone down. "Quickly, make me cum, please." She said. On the cusp of a long awaited orgasm another interruption almost brought on a loud groan of frustration. 

 Her secretary and assistant were at the door arguing. Any moment he would walk in and catch her with this young man finger fucking her over the desk. "Did you lock the door?" She croaked through dry lips. She knew he hadn't. 

 He still had her crotch in the palm of his hand with fingers working in her pussy with just the right pressure and movement. She was caught in limbo for what seemed such a long time. The voices receded away from the door to merge into the background hum of the office. 

 A finger pressed against her bottom and slipped in. Wet from her juices it easily overcame a tight resistance and squirmed up her asshole. Collapsing upon the desk she bit a clenched fist not daring to scream out. 

 The orgasm hit her full in the belly with muscles clenching tight, legs rigid, toes tingling. The nerves throughout her body were racked hot with fire. Her nipples hardened, her lips swelled to even greater puffiness. 

 Peter held her against the desk by her crotch with one hand. He watched her body trembling guessing right she had an orgasm. He reveled in the power he had over her completely unaware he had finger fucked her into the most powerful orgasm of her life. 

 Maria had been too busy for too long for a relationship and would have probably cum with little effort. That it had been this young stranger playing with her was mortifying. She was too distraught to think about how much the humiliation had played a part in her downfall. 

 "You had better get along to that meeting. You don't want to keep everyone waiting." Peter told her. 

 There was still a look of awe on his face but she didn't notice. She dare not look at him as she straightened the dress pulling it defensively over her body. She looked at his hand holding her panties, still unable to look him in the eye. 

 "I'll keep these. A souvenir," he told her. He patted her ass and watched her scurry out of the office.  

 

 ****** Maria Ch. 02 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Chapter 02: A bad weekend at home 

 With every squirming movement in the meeting room chair Maria was reminded of her bare bottom and how sore it was. She had been given a spanking in her executive office by a student and he added to the humiliation by keeping her panties as a souvenir. 

 If she hadn't been so shocked from the audacious act Maria would have tried to wrestle back some authority or at least demanded her panties back. Instead she scampered away without them, running late, to this departmental meeting. 

 The department managers gave their usual reports but she couldn't concentrate on what they said. All she could think about was how that young man had produced a damning report showing how she was siphoning off company funds. It started as just a game to prove how clever she was. It wasn't a large amount but theft was theft. It was enough to have her fired and face the dire prospect of prosecution. 

 "Thanks Bill, a thorough report as usual. I'm sure everyone will need time to digest the facts so, Monday morning sharp, emails with comments everyone," she commented tartly. "Any more urgent business," Maria said, emphasizing the word urgent, effectively winding up the meeting. 

 The sigh of relief by everyone else was missed by Maria who wanted to get back to her office. Bill was about to point out he hadn't completed the report but a kick under the table brought him round to the fact it was Friday and everyone wanted to get home. 

 With smiles all round they realized the office harridan wasn't going to keep them working late. The smiles turned to astonishment on seeing their boss scuttling off to her office without a scolding remark to anyone, without even a glare at the underachievers. 

 "I wonder what the tyrant is up to. She didn't even take notes," Bill commented with a sigh, while shoving his report into a briefcase. The others were already pushing toward the door, fortunate enough not to hear or they might have dwelt on an uncomfortable thought over the weekend. 

 Maria slowed down toward her office willing him not to be there. "This stupid game of his has got to stop," she said to the empty main office. Pushing the door open wide she stopped dead in the doorway. 

 "You still here?" she boldly stated. 

 "There's unfinished business," he said, right back at her. Peter didn't feel as confident as he sounded but had enough time to contemplate how easily she had capitulated earlier. He was enjoying playing with this office tyrant and wondered how far he could push her. 

 "Everyone's gone and security will be around soon. I'm locking my office, you can't stay here," she briskly stated. She wasn't prepared to call his bluff until there had been time to cover her tracks but had no intention of letting him manipulate her again. 

 The dilemma of wanting rid of him and keeping him from revealing the awful truth was gnawing at her. He had offered to hide the information better than she had so needed to keep him close. She was confident of gaining back the initiative yet was still undecided how to play this game. 

 Gathering a laptop under one arm she maneuvered him toward the door. She began talking to him, keeping him with her on the way to the elevator. 

 "You're a smart lad. There's always a job here for someone with exceptional ability with computers." She listened carefully letting him know she was taking an interest with an appropriate question along the way. 

 While trying to find out what he wanted she steered the conversation along as well as purposefully steering him out of the building. 

 In the underground parking lot she handed him the lap top to fish for keys in a black designer bag. It had been purchased from purloined company funds and it was usually swung around like a trophy. 

 He smiled at her, still holding the lap top. Maria realized he held the means to get back into the main company computer as well as having access to all her contacts, including the high and mighty bosses. 

 "You were away long enough for me to get those email addresses off your desktop," he said, with a self satisfied smile. "I could of course bury the fraud," he said. 

 Not liking the confident smile and wanting to get him away from the office she told him to get in. 

 "Wait! Remove the skirt first," he quietly told her. 

 Opening her mouth to berate him she hesitated when he turned around and strode off with the laptop. Security cameras were all over the place though where she was standing no one would ever know. She slipped the skirt off, flung it on the seat and slid in on top of it. In haste Maria caught up with him. The urge to run him down was strong but pulled alongside instead. 

 The window slid down silently, with the Mercedes engine quietly purring in the background echoing off concrete walls. "As you said, we have unfinished business," she stated, almost spitting the words at him. 

 He looked down at her with a look of pleasure on his face. It was more than just a victory smile and it sent a shiver down her spine. 

 He walked around to the passenger side and climbed in. Clicking in the seat belt he didn't even glance at her bare thighs. She kept them pressed tightly together from intense embarrassment at being naked from the waist down. 

 "You could at least give me my panties back," she shot at him. The slight edge of a pleading tone in her voice surprised her. 'Hell! How low will I sink to save my job?' The thought was cut off as suddenly as it had arisen. It was too frightening to dwell upon. 

 "Just drive," Peter told her. 

 Maria cringed as they came up to the security booth. Whoever was in there could look down into the car and see her bare legs. There was nothing she could do but hope he instead just glanced up to see it was the head of the Eastern Division. 

 Keeping a light foot on the gas was torturous when all she wanted was to crash through the barrier. Keeping her eyes to the front she watched the barrier jerking upward expecting any moment a head to pop out of the box. 

 Seeing Peter in the car would be bad enough but with bare thighs on view tongues would wag. The embarrassment would be bad enough but the dread of loosing authority in the office gave her palpitations. 

 Maria couldn't help taking a sideways glance. A security guard was there but he was studying a clipboard. In the fleeting moment she passed an impression of concentration bore out he had purposely ignored her. Not being popular at least had some advantages. 

 The fuel-gauge was high so a quick dash home was possible without stopping for gas, which was a nightmare of a prospect. Just the thought of pumping gas half naked was humiliating enough to make her nervous. She would have to keep a light foot on the gas for it would be an agony of humiliation being stopped by the police. 

 He had won the first round by keeping her off balance, unable to think straight. Not far now, and at last she was regaining some composure, allowing her to think more clearly. Once on home territory she would work on him, flattering him to get the dreadful mistake buried. 

 On the off-ramp a van pulled up beside them. A guy glanced in and exclaimed something to his friends. They leaned out of the windows shouting, laughing and jeering at her with lewd gestures. The lights changed and the black sleek Mercedes sped off only to be caught by another set on red. 

 They caught up and the instinct to ride the lights, with a dash for the safety of home, nearly won. The thought of them following her home was just as mortifying as their constant requests to open her legs and worse. 

 "Show us your beaver honey, how much do you charge, get those tits out," they recited with excited shouts. 

 The lights changed and she shot up the on-ramp intending to out run them on the freeway then double back. Unluckily the Friday evening traffic was backed up and the Mercedes ground to a halt inches from another car. Hearing them shout abuse from behind she shrank down in the seat grinding her teeth in anger. 

 People started to look at her, just staring, wondering why she was a target. Wondering why those young guys were asking how much she charged. Was she a whore? She must be an expensive whore to be driving a set of wheels like that. Imagination rattled her nerves to pieces. 

 On the hard shoulder a police car rolled up and the guys went quiet. The sudden quietness drew her attention and in the mirror she saw an officer speaking to the driver. When he glanced her way she cringed. 

 "Please Peter! Give me my panties back! I'll do whatever you say, whatever you want, please!" she urgently pleaded. 

 "They're mine, a trophy. I'll loan them to you but you'll give them back when I ask," he said. 

 "Sure, whatever you say just let me cover up before the cops get here," she whispered, as though they might overhear. 

 He leaned over the gear shift and lifted a leg. "Damn! You don't have to put them on," she scolded him. 

 "You just sit there otherwise they'll see you struggling," he warned her. 

 She kicked off the shoes knowing he was right, it would be difficult to maneuver in the driver's seat. She felt his breath on her thighs as he struggled to pull them over a foot. Reaching for the other he had to bury his face in her lap. Torn between pushing him away and needing to cover up was upsetting. 

 In the mirror the officer was looking their way. "Hurry up!" she whispered. In desperation she lifted a leg, parting her thighs. To reach the foot he pushed closer with his head burrowing between her legs. She felt his lips on hers and wanted to scream. 

 It would be better to be caught half-naked rather than be charged with performing a lewd act on the highway. His tongue tasted her and she whimpered. Her eyes were on the cop talking to those brazen young men while her tormentor explored her pussy. 

 She watched the cop saunter toward her. Peters' tongue found her swollen bud and she gasped. She stared out ahead gripping the wheel tight, unable to stand watching her nemesis approaching. The car in front moved and she put her foot down. 

 The Mercedes jerked forward a few feet. The cop hesitated then started forward again. Maria breathed heavily from the physical stimulation and the humiliation of being caught. The arousal was tremendous, overtaking her, swamping her mind, washing away a lifetime of inhibitions. 

 She wanted to be caught, wanted to be humiliated before the crowd of commuters. She imagined being torn from the car to be sprawled on the road, for all to see, aroused like a wild animal. 

 The car in front moved slowly forward and she followed with a foot wobbling the gas as though she were peddling the car. The traffic was thinning and when she looked in the mirror the cop had given up stalking her and was waving the van on. 

 Suddenly the road was clear and she managed to glide down the off ramp. They weren't following! Peter was working on her harder than ever with a skill learnt while on the job. She pressed her thighs on his head momentarily thinking to stop him. She couldn't, didn't want to. She desperately needed an orgasm. 

 "That's it, just there, please don't stop," she cried, when he came up for air. The car found its way home. They pulled into her street and outside her house, before neighbors, an orgasm overcame her. She wailed out an animal sound and squeezed his head between her legs. No-one heard or noticed but it felt as though every neighbor had witnessed the deplorable exhibition. 

 Somehow she managed to flick the garage switch and drove in breaking sharply before hitting the back wall. Maria sat there a moment wondering how this had happened. A young man had led her by the nose through one agonizingly embarrassing moment after another. Yet she had the most deeply satisfying orgasms ever. Not one but two! 

 This would have to stop! The trembling of her legs, as he continued to work on her, made the thought a lie. "Please Peter, enough," she sighed. 

 He peeled the panties off her feet and pushed the shoes back on. She struggled out of the car and led the way into the house only just remembering to switch off the alarm. 

 Peter followed her into the house feeling elated knowing he had this office bully under his control. He hadn't planned on going this far. He simply wanted to show her the damning report with the idea of forcing her to go easy on the staff in the computer room. 

 It was no longer for the guys in the office it was an exciting game just for him. He had a mature woman at his mercy and couldn't resist getting his own back on this adult and bully, representing those who had pushed him around at college. 

 After embarrassing her in the office he just couldn't resist pushing her further. He guessed she had an orgasm in the office and was certain she had again just now. So what could he get her to do next?  

 

 ****** Maria Ch. 03 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© Maria felt so ashamed giving in so completely to a stranger. The blackmail put her into a difficult position and he had out manoeuvred her every time she tried to regain some composure. 

 What made her feel so wretched was having succumbed to two overpowering orgasms from a young inexperienced man. Realising they were in part from the humiliating situations he had contrived, left her feeling bewildered and pathetic. 

 Walking into her home, naked from the waist down, with Peter following didn't help. He could see her bare bottom, still red from his spanking. The very idea of being excited from this vulgar exhibitionism was hard to accept. 

 From the garage they walked through the kitchen into an open planned room decorated with expensive furnishings. A large luxurious sofa acted as a room divider between dining area and lounge. Maria hesitated before walking around it knowing she should get dressed before giving him a talking to. 

 She needed a few moments to bring her thoughts together before launching into a lecture. This was all wrong. She must stop this dire game of his but her thoughts were in a whirl of confusion. 

 What was so difficult was she was beginning to readjusting her self-image from a tough business woman to a weak female dependent on humiliation. This revelation was hard to accept. 

 With a hand lightly resting on the back of the sofa she stared across the room. All this too would be lost if he revealed what he knew to the owner of the corporation. With a great summoning of willpower she pulled her thoughts together. She must use her management skills to wrest back control. 

 She felt him close then a gentle touch. It was like a shock of electricity stunning her. She felt the rough jeans graze her sensitive bare bottom. She dare not turn to confront him as he would see the weakness in her eyes. The words were forming but the throat and lips were dry. A hesitant voice would do no good; she needed to sound authoritative. 

 Peter followed from the garage watching her bare ass gyrating seductively. One cheek scrunched up, then the other, with each step. It was fascinating. Everything that had happened over the past couple of hours had been a first and he wondered what would happen next. 

 When she stopped right in front of him he took the extra step to stand against her. The front of his jeans pressed against a bare ass for his already stiff cock to suddenly ache with an extra hardness. 

 He lowered his hand to touch the beautiful bare bottom, only the hand diverted to his fly. Without thinking what he was doing he instead pulled an aching cock from the jeans. From habit he gripped it, ready to play with himself, as though this were a bedroom fantasy. 

 Maria felt his penis nudge her bottom and in a panic leant away from him. There was nowhere to go but over the back of the sofa. In slow motion she creased forward stopping herself with both hands pressing into the cushions. As she fell it became painfully obvious what was about to happen. 

 "Damn!" she exclaimed, in a soft pitiful voice, almost a sob. She was presenting her private place to this young stranger. Was there no depths to which she would sink to save her career? 

 Peter's hips pushed forward while he watched as though from a distance. His hard cock pressed against her sex. In that moment he felt elated, too worked up to think about what he was doing. 

 "No!" Maria shouted. 

 He lifted her onto her toes or perhaps she had risen in an attempt to escape this ultimate indignity. She tried to push away from him but her hands sunk into the soft cushions of the sofa. She felt his hardness press against the soft open folds of her sex and she wailed pitifully. 

 "No! Not that. Please stop!" Maria wailed. 

 She felt a harness invade her body and moaned in anguish. The young blackmailer had entered her without resistance. There was no fight left in her but the realisation that her body had been so unresisting and so easy to take, so wet and ready for him, it was mortifying. 

 Peter watched the throbbing bulb of his cock push between the lips of her wet pussy. The hairs might have tickled but no sensation other than the grip of that luscious hole could be contemplated. This was the first time and he worked on instinct. 

 There was no thought of holding back or care for her needs. He stared at his cock the only contact between them. Like a rod of iron it poked into her. His thigh and calf muscles tensed in a spasm. With an almighty thrust he shoved his hard cock all the way into that tightly gripping pussy. 

 Gripping her hips he began to piston his whole body back and forth fucking her with all his strength. Without experience youthful exuberance took over for him to slam into her again and again. 

 "No! Please, no!" Maria's plea was sobbed in gasps. Never before had she been so humiliated but despite her protests he was taking her. She tried to escape over the sofa but he had her pinned to it. The unwelcome rod was thrusting into her. She was being fucked. 

 She tried to fight back, to push him away, only the thrust of her naked arse helped him reach into her. Deeply, with strong thrusts he was taking her. She was being fucked by this young man, a stranger, a blackmailer, someone who had teased and humiliated her. 

 On feeling it drive all the way inside, filling her, she moaned a different kind of sound. A guttural anguish in her throat arose from her stomach spluttering from her lips. This young man was fucking her hard and she couldn't say she didn't want it for she needed it after such intense sexual stimulation. 

 Never before had she submitted to a man; she had always remained in control in the bedroom. Now she was letting herself be taken by a stranger, a young man, hardly more than an inexperienced boy. He had spanked her, humiliated her and now he was taking her and she let herself go. 

 Peter didn't think to hold back for her satisfaction. Disjointed thoughts ran through his mind. 'I'm doing it! I'm fucking my dad's boss. I'm fucking the office bully, fuck them all!' 

 He wanted it to last for ever but all too soon he felt an overwhelming desire to bury his dick deep into her and hold it there. "I'm cumin," he exclaimed. The loudness of his voice was nothing compared to the feeling of exaltation. 

 The last guttural sounds were squashed from her body as he pressed her tight into the hard back of the sofa. In a sigh of compressed air her lungs were emptied as he began to fill her. 

 "Yes! Fuck me!" she gushed with heart felt pleasure. Maria had finally relented to pure lust and it heated her veins red hot. She felt his cock twitching inside spurting his seed deep inside. The thought warmed her entire body. 

 She couldn't move with his weight pressing her into the sofa. She felt completely under his control. Her career rested in his hands, he had opened her up to unexpected sexual feelings, and now he had mastered her completely. 

 She wanted to wrap her arms around him, for him to hold her tight. Instead she tried to breath. Small shallow breaths came and went with little gasps of pleasure incoherently uttered. "Oh shit! Yes. Fill me up, I'm all yours, fuck me, make me cum," she whimpered. 

 Her knees rattled against the back of the sofa, her arms shook, with the spasms of an all consuming orgasm. 

 Peter felt elated with a great wave of warmth for her. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled the limp body to him. He wasn't sure what to do next, didn't care, merely wanting to hold her close. 

 Feeling the stickiness between them an idea of washing her came to a befuddled mind. He half carried her upstairs and found the bathroom. He pulled her clothes off and his too, throwing them in a heap. 

 The shower came on with frantic twists and he pulled her under the spray. A bottle of shampoo came to hand and he lathered her body in slippery soap. He explored her body with trembling hands. 

 Over her neck, down her shoulders, over her breasts, he gripped the swollen nipples. He pulled the unresisting slippery body to him wrapping his arms around her, pressing close with both hands tight on her bottom. 

 He nibbled her neck and lips, sucking them into his mouth. Their tongues explored with water dousing them yet it was unable to quench the fire. The flames of passion ignited again, she knew, for she felt him harden. 

 This time he led the naked unresisting woman by the hand to her bedroom. He sat on the edge of the large bed ready to pull her down onto him, only she sank to her knees. 

 Maria had never before consented to perform what she thought of as a lewd act but in her present state wanted more than anything to reward her attentive lover. So many orgasms should have satisfied her, left her sated, but this was for him. Or so she might have thought if she had been thinking straight. 

 She pushed his knees apart to get to his already hardening penis. She bent forward and gave it a gentle full lipped kiss. It tasted of strawberries from the shampoo they had both been drenched in. Hesitantly she opened her mouth and sucked its head into her mouth. 

 Peter watched in awe. The office harridan was on her knees before him sucking on his dick. The sensitive petting was more thrilling than if she had gripped it hard. Little tingling sensations added to the thrill of seeing this mature sophisticated woman submitting herself to him. 

 He could see her full lips begin to suck his dick into her mouth; it trembled and twitched under the careful attention. He wanted more, needed to be engulfed. Instead he fell back and closed his eyes. 

 It seemed so large, how could she take more than that. He fell back onto the bed and his hips bounced up forcing his cock deeper into her mouth. She choked. With determination she sucked hard on it. Unsure what to do she continued to suck on it like a pacifier. 

 In a moment of inspiration she moved her head up and down. Hearing his moans of approval she continued. The initial passion had passed for her to be left with a sense of calm satisfaction, with a feeling of giving herself utterly to him. As though it were pacifying her she felt tranquil. She was his, belonged to him, needing his approval. 

 He thrust up his hips with taught muscular legs pushing his cock deeper into her mouth. He didn't hear her spluttering choke but felt every drop of sperm squirt from the end of his dick. 

 She sat back on her haunches looking down at his feet. He lifted her head looking into her eyes. There was no need to speak. The messages were clear. She fidgeted uncomfortably, knowing she felt gratefully for his approval but feeling that was wrong. 

 He stroked the corner of her lips and pushed a finger into her mouth. She tasted the bitterness of his sperm and felt even more humble. She was an important business woman on her knees feeling so small and helpless. It must be her failing, not his power over her, yet there was nothing she could do to overcome it. 

 "Your body is so beautiful," he whispered. 

 Maria became self-conscious of her nakedness but couldn't lift her arms to cover her body. The pure innocent remark overwhelmed her. He was no longer a nasty blackmailer but a master of her body. He had stimulated her like no other lover, despite his inexperience. 

 She was sure it had been a coincidence that he had pushed her into finding that such despicable behaviour was exciting. It had been there hidden and undiscovered. But what could she do but submit. All the fight had been fucked out of her. 

 He stroked her wet hair and cupped her cheek in the palm of his hand for her to nuzzle against it. She felt wonderful as though she could fly and cure all the worlds' ills. 

 "We had better get dressed," he told her. 

 This was a surprise. She had always made love under the covers in the dark but here she was naked and proud. She watched him open the dressing room, listening to the swish of hangers as he rummaged around. Still squatting on the floor she wondered what he was looking for, what he intended her to wear. 

 This was certainly another new experience. She wondered how deeply she had sunk under his influence to allow this. She smiled at the thought. He brought out a plain cotton slip and let it fall over her breasts then dragged it over her nipples. 

 The teasing made her laugh. They were still sensitive and they tingled, as she did, with excitement. She heard him opening and closing draws in the dressing room until he brought out a pair of white panties. 

 "Come on get dressed," he scolded her. Pulling the lethargic body up, he pulled the slip over her head and stood back in obvious admiration. She bathed in the glow of his pleasure. He lifted one foot at a time and began to pull her panties up her legs. 

 He couldn't resist smoothing them into place between her cheeks, eliciting a pleasant little giggle from her. "Come on, I'm hungry, I need to eat," he admonished her. 

 It seemed she was dressed despite the lack of a bra or even a dress. Fitting a bra was probably beyond him, she thought. It didn't matter for the kitchen wasn't overlooked by neighbours. She was thankful to be wearing panties rather than a thong. 

 He took her hand to lead her downstairs. She felt like a young lover, letting him take her, submitting to his wishes. His youthful exuberance was infectious. "What do you want? To eat I meant," she said, with a playful glint in her eyes. 

 "A burger, two burgers, and an ice cold milk shake," he said. 

 Before she could stop him he opened the kitchen door leading into the garage. "No, I'm not dressed. I'll cook something," she said in alarm. Maria didn't want to be seen like this or with him either. It was one thing to let go of her inhibitions in her own home, but in the reality of outside, it would be painful. 

 She tried to think of what might be in the fridge to convince him to stay. The feeling of submission to her young lover was difficult to overcome. With protests being ignored she found herself in the driving seat while he buckled her up. 

 "I can't go out like this! This is a slip not a dress. It's too short. I need a bra," she complained. It all went unheeded as the garage door slid up. Before she knew what was happening he started the engine and slipped it into reverse for them to back out onto the drive. Not wanting neighbours to see them she drove away. 

 "We can go for a drive-through," she suggested. There was no way she could get out of the car dressed so skimpily. From the big smile on his face she wondered what he had planed for her next. If earlier was anything to go by she was in trouble. 

 The annoying thing was she could feel herself becoming heated just from driving around in a thin slip. It had risen up around her waist but at least she had panties on this time. Her nipples seemed to be imitating Pinocchio's nose. 

 She could just imagine pulling in at a drive-through with the young guys crowding in the pay window, keeping them waiting for a good look at her. The nipples pushed harder at the thin slip ready to burst through and she dare not look down at her panties.  

 

 ****** Maria Ch. 04 ****** byStoryTeller07Â© "Please Peter, lets go home, please," Maria asked plaintively. She felt so vulnerable driving around in just a slip. At least she wore panties but the slip was thin and far too short to be seen in outside. Dominating her thoughts was the idea of how embarrassed she would be if someone familiar saw her. If they spotted her dressed like a tramp, with this young man, the cruel gossip would do incalculable damage to her reputation. 

 Peter had blackmailed and humiliated her with the intention of bringing down the office bully. He had meant to tame her just a little to give everyone an easier life in the office but it went too far when he had sex with her. It didn't seem as though he need mention the threat to her job anymore. She was going along with whatever he wanted, for the moment. 

 He also found she became hot under the threat of exposure. Peter had heard about exhibitionists and he was quickly learning what turned her on. The hotter she got the less self-control she had, allowing him to take charge. At eighteen he wasn't an experienced adult so controlling a beautiful mature woman like this was a fantastic adventure. 

 At first he wanted to punish her for all those times he was put down by adults and students in a class above him. Now he was simply enjoying playing with a sexed up female. 

 "Just turn in here," Peter told her. 

 With a firm hand on the wheel there was little choice but drive into the parking lot. The convenience store was as in a downtrodden part of town adding to her nervous state. At least the store looked empty, of customers anyway. 

 "You'll be alright he's a friend of mine," Peter told her. He walked around the car to open her door. She sat staring at the shabby store front not wanting to get out. 

 "Please Peter, let's just go home," she protested. 

 He grabbed a wrist and pulled her out of the car. Not wanting to draw attention by making a fuss she said nothing more, with the intention of getting it over with as quickly as possible. He was determined to show her off to his friend so it would have to be endured. Maria looped her arm through his to walk close alongside him hoping the lack of clothing wouldn't be noticed. 

 "Don't forget, you're my girlfriend. Just do as I say and we can leave, Ok?" 

 "Sure, whatever you say, Peter," Maria answered. She wanted to tell him to make it quick only she knew he would embarrass her all the more. 

 "Hi Andy, meet Maria, what do you think?" he asked. 

 Andy didn't know what to say. The way she was dressed indicated she wasn't his aunt. She looked more like one of the prostitutes that came in for condoms. "Hi!" he said, nodding with a non-committal expression. 

 "Go get us some snacks and stuff," Peter told her. As she turned he slapped her bottom with a hand up the short slip. 

 Maria scuttled off to find a quiet out of the way corner to hide in. It was terrible knowing he was going to brag about her to his friend. Knowing how gross two eighteen year olds could be she definitely didn't want to hear their smutty talk. 

 "So it's her? You actually went through with it!" Andy exclaimed. "Wow!" he laughed. Watching her trip down the aisle to the back of the store was far more exciting knowing his friend had her at his mercy. 

 "That is just awesome. You got her to dress up like that! Wow! What's next?" Andy asked, with a look of admiration on his face. 

 "Not sure, you got any ideas?" Peter asked his friend. 

 Andy shrugged though he wanted to ask if he could borrow her for the night. When she got to the far corner he remembered the new stock on a rack behind her. He nodded his head in her direction. "We've got a new range of tights, you could get her to try them on," he said. 

 Peter didn't look interested, so he added. "The ones that fit all over, she could wear one instead of that dress," he leered suggestively. He almost told his friend they were popular with the street walkers but that might put him off. 

 "You mean a body stocking?" Peter asked. 

 "Yea, that's it, real tight," he confirmed. "Can you get her to wear stuff, like anything you want?" he said, with an obvious dare lighting his face. He had sold a few but could only imagine what they looked like on a voluptuous female body. 

 Peter walked down the aisle, picked a package from the rack and found Maria. Hustling her into the back-room didn't take as much effort as expected, but then he guessed she was happy to get out of the way in case a customer walked in. 

 "Some tights, try them on," he told her. "Here, give me the dress," Peter said. Before she could protest he had it up over her head. 

 Standing in her shoes, panties and nothing else, she covered her breasts. Apprehensively she looked toward the door fearing a show had been arranged for his friend. Peter had the garment unwrapped so she quickly pulled it up her legs. It was more than a pair of tights, it was a body stocking. At least it would be better than nothing under the slip. 

 He helped her pull it up, which was needed, as it was so tight. Maria figured his friend said something offensive about the skimpy little dress, so now he wanted to cover her up. At least with this on under the slip she wouldn't feel so vulnerable. 

 It felt way too small. When stretching it over both shoulders it was pulled tight between the cheeks, almost cutting her in two in front. He took her by the hand toward the door where she pulled back. "My slip!" she said, with an anxious whisper. 

 "You don't need that now, you're completely covered up," Peter told her, with a roguish smile. 

 "Its too tight," she started to say then looking down at her breasts she gasped. "I need to cover up." It was all she said before emerging into the brightly light store. Even without a mirror she could tell how the thin stretchy fabric clung to her body. She could feel it revealing every feminine curve. The light flesh colour made it look obscene. 

 With her free hand she covered her mouth stifling a yelp at being pulled into the store. The indignity of being paraded in a public place so exposed was shocking. The swell of her breasts was undisguised and her nipples were clearly protruding through it. 

 Maria was so taken with fright she meekly followed him through the store unable to look up in case there was anyone there. 

 At the far end of the store he stopped her before an old scratched mirror. She couldn't help looking at the image carefully, however embarrassing it was. She gasped, putting a hand to her mouth. A cursory glance would suppose she was naked. A stare would unmistakably discover protruding lips between her legs in the folds of the thin stretchy material. 

 If she had been wearing body pain it could not have been more revealing. The material had pulled between them separating her lips into a lewd presentation of a once private place. 

 Seeing his friend over her shoulder in the reflection she suddenly tensed. Her whole body shook and the slightest movement was plain to observe. Her breasts jiggled but were held in place with artful stitching and material reinforcement under them. It was designed to be worn under a slinky dress, not on show in a public place. 

 "Nice ass," Andy commented. Although she was a mature woman his reticence disappeared on seeing Peter's obvious demonstration of power over her. Peter had dressed her like a whore. Andy didn't need to treat her with the respect a powerful business-woman demanded if she bent to Peter's will so easily. 

 Maria felt their eyes all over her body taking in every detail and it was all on show. She didn't need to turn t the mirror to see her rear for she could feel how tight the bodysuit fitted between the cheeks. If felt as though it had been pulled up into her asshole. Andy could see it, as well as everything else, as he looked over her shoulder into the mirror. 

 Peter pumped her rump marvelling at the effect of the spandex gripping her ass. Her cheeks bounced a little but were held firmly in place. Andy joined in so both young men were bouncing her cheeks. If she had, or could get the keys to the car, she would have sprinted for it and driven home, despite the consequences. 

 Maria wanted to sob at this latest indignity. She could feel herself opening up! Looking into the mirror she could see it all happening. She had been tense and defensive yet now, it was clear to see, her pussy lips were swelling. Her last vestiges of privacy were lost. It was as though her inner most secrets were on display for all to see. 

 "Walk up and down," Peter told her. 

 Like a new toy the adolescent's watched every movement as she walked up and down the isle. Every muscle of her body was on show. They commented on her body with lavish compliments. They observed the bounce of her large breasts, the long legs flexing, a cute ass, and most embarrassing of all, how distended her pussy lips were. 

 However wrong it felt she couldn't help reacting to the bawdy comments. She began to sashay, wiggling her hips just a little, feeling her bottom wriggling in its tight confines. It was the shame that kept her under his control rather than the blackmail but she couldn't break out of the vicious circle. 

 The humiliation was heating her up making her more ashamed of herself and less able to fight back. While so vulnerable he controlled her, escalating the humiliation, which aroused her further so she became all the more susceptible to him. It was a terrible vicious circle she must escape before something dreadful happened. 

 The bell rang announcing customers. A big beefy man walked in with a young girl. She was about nineteen, dressed in a micro mini and skimpy halter top. The heavily plastered makeup alone announced her profession. He was nearer Maria's age. He wore plenty of gold with dark shades so as not to be blinded by its gaudy exuberance. He bobbed as he walked as though he had a Turkey stuffed up his shirt. 

 Maria shrunk behind Peter feeling so much worse at the sight of the young woman. She was a hooker yet Maria was showing off her body more lewdly. "Get me back in the storage room, please!" Maria whispered to Peter. 

 "Ok, let's go down the other aisle," he suggested. 

 They met Andy standing at the counter before they could pass into the back- room. "Hold on a minute," Andy said. "You guys, this is it," he called out, beckoning to the two customers. 

 Andy took a hold of her wrist preventing her from escaping unless she made a fuss. Breathing heavily from anxiety she kept her head down in shame not wanting to be there, especially dressed so provocatively. 

 "I'm taking her to get changed," Peter told his friend. 

 "I can't sell that thing now. Who's going to pay for it?" Andy asked looking at them both. It was obvious she had nothing on her and Peter patted his empty pockets. 

 "You can earn it by modelling it to customers," Andy told her. His brisk tone halted Peter and he still had a tight hold of her wrist. 

 Maria looked from one to the other of the two young men. She didn't have the physical or mental strength to escape them. 

 This afternoon she had been a confident manager of over fifty staff, CEO of the Eastern Division, with a plush office in the most prestigious tower in the city. Now she was a bundle of nerves working for this young stranger, modelling a rude body-suit, in a shabby convenience store. 

 The two customers ambled over. The young woman looked Maria up and down with disdain. "You expect me to wear that?" she asked the man. "It's gross, and impractical," she pointed out. 

 Maria cringed in pain on hearing a whore reject what she was wearing as too explicit. 

 "What do you mean, impractical?" he asked. "Oh! Yea!" he laughed. 

 "You could open it up here," Andy said, with a hand on Maria's crotch. "Walk up and down, show them it in motion," Andy told her with a push setting her in motion. 

 "I like it, the John's can see what their getting. She's well behaved too, unlike some others that work for me," he said, with a sarcastic laden voice referring to the young woman. 

 She crossed her arms showing annoyance at having her opinion ignored. 

 Maria wanted to weep but continued to walk up and down. She looked for Peter but he had sloped off. Timidly she stopped by Andy not knowing what to do now Peter had deserted her. How could she run away into the night wearing this lewd body stocking as anyone stopping would only want one thing, her. 

 "I like the look of this, how much you want for her?" the man asked. 

 The young woman turned her head toward him like a mantis eyeing up prey, saying nothing, letting the angry expression speak for her. 

 "She's booked for the night," Andy said. 

 Maria cringed at Andy's defence as he had just told them she was a whore. She wanted to run but was frightened of the woman and so terrified of the man she couldn't bring herself to speak, let alone move. 

 "I meant buy her, to work for me," he laughed quietly. It was nothing like a sound of pleasure, more like a vibrant snakes hiss only deeper. "She shouldn't be working here, this area it's mine. I'll take her off your hands," he growled. 

 The man mentioned a large sum to Andy which brought Maria's attention back to them. Understanding of what the pimp meant slowly crept into her head like a dark shadow leaving her mind cowering in a corner. She looked at Andy with eyes wide trying to catch his attention. She glanced at the door wondering why she didn't just walk away from these nasty people. 

 Her legs refused to move. Her mouth hung wide as though she were the village idiot. Her mind emptied of all thoughts leaving an understanding of just two devastating facts. This man wanted to pay for her, to buy her, to work as his prostitute! The second fact was the most devastating. Andy was overawed by the amount of money being offered and was considering it! 

 Maria looked at Andy imploring him to refuse. From her silence the powerful man thought Andy had some hold over her as a pimp would. It wasn't Andy that stopped her screaming at them or running away. It was this new condition that afflicted her; becoming helpless from humiliation, unable to function. 

 She could understand the man buying an asset that would earn him a return but she wasn't for sale. The very thought of being purchased as a sex object was absolutely degrading and still more disturbing was how aroused she had become. 

 She felt like a fragile little thing ready to be broken underfoot. The powerful feelings of arousal and shame overcame her moral fibre leaving her so very vulnerable. She was convinced this powerful man could dominate her and lead her away to a life of debauchery. She was ready to plead with Andy to save her. He was her only hope. 

 Being completely dependent upon Andy she resorted to speaking to him as she would have done to Peter. "Please sir," Maria mumbled. 

 They all looked at her. They didn't see a powerful business woman who dominated an office full of staff, efficiently running a prosperous division of a national corporation. They saw a pathetic whore who could be easily manipulated and controlled. 

 "Don't worry girl I won't put you on the streets. I'll rig you out in expensive clothes for executives on expense accounts, in my whorehouse," the pimp told her. 

 His predatory smile brought on a cold shiver down her backbone. The young woman looked at her with contempt and envy. Andy looked at her in awe thinking about the amount of money he would gain. 

 Maria imagined the ignominy of serving her body to executives from head office. Even her staff could make use of her in a brothel! In an aroused state she would be unable to refuse anything the customers wanted, always ready to perform the most contemptible of sexual acts. 

 Peter came up and stood right behind Maria placing his hands firmly on her shoulders. He was well out of his depth having never been this close to a hooker and her pimp before. Peter raised his shoulders, took a deep breath, and pushed out his chest to stand taller. This pimp wasn't having his Maria for the night. 

 Andy caught the tension and looked at his friend. He didn't want a fight to break out, messing up the place, as the boss would take any damage out of his wage. Besides, Peter wouldn't stand a chance against this street experience man. 

 "Sorry, I didn't know this was your area, she's going now anyway," Andy said. He tried not to sound nervous but the tremble in his voice was clear. 

 Peter new nothing of the violence these people lived by so he was ready to brazen it out. He took Maria's wrist, twisting her toward the door, almost dragging her out of the store. 

 They sped away with Peter driving this time. He was furious not knowing if it were him, Andy or the pimp he was most angry with. He couldn't look at Maria. His eyes focused on the dark road back into town. 

 Maria couldn't get out of her mind how close she had come to spending the rest of her life as a whore. Spending everyday performing for strangers was a terrifying thought, but now safe, it was becoming such an overpowering arousal she couldn't waist to get home. 

 "Thank you Peter," she simpered, with rapid little breaths. She undid the seat belt and leaned over into his lap. Pulling his cock from the jeans she kissed it gently. The head rapidly expanded with a hand stroking his balls and the other gripping the lengthening cock. 

 She slurped noisily over the head of his cock oblivious to how things had changed. Earlier while driving she had reluctantly let him put his head in her lap. She licked the full length of his dick down to his balls to tenderly take them into her mouth. They hardened like huge walnuts. 

 She licked and kissed up its length to the tip which she sucked on for a moment to tease it into full manhood. She pushed her pursed lips over the head of his cock purposely making it a tight fit. Gripping the fattening cock with her lips she pushed down its length feeling it hitting the back of her throat. 

 Unable to bring her self to swallow it she began to run her head back up to start a rhythmic head bobbing. 

 The car bounced off the road hitting the dirt with the suspension screeching and only just recovering from the sudden diversion. They came to a rest with the engine stalled, ticking loudly, in a cloud of dust swirling about in the dark. 

 Maria had his cock suddenly thrust down her throat and was now choking, unable to breath. 

 Next thing she knew they were both over the seats into the back fighting for a tenable position, clawing at what was left of their clothes. A hole was torn in the crotch of the body stocking and at last she felt him enter. 

 He thrust in powerfully without the least restraint blissfully unaware of how easily he took her. As the hardness touched her lips she absorbed it into her body as though he were feeding her starving body. They fell to a frantic rhythm desperate for satisfaction. 

 The lights of cars passing went unseen. Their eyes were screwed up tight as though concentrating on the most important thing in the world, as though their lives depended upon it. She moaned in syllables of delight while he grunted out-breaths of sound. 

 It seemed like only seconds but it was many minutes of effort, the heat steaming up the windows, until they fell exhausted. They clamped each other tight in desperation to become one being. 

 He lay in her arms with his face pressed into her breasts. She held onto him with both hands holding tight. For some time they lay there murmuring to each other unintelligible sounds that they both understood perfectly well. 

 Eventually they surfaced. Peter handed her the dress he grabbed earlier from the back-room. With glowing faces they pulled themselves together. It was a struggle to clamber over the seats in their weakened state but neither of them wanted to leave the little world that had been created between them. 

 "I'll drive home and get some clothes," Peter told her. There had been no need to discuss where they were bound for. This was just a necessary diversion on the way to her house, her bed. Something had been started that needed completing, maybe never finishing, and needing further exploration. Report_Story
