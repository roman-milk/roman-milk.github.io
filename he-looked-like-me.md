 ****** He Looked Like Me Ch.01 ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© (c) Tx Tall Tales ===================== 

 My first time as a birthday present. 

 Doing a re-edit to my last chapter in the Two Moms, Two Laps series, so I thought I'd toss this out there, while I'm waiting. 

 Simple little story about a good deed, and the ample rewards. First chapter is the build up. Second chapter is the pay off. Both completed and will be submitted one day apart. 

 Yes, this is a LW story, but not a cheating, humiliating or cuck story. Not even a slut-wife story, although our heroine does misbehave, within the bounds of their marriage. 

 ===================== 

 I was doing a little shopping, picking up a few items, when I noticed her. 

 Tall, deceptively so. The two-inch platform, six-inch beige heels were too much for her to maneuver in her state. She stumbled along, beside, I assumed, her husband. 

 The put upon man looked embarrassed, as his wife's wobbling walk meandered along nearby. Every so often she'd stumble a little, her knee flexing outward, her foot turning. She looked drunk off her ass, and I was wondering what she was doing shopping in that condition. 

 I figured her for 30ish. Great body, wrapped in a single lightweight clingy stretch dress that reached half-way down her thighs. I was happy to follow them down the aisle for the view. 

 I lost them, skipping a few rows to hit the frozen foods aisle. I had just loaded my basket when I felt the weight on my arm. 

 There she was, clinging to my bicep, the smell of alcohol overpowering anything else she might be wearing. I was hunched over the basket, weight on my elbows, as I was walking. She had stumbled into me, and latched on. 

 "I'm sorry, baby. I'll make it up to you. Promise. Make you feel wunnerful," she whispered, her head hanging low, pressed against the side of my shoulder. 

 I looked around and didn't see the other half of her party nearby. Don't know why, but I didn't disabuse her of the idea I was her husband. 

 I walked slowly, the clunk of her awkward shoes out-pacing my own quieter steps. 

 "Don't be mad," she said softly. I almost leaped out of my skin when her hand slid down my front, grasping my crotch. "Suck you dry tonight, big boy. Suck, suck, suck." 

 I gently moved her hand away, just in time. I saw her husband's back, at the end of the aisle, and he appeared to be looking around for something. I had a pretty good idea what. 

 We walked over and I pulled up beside him. "I think you lost something," I said grinning. 

 His eyes blew open, and I thought he was going to have a fit, but then his features softened. "Dana," he said softly. 

 She looked up at him, and smiled, a big stupid drunken smile. She was still clinging to my arm, and didn't seem to notice the incongruency of her actions. 

 It was an odd little scene, he, standing there, eyebrows lifted, waiting. Dana leaning against me, her arm through mine, smiling for her husband. I stood quietly, not wanting to be part of any big scene. 

 "Can we go home?" she said. 

 He started chuckling as I pulled her arm off of mine, and eased her over to her husband. She took a half-dozen tiny wobbly steps, and grabbed onto him for support. I don't even think she knew I was there. 

 It was then I realized part of his wife's problem. 

 We were very similar. Both around 6' tall, probably 190# or so, wide bodies. Dark hair, pretty short. White polo shirts. Jeans. From behind, it was easy enough to see how she'd made the mistake. I was maybe a inch or so taller, but other than that, remarkably similar. 

 "Sorry about that," he said, turning his wife to face me. It was the first time I'd seen her head on, and I was momentarily stunned by how beautiful she was. She squinted at me, and her cute little nose and forehead crinkled up in confusion. "Birthday celebration started early. I'm gonna kill those friends of hers," he explained. 

 Dana looked back and forth between us, then leaned her head against her husband's shoulder. "Please don't be mad," she whined. 

 We parted ways, and I figured it was over. I'd have a cute little story to tell at work on Monday. 

 In the parking lot, I walked toward my car. There was an open space about two away from mine, and as I walked by, I heard the crying before I saw anything. 

 She was sitting on the ground, tears running down her cheeks. It was not a very demure position, her legs crossed, her bare crotch exposed, where her dress had ridden up. 

 I stopped and reached down to pull her to her feet. She looked up and threw herself into my arms. "Don't leave me, Gary! I'm sorry!" 

 "Shh," I said, holding her upright. "I'm not your husband. Where did he go?" 

 She looked into my face, squinting. "You!" she blurted, and swung her hand at my face. 

 I dodged it and gave her a little shake. "Stop that!" 

 "Why'd you get me in trouble?" she whined. "I di'nt do nothin'." She started crying. 

 "Dana, where's your husband?" I repeated. 

 She shook her head. "He lef' me," she sobbed. She looked up at me again, confusion reigning. "Do I know you?" 

 "Come on. I'll take you home. You're in no shape to be out here by yourself." 

 She agreed, an indication of how drunk she was. She let me move her to my arm, and she clung on for the 20 feet or so it took to get to the car. I let her in, fastened her seatbelt, resisting some very reasonable urges, and backed out of the space. "Where do you live?" 

 She gave me the address, after a couple of tries. They were new to the neighborhood, only about a mile from my house. My GPS gave me the needed directions, and I listened to her whine about her situation for the few minutes it took to get her home. 

 "Di'nt give my panties away," she sulked. "I forgot them at Sheri's this morning. I was inna hurry, get home. Bitches wouldn't let me go till I f...finished my birthday shots. Not my fault." 

 "Birthday shots?" 

 "Twenty eight. I on'y did 17 las' night. Then dey spank me!" 

 "Spanked you last night?" 

 She was struggling with the seatbelt, and got it undone. She turned her butt toward me, getting on her knees, and lifted the bottom of her skirt. "This mornin'! I wasn't fuckin' no one, they spank' me!" 

 Cute little pink cheeked butt. One foot was on the floor, opening her up. I saw her puffy bare pussy was very red. "They spanked your pussy?" 

 She straightened out her dress, and sat down. 

 "Carla. Bitch. She starteded it and th'others wouldn't stop. Twenty-eight, each. All five of 'em." She crossed her arms, sulking. "Gonna get 'em back. Got me in trouble." 

 The image of her being held down, legs parted, and five women taking turns slapping her pussy was getting me worked up. 

 I pulled up to her house, and the driveway was empty. "You sure this is where you live?" 

 She nodded. "Know m'own house," she pouted. 

 I got her out of the car, enjoying another crotch shot. I walked her to the door, and after a minute of watching her fumble with her keys, took them from her and unlocked the house. 

 She stumbled toward the couch, and fell on her hands and knees. I lifted her and laid her on the couch, pulling her dress down, after stealing another titillating look. 

 "You're a nice guy," she said softly, wiggling into a comfortable position. "Wass your name?" 

 "Jack," I laughed. 

 "Whasso funny?" 

 "You showed me your butt, and only now ask me my name?" 

 She grinned. "Naughty. You wanna blowjob?" 

 "Of course I do, Dana. You're gorgeous. But it's not going to happen." 

 "I promised. I 'member, in the store. Suck you dry." She had her eyes closed, talking softly. She'd pass out before she finished me once, never mind sucking me dry. Besides, I'm not the kind of guy to take advantage of a drunken woman. Especially not a married one. Not after my own personal experience. No way. 

 "Suck, fuck, fuck, suck," she whispered. "Iss my birfday." She practically sang the ending. Damn, she was cute. 

 I grabbed an afghan off a nearby chair and draped it over her. I leaned down and gave her a kiss on the forehead. "Happy Birthday, Dana." 

 She smiled for me, already half-asleep. 

 I was torn between watching over her, and getting out while the getting was good. The decision was made for me when her husband came in through the kitchen. "DANA!" he shouted. 

 "She's out, on the couch," I said softly, walking toward him. 

 He stopped short, whether because of my comment, or my presence, I wasn't sure. I saw him blush. "You brought her home?" 

 I nodded. "Couldn't leave her there. Not in her condition." 

 "She... she got out of the car. She was screaming. Ran between the cars. I... told her she could walk home, but I didn't mean it. It was stupid, I just wanted her to calm down. That's all, calm down. I drove to the end of the row and waited. She never came back. When I drove back to where I left her she was gone. I drove up and down all the rows, checked the entrance. Even had her paged. I... I thought I lost her. Didn't know what to think. I've never been so scared." 

 I could see how upset he was. 

 "She didn't even have her purse. It was in the car. Couldn't call her. I was scared to death." 

 "It's alright now. She's lying down. I didn't do anything to her. I hope you believe that." 

 He nodded. "Figure you wouldn't be here if you did. Probably at your place or a motel. I really fucked up, didn't I?" 

 "Not my call. Screwed up enough on my own not to judge anyone else. She tell you about last night?" 

 "Her sorority bitch friends. Taking her out to get her drunk and laid. Evil sluts." 

 I shook my head. "Twenty-eight shots, for twenty-eight years. Eleven this morning, when she was still probably half-hammered from last night. Spanked the shit out of her, twenty-eight swats each. Apparently most of them between her legs, instead of on her ass." 

 "She told you all that?" 

 "Yeah. Swore she didn't screw around. I believe her, although I guess that doesn't matter. Pretty incriminating, drunk as a skunk, no panties, and red as a beet down there." 

 "You saw?" I could see the anger building. 

 I decided to shade the truth a little. "She was sitting on the pavement, her dress halfway up her waist. I'm sure she didn't realized she was showing the entire world the results of her birthday spanking." 

 "Fuck. Yeah, it looked pretty bad, didn't it?" 

 That bald little pussy looked anything but bad, but I wasn't going to go there. I nodded for propriety's sake. 

 "I need a beer. You wanna beer? I'm gonna have a beer. Maybe a six-pack." 

 Weird situation. C'mon, give me that much. Bizarre. "Sure, why not?" 

 We took the beers into the living room, and he sat down on the couch next to his wife. I sat across from him on their love-seat. We did formal introductions, and talked about the area, and them just moving in. TrÃ¨s weird, talking for half an hour, his gorgeous drunk wife laying there, passed out. 

 "It's nice around here. I moved in almost five years ago. Back when it wasn't much more than farmland," I said. 

 She snorted, turned and stretched her legs out. He pulled them onto his lap, stroking her flesh. The afghan hid anything going on above mid-thigh. Personally, I would have removed her shoes, but he seemed to enjoy touching her feet, in those crazy tall heels. 

 He shook his head. "Out of control when she gets like this. I should never have agreed to let her go out with them. Whenever they get together, it's bad." 

 "Tell me about it. Had a girl for a while, few years back. Everything a man could ask for: kind, beautiful, sexy, loving. She had a switch, somewhere around half-a-dozen drinks, where she'd lose all inhibitions. Jump in the pool naked, kiss all our friends, drag me to the bathroom for a quick blowjob in the middle of a party." 

 I took a drink of my beer, dredging up old, painful memories. "Unfortunately, one time, somewhere after 10 drinks or so, Linda forgot who her fiancÃ©e was, and got gangbanged for it. Tried to keep it a secret, but within a week everybody knew. Every one of our friends. Broke up two marriages. Humiliated me. I never heard the end of it. So I dumped her and moved back to Texas after that. I couldn't trust her. She swore she'd stop drinking, but I was young and unforgiving. Couldn't get past what she'd done. Too bad, I thought she was the one. The love of my life." 

 He nodded, and I saw the afghan had slipped, and his hand was between her legs, rubbing her. "Exactly. I want to trust her. I love her to death. But when she's drunk, well you saw how she is. Add those slut college friends, and who knows what's going on? Wouldn't surprise me if they took on the whole bar, with my wife as the main attraction. Fucked everyone there blind." 

 "Di'nt fuck anyone," she said, trying to raise up a little. She dropped one leg to the floor, exposing herself completely to me. 

 "You sure?" her husband asked. 

 She wrinkled her forehead, concentrating. "Pretty sure. Dirty dancin'. Someone kissed me. Maybe a few. But we left." She grinned. "I 'member. Told 'em I was married. Wouldn't take my rings off. I'm a good girl now." 

 I had a hard-on that was like to tear a hole in my jeans. Gary still had his hand on her crotch, rubbing her. Too fucking weird for words. 

 "Good girl now?" he asked, teasing a little. I saw his grin. 

 She nodded, drunken smile lighting up her face. "Yep. Jus' my wunnerful husband." She reached her hand down, and covered his with hers. "Naughty hubby. Jenny gave some guy a blowjob. In'a booth. One a the guys kept tryin' to touch me down there. I hit him." She sounded awfully proud, waving her little fist in the air. 

 "You b'lieve me, baby? I was good. I promise," she said, seemingly on the verge of tears. 

 "Yes, I believe you." 

 She leaned back, grinning. "I'm a good girl. Iss my birfday." 

 She sat up again. "Where's my frien'? He brought me home. You lef' me!" she pouted. 

 "I'm still here, Dana." I said. 

 She turned her head slowly, wrinkling her forehead, squinting. So God-damn cute. "Jack?" 

 "Over here." 

 She grinned. "He was nice. Di'nt try nothin'. I showed him my spankin'." 

 Her husband sighed. "I'm still very cross with you, Dana. You promised to be home by 2:00 am. Then your friends call at 4:00 and say they're bringing you back by 9:00. You show up past noon, drunk off your ass, half your clothing missing, and without your car. Your pussy all swelled up, almost closed, bright red. Worse than our honeymoon." 

 She nodded. "I tol' em. I did! I tol' 'em and tol' em. My hubby waitin'. Get all hot 'n bothered, bring it home to him. I tol' 'em!" 

 "They're trouble." 

 She pouted. "They're my bes' friends, Gary. They took care of me, make sure I don' get in trouble." 

 I laughed, and Gary looked at me quizzically. At least Dana had lifted her leg back into his lap, for a semblance of decency, even if his hand was still between her legs. 

 "Maybe you should have this conversation when she can remember it," I said. 

 He nodded. "Did yours have trouble-making friends?" 

 "Yeah. Three of them. One was the cancer. I made the mistake of demanding she give her up." 

 "Why mistake?" 

 "She didn't give her up, just lied and hid it. Made it worse. Got used to lying to me, and her friend hated my guts after that. It was her that set my girl up for the gangbang." 

 "Set her up?" Gary asked. 

 "The way Linda told it, she got caught in the bedroom with one guy, blind drunk, and started to flirt a little. Teasing, like she did when she got that way. Another joined them, and the flirting got more and more carried away. Someone was always kissing her, stopping her from complaining, feeding her booze. Teasing her, sneakily undressing her, until one was inside her. She didn't even know which one. Once they started in on her, her so-called best friend just kept bringing every single guy in the party to go up and have at her. A few married ones as well. At least eight that we know of." 

 "What a bitch," Gary said. 

 "I never lie t'you, baby," Dana said, apparently paying at least partial attention. "My friends wouldn't do that. They know I love you, and you're the on'y one for me. They take care of me. They do." 

 She sat up and crawled over to him, her short dress stuck up around her hips. She wrapped her arms around her husband. "Please don't take 'em away from me. I don't hardly get to see 'em no more. Don' make it worse." She was rubbing against him, straddling one leg, her bare ass capturing most of my attention. "Please? For my birfday?" She said the last part in a little girl's voice. Fuck, that was hot. 

 I laughed again. "She really milks the birthday thing, doesn't she?" 

 He nodded grinning. "We both do. She's usually very good about it." 

 "Very good? You said I'm a best! The bestes' ever!" 

 He lifted her chin up and kissed her. "You are, sweetie. The best ever." 

 She leaned her head on his shoulder. "I'll make it up t'you. You know I will. Your birfday in two months. Even better'n las' year." 

 He laughed out loud. "I don't think that's even possible." 

 "Better. All 'ranged. I promise." 

 She turned in his lap, sitting sideways, and looked across the short space at me. "Him." 

 "Him, what?" Gary asked. 

 "I want him. For my birfday. You promised." 

 I saw him turn red. "I thought we agreed on Derek?" he said softly. 

 "No. You wanted Derek. I want him," she said, sticking her arm out and pointing at me. 

 "Baby..." 

 "You promised! You said a stranger, not any friend. No one from work. No assholes. Tha's what you said!" 

 "I know, but why him? We don't even know him," Gary argued. I was on Dana's side. Unfortunately it looked like he might have had something worked out with Derek. 

 "He's nice. Wasn't mean to me. Di'nt take advan'age." She giggled. "He looks like you. Without my contacts, it's like twins. Hot. Really hot." 

 "But Dana, we already told Derek. We don't even know if Jack would want to do something like that." 

 "Ask him," she argued. "I don' want Derek. He's creepy. He wouldn' of been nice like my Jack." 

 "No, honey. It's too late to change it now." 

 She was one determined little drunk girl. "You promised! Don't want Derek. I want my Jack!" She started in with the wheedling. "Di'nt you like your birfday present?" 

 "I loved my birthday present, baby, but we have plans." 

 "No Jack, no more special birthdays!" she pouted, crossing her arms angrily. "None! I'll cancel. Call it off." She snuggled up to him, suddenly grinning. "You don' want me to cancel. It's the bestest ever." 

 She was good. I saw him wavering. I had a feeling this might be a great night. Incredible, even. 

 "Alright, but you ask him," he said, looking down and avoiding my eyes. 

 She squealed and gave him a big hug and kiss. She stumbled getting off the couch, but managed to stay upright and walk over to me. She tugged the bottom of her dress in place, demurely, smiling. She was trying to be sexy, and it was cute as hell, seeing her perfect hips swaying, the inebriated sultry look failing miserably. Didn't make her any less hot in my eyes. 

 She was very deliberate about it, moving in front of me, carefully climbing in my lap, straddling me, outstretched arms on each side of my head. She leaned closer, looking into my eyes. 

 "You wanna share me with my hubby, Jack? I can give you tha' blowjob I promised. A lot more. Everythin'. Can I have you for my birthday present?" 

 I reached down and slid my hands up her legs, under her dress, feeling her smooth flesh. "Nothing weird?" I asked. 

 "No, naughty boy," she giggled. "Share me. Both of you. Fuck my brains out. Make me go crazy. It's my fantasy." 

 "And you chose me for it?" 

 She grinned. "I like you. And you're jus' like my wunnerful hubby. Big. Tall, dark and handsome. I bet once we get goin', I won't even know which is which. God, that makes me wet." 

 She grabbed my hand and put it between her legs. She wasn't lying. 

 "I'd love to share you, Dana. You sure you want to do it now? Are you up to it? You could barely stay awake."  

 

 ****** He Looked Like Me Ch.01 ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© She grinned. "No more drinkin'. Maybe a li'l coffee to perk me up. I'll be good. I promise. Don't you want me?" she pouted. 

 "I'm not sure I ever wanted anything more," I confessed. 

 She looked over her shoulder at Gary. "Coffee! Stat!" she chuckled afterward. Then before I knew it, her lips were on mine, and I was kissing her, oblivious to all else. 

 She chose me. 

 She was so damn sexy. Probably could have any man she wanted. I bet she turned away dozens the night before. And she chose me. All because her husband looked like me. 

 I was going to do my damnedest to make sure she didn't regret it. 

 She was grinding against my crotch, when I grabbed her hips, getting a good grip, before I stood up. She moaned against my mouth, then pulled her head away, gasping. "I knew it was you," she whispered. "My Jack." 

 "Let's move this to the couch for a bit," I told her, walking across the living room floor. I turned and sat back on the couch. 

 She was kissing me again, when Gary showed back up. He sat down next to me, and she climbed off my lap, and into his. 

 "Whoa! Careful, babe!" he said, holding her coffee up and out of the way. He had two beer bottles by the neck in his other hand. 

 She didn't seem to care, wrapping her arms around his neck, kissing him passionately. "I love you sooo much. Thank you. Promise you won't regret it." 

 He handed her the coffee, and I saw she drank it black. It looked strong. 

 I had a personal opinion about that. The darker and stronger a woman liked her coffee, the more open she seemed to be about oral. Espresso girls swallow. Nothing scientific, just personal experience. I was looking forward to another data point confirming my ad-hoc research. 

 Gary passed me a beer, and then held his up for a toast. "To my beautiful, sexy wife. On her birthday." 

 I clinked my bottle against his. "I'll drink to that. She's gorgeous. You're a lucky man." 

 He grinned. It seemed once he gave in, most of his concerns had vanished. "And you're the lucky man who gets to find out just how lucky I am." 

 Dana giggled. "I'm the luckiest. Bestest hubby in the world, and a han'some new boyfrien'." 

 I sipped my beer, while I watched her rub herself all over her man. It seemed like she was in heat. I figured that for a good thing. After a bit, she climbed off of him, and into my lap. She somehow managed to avoid spilling her coffee, and after a minute of kissing, she'd drink a little more. 

 I felt Gary tap me on the shoulder, and he held out his hand, closed. I opened mine underneath his, and he dropped a pill into it. "What is it?" I asked. 

 "Stamina. We've got a big job ahead of us. I promised we'd wear her out. Not even sure if that's possible." 

 Dana leaned back, giving a little shimmy, her firm breasts wiggling enticingly. "Wear. Me. Out!" 

 She sipped her coffee, while I downed the medicinal helper. It wasn't the little blue pill I'd seen, and even used a couple of times. Something different, but I didn't know enough about all the different alternatives to recognize it. 

 She handed the coffee cup to her husband, and faced me. "Undress me, han'some. I wanna be nekkid." 

 I reached down and pulled her dress over her head, exposing her bare body. Heart stopping. Her face was beautiful, but that body! Damn! Tits weren't huge, but they were gorgeous, and seemed to fit her perfectly. I found out they fit my hands pretty damn well. Slender waist, flawless skin, sexy tan lines that showed the parts of her that only her husband and doctors usually got to see. 

 "Cat got your tongue?" she teased. 

 "You're fantastic," I said. 

 "And only for my hubby. My wunnerful, perfect hubby. Han'some hubby. Until now. You like?" 

 "I love." 

 She pouted cutely. "No fallin' in love. You can like, even super-duper like. No love though. My love is only for hubby, and on'y he gets to love me." 

 "I super-duper like," I told her, grinning. 

 Gary had left for a minute, and returned, handing her a bottle of water. He took her hand and put some pills in it. I wondered a little about his pharmaceutical approach to sex. 

 "What?" she asked, squinting and looking in her hand. 

 "Aspirin. I don't want you claiming a headache a few hours from now." 

 She smiled, and took them, drinking down half the water. "Mmm. I was really thirsty. This is good." 

 I felt odd, holding his naked wife in my lap, while we were both clothed. I wasn't going to make the first move to change that. 

 She was rolling her hips, teasing me. "You eat pussy, Jack?" 

 I nodded. "I guarantee I'll eat your sweet little pussy." 

 "Even if it's dirty?" she asked, giving me a mischievous look. 

 "I... uh... haven't." The idea didn't do anything for me. Just the opposite, to be honest. 

 "How about if it's just a little dirty?" she asked, watching me carefully. 

 "Dana, for you, tonight, I'm willing. Never before, but for you? It's your special night. Your birthday. What kind of present would I be, if I didn't take care of you?" 

 She turned to Gary, smirking. "See? I tol' you! My Jack'll take care of me. Jus' like you. Derek wouldn'. I knew it. Jack's a giver, not a taker." 

 Gary's hand caressed her side. "He's your present. It's cool. I just felt bad 'cause we'd already told Derek. He was really looking forward to tonight." 

 Yeah, I bet. I kinda felt bad for the guy. I could only imagine how I'd feel if they changed their minds now. 

 "You better should call 'im," Dana said. 

 "I did, while making your coffee. He's not happy, but I guess he's going to have to live with it." 

 She moved over to his lap, teasing him. "I'm sowwy. We'll make it up to him, Ok? Not like t'night, but we'll think of something, a'right?" 

 He nodded. "A little something. That's all. Changing your mind doesn't get you two for one." 

 She giggled. "Don't want him. I'll do a li'l somethin' for you. 'Cause you promised. Maybe give him a show. That's all. All I want is my wunnerful, wunnerful hubby, and my Jack." 

 I had to admit, she didn't seem as drunk as she'd been. I don't know if it was the hour long nap, the booze wearing off, the coffee, or the situation. She still was slurring her words a bit, and seemed a little off kilter, but she was looking and sounding better. 

 She hopped up, abruptly. "I wanna dance for my men." 

 She wobbled over to the stereo, bringing her face within a few inches of the CDs, her sexy ass pointed our way. Damn, I was gonna hit that. Hard. 

 "Why don't you put your contacts in, baby?" 

 "Don't wanna. I like it fuzzy. Sexy. My two men a li'l blurry. Might even wanna wear a blindfold. Would you like that, won'erful hubby? Blindfold me and bang the hell out of me with our friend?" 

 She was already starting to sway to the music. She raised her hands high, her body undulating, more pronounced. She was amazing. She turned, giving us the full view. 

 "Talk about me," she purred. "Like I wasn't even here. Like I didn't matter." 

 Gary laughed. "You ever seen anything like that?" 

 I shook my head. "Can't say I have. And you live with that 365 days a year?" 

 "366 on leap year. Jealous?" 

 "Hell yeah. I think tonight, I'm the second luckiest man in the world." 

 "Only the second luckiest?" he chuckled. 

 She was moving closer, shimmying, shaking her ass, trying to get our attention. 

 "You, sir, are without a doubt, the luckiest. I swear, I've never seen anyone more beautiful. So sweet I want to eat her up." 

 He grinned. "Hell yeah, I'll drink to that." 

 We toasted our beers, and for a brief moment I wondered where I should draw the line drinking. Didn't want to have any performance issues. 

 Dana was close enough that her legs were touching ours, adapting her dancing to each new song. I reached out and caressed her thigh. 

 "Honestly," Gary said. "You think I should make waves about those evil friends of hers?" 

 "I'm not the best to give advice, but I'd say no. I think she's true to you. Don't you?" 

 He nodded. "She had me worried." 

 That was too much for Dana. "No baby! I would never do anythin' without you. Never! They know it." 

 "You know the old saying, 'Keep your friends close...'" I said. 

 "'...and your enemies closer.' I don't think they're really enemies, just trouble-makers." 

 "So you tell them. Let them know you appreciate their taking care of her, but the way they left her was over the line. That's all. Not mean, but let them know they almost messed things up. Don't alienate them." 

 Dana giggled. "You really don't wanna do that, honey. Aliuh-hate. Trus' me, it would ruin your birthday present." 

 She leaned over him, arms braced against the back of the couch, shaking her tits. "Everyone knows. You're the best. That's why they'd never hurt you. Never make things bad for us. Only for you." 

 "What 'only for me?'" 

 She giggled, rubbing her tits against his face. "That would be tellin'. You have to wait. For your birthday." 

 She moved over to me, and gave me a full frontal body rub, before turning and grinding that perfect firm ass into my crotch. I grabbed her cheeks, holding them while they swiveled. God, I wanted her bad. 

 "She did cross the line, though," Gary said, watching her intently. 

 "Just a little, honey," she said over her shoulder. "I wasn't bad. Jus' late." 

 "And drunk off your ass," he reminded her. 

 She pouted cutely. "I'm sorry. It really wasn't my fault." 

 "What do you think? She gets off scot-free?" he said to me. 

 "I think you've punished her enough, scaring the crap out of her in the parking lot." 

 "She scared the hell out of me," he said, obviously still a little irritated with her. 

 "Then punish her. Spank that gorgeous ass, and move on. Let her know the next time it will be worse, and her friends won't be immune from the punishment if they keep it up." 

 Dana laughed. "Yes! Spank their asses, Gary. It was their fault. 'Specially Carla. Make that bitch scream!" 

 "And you're faultless?" 

 She pouted. "You want to spank me? On my birthday?" 

 He laughed. "They did, didn't they?" 

 She nodded. 

 "Get over here." 

 She looked nervous as she stretched out across his lap. She yelped loudly when the first heavy blow slammed down against her ass cheek. Her head was on my thigh and I pulled her hair back, holding her. 

 "You were bad, Dana. Leaving me worried like that. Up all night, hardly sleeping. Not knowing what you were doing with those sluts. Running off in the parking lot." 

 He smacked her other cheek, the crack of his hand loud, making her cry out again. "Coming home with an abused pussy? What was I supposed to think?" 

 "I tried to stop 'em," she whined. 

 Two more quick, sharp blows. "Get up and get me the phone," he snapped. 

 She looked worried as she jogged off to do as he demanded, cute little high- heeled steps. She returned moments later. 

 "Call Sheri." 

 "Why?" 

 "Don't ask questions! Get in position, and call her." 

 She pouted, and dialed the number, before laying across his lap. Gary took the phone from her. Put it on speaker. 

 "Dana?" a voice asked. 

 "No, Sheri. It's Gary. Dana's being punished." 

 "Don't be hard on her, Gary. She was good. I'm sorry we made her a little late." 

 "Little? She was supposed to be at home by 2:00! Then I was told, not asked but told, she'd be home by 9:00. What time did she show up, dead drunk, ruining all our plans for the day?" 

 "A little after noon," the voice answered. 

 "I want to trust you guys together, Sheri. I do. You're making it very difficult." He smacked his wife on the ass, then again. 

 "What was that?" Sheri asked nervously. 

 "She's getting punished. Severely. Next time, she won't be the only one, do you understand?" 

 "What are you doing to her?" 

 "Spanking me," Dana whined. "Really hard. You guys shouldn'a spanked my pussy like that. He got really mad. Thought I was fuckin' around." 

 "Shit. We didn't mean to. That damn Carla..." 

 Smack, smack, smack. The blows came down quickly, making Dana scream. 

 "Don't hurt her, Gary. I'm sorry. We're all sorry." 

 "Anyone else out of your crowd still there?" 

 "Y...yeah. Jenny and Donna." 

 "Put them on speaker. Let them know this is their fault too." 

 A few seconds later we could hear the multiple voices. 

 "How many is that?" Gary asked. 

 "I dunno," Dana whined. 

 "I guess I'll have to start over." 

 "Nine," I said. 

 "You sure?" he asked. 

 "Nine." 

 He wasn't that hard on her, but he did give her the remaining spanks, and she screamed out like he was killing her. I think it was mostly an act she was putting on for her phone audience. 

 "Stop it, Gary! You're going to kill her!" one of the voices called out. 

 "Next time, follow the damn rules!" he growled. "I don't ask for a lot. I let her go out. I trust her, and I trusted you. But we had an agreement. I made plans. You all ruined them. On her fucking birthday! You know what birthdays mean to us. And you went and fucking ruined it!" 

 "We didn't did we?" Sheri asked. "Not completely ruined. Please, say we didn't. I couldn't stand that." 

 He finished that last couple of blows. "No. Not completely. But I'm not happy. Is that understood? Never again. You don't want her to have to find new friends do you? Hell, I'm just now getting used to you girls. Sure as shit don't want to have to break in a new set. Best friends don't do what you guys did." 

 Dana was crying like it was the end of the world. 

 "You done now? Please? Don't hurt her. We're sorry." Sheri asked nervously, when no more blows fell. 

 "Halfway. Our guest for the night has to do his part." 

 "Derek?" 

 Dana sat up, all crying abruptly stopped. She waved her hand imperiously for the phone. Gary turned it over to her, and she took it, taking it off speaker phone and talking softly as she wandered away. She stopped in front of the full-length mirror by the door, turning and observing her red butt. Then we lost her in the kitchen. 

 "Too harsh?" he asked. 

 "Not at all. I think that was masterful. I'm pretty sure they got the message. All of them." 

 "Don't be too hard on her, Ok? I wasn't. Not really. Don't know what all that screaming and whining was about." 

 "For her friends. Showing off. Big strong hubby putting her in her place. Trying to make them jealous." 

 "You think?" 

 "I'd bet on it." 

 "Beer?" he asked. 

 I debated it. "Last one." 

 He nodded. "Me too. Take the edge off a little, you know? But not enough to interfere with business." 

 I asked him where the bathroom was, and he pointed the way. When I returned, he was back with the beer, and Dana was waiting patiently. She'd cleaned up her face. "Your turn," she said to me, lying over my lap. 

 "Turn over." 

 She looked at me nervously, then rolled over onto her back. 

 "I think your very forgiving husband took care of those rosy cheeks. I wouldn't want you miserable for the rest of the night." 

 She smiled. "Thanks." She grinned at her husband. "Can I pick'em or what? Counting my spanks, takin' care of me." 

 "You did good, sweetie." 

 I slapped her tit, and she squealed. "Ow!" 

 "Twenty-seven to go, beautiful." 

 The first one was for shock value. I wasn't rough at all, with the first dozen just firm enough to sting and pink her up a little. Two more sharper ones, had her squirming. "Fourteen, halfway there." 

 She nodded silently. 

 "Spread your legs." 

 She whimpered, opening them. "Not too hard..." 

 "Wider." 

 She opened herself obscenely wide, and I slapped her hard on her pussy, making her jump and cry out. 

 "Please, Jack!" 

 "You'll remember next time, won't you?" I said, smacking her a second time, just as hard. 

 "YES!" she shrieked. "I'll remember. I will." 

 I leaned over and kissed her lips. "Good. I'm not going to hurt you. Last thing I want is for that gorgeous pussy of yours to be worn out before we start." 

 "Promise?" she asked nervously, her eyes tearing up. 

 "Cross my heart and hope to die." 

 I swatted her firmly, enough to feel it without hurting. Then I rubbed her pussy, teasing her. Another spank and more rubbing. Lots more. By the time I reached the last one, she was writhing out of control, and Gary was holding her legs, while I held her body down. 

 "One more," I teased. "Hard or soft." 

 "Hard damn you. Hard and then you have to fuck the shit out of it!" 

 I smacked her quite hard, making her whole body jerk, then rubbed her incessantly, grinding the palm of my hand down on her clit. 

 "F...Fuck me, damn it, FUCK ME!" 

 I laughed, bringing her closer, feeling her hips thrusting upward, then backing off. When her breathing settled I started again. 

 "Stop teasin' me, damn you Jack!" 

 I laughed, leaning over her face. I brushed my lips across hers. "God, I'm going to love sharing you." 

 "Please? Lemme come, I gotta come." 

 I smacked her pussy soundly, surprising her. She moaned, and I pulled my hand away. "Time to move to the bedroom?" 

 She turned to her husband, "Make him, baby. Make him finish me." 

 He just laughed at her. "You chose him, remember?" 

 She pouted, turning back to me. "You...you're not going to leave me hangin'?" 

 "No, I'll take care of you. We both will, all night long. Now why don't you go to the bathroom and prepare yourself for us, beautiful." 

 "God, you're a meanie! I'm gonna get you for this." 

 "Yes you are. You're going to get me, and get me, and get me..." 

 "Fuck, you have me worked up. You always torture your women this way?" 

 "No, this is the Dana special. Nobody else deserves it. You're the best, remember? And it's your birthday. We're pulling out all the stops." 

 She pulled my head down and kissed me passionately, hungrily. "You know how bad I want you right now?" she whispered. 

 "Oh yeah. And then some. Go. Hurry, or I'll drag you out of that bathroom and use you like you were meant to be." 

 "Promise?" she said grinning. 

 "Go!" 

 ========================== 

 I know, the first chapter is quite the tease. The second chapter, I promise is the complete payoff. I hope you enjoy both.  

 

 ****** He Looked Like Me Ch.02 ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© ===================== 

 Her birthday present is unwrapped. 

 Final chapter of a simple little story about a good deed, and the ample rewards. It's Dana's birthday, and she gets celebrated. 

 ===================== 

 I watched the birthday girl wander down the hall to get ready for us. To be honest, I was still pinching myself. I couldn't believe my luck. I got to be her birthday present. Damn! 

 Her husband and I went to the bedroom, and I could see Gary was getting a little nervous. I decided it would be good to calm him, if at all possible. 

 "You guys ever done something like this before?" I asked. 

 He shook his head. "No. First time. You?" 

 "Me neither. Listen Gary. I don't want to cause any trouble. If I do anything you don't like, anything that makes you uncomfortable, call me on it. If you need me to stop or even leave, you just say the word, Ok?" 

 He nodded, then smiled. "That's not really gonna work." 

 "Why?" 

 "Gotta be honest man. The whole thing makes me uncomfortable. I... I would never share her, but she really wants it. I figure I'll just have to deal. It's her birthday." 

 "I know. I get it. Birthday's a big deal for you two." 

 "You have no idea. Our birthday's are special. It's when we met. When we got engaged. Our first time. She's the best thing that ever happened to me, and I'm going to do whatever I have to, one time a year, to make that day everything she could ask for." He grinned. "I shouldn't really complain, she's always found a way to make my birthday incredible. I mean, seriously amazing." 

 He started undressing, and I kicked off my shoes. "I'm jealous. Wish I had what you two have. I was close once, but fucked it up. I guess we both fucked it up. She got stupid drunk, and chose bad friends. I couldn't forgive, or take the humiliation. Wish things had worked out differently." 

 "Sorry to hear that. Believe me, I know I got it good. She's the best." He was pulling his pants off, and looked at me still dressed. "You gonna get undressed?" 

 "I figure she can undress me if she wants." I thought of something, and pulled out my wallet. "I... I want you to know I'm clean. Got tested after my last relationship, and that was over two months ago." I handed him my STD free card. "I'll use a condom..." 

 He examined the card. "You carry something like this around?" 

 I nodded. "Lotta single people do. Sex isn't worth risking your life over. If my partner doesn't have one, it's a no go." 

 He handed it back. "You trust us, if I tell you we're clean? Never been with anybody else?" 

 "I think that's pretty obvious by now. Yeah, I trust you." 

 "Good." He grinned. "How you wanna do this, then?" 

 I put my hands up in surrender. "Up to you guys. I'm happy to be a guest, but I'll let you two drive this ship." 

 "Wanna help me with the bed?" he asked, pulling the covers off. 

 "Sure. What do you need?" 

 He walked into the closet and came out with a blanket and another fitted sheet. "We put these down. When she's having a really good time, she leaks a lot." 

 We spread the blanket out, and covered it with the fitted sheet. Just in time. His stunning wife walked out, naked except for her heels. Her hair was pulled back in a pony tail, her makeup exquisite. I don't know if I'd ever seen anything more beautiful in my life. 

 "My boys ready for me?" she purred, leaning against the door-jamb. 

 "You fuckin' lucky ass son-of-a-bitch. That's yours?" I turned and asked Gary. 

 "All mine. And as of now, she's yours too." 

 "Damn. Feels like it's my birthday." I turned to face Dana. "You're gorgeous, birthday girl." 

 She grinned, then walked over to me pouting. "Why's my present still wrapped?" 

 "You want someone else to unwrap your present?" I asked. 

 Her grin grew even bigger. "No! It's mine. I should get to unwrap it, right?" 

 "Of course," I said. 

 She turned and smiled at her husband. "He's a good birthday present, isn't he?" 

 Gary nodded. "You chose well, baby." 

 "God gave him to me. Found him and gave him to me on my birthday. Gave me Jack. My Jack." 

 "All yours, gorgeous," I said softly, as she peeled my shirt away. 

 "Mine," she whispered, dropping to her knees, and unbuckling my belt. My knees were shaking a bit as she opened my pants, unzipped them, and pulled them down. I stepped out of them, standing in front of her, achingly hard inside my boxers. 

 "Is it a big surprise?" she asked, rubbing my shaft through the cloth. 

 "I guess that's your call," I said. "It isn't small." 

 "Can I open it?" 

 "It's yours, baby girl. All yours." 

 She turned her head and leaned her cheek against it. "I... I wanna wait a li'l longer. I need to take care of my wunnerful hubby first, Ok?" 

 "Whatever you want's Ok," I assured her, stroking her soft hair. 

 She stood, wobbling for a second, then grabbed my cock through my shorts, tugging. "This way, Jack. My Jack. I want you to see. See how perfect my man is. He knows me, knows how to make me crazy. You hafta see!" 

 I chuckled. "You're determined to drive me crazy, aren't you?" 

 She had climbed on the bed, on her knees, and was still pulling me along, until I sat beside her. "I get to drive you a li'l crazy, and then you and hubby get to do same for me. Go crazy on me." 

 She leaned in for a quick peck, but I stopped her. I pulled her face close, and kissed her thoroughly, until she responded, moaning. "Thank you for choosing me, Dana. It's not even my birthday, and this is without a doubt the best gift anyone's ever given me. Thank you." 

 She grinned, and then her smile turned upside down. "This is the best? We haven't even done anything." 

 "If I walked out the door now, it would still be the best present I ever got." 

 She pouted cutely. "That's sad. I don' wanna be sad, Jack. Tell me that's not true." 

 "You should never be sad. Of course it's not true. It's still a great gift." 

 She looked at me intently. "But it is true, isn't it?" 

 I hugged her, feeling my eyes moisten. "No. Of course not. I want you to be happy. You deserve the bestest birthday in the world, Dana. Be happy for me. That would be the nicest gift of all." 

 She pulled away, and I saw a glisten in her eye. "Better than this?" she asked, waving her hands down her impeccable body. 

 "Ok, you caught me. Nothing would be better than that." 

 She leaned in and kissed me softly. "Watch me, Jack. Watch me love my hubby. Best hubby in the world." 

 She crawled on top of his prone body, arms and legs straddling him. Her face was over his. "Thank you for my birthday, honey. For letting me go out with my friends. For forgiving me when I was bad, late coming home, forgetting my panties. For trusting me." She leaned down and kissed him softly. "Thank you for letting me have Jack." She kissed him again, longer, then slowly moved down his body, kissing her way along, until she was between his legs. She started kissing all around his cock, little licks and kisses, rubbing her face against it. It was like catnip, and she was the world's cutest kitty, purring as she adored his cock. 

 He was hard already, no surprise there. I felt good about it. I had been a little nervous. What if he had been tiny? I'd have felt guilty as shit. Or what if he had been huge? Talk about inadequate. How much would I have brought to the table? 

 Luckily he was average. Probably a good six inches. I had nothing to feel bad about. 

 I'm a guy. I'll admit it. Can't help it, you know. Cock size is something we all have to deal with. In this case, I was confident I was a bit larger, longer and thicker. Not some 10" freak, but a solid seven+. Maybe a little more tonight. I couldn't remember ever having been more excited. I'd pull my own weight tonight. 

 She was sucking him, loving that cock, like it was the end-all, be-all, meaning of her world. I laid down next to Gary, our heads only a foot or so apart. 

 "God, it would be so easy to hate you, right now," I teased. 

 He smiled. "I know, dude. I can't believe it myself sometimes. I'm so not worthy. But then I realize, Hell, nobody is, and I'm good for her." 

 She pulled her head up, grinning. "Best. Hubby. Ever." She gave him a long slow suck. "Talk about me. I like that." Then her mouth was too full to talk. 

 "She do that for you often?" I asked. 

 "All the time. She's amazing." 

 "Bastard. You gotta stop telling me these things. Lie to me, Ok? You get that every day?" 

 "Few times a week. At least once a month, she'll meet me at the door, naked on her knees, when I come home from work. Won't let me in until I pay her toll." 

 "Why? Why would you tell me something like that? I'll never walk into my house again, without thinkin' what I'm missing." 

 "Shit. You're a good guy. You'll get your own Dana someday. Don't settle." 

 I laughed. "No matter what, after seeing this, anything I could ever get would be settling." I watched her showing off for us. "She doesn't blow you, she makes love to your cock. It's pretty incredible." 

 I could see she was getting to him, and he was finding it harder to talk. He didn't answer for a few seconds. "The best. She's the best." 

 She pulled up, her hand stroking him. "My mouth? Or you want to fuck me?" 

 "Finish me, then I want you to do him just as good. Show him what you can do." 

 She nodded, then took him in her mouth again. She was moving her head rapidly, working him. 

 "I can't believe you can last that long. With that? I'll be lucky to go more than a minute or two. No man can withstand that." 

 Gary grinned. "I get lots of practice." 

 "Fucker. Reminding me again. You ever hear of noblesse oblige? Fuckin' royalty supposed to treat us commoners nicely. Not 'cause we deserve it, but because you can. Don't rub it in." 

 "Soon," he groaned. 

 I matched his groan, when she pushed down and took him in her throat, his entire cock disappearing. He grunted, gasping her name. 

 "Sweet Jesus, that's amazing. Beautiful, sexy and talented. Fuckin' trifecta," I mumbled. 

 She was pounding him down her throat, and I saw his hips lifting, driving against her. He reached down for her head, holding her, when he cried out. She took him gamely, looking up at us both for just a second, her eyes landing on him, then glancing over at me, before looking down again. She sucked him dry, until he was breathing normally. She got up on her knees, and showed us her empty mouth. "Every drop, honey. Thank you for my birthday present." 

 "You're the best, baby." 

 She grinned, climbing up his body, and kissing him. "And all yours. Tell me to send him away, and I will. I don't need anybody but you. If you don't want me to do this, I understand." 

 "You want him, don't you?" 

 She nodded shyly. "But I don't have to. You spoil me. I don't want to upset you. If this bothers you at all, please tell me. I never want to hurt you." 

 Of course you can imagine the response I was praying ardently for. 

 "Suck him, baby. Suck his cock. I want to see it. If I can't stand it, I'll let you know, Ok?" 

 She nodded, laying on top of him, hugging him, kissing his face a hundred times. "Thank you, thank you, thank you. I promise. Never gonna regret it. You spoil me, and you know how much I'm gonna spoil you." 

 "I know." 

 She kissed him deeply, then reached over and pushed me flat on my back. "Your turn, handsome Jack. You liked my show?" 

 "Incredible." 

 "Even better when it happens to you. Tell me you want me." She climbed off of her husband, and over top of me. 

 "Never wanted anything as much in my life." 

 "You want my naughty mouth?" 

 "I'm dying for it. Never, ever saw anything like that. You're amazing." 

 She grinned. "I'm gonna start now. Talk to me. Tell me what you like. How it feels. I wanna hear it." 

 She pressed her lips to mine, softly, her tongue brushing my lips, then her lips started downward, leaving a trail of burning kisses down my body. 

 "Tell me, or I stop," she warned. 

 "Don't stop. Please, God, don't stop, Dana. Each of those little kisses burn right to my soul. Everywhere your lips land, it's like shocks to my nervous system. I've had women give me their all, and it didn't even start to compare to...," I groaned as she sucked my nipple. "Damn it, girl! How am I supposed to - FUCK!" I gasped, as she tugged on the other one. "- talk when you're doing that?" 

 She giggled, her lips slowly inching their way downward, her wicked tongue drawing patterns on my skin. 

 "Such a naughty tongue," I whispered. "How the fuck can you make me burn like this?" 

 She took my skin between her teeth nipping me. I twitched, and she put her hands on my sides, holding me still. She reached my belly-button, and her tongue teased the edges, before pushing inward. 

 "So incredibly beautiful. Can you even understand, Dana? What it's like for a guy like me to see someone as gorgeous as you doing that. To feel you? Feel those lips against my flesh? Do you get it? It's like I won the lottery, only better. All the money in the world couldn't buy you." 

 She looked up at me, those big blue eyes promising miracles. She stopped, rising up on her arms. "No Jack. I don't understand. But I know this much. A guy like you? Only guys like you and my hubby deserve this. Deserve me. You do. I know it. You're one of the good ones. You deserve everything I'm gonna give you, and so much more. So don't think you don't deserve me." 

 I grinned for her. "Dana, angel, there's not a man alive who deserves you. Tell me otherwise, and I'll tan that incredible ass of yours. I don't deserve you, but I sure as hell am gonna enjoy you anyway. Give me a chance, and I'm gonna make sure this is one birthday you're never gonna forget." 

 "Promise?" 

 "Cross my heart." 

 "Good. I'm gonna suck your spine out your cock now." She grabbed my boxers, and pulled them down roughly, yanking them down my legs, then tossing them to the side theatrically. She squinted, and grinned. "Nice present. Super nice. Just like my hubby's. I'm sooo gonna enjoy this." 

 I got the same lovin' treatment her husband had received. She looked up at me. "Talk to me." 

 "Please. I can't. It's too much. I can barely think." 

 She giggled, then looked over at her husband. "You talk to me. You asked me to do this. To suck him. Tell me." 

 He smiled for her. "Incredible. It's... it's difficult. You look so beautiful, so damn sexy. I can't help but be a little jealous. That mouth. It's supposed to be mine, all mine. And it's going to be sucking that big cock in a second, isn't it?" 

 She nodded, and I saw the glimmer of joy in her eye. 

 "He's bigger, isn't he? Does that excite you?" 

 She looked up, and licked my shaft slowly from balls to crown. "Only a li'l bigger, honey. Hardly at all. Just a couple of inches." 

 "Does it? Does it excite you?" 

 She nodded shyly. "A little." 

 "You think it will feel different?" he asked. 

 She ran her tongue around the head, blowing across the top of it. "I don't know. Maybe." 

 "You hope so, don't you. You want it." 

 She looked up at me, and took me in her mouth. She lowered her head slowly, and I groaned. She pulled off, sucking hard, making a little popping noise as she released me. "I want it. I wanna feel this big fat cock stretching me. Is that bad?" 

 "You want to be our dirty little slut tonight, don't you?" 

 She blushed. "I'm always your slut." 

 "No. Tonight you're gonna be our slut. We're gonna use you. Use you hard. Spit roast you, fill your pussy and ass, stretch you out. Wear you down. You're gonna be our dirty little cum-slut." 

 "Anything. Everything. Use me," she gasped, before going down on me for real. 

 Gary stood, climbing off the bed. He climbed behind her, lifting her hips nice and high. He tugged her backward so her ass was hanging off the bed. I scooted down so she wouldn't have to stop what she was doing. 

 "I'm gonna fuck this dirty little pussy. Fuck you while you're sucking another man's cock. You're such a little slut. Had to have another cock, didn't you?" 

 She whimpered, her mouth full, and moaned as he entered her. 

 "Fuck this red, swollen cunt. Bet you had a bunch of strange cocks up in here last night, didn't you, slut?" 

 She pulled off of me, whining. "No honey. Never. Only you. Since our very first date, it's only been you." 

 "You wanted it though, didn't you? Teasing all those men." 

 She shook her head, pushing back against him. "Never. I like teasing, but don't want 'em. Never wanted anybody but my hubby." 

 "Your hubby and Jack. You just had to have Jack, didn't you, slut?" 

 She looked up at me. "My fantasy. He's just like you. It's like getting you twice." 

 "You didn't want Derek?" 

 "No. Nothing like you. I was gonna do it, 'cause you wanted. I'll do anything for you. Even that creep." 

 Her sucking had gone to hell. She was holding me, her head resting on my belly, while her husband fucked her. 

 "You should have told me. I thought you liked him. You said you wanted another man for your birthday." 

 She sighed. "Two of you. I told you. He's Ok. Not my fantasy." 

 "And Jack is?" 

 She looked up at me and grinned. "Oh yeah. Big time." 

 "Then why the hell aren't you sucking his cock, slut?" He smacked her ass loudly, and she went back to blowing me. 

 He slowed down, stroking her slowly, and she concentrated on my cock. "God," I groaned. "So damn good. Such a perfect little slut-wife." 

 I saw Gary grin when I said that. "Our perfect slut. She wants to be a slut. She'll get to be. We're gonna fuck the shit out of her." 

 "Take it all, Dana. Show me you can do it," I told her, stroking her hair. 

 She whimpered softly, then pushed hard. I felt my cock sliding into her tight throat. "Fuck!" I moaned. 

 "All of it?" Gary asked. "She took all of it?" 

 "Every bit," I gasped, as she proved she could do it again, and again. 

 "Amazing, huh?" he said, grinning. 

 "Fuckin' incredible. Perfect slut." 

 He started fucking her harder, and her form got sloppy as her body bounced around. She pulled up, her hand stroking me rapidly. "Come for me, Jack. Give me a big load. Make me swallow your cum." 

 I reached out and pushed her head down my cock, firmly, making her take me down her throat. She made the nastiest little gagging noises, pulling back after a few seconds, gasping, then taking me again. Incredible. 

 "Gonna come for you," I groaned. 

 "Paint her tonsils, man. Gag her." 

 I pulled her head down, until her nose was pressed against my belly. I held her there, feeling her movement as her husband fucked her roughly. She looked up at me, her hands curled up, just over my hips. It looked like she wanted to push off, but was holding back, resisting. Her eyes were pleading, and I saw them start to roll upward. I released her, and she pulled off, gasping loudly. 

 She looked at me, and I thought I saw a little fear. "Again?" she asked. 

 I nodded. 

 She did it on her own. All the way. Held me there, the rocking of her body, transmitted through her with each stroke her husband gave her. She watched me, refusing to give up. Her eyelids started trembling, her face turning red. I couldn't believe how long she could take it. Her hands were clenched in fists, her knuckles white. I grabbed her hair, and pulled her off roughly. She took a huge breath, a string of saliva hanging from her lips. 

 "Close," I moaned. "One more." 

 She nodded, and slammed her head down roughly. This time she didn't stop. She bobbed her head on the last couple of inches, keeping me in her throat. Each movement had me entering her throat again, a little hitch in the action, like popping the head of my cock through a tight ring. The nasty noises started, a sort of 'guh, guh, guh', driving me crazy. 

 "Fuck!" I cried out, when I couldn't hold back a second longer, erupting powerfully. The first shot went straight down her throat, then she pulled back, her nostrils flaring, as I finished inside that incredible mouth.  

 

 ****** He Looked Like Me Ch.02 ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© She sucked me dry, just as she'd promised in the store, only a few hours earlier. She closed her eyes, smiling, resting her head on my hip, while her husband fucked her. 

 "She did it?" he asked. 

 I nodded. "Best ever." 

 The little smile on her face, grew immensely. 

 "Show me," her husband demanded. 

 She crawled away from him, turning around, laying perpendicular to me, her head over my belly. She tilted her head upward. I could see she was opening her mouth. 

 "Swallow it," he said. 

 She turned to show me her frothy white mouth, then closed it, turning back to her husband. 

 "You liked that, didn't you?" he growled, standing there stroking his cock. 

 "I loved it. All of it," she said proudly. "My first DP." 

 "Get him hard. He's going to fuck you now." 

 She leaned down and licked my cock. "You sure? This is your last chance to stop it. It's still not too late. Once he fucks me, I'm not letting him leave until you guys wear me out." 

 "Suck him, slut." 

 She turned on the bed, until her legs were straddling my head. I didn't need any more invitation than that, and started licking her swollen, red pussy. I felt her mouth sink over my cock. 

 No doubt about it. I was the second luckiest man. 

 I'm not saying I'm an expert or anything. But I've been told, more than once, I was good at eating pussy. Very good. I'd always been very open to direction when it came to that, and took my lessons to heart. Truth is, most of the time I loved it. There were a few women who didn't really do it for me, but I soldiered on. That wasn't the case here. I wanted to own that pretty little pussy before I was done. 

 I think I did a fair job of it. I made her come for me after only a few minutes, then wrangled another big one out of her, getting her to yell out. Yeah, I was feeling proud. 

 I felt a little weird as Gary climbed up beside my head. I'll give him credit, he wasn't an ass about it. "You mind?" he asked, halfway to straddling my head. 

 I kind of did, but that was hardly fair. Shit, he was sharing a goddess with me. "Kind of weird for me, but go ahead," I said. 

 I lowered my head, and got a close up view of his dick entering her. I concentrated on the feeling at my crotch, while he fucked her. 

 She had done her job, restoring my erection to its full glory. I was ready. Now I wanted what he was getting. I loved her mouth, but I needed that pussy. Fuck, did I need it. 

 I still had to wait a couple of minutes until he was done for the moment. He pulled off of her, and before I knew it, she had spun around, and was poised over my cock. "You want me?" she asked teasingly. 

 "Fuck me." 

 "Ask me nicely, and I might," she teased, coyly. 

 "Fuck me. Fuck me now. Fuck me hard, you teasing little slut, or I'm going to throw you down on your marital bed, and fuck the living shit out of you." 

 She grinned, and lowered herself onto my cock. "Anyone tell you, you have the nicest way with words, Jack, sweetie?" 

 Indescribable. Impossible for me to do it justice. Best fucking feeling of my life, entering her, seeing that gorgeous woman straddling me. She was still wearing that silly grin. 

 "I think you like me, Jack." 

 "Gary, do me a favor? Stick something in her mouth." 

 He laughed, standing on the bed beside her, and pulling her face onto his cock. "What you wanted, right baby? Two at once. How's the fat cock feel, stretching out my pussy?" He pulled her off his dick, waiting. 

 "Huge. Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you, honey." 

 "You know how to thank me." He pulled her face back onto his cock. 

 She was rocking, and moving up and down, but couldn't get much leverage. It was great, keeping me hard, letting me feel all of that tight little pussy, while doing very little to get me off. I felt wonderful, like I could go on forever. 

 Eventually he pulled away. "Enough. I don't want to come yet." 

 She put her hands on my chest, and started fucking me harder. "You like my pussy," she asked, breathing hard. 

 "Perfect, like everything about you." 

 "Tight?" 

 "What do you think?" 

 She grinned. "Perfect's a good word." 

 She slid her hands up toward my head, lowering her body. Gave me a chance to get at those tits. Hard little nipples felt so damn good in my mouth. Sucking and tugging, taking turns, seeing how much of those tits I could fit in my mouth. She moaned, and I grabbed her hips, lifting her a little, and pounding up into her as hard as I could. 

 She lowered her body, her head beside mine, as she started trembling. A sweet litany of squeaky moans escaped her lips. "Gonna come for me, gorgeous?" 

 She whimpered, gasping. "N...N...Now. Coming." 

 I hadn't noticed Gary standing beside the bed, watching. I saw he had a camera out filming. "You've got her. She's coming now. Coming hard. It's a good one." 

 She wasn't crying out or screaming, nothing like that. Just an adorable, sexy series of grunting moans, her entire body trembling. 

 It felt too good. I was getting close, and damn if I was going to come already. 

 I looked up at Gary. "Fuck her for me? I need a break." 

 He grinned, climbing on the bed. He lifted her hips up nice and high, and I pulled my legs together so he could straddle them. He started fucking her, while I held her upper body down, kissing her cheek, her neck. She seemed to have calmed a bit, and her face turned to mine, our lips meeting. "Fuck, that was intense," she whispered. 

 "Good?" 

 "Amazing. You gonna fuck me some more?" she whispered, her body shifting as her husband ploughed her from behind. 

 "Needed a break. Didn't want to come yet." 

 "I want you to come. Fill my slutty married pussy, Jack." Her words were soft as satin, meant only for me. 

 "Dirty girl," I teased. 

 "Dirty pussy. Fill it. Fill it for my hubby." 

 "For...for him?" 

 "Yeah. Make him clean me. You'd like that? Make my husband clean my pussy out." 

 "I... I don't know." 

 She kissed me softly. "He wants to, sweetie. It'll embarrass him, but he really wants to." 

 "I'm gonna fuck you for real now," I told her. 

 "Mmmm. I can't wait." She lifted up on her arms, and reached back, stopping Gary. "Need to move," she explained. 

 She turned and took me in her mouth again. It was only a few seconds before I was ready to go. I pulled her mouth off of me, got up and put her on her back. She looked eager, spreading her legs. I climbed between them, and entered her. Fucking amazing. I leaned over her, her legs sticking out to the side, shaking with each thrust, as I started in, hammering her. She stared at me, her eyes adoring, her hands reaching out, touching me all over, gliding across my skin, reaching for my hips, pulling me into her. 

 I sat up for a second, reaching around her legs, and pressing them backward, tilting her pussy upward. Fucking Gary was walking around with his camera, getting a close up of her face, filming my cock entering her. I was over her, legs pressed back, pounding straight down into her. 

 "Open your legs, Jack. Let me get a shot of this," he said. 

 Fuck. A director. Still, it was his pussy. I opened my legs, and long stroked her, giving him a great shot. 

 She really liked that, and I saw the look. Eyes closed, the little squeaking moans. Upper body trembling, legs shaking. 

 "She's coming," I announced. 

 "God, that's sweet. Fuck her, dude. Pound her. Break that pussy." 

 I lowered my body, kissing her. Her eyes flickered open, then she was grabbing me, clutching me tightly, her mouth sucking against mine desperately. My hips were still driving into her, relentless, and I could feel her little orgasms as they rolled through her. 

 "Big one," I whispered in her ear. "I want a big one." 

 "F...fast. Hard and fast," she whispered. 

 I lifted up, my hands holding her upper arms, pinning her to the bed. I adjusted my position, getting my knees in place, then drove into her. Jackhammered her through the mattress. Her eyes burst open, mouth gaping. "Oh!" she gasped loudly. 

 "Best. Fucking. Pussy," I growled, working hard to give her what she needed. 

 "That's it," Gary groaned. He had one hand on his cock, whacking away almost violently, as he brought the camera in close to her face. 

 "Perfect. Slut," I whispered. She was whimpering, her hand reaching out for me, grabbing, squeezing. Her body arched underneath me, trembling beautifully. 

 "Come, you little slut," I demanded. "Come on my fat cock." 

 I felt it start. She snapped, her hands reaching out, grabbing the sheets, her fists clenching. She threw her head back, crying out, shrieking as a huge orgasm took her. So God damn beautiful, and for the moment mine. All mine. 

 "You got her, man. Fucking huge come." Gary scrambled up the bed, leaning over her face, brushing her hair back. "Come, baby," he whispered to her. 

 She gasped, her body collapsing into the bed for a few seconds. Then she was tensing up again. "Oh God! Oh GOD!" and I got another one. I released her arms, and put my hands on her head, turning her to face me, her eyes searching. 

 "Gonna come for you," I told her. 

 She whimpered, as I paused for a moment, catching my breath, then pounded her with long full strokes, driving her into the mattress. 

 "Come, baby. Come for me Jack," she begged, her hips thrusting against me. "Come, come, come." 

 I couldn't hold back a moment longer. Unintelligible sounds burst from my lips as I slammed downward, exploding inside her. She came with me, not the huge earth-shaking one of earlier, but it was beautiful. I came so hard, I swear I was going to lose a kidney inside of her. When I was done, I felt Gary pushing me to the side. I pulled off of her, and watched him open her legs, his camera in hand, getting a close up of her well-used pussy. I saw her smile, eyes half- lidded. She reached down and spread herself open, and I heard Gary's moan. 

 He was touching her, sliding his finger inside of her, rubbing my juices all over. Her hand was on my arm, tugging. I moved toward her, and she opened her mouth, pulling at my hips. I got the message, and presented my sticky cock to her. She sucked me, licking, teasing. Even when I was clean, she kept sucking away, at my half-hard cock. She moaned around my cock, and I looked down to see her husband's face between her legs, his eyes closed. 

 She looked up at me, then motioned me downward with a crooked finger. I laid beside her, and she turned her face toward me, reaching for my head, pulling me close. She kissed me, tenderly. "Perfect," she whispered. She glanced down between her open legs. "Don't say anything, Ok?" 

 "'Course not." 

 She grinned. "I want you in my ass. Will you do that for me?" 

 I chuckled. "I'd love to do that for you." 

 "After," she whispered. "I'm gonna do him next, Ok?" 

 "Whatever you need, Dana. It's your birthday." 

 Her smile lit up the room. "I know. Best ever. Thank you." 

 She kissed me softly. "Give us a moment? Get a drink or something." 

 I kissed her back, then got up and found my way to their kitchen. Snagged some OJ, and downed it, then followed that up with a tall glass of water. I relaxed, telling myself I'd give them 10 minutes. I looked around, took in their pictures, a big wedding picture in the dining room, some vacation snapshots. Another wedding picture, of her and six other women. I imagine I was looking at most of the crowd that got her in trouble. A good looking group, but no doubt she was the hottest. She was stunning in all of the pictures. Ridiculously photogenic, a smile made for the camera. And mine for a night. I filled two big glasses with water, and made my way back to the bedroom. 

 He was still between her legs, and she beckoned me over. "Still?" I asked softly, offering her the water. 

 "Pillows," she said, raising her body, and I put a couple of pillows behind her. Gary didn't slow down for a moment. She took the water, drank half of it, and passed it back to me. I put it on the bed-stand and laid down beside her. She winked at me. "Again," she whispered. "He had his turn." 

 She reached up and brushed my hair back. "You Ok with everything?" 

 "I'm in heaven." 

 I loved her smile. "Can you get hard for me again?" 

 "No doubt." 

 "Then what are you waiting for? Come up here and fuck my face." 

 A few minutes back in her mouth, and I was ready for more. 

 "Can you turn a little? Pull your leg back?" Gary asked. 

 Gary and his camera. I pulled my leg back, turning my hips, and eased my cock in and out of his wife's face. 

 "Look at me baby," he said. "Suck that fat cock, and look at me." 

 She gave him what he wanted, putting on a show. The position was wrong for her to take all of me, but I got an inch or so into her throat. I found that if I lifted a little higher, my cock pointing downward more, she could take more of it. 

 "There! Hold it there," he said, with her nose pressed against my pubes. 

 I gave him 10 seconds or so, then pulled out, leaving her gasping. 

 I backed away, and he followed with the camera. "What are you gonna do to her?" 

 "Doggy, then I'm gonna take that sweet ass of hers." 

 She rolled over for me, lifting her hips, and I settled in behind her. Fucking perfect ass, full cheeks, alabaster skin. Beautiful curves from her hips to her narrow waist. I couldn't resist tasting her again, nibbling her ass cheeks. 

 "See, Gary? Nothing wrong with a little dirty pussy," she told her husband. "He don't mind, either. I got me the best men in the world." 

 She wasn't dirty far as I could tell. Seemed hubby took care of her pretty well. I hadn't even thought of that, to be honest. She just looked so damned good, I had to have a taste. 

 I rose up and eased into her, taking my time. Enjoying every moment of the sweet penetration. Grabbed her ass cheeks and spread them. God it looked good. 

 Gary tapped my hip, and I opened them toward him, so he could film my cock entering his wife. Long strokes, pulling all the way out, so I could penetrate her over and over again. He reached out and pushed her shoulders to the bed, then pulled back for the big view. 

 I turned to face him. "Lube." 

 He set the camera down on the dresser, tinkering with the view, then went to the bed-stand, returning with a bottle. He opened it, and tilted it up over her ass, dribbling it down her crack. I fucked her slowly, while I used my finger to tease her ass, slowly opening it. He held the bottle over my finger, pouring out some more, which I pushed inside of her. He looked back at the camera, then got up and went to the other side of us. He grabbed her cheeks and spread them open, while I inserted a second finger inside of her, getting a nice little moan for a response. 

 "You sure, baby? He's pretty big." Gary leaned over her, talking softly. 

 "I need it, honey," she said. 

 He was stroking his cock, watching me. Limp noodle in his hand. He didn't say a word. 

 I pulled my cock out of her delicious pussy, and my fingers out of her butt. I felt her tremble as I pressed the head of my cock at her little brown star. Gary leaned in and squirted lube on my cock, surprising me again when he grabbed it, stroking it, then pointed it at her ass. 

 "Put it in her," I told him. 

 He glanced up at me, then squeezed my shaft, putting the head against her hole. I leaned forward, and he fed me into her ass. She grunted as I entered her, pulling away for a moment, until I popped out. Gary reached around her waist, holding her, and steered me back inside of her. She groaned, as I popped inside. 

 He let go of my cock, and almost ran to get his camera, as I took my time working my way inside. "You alright?" I asked. 

 "Fucking huge," she gasped. "Fuck me." 

 Gary was getting more intrusive by the moment. He added some more lube to my cock, then I lost the view as he stuck the camera almost between us. 

 "Christ!" he moaned. "Look at her stretch to take you." 

 Like I could, with that damn camera in the way. I pulled out, then sank back in. Longer strokes, which she seemed to be handling well. He backed off, getting the wide view, then moved down to film her face. She was talking to him, but I couldn't hear what she was saying. I got the gist when he crawled underneath her, scooting down the bed. His face appeared below me, gazing up at my cock, then he was licking her, raising his head awkwardly. 

 I figured I'd help him out, and pushed her legs outward, lowering her until she was settled over his mouth. I leaned over her, and started thrusting harder. 

 "Still alright?" I asked. 

 She pulled her mouth off of his cock. "Fuck me, Jack. I can take it. Fuck my ass like you mean it." 

 Fine. No more mister nice guy. I pounded my cock into her ass, making her grunt. Again, and again, I pummeled her tight ass. Grabbed her shoulders and pulled her back against me. Took her pony tail in hand, and yanked back hard, lifting her head upward, making her moan and shake, while I fucked her backdoor. She seemed to get off on that, and I smacked her ass cheek. 

 "Fuck!" she groaned. "Smack my slutty ass, Jack!" 

 I spanked her. Repeatedly, and was rewarded with a pretty little orgasm. I almost laughed, when Gary's hand appeared above her, holding the camera, waving it. 

 I took it from him, and filmed her red cheeks, my cock splitting her open. A few minutes of that, and suddenly she was pulling away from me. 

 "Lay down for me," she said, patting the pillows above her head. 

 I leaned back against the pillows, and she squatted, facing away from me. Lifted one leg, rose up and took me back in her ass. She leaned backward, resting against my chest. "How's that?" she asked her husband. 

 He knelt in front of us, filming my cock in her butt, stroking his own which seemed to be coming back to life. "Perfect." 

 I held her legs in my hands, driving my cock into her. She felt amazing. She turned her face to me, smiling. "God, you're everything I fantasized about. This is all so perfect," she whispered, before kissing me. She turned back around. "Now, baby. I need my hubby now." 

 He shuffled forward on his knees, and slid his cock inside of her. He grinned at me sheepishly. "Big fantasy of hers. Fucked by two big cocks. Double teamed, front and back." 

 Dana groaned, and started bouncing on my cock, while her husband filled her pussy. He was going at it hard, pounding into her. I could feel each stroke, shaking her body. I reached around her, playing with her tits, tugging her nipples, while we filled her. 

 I couldn't tell if she was enjoying it, or we were hurting her. She was groaning, moaning, almost sobbing. She finally pushed her husband away. "Get me a washcloth," she told him, putting her legs down on the bed, and riding my cock. He came back after a few seconds, and she lifted herself off of me. She took the washcloth, and cleaned my cock, inspecting it carefully before taking me in her mouth. When she was happy with the results, she pulled me a short ways down the bed, and straddled me. She slid my cock inside her pussy, laying on top of me. 

 Her lips teased my ear. "I had to switch. You're just too big in my ass, with two of you. Let's try it with you in my pussy." 

 "Whatever you need, birthday girl." 

 She kissed me softly, while I fucked her. Then she turned to her husband. "Come on, baby. Your turn in back." 

 He lubed up and mounted her, immediately pounding into her almost desperately. 

 "That's it, honey. Punish my slutty ass. Fuck your slut wife. Whore for two cocks." 

 She lifted her face over mine, smiling, then closed her eyes, and tucked her head beside mine. I held her tightly, nudging my cock in and out of her pussy, while Gary took care of the other side. 

 "As good as your fantasy?" I asked. 

 "Better. Unbelievable. I feel so full, so slutty. I love it." 

 I kissed her pretty face. "You gonna come for us?" 

 She shook her head. "Don't think so. It's wild, but a little uncomfortable. Every time it starts feeling good, something will hurt, putting me off."  

 

 ****** He Looked Like Me Ch.02 ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© "Want us to stop?" 

 "God, no! I want it. Wanna remember this forever. Riding a huge cock, while my hubby plunders my tight ass." 

 We stopped talking, kissing now and then, while I did my best to fill that sweet pussy. Feeling her husband pounding her, through the thin sheath separating our cocks inside of her. 

 "G...Gonna come," he groaned after a couple of minutes. 

 "Give it to me, baby. Spray all over me. Make me your cum-slut." 

 He groaned, pulled out, and came on her ass. I lifted her hips a bit, and pounded her pussy some more. Had to take it while I could. I doubted I'd ever have better. 

 She clung to me, nibbling my neck. "God, Jack! You're gonna make me come again. Again!" 

 "I love to watch you come, Dana. So fuckin' beautiful." 

 She was gasping. "Tell me. Tell me you want me. You'll make me yours." 

 "Best fuck ever," I whispered, long-stroking her pussy. "Incredible. It can't be just this once, Angel. I won't let it. I'm gonna have to have you again. Again and again." 

 She whimpered, "Love my hubby." 

 "Love him all you want, you're gonna fuck me," I growled. 

 "J...just sex," she gasped. 

 "Best fucking sex ever. Fill all your slutty holes. Make you come 'til you pass out." 

 "You'll be my bull. Fuck me. Fuck me like he can't. Make him suck your cum out of my cheating pussy." 

 "Always. Fuck this sweet tight pussy. Fuck your sexy brains out. Make him watch, clean you." 

 "F... F... Fuck," she moaned, and I saw her starting to come again. 

 "Does he make you come like this? Huge fucking orgasms? Coming over and over again?" 

 She whimpered, and her trembling started. 

 "My pussy. Fuckin' my pussy," I groaned. I lifted her hips a bit, and hammered her. 

 She cried out my name, and suddenly her hips were slamming down on my cock, viciously, desperately. I stopped my own motions, making her do the work. 

 I heard Gary's voice from the end of the bed, where he was filming. "Fuck him, baby. Fuck him hard." 

 "You want my cum?" I whispered in her ear. 

 "All of it. Fill me. Fill me for him. Lots. Make him drown in it." 

 "Earn it slut. You can do better." I slapped her ass cheek, then the other one. 

 She was determined. She kissed me, sucking my tongue into her mouth, her hips driving down on my cock. She pulled out of my arms, sat up, and tucked her legs in so she could fuck me harder. Hands on my chest, fingernails digging into me. 

 "Give it to me, Jack. Gimme that cum. It's mine. I earned it," she gasped, glaring at me. 

 "Prove it," I teased, knowing she already had me on edge. 

 "Mine, damn it! Mine!" 

 I was trying to hold back. Never wanted it to end. Beautiful woman desperate for my cock, for my cum. "Fuck, you're good," I groaned. 

 "The best. Best you'll ever have," she demanded. 

 I grabbed her hips, taking over, slamming into her. "Best. Fucking best ever." I pulled her down hard, and surrendered. 

 "Yes!" she practically screamed. "Gimme!" 

 She bounced up and down, tits jiggling beautifully. She was laughing, her joy infectious. All signs of her previous drunkenness seemed long gone. 

 When my heart returned to my chest, she slowed down, rocking slowly. "Mmm, that felt like a good one. You give me a big load, Jack?" 

 "Drained me," I gasped. 

 She giggled, then rolled off of me opening her legs. "Which of my men is going to take care of me? You'll do it, won't you Jack?" 

 "Anything you want, beautiful," I started to move toward her, but she put her hand out, stopping me. 

 "Hubby gets first choice," she teased. "It's his pussy." She rose up on her elbows facing her hubby, who had moved between her legs with the camera again. "You gonna let him take what's yours, baby?" 

 He was back to touching her, obviously enthralled. 

 "Whose pussy, baby. Whose pussy is it?" 

 "Mine," he said firmly. "My pussy." 

 "You gonna let him clean it? Take that last thing that's only yours?" she whispered. "I never let anybody else do that." 

 "My pussy," he whispered, moving closer until his mouth was firmly attached to her. 

 She looked over at me and winked. Fucking evil little girl. She had him pegged. She opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue, and wiggled it. I laid down beside her, making myself accessible, and she sucked me clean. Playfully, teasing, sucking me sweetly. I figured I was done for a while, but it didn't stop her. 

 "I'm gonna need some time," I told her softly. 

 She giggled. "Don't care. I just wanna play with my wonderful new toy. Can I suck you, Jack?" 

 "All you want." 

 That was a lot. I was actually almost hard again when she pulled away. "God, I'm starving. I want my men to take me out and feed me." 

 I realized she probably hadn't eaten all day. Looking at the clock, it was after 8:00 pm. We'd been going at it for hours. 

 Gary laid down on the other side of her. "Enjoying your birthday?" 

 She turned and hugged him. "Best ever. God, I love you so much, Gary! Best hubby in the world." 

 I slid down the bed, cuddling up behind her, my hands caressing her skin. 

 "Bestest wife ever," he said. 

 She leaned back against me, pulling my hand up to cover her tit. "Everything's Ok, baby? It wasn't too much?" 

 He blushed. "No. It was good." 

 She giggled. "You liked it, didn't you? Seeing me get my brains fucked out." 

 "You were beautiful. So damn sexy." 

 She reached out and caressed his face, lovingly. "I'm so sorry about last night. That will never happen again. I promise. God, I don't think I was ever that drunk." 

 He laughed. "No shit. I never saw you like that before." 

 "You gonna help me get even with them?" 

 He looked confused. "How?" 

 "On your birthday. I'm not gonna give away secrets, but we'll have our chance then. You'll help me?" 

 He leaned forward and kissed her. Her naughty hand was between her legs, trying to coax me back into her. I was nibbling her neck and shoulder, running my hand over her perfect ass, stunned that I was almost hard enough to enter her. 

 "Have I ever been able to say no to you?" Gary said. 

 "No, but I don't want you to start now," she giggled. 

 I lifted her leg up and to the side, opening her. A soft hand joined mine, and together we managed to get me back inside of her. 

 Nice and easy, playfully, I fucked her, while her husband made out with her. A few little adjustments and I was able to do a reasonable job. Don't know what the hell the pill was that Gary gave me, but it sure seemed to be doing the job. I tugged her leg, and drove in just a little deeper. 

 "You really are a little slut, aren't you," he whispered. 

 "Only for you, honey." She kissed him again. "I really am starving. I could use breakfast." 

 "IHOP?" Gary asked. 

 "How about you, Jack?" Dana asked. 

 "Gotta eat something, I'm pretty sure my groceries have gone bad." 

 She gasped, then chuckled. "I guess you really do like, me. You could have put your stuff in our fridge," she said. 

 "Guess I got distracted. Not a big deal anyway. You're kind of worth it, and it is your birthday. IHOP works for me." 

 She stretched, arching her back deliciously, pressing her bottom against me. I pushed into her strongly, and she gave a self-satisfied little moan. "God, this is wonderful. I could stay like this forever, between my handsome, loving men. I feel so spoiled." 

 Gary smiled at her, caressing her cheek. "Nobody deserves it more than you, birthday girl." 

 She turned her head, talking back toward me. "Hold that thought for later?" She pushed her rear backward, teasing. 

 "Whatever you need, Dana." 

 "Quick shower, then eats." 

 It was fun, the three of us in a shower, playing with her body, teasing her, while she fought us off, demanding to be fed. She ended up sucking us both for a couple of minutes, before we dried off. 

 I kept wondering about Gary. If I could handle things like he did. Accept her fantasy so easily. He really seemed to have no heartburn over sharing her with me. 

 I had a great time. Teasing, joking, talking about our lives, our pasts. Dana made sure every damn thing she did was as sexy as possible. I was hard halfway through the meal. She was sitting beside her husband, and I was across from her in the booth. I felt her barefoot rubbing my leg, caressing my thigh, before it was pressing against my cock. She looked up at me, grinning, cocking one eyebrow. "Naughty boy," she teased, her foot rubbing me. 

 When the waitress brought over her cake with a candle on it, and everyone sang happy birthday, she was positively glowing. Immediately afterward, she turned to her husband. "Pay the bill. Take me home. Now." 

 In the parking lot, she pulled me into the backseat and was sucking my cock before we even hit the street. "God, I'm so fucking horny," she gasped, before taking me in her mouth again. 

 I looked up at Gary, checking us out in the rear view mirror. "You were teasing her, weren't you, Gary?" 

 He chuckled. "She decided not to wear panties. Not me. Had to give her my napkin to sit on." 

 "Great. You tease the shit out of her, and my poor cock has to deal with the consequences." 

 "Birthday girl gets what she wants. Deal with it." He was laughing. 

 She looked up at me, grinning. "Is it really so terrible?" she whispered. 

 I pulled her up, kissing her. "What do you think?" 

 She smiled. "I think you've figured out my birthday game." 

 I was aching for her by the time we got back. Stripped her naked in the entrance, bent her over the end of the couch, and fucked the shit out of her. The shower and break were exactly what I needed. When I started to get close, I called Gary over, and he took my place. While he fucked her, I got his camera out, and gave it to him. "Get it going." 

 He grinned, got it ready and passed it back to me. 

 I filmed him fucking her, and I sang her birthday song. "It's your birthday, beautiful Dana," I said, sitting on the couch underneath her face. "Time to blow out your candle." 

 She took me in her mouth, sucking distractedly. Gary looked over at me a little later, "Switch?" 

 I pulled her head up, and took his place, pounding her pussy again. I was having fun, smacking her upturned ass, fucking the hot little beauty. She wanted us to wear her out? This was perfect, as long as we were patient. 

 We switched off twice more before I finally got her to come for me. By then she was laying loosely, letting us do whatever we wanted. Not enough for me, and we kept taking turns on her. Gary and I were laughing, high-fiving each other, sharing a beer, fucking her brains out. Sometimes whoever was on deck would play with her, or make her suck us. I had my cock all the way down her throat, when she started showing signs again. 

 "You gotta finish her," Gary gasped. "I'm too close." 

 We switched off again, and I fucked our little married slut like my life depended on it. Stuck my thumb up her ass, and hammered that pussy. She started coming for me, and Gary cheered me on, a big high-five. It was a good one, her legs shaking wildly, as her orgasm went on and on. She cried out trying to buck me off, but I just fucked her harder, while her husband held her down. 

 She grabbed his leg pleading. "Too much, too sensitive." 

 He laughed slapping her ass. "Sluts don't make that decision. We'll use you until we're tired or bored." 

 We switched off twice more, while she moaned and sobbed. For all his words I saw he was checking on her, gesturing me to take it easier a couple of times. I saw him finally smile as she climbed her peak again, screaming at us. 

 "Fuck me! Fuck me you bastards!" 

 She had a huge orgasm, massive, crying out loudly, then collapsing helpless, sobbing. He sat down and held her. "Happy, baby?" She was crying, nodding her head. "I'm so happy." 

 "We're still not done with you," he said. "Let's go." He got up and walked to the bedroom. 

 She tried to follow and almost fell. I picked her up in my arms. "Party time," I teased. 

 We started up where we'd left off, except this time she was on her back, ass hanging off the corner of the bed. It was amazing taking turns on her, one after the other, wondering how long we could keep this up. Gary took too long to switch finally, and came inside of her. He looked up at me, embarrassed. 

 "It's cool." I told him. "She's too damn hot to keep any control. You and I both know that. It was amazing either of us lasted as long as we did." 

 He nodded. "No shit." 

 I let her suck me as he cleaned her up again. He seemed to really have a creampie fetish. Better him than me. Hey, I was willing, but it was something I'd do for her if she wanted, not something I particularly enjoyed. Unlike Gary. 

 It looked like he was down for the count, but we continued switching off, me fucking her, then he would eat her. Dana had recovered from the couch episode and seemed to be enjoying things better. She pulled me close during one of my breaks. "Could you come in me? Kind of secret like? Surprise him." 

 "I don't know. It would be difficult to hide it." 

 "Please? Try. I'd love that." 

 I kissed her softly. "Anything for the birthday girl. Suck me good, get me close, Ok?" 

 She did, giving me her best, and when it was my turn between her legs again, I did what I could. Hammered her hard. Laid on top of her, letting her cling to me, while my hips went into overdrive. 

 "Come for me, Jack?" she pleaded sweetly. "My big strong bull." 

 "I'm close, Angel." 

 "Do this for me, please. I'll make it worth your while. And I don't mean tonight." 

 Fuck. Magic words. I kissed her, then whispered in her ear. "I'm there, gonna come now." 

 "Keep pumping me baby, make it look good." 

 I slowed a little, short even strokes, as my balls emptied inside of her again. I pumped my way through the finish. "God, Jack, you're the best," she whispered, pulling me in for a deep kiss. 

 When she released me, I pulled out of her. "All yours, Gary," I said. 

 I straddled her head, and had her suck me, while her husband took his turn. 

 When I pulled away, needing a real break, I laid beside her, playing with her tits. 

 "Like your surprise, Hubby dear?" she teased. 

 He rose up, chuckling. "You are an evil little girl." He looked over at me. "You could have given me a hint." 

 "Dude. I can't say no to her. Could you?" 

 He laughed, and moved back between her legs. "Not in this lifetime." 

 She giggled. "I'm gonna need some cuddle time after this. Getting super sensitive down there. You did it. Fuckin' wore me out." She giggled. "And then fucked me for another hour afterward, you bastards." 

 She turned to me. "Get me my phone, sweetie? It's in my purse in the living room. You remember the living room, don't you, Jack? Where you destroyed my poor little pussy?" 

 I gave her a quick kiss, and fetched like a good boy. Drank a quart of water before returning. 

 She was cuddling with her husband when I climbed in the bed, handing her the phone. We cuddled and caressed her, touching and rubbing, while she called her friends, gabbing, bragging. 

 "God, I have no idea how many times I've come. Dozens," she said. 

 "Yep, non-stop since the last call except for dinner. Absolutely destroyed me. Unbelievable." 

 Her back was to me again, and I was nibbling her neck, playing with her body. Gary was trying to be subtle as he worked his way down the bed. It wasn't long before he was between her legs. 

 "Gently, baby. Just play a little, Ok? You guys have used me up." She returned to the phone. "No way, bitch! These two are mine." 

 She was giggling, and pushed Gary away. "I need a picture of you two." 

 What the hell. I had no problems. Kind of cheesy, standing side by side, arms around each other shoulders, naked. She took a couple of pictures, and blew us a kiss. "God, I'm so lucky. You guys really are the best." 

 "The best deserves the best, birthday girl," I told her. 

 She was playing with her phone, then talking again. "Only for us, Ok? Nobody outside of our group." 

 "Alright. Call me back after. If I'm busy, I'll call you later." 

 She leaned back in the bed, stretching. "I need a massage." 

 She got it, from both of us, and by the time we finished, the sheets were finally so messy, we all agreed we needed a change. Gary and I tore off the old ones, put down another blanket and fitted sheet in case we weren't done for the night, and joined Dana for another shower. 

 This one was more loving, less playful, passing her back and forth, kissing, caressing. Improbably, her oral efforts produced at least a partial response. She smiled for me. "One more maybe?" 

 "I would like that." 

 "You'll have to be gentle. I mean it." 

 We were in bed, the lights off, several minutes of her oral efforts resulted in the erection I was slipping to her while we laid on our sides. When her phone rang, she waved her hand at her husband and he found it and gave it to her. 

 She giggled. "Still going strong." 

 "Yep. Laying here between my men, feeling nice and full down there." 

 "No, no craziness. Not now. This one's just because, you know. Cuddle-love." 

 "Absolutely. The best." 

 I tuned her out, leaning back and concentrating on the feeling of being inside her. Rehashing the day in my mind. Wondering what I had ever done to be so damn lucky. All of her. I'd had all of her, over and over again. 

 Twice during the night I woke to find her soft sexy body next to mine. I took her, the second time with her laying on top of me half-asleep, I fucked her forever. She was sighing, kissing my neck and shoulders. "Tell me it will never end," she whispered. 

 "Never," I promised. 

 "Just sex. I love my hubby." 

 "More than sex, Angel. I'm sorry. You can still love your hubby best." 

 "Promise? He can be first? You'll still be my bull?" 

 "Always. He's your husband. I understand." 

 "Do you? It's important, Jack." 

 "Shh. It's Ok. You're his." 

 "But I can be yours too, right?" 

 "Yes. I can share." 

 "God, I love you. You're so good." 

 "Love you too, Dana. Never gonna let you go." 

 "You'll never have to. You're my bull. I love my hubby, but my mouth, pussy and ass are yours." 

 "All mine," I whispered. "And I'm going to use them hard." 

 She purred contentedly, as my cock echoed my words, claiming her. 

 I woke to a blowjob, and rolled over on top of her, making love. Slow, easy, intimate. I wondered how much longer before I'd be cast off. I didn't doubt our words of the night before were mostly just words. I would keep her if I could, but she wasn't mine. Truth was, I hardly knew her. She was beautiful, and incredible in bed. Loving and teasing. Playful and passionate. A fantasy made flesh. But that was it. 

 She caressed my cheek. "You're worried." 

 I nodded. "I wish it never had to end." 

 She pulled me down for a quick kiss. "It won't. Let me handle it. I just need a little time." 

 "Don't mess things up because of me," I told her. 

 She smiled. "See. That's the attitude that ensures it won't have to end." 

 I was still enjoying her when Gary walked in, wearing a suit. "Sorry kids. I gotta go to work." 

 I looked over at the clock and saw it was almost 8:00 am. I sighed. "Crap. Me too. Gotta go soon." 

 He sat on the bed, next to us. "Jack, I... I just wanted to say thanks. You made it perfect for her, and for me too, I guess. Thanks." 

 I started to climb off of her, and he pushed me back. "One last one for her. She deserves it. I hope we can be friends after this." 

 "I'd like that." 

 He grinned. "I bet. Don't know if this will ever happen again. Not going to say it won't. I just need some time to deal with it, you understand?" 

 "Of course. Best thing that ever happened to me. I appreciate it." 

 He grinned, standing. "She is the best, isn't she?" 

 "Absolutely." I turned to her, and started pumping her again. 

 "Call me later, baby," Dana called out, as he left us. 

 She looked up at me. "You really have to go?" 

 "I do. Wish I didn't. Soon." 

 She nodded. "Thank you. Leave your number and address. We have to stay in touch."  

 

 ****** He Looked Like Me Ch.02 ****** byTx_Tall_TalesÂ© I loved her passionately, desperately, feeling her slipping away. Some sweet little orgasms, and one last heart-stopping one for me. We showered together, holding each other, slow dancing under the warm water. She dressed me afterward, making sure I wrote down my info, and walked me to the door naked. She kissed me on the doorstep. "Best night of my life, Jack. You'll still be my Jack, right?" 

 "Always, Dana." 

 "Thank you. You had fun?" 

 I pulled her close, kissing her hard. "I lost my heart last night." 

 She looked up at me, and I saw tears in her eyes. "I'm married. I love my husband, more than anything." 

 "I know. It was a beautiful fantasy." 

 "My fantasy. You understand..." 

 "Shh. Don't. Let me believe, Ok?" 

 She nodded, hugging me. "My Jack." 

 His Dana. 

 * * * 

 My birthday. Four months, three weeks, and a day since that night. I've seen them; we both live in the same community. A friendly 'hi' at a restaurant. A lingering look at the grocery store where we met. A wave across two pumps at the gas station. 

 That's all. No calls, no letters, no visits. Nada. 

 I wish to God I'd never met them. I'm ruined. Ruined for all other women. I've dated, had sex. Good sex even. It wasn't her. 

 Loneliest day of my life. I don't know what's wrong with me, that I don't have more friends, or someone that matters in my life. I'm sitting here alone, sipping a beer that's gone warm. Remembering someone else's birthday. Wondering what Gary's birthday surprise was. 

 I contemplated going out, hitting a bar. Maybe going to a strip club. I could have hired an escort, paid for the girlfriend experience. I thought about driving a mile away, knocking on a door, reminding them it was my birthday. 

 Thirty years old. The big 3-0. Good job, nice house, new car. And nobody to share it with. 

 He said I'd find my own version of her. I don't think so. 

 I'm not suicidal. Nor am I crazy. Just a little disappointed at the way life sometimes works out, disappointed and lonely. Pathetic, I know. 

 I pour out my Shiner in the sink. I'm not that far gone that I'll sit here in the dark, crying in my beer. So it's my fuckin' birthday. So what? Just another day on the calendar. I've survived 29 previous ones. Less than an hour and a half until this one's done. 

 Turning off the light in my kitchen, I hear the doorbell. My heart races. Maybe. Just maybe. I know how important birthdays are to the two of them. How sad she was to hear that our foreplay was better than any gift I'd ever received. I can almost smell her. Maybe. Maybe they remembered. 

 I open the door, stunned, to see her there. After all this time. I can tell she's nervous, her hands trembling. She pushes a card out to me before I can even say anything. 

 Happy Birthday Jack, 

 You gave me the greatest birthday present ever. Here's hoping I can return the favor. 

 Love Always, Dana 

 I look up at her, her shape fuzzy. I wipe my eyes, and see she's trembling, waiting. Here on my birthday. What kind of asshole would I be to leave her standing there? 

 "Come in, please. It's been a while. You're looking more beautiful than ever." 

 She smiles, and then she's in my arms. I can't help but hug her back. So familiar. As if we'd never been apart. The feel of her, the smell of her hair. I squeezed her tighter. 

 "Happy birthday, Jack. Sorry I'm a little late," she whispers. 

 "Better late than never, Linda. Much better."
