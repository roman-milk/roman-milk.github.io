 ****** A Daddy's Love ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© ============================ 

 A father's cautionary tale 

 Something a little different for Christmas. There is little sex in this story. It's a tale of love, of family, of strained marital relationships. A story of love between fathers and daughters, pure love, a Daddy's love. 

 This is an entry in the WINTER HOLIDAYS STORY CONTEST 2013. 

 Thanks to PatientLee for her last minute reading and rescue. The ending was a mess and she helped me spot why. She hasn't seen this version so don't blame her if it still doesn't work. 

 ============================ 

 I'm going to scream if one more person asks me if I'm alright. 

 Jessica was exhausted, and a little fed up. She'd always come home for the holidays, alternating Thanksgiving and Christmas with Michael's family. For most of her adult life, it had been a much needed break from the business of being a mother, a wife, and a businesswoman. 

 With her mother's passing, she was afraid things would be different this Christmas, but she wasn't ready to be forced into the hostess role at Dad's. Sure, he took care of cooking the standing rib roast, and made the mashed potatoes: his special potatoes, creamy, rich, buttery, and probably heart clogging. She'd have to put in another 5 miles just because of those potatoes. 

 If it had just been them, it wouldn't have been so bad, but Aunt Carolyn and her brood had to show up, with her two cousins, both still living at home in their mid-twenties. They were as useless as tits on a bull. 

 They'd all stayed up late, socializing after the better part of a year apart. Drank a little too much eggnog. Getting up at the crack of dawn to fill the stockings and put out the 'Santa' presents for Ashley's sixth Christmas was the highest priority, but the lack of sleep combined with the long drive, was making her irritable. 

 Add the responsibility of pulling the traditional meal together along with all the other things going on in her life, and she'd become downright snippy. 

 She turned to her father, who was checking the temperature on the roast. "Did we have to invite Aunt Carolyn?" she mumbled, for his ears only. 

 "They're family, baby girl. You know her husband's in Shanghai, they would have been alone." 

 "You'd think they could do something to help around here." 

 Her Dad shrugged. "We wouldn't be very good hosts now if we asked them to work." 

 "I know, but you think they'd volunteer, wouldn't you?" 

 He gave her a grin. "Before we judge, let's give 'em a chance to do the right thing." 

 Jessica knew that was a waste of time. They'd always been selfish, and today was no exception. Instead of helping, her two younger cousins were monopolizing Ashley's time, playing with her under the tree. At least someone was having a good time. She glanced over through the dining room into the formal living room, where the 12 foot tree towered, and a field of presents for a precocious 5 year old stretched as far as the eye could see. 

 Jessica turned back to the stove, checking her list, trying to time all the dishes properly. At least Aunt Carolyn had set the table, and baked the pies the night before. The incessant grinding of the homemade ice cream maker groaned on and on, one more irritant she could have done without. 

 But the homemade butter pecan ice cream was another tradition. She'd always loved them growing up, but was starting to think she could do without a few. Did it always have to be butter pecan? And why the sweet potatoes? The whole bit about sitting around as a family watching the same old happily-ever-after Christmas movies every year. Was she the only one bored with the banality, the sameness? 

 She felt the familiar hands on her shoulders, sliding inward to massage her neck. She almost brushed them away, but knew that would have been noticed. She didn't need him pouting, or Dad questioning. 

 "You alright, Jess? Anything I can do?" her husband's voice sounded beside her ear. 

 "I think we've got it. We'll be ready to eat in less than 20 minutes. You might want to start winding Ashley down." 

 Michael walked over to the oven, peeking in at the roast which was just about to come out. "You always put on the best spread, Dad," he said. 

 "Once a year. It doesn't seem like a time for holding back." Her father opened the oven door, and pulled out the gorgeous roast, the bared end of eight rib bones exposed. That was their signal. Fifteen minutes to go. 

 Jessica cleared the front left burner, and set out the pan for her father, turning on the flame underneath. He lifted the roast by the rack and set it on the counter to settle, before pouring half the drippings into a pan. Jess couldn't help but smile. So predictable. He always made a dark gravy to go with the drippings. 

 She slid past him, bumping his butt with hers, to make room for her to pass, and stuck the two trays of biscuits into the vacated oven rack. She ducked under his arms in the kitchen dance, returning to her side dishes, while he plucked the sweet potatoes off the bottom rack, before closing the oven door. 

 It was moments like this when her mother's absence hit her hardest. Playing in the kitchen, remembering all she'd been taught by her Mom, watching the interplay that her parents had displayed all her life. She recalled how they'd included her over the years, making her responsible for hand-mashing the potatoes, setting out the biscuits, ordering all the cooking materials on the center island. 

 Over the years her mother had bequeathed more and more of her tasks to her daughter, while she retained the secondary duties, washing up as they went, acting as timekeeper, setting the table, preparing the iced tea, getting the coffee maker ready. All the background tasks, while allowing her father and her to pull the complex meal together. 

 She looked over at the growing pile of dishes, and her irritation returned. You would think somebody could help. Her father bumped her hips with his, and glanced at the clock. She bumped him back, then did a little pirouette around him before peeking in on the rolls. "Looks good." 

 "Your call," her father said. 

 The words made her choke up a bit. It was the first holiday without her mother, and it was always Mom's call. "Two more minutes," she said. Her voice quivered. 

 Her father slid his beefy arm over her shoulder the side of his head touching hers. "Me too, honey. I miss her too. She loved Christmas dinner." 

 He could always do that. He always knew what she was thinking. Jessica had been Daddy's girl, but the connection was stronger than almost anyone she knew. Maybe because she was an only child. Unlike a lot of fathers, he'd always been there growing up. She remembered he'd only missed one basketball game in her entire high-school career. He'd been devastated, calling from the airport, wishing her luck. She'd hit the game winning shot, perhaps her best game ever. She recalled hearing the TV around midnight, and found her father perched in front of it, his chair pulled up close, watching the video her mother had taken. 

 "It's not the same, Dad," she said, lifting the pots off the burners, draining them, and filling the good china servers one at a time. 

 He continued stirring the gravy, adjusting the consistency by eye. "I know, Pumpkin." He turned to her, and ran his fingers through her long hair. "It may never be the same, but what are you going to do, give up? We keep going baby girl. We adapt, we do our best, and we keep going." 

 Michael entered the kitchen, standing out of the way. Seven years of training had taught him his role. Jessica pushed the completed items his way, and he started relaying them to the table. It was automatic, the result of years of familiarity 

 Jessica watched him out of habit, to make sure everything went in the right place. The huge pecan wood dining table had been part of their lives as long as Jessica could remember. Two of the three leaves were added, and it was set for seven. Her place was on her father's left, as it always had been, Ashley beside her, between her and Michael. Aunt Carolyn was opposite her, on her father's right, her sons beside her. With Mom gone, it wasn't right. 

 She watched her husband, as predictable as her father. He put the dishes in their places, then walking past each setting to make sure everything was as it should be. 

 Jessica pulled on her heat proof gloves, and peeled the foil back off the sweet potatoes. She slit them open, and slathered each with a chunk of butter. The beeping of the oven timer alerted her and she dashed over to the oven, pulling out the rolls, checking the bottoms. Perfect. 

 She put the hot brick in the bottom of the roll basket, set the cloth on top of it, and loaded it up with the steaming rolls, before tucking the four corners back over the top to keep them hot and moist. 

 "Go time," she announced. It was her call now. 

 Her father gave her a grin, lifted the roast off the rack, and placed it on the largest serving platter. She leaned around him, adding the sprigs of parsley, and a little fresh rosemary, like her mother always had. 

 Michael stood waiting, their daughter at his side. That was new. Ashley looked excited. "The gravy?" he asked. 

 She nodded, and placed the prepped sweet potatoes on their serving plate while her husband filled the gravy boat. Her father already had the roast drippings in a second one. 

 Michael took the basket of rolls and put it in their daughter's hands. He was whispering to her, and she nodded. Jessica watched him kiss Ashley's forehead, and she had another of those pangs of pain, the doubt resurfacing. She pushed it away, for at least one more day. 

 She wouldn't spoil Christmas. She owed them that much. 

 Michael led the march, walking into the dining room, and setting the gravy boats about a third of the way down the table. Ashley carried the antique basket, her grin bathing the room in her joy. Her father pulled out his chair, and lifted her to stand on the seat. He held her by the waist while she leaned over the table to place the rolls in the opening left for them. 

 Aunt Carolyn, and cousins Jeff and Rick all told her what a wonderful job she'd done with the rolls, as her father lifted her over to her chair, seating her before handing her a napkin. 

 Jessica carried in the second largest platter, the heaping mound of mashed potatoes in the middle, the foil wrapped sweet potatoes decoratively positioned around the perimeter. Michael pulled her chair out, while she sat. "Perfect as always, Jess," he whispered, kissing her cheek. 

 She fought the urge to roll her eyes. Same as always. 

 Her father finally made his grand entrance, bearing the huge roast which he placed directly in front of his place at the head of the table. The smell of the rack of ribs infused the room, and the previous expectant quiet shattered as everyone talked about the meal in front of them. 

 It was enough to feed twice as many, which was another tradition. Nobody would go hungry, or miss out on their favorites. The mac and cheese, a two year old tradition, was evidence of that. The leftovers would make meals for the next few days. 

 Dale spoke up. "As always, and in the family tradition, we turn to the smartest among us on this special day. Ashley, would you say the blessing?" 

 Jessica couldn't help smile. Until three years ago, when her father made that announcement, she'd been responsible for saying grace. Sometimes change was for the better. 

 Ashley looked up at her grandfather smiling, and folded her hands in front of her. "Bless us, O Lord, and these, Thy gifts..." 

 Jessica listened to her daughter say grace, and wondered what Thanksgiving would be like. How the changes would affect them. All of them. 

 "... Amen. And God bless Mommy and Daddy, Granpa Ed, and Gramma Grace, Aunt Wendy and Uncle Crisfitter," Jessica saw her daughter peek up at Michael, and he nodded for to go on. "Maddy and Katy, and cousins Jeffey and Ricky," she glanced across the table, where the men were smiling at her, "Aunt Carolyn, and Grampa Dale, and please take care of Gramma in Heaven." 

 "Amen," added Michael beside her, and rest of the table chimed in. He leaned over and whispered, "You did perfect, baby girl. I'm proud of you." 

 Dale stood at the end of the table, gazing out on his family. "Ashley, that was a beautiful blessing, the best we ever had. Thank you." As Jessica recalled every year's blessing was the best they'd ever had. 

 Her father lifted his good carving knife dramatically, before slicing off the end of the roast. "Who wants an end piece?" 

 The dinner was a raucous time, talking about the gifts, and Christmases past. They argued over which was the best all time Christmas TV show. Dale still argued for A Christmas Story, while his sister wouldn't back off Miracle on 34th street. The male cousins split, with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and another Christmas Story vote. When Ashley insisted Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer was the best, Michael changed his vote from White Christmas to Rudolph. Her father leaned over toward Jessica. "You haven't added your two cents, Pumpkin." 

 "Does anyone really care, Dad?" she mumbled, pushing her food around her plate. 

 He set his utensils down, and faced her. "Do you honestly think I don't care, Jessie?" he was the only one that had ever called her that, at least that she allowed to. "What's wrong, baby girl?" 

 She sighed. "Never mind. Forget I said anything. I guess I'm just tired." 

 Her father leaned forward, to get his granddaughter's attention. "Ashley, sweetie, what's your momma's favorite Christmas Movie?" Dale asked. 

 "Elf!" Ashley said firmly. "Right Daddy?" 

 "Elf," Michael confirmed, "then Christmas Vacation." 

 Jessica blushed with all the attention on her, the last thing she wanted. Was she as predictable as everyone else? She turned back those thoughts, best not to go down that path. Not then. "The roast is perfect, Dad, as always." 

 He shrugged. "More than 30 years of practice, it should be halfway decent." 

 The conversation turned away from Jessica, and to safer subjects. 

 As the platters emptied, and appetites were sated, Jessica stood to clear the table before dessert and start on the unenviable cleanup. Carolyn stood quickly facing across the table. "No you don't, young lady. Your job is done. We've got the dishes and cleanup. You and the grill master have earned a break." 

 "Who wants coffee?" Michael asked, standing, empty plate in hand. 

 Nobody declined, not even Ashley. He shuttled in the coffees, including Ashley's which notably had a distinct aroma of chocolate, and mini-marshmallows floating on top. 

 After dinner, they'd always wait until after the first movie before dessert. Nobody ever saved room for dessert. Jessica and her father were chivied out of the dining room while the others cleaned up. They sat on the couch sipping their coffee, while Ashley played with her huge three story Barbie Dreamhouse, which was nearly as tall as her. 

 "How are we supposed to get that home, Dad? It's too much. You always go overboard." Jessica said. 

 Her father laughed. "I don't recall you ever complaining about that growing up. Don't worry, Michael and I will figure out some way to fit it in the van. If we need to, we'll strap it to the front." 

 She nodded absentmindedly, her mind on other issues. 

 Her father scooted nearer, rubbing her shoulder. "Why don't you tell me what the problem is, Jessie." 

 She shook her head. "It's just the holidays I guess. I've got a lot of stress right now. I'll get over it soon enough." 

 "I thought you and I could talk about anything. Something's eating you up. You know you can tell me," he insisted. 

 "It's no big deal, Dad. Let's just drop it Ok?" 

 He nodded. "She's growing up fast," he said, watching Ashley arranging the furniture in the dollhouse. "You two have done a great job with her." 

 Jessica smiled. "Best thing in my life," she said. 

 Dale grinned. "I know that feeling." 

 That little conversation was the only break in routine, the last thing of interest that Christmas. They watched a movie, ate dessert, and watched their second movie. They professed how much they missed each other, then did some preliminary packing. Ashley fell asleep and they tucked her in with her favorite toys. As part of their tradition, Jessica let Michael make love to her. He cuddled up to her afterward, telling her it was the best Christmas ever, because he had her and Ashley. The same as always. 

 * * * 

 Ten in the morning the following day, everything was packed, and somehow crammed into the vehicle. After kisses all around they prepared to leave. "Thanksgiving next year," Michael said. "I love your roast, Dad, but nobody cooks a turkey like you. Don't tell my mom I said that." 

 Ashley got more than her share of the kisses, before getting tucked into the back seat among a carefully selected subset of her Christmas gifts. 

 At the last moment Dale pulled his daughter aside. "I'm always a phone call away. I know your mother always did the calling, but I know how to use a phone too." 

 Jessica gave him a hug, wondering what their next holiday would be like. If they'd even have one. "I'll call." 

 She started to pull away, but he hugged her even tighter. "You've got a great life, and a wonderful family. Family is everything. Don't forget that." 

 "I know Dad." 

 "Do you?" he asked, releasing her, holding her at arm's length, looking into her eyes. 

 The look discomfited her. She hated to disappoint him. Times were different. He'd understand, eventually. She sighed. "We've gotta go." 

 His sad look haunted her for most of the six-hour journey home. 

 * * * 

 She hugged her husband at the curb, then squatted down for a hug from her daughter. "Don't go Momma," the little girl wailed. 

 "It's only for a couple of days, baby. Daddy and Miss Jill will take care of you. I wish I didn't have to leave, but it's important, alright?" 

 Michael had his wallet out. "I know you never have enough cash on you. I hate for you to travel without a few bucks in your wallet. Here." He put some twenties in her hand. 

 "I have the credit cards and debit card. I'll be fine." She took the money anyway, she knew that he'd argue until she did. Wasn't that the whole issue? She knew exactly what he'd do, before he did it. 

 "Call me," he said. "Call me when you get there, so I'll know you made it safe." 

 "I will. I'll try to call every night, but we're going to be very busy." Very, very busy, she thought. 

 He pulled an envelope out of his back pocket and handed it to her. "Your father asked me to give this to you. I guess you told him about your trip. You knew about it before Christmas?" 

 She took the envelope in her hand, her name blazoned across the front, his distinctive writing guaranteeing who it was from. "I had just found out, I didn't want to ruin Christmas." 

 He nodded. "I wish you'd talk to me, Jess. I... I don't like these surprises. Sometimes I feel like I don't even know half of what's going on in your life." 

 She sighed. "Don't make a big deal out of it, Michael. It's just three days. I'll be back for New Years." She tucked the envelope into her purse, and grabbed her bags. "Be good for your father, Ashley." 

 Jessica turned to walk through the airport doors. Standing in the ticket line, she looked back. Michael was holding their daughter on his shoulder. They both waved when they saw her looking. She waved at the two of them, before turning and shuffling forward in the line. When she reached the front, she looked back and they were still watching. She gave them a last wave, and stepped up to the counter.

 Holiday traveling was the pits. She'd arrived more than an hour early, and now her flight was delayed forty minutes. She picked up her phone, and texted him. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** A Daddy's Love ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© Forty minute delay - Sorry. 

 The response was almost immediate. 

 I hate every minute lost, but would wait forever. 

 She smiled. The man was full of shit, but he had a way with words. She felt the rush of excitement once again. 

 Soon. I can hardly wait. 

 An anxious few seconds, she waited eagerly for his response, getting that hot feeling. Enough words, pictures, skyping. It was time. Obviously he agreed. 

 I can't believe the wait is nearly over. The things I'm going to do to you... 

 She heard the announcement from overhead. They were changing her gate, damn it! 

 

 Gotta go. Gate change. Text when I arrive. 

 She closed the phone, grabbed her bags and got up with a sigh, moving six gates down before settling in for what looked to be an hour long wait. 

 She put her purse on the chair next to her, hoping to hold off any business Romeos who thought an empty chair beside a single woman was an invitation. She wasn't dressed particularly sexy, she didn't want to advertise what she was up to, but she knew she looked nice. For him. 

 Her glance noted the envelope from her father. That was a strange comment from Michael, about her father knowing about her travel. She hadn't told anyone. She didn't dare, not even Jill, who would have given her more grief she didn't need. She pulled out the letter and found it was sealed. She tore open the end, and pulled out the sheets full of his handwriting. She could tell he'd spent time on it, half the time his chicken scratch was illegible, but not now. 

 

 

      Dearest Jessica, 

      I want to tell you about a father's love. 

      You know, you have to know, you're the best thing that ever happened      to me and your mother. You made our lives complete, and have never      been anything but a source of joy. 

      Not that you weren't ever a source of trouble. Heck, we knew that      before you were even born. The heartburn you gave your mother nearly      drove me insane. And those cravings of hers, Chinese food, three or      four days a week. Week in, week out. Always the same dish, the same      place. Is it any wonder white rice was about all we could get you to      eat for years? 

      From the moment I first held you in the delivery room, you changed my      life, for the better. I held you, and knew that you were my      responsibility from that moment on. I brought you into this world,      and it can be a tough and challenging one. I told myself at that time      that I'd always be there for you. Your anchor in the tempestuous sea      that is life. 

      You were a colicky baby. Drove me and your Mom nuts. Every night, for      about four months, your cries would wake us up. You know how your      mother was about getting her sleep, so I handled it. Night after      night I'd hold you, pressed to my chest. After a few minutes of      walking the floor you'd quiet. Unless I put you down of course. I      learned quickly. I'd walk you until the crying ended, then hold you      in that old rocking chair. The one in my bedroom now. Now you know      why I said I'd never get rid of it. 

      I'd hold you and rock you. I'd sing to you. I know, you were too      young to be punished like that, and I'll be damned if I'd sing for      anybody else, but I'd sing for you. I'd sing, and you'd sleep. All      night long I'd hold you, gazing on your precious face, memorizing      every line, every hair. Your mother gave me hell a few times for      napping with you in my arms. She was scared that I might drop you, in      my sleep. Groundless fears, I knew better. Nothing short of      Armageddon would make me drop you. Asleep or not, you were mine, and      nothing would hurt you so long as I could take a breath, certainly      not me. 

      Your mother would take over around six in the morning, and I'd crawl      off to bed for a couple of hours of sleep before work. I lost a lot      of sleep over you those first six months. I don't begrudge you a      single minute. That time holding you is among my favorite memories.      Your mother believes it was those early months that connected us.      Creating an unbreakable bond. 

      I know we share a lot of memories, and you've heard a lot of stories,      but those early years were so precious I can't help myself. You were      too young to remember them, but I can play them back on demand, and      do so, often. 

      Saturdays were wonderful. Your mother worked Saturdays the first four      years of your life. Saturdays were for us. You were all mine. Once      you were old enough to let me know what you wanted, in no uncertain      terms I might add, we'd get our morning Slurpee at 7-11, stop in at      Mom's work just so you two could see each other, and then we'd drive.      You were so smart, so curious about everything. We'd take long drives      and you'd pepper me with questions. When you'd run out, I'd tell you      stories. I'd look at you, perched in your car seat, staring at the      world around you, and reflect on how lucky a man I was. 

      I remember the first time you insisted that you drive. I held you in      my lap, your tiny hands on the steering wheel. We'd crawl along, your      hands turning the wheel, my fingers secretly at the bottom because      you got so mad if you couldn't do it on your own. I only had to nudge      it now and then. Your mother got so angry, but once we did it as a      family, she understood. Even then you were undeniable. 

      I think it was third grade, when you asked me about a book, and I      hadn't read it. You seemed shocked, like I had failed you, because I      didn't know every book ever written. From that time forward, every      book you had to read for school, I'd pull out of your book-bag the      first night you brought it home. I'd take it to my study, once you      and your mother were asleep and read it cover-to-cover. Just so I      could answer any question you had. I'd never let you down again. At      first it only took a few minutes, but by high-school it might take      hours. I started reading all your books as soon as they entered the      house. You got irritated, that I'd read it before you, and the next      thing I knew, you'd be reading it front to back the first night you      had it. Of course by the next day, I'd had my chance, and we could      discuss it. Did you really think I read all those books for fun? I      read them so I could share them with you. Because I loved you. Trust      me on this one, that took a hell of a lot of love. 

      I don't want to think about how many hundreds of hours I spent      listening to music that sometimes made me want to drive pencils into      my eardrums. If it was a band you mentioned, or something you sang      along to on the radio, I'd sit at my computer late at night, and look      them up. I'd listen to their music, comparing them to the music I      loved and look for the similarities. I'd introduce you to my own      music, and we could talk. I had a need to understand you, and I      wanted that bridge between us. I still think you owe me an apology      for the Backstreet Boys / Hanson years. 

      As you grew older, you still turned to me, all the way through      middle-school. I didn't know what I was doing, or course. I was a      first time father. I was winging it, but I swear to you, I did my      best. I hope you believe that. 

      I know at times my involvement in your activities probably irked you.      Assistant coach on your volleyball team, team leader for your      Destination Imagination activities, chaperon for your weekend      volunteer outings. I'm sorry about that. My only excuse is I wanted      to be there if you needed me. 

      I was living with a timer. I knew I was losing you little by little.      Your friends, your schooling, your activities were drawing you away.      College was looming ever closer. It was selfish on my part, but I      wanted as many moments with you as possible, before you moved on. 

      You were the best daughter in the world. So beautiful, so smart, such      a kind and loving child. You're like your mother in so many ways. I'm      sorry you got so many of my physical features. If I had a dime for      every person who said you looked just like me, I'd be a wealthy man.      I don't see it, to be honest. You're so beautiful, and I'm anything      but. 

      High school was difficult, I confess. It's when your mother's and my      ideas of raising you conflicted most. We both know she was over-      protective, and I was too lenient. She wanted to know where you were      every minute of every day, what you were doing, who your friends      were, what they were teaching you in school. She hated for you to      spend the night away. She was scared to death at the idea of you      driving. A single drop of rain was cause for panic if you were on the      road. 

      I took the opposite tact, and I know it drove her crazy. I trusted      you. I believed we did right raising you, and I expected you to make      the right decisions. I told you that you could do anything you put      your mind to, and I believed it with every fabric of my being. My      daughter could do anything! 

      You flourished, but not without some hiccups on the way. Some painful      ones admittedly. Bad choices with friends a few times. I won't remind      you of the two times I stood beside you in municipal court. I was      appalled and the second time very angry. But I stood beside you. You      learned from your mistakes, and I was proud. 

      The friends were a different problem. I know you hated me there for a      while, your freshman year. It broke my heart, but I did it for you.      Taking you out of public school, away from your issues and putting      you into private school was hard, in many ways. Fourteen grand a year      was a lot of money for us, but your future was infinitely more      valuable. I accepted your condemnation, and the rift it caused      between us, in order to get your life back on track. I drove you the      twelve miles to school and back, and though you barely spoke to me      for two months, I still treasure those moments spent alone with you.      Driving in the car together, like those first four years. 

      I know it seems like my words are wandering, but there is a point. I      did my best. I spared no expense. I tried like hell to give you a      great start in life. Because I loved you. I loved every single moment      we shared. The memories of you and your mother are the most valuable      things I'll ever have. 

      For everything I did, I saw a pay off. You got into your first choice      college. You graduated with your Master's degree in four years. You      found an incredible job, and I was astounded that by the time you      were 25, you were earning more than I did for most of my life. It's      what any father want for his child. For them to have a better life      than he did. In your case, that was going to be a difficult task,      because I had you. 

      Then you met Michael. I knew I'd hate him the moment I heard his      name. The way you said it, the way your eyes lit up. He sure as hell      didn't impress me much when we did meet. I wanted better for you. 

      I'm a father. Boys scare me, when it comes to you. I never told you,      but there's a reason our friends next door moved away. I'm not proud      of what I did, but I'd do it again. Your mother told me of your first      sexual experience with Andy. You were fourteen, he was seventeen and      had no business talking you into a blowjob, for him or his friend. 

      I confronted his father. I told him I was upset, and why. He told me      he was sorry and that he'd talk to Andy. Unfortunately, the talk, I      later found out, was congratulatory and he was encouraging his son to      do more. I won't tell you what I did, but it is the reason they got      divorced and moved away. I did something bad, but I'd do it again      tomorrow to protect you. There is nothing I wouldn't do. I'd condemn      my soul to hell, if it would save yours. Perhaps I have. 

      Back to Michael. That little bastard wanted my daughter. My perfect      baby girl. I knew why. Hell, anyone who looked at you would. You were      beautiful, and turned heads from your earliest years. He didn't      deserve you. No way. For that matter, I wasn't sure anyone did. 

      I was wrong. It took me a couple of years, I'll admit, to come to      that conclusion. He's a good man. He's been a great provider, husband      and father. Of course that's my opinion, from the outside looking in.      I don't have to live with the guy. 

      More to the point, he loves you and your daughter, and that girl      adores the ground he walks on. He'd do anything for her. He and I are      not much alike. I guess not all girls marry someone like their      father. But the way he is with her, the way they are together, I see      us. You and me, the way we were. 

      The same love. The same desire to protect. 

      A Daddy's love. 

      Jessica, I've always been proud of you. Always. You're everything a      father could wish for. 

      Until now. 

      Don't do this. I don't know what your problem is, you won't talk to      me anymore. With your mother gone, I know you don't have her to vent      to. But there's something wrong. I know you, Jessie. I know you      probably better than I know myself. 

      If you're reading this, I know you're about to make a big mistake.      The biggest of your life. I've always told you I'd back you through      anything. I can't this time. 

      It's about a Daddy's love. The love I had for you. The best part of      my life. If you do this, it's likely you'll destroy your family.      You'll tear apart that bond between your husband and your daughter. 

      You'll deprive him of the relationship that we had. You will steal      the memories, the moments that those two should have shared. It is      the cruelest thing I can imagine. 

      If anyone tried to get in between you and me, tried to steal those      moments from me, I'd tear the fucking world apart before I would let      that happen. And I won't sit by idle while you do that to him. 

      Again, I don't know your issues. The only thing I do know, is that to      the outside world, you've been good for each other. He's not abusive,      he's supportive, and he loves you two. You've done an incredible job      raising my granddaughter. 

      You loved him once. I know you love that little girl. If your problem      is serious, he deserves to know about it, and to try to work through      it. That little girl deserves at least that much. I would hope you'd      expend every effort to make things right, before giving up. Fight for      what you have, don't surrender so damn easily. 

      You're an adult. I can't tell you what to do. All I can do is hope      I've raised you right, so you'll make good decisions. That, and be      here for you when you need me. 

      If you go ahead with this, if you break that child's heart, if you      steal the chance for Michael to have the bond that I had, the      memories that keep me going, I will not support you. Unless you do      this the right way, and make every effort to fix whatever your      problem is, you will break more than one bond. It kills me to say it,      but I will no longer consider myself your father. 

      My daughter would not be sitting in an airport, about to betray her      husband, her daughter, her family, and everything she was raised to      believe. 

      Not my daughter. I won't believe it. 

      I'm begging you. Don't betray a Daddy's love. Don't destroy it just      because you can. Don't break a father's heart into a million pieces. 

      I want to believe I raised you better than that. I have to, or I've      failed at the only thing that ever mattered to me. You. 

      Sincerely, Dale. 

 

 

 Jessica stared at the paper, the smeared writing near the end that told her in more than words, how difficult it was for him to write that. How much she'd hurt him. The signature alone screamed his pain. 

 The wet splotches grew more frequent as his harsh words hit home, and her tears joined his on the thin parchment. 

 How he knew, she couldn't understand. She never could, but he always did. She was on the verge of doing something irreversible. Something that could very well destroy her marriage and her family. 

 And for what? Because she was bored? Tired of the same routine? 

 Someone complimented her, flattered her, flirted and she liked the attention and the excitement. Was that worth breaking her vows, and risking all that mattered to her. Was she that kind of woman? 

 She had told herself she deserved a little excitement. It wouldn't hurt anybody. She could get it out of her system, and nobody had to know. If they did find out, she knew Michael loved her enough to forgive her. And if he didn't, was that so bad? Their life was in a rut. She could do better. 

 What the hell was she thinking? 

 She grabbed her phone. 

 Change of plans. It's over. Don't contact me again 

 She prayed it wasn't too late. That the mistakes she'd already made weren't too severe, that she might be forgiven. She had to brush the tears out of her eyes twice before she could type in the phone number correctly. 

 "Michael, the trip is canceled. Can you come back and pick me up?" 

 "What's wrong Jess? Something's wrong isn't it? What happened? We're not even home yet. I can be there in twenty minutes." 

 She heard the concern, the panic in his voice. "Take your time, I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere. I'll explain it later tonight, if you don't mind. It's complicated. I just want to say I'm sorry." 

 "Don't worry about that. So I wasted an hour, what's that in the big scheme of things? Instead I get you for three more days. Three days that we would never have gotten back again. I'm gonna hang up, there's traffic ahead. I'll be there as soon as I can." 

 "I know you will. I love you Michael." 

 "Love you too, baby." 

 She stared at the phone. A new text had appeared. She responded angrily. 

 Over. No more. Leave me alone. 

 She looked down at her feet, where she'd dropped the letter. She picked it up, ordering the pages. She folded it, and put it back in the envelope. She picked up the phone again. Dialed an almost forgotten number. 

 "Daddy? I...I did a bad thing. A horrible thing." 

 "No you didn't, Pumpkin." 

 "I did. And I don't know what to do." 

 "You did a bad thing, baby girl. You didn't do the horrible thing. And I'm pretty sure you know what to do about it." 

 His voice was echoing in her ears. She looked up and saw him. Not twenty feet away, all this time. She saw the tracks of the tears down his face. Before she could help herself she was scrambling over the row of chairs in front of her. He caught her in his arms before she could fall. 

 Of course he did. He'd never let her get hurt. She knew that. 

 "I'm sorry," she sobbed. 

 He held his girl, the most precious thing in the world. No longer the infant at his chest, the tiny tyke learning to drive on his lap. She wasn't the angry teenager, or the proud graduate. Not the beautiful woman standing at the altar as he gave her away, or the exhausted new mom, pale, sweaty, matted hair, the most gorgeous she'd ever been, passing him his only grandchild. No she wasn't any of those, she was all of them, and more. 

 "I know you're sorry, Pumpkin. But you're telling the wrong man." 

 "How Daddy? How do I tell him? What can I say? I've ruined everything." 

 He peeled her arms away, and wiped the tears from her face. He put his arms around her, and walked her back to her things. He didn't like the way that guy two seats over was looking at her purse. Nobody screwed with his family. 

 "My girl can do anything. You'll figure out a way. I know you will." 

 "Will you come with me? Michael will be here in a few minutes." 

 "No, Jessie. This is between you guys. There's somewhere I've got to be." 

 The overhead announced the boarding of her flight. He gave her a hug and a kiss. "I knew you'd do the right thing." 

 She called after him, as he walked away. "Where are you going?" 

 "I've got a plane to catch." 

 Nobody screwed with his family. 

 * * * 

 Jessica looked up from the dishes, checking out the window where her daughter was playing. She was playing outside a lot, giving Michael and her time to deal with their issues. He didn't get off scot-free, but she wasn't brain-dead enough to try to blame it on him. It was easily 90% her fault. She had everything she wanted, everything she'd dreamed of, all the things she'd talked about, and it wasn't enough. 

 She smiled to herself. Her butt still hurt. She absolutely couldn't believe he'd spanked her. She hadn't been spanked since she was five year's old, for lying. Not much angered her father more than bold-faced lying. Report_Story #3 

 

 ****** A Daddy's Love ****** byTx_Tall_Tales© She remembered the tears on his face, when he finished spanking her. 

 The spanking from Michael didn't result in tears, at least not on his part. The sex was passionate, fierce, demanding. She was almost afraid to tell him it was the best in years, later, while cuddled in his arms. 

 It was the first time she remembered him crying about anything other than Ashley. He hugged her tightly. "You don't hate me? Hate me for treating you like that?" he said. "I...I'm sorry." 

 She turned in his arms and kissed him. "Hate you? Never. I love you, and I know you're angry with me, and have every right to be. If a little spanking and incredible sex is the price I have to pay to make it up, I think we can manage that." She giggled. "You were an animal. The way you held me in the air, pounding into me, damn that was hot!" 

 He chuckled. "I know. Not too, I don't know, cro-magnon?" 

 "Not at all. When you had me pinned on my belly, for a second there I thought you were going to put it in my bottom. You had me scared there for a bit. I couldn't believe you had your fingers in there." 

 "I almost did. I don't know how I got so carried away," Michael confessed. 

 Jessica cuddled into him. "Next time you need to spank me, maybe you should." 

 He stiffened in her arms. "You said..." 

 "The hell with what I said. I'm yours Michael. Get it through your thick head. Just make sure you use plenty of lube. If it turns out I really hate it, it'll be the last time." 

 "I love you, Jess." He whispered, his hands roaming, and she found out he'd stiffened in more than one place. 

 She pushed him on his back, and mounted him with a tiny grimace. She was sore, but she needed this. They both did. The years of vanilla sex was just one of the issues, but it looked like they had that one in hand. She gave her husband a kiss, rocking slowly. "Don't ever tell my Dad about the spanking. He'd blow his top. He doesn't believe in corporal punishment." 

 Michael laughed. "You don't know your father as well as you think you do. It was his idea. He said he'd tan your ass." 

 "You talked to him? Since then?" 

 "I talk to him at least once a month. Mostly about the issues I have raising a 5 year old girl. We spoke yesterday. He wanted to know if he was going to have to come pick you up and take you home, or if I was going to keep you around." 

 The surprises never stopped coming. Dad and Michael talking. She kissed him again. "Did you come to a decision?" she asked teasing him, rolling her hips. 

 "There was never a question. You were always staying. For Ashley, if nothing else. There was a chance we'd both be miserable, but if that was the price, so be it." The way he said it wasn't playful at all. 

 Jessica stopped moving. "Are you miserable? Did I ruin everything?" 

 He swatted her bottom hard, and she jumped, almost dislodging herself. "No, I'm hardly miserable. I'll probably have a few issues with you for a while. I might say some mean things, and the trust will need some work, but miserable, I'm not. I love you." 

 She leaned down and hugged him. "I'm sorry. If you ever feel the need to get the anger out, I hoped you'll consider taking me to bed, tanning my butt, and screwing my brains out. I'll never complain." 

 He chuckled, giving her rear a playful smack. "It's a hell of an apology. Now giddy-up, cowgirl. You've got some work ahead of you." 

 Her reverie was broken by the sight at the swingset. She had to wipe the condensation off the window, to make sure she was seeing correctly. Ashley was swinging, laughing her little head off, and Dad was pushing her. Her father, there. She dropped the dishes, and ran over to the back door. 

 She saw Ashley hugging her grandfather. Jessica called out to him, but he waved once, and slipped into the woods behind the house. Ashley ran toward the porch. "Grandpa says hi. He tol' me to give you this." 

 Jessica was in shock. She looked at the woods. It was as if he'd never been there. Ashley was hitting her hip, holding the envelope. "How long was he here?" 

 "Only for a little while this time." 

 "This time? He's done this before?" 

 Ashley nodded. "Lots. He says it's a secret. I'm not supposed to tell. Daddy said it was Ok." 

 She took the note from her daughter, trying to understand. Why wouldn't he stop in? 

 After settling her daughter down she sat in front of the fire and read the note. 

 

 

      Dearest Jessie, 

      I may have to disappear for a while. I've done a bad thing. 

      I want you to know that I'm as proud of you today as I ever have      been. I told you, you had a good man, didn't I? 

      You probably are wondering about my spying on you. I hope you      understand, all I wanted to do was see you. It's all I have ever      wanted to do. I don't want to interfere, you need to have your life.      But sometimes the yearning gets to be too much, now that your mother      is gone. So I stop by. I watch. I listen, I snoop. I need to know      what's going on in your life, and without your mother around to give      me updates, I guess I went a little crazy. I hope you can forgive me. 

      I'll stop now. It's probably best if I'm not seen around you anyway,      at least for a while, just in case. 

      Love that husband of yours, and our precious girl. Think of me      sometimes. 

      All my love, always, 

      Daddy 

 

 

 That explains the text messages. They'd continued unabated for a day. Text messages and emails. Then they stopped. Not a peep since. She remembered the story about the neighbors. She should have known. 

 In the envelope was a gift certificate to a year's dancing lessons for two at Arthur Murrays. No explanation. 

 She wiped her eyes, stood and looked out into the woods. He was out there somewhere. Watching over her. Of course. She should have known. He always would. 

 She chuckled for a moment. My father, the stalker. 

 She opened the sliding door, and yelled, "I LOVE YOU, DADDY!" He didn't reply, but she knew that he'd heard her. Even if he was out of earshot. 

 An hour later, she picked her phone up, and called her husband. 

 "Is something wrong?" he asked. She never called during the day. 

 "No. Just the opposite. I love you, and I wanted you to know. You need to clear your Tuesday evenings. We're going dancing." 

 He laughed. "I think I can manage that." 

 "And get home as early as you can. I've got some serious apologizing to do. I've got a new outfit I want you to see. I might even need a spanking," she teased. 

 "Have you been bad, naughty girl?" he asked softly. 

 "I have. I'm touching myself. That's naughty isn't it?" she giggled. 

 "Very naughty. You know, I think I'd like to see that." 

 She felt herself blushing. "You...you'd want to watch me?" 

 "Definitely. Is now too soon? With the holiday shutdown, there's almost nobody around. I could leave in 10 minutes." 

 "Give me an hour. I've got a couple of things to do. I need to drop off Ashley with Jill. Come look for me in the bedroom. I'll be the one with the toys." 

 "You're driving me crazy, Jess," Michael said. 

 "That's the idea, my darling husband. I love you." 

 She hung up the phone, and called her best friend Jill, who was happy enough to take on the task of watching Ashley when she heard why. 

 "Is Donna still doing those sex toy parties?" Jessica asked. 

 Jill laughed. "Seriously? You're thinking of going to one? You?" 

 "Actually, I'm hoping for a private showing. I kind of have an emergency. I told Michael he was going to get a treat when he comes home." 

 "Never mind Donna. I've got two items still in their boxes, from the last one. You're gonna owe me." 

 "Absolutely. You're a lifesaver, Jill." 

 "That's what friends are for. To help and watch out for each other, right?" 

 "Right. See you in a bit." 

 That's what friends are for. Friends and Daddy's.

 Epilogue 

 Dale sat in the seat of honor, at the end of the kitchen island watching the proceedings. His daughter passed him another bowl to dry, which he stacked in front of him. She was so much like her mother, every mannerism a poignant reminder. 

 Jessica spotted another dirty pan beside the range, and maneuvered the battlefield as her husband and daughter worked to get all the dishes completed on time. She had almost made it, when she was suddenly in Michael's arms. He gave her the signal, a little push then a pull, lifting her hand over her head. She spun past him, then back, his hand moving across her lower back, his leg sliding between hers, as she slowly bent backward. 

 Ashley laughed, clapping. 

 Michael pulled his wife upright, snatching a quick kiss before releasing her to her duties. Her son made his feelings clear, with a quick 'Yuck!' before tearing through the kitchen to find his cousins. 

 "The bottom one will cook faster." 

 Michael laughed. "You want to take charge, Dad?" 

 "No way. Too late, I'm not going to take the blame." 

 Ashley ducked under her father's arms, tugging at her grandfather's hands. "Dance with me, Grandpa." 

 Jessica turned up the music. Grandfather and granddaughter came together, with the ease of years of practice. Dale smiled. Ashley was his daughter's clone, tall, beautiful, brilliant, carefree, loving. He grinned, "Did this pretty thing get anything from your side of the family , Michael? She's her mother all over again." 

 Michael turned, with his wife in his arms, "A last name?" 

 Ashley was a much better dancer than him. Not much of a surprise, with a dozen years of dance lessons behind her, and parents who danced like pros. She was graceful, and covered his mistakes smoothly. 

 The music slowed, and Dale guided his granddaughter over, deftly switching partners. His baby girl was in his arms. It was Christmas and everything was right in the world. Well, almost everything. 

 "What's our surprise this year?" she said softly. 

 "What?" 

 "You know. Every year it's something new. You remember. The dance lessons 12 years ago, then scuba lessons, tennis, golf, Tae Kwan Do, sailing, art, you were getting kind of nuts about it. It's like you never wanted us to have a moment free!" 

 "I just wanted my girl happy. As I recall you were bored, once." 

 She blushed. "Not anymore." 

 "That was the idea." He looked to the other end of the room where a sullen young man watched everything going on. "I don't like the looks of him." 

 "Dad, we've done what we could. She's going to make her own decisions." His girl moved her lips to his ear. "He's toast anyway. Michael can't stand him." 

 Dale laughed. "I always knew there was something I liked about that bum you married." 

 "Hey Dad! Seriously, I'm right here!" Michael cried out in mock rage. 

 Dale looked at the man waltzing his daughter over to stir the pot on the stove. "Yes you are. That's a good thing, isn't it?" 

 Michael gazed at his daughter, then at his wife. "There's nowhere I'd rather be in the whole world." 

 "Geez, Dad!" Ashley laughed, pushing him away. "Are you crying? What a wuss!" 

 Jessica turned her father so nobody could see the tears in his eyes. Or the ones in hers. 

 "So is the barrage of lessons over, now that she's graduated?" she asked, pressing her head into his chest. 

 A crash from the living room interrupted their dance. Jessica looked over, and saw her son in the middle of it. "No roughhousing in doors! Take it outside!" she bellowed. 

 She turned around, and he was waving some kind of paper under her nose. She snatched it out of his hand, reading it. 

 "Spanish lessons?" 

 He nodded, as she looked over at her daughter working the range. "Don't let it boil," she called out. 

 "I know, Mom," Ashley replied with a huff, before turning the gas down. 

 "She knows everything," Jessica muttered. "Was I that insufferable?" 

 "To everyone but me," Dale laughed. "I have some serious news. I've decided that I don't want to do the alternating holidays anymore." 

 She looked at him in surprise. Ashley dropped her spoon. Even Michael, ever steady Michael, was shocked. "Crap!" he snapped, sucking on the edge of his hand where he'd touched the edge of the pan, burning himself. 

 "Dad," Jessica said. "I know it's hard but we're trying to be fair. We need to spend some time with Michael's mother, especially now. It's how we've always done it. It's as much a tradition as the turkey and the roast." 

 Dale checked his watch again. She was late. 

 The door burst open and the kids tore into the foyer, "Gramma's here!" 

 Dale gave his daughter a wink, and then Michael was running out of the room, toward his Mom. "Fine!" Dale called after him. "I've got the roast! Momma's boy!" 

 "What are you up to, old man?" Jessica asked, looking at him archly. 

 "I thought it was time to shake things up a bit. Nobody should spend the holidays away from their family." He turned away from his daughter, and took their latest guest in his arms for a hug. When he pressed his lips to hers, you could have heard a pin drop. "You're late," Dale told her. 

 She grinned. "Somebody left a pack of heathens outside. I never thought I'd make it to the door." Michael's mother reached up and ran her fingers through Dale's hair. "You told them?" 

 "Now what kind of surprise would that be?" Dale chuckled. "You want the honors?" 

 "No way you're fobbing this off on me. You started it!" 

 "I made the phone call. As I recall—" her hand over his mouth cut him off. 

 Denise turned to her son, then back to her daughter-in-law. "After Ashley's graduation. Your father and I, well we kind of hit it off—" 

 "More than kind of. The way I remember it—" the hand was back over his mouth. 

 "Hush you!" She turned to her son, "I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. He did raise a heck of a girl." 

 "Benefit of the doubt? C'mon you—" 

 "One more word, Dale, and you'll be sleeping out on the porch!" 

 Ashley laughed. "So tell me Grandma, if he's nice and quiet, where's he get to sleep?" 

 Denise blushed. "I don't think that's any of your business, you little troublemaker." 

 "Seriously Grandma? Did you even think this out? The house is full to the rafters. You're going to be lucky to get a sleeping bag in the attic." 

 "Not so long as I have a bed—" 

 "DALE!" 

 The laughter eventually died down, and Dale pulled Denise back into his arms. "Don't fight it. I'm irresistible you know. You said so yourself." 

 "Damn it, Dale! Are you going out of your way to embarrass me?" 

 "No baby, I'm going out of my way to let everyone know that you're as crazy about me as I am about you." 

 It was a while longer before the chatter quieted. There were a lot of confused looks going around between everyone. Nobody had ever expected that. They lived nearly 700 miles apart after all. He'd been alone for 13 years, dating, but never serious. Her husband had passed away two years earlier, suddenly from a heart attack. They were nothing alike, except for their love of their families. 

 

 "So the Spanish lessons?" Jessica asked. 

 "We figured a June wedding in Buenos Aires. I've always wanted to learn to tango." 

 Jessica laughed. "Never a boring moment with you around, is there Dad?" 

 "Never again."
