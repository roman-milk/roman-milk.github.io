Author's forward – 

 I receive a lot of criticism for the way I end some of my stories. I have lived a long enough life to know that at any given time life hits a fork in the road and it can go one way or another. These forks in the road can happen every few week, every few days, every few minutes or even every few seconds. I often leave my stories at one of these forks in the road so the reader can use his or her imagination to give the story the ending that suits them. I make no apologies for this – it is my way. If the reader lacks the imagination to decide what outcome he or she prefers it is not my problem. 

 And yes, this is my way of letting you know that this is another of those stories.

 The odds on it happening were maybe a million to one. Just guessing there since math never was one of my strong suits, but the odds definitely had to be high. 

 It was at Josie's company picnic. I was sitting in one of the porta-johns scattered around the park where the event was being held when a couple of guys walked up to use one of the other johns. They were laughing and one of them said: 

 "Could you ever be that clueless?" 

 "God I hope not." 

 "What do you think he would do if he knew Josie was in the back of Bill's van with Bill, Sam and Harry?" 

 "Maybe nothing. Maybe he knows what she does and he doesn't care." 

 "I can't believe that. Where is he now?" 

 "Charlie is supposed to be keeping him busy over pitching horseshoes and I'm supposed to get him involved in the volleyball game when they finish tossing shoes." 

 I'd just left Charlie at the horseshoe pits to come and take a quick dump. The talking stopped and I heard the other john door open and close. I sat there and waited and then I heard the door open and a voice say: 

 "Your turn." 

 The door closed and I kept waiting. A few minutes later the door opened and I heard: 

 "You been to the van for your turn yet?" 

 "No way Jose! I don't like sloppy pussy. If I can't be one of the first three I wo..." and his voice faded as they moved away. 

 Fuck no I didn't know, but I damned sure cared. I cracked the door open and peeked out. I saw the backs of the two men walking away. One was wearing a black Harley t-shirt and the other was wearing a green and white polo shirt. I knew who they were, but I didn't really know them. I'd been introduced to them along with a hundred others that I wouldn't see again until Josie's company Christmas party. I would attempt to get to know them better before the day was over and I'd select one of them to have a nice long talk with at a time more convenient to me. 

 I hurried back to the horseshoe pits before anyone started to miss me and wonder where I was. No sense in storming out to the parking lot to interrupt what was already going on. Best to keep looking clueless until I knew more – a lot more – about what my loving wife was up to. 

 Charlie and I had been beaten by two other guys and got out of the way to make room for the new challengers and we were standing there talking when the guy in the Harley t-shirt walked up to us. I remembered that his name was Todd. 

 "You guys doing anything right now?" he asked. "We need a couple more to play volleyball." 

 Charlie said he had promised his wife that he would spend at least a little time with her and the kids and he took off to find her. Knowing that it was Todd's job to keep me occupied I debated making him work for it, but decided not to. Better to be the unconcerned clueless husband for a little while longer. 

 After volleyball Todd and I sat at a picnic table and shot the shit. I asked him about his t-shirt since it was from a dealer in a town in North Carolina and he said he had at least thirty of them from different dealers in the country. 

 "I buy one when I'm out riding and I go into a town where they have a Harley dealer." 

 "You have a sled?" 

 "A 1975 Fat Boy that I rebuilt and restored." 

 "I had a 1986 Triumph Bonneville until I got married. Had to sell it because I couldn't afford a scooter and a car and the wife couldn't see going to the grocery store riding on the pillion." 

 White and green polo shirt joined us and seeing him from the front I remembered his name was Ryan. We sat there and talked bikes, cars and sports for about fifteen minutes until Josie and another girl walked up. Josie didn't look like she had been pulling a train in the parking lot, but maybe she'd been finished long enough to clean up a little and redo her makeup. 

 "The burgers and dogs on the grill are ready" Josie said, "So if you guys are hungry better get it while it's hot." 

 We all got up and headed for the food. As I walked along with Josie I wondered how long she had been cheating on me. I'd have to say that Todd and Ryan were right; I was definitely clueless. I'd not ever had any reason to doubt Josie. I thought that she loved me as much as I loved her and that our marriage was rock solid. There could have been a hundred warning signs that Josie was doing something that she shouldn't be doing, but I'd never have noticed them because it would never have occurred to me that she was doing something she shouldn't. But from what I'd heard while sitting on the toilet she was not only doing something that she shouldn't, but had been doing it for some time. 

 I had to face it. You don't go from loving and faithful wife to pulling trains in a van overnight. You don't go into Thursday night a faithful wife and then suddenly say to your co-workers: 

 "Let's do something different tonight. Let's go out in Bill's van and I'll fuck all of you. Won't that be fun?" 

 I had no idea what I was going to do where Josie was concerned, but when I did it I would do it knowing a hell of a lot more that I did right then. What I did know was when. Josie stopped every Thursday evening after work for drinks with her co-workers. Every other night of the week she got home before I did so it had to be on Thursday night or during her working hours. But then I had to stop and rethink that. I bowled on Monday nights so it could happen then. And on a Saturday or a Sunday I sometimes played golf and was gone for up to six hours. Then there was her every other week visit to her hairdresser. Did I really have any idea how long it took her to get her hair done? She was usually gone four or five hours, but did her only take an hour? Or a half an hour? Or did she do her own hair when she showered after being with whomever? 

 I had done a quick appraisal on both Todd and Ryan while we talked and there was no doubt in my mind that I could take either one of them, but I thought that Ryan would probably be the easiest one to break so Ryan was going to become my font of information. 

 I managed to get through the rest of the day without letting anyone know that Frank wasn't clueless any more. On the way home Josie asked: 

 "Did you have a good time today?" 

 "It wasn't bad." I glanced at her out of the corner of my eye as I said, "It was very informative. I learned a lot about things that I would rather not have known." 

 I saw her face tighten and then she said with a slight catch in her voice: 

 "Like what?" 

 I looked over at her with what I hoped was a blank face and paused a second or so to let her tense up and start to fear the worst and then I said: 

 "Todd talked me into playing volleyball. It almost killed me. I couldn't believe how out of shape I am. I always thought I was pretty fit. I guess I'm going to have to join a gym and start working out. Maybe start jogging again." 

 I saw the tenseness leave her body and she said, "You can't be too out of shape. You have more than enough energy to ring my chimes when we go to bed." 

 "Oh yeah?" I thought. "Then why are you putting out for your co-workers." 

 We showered when we got home. She went first and when she was done and I was taking my turn and soaping myself I wondered what her excuse would be for not making love that night. I was sure that she wouldn't want me feeling how loose her pussy would be – would have to be – after being gang fucked in the back of Bill's van. I was therefore surprised when I came into the bedroom and found her spread out on the bed naked and waiting. 

 This presented a problem for me. Our usual love making sessions started with me going down on Josie and then her pulling me into a sixty-nine after which she would indicate what she wanted – missionary, dog fashion or cowgirl – and then when we were done we would cuddle until one of us indicated a desire to go again or we drifted off to sleep. Going down on Josie knowing that she had been gang fucked earlier did not appeal to me, but not doing the usual would tip Josie off that things were not right. I had to keep her thinking that I was still 'Frank the Clueless' until I knew more and was ready to take steps. I convinced myself that she must have cleaned herself out really good when she showered because she wouldn't want me to feel the residue of her lovers. So I sucked it up (no pun intended) and crawled between her legs and started munching. 

 She didn't seem different to me, but then how would I know how to compare? As I worked on her I wondered how many times I'd done it after she had been on her back (or her hands and knees) with some other guys cock in her and I had to wonder if at those times she had cleaned herself out before we went at it. There was a time or two I thought she was really wet and once I had commented about it and she told me it was because she was super horny that day. According to her a couple of girls she worked with had described their wild weekend over lunch and their descriptions of what they had done had turned Josie on. I was so busy trying to make Josie scream that I didn't ask what the girls had done that had lit Josie's fire. If that was true and that was what really had Josie wet could it be possible that after hearing what they did Josie had decided that she had to experience it also? Is that what led her into the back of Bill's van? I'd probably never know. 

 Josie pushed and prodded me into our usual sixty-nine and then later had me do her doggie. I couldn't tell from eating her pussy that she had been gangbanged and I couldn't tell from fucking her that she had either. How could that be? I could understand her cunt tightening up after a couple of days, but a couple of hours? She came twice before I did and then she surprised me. Instead of snuggling up to cuddle like we usually did when I pulled out of her she spun around, took me in her mouth and went to work on rebuilding my hard on. I lay there wondering what had come over my wife. 

 We had always enjoyed sex and we usually made love three and four times a week, but to spend all afternoon getting banged and then to come home and keep on going? Something had most definitely happened to Josie and I intended to find out what. She did get me back up and the second time she wanted it missionary with her legs up on my shoulders. 

 Sunday was usually a day when we both slept in late unless I had a golf date, but that Sunday Josie woke me up early by fondling my cock until I was awake and then she said: 

 "Give you any ideas?" 

 It did. 

 I spent the day doing yard work and working around the house and wondering if my wife was becoming a nymphomaniac. The only other explanation that I could come up with is that she was feeling guilty over cheating on me and was trying to assuage her guilt. Sunday night was a repeat of Saturday night and I fell asleep exhausted. 

 +++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I told my boss that I suspected that my wife was cheating on me or was about to and I asked if I could work through my coffee breaks and lunch period so I could leave early and be in place to follow her when she got off work. 

 "I've been there son and I know what you are going through. Take what ever time off you need and don't worry about your breaks and lunch period. I won't dock you any time." 

 I was parked up the street from where Josie worked ten minutes before her quitting time, but I wasn't there to follow Josie; I was there to follow Ryan. I followed him for two days and each day he stopped to have dinner at a Denny's and then went straight home. I checked out his apartment complex and figured out the best way to do what I was going to do. I didn't follow him on Wednesday night; I was at his apartment complex waiting for him to get home. I was behind one of the pillars that supported the staircase up to the second and third floors and when he put his key in his door and started to open it I came out from my hiding place. Five quick steps and I was behind Ryan and I put my shoulder into his back and sent him staggering into his apartment. I followed him in and kicked the door shut behind me. He recovered quickly and came at me and we exchanged blows. For a second or two I thought that I might have chosen wrong, but then I caught him a good one on the chin and it dazed him just enough that I could knee him in the crotch and he folded. 

 I took the zip ties out of my back pocket and secured his hands and feet and then I muscled him up onto his couch. I put and hand under his chin, lifted his head until I could look him in the eyes and then I said: 

 "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. You can answer my questions freely or I'll beat the answers out of you, but either way I won't be leaving here until I'm satisfied that I know everything that I want to know. Do you understand what I'm saying?" 

 He nodded a yes and then I told him that I had been in the portable toilet when he and Todd had walked up and I'd heard what they said. 

 "So what I want to know is how long has it been going on, when and how did it start and who all is involved. So start talking." 

 "It started about two months ago and it involves all of us in our section except Josie and Fred. Fred is newly married and won't cheat on his wife and while Josie wants to join in she says she can't without you being okay with it. She just doesn't know how to bring it up to you. That's what the deal was at the picnic. Todd and I saw you go into the john and then we walked over and said what we said. You were supposed to come out of the toilet and go storming down to the van." 

 "That doesn't make any sense. She won't do it unless I said it was okay, but I'm supposed to run down to the van, jerk open the door and catch her doing it?" 

 "You wouldn't have caught her doing anything except playing cards with Sue, Marge and Billie." 

 "You are making this up as you go along right? Do you have any idea how stupid this sounds?" 

 I drew back to smack him and he said, "I know it sounds stupid. It sounded stupid to me when Josie told me her plan and I told her how dumb it sounded, but she was pretty sure that it would work. You were supposed to go to the van, pull open the door and then stand there dumbfounded as the four girls looked at you and then Josie was going to say: 

 "What? You look like you expected to find something else?" 

 "Then one of the others would say, "Well, we all know what Bill uses this van for" and Josie would look at you and say "Is that what this is about? You expected me to be in here with Bill? Well he is a hunk and it might have been fun" and then Billie would say "He is a hunk and he is damned good in the sack. You ought to give him a try." 

 I looked at him as if he was from outer-space and he caught the look and said: 

 "I know, I know; dumb, really dumb. Anyway then Marge was going to say "If you do Bill I have first dibs on your hubby" then Sue was going to say "I'm next after Marge" and Billie would say, "Oh no you guys don't. We draw for who gets him first." Then Josie was going to say "How about it Frank? You want a taste of Sue, Billie and Marge? Should I go and get Bill?" 

 "You can't be serious." 

 "Not my plan man. I just played my part. I didn't think it had a prayer of working, but Josie was sure that if you knew you could tap Marge, Billie and Sue without Josie getting pissed off at you you would go for it. There wasn't any Plan B if you didn't take the bait and go storming down to the van. All I know is that the girls are working on another plan." 

 "Go back to the beginning. How did it start and how did Josie get involved?" 

 "You won't believe me if I tell you. Hell, I was there and I still have trouble believing it." 

 "Try me." 

 "It started during one of our Thursday nights after work. Up until that night all we had done was have a few drinks, bad mouth management and maybe dance a little to the juke box. But what made that night different was that Charlie had left work early for a doctor's appointment. He saw his doctor and then went to the bar to wait for the rest of us. Charlie can get a bit loud and pushy when he gets a snoot full and that night he had a two hour head start on the rest of us. 

 "Maybe an hour after we got there Charlie and Billie got up to dance. When they came back to the table and sat down Charlie shocked us when he said out loud to Billie: 

 "I want to fuck you so bad I can taste it.' 

 'Then Billie stunned us when she said, "Okay. You taste it and if you do a good enough job with your tongue I'll let you fuck me." Then she looked around the table and said, "As long as I'm in the mood anyone else want some?" Bill said, "Hell yes and we can use my van" and the three of them went outside to the parking lot. What none of us knew at the time was that Billie had just found out that her husband was fucking his secretary every day on their lunch hour and Billie was thinking about revenge when Charlie said what he said. Anyway, about ten minutes after the three of them left Mike got up and said "I've just got to see this" and he went outside. None of the four were back by the time the rest of us had to go home, but Bill's van was still in the parking lot when we left." 

 "How does Josie figure into that?" 

 "She doesn't, at least not then." 

 "Go on." 

 "The next day at work during morning coffee break Bill, Charlie and Mike told the rest of us what happened in the van." 

 He stopped there and I told him to finish it. 

 "When they got into the van Billie pulled her skirt up to her waist, took off her panties and layed back on the mattress. Bill was the first to get his pants off and he went to climb on top of Billie, but she pushed him away and told him that the deal was Charlie had to eat her pussy before anyone got to fuck her. Charlie got down between her legs and started eating her and Bill moved up and pushed his cock at her face. She tried to avoid it, but he grabbed her head and pushed his cock in her mouth. Once he was in she started sucking him. After several minutes Charlie pulled his head out of her pussy and started fucking her and when he came Bill took his place. While Bill was banging her Charlie stuck his cock in her mouth so she could suck him hard again. While that was going on Mike joined them. He watched for a bit and then undressed. Before they were done they had three-holed Billie a couple of times." 

 "Three-holed?" 

 "Yeah, you know; a cock in her mouth, pussy and ass at the same time." 

 "I still don't see where Josie comes into to this." 

 "Sometime during the day the girls got together and Billie told them about what went on in the van and she told them that she had loved it and was already looking forward to the next Thursday. For the next week that's all anyone talked about and on the next Thursday when Billie asked who was going out to the van with her Todd and I jumped up and said it was our turn. The three of us went out to the van, but before we could get started everyone was there wanting to watch. There were too many of us so we all chipped in and got a motel room. 

 "The room had two beds and me, Todd and Billie got on one of them and the others stood around and watched or sat on the other bed and watched as I fucked Billie while she sucked off Todd. I finished and Todd took my place and I took his place in her mouth. By the time Todd got his rocks off Sue and Charlie were naked and fucking on the other bed and Bill and Marge were going at it on the bed next to them.

"Josie had her panties off and was finger fucking herself while watching the action. Phil undressed and walked up to her and tried to pull her fingers out of her pussy so he could fuck her, but she wouldn't let him. I was busy trying to work my cock into Sue's ass so I lost track of what was going on between Josie and Phil, but the next time I looked their way they were kissing and Phil was finger fucking her while she was jacking him off. That's all she did though. It was the same for the next three weeks. She would let you suck her tits and finger fuck her and she would give you a hand job, but that is all she would do. She wanted to join in and once she was even on her hands and knees getting ready to suck Charlie's cock, but at the last minute she pulled back, said she couldn't and just jacked him off." 

 "That's it?" 

 "That's all I know about. I know Billie and Sue have gotten together with Charlie and Bill on nights other than Thursday, but I don't know about any of the others." 

 I cut the wraps loose and then said, "This little talk never took place. If I find out that you have mentioned it to anyone I'll burn you. You and Todd are the only single ones in the group so if I find out you have told anyone about this I'll make sure the husbands and wives of the others find out about what has been going on and I'll make sure that everyone knows the information came from you. Got it?" 

 He nodded a yes and I left his apartment. As I drove home I had the answers to at least two of my questions. I know knew why Josie's sexual appetites were fired up and I knew why she had been so wet the times I'd noticed. She was wet from getting off on some one's fingers. I was not at all happy with my bride. She might not consider having another man's hands on and in her body and his mouth on hers and on her tits as infidelity. She might not feel she was cheating as long as actual fucking didn't take place, but I didn't see it the same way. Granted, her body was hers to do with what she liked, but when she said "I do" she had given me exclusive rights. I didn't yet know what I was going to do, but I was not happy. I was not happy in the least. And there was something else. Something about my talk with Ryan didn't ring right, but I couldn't put my finger on it, but it would come to me eventually. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Josie was hot to trot that night; probably in anticipation of what she would be watching the next night. Or maybe actually participating in if she were to give up on involving me or somehow getting my approval. 

 Thursday morning I decided to throw some shit into the game. Over breakfast I said: 

 "I think I'll swing by and join you at the bar after work tonight. I had a pretty good time at the picnic with Todd and Ryan and I think I'd like to get to know them a little better." 

 I didn't say "Would you mind" or "Would it be all right with you" I just flat out told her I was going to be there and then waited to see what she would do. She didn't sound too enthused when she said: 

 "That would be nice. I'd like for you to get to know the guys I work with a little better." 

 As I drove to work I was thinking that there would be some interesting conversations in her office that day. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 It was maybe an hour after lunch and I was sitting on the toilet in the bathroom when what I had been thinking about on my way home from my talk with Ryan came back to me and I realized what it was that bothered me. What he'd said was too 'practiced' if that is the word I was looking for. It was almost like he was reciting from a script. Well practiced and memorized. Done well, I'd have to admit that, but just enough 'off' to plant something in my mind. I was going to have to do some more digging. 

 I left work early and hit Wal-Mart. They had a digital voice operated recorder that had a thirty-seven hour capacity and I bought two of them. Next stop was Radio Shack (I bought the recorders at Wally World because they were cheaper there) where I bought a lapel microphone with a cord that would plug into the recorder and a package of alligator clips. Then I headed over to where Josie worked. I watched her and her co-workers leave and then I went around the building to the loading dock. Josie's company had the third and fourth floors and they got off at five. The company that had the first and second floors was open twenty-four/seven and I knew the loading dock wouldn't be locked. 

 I was taking a gamble that I thought no one would expect me to take. I went through the loading dock hoping not to be noticed, but not really worried if I was. I had come through it once before and when the loading dock foreman had seen me and asked who I was and what I was doing there I told him I was there to surprise my wife. It was her birthday and I was going to take her out for a night on the town. If I got stopped I'd give a similar story. 

 No one saw me and I made my way up to the third floor. I crossed my fingers and hoped that everyone was gone from the office and then I went in. The floor seemed quiet and I quickly moved to Josie's work area. It took a few minutes to find a suitable hiding place for the recorder. From its hiding place it would be able to record anything said around Josie's desk and it would pick up her side of any phone conversations. If it were to be found by accident no one would be able to connect it to me. I got out of the building and as far as I knew no one had seen me. 

 I drove over to the bar and joined my wife and three of her coworkers – Todd, Ryan and Sue. Three guesses as to where the others were. As I sat down at the table with them I wondered if Ryan had talked and that Josie, Todd and Sue knew that I knew what they had been up to. They didn't show it if they did. 

 Todd, Ryan and I talked motorcycles and took turns dancing with Sue and Josie until it was time to head on home. Todd, Ryan and Sue were still there when Josie and I left and I wondered if they had enough time to get in a quick one with Sue before she had to get home to her husband and kids. 

 That night for the first Thursday in a month Josie didn't come after me when we went to bed. I took that to be further proof that our increased sex life was fed by either guilt or the excitement of what she had been doing. When she didn't make the move I did just to see if she would put me off. She didn't, but the wild unrestrained passion of the previous Thursdays wasn't there and there was no morning sex either. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 I left for work at my usual time and drove a couple of blocks away and waited to give Josie time to get out of the house and head to work and then I went back home. Out of my toolbox in the garage I got my wire cutters and wire strippers. I cut the microphone off of the wires it was attached to, stripped the wires and put alligator clips on them. I plugged the cord into the recorder and then went down to the basement and found the phone wires where they came into the house. I stripped the outer casing off the phone line exposing the four wires inside. I ignored the black and white wires and stripped the coating off of the red and yellow ones. I attached the alligator clips to the bare wires and then I went up to the kitchen, took out my cell phone and called the house phone. The phone rang and I answered it, said "Testing, testing" and then hung up. I went back down to the basement and checked the recorder and saw that the counter had advanced. I rewound it, hit play and heard "Testing, testing" and then I rewound it again and headed off to work. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got home from work that evening Josie had dinner ready and she gave no indication that she suspected that I knew anything about what she had been up to. I remembered Ryan saying that Josie and the other women in the group were working on a new plan and I wondered what it was and when they would put it into play. There was no sex on Friday night and I was up and out of the house by seven to meet three friends for a round of golf. I would get home around two and since Josie was usually up by eight on Saturday she would have six hours without me around and maybe she would use some of that time to talk to her co- conspirators or for all I knew invite them over. 

 My game suffered that morning because I couldn't concentrate on it. I kept thinking about the situation with Josie and wondering what might be on the digital recorder when I checked it. I got home a little after two and Josie was in the basement doing laundry so I couldn't get to the recorder and then it was time to get ready to go to her Cousin Laurie's birthday party. I had to wait until Josie went shopping Sunday afternoon before I could get to the recorder. There were several calls I had to skip through to get to the one that was interesting. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hi, it's me. Is he there? Can you talk?" 

 "Yes. He's out golfing." 

 "I'm dying of curiosity. Anything new to report?" 

 "No. Why would there be?" 

 "You mean he still hasn't said anything?" 

 "No. I'm watching him close and so far he hasn't let on that he knows." 

 "Have you decided what you are going to do?" 

 "About what?" 

 "About Thursday nights." 

 "You already know I'm not going to do anything until I can find a way to talk to Frank about things." 

 "Why are you playing games girlfriend? You want to do it. You know you want to do it." 

 "I won't be unfaithful to Frank and I've told all you guys that." 

 "Get real Josie. You already have been unfaithful. Phil, Charlie and Mike have all had their cocks halfway down your throat. Just because you haven't given up your pussy doesn't mean that you are still true to your hubby." 

 "That's not the way I see it Sue. My pussy and ass are Frank's and no one else's unless he says I can let someone else have them." 

 "Bull hocky girlfriend. The only reason you can still say that is because Marge and Billie pulled Todd off of you the last time we were all together." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "You were so into giving Phil a blow job that you weren't paying any attention to anything else. You were on your knees gobbling Phil's dick and your ass was up in the air and waving and Todd stepped up behind you. He had his hands on your hips and a half inch of cock into you when Marge and Billie pulled him off. He had his cock starting in you and you never even noticed. I'd bet everything I have that if Frank hadn't interfered Thursday and you had gone to the motel with the rest of the guys you would have been on your back with three of them in you before you went home. The truth is that you want to do it, but are afraid to bring it up to Frank and it is going to happen whether you bring it up to him or not. Either talk to Frank and get him on board or quit stopping with the group because if you keep stopping it will happen whether you want it to or not." 

 There was a second or two of silence and then Josie said, "Todd really had his cock in me?" 

 "Just enough to start parting your lips. A half second more and he would have been all the way in." 

 "And I never noticed?" 

 "You weren't concentrating on anything except seeing how much of Phil's cock you could swallow." 

 "Well it is a pretty nice cock" Josie said and Sue laughed. 

 "Oh yes indeed it is girlfriend and the fact that you just said that is all the proof I need that with or without Frank's blessings you are going to become a full fledged member of the group and soon. I'd bet on the coming Thursday. Hey! Got to go. Hubby just pulled into the garage." 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 As I walked back up the stairs my mind was in a huge tangle. I loved Josie. I loved her enough that I would have died to save her if it ever came to that, but loving her or not there were some things a man just could not tolerate, I wasn't at all happy with the finger fucking and kissing and hand jobs, but I figured I could work by them. But blow jobs? That was a different breed of cat and I didn't know that our marriage could survive that. 

 I didn't know if I could compose myself enough to face Josie right then so I went outside and busied myself doing yard work. I was cutting the grass when Josie got home and I went from that to pulling weeds out of the flower beds. I was washing my car when Josie called me in for dinner and then I did my best to keep up my end of the dinner conversation. After dinner I went out into the garage and found things to do to keep me busy and keep me from going into the house and having to be with my wife. 

 Eventually however bedtime was upon me and I went into the house, up to the bedroom and then into the shower. When I came out I found a naked Josie waiting for me on the bed and for the first time ever I told Josie that I wasn't feeling well. I could see that she was stunned by that, but I ignored her, slid under the covers and rolled onto my side with my back to her. After some hesitation she snuggled up against my back and I fell into a fitful sleep.

 In the morning I was up and out of the house before Josie woke up and I spent most of the day at work not getting anything done as my thoughts on the situation with Josie rolled over and over in my head. By quitting time I still had no clear idea of what I was going to do. I did know that I needed to get my head out of my ass and get back to acting natural if I wanted to keep Josie confused. It was obvious from the conversation between Josie and Sue that Ryan had informed Josie and probably the entire group that he had blown the whistle on them and that Josie now knew that I knew. She had to be on pins and needles waiting to see what I was going to do and I wanted to keep her on that edge. To do that I had to act natural and keep on pretending I was "Frank the Clueless." That meant that if she offered pussy I needed to take it. But even at that there were limits. I would not be kissing the mouth that had sucked Phil's, Mike's and Charlie's cocks and let her think what she wanted to about that. 

 I left work early and was waiting when Josie and her bunch left work. I went in through the loading dock and up to Josie's desk and retrieved the digital recorder and once again I was sure that I hadn't been seen. I played the recorded as I drove home. There was a bunch of work stuff that I wasn't interested in and then it got to a place where I was. Once again it was Sue talking to Josie. 

 "What happened when you left?" 

 "Nothing." 

 "He didn't say anything? Do anything?" 

 "Not a word. He is acting like he doesn't know." 

 "You couldn't tell that he knows?" 

 "No, he hasn't shown a thing." 

 "I don't believe it. How could he not show something after Ryan told him everything?" 

 "I don't know, but maybe it was because Ryan didn't tell him everything." 

 "What do you mean by that?" 

 "Remember that we coached the guys not to mention the blow jobs if Frank came after any of them? We told them to only tell about the fingering and hand jobs. Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe he is still thinking about things. Maybe it is a case of Frank not being all that upset over what little Ryan told him and he is still trying to make up his mind about what to do. Maybe if Ryan had told him about the blow jobs he would be reacting differently. I'm hoping that the fact he hasn't confronted me means that he is thinking about doing what I hoped we could steer him into with the van setup. Maybe he is trying to talk himself into it. All I know is that I'm not going to do anything. He knows, I know he knows and I'm going to let him run with it and see what he does." 

 "Is that safe?" 

 "If he was going to go off on me he would have done it by now." 

 "What was he trying to do last night?" 

 "I don't know. I hoped he was going to bring it up with us and maybe indicate he wanted to be a part of it, but he didn't so maybe all it was was a way to keep me from being in the motel with the rest of the guys." 

 "So that's it? Wait and see?" 

 "Yep; wait and see." 

 There was a lot more on the recorder, but it all had to do with work. There were some sounds that I took to be the cleaning crew moving around in the office that evening or over the weekend and then some good mornings and how were your weekends. A couple of business related talks and then Sue and Josie again. 

 After an exchange of good mornings Sue asked, "Everything still the same?" 

 "As a matter of fact no. For the first time ever Frank wouldn't make love to me. I was ready and he turned his back on me." 

 "That isn't a good sign." 

 "No it isn't." 

 "What are you going to do?" 

 "What can I do? I just have to wait and see what happens." 

 "Yeah, but what are you thinking? You going to give up on Thursdays or just keep things going the way they are and hope?" 

 "I don't know Sue; I really don't know." 

 Just then Josie's phone rang and the rest of what was on the recorder was all work related. 

 Josie had dinner ready when I got home and we both acted as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Josie asked me if I was feeling better and I told her that I was. 

 "I think it was just a mild touch of stomach flu." 

 She smiled and said, "You left me horny last night and I've been carrying it around with me all day. Think you can help me out tonight?" 

 "I wouldn't be the bit surprised." 

 I helped her with the dishes and then we watched some TV until bed time. Once again Josie was naked and waiting for me when I came out of the shower and I crawled between her spread legs and started eating her pussy. She moved into a sixty-nine and we went at each other for about five minutes and then she pulled away from me and swung over me and rode me cowgirl style. After we had both gotten off she went down on me and got me hard again and that time she wanted me to "puppy fuck" her which is what she called dog fashion. It took a supreme effort on my part to keep it up as I remembered her Saturday conversation with Sue where I heard that she was on her knees ass up sucking Phil's cock while Todd was getting ready to do her doggie. I managed to get the job done and Josie snuggled up against me and we fell asleep.

 Tuesday and Wednesday passed with the two of us giving Academy Award performances as two people who had no secrets from each other. We did make love Wednesday night and when we were done and snuggled up I wondered if she had noticed that I hadn't kissed her in over four days. I had spent the time since hearing the Saturday conversation doing an awful lot of soul searching and by Wednesday evening I had decided what I was going to do. 

 I did love Josie and I loved her so much that I couldn't make a decision on my own so I took the cowards way out and dumped the decision onto her. 

 I woke up early Thursday morning and set the scene and then I left the house and headed out. I stopped at a Waffle House for breakfast and then went on into work. When Josie got up and came down to the kitchen to get her first cup of coffee she would find the kitchen table set for her. In the middle of the table she would find three sheets of paper. On her left the paper was a list of the names of the people she worked with. On the right was a blank sheet of paper with my wedding ring sitting in the middle of it. Between the two sheets the third piece of paper sat with only two words in big block letters on it. 

 "Your choice." 

 I would have my answer when I got home from work. She would either be home...or she wouldn't. Report_Story
