Fifty-Three Dollars
===================

===

Looking back on it I realize that I should have known how it was going to turn out. Back then the little head was in charge and I more or less followed its lead. 

 The little head was like a piece of steel and she was like a magnet that constantly pulled the little head to her. Just the way I met Monica told me everything that I should have needed to know, but the big head needs blood to operate just as the little head needs blood to inflate and Monica kept the little head inflated which kept the blood away from where it was needed most. 

 I met Monica when I stopped at King Soopers to get the makings for dinner. It was a Sunday and as I was walking from the parking lot to the store I noticed a woman pulling a shopping cart from a line of them. She was wearing tight jeans and high heels and I have no idea why, but a woman who wears high heels with jeans grabs my attention. 

 I hurried to get a cart and follow her into the store. I noticed that she filled out her Levis quite nicely and I was so busy looking at her ass and her sexy feet in her heels that I almost ran into her with my cart. I stopped in time and when I raised my eyes I saw that she had a tattoo that covered her entire back. Or at least I thought it did. Her top covered a lot of it, but I could see it just above her tops neckline and I could see some of it coming out of the arm holes on either side. 

 Her tight Levis and her high heels were already pulling the blood away from the big head and that is the only excuse that I have for what happened next. 

 "Excuse me" I said, "But I have a question for you." 

 She turned to face me and I saw that her face was just as sexy looking as the rest of her body. 

 "And that question would be" she asked. 

 "How much would it cost me to get you to take off your top so I could see the entire tattoo?" 

 She laughed and looked around. "Here? In the store? In front of God and everybody? I guess I could do it for a thousand dollars." 

 She saw the look on my face and said, "What? You don't think I'm worth a grand?" 

 "I'm sure that you are probably worth a lot more than that, but that is way out of my price range." 

 "And just what is your price range?" 

 "I won't insult you by mentioning it." 

 "Oh no you don't buster. You started this. How much are you willing to pay?" 

 "I don't honestly know. I never expected to be having this conversation. I thought you would probably say something like "You don't have enough and never will have enough." 

 "What if I would have said that I'd do it for whatever you have on you? What would I have gotten?" 

 "Fifty-three dollars and some loose change." 

 "No way. Not here in the store. Not for that little." 

 She started to move away and when she turned her leg touched my iron bar hard cock and she stopped, looked at me and said: 

 "Oh my. Did I do that?" 

 She got a guilty grin and a shrug from me. 

 "You are kinda cute" she said and then went on to say, "Fifty-three dollars huh? Not here in the store, not for fifty-three bucks, but give me a call in about an hour" and she took a card out of her purse and handed it to me. "Maybe we can work something out. Use the cell number" and then she pushed her cart toward the deli counter. I watched her walk away and the little head throbbed as I watched her ass move in those tight Levis. I looked at the card and saw that her name was Monica Ensign and that she worked for a real estate company. It gave two phone numbers (one her cell), a fax number and an email address. I put the card in my shirt pocket fully intending to give Monica Ensign a call. 

 I didn't have my checkbook with me and as I watched Monica walk away I decided not to spend my fifty-three dollars on groceries. I left my empty cart there in the produce section and headed for home. I showered, put on clean clothes and checked my watch. It had been an hour and five minutes since Monica Ensign had given me her card. I took my phone of the charger and made the call. 

 "Hello?" 

 "I never gave you my name, but I'm the guy who really, really wanted to see your tattoo and by the way my name is Rob." 

 "I'm surprised. I really didn't expect you to call. I thought you were just running a line on me." 

 "You hand your phone number out to any guy you think is just shooting you a line?" 

 "No, but I did say that you were kinda cute. Just what did you expect to get out of this call?" 

 "No idea, but you did tell me to call you in an hour so I guess I was hoping that you had something in mind." 

 "I did. I was curious to see if you would really pay me to see my tat." 

 "You bet I would." 

 "Okay, but it will cost you." 

 "How much?" 

 "Fifty-three dollars and you have to take me out to dinner." 

 "I can do that. When?" 

 "No time like the present. Do you know where the Castle View Apartments are?" 

 "I do." 

 "I'm in apartment 15 E. That's in the E building. How long before I can expect you?" 

 "A minute. Maybe a minute and a half." 

 "A minute? Where are you now?" 

 "Apartment 22 in the B building." 

 I made it in a minute fifteen. She answered the door in the same Levis and heels, but she had on a different top and it didn't expose any of her tattoo. 

 "Just let me grab my purse and I'm ready to go." 

 On the way to my pickup she asked me where I was taking her and I told her that it was her choice. She opted for Angelina's and over Veal Scaloppini (me) and Linguini with Clam Sauce (her) we traded our vital statistics. Twenty-four year old single mom – daughter with grandma and grandpa for the weekend – office manager for a real estate firm, avid bowler (two mixed and one women's house league) with a one seventy-six average. Loved classical music and read an average of two books a week (currently had nine checked out of the library) and loved to cook. 

 On my part she found out that I was a single twenty-six year old logistics manager for a national freight company who also bowled (but only in one men's house league) and carried (embarrassed to tell her after hearing hers) a one fifty-five average. My music was country western and I rarely read, never watched TV and restored cars in my spare time. My current project was a 1993 Mustang convertible. That last fact peaked her interest. She also drove a Mustang convertible. A 1997. 

 "Black with a black top?" 

 "Yep." 

 "I've seen it in the parking lot and I wondered whose it was." 

 "It was my husband's and I got it by default when he got his dumb ass killed." 

 "Not a happy marriage?" 

 "It was fine until I got pregnant with Melanie. He didn't want kids and had made that point very forcibly before we got married. When my birth control pills let me down he said that he wasn't going to be saddled with a brat and he took off. He joined the Army and the fool let the recruiter talk him into going Airborne. I never got the full story, but on his third training jump something went wrong with his main chute and he either panicked and forgot he had a reserve chute or something went wrong with that too. Whatever. It was a closed casket funeral. What's the story with you? Twenty-six years old and single?" 

 "Twenty-six years old and widowed. Some similarities to your story. I wanted kids and she didn't. After two years of constantly bugging me –unsuccessfully – to get a vasectomy so she could go off the pill she up and left me. Told me to fuck off and die and went storming out of the house. She was so pissed at me that she wasn't paying attention and she ran a red light and got T-boned by a beer truck. Also a closed casket funeral." 

 "Why didn't you give her what she wanted?" 

 "Because I wanted kids. I didn't know that vasectomies could be reversed and I thought that some day she might change her mind and I needed to be functional if that happened. The irony of the situation is that it didn't matter because it turns out that I'm sterile and couldn't have fathered a child anyway." 

 "How did you find that out?" 

 "A sad tale, but the short version is that a girl I was dating said she was pregnant and that I was the father. I knew that she wasn't exclusive with me and I didn't believe her. I told her that if a DNA test showed that I was the father I would marry her otherwise no. The test proved that I wasn't the father. Three months later at a party I was drinking with an old girlfriend who asked where Sally was and so I told her the story. She said that she could have told me that I wasn't the father without even bothering to do a DNA test. I asked her how she could say that. She told me that she had never been on the pill and we had done it dozens of times when she was at her most fertile and I'd never gotten her pregnant so I probably wasn't able to do it. Since I did want kids I thought I'd better check things out and that's when I found out I was shooting blanks. If I want kids I'm going to have to marry a woman who already has them." 

 When I got her home she invited me in, had me sit down on the couch and then she offered me a beer. When she brought it to me she handed it to me and said: 

 "That will be fifty-three dollars please" and stood there and held her hand out until I took the money out of my pocket and handed it to her. She walked over to her purse and put the money in it and then came back to stand in front of me. She took off her top and then did a slow turn in front of me. 

 "What do you think? Worth the price?" 

 "No. You are cheating me." 

 "Cheating? How am I cheating?" 

 "I paid to see the whole tattoo and your bra is covering part of it." 

 "Oh no you don't buster. You paid for me to take my top off. You never said a word about the brassiere." 

 "My exact words in the store were "How much will it cost me to get you to take off your top so I can see the entire tattoo." The intent was to see the entire tattoo. On the phone earlier you told me fifty-three to see that tat and no mention was made of removing the top only. You told me that you wanted to see if I would actually pay to see the tattoo. The deal was that I got to see the entire tattoo." 

 "Okay then. I guess we will have to work out a compromise. I'll take the bra off, but you will have to take off you pants and underwear." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because you want to see my tattoo and I want a look at what you were poking into my leg on Saturday." 

 My immediate thought was that "If my cock is out I just might to get to use it." It was a no-brainer and I started unbuckling my belt. As I pulled my zipper down Monica unfastened her bra and shrugged it off. Her bra hit the floor at the same time as my trousers and boxers and of course by then the little head had all of the available blood and my cock was sticking straight out where Monica could get a good look at it. 

 Monica did a slow turn in front of me and I saw the entire tattoo, but I also got to see what the bra had covered. Monica's tits were fantastic! I wasn't much of an expert on breasts, but I guessed that they were 36's and they were cone shaped and struck straight out from her chest like the nose cones of rockets. 

 "Well" Monica asked, "What do you think?" 

 "They are fantastic." 

 "They? It's only one tattoo." 

 "What tattoo? I'm talking about your breasts. They are magnificent," 

 "You faker! You never wanted to see my tat! It was my tits all along." 

 "No it wasn't. Your tops, both the one you were wearing in the store and the one you were wearing tonight were loose and I couldn't even tell what kind of tits you might have." 

 She looked at my cock pointing at her and said, "I guess you must like them if they do that to you." 

 She went to her knees in front of me and took my cock in her mouth. After about a minute she stood up and leaving her heels on she took off her jeans and thong and as she was stepping out of them she told me to hurry up and get the rest of my clothes off. I rapidly complied and then she led me to her bedroom. She pulled down the bed covers and as she did she asked me how long had it been since I'd gotten my last piece. I told her about a month and she said: 

 "That's too long. You are going to get off too quick and I don't want that." 

 She pushed me down on the bed and then she went down on me and sucked me until I came. She was right. It was pretty quick. She swallowed it all and then kept on going until I was hard again and then she got down on the bed and spread her legs. She was expecting me to just climb on and go and seemed surprised when I buried my face in her pussy (which was clean shaven by the way) and started lapping away. I stayed on her honey pot (I know that is what it was because just above it was a tat that said "Honey pot" with an arrow pointing down at it) until I gave her an orgasm and then I moved up and pushed into her. 

 "Fuck me hard" she moaned as I bottomed out and then I did what she wanted. I fucked her as hard as I was able while her nails dug into my butt cheeks as she tried to pull me even closer. She came twice before I got mine and I stayed on top of her until my cock went limp and then I pulled out and fell to the bed beside her. 

 I lay there trying to catch my breath and she reached down and started fondling my limp dick. After a bit it twitched and she laughed and said: 

 "Oh goody; I think he wants to play some more." 

 She scooted down, took me in her mouth and worked on me until I was up and ready to play. 

 "Ready to complete the hat trick" she asked. 

 "Hat trick? What is that?" 

 "Not a hockey fan? When a player scores three goals it is called a hat trick. That's in hockey. My version of a hat trick is when my guy comes in all three of my holes. You have already cum in my mouth and my honey pot so that leaves one more to go." 

 "You mea...." 

 "That is exactly what I mean" she said as she got on her hands and knees. 

 I had never done anal. I had always wanted to try, but every woman I had ever been with had said "No way Jose" so Monica was going to be my first. 

 I liked it! Oh yes in-fucking-deed I liked it. 

 It was obvious that Monica liked it too from the way she pushed her ass back at me and cried out "Yes, yes, yes." She had another orgasm before I sent my load deep into her and pulled out. I was breathing hard as she rolled over on her back, looked up at me and asked: 

 "You got any more in you?" 

 "Maybe one more" I gasped and she said, "Good! Be right back" and she got off the bed and left the room. She came back a minute later with a soapy rag and a towel. She washed and dried my cock, dropped the rag and towel on the floor and then went down on me again. It took her a while, but she did get me up. 

 "Where do you want to put it this time?" 

 "Heaven" I said and she got on her hands and knees. As I pushed my cock into her ass I was reading the tattoo on her back that said, "Gateway to Heaven" with an arrow that pointed to where I was going. She had one more orgasm before I got mine and I knew I was done for the night when I pulled my dick out of her butt. 

 I got off the bed and was heading for the living room to get my clothes when Monica said: 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "I'm done babe! I've got nothing left to give." 

 "Get your butt back here. You don't get to do what you've done to me and then leave without giving me some cuddle time." 

 "You will need to set your clock for six then. Tomorrow is a work day for me." 

 "It is for me too and the clock is all ready set for five forty-five." 

 I climbed back on the bed with her; she snuggled up next to me and in only minutes I was in dreamland. 

 The clock went off and I woke up to Monica snuggled up against me. As I moved her eyes opened and she said: 

 "Good morning lover. Time for a wake up quickie?" 

 "Not if I'm going to get to work on time and my boss is a stickler for punctuality." 

 "I don't think I like him" she said as she got out of bed. 

 When I was dressed and ready to leave Monica walked me to the door, kissed me and then said: 

 "I'll pay you fifty-three dollars to come back this evening." 

 I was going to say no? 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 That evening she answered the doorbell naked and with the money in her hand. The evening was a repeat of the night before and in the morning as I was getting ready to leave I said: 

 "I'll give you fifty-three dollars if I can come back tonight." 

 I wasn't surprised when she said that she would take the deal. For the next three days the money went back and forth between us until Saturday. 

 "I'm sorry lover, but Melanie comes home tomorrow afternoon so I am going to have to start behaving like a mommy again." 

 "Mommy's can date can't they?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Then use the fifty-three dollars to help pay for babysitters. What is the next night that will work for you?" 

 "I can make it Tuesday." 

 "It's a date." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Tuesday evening I met six year old Melanie and she stole my heart. Monica introduced us and I put out my hand and said: 

 "Pleased to meet you Miss Melanie." 

 She took my hand and as she shook it she said, "You're nice. Are you my mommy's friend? Mommies need friends." 

 I smiled and said, "I'm trying really hard to be your mommy's best friend." 

 "I like you. Do you like him too mommy?" 

 "He's growing on me sweetie." 

 Just then the baby sitter showed up and after some last minute instructions regarding Melanie Monica and I left to go to dinner. 

 Once out of her apartment "Where to" I asked expecting her to name the restaurant and she giggled and said, "The B Building." 

 "I haven't been shopping yet and there isn't much there to eat." 

 "There will be when we get there." 

 I can be a tad slow sometimes, but I got what she was saying pretty quick. When we got to my apartment she started undressing before the door was fully closed behind us and since the layout of our apartments were the same she knew right where the bedroom was and she headed for it. She was on the bed and waiting by the time I got the last of my clothes off. 

 "Dinner is waiting lover: she said as I got on the bed and seconds later I had my tongue in her pussy. I worked on her until I got her off and by then my cock was throbbing and aching for her hot hole. I moved up, pushed in and her arms and legs came up to enfold me. I gave what I hoped was a good account of myself and when I was soft I pulled out of her and fell to the bed beside her. She reached down and her hand started fondling my limp meat as she said: 

 "I don't know what you think of me lover, but I'm not really as easy as you might think from the way things have gone. I admit that I once was. I once was so easy that I'm ashamed of myself when I remember those days. Those were the days when I got my 'honey pot' and 'Heaven' tattoos. For a while I ran with some bikers and that is when I got the big one on my back. 

 "I don't know how I would have ended up if I hadn't met Dan and married him. When I said "I do" all my wildness seemed to disappear. You might not believe it, but before you I hadn't had a man in almost a year. I don't know what it is about you, but my pussy got wet just talking to you in the store that day. I was afraid, actually scared, that you wouldn't call when I gave you my phone number. Love at first sight? I don't honestly know, but something made me give you my card that day. There is something special about you and I'm not the only one who feels it. Melanie has never acted toward a man the way she acted toward you tonight." 

 Her fondling me started to put new life in my dick and when it twitched a couple of times she moved down and took it in her mouth. A couple of minutes later I was standing tall and she moved on top of me and used her right hand to guide me into her as she settled down on me and started doing me cowgirl. She rode me until I had to get off and then I rolled her over and fucked her hard until I got the both of us off. When I pulled out Monica told me that she wished we could spend the night together but:  

 

 

===

"The baby sitter has to be home by ten. We have time for one more if you can get him up." 

 "With a little help I'm sure that I can." 

 She moved down to suck my cock, but I pulled away from her and maneuvered into position to go sixty-nine and then we went to work. She did get me up quickly and we did indeed have time for one more. 

 I walked her back to her place and after getting a good night kiss I asked her when I could see her again and she said she could do Thursday if I could. 

 "I'll make damned sure that I can." 

 Thursday she was waiting outside my apartment when I got home from work. I asked her to give ma a minute to wash up and then we could go somewhere and she said that she didn't want to go anywhere other than my bedroom. I told her that I wanted more out of our relationship than just sex and she told me that there would be time enough later for that, but at the moment she had almost a year of no sex to make up for. No way I wanted to put myself in the position of arguing against sex so off to the bedroom we went. We managed to get in four times before she had to leave. 

 As she was getting ready to leave I asked, "Any way we can make a Saturday date? You, Melanie and me? Maybe go to the zoo or something like that?" 

 Monica looked at me like I had two heads and then said, "Are you serious?" 

 "Of course I am and why would you even ask that?" 

 "All of the other guys I've gone out with acted like Melanie was something yucky on their shoes that needed to be shaken off. A lot of them never even asked for a second date. It was like my having a kid was the same as having a disease they were afraid they would catch so you wanting to include Melanie comes as a bit of a shock to me." 

 "Not all guys are shallow assholes. You finally lucked out and found one who isn't." 

 I walked her home, kissed her goodnight and told her I'd be by to pick them up Saturday at ten 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Friday after work I headed for the out of business gas station that I rented. It had two bays with lifts and a working air compressor and it was where I worked on the cars that I restored. 

 The Mustang that was my current project was almost ready for paint and I was hoping that I could get that done during the coming week. Then I would have to decide on whether to keep it or sell it. That was the problem that I had with all my projects. When I was done with them I always wanted to keep them. Thankfully I was always able, sometimes just barely, to cut them loose. I also needed to start looking for my next project. 

 As I worked on the '93 I wondered about what was happening with Monica and me. It was obvious that I was into her and not just for the sex and she did seem to enjoy the time she spent with me, but was it going to be long term? I realized that I hoped so, but what was she thinking? 

 When I was done I locked my toolbox, made sure that the compressor was off, set the alarm, locked the door and went on home. I was still thinking about Monica and me as I nodded off to sleep. 

 At nine in the morning I got a call from Monica. 

 "I have to cancel today. The water pump on my car is leaking and I have to get it taken care of today." 

 "No you don't. You won't need your car today because I'm driving. Tomorrow I'll replace your water pump." 

 "I can't ask you to do that." 

 "You didn't ask me; I volunteered." 

 "You know what I mean." 

 "You told Melanie about the zoo right?" 

 "Well yeah." 

 "You going to disappoint her when you don't really have to?" 

 "No. You're right. I can't do that." 

 We had a great day at the zoo. Melanie held my hand everywhere we went and I did everything that she wanted me to do. Food to feed the animals? I got it for her. She wanted a hot dog? She got it. Her feet got tired and she wanted me to carry her? Up on my shoulders she went and all the time Monica watched and shook her head in wonder. 

 When it was time to go I asked Monica where she wanted to go for dinner, but before she could get a word in Melanie asked: 

 "Can we go to Mickey Ds? Can I get a Happy Meal?" 

 Take a wild assed guess as to where we ate. 

 When I got them home Monica invited me in and offered me a beer. I sat down on the couch and was no sooner settled in than Melanie climbed onto my lap. Monica came back with the beer and told Melanie to get off of me. 

 "You can't just bother Rob whenever you want to." 

 "He's my friend mommy. I like him." 

 "I don't mind Monica. She's fine where she is." 

 "Maybe I mind. After all she is occupying my space." 

 "I guess I need to get a bigger lap." 

 When it was time for Melanie to go to bed she asked me if I would read to her. I looked at Monica and she said: 

 "There is a book of fairy tales on her night stand. It won't matter which one you chose; she's heard them all more than once and never gets tired of hearing them." 

 Once Melanie fell asleep I went out and joined Monica in the living room. We sat on the couch and necked until my hands went started seeking her body parts and then she pushed me away. 

 "I'm sorry lover, but not here. I'm way, way too noisy and we would wake her up." 

 "So when can we get together again and make some noise?" 

 "I'll see if I can get a sitter for tomorrow night." 

 "How are we going to handle the noise issue when we get married?" 

 She got a shocked look on her face. "Married? We've only known each other for two weeks Rob. We don't anything at all about each other." 

 "I didn't say it was going to be next week, but I am looking at it down the line. So why don't we take a look at what we DO know. We seem to like spending time with each other. I'd much rather be with you than any of the other girls I've dated. There is something about me that grabbed you enough that you were afraid that I might not call you. And according to you just my talking to you made you wet. Add to that the fact that we are dynamite in bed together, but more important than our sexual compatibility is the one thing that can not be overlooked." 

 "What's that?" 

 "You daughter likes me. 

 "You are serious? You are really thinking of marriage?" 

 "I am." 

 "I don't know what to say. I wasn't thinking that far ahead." 

 "You need to start thinking about it, because I do plan on asking in the not too distant future. I already know enough about you, but I realize you do need a little time to learn more about me." 

 I got up and she walked me to the door and after a pretty hot goodnight kiss I said: 

 "The parts houses don't open until nine on a Sunday so I'll be here around eight. I'll take you and Mel to breakfast and then we will go and get a water pump and get your pony taken care of." 

 I was at her door at five to eight and we went to the Village Inn for breakfast. At nine we were at Auto Zone picking up the water pump and some other parts. I'd taken the precaution of ordering the pump right after I'd talked to Monica on Saturday just to make sure that they had it in stock. As for the other parts? I'd learned the hard way that it was a good idea to change all the belts when you did the water pump. 

 I drove over to the station and changed the pump while Monica read and Melanie kept telling me that she was going to help. I let her hold wrenches for me and made out like it was a real important job. When I finished we drove back to Auto Zone so I could get my core charge refund and then I asked the girls what they wanted to do next. We had driven by a park on the way to the gas station and Melanie had seen the kids playing on the swings and slide so she wanted to go there. While I pushed Melanie on the swings Monica used her cell trying to line up a sitter for the night. We got lucky and she found one. We hit McDonalds for an early dinner and then I took the girls home. 

 The babysitter showed up and as soon as we were out of her apartment Monica said: 

 "Don't go all stupid on me and ask me where I want to go. If you don't know the answer to that question by now you need to get some professional help." 

 We had to call it quits at nine forty-five because the babysitter couldn't stay past ten. As I was walking Monica home I asked her when we could get together again. 

 "I don't know Rob. Fall leagues start next week and I've already committed to bowl in two leagues so that will take up Tuesday and Friday. I've decided to drop one of the mixed leagues for this year. What night do you bowl?" 

 "It was supposed to be Wednesday, but I may give it up. If I bowled on Wednesday it would only give us Monday and Thursday during the week and I want more than that." 

 "Actually you wouldn't have those days; at least not for making love. We could see each other, but we couldn't have sex." 

 "Why not?" 

 "Because I can't afford to pay a sitter for more than Tuesday and Friday and maybe one other night." 

 "You don't need to pay a sitter on your bowling nights. Mel can stay with me. That will free up your sitter money for other nights and I'll pay for any weekend sitters." 

 "There are other problems Rob. There are nights I have to work late. Doesn't happen often, but it does happen." 

 "So? I can watch Mel when that happens. The important thing, at least for me, is that I get as much time with you as I can." 

 "You still aren't getting the whole picture Rob. I need to spend time with my daughter. I can't just leave her with a sitter every night. The best that you are going to be able to get out of me is weekends and maybe, only maybe, an occasional day during the week." 

 "And the nights you spend with Melanie can't include me?" 

 "Some of them can, but I still need some alone time with her." 

 "It sounds like you are trying to ease me out of your life." 

 "Okay Rob; truth time. I am not trying to ease you out of my life, but I am trying to slow things down. Talking of marriage after us only knowing each other for two weeks scares me. I'm not anywhere close to thinking those kinds of thoughts. I'm going to need time Rob. Time to get to know you better. Time to see if I think we can make an honest go of things. I agree with you that we do seem to have a good head start, but I am not near as certain as you seem to be about making it long term. At least not yet." 

 "I guess I can see that. Maybe I have been coming on a bit strong, but in my defense I have never before felt so certain that something was just so perfectly right. I'll back off and let you set the pace. Can I make a suggestion that will guarantee me at least one night during the week?" 

 "I don't know. What is it?" 

 "That you and I bowl in a mixed league. I'll treat it as a date night and I'll take care of the babysitter. Maybe in the league you were going to drop?" 

 "I think that is a great idea." 

 "And in line with you needing to get to know me better would you and Mel go with me to a barbecue at my parent's house this coming Sunday?" 

 "I'd like that." 

 "I know I said that I'd let you set the pace, but are you and Mel free to have dinner with me tomorrow night? I make a hell of a meatloaf." 

 "I think we can do that." 

 "Say seven?" 

 "We will be there." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday I was home by five-thirty and I got right to work on dinner. I had it in the oven by six and then I spent a little time straightening up the apartment. Monica had been in the apartment before of course, but with her tendency for heading straight to the bedroom I don't know how much of the place she had 'really seen' and I didn't want her thinking I was a slob. It wasn't in bad shape, but it wouldn't hurt to try and make it a little better. 

 Monica and Melanie rang the doorbell right at seven. I told them to relax in front of the TV while I got dinner out of the oven, but Melanie wouldn't hear of it. 

 "I'm a big girl now and I know how to set the table." 

 I showed her where the silverware was and put the plates down where she could reach them. Monica watched with amusement from the living room as I kinda sorta hovered over Mel to make sure that she didn't drop and break any plates, but she didn't. 

 She didn't get the placement of the silverware right, but she had the concept. She had pieces on both sides of the plates, but they were random. One plate with a knife and fork on one side and spoon on the other. The next plate had the fork and spoon on one side and a knife on the other. Still it wasn't a bad effort coming as it did from a six year old. 

 I took the meat loaf and baked potatoes out of the oven and the tossed salad out of the fridge and we sat down to eat. The dinner conversation was monopolized by Melanie as se babbled on about her day at school. We heard all about her friends and her new boyfriend Jeffery. 

 "Boyfriend?" I asked. "Aren't you a little young to be having a boyfriend?" 

 "All girls have to have boyfriends. Mommy has one so I have to have one too." 

 "Your mommy has a boyfriend?" 

 I was looking at Monica as I asked the question and she looked back at me with a sort of half smile. 

 "Do you know who he is?" 

 "Of course I do silly; it's you." 

 The partial smile stayed on Monica's face and she gave a little shrug. 

 After dinner we parked Melanie in front of the Cartoon Network and Monica and I played cribbage and talked until it was time for them to leave. One of the things we talked about was my watching Melanie when Monica started bowling the next day. We decided that I would do the sitting at Monica's so that I could put Mel to bed rather than have her fall asleep at my place and then have to wake her up to take her home. 

 I kissed both girls goodnight and told Mel that I'd see her tomorrow and then I went to bed. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 Tuesday morning at six-thirty I got a call from Monica telling me that dinner would be on the table when I came over to sit for Melanie. I got there at a quarter to six, we ate dinner and then Monica left for the bowling alley. 

 I asked Mel what she wanted to do and she told me that she wanted to play a game. 

 "What kind of game?" 

 "A big people game like you play with mommy." 

 I knew that she was referring to the cribbage that Monica and I played and I knew the game was light years beyond her abilities so I got out a deck of cards and taught her how to play Fish. She was good with the numbers, but had trouble with the face cards. 

 After a while we sat and watched cartoons on TV until it was her bedtime and I read to her until she fell asleep. 

 Monica got home at nine forty-five and told me how her night went. She rolled a 214 and won a jackpot, but missed getting total pins by six. 

 We made out on the sofa for a bit and then I went home. 

 Wednesday I picked Monica up at six-thirty and we were at the lanes by ten to seven and I was introduced to my new teammates. It was a mixed league and the rules were that there had to be at least two women or two men on a team. Some teams had three men and two women and the others had the reverse. Our team was made up of Bill and Paula Martin, Susan Billings, Monica and I. 

 I was the lowest average so I got to be lead off. Next was Susan, followed by Paula, Monica and Bill. We got off to a good start and took all three games and I had a good night with a one sixty-four average over the three games. Monica put me to shame with a 179, a 184 and a 201. 

 After we were done and had gotten out of the way of the late league I told Mon I needed to hit the pro shop and by a new bag and I told her that I'd meet her in the bar. I bought the bag and headed for the bar where I found Monica sitting with some guy. I walked up to the table, pulled out a chair and sat down expecting Monica to introduce me to the guy, but what I got instead was the guy saying: 

 "I don't recall asking you to join us." 

 I looked at Mon and asked, "Did you join him at the table or did he join you?" 

 "I was here first." 

 I turned to the guy and said, "She is my girlfriend; we came together and we will be leaving together and since my girl is sitting here I will be sitting here to. If you have a problem with that I am more than willing to go outside to the parking lot with you where we can go into greater detail on the matter." 

 He gave me a nasty look and got up and left. 

 "Friend of yours" I asked as he walked away. 

 "Hardly. I dated him twice, decided that twice was one to many, but he can't seem to take no for an answer." 

 "Maybe he will now." 

 "My hero. Saving me from the bad man." 

 "Damned straight woman. Saving you for myself." 

 We went to my place and played 'kissy face' and 'suckie fuckie' until it was time for her to go home and cut the babysitter loose. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Thursday was Monica's alone time with Melanie so I went to the gas station and got the Mustang ready for its trip to the paint shop on Saturday. 

 Friday dinner was waiting for me when I got to Monica's and I got a kiss for dessert just before she left. Mel and I played cards again and this time I taught her to play War. She didn't have school the next day so she was able to stay up until Monica got home. 

 Mon put her to bed, but Mel insisted that I read to her which I did until she fell asleep. Once she was out Mon and I settled on the couch and made out for maybe twenty minutes and then she pulled away and said: 

 "This is just so stupid" and she took my hand, pulled me up from the couch and led me into her bedroom. As soon as the door closed she started undressing and she looked over at me and said: 

 "Don't just stand there; get with the program." 

 I quickly disrobed and followed her onto the bed. She handed me her panties and told me to stuff them in her mouth when she started getting loud. 

 That was about six minutes into things. 

 I went down on her for a while and then moved up and pushed into her wetness. I started slow and in a minute or so she told me to do her harder. I picked up the pace and we rocked along until she cried out: 

 "Fuck me damn it! Fuck me hard" and that's when the panties came into play. I got us both off and then we moved into a sixty-nine until I was up again. Once up and ready she got on her hands and knees and I did her doggie. A little way into it she moaned: 

 "My ass baby; I want it in my ass." 

 I spent a little time getting her ready with my thumb and fingers and then I changed holes. She screamed in pleasure and the panties got used again. I got us both off and then fell to the bed next to her. After a minute or so Mon said: 

 "Mel doesn't usually wake up until seven or so. Can you be gone by then?" 

 "Don't know. After you get done with me I tend to sleep like a log. Think you can get me up in time?" 

 She laughed and said, "I haven't had any problems in getting you up so far." 

 As she was talking she had been playing with my cock and she giggled and said: 

 "See?" 

 Sure enough I was starting to get up again. She got up, went to the bathroom and came back with what she needed to clean my cock and then she went down on me and got me all the way up. She mounted me cowgirl and rode me to the point where I just had to get my nut and I rolled her over, stuffed her panties in her mouth and fucked her as hard and fast as I was able. I got her off twice before I got mine and then I pulled out, fell to the bed next to her and said: 

 "Give me a few minutes to catch my breath and I'll get out of here." 

 "I don't want you to go, but I can't chance having Mel seeing you here when she gets up." 

 I told her that I understood, but I really didn't. Mel was too young to understand and by the time she was old enough I figured to be married to Monica. But it was what Monica wanted so I got up, dressed and got ready to leave. 

 I told Mon that I had to take the Mustang to the paint shop in the morning and I asked her if she and Mel would like to go with me and then maybe have a picnic at the park later. She said it sounded like a good idea and I told her that I would pick her up at nine. I went to my place, set the clock for eight, and was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I picked the girls up at nine and we drove over to the gas station to get the Mustang. Mon drove my truck and followed me over to Ray's Collision. Ray looked over the car and asked me the same question that he always asked me every time I brought him a car to paint. 

 "You going to keep this one or sell it?" 

 My stock answer had always been, "Don't know. Can't make up my mind." 

 This time I knew the answer. 

 "Sell it." 

 That caught him by surprise. 

 "Are you sure? 

 "Yep. Need the money." 

 "I just may have someone who will want it. What are you going to ask for it?" 

 I gave him a figure and he told me that he thought it was reasonable. I knew he was wondering why I was so quick to make up my mind. It was simple. I wanted the money. I really didn't need it, but I wanted it. I wanted it because I was certain – dead certain – that I was going to marry Monica and I was going to want to get us out of apartments and into a house. It wasn't going to be a problem doing it because I had the money to do it, but I wanted to pay cash and not have to finance it. I had a little over 415K in the bank in the form of checking accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. I even had a money market account with a broker that I knew and trusted. My brother. But I wasn't sure that it was enough to get the house I wanted so I wanted to add to it. 

 Why was I living in an apartment if I had that much in the bank? Simple. Living alone I didn't need more than an apartment, but after Karen and before Monica I hadn't met a woman I cared enough about to eve consider anything other than an apartment. 

 How come I had so much in the bank? My dad was in the insurance business and when Karen and I married he convinced me to by life insurance. Because of my age and Karen's age at the time I was able to get a 250K policy on each of us for a reasonable amount. The policy had the standard double indemnity clause and when Karen was killed I received 500K. I had credit cards, but I rarely used them preferring to deal in cash. I kept adding to the account when I sold the cars I bought and rebuilt. When I sold the car part of the proceeds went to purchase my next project and the rest went into the bank. 

 Financially I was in great shape. My Silverado was only five months old and it was paid for. I had a 401k at work and it was company matching up to five percent and I was putting ten percent of my pay into it every payday. 

 Ray gave me a couple of leads on vehicles that I might want to consider for my next project and then I left the Mustang in his capable hands and left. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 We drove to the park and let Mel play and around one I got out the picnic basket that I had packed and we ate. I had the girl's home by three and then I went home, showered and changed to get ready for my evening out with Monica. I picked her up at six and for a change I didn't ask her where she wanted to go or what she wanted to do. I wanted a real night out with her and not a "Just take me to your bedroom" night. 

 We had dinner at Duke's Steak House and then I took her to The Pit for drinks and dancing. We had a pretty good time and around eleven we went back to my apartment. Mon had found a babysitter that could spend the night so she didn't have to rush home. A good thing since we didn't run me out of steam until three in the morning. 

 Mon was gone when I woke up at nine. I fixed myself some breakfast and then I did my laundry and cleaned the apartment until one when I picked the girl's up and headed for my parents house for the Sunday afternoon barbecue. 

 It was a family gathering and in addition to my parents my brother, sister, their spouses and their five kids were there. I owed my siblings a lot. Before they got married and started producing offspring I, as the oldest, was under considerable pressure to give my parents grandchildren. I could never convince them that Karen just wasn't going to let me get her pregnant. When Ron married Wanda and Wanda popped out twin girls and a boy a year and a half later the pressure was off me. Then Julie married Mike and in the space of three years they produced a grandson and a granddaughter I stopped hearing from my mother about not giving her grandbabies. 

 My entire family seemed taken by Monica and Melanie. Ron's youngest and both of Julie's were close in age to Mel and she was immediately involved in playing with them. Mom, Wanda and Julie quickly stripped Monica away from me, no doubt to get the dirt on me (and give up some at the same time) and I ended up relieving dad on the grill so he could have a beer or two and shoot the shit with Ron and Mike. It was a good day and as we were getting ready to leave both mom and Julie told me that I'd be a fool to let Mon get away. 

 "She is perfect for you" Julie said. 

 On the way home Monica said that she really liked my family and Mel said that she hoped that she could see Jack, Marvin and Jessica again. 

 "They were really fun to play with." 

 I dropped the girl's off, got kisses from both of them and then headed for my apartment and bed. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 On the drive home Sunday Monica told me that she and Mel had to go see her mother so she doubted that she would see me before Tuesday. Monday when I got off work I went to look at a couple of the prospects that Ray had given me for my next rebuilding project. I found a '91 Silverado that I liked the looks of and I made the man an offer and he accepted it. I wrote him a check and called Westside Towing and arranged to have the pickup moved to the gas station. 

 Tuesday through Friday were pretty much carbon copies of the previous week except that on Wednesday after bowling Mon told me that we were invited to her parent's for dinner on Saturday. 

 Saturday I met her parents and I immediately liked them and I got the impression that they liked me. They kept Mel overnight so when I took Monica home I spent the night and it carried over until noon the next day. I came to the conclusion that Mon was insatiable and that the only reasons that I was able to stay with her were my daily trips to the gym. There was a 24 Hour Fitness Center three blocks from where I worked and I spent most of my lunch hours there working out. 

 I took Mon to the Red Robin for lunch and then we went over and picked up Melanie. We ended up staying at her parent's for dinner and then I took the girl's home. 

 Monday after work I went over to the paint shop. I'd called Ray and told him that I would be by and when I got there he introduced me to a man who was interested in buying the car. I gave him my price and he took it and wrote me a check on the spot. I swung by a flower shop on the way home and I bought two flower arrangements – one for Monica and one for Mel – and I stopped by Mon's apartment and gave them to the girl's. I got kisses from both of them and headed home. 

 ++++++++++++++++ 

 The next two months went by pretty much as repeats of the previous weeks and then I decided that it was time to make it happen or start to back away from potential heartbreak. It was a Saturday and Mon had a sleep over babysitter. We went out for dinner, stopped for a few drinks and some dancing and then went back to my place. I fixed Monica a drink and then I took a knee and asked her to marry me. 

 She didn't light up, become all smiles and jump for joy. She looked away from me and seemed hesitant to speak. Finally she looked at me and said: 

 "I've been dreading this and hoping that it wouldn't happen. I've been very happy with our relationship honey, but I guess it is confession time for me and you may want to withdraw your proposal when you hear what I have to say. I told you before that I was pretty much a slut up until I hooked up with Dan, but I never told you the full story. 

 "I started my journey as a cock loving slut in high school. A week after the senior prom and two days after my eighteenth birthday I gave my cherry to Drew who was our next door neighbor's nineteen year old son and I loved it. After that first time we did it everywhere we could any time we could find the time to do it. We went to a party one night and I got a little high on alcohol and Drew and I snuck off and found a bedroom. We got it on and after Drew came he got up and had to go and take a leak. Minutes later we were back at it. Halfway into it I discovered that it wasn't Drew. It was some guy who had wandered into the room and had seen me lying on the bed with my legs spread wide and no panties on. I didn't care. I was being fucked and I was loving it. The guy finished and wasn't out of me a second before Drew was back in. Drew finished and another guy climbed on. I was told later that nine guys fucked me that night and three of them more than once. 

 "After that night I was pretty much a slut for Drew and his buddies. Threesomes, foursomes, gangbangs; I did them all and I did them willingly. After graduation I went to the local community college. Drew and most of the other guys I partied with had athletic scholarships to four year schools, but Drew had a cousin who was going to the community college and he hooked us up. Archie ran with a bunch of bikers and I rode with Archie. At first it was just Archie, but later it was the whole biker gang. 

 "I found out that the rule was that for the first month you were just the old lady of the guy you rode with, but after a month you were the whole clubs to use. You were clued in during that first month so you could bail out if you wanted to. If you were still there after that first month it was taken for granted that you knew what you were letting yourself in for. I couldn't wait for that first month to be up so I could get back to threesomes, foursomes and pulling trains. I wasn't forced and I wasn't drugged; I just loved to fuck. 

 "The second semester my first class was Business Law and the guy who sat next to me on my right was Dan. I know most people do mot believe in love at first sight, but that is the only way that I can describe what happened between Dan and me. I quit the biker gang cold, put all thoughts of multiple partners aside and concentrated solely on Dan. We got married and I expected to live happily ever after. 

 "Dan was upfront about not wanting any kids and he made sure that I understood that before we got married. Then the pill failed me. Hindsight being twenty- twenty I guess I should have backed up the pill with a diaphragm, but I didn't and I ended up pregnant. Dan said it wasn't a problem and we would just arrange to abort. I refused. Even though I really didn't want to be a mother I just couldn't go the abortion route. Dan and I fought over it until it was too late to have the procedure and that's when he stomped out of the house and joined the Army. 

 "I was angry at him for what he did and after he'd been gone a month I said a mental "Fuck you asshole" and I called up Archie. He spent two days in my bed and on the third day he brought Max with him and the next day it was Max and Ted. The guys thought it was great fucking a married pregnant woman and I was back to multiple partners and gangbangs and loving it. I was on the back of Archie's ride on my way to pull a train when my water broke. 

 "I got the news about Dan's death a month after Melanie was born and I'm sorry to say that it didn't have any affect on me at all. He had abandoned me and as far as I was concerned it was a case of good riddance. When the doctor told me that I was cleared to go back to having sexual relations I parked Melanie with my parents for the weekend and called Archie. I spent Saturday with him and Sunday with him, Ted and Max. By the time I got to my parents house to pick up Melanie I was feeling guilty over leaving her. For the next week Archie and several others spent the nights at my place and then one night while I was in a foursome Melanie started crying and I was so into the sex that I kept on going and let her cry. When the guys were done with me and she was still crying I finally woke up to what I had done and the real guilt hit me. That night caused me to pull my head out of my ass and to start being the best mother to Melanie that I could be. I doubt that you want to be married to a woman like that." 

 "I probably wouldn't want to be married to a woman like that, but that isn't you now is it. You put all of that behind you and concentrated on being Melanie's mother. What you did in the past is none of my business. It's the woman you are now that I'm asking to marry me. There are a few things behind me that I'm not all that proud of. The past is past. Our life started that day in King Soopers. Anything before that day has no part in our life now." 

 "It isn't that simple honey. The guys who did me are around and it is inevitable that someday we will run into some of them. They were a crude bunch and I can just imagine some of the things they will say or try and do. I don't know that you will want to put yourself in a position to have to put up with it." 

 "They are the ones that need to worry. If I have to fight the whole bunch of them as far as I'm concerned you are worth it." 

 "You really mean that?" 

 "You know I do. Besides, you know I've always wanted kids and that the only way I'm going to have any is marry a woman who has them. I know for a fact that Melanie will be okay with it. You have to marry me for Melanie's sake if for no other reason." 

 "Well I guess that if it is what Melanie wants I'll have to say yes." 

 We were married in a civil ceremony with her parents and my parents as witnesses. We bought a four bedroom house on ten acres. A bedroom for us, one for Melanie, one turned into a home office and one for use as a guest room. It had a three car garage and I had a lift installed in one of the bays so I'd be able to continue my hobby of rebuilding vehicles. We settled in to live the good life. 

 +++++++++++++++++ 

 Three years into the marriage the first big problem showed up. There had been a few little ones along the way. Some of her old fuck buddies did say and try a few things, but some broken noses, black eyes and sorely hurting testicles put an end to most of it. A four day hospital stay for Archie kind of drove the point home that I didn't take kindly to their actions. 

 The big problem came from Monica's work place. She came home from work one night and told me that she had a major problem. 

 "Alex, one of the sales agents in the office had a friend stop by and visit him a couple of days ago. The friend was one of the bikers I ran with back when I was a wild child and Barney recognized me. Apparently some pictures were taken of me during one of the trains I pulled and Alex told me that Barney had given the photos to hi. Alex wants me to fuck him or he will send copies to you, pass the photos around the office and also in the two restaurants where we sometimes have lunch." 

 "You will have to do it here at the house." 

 "What!! Are you out of your fucking mind?!!" 

 "Not at all. We just need to get him where I can get my hands on him in private. You tell him that I will be out of town for three days and he needs to come here because I call every night I'm out of town and you need to be here to take the call. Tease him a little. Ask him if he wouldn't like to be doing you on my bed and be in your pussy while you were talking to me. I'll bet that he will jump at the chance." 

 And he did. 

 Monica told him that she put Melanie to bed at nine and that I usually called around ten so if he could get there at nine-thirty they could be well on their way by the time that I called. She told him that he had to be gone by six in the morning before Melanie got up. Then she told him if he was good he could come back the other two nights I would be gone. 

 He knocked on the door at nine twenty-five and Monica answered the door naked except for a pair of 'come fuck me' pumps. She led him to the bedroom telling him that she wanted him in her ass when I called. 

 "I never let my hubby have my ass so you will be the first one in it since Barney and his buddies." 

 I was behind the bedroom door when he came into the room and he never knew what hit him. He went down and I kicked him in the nuts a couple of times and a couple of more times in the ribs. I picked him up, tossed him on the bed, stripped him and then tied him spread eagled to the bedposts. I put a ball gag in his mouth while Mon put on a robe and went out into the kitchen and then came back with a very sharp boning knife. Then we waited for Alex to become a little more aware of his situation. 

 When he started tugging on the ropes that had him tied down I said: 

 "Welcome to Rob's House of Horrors. I hope to make your stay with us as painful as possible. You need to know up front that I don't take kindly to guys who try to fuck my wife and make me a cuckold. In fact it pisses me off severally. Pisses me off to the point where I really want to hurt them. Want to hurt them bad. 

 "Monica and I are in disagreement about what I should do. I want to cut your dick off one inch at a time, but Monica says that I should castrate you and leave you your dick. That way every time you looked at it you would be reminded that you couldn't use it any more because of what you tried to do to her. 

 "I'm interested in what you think I should do. Oh hell. Stupid me. You can't talk with that gag in your mouth can you. But if I take it out yours screams will wake up the neighbors and we wouldn't want that now would we?" 

 I pulled on a pair of rubber gloves and then asked Mon to hand me the knife. 

 "No. I want to be the one to do it. I'm the one he was trying to blackmail." 

 She pulled on a pair of rubber gloves, came over to the bed and took Alex's cock in her hand. 

 She looked into his eyes and said, "This is what you wanted right? Me and your cock getting together?" 

 She stroked his cock a couple of times and put the knife against it. 

 "One inch at a time. I'll leave you an inch so you will have something to look at to remind you of what you used to have." 

 Just as she started to make the cut – I let her break the skin – I said: 

 "Hold up Mon; I just thought of something. We need to know where the photos are." 

 "Damn it Rob! I'm ready to do this. I'm all psyched up and I want to do it." 

 "Just hold on; you still might be able to. He tells me what I want to know or I turn you loose on him." 

 I took the ball gag out of Alex's mouth and he blubbered, "Don't do it. Please God don't do it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I swear to God I didn't mean it." 

 "Didn't mean what?" Monica asked. 

 "I don't have any pictures. It was a bluff. Barney told me about you and I saw a way to get you. Barney didn't have pictures. I lied. I swear on my mother's grave that I lied." 

 "What do you think Mon?" 

 "I don't know. He was awful sure of himself when he approached me about it." 

 "You never saw any pictures?" 

 "No. He pulled his shit on me and I hurried home and told you. We made our plans and then I went to work and set it up for him to be here tonight." 

 While we were talking Alex's dick was bleeding from where Monica had nicked it and Alex was staring at the blood oozing out of it. 

 "There is another matter. We need to know who he might have told that he was going to be here tonight and what he was going to be doing." 

 Alex blubbered, "No one. I swear! I didn't tell no one. If I'd of told they would have wanted in. I wanted to keep her for myself. I'm telling the truth here. Please. I'm begging you. Please God don't hurt me." 

 I stared at him in silence for a bit and then said, "It is up to you Mon. I'll leave it in your hands" and then I looked at Alex and said "Pun intended" since his cock was still in Monica's hand with the knife only a fraction of an inch away from it. 

 Monica squeezed his cock and he screamed, but then she let loose of it.  

 

 

===

"I want to do it. I'm ready to do it and I really, really want to do it, but I guess I need to be practical. If I do what I want and cut his cock off the blood will soak through the sheets and into the mattress and the asswipe isn't worth the cost of a new mattress. Just cut him loose and throw him out." 

 Then she looked Alex right in the eye and said, "I'm going to start carrying a knife to work with me and if you give me any more shit I swear to God I'll walk up to you in the middle of the office and bury the blade in your crotch! Believe it!" 

 She left the room and I said, "You got lucky this time. Next time you try some shit like this you might not get off this easy. Oh, and before I cut you loose you need to know that we have been taping what has been said here. That you were trying to blackmail Monica into having sex with you. Think about that if you decide to run to the cops over what happened here tonight. Blackmail is illegal. You did know that right?" 

 I cut him loose and told him to dress and get out before Monica changed her mind. When he was gone Monica pulled me into the bedroom. 

 "No making love to me tonight baby. I'm hot and I want to be fucked and fucked hard! Having his cock in one hand and a knife in the other and knowing that I had the power turned me on. Fuck me baby; fuck me and make me scream!" 

 I did. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monica went to work the next day and Alex wasn't there. She found out around lunch time that he had called in and quit. 

 Not being a totally trusting individual and having some small doubts about Alex's confession I tracked Barney down and had a talk with him. When I left him I was satisfied that no photos were ever taken of Monica when she was playing her sexual games. 

 I don't know if her past will ever rise up again and attempt to cause problems, but if it does we can handle it.
