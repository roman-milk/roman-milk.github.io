Rob's Revenge

I picked her up at the apartment that she shared with two other girls and we went out for dinner, drinks and dancing. She seemed a little nervous when she got into the car and I put it down to the fact that this was the first time I had picked her up instead of meeting her some place. I got the feeling that from the way she was acting that she was afraid of being seen with me and I asked her about it as I pulled away from the curb. 

 "It's my dad. He has been asking Gwen and Harriet (her roommates) about what I've been doing and who I've been seeing. Gwen even told me that he is paying part of her rent to keep an eye on me. If he's paying Gwen he is probably paying Harriet also." 

 "Why would he do something like that?" 

 "He worries about me doing something stupid and ruining my life. He never wanted me to move out of the dorms in the first place." 

 "What have you done to make him think that you are going to do something stupid?" 

 "It isn't what I've done, but what my two sisters have done." 

 "And what is that?" 

 "They dropped out of school and got married to guys who my dad considers fortune hunters. He says that Amos and Jack only married my sisters because of their trust funds." 

 "Trust funds?" 

 "My grandparents set up trust funs for all three of us grandchildren." 

 "You have a trust fund? We have been dating over two months now so how come I've never heard of it?" 

 "I think dad is right about Amos and Jack so I don't tell guys about it because I want to be sure they want me and not the two million I'll get when I either graduate from college or get married." 

 "So what you are saying is that if your dad finds out about me he will assume that I'm just another fortune hunter? Is that why I've never met your parents?" 

 "Yes to both." 

 "Well I can put your mind and your dad's mind to rest. If our relationship gets to the point where I ask you to marry me, and I don't mind saying that it is extremely likely that I will, I will sign a prenuptial agreement that will satisfy your father." 

 "You would do that?" 

 "Sure I would. I don't need your money. I have a trust fund of my own that I get when I turn thirty. It is only half as big as yours, but it is enough." 

 "I never knew that." 

 "My dad clued me in real early about women who would come after me for the money so like you I've always kept quiet about it. I think that we are far enough along in our relationship to realize that neither of us is after the other for their money." 

 "I still don't want my dad to know about us. Because of what my sister's did he will try and split us apart." 

 "Ain't gonna happen kiddo; it just ain't gonna happen." 

 We had dinner at Duke's Steak House and then went to the Black Onion for drinks and dancing. We had been there about an hour and I'd had two drinks and Connie had consumed four as we danced and enjoyed ourselves when my cell rang. I answered it and then told Connie that it was a call that I had to take and I got up and went to find some quiet. 

 I went into the men's room and found Charlie waiting for me. "Ready?" I asked and he smiled and said, "We're good to go. See you in a few" and he left the room. I went into one of the stalls and sat down. I took the crossword puzzle that I'd clipped out of the daily paper out of my pocket and began to work it. It took me twelve minutes which I figured was enough time. 

 I headed back to my table and when I got there I saw Charlie and Connie out on the dance floor. I sat down at the table and waited. When the music stopped they came back to the table and Charlie scowled when he saw me. 

 "This is a private party bud. Scram!" 

 "It is indeed a private party and I don't recall inviting you. Did you invite him Connie?" 

 "No, but he was kind of pushy and it was easier to dance with him than cause a scene." 

 "Hey! I bought you two drinks." 

 "And it got you three dances which was more than you had any right to expect." 

 She sat down and I said to Charlie, "Thanks for keeping her occupied while I was on the phone. You can leave now and I'll take over." 

 "You bitch!" he snarled at Connie and I started to stand up and Charlie turned and hurried away. 

 I sat back down and said, "I apologize for taking the call and being gone so long, but they had a problem at work and it seems that I'm the only one that they could think of who might have been able to tell them what they should be looking for to fix things." 

 "I should be upset, but I'm not. I like to dance and he was a very good dancer." 

 "And he had very good taste when it came to his choice of prey." 

 "Yes, there is that." 

 We had one more drink and a couple dances and then she said she wasn't feeling well and I suggested that we call it a night. She was passed out when we got to my apartment. I got her inside, undressed the both of us and then I fucked her. Despicable of me I know, but when you are taking revenge things are not always going to be nice, neat and above board. I worked on getting myself hard again and then I fucked her a second time and twenty minutes later I fucked her yet again. After each time I put a pillow under her ass to elevate it and give my sperm a better chance of racing down to where I was hoping that they would find their target. 

 There was an element of luck needed here and I'd spent a considerable amount of money to improve my odds. That and a few lies. I'd put private investigators on both Gwen and Harriet with instructions to find out as much about them as possible. When I got the report I picked Harriet to be my target. She was from a poor family and was attending school on a handful of scholarships and student loans and she was ambitious. I sat down with her one day, told her a few lies and offered her five grand to help me and she had snapped it up. 

 I had taken a blue pill to help me and an hour later when Connie showed signs of waking I got back in the saddle and started slowly stroking in and back. After about ten minutes she started to respond and in fifteen she had her finger nails dug into my ass as she tried to pull me in deeper. The Ecstasy in the drug cocktail that Charlie had put in her drink had obviously kicked in. 

 Connie wanted it harder and faster and I did my best to give her what she wanted. I knew that because of my three earlier sessions that I wasn't going to be getting off anytime soon. It took me a while to send my fourth load into her, but I managed to get it done. She still wanted to go when I pulled out and she swung around and took my cock in her mouth. It took her (and the Viagra) a while to get the job done, but get me up they did and it took me almost twenty- five minutes to cum although I'm sure that nothing came out of my dick. By then I was through even if she wasn't. Not being a complete asshole I did what I could to help her out. Using my mouth and fingers I brought her off a couple of more times and then I called it quits. 

 I got up and left her on the bed and went out into the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee. Connie walked into the room twenty minutes later. She had put on her dress, but was barefoot. The look on her face wasn't the least bit pleasant. 

 "You bastard!" she snarled. "How could you do that to me? I thought that I meant something to you." 

 "Whoa up there little girl. I didn't do anything you didn't want. You were the one who slid across the seat to get next to me. You were the one who reached for my zipper. It was your hand that pulled my cock out into the open not mine." 

 "I did not!" 

 "The hell you didn't. It surprised the hell out of me, but I sure wasn't going to stop you. It is what I have wanted to do since the day I met you and I sure wasn't going to say no once you started it." 

 "I never..." 

 "Oh yes you did! You got my cock out, stroked it for a while and then lowered your head and took it in your mouth. I was so surprised I almost ran off the road. I'll tell you one thing. When we did it the first time it was obvious that you were no virgin so all that "I'm going down the aisle pure" that you have been feeding me was just so much bullshit. For what it is worth I finally figured it out during the second time we did it. That guy you were dancing with when I got back from my phone call bought you a drink didn't he?" 

 "Two actually." 

 "He obviously thought you were alone and hadn't figured on me. He slipped you a date rape drug and was planning on getting you out of there and having some fun. I came back and spoiled his plan and ended up getting the benefit of it. And I am not sorry. Not one damned bit. It means that I don't have to wait until we say I do to enjoy you." 

 She stared at me silently as she considered what I'd just told her and then she said: 

 "You need to get me to a pharmacy so I can get a morning after pill. I wasn't protected and I'm in my fertile period." 

 "You don't need a morning after pill. One of the things I needed to discuss with you when I proposed was how you felt about not having children. I can't have any because I'm sterile. That's the reason for my divorce. My wife found out that I couldn't get her pregnant and she left me." 

 "How did you find out?" 

 "When we hadn't gotten her pregnant after three years of trying we both got tested. According to all the tests I have no chance of producing offspring." 

 "I've never thought about having kids. I'd probably be a lousy mother anyway. So I guess I'll just say yes." 

 "Yes to what?" 

 "In a roundabout way you did just propose to me right?" 

 "Yeah. I guess I did didn't I." 

 She pulled her dress up over her head and dropped it on the floor. She had been naked underneath and she struck a pose and said: 

 "This give you any ideas?" 

 My cock surprised the hell out of me and stirred and I guessed one more time was going to be possible after all. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Connie was determined that she was going to graduate before getting married and that meant another year before it would happen and that suited me just fine. 

 Once we started making love Connie and I had sex two or three times a week which gave me that many more chances to make her belly swell. I had lied about being sterile and I had lied for it being the reason for my divorce. Actually I didn't get divorced, but Connie didn't need to know that. 

 Two months went by and then one night Connie called me and said we needed to talk. I asked her what about and she said she couldn't talk about it over the phone so I told her I'd meet her at the Village Inn three blocks from her place. She was there when I got there and I sat down across from her and asked: 

 "What's up?" 

 "We have a problem. I'm pregnant." 

 I looked at her in silence for about a minute and then I said, "I fail to see where WE have a problem. I'm sterile Connie so I guess you need to call one of your other lovers and lay the news on him" 

 I got up and walked out of the restaurant. It was a shame really because I did have some strong feelings for Connie. They were strong enough that under different circumstances I could very well have married the girl. The problem was that my hatred of her father was way, way stronger than the feeling I had for Connie and given his social standing in the community giving him an illegitimate grandchild would cause him major embarrassment. That sort of thing just did not happen to the Smythe-Barringtons. An unwed mother? Oh the shame of it all! 

 It hadn't been easy and it had been expensive to reach that point in time, but quality revenge is time consuming and expensive. I'd had to hire a private detective to find out all that could be found out about Constance Allison Smythe-Barrington and then using that information I had to arrange to meet her and get her interested enough in me to go out with me. 

 Once I had accomplished that and we had been dating two months I had to put the detective to work at finding out everything that he could about Connie's roommates. Once I settled on Harriet I had to talk her into giving me the extremely personal information about Connie that a private detective could not get. 

 One day when Connie was visiting her parents – whom I'd not yet met – I sat down with Harriet and told her that I desperately needed her help. I told her that I was hopelessly in love with Connie and even though Connie swore that she loved me I was wondering why she had never let me meet her parents. Harriet told me that Connie's parents always found some way to break up any relationship that Connie formed with a guy. Their stance was that none of the guys that Connie chose had the proper social standing and were not suitable for her. They were pushing her to form a relationship with the son of one of their friends, but Connie couldn't stand the guy. 

 "If I can get her pregnant she will have to marry me and her parents be damned." 

 Then I offered her five thousand dollars if she would help me. She had hesitated a few seconds before saying that she didn't like either one of Connie's parents and she would help me any way she could. I found out from Harriet that birth control pills gave Connie problems and so she didn't use them and figured that she didn't need them anyway since she had no intension of engaging in sexual activities until she was married. Harriet confided in me that Connie wasn't all that interested in sex anyway. She'd had intercourse with four different guys while she was in high school and hadn't gotten anything out of it. 

 The most important information that I got from Harriet was information about Connie's menstrual cycle. With that information I had been able to plot Connie's fertile times. I had used that information and the result was that Robert Conner Ellsworth Smythe-Barrington was going to be the grandfather of a child born out of wedlock. A stain on the Smythe-Barrington family name. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The chain of events that led to Connie's pregnancy started almost twelve years earlier when I met Samantha Sue Catron on the first day of class at the start of the tenth grade. Tall at five nine and with hair as black as a raven's wing that fell to the middle of her back she instantly caught my attention. I'd no chance to talk to her that morning, but when lunch period came I saw her sitting alone in the school cafeteria. I walked to her table and asked if I could join her. She looked up at me and shrugged so I sat down and introduced myself. She looked around the room and saw at least a dozen empty tables and then looked at me and said: 

 "Why are you here?" 

 "In a nut shell? I'm here because you are here." 

 "Would you care to explain that?" 

 "I've lived here all my life and I've never seen you before and that means, at least to my way of thinking, that none of the other guys here have ever seen you before. You know what you look like and you know guys are going to flock to you likes flies flock to a pile of sugar. I wanted to be the first in line." 

 She gave me an amused look and then said: 

 "What makes you think that being the first in line will get you anywhere? Maybe the tenth guy in line is the one I'll go for." 

 "I know all the guys in the two classes ahead of us and in the class behind us and I'm here to tell you that I am head and shoulders above all of them." 

 "Pretty sure of yourself aren't you." 

 "Would you want your guy to be any less?" 

 "You have a point there, but I'm new in town and I don't know very many people yet. I think I'll wait a while before picking out 'my guy', but I will put your name on the list I end up choosing from." 

 "You will need to get to know those who make the list so how about we start the process by you going out with me this evening?" 

 "No can do. My parents only let me date on Friday and Saturdays." 

 "Okay then; would you go out with me this coming Friday?" 

 "I can do that." 

 We talked and I found out her dad had gotten a promotion that had caused them to move from Dallas to our city and they had only been in town for five days. She was an only child and she intended to go to college and become a lawyer. She learned that I was also an only child and I intended to go to college and become a civil engineer like my father. 

 Our date Friday was spent at the arcade and I had a great time and she also seemed to, but when I asked her to go to the movies with me on Saturday she told me that Phil Snyder had already asked her out and she was going skating with him. I was disappointed, but I asked her for a date the next Friday. Al Moore. 

 "How about Saturday?" Chuck Olsen. 

 "The Friday after that?" Billy Holbrook. 

 "The Saturday after that." 

 "I'd love to." 

 That set the pattern for the next year. I would take Sammi out, ask her out again and find out that her next weekend or two weekends were already booked. But I persevered. The other guys slowly fell by the wayside either not finding what they were hoping for or not being willing to wait two or three weeks for another date. By the start of the eleventh grade I was getting a date almost every week end and by spring break I was the only one she was going out with. 

 She went to Dallas to spend the summer with her grandparents and when we started the twelfth grade I asked her to go steady with me and she said yes. I reached into the bag I had with me, took out my letter sweater and handed it to her. Her smile was so bright when she took it from me that it could have been seen from the space station. I know that it is a cliché, but we exchanged virginities the night of the senior prom and from that night on we made love every chance we got. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Disaster struck during our second year of college. She told me that she was pregnant. Apparently some medication she took for a cold negated her birth control pills. The news did not upset me because to me that meant I got to marry her sooner rather than later. The down side was that I would have to drop out of college and get a job. 

 My parents were highly pissed at me as it had always been their goal that I would be the first on both sides of the family to get a degree. Sammi's parents just shrugged and gave her a hundred bucks to pay for the blood tests, the license and the justice of the peace and we were married. 

 I got a job at the gas company and it was decided that there was no sense in Sammi dropping out of college and getting a job because in seven months she would have to leave the job to have the baby. She was attending on scholarships so it wouldn't be a financial drain on us. I had a college fund that my parents and both sets of grandparents had been putting money into and they all agreed – my parents reluctantly – that I could take the money even though college was now out of the picture. I used it to get a two bedroom apartment and furnish it and it still left twelve thousand in the bank that I would sit on for emergencies. 

 Our goal was to get Sammi through college (both sets of parents agreeing to babysit) and then she would get a good job and then help put me through college and then, both of us college educated and with good jobs, we would start to live the American dream. 

 In an effort to get as many classes in as she could before the baby arrived Sammi started carrying a very heavy load including evening and some weekend classes. She was in her seventh month when God decided to shit on us. 

 I was in a deep hole with Burt Ellsworth replacing a gas main when my supervisor hollered at me to get out of the hole. I got out and he told me to hurry up and get in his truck. He started the truck and then told me he had to get me to the hospital. 

 "I just got a call from the office. Your wife was in an accident and is in the hospital." 

 "What happened? How is she?" 

 "I don't know anything kid. They just told me she was there and to hurry and get you there." 

 We got there and I rushed in and found that Sammi had fallen down a flight of stairs while hurrying to a class. She felt a sharp pain and started bleeding and she was rushed to the hospital. The fall caused her to miscarry and the doctor told me that there were complications and Sammi wouldn't be able to have any more children. It was a downer and it was driven home by the looks of pity that I got from all the nurses and orderlies.

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Everything changed. Sammi dropped out of school and just laid around the apartment and didn't do anything and by that I mean she didn't do anything at all. She didn't clean the apartment. She didn't cook any meals. She didn't take care of herself and she didn't have anything to do with me. She wouldn't talk to me and she kept herself as far away from me as she could which is no easy feat in a two bedroom apartment. I kept asking her what was wrong and she kept saying: 

 "Nothing is wrong with me damn it! Just leave me alone." 

 I put up with it for three weeks and then I decided we were going to have it out and I was going to get to the bottom of things. When I got home from work Sammi wasn't there. When she wasn't home by ten I started calling around and found out that she was at her parent's house. Her mother told me that Sammi didn't want to talk to me. 

 "What did you do to her?" 

 "I didn't do a damned thing" and then I told her about what had been going on. 

 "Give me a couple of days with her and I'll find out what is wrong." 

 It turned out that Sammi was suffering from post partum depression. My health insurance from work covered the treatment for us and Sammi slowly came around and life settled down for us. There were a few rough spots along the way, but we managed to work through them. 

 Sammi decided that she wasn't going to go back to school and she went looking for a job. She found one at Barrington Industries. She started out as a secretary and in six months she was promoted to administrative assistant to the director of marketing. The money was good, but I didn't care much for the job. It involved some late nights and an occasional Saturday as she had to attend some marketing function or other with her boss. I didn't like it, but I didn't feel that I could do anything about it at the time. It was still too close to her getting back on her feet and I didn't want to do anything that might cause her to take a step or two backward. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 A year after her promotion my life turned to shit! 

 Sammi told me that she had to go to a weekend seminar on Marketing Strategies with her boss. It was being held in Dallas and she would be flying out Friday and would be home Sunday around seven. She said while she was in Dallas she would visit with relatives on Saturday night so I shouldn't be concerned if I called her hotel and couldn't reach her. She was real excited about it because it could lead to another promotion. 

 "And we could use the money baby. The transmission on my car is acting up and the last guy I talked to about it said it could cost anywhere from nine hundred to eighteen hundred to take care of it." 

 I wasn't happy about it and we didn't really need the money because I still had the twelve grand in the bank for emergencies, but again, I didn't want to take the chance that I could cause her to go back into depression. 

 She left for work on Friday morning after kissing me goodbye and saying: 

 "Miss me baby. Be ready for a very horny Sammi when I get home." 

 I kept busy while she was gone and when she got home Sunday evening she was indeed very horny and as a result I fell asleep exhausted and then she ruined me again on Monday night. Tuesday when I got off work I found a large manila envelope underneath my driver's side windshield wiper. I opened it and my heart almost stopped. There were six pictures of Sammi along with a note that said: 

 "You don't deserve this dude. Get rid of the whore." 

 The pictures were of Sammi having sex with four men. Two of the pictures showed her doing three guys at once. I recognized two of the men from meeting them at her company Christmas party. One was the marketing director and the other was the owner of the company – Robert Connor Ellsworth Smythe-Barrington. 

 I sat in the car for almost an hour looking at the pictures and remembering all the late nights and Saturdays that Sammi had worked with the marketing director. By the time I got home my blood was boiling. When I got there I found that Sammi wasn't home. The light on the answering machine was blinking and I played the messages. The first was from some group backing a ballot measure of some sort. No idea of what because I deleted it as soon as I realized what it was. The second one was from Sammi. 

 "Sorry for the short notice baby, but an important client flew into town unexpectedly and we are meeting with him. I'll be late, but there are plenty of leftovers in the fridge. I'll make it up to you when I get home. Take a vitamin or three. Love you. Bye." 

 Lying cunt I thought as I deleted the message. Fucking your boss again no doubt. Then I had a thought. Maybe it wasn't her boss she was fucking. Maybe it was the client. Maybe it was both. Then again maybe it was the four guys I had pictures of having another go round. Whatever! It just didn't matter any more. 

 I used the time to pack up everything that I wanted and move it out to my pick up truck and then I made myself a stiff drink and settled down to wait for Sammi to come home. Sammi walked in the door at ten to ten and found me, drink in hand, on the couch. 

 "Oh goodie; you're still up" she said as she came over, bent down and kissed me. She sat down next to me and I said: 

 "Take care of the client?" 

 My voice had a slight edge to it and she noticed and said, "Don't be that way baby. It's my job." 

 "Oh? Are you pretty good at your job?" 

 "I must not be too bad. I've had several raises." 

 "I know. I've seen some of them and a couple that I couldn't see were obviously there." 

 She looked at me with a confused look so I picked up the envelope and took out the pictures. I leafed through them and pulled out the one of Barrington standing there with a hard on while watching the other three men making Sammi airtight. I handed it to her and said: 

 "I can see Barrington raised and while I can't see the other three I know that they have to be raised in order to do what they are doing." 

 I handed her the one of the marketing director buried in her ass and said: 

 "I can't see this one either, but you and I both know he was raised up at the time." 

 I handed her the other four and said, "You can put these in the photo album right next to our wedding pictures. That way you will have something to remind you of tonight. Goodbye Sammi" and I stood up and walked out as she screamed: 

 "Wait Bobby. Don't go. You don't understand. It was just a job." 

 The closing of the door cut off the "Please Bobby; we have to ta..." I drove until I came to a motel and I checked in for a couple of nights. I'd start looking for a place to live the next day. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I had about two weeks worth of vacation coming so in the morning I called the shift supervisor and told him I needed three days off for a family emergency. I had turned my cell phone off while I was driving away from Sammi because it rang and I saw that it was the home phone and I knew she would keep calling until I answered. When I turned it back on to call work I saw I had fourteen missed messages and seven voice mails and they were all from Sammi. I deleted them all and then decided to turn the phone off and only turn it on every couple of hours or so to check for messages that weren't from Sammi. 

 I had a productive morning. I stopped at the bank and cleaned out the accounts. If Sammi needed money too bad and fuck her. I looked at two apartments and one was in my price range so I signed up for a one bedroom unit and headed for Goodwill to see if I could find a bed. I got lucky and found a bed frame, a kitchen table with two chairs, a recliner and a TV table at a good price. I hit Mattress Factory and got a box spring and a mattress and that gave me enough to be able to move in and get started. By six I had everything in the apartment and all I had left to do was get some groceries. 

 Along the way I checked the phone a couple of times and there was nothing on it except for stuff from Sammi which I deleted. I stopped at Village Inn for dinner on my way to Safeway and I checked the phone again. A bunch from Sammi and one from my mother. I returned mom's call and she wanted to know what was going on. 

 "Samantha has called here several times and the poor girl is frantic because she can't get in touch with you." 

 "She can't get in touch with me because I don't want to talk to her" and then I proceeded to tell her why. 

 "That can't be right Bob. There has to be some mistake. Sammi loves you and would never do something like that to you." 

 "I have pictures of her doing it mom. With four different men. Sammi and I are history." 

 I called the landlord and told him that I'd moved out and that I would not be renewing the lease at the end of the month. I told him he should get in touch with Samantha to see if she wanted to keep it. 

 I went to a different bank and opened an account using the money I had taken out of my old bank and then even though I was on vacation for three days I went into work long enough to take Samantha off of my health insurance and remove her as the beneficiary on my company furnished life insurance and listed my folks instead. I arranged for my check which was direct deposit to go to my new bank and then I went to have a bite of lunch. 

 A check of my phone showed a plethora of missed messages and voice mails and all of them from Samantha and I decided to return a call and get talking with her over with. The receptionist informed me that Mrs. Walton had gone to lunch with Mr. Barrington and Mr. Steadman (the marketing director) and she asked if I would like to leave a message. I chuckled and said: 

 "Tell her that her about to be ex-husband is pleased to know she is getting more of those raises she was telling me about." 

 I hung up and headed for Kohl's to get some things to make my new home a little more comfortable and then stopped at Wal-Mart and bought m self a big screen TV set. 

 That evening I fixed myself my first evening meal as a newly separated husband. A check of the phone showed that Samantha was still trying to get in touch so I gambled that she would be home and not out earning raises. She answered on the third ring. 

 "Hello?" 

 "What do you want Samantha?" 

 "We have to talk Bobby. You have the wrong idea of what was going on." 

 "I'm not blind Samantha. There is absolutely no way I could misunderstand what I saw in those pictures." 

 "But you don't know why Bobby. That's what we need to talk about." 

 "No we don't Samantha. The why doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that you have been cheating on me. You have been fucking other men behind my back and lying to me wholesale. You aren't stupid Samantha. You had to have known how I would take it if I ever found out. You know it drove me nuts just to see you date other guys when we were in high school. Just what did you think I'd be like when I found out you were being a slut? Or maybe a whore would be a better description since whores do it for money and you were getting pay raises for spreading your legs. 

 "No Samantha; we have nothing to talk about. I have an appointment to see an attorney tomorrow and hopefully with his help I'll be able to get a quick divorce and get rid of your cheating ass." 

 "A divorce? Oh God no Bobby; not that. Please let me tal..." 

 I hung up on her and then turned the phone off. 

 My visit with Jared Hooper, attorney at law, was a shocker. I knew nothing about divorce so finding out that we lived in a state that had 'no fault' divorce laws and just what that meant was an eye opener. That Samantha could cheat with multiple men and that it didn't mean jack shit to the courts just blew me away. That I'd probably end up paying her alimony because she only made about half as much as I did seemed to me that she was being rewarded for her infidelity and I was being punished for taking exception to it. 

 That she would get half of everything in a divorce wasn't that much of a concern because we didn't have much. The furniture in the apartment, my truck, her car and of course the money that we'd had in the bank. Even though I'd stripped the accounts and had it in an account under my name only didn't matter. The courts would still order me to give her half. Then I was informed that the odds were seventy-thirty in her favor that I would end up paying her attorney if she fought the divorce. It just seemed so damned unfair. 

 The attorney did tell me that there was one bright side to it. There were no children so I wouldn't be saddled with child support. "Oh Whoopie!" I thought. The only good thing about it was that all the information was free. I'd made the appointment with Hooper because he had advertised that the initial consultation was free. 

 I decided to take some time to think it over and see if I had other options. I'd heard about quickie divorces in Reno so maybe there were some alternatives to a no fault divorce and I needed to look into it. Maybe, I thought, just don't get a divorce. Use the money a divorce would cost to go back to school. I liked my job with the gas company, but the best I would ever be able to do was maybe get to be a crew foreman or a shift supervisor and even then I was probably looking at ten to fifteen years before it could happen. 

 I stopped for lunch after leaving the attorney's office and checked my phone. There were the usual from Samantha and I deleted them, but there was one voice mail that intrigued me. 

 "Good morning Mr. Walton. My name is Rob Barrington and I would appreciate your giving me a call. I would like to discuss something that could be to our mutual benefit." 

 He gave me a number to call and then said that he hoped that he would hear from me soon. I do have to admit that I was very, very curious as to what one of my wife's fuckers wanted to talk to me about and I almost called him. Almost. But I didn't. I knew, in my mind anyway, that if I called he would want a 'face to face' and I knew that if I were to agree to meet him the first thing I would do after getting close to him would put me behind bars if not finding me being strapped down on the electric chair. 

 In the afternoon I went over to the college and checked into what I needed to do to re-enroll. When I sat down to dinner that night my mind was made up. I was going to go back to school. I would have to take evening classes to do it and that would mean giving up the overtime I was usually able to get to swell my paycheck, but it would have to be done. It wouldn't be too hard at first because I still had that twelve grand in savings that was left over from my college fund. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day I went back to work and found that Samantha had called and left a dozen or so messages. I told Sarah at the front desk that my wife and I had separated and not to bother taking any more messages from Samantha. 

 I was still keeping my phone turned off and checking for messages a couple of times a day. I was getting anywhere from twelve to eighteen missed messages and voice mails a day from my wife, but occasional there were other messages too. There were two more from Barrington and a couple from Samantha's parents. I really liked them and I really should have called them, but if I did they would want to know what was going on and I couldn't tell them. 

 I got careless. I was constantly deleting every thing I got from Samantha, but I wasn't paying any attention to what other ways she might try to use to get to me so I didn't notice the car that followed me home from work. I pulled into the parking lot and parked. I got out and walked up to my door not realizing that I was being followed until I got to my door and stopped to get out my key. That is when I heard the footsteps behind me. I turned and found Samantha behind me. She smiled at me and said: 

 "Hi baby." 

 I ignored her, turned and unlocked my door and started to open it, fully intending to step inside and the close it in Samantha's face. I guess she anticipated that and she rushed forward and pushed me. I stumbled into the apartment and she quickly followed me in and closed the door behind her. 

 "Now we can talk" she said. 

 I said nothing and took off my coat and hung it up. I went to the fridge and got myself a beer and as I was opening it Samantha asked: 

 "Got one for me?" 

 "No. I've got just enough to get me through the tonight. I can't spare one for a whore." 

 "I am not a whore! I did what I did for us." 

 "How does your being a gangbang whore do anything for us?" 

 "Damn it Bobby; I am not a gangbanging whore." 

 "You are forgetting that I've seen the pictures of you doing three men at once and that by anyone's definition is a gangbang. And I fail to see how that was doing anything for us." 

 "I didn't mean to do it Bobby. Mr. Barrington took me to lunch one day and he put some date rape stuff in my drink then he let two other guys have me while he filmed it. He told me that he would send you a copy of the film if I didn't care of a few clients of his. The next day he told me that he thought I was sexy and if I would agree to be his girlfriend he would make sure the film was destroyed and he would give me twenty-five thousand dollars to use as a down payment on a house. I was going to tell you that I won the money buying lottery tickets. You were never supposed to find out what I was doing. It was for us Bobby. Our very own home." 

 "So you really are a whore. That's what whores do you know. Fuck men for money." 

 "I did it for us Bobby. To get us out of that small apartment and into a house where we could raise kids and be happy." 

 "You can't have kids anymore or did you forget that?" 

 "We would adopt Bobby. We could still have a family. I love you Bobby. Those men meant nothing to me. They were simply the means to get me to the end of the six months so I could get the down payment for our house. Honest to God Bobby; those men meant nothing to me. You are the man I love and want to be with." 

 "The problem Samantha is that I no longer want to be with you. Your story doesn't hold up. Six months and you would get money? You have been there over a year and a half. Seeing you with a cock in all your holes killed every feeling that I ever had for you. I can't stand even looking at you now. Just get the fuck out of here and leave me alone." 

 "You don't mean that" she said as she started taking off her blouse and skirt. She had come prepared. There was no bra or panties under her clothes. She stood there naked in front of me and she smiled as she said: 

 "Tell me that you can't stand looking at this." 

 I stood there looking at her for maybe half a minute or so and then I took my cock out and started walking toward her. Her smile got bigger and she opened her arms to me. Her smile quickly disappeared as I started pissing on her. She backed up to get away from the stream, but two steps put her with her back to the door. As she moved back I followed and kept the stream going until I was down to shaking the last drops off of it. I took her arm, pulled her away from the door and then opened it. She hadn't yet recovered from the shock of being pissed on so she hadn't realized what was coming. I pusher her naked body out the open door, reached down and picked up her clothes, damp from the urine that had fallen on them, and tossed them outside. 

 "Stay away from me you fucking slut! Just leave me the fuck alone!" 

 I slammed the door closed and locked it. I got my beer from where I'd set it down, chugged it and then set about cleaning up the mess I'd made. 

 I guess what I'd said and done had gotten through to Samantha because the calls from her to my phone stopped. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next three days slid by and then one evening as I was watching a TV program there was a knock on my door. Thinking that it might be Samantha I looked through the peep hole in the door. It wasn't Samantha; it was a cop. I opened the door and saw two of them standing there. One of them asked:  

 

 

===

"Mr. Walton?" 

 "Yes." 

 "Is your wife Samantha Sue Walton?" 

 "Yes. What's this about?" 

 "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you wife was killed in an accident a short time ago." 

 I stood there stunned as he asked me to accompany them to the hospital. 

 "Hospital? You said she was killed." 

 "She was. She died in the hospital emergency room. We need you, as next of kin, to make a positive identification." 

 It was Samantha. I asked them what had happened. 

 "She came out of Farrell's Bar and Grill and stepped off the sidewalk in front of a truck. According to the blood work up the hospital did when she was brought in she was well past the limits of being legally drunk. Witnesses said that it didn't look like she knew what she was doing. Was everything all right between you and your wife?" 

 "Why do you ask that?" 

 "Two of the witnesses said that it looked like she deliberately stepped out in front of the truck. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 Samantha's father was out of the country on business and her mother broke down and had to be sedated when she heard the news so it fell on me to make the final arrangements. Her dad get home in time for the funeral and Samantha's mother was there, but she was still a little drugged up. 

 After the funeral my dad reminded me that I needed to stop by his office and fill out the forms. 

 "What forms?" 

 "You have to file a claim to collect on the life insurance." 

 I'd forgotten about that. My dad was an insurance salesman and when Samantha and I had gotten married he had talked us into buying insurance on each other. We had a 125K policy on each other and it paid double indemnity in case of accidental death. That reminded me that I also had a 25K policy on her as part of the benefits package offered by the gas company. It also had a double indemnity clause for accidental death and I remembered Samantha telling me that she had life insurance on us as part of her benefits package. 

 The next day I went to the old apartment and moved all of Samantha's thinks into storage. I'd wait until her mother was back on her feet and then talk to her about what to do with the stuff. When that was done I headed over to my dad's office and I filed claims for the insurance. 

 The insurance that I had through the gas company and the insurance that Samantha had through Barrington Industries paid up, but the company that backed the insurance my dad sold us balked at paying. They said that there was cause to doubt that Samantha's death was accidental and that in fact it could have been suicide and the policy had a clause stating suicide was not covered. 

 I had 50k from my company policy and 30k from Samantha's company policy and I debated just saying to hell with it where the 125k policy was concerned, but my dad wouldn't hear of it. 

 "You get an attorney and go after those assholes. They have no proof or evidence that it was suicide. All they have is that two witnesses out of the eleven that saw it say that they 'thought' it looked like she stepped in front of the truck deliberately." 

 I did what my dad suggested and after two months the insurance company paid up. After the lawyer took his cut I got 195K out of the deal, but the lawyer went even farther. He went after the trucking company. It turned out that the driver had a blood/alcohol content of .04 which was well above the legal limit and the company settled and I ended up with another 65K. 

 Suddenly I wasn't just looking at going to school part time in the evenings. I could afford to quit my job and go to school full time. I went into work and gave two weeks notice. The shift supervisor looked at it and asked why and I told him. He asked what I was going to study and I told him I was looking to get a degree in Civil Engineering. He wished me luck and I left his office to work my shift. 

 Two days later when I got to work I was called into the shift supervisor's office and he told me that I needed to go upstairs and see Mr. Pearlman. 

 "About what?" 

 "Mr. Pearlman will tell you." 

 Pearlman was Director of Operations and what he had to say floored me. He offered to change my resignation to a leave of absence and told me that if I signed a contract to work for the gas company for three years after my graduation the company would pick up half of my books and tuition and I could work for the company as an intern on my breaks. It was a no brainer and I asked: 

 "Where do I sign." 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

The next two years flew by. I was doing well in my classes and I made a lot of friends. I didn't join a fraternity, but I knew lots of guys who did belong and occasionally I would get invited to a party at a frat house. I was at one of those parties at the Phi Delta house when fate smiled upon me. 

 I was at the beer keg getting my cup refilled when Sammy Bealer said: 

 "Don't look now, but I think you have an admirer." 

 "What the hell are you talking about?" 

 "I'm talking about that little honey at your three o'clock. She hasn't taken her eyes off of you." 

 I moved to fill my cup and took a look. I didn't know her name, but I recognized her. She was in two of my classes. She was looking our way, but that didn't mean that she was looking at me. 

 "Maybe it's you she is looking at Sammy." 

 "Nah! It is definitely you. Who is she?" 

 "No idea. I've seen her around. She's in two of my classes, but I don't know her. Besides, she has to be here with a date. Girls don't come to these parties alone. At least good girls don't." 

 "She might have come with someone else, but from the way she is looking at you I'd be willing to bet that she would leave with you if you wanted." 

 "Well I don't want. I'm staying clear of the opposite sex until I get school out of the way. Broads are too much of a distraction." 

 "What's wrong with you man? I can't go two weeks without wanting to get laid so how are you going to go another year?" 

 "In the first place I've only got six more months to go to have the hundred and thirty-five credit hours I need for my degree and secondly will power. Will power Sammy; supreme will power" I said as I was thinking "and a financial relationship with Mona from the Elite Escort Agency." 

 I didn't think the girl was looking at me, but as the party progressed and I moved around socializing I did notice that she always seemed to be close to where I was and she did seem to be always looking in my direction. She was a fine looking lady and in truth if I wasn't of the mind set that I wasn't going to have a woman in my life until I had my degree I probably would have gone after her. 

 However, where the female of the species is concerned nothing is ever set in concrete. I was at the keg refilling my cup again when Johnny DuBois walked up to get a refill and casually said to me: 

 "What's your secret Rob? You have a ten inch dick or a twelve inch tongue?" 

 "What? Are you drunk?" 

 "Not yet, but I'm working on it. Just wondering what the attraction is. CB hasn't taken her eyes off of you since you got here." 

 "Who? Who is CB?" 

 "Connie Barrington. Actually it is Connie Smythe-Barrington, but she doesn't use the Smythe part." 

 All of a sudden I was interested in the girl who was supposedly eyeing me. 

 "Why would she be watching me? Surely her date would have something to say about it." 

 "Her date was Barry Cross and Barry can't handle liquor. He's been passed out for the last two hours. Guys have been hitting on her ever since a couple of them carried him up to a bedroom, but you are the guy she seems to be interested in. You could do worse dude. Her family is loaded." 

 Smythe-Barrington? There couldn't be another family with that name. She had to be related to Robert Conner Ellsworth Smythe- Barrington and an idea began forming in the back of my mind. I had no idea of whether or not it would work, but I made the instant decision to try. 

 I set my beer down and walked over to the girl and said, "I've been fighting it all night, but I've decided that the British SAS have it right. "Who Dares Wins" is their motto and I've decided to adopt it where you are concerned." 

 I offered my hand as I introduced myself. She took my hand and said, "I was just getting ready to do the same thing only in my mind it was "Carpe Diem" - - seize the day." 

 "Who do I have to fight to get you to leave with me?" 

 "No one. He is already down for the count." 

 I offered her my arm and said, "Shall we?" 

 She took my arm and said "Yes" and seven months later Connie was pregnant and I was walking away. I won't pretend that it was easy because it wasn't. I had grown quite attached to Connie and I could see a future with her under different circumstances, but my hatred where her father was concerned was a great deal stronger than my feelings for his daughter. I admit that it was despicable of me to get at him through his daughter, but I couldn't see any other way to take my revenge without putting me in jail for assault with intent to kill or maim. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 A week went by and it was reminiscent of my breakup with Samantha. A dozen calls a day on my cell from Connie that I deleted. I had finished school so I didn't have to worry about running into her on campus and I'd never talked about the gas company with her so she didn't know where I worked. But she did know where I lived so I had to keep an eye out for her in case she tried to catch me at home. 

 Twice I saw her car in the parking lot at the apartments and when I saw it I kept on driving. I knew that sooner or later, probably sooner rather than later, she would knock on the door while I was home, but I didn't plan to open the door to her. 

 The next week the number of calls increased and I kept deleting them until the day came that I had been waiting for. There were the usual dozen voice mails and I started deleting them until I came to the fifth one. 

 "Mr. Walton? My name is Rob Barrington and I need to talk with you. Would you please call me at" and he gave me a number to call and ended the voice mail telling me that it was very important to call him as soon as possible. 

 I smiled as I thought "Gotcha!" 

 I waited until the next morning and then I called the number. 

 "Good morning. Thank you for calling Barrington Industries. How may I direct your call?" 

 "Mr. Barrington please." 

 Two rings and then, "Mr. Barrington's office. This is Stella. How may I help you?" 

 "Mr. Barrington please." 

 "Whom shall I say is calling?" 

 "Bob Walton." 

 Two rings and then, "This is Marge. How can I help you?" 

 "I'm trying to reach Mr. Barrington." 

 "I'm Mr. Barrington's executive assistant." 

 "I don't care if you are Mother Teresa. I'm trying to reach Mr. Barrington." 

 "Mr. Barrington is a very busy man and it is my job to see that he isn't interrupted every time some one calls." 

 "God knows that I would never want to interrupt a very busy man, but Mr. Barrington called me, left his number and said that it was very important that I call him as soon as possible. Apparently it can't be all that important or he would have arranged to have me put right through. Good day" and I hung up. I was not surprised when my phone rang three minutes later and the screen showed that the call was from the number I'd just hung up on. I smiled and let it go to voice mail and then deleted it without listening to it. 

 I had three calls from that number over the next two days and I ignored them. I started parking on the other side of my apartment complex and then walking to my apartment thinking that if Connie didn't see my car she would think I wasn't home. Of course I did have to be careful and make sure she wasn't already parked where she could see me enter my unit. Twice I saw her sitting in her car and I had to go back to mine and go somewhere for dinner and a drink or two to wait her out. 

 The calls from Barrington stopped and I wondered what he would do next. He wasn't the type to just shrug his shoulders and give up. He was a Smythe- Barrington for God's sake. No lowly peon was going to be allowed to ignore him. 

 When it came I was surprised. I was at a job site going over the plans with the crew chief when what was obviously an unmarked police car drove onto the site. A man in a suit got out and asked one of the workers something and I saw Mike turn and point to me. The man in the suit came over to me and introduced himself as Detective Sergeant O'Conner. 

 "I'd like you to come with me please." 

 "What's this about? Am I under arrest?" 

 "No you aren't under arrest and I don't know what it is about. I was just asked to fetch you." 

 "Do I need an attorney?" 

 "No. I don't know what it is about, but I do know you do not need a lawyer." 

 "Do I follow you in my car?" 

 "No. I'll bring you back when it is over." 

 "At least that sounds like I'm not going to be locked up. Let's go." 

 During the ride my mind was busy trying to think of why the police wanted to talk to me. My only contact with the authorities had been when Samantha was killed. I'd never even had a parking ticket much less anything worse. I was confused when we didn't go to a police station or the City County Building, but instead pulled into a visitors parking place at Barrington Industries, 

 "Impressive" I said. "I knew Barrington was wealthy and influential, but to own the police department? I'm impressed." 

 O'Conner didn't respond to that. He got out of the car and I followed him. He led the way through the lobby to the elevators and walked up to the one on the left. He took a key card out of his pocket and swiped it through the reader next to the elevator door and the door opened and we stepped inside. There were only three buttons on the panel which I though odd since it was a six story building. One said up and that's the one O'Conner pushed. The other two said "Down 1" and "Down 2." 

 On the ride up I asked "Down 1 and 2?" 

 "Down one is the lobby where we got on. Down 2 is the basement parking garage." 

 The door opened onto a reception area and O' Conner said to the woman behind the desk: 

 "Mr. Walton to see Mr. Barrington." 

 The woman picked up the phone, pushed a button and a second later said, "He's here." 

 A minute later a smartly dressed and very good looking woman came into the reception area and walked up to me. 

 "Good morning Mr. Walton. I'm Marge and I'm sorry for the mix up the day you called. If you would please follow me?" 

 She turned and started walking and as I followed along behind her I couldn't help but notice her ass and think that I'd follow that ass any day of the week. She led me to a door, opened and ushered me in as she announced "Mr. Walton is here" and then she closed the door and left me facing Robert Conner Ellsworth Smythe-Barrington. He stood, offered his hand and said: 

 "Good morning Mr. Walton. May I call you Bob?" 

 I didn't take his hand and I didn't respond to the question. I just stood there looking at him. He pulled his hand back, shrugged and said: 

 "Please have a seat." 

 I sat down on a chair opposite him and he said, "I'm sure that you know why you are here." 

 "I guess that for some reason you wanted me to see that you own a police department." 

 He chuckled and said, "Hardly. Terry is one of my cousins. Family you know. I believe that you know my daughter Constance?" 

 "I do." 

 "She tells me that she has a problem and that you are the cause. I wanted to talk to you and see if we could come to some sort of an agreement to solve the problem." 

 "If it is the problem she mentioned the last time I talked to her I doubt that we will be able to reach any agreement at all." 

 "What kind of man are you that you can't step up and be responsible for your actions?" 

 "You are mistaken. I have no problem taking ownership of my actions, but I am not responsible for your daughter's condition. I am sterile. I can not get a woman pregnant." 

 "Constance swears to me that you are the only one she had sexual relations with and she has never in her life lied to me." 

 "Your daughter was not a virgin when we first had sex. I have no idea of how many that there were before me, but it is plainly obvious that there was some one else getting her while we were keeping company. You need to find out who that someone is and try to work out an agreement with him." 

 "Lets cut out the bullshit and get right to it shall we? Constance said it was you so as far as I'm concerned it was you. How much do you want?" 

 "For what?" 

 "To marry Constance and give the child a father." 

 "How much you got?" 

 He smiled. As far as he was concerned he was now on familiar ground. Money would take care of the problem. Now all he had to do was figure out how cheaply I could be bought. 

 "Constance says you know about her trust fund and that she will come into it when she marries. I won't insist on a pre-nup. Do we have a deal?" 

 "Are you seriously asking me to take on some one else's kid for that? I'm no legal genius, but even I know that in a divorce any judge worth his salt is going to look at that trust and say that it is hers and hers alone." 

 "Divorce?" 

 "Of course divorce. She was going with me and still managed to get pregnant with some other guy's kid and tried to pass it off on me. She would be cheating on me before our first anniversary. Sooner or later I would catch her and then divorce her." 

 "Constance says that the baby is yours and I believe her. She would not lie to me about something like that." 

 "Bullshit! If she would lie to me about it she would damned sure lie about it to you to get you on her side. I don't know who the father of her baby is other than it is not me. For all I know it could be yours." 

 "HOW DARE YOU!" he yelled as he leaned forward and banged his fist on his desk like a judge's gavel. 

 "How dare I? You are a low life asshole who fucks other men's wives so it isn't any great leap to think you might be creep enough to do you own daughter." 

 "That is an absolute outright lie!" 

 "Get off your high horse Bobby. I have pictures of you fucking my wife. You, Steadman and two others." 

 "You are out of your fucking mind!" 

 "Give it up Bobby. You can huff and puff and bluster all you want, but I have pictures of you fucking Samantha and I'm not the least bit afraid to paper this entire state with copies of them. Before she died she confessed to me that you offered her twenty-five thousand to take care of you, Steadman and certain select clients and customers." 

 He sat back in his chair, sudden understanding on his face. 

 "Walton. You are Sammi Walton's husband. I never made the connection." 

 Then his eyes got big as the realization hit him. "YOU BASTARD!!! It was on purpose! You got my daughter pregnant to get back at me." 

 "You are free to think that I seduced your daughter to get back at you for seducing my wife if you want, but the fact still remains that I am sterile." 

 "Seduce your wife? That's what you think? I've got news for you boy. Your wife was a grade A slut. She was a hot, sexy looking woman and men naturally hit on her. The problem was that when they hit on her she dropped her drawers and spread fore them. She wasn't here an hour and she was sucking Stedman's dick. He took her to lunch at the Marriott and spent the afternoon fucking her. She was that easy." 

 "Yeah! Right! Like I'm going to believe that." 

 He stood up and went to a credenza against the wall, dug around in it until he came out with a couple of CDs in his hand. He opened a desk drawer and took out a file folder and then said: 

 "Follow me boy. I've got a few things to show you." 

 Curious, I got up and followed him out of the room and down the hall to a conference room. It had a large screen TV against one wall and a VCR/CD player hooked up to it. 

 "I am a very careful man. I'm well aware that there are people always willing to try and separate me from my money and I make sure my ass is covered at all times. Pay attention to the dates that you see on these recordings." 

 He set things up and pushed the button that started things. On the screen I saw the same room that I was sitting in. There were four men sitting at the table I was sitting at and Stedman walked into the room followed by Samantha. The date on the tape was her first day on the job. Steadman said: 

 "Gentlemen, let me introduce our newest employee Samantha Walton. She prefers to be called Sammi. When I interviewed her for the open secretary's position I asked her what her qualifications were and after telling me about her typing and computer skills she got up and came around my desk, told me she had one more skill I might appreciate and then proceeded to give me the best blow job I've ever gotten. I told her that we were a very close knit group here and then I informed here that if I hired her I would be honor bound to share my good fortune and she said it would not be a problem. Please welcome her to our department." 

 What followed was a gangbang that Barrington said lasted until well after quitting time. "And that was in addition to the three hours she spent with Stedman at the Marriott." 

 He put another CD in the player and on the screen was Barrington sitting behind his desk. The door opened and Marge ushered Samantha into the office and then left. Barrington asked her to have a seat and then said: 

 "Marty (Stedman) tells me that you have a certain skill that could be useful to the company. To be blunt about it certain customers, clients and suppliers need an extra incentive to give us the best prices, priority on deliveries and to sign contracts that are beneficial to us. You are a beautiful and sexy looking young woman and I can see where most men who see you are going to want you. The time you spent in the conference room yesterday makes me believe that you might be willing to take on the job of -- shall we say -- accounts facilitator? How would you feel about that?" 

 Samantha looked him right in the eye and said, "I'm not about to fuck whoever you want for secretaries wages." 

 "Of course not and I wouldn't expect you too. Which would you prefer? A straight salary or a base salary plus commissions?" 

 I think a secretary's salary and commissions. I would want the salary to go as direct deposit into the joint account I have with my husband and the commissions to go into a separate account that I'll set up at a different bank." 

 "We can do that. I'll set you up with an apartment where you can entertain and an expense account for buying the clothes and whatever else is necessary for you to take care of business. Things like drinks and such. Are you willing to start today?" 

 "I am." 

 "Jason Willard will arrive at nine this morning on his flight from Dallas. You and Marty will have lunch with him to discuss the details of the contract we want him to sign. After lunch you will see to it that Jason enjoys his trip. Okay?" 

 "Don't you at least want to see what you are sending Mr. Willard?" she said as she stood up and went behind his desk. She knelt in front of him and proceeded to give him a blow job that included swallowing. 

 "As you can see there was precious little seducing going on where Sammi was concerned. So yes, I did fuck your wife, but I did not have to seduce her to do it. There is more. Even though I'm not above giving the people I do business with incentives I am very careful when it comes to what I do give them. I don't want things backfiring and coming back on me. I have an extremely good private investigator on retainer and I put him on Samantha to find out what he could about her. He went all the way back to her high school days and talked with anybody who would talk to him. What he found was that she pretty much liked to fuck." 

 He slid the file he had taken out of his desk and slid it across the table to me. 

 "Read that and then tell me again about how I seduced your innocent wife. I'll give you some time with that and then I'll be back. I've got some calls to make." 

 He left the room and I opened the file and saw that he did indeed have an extremely good investigator working for him. He had gone all the way back to high school. Samantha had been a round heeled slut. I had been so hung up over her that I had never noticed. I knew that she had dated several other guys before settling on me, but I hadn't known that she had fucked most of them. Even after starting to go steady with me she was fucking other guys. She fucked other guys after we were married and she fucked other guys all through her pregnancy.  

 

 

===

It was all a shock to me, but the biggest shock to me was finding out something that never in my wildest imagination would I have thought. The baby that Samantha had been carrying was not mine. The baby had been black. Suddenly I remembered the looks of pity that I had gotten from the workers at the hospital. It wasn't because Samantha couldn't have any more children. It was because they pitied the poor clueless husband. 

 I was sitting there staring at the report when Barrington came back into the room. He sat down opposite me and then sat there watching me. After a bit he said: 

 "I'm sorry that I had to be the one to ruin your memories of your wife, but unfortunately I not the kind of person who when accused of something just shrugs and walks away. All I did where Sammi was concerned is take what was offered." 

 I sat there staring at the report and finally he said, "Are you all right?" 

 I looked up at him and said, "If it was your wife and you read this would you be all right?" 

 "Probably not." 

 "This comes as a total shock. I knew about what she was doing here and I'd all ready left her over it, but the rest of it? I had no idea. The part about the baby? She was playing me for a sucker even back then. We had to get married because she told me I had gotten her pregnant and all the time it was some other asshole." 

 "Maybe, but then again maybe not. Maybe she did think it was yours." 

 I stood up and he asked, "Where are you going?" 

 "I have some serious thinking to do." 

 "What about Constance?" 

 "I just said it; I have some serious thinking to do. Would you please have your secretary call me a cab?" 

 "No need. Terry is downstairs waiting for you." 

 I sensed he wanted to say more, but he kept silent. 

 Terry stood up when I got to the lobby and headed for the door. The ride back to the job site was silent and I stared out the passenger's side window and thought. The mornings events had blunted the hatred I'd felt toward Barrington. Finding out that he hadn't done what Samantha had said had changed things. Connie was pregnant because of my hatred of her father because of what I had believed that he had done. 

 By the time we got back to the job site I knew what I had to do. It wasn't going to be pleasant, but it would have to be done. After making sure that the crew chief was up to speed on the plans I got in my car and told out my cell and called Barrington. This time I was put right through. Once I got him on the phone I asked: 

 "How is your relationship with your daughter? Specifically, how would she take knowing that you were fucking my wife?" 

 "Why?" 

 "Just humor me." 

 "It would probably upset her, but it would come as no surprise. She knows that I haven't had sexual relations with her mother in over ten years and no, the why of it isn't any of your business." 

 "I don't need to know anyway. I need the CDs and the detectives report. Can I pick them up this afternoon?" 

 "Why do you want them?" 

 "If your daughter wants to marry me after I go over them with her you will have gained a son in law." 

 "Is that really necessary? That you go over them with her?" 

 "It is to me. I won't go forward with her until I have done it." 

 "I'll have the package waiting for you at the front desk. All I ask is that you.....never mind. The stuff will be there." 

 I took a deep breath and called Connie. I got her voice mail. I left the message that we needed to talk face to face and that I'd be home after six. I swung by Barrington Industries and picked up the package and went home. 

 At six I expected my doorbell to ring, but it didn't. Seven came and went without Connie showing up or calling so I decided that she didn't want to talk and I decided to go out and get a bite to eat. I was just opening the door when Connie walked up to it. 

 "Sorry I'm late, but I forgot and left my phone at home on the charger and I didn't get your message until twenty minutes ago. Why the rush now when you have been avoiding me for weeks?" 

 "It isn't a rush. If you hadn't shown up tonight I would have called you again tomorrow." 

 I stepped aside and said, "Please come in." 

 She came in and I led her to the kitchen table and pulled out a chair for her and then I got a glass and poured some white wine which was her usual alcoholic drink of choice. I popped the top on a long neck and sat down opposite her. 

 "I'm going to tell you a story. You are not going to like certain parts of it, but it has to be done." 

 I proceeded to tell her about Samantha and how she had cheated on me and how she had blamed it on Robert Barrington and what he did to her. I only covered the period that Samantha had worked for Barrington Industries and then I said: 

 "I promised myself that I would get even with the man who caused my wife to cheat on me. I believed that man to be your father and I set out to hurt him the only way I knew how given my limited resources. I knew how socially conscious he was and I figured he would be shamed in his social circles if he ended up with a pregnant unmarried daughter so I deliberately set out to woo you, impregnate you and then send you home to daddy. 

 "I probably never would have been able to do it without the help of the guy who fed you that date rape drug because I really believed you meant it when you said you wouldn't have sex until you were married. But he did prime you for me and I did get you pregnant on either that night or later ones." 

 "You bastard!! You did it to me on purpose." 

 "Yes I did. Today your father had me visit him at his office and while I didn't admit anything to him I accused he of doing something very bad and when he challenged my accusation I told him I had no trouble believing what I'd said because a man capable of seducing and then screwing another man's wife was capable of doing anything. 

 "He asked me what I meant by that and I told him what my wife had confessed to. He told me that I was wrong and then he showed me the proof. I want you to play these CDs and read this report. I'm going to go sit in the spare bedroom and when you are done and you still want to talk to me come and knock on the door." 

 Twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and I opened it and we went back into the kitchen. I refilled her wine glass and she took a sip and then said: 

 "Why did you want me to see that?" 

 "It wasn't so you could see your dad doing things; it was so you could see what my wife was doing. When I found out what she was doing I confronted her and she told me that she was fed date rape drugs, given to friends of your father's and that he filmed it and threatened to send me the film if she didn't do what he wanted. I firmly believed that she was cheating on me because of your father and I set out to get revenge on him. I didn't have the money and power that your father had so I went after him the only way I could think of that wouldn't have me ending up in a jail cell. I went at him through you. 

 "As you saw from the report and how she behaved on the CDs she lied to me. She lied to me and I went after your father to take my revenge. It is important to me that you see why I did what I did. I do not expect you to accept my reasoning and what I did, but I do hope that you at least have some understanding of the why. 

 "That said and given what you now know it is time for you to think about making some decisions. I will step up and take on my responsibilities as the father of your child, but you will need to decide the form that responsibility takes. I will of course marry you, but you have to decide if you want to married to a man who could do what I have done. If you do decide to marry and give the child legitimacy you have to decide what kind of marriage it will be." 

 "What does that mean? What kind of marriage?" 

 "I honestly can't see where you would want anything to do with me under the circumstances so you might decide you only want to appear to be happily married in public and you might prefer separate quarters when we are at home. You may decide that you would rather be an unmarried mother than have to marry me. If we do marry you will have to decide how long you want it to last. Six months after the baby comes? A year? You might decide to marry me and then divorce me after two or three months. That way you won't be saddled with me and you will have avoided the tag of un-wed mother and the satin that goes with it. These are all decisions that you have to make." 

 "So you never cared for me at all. I was just the vehicle you used to get at my father." 

 "That isn't true. I did have feelings for you. Strong feelings. Unfortunately my feelings for you were overpowered by my hatred of your father." 

 She stared at me in silence for almost a minute and then she said, "I'll need a list of whom you want to invite to the wedding. I'm not quite sure how quick it will be, but I'm sure that my mother is going to want it to happen before I begin to show. You are going to need to clear your schedule. It will be necessary that we be seen in public as a couple. This Saturday there is a charity event that will be well attended by the social set that you intended to embarrass my father in front of. I will get you a list of other events we will need to attend. You will need a tux for two of them." 

 She stood up and said, "I'll call you tomorrow with the details for Saturday. No need to see me out. I know the way." 

 That of course was pure sarcasm as you could see the apartment door from the table where we were sitting. When she reached the door she turned and said: 

 "We will need to start looking for a suitable house. I'm afraid I'm just not an apartment person." 

 And then she was gone and just like that I had a fiancée. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day I stopped by a jewelry store and bought the rings and when I got home I opened the Yellow Pages and found a place where I could buy a tux. They had a full page ad and it said "Call for a fitting" so I called and made an appointment. I'd no sooner got off the phone from talking to them when the phone rang. It was Connie calling with the details of the Saturday event. 

 "And I'll need your list as soon as possible. My mother picked a date six weeks away." 

 "I'll give it to you on Saturday." 

 I was surprised that she was still sharing the apartment with Harriet and Gwen. I would have thought that when she graduated she would have gotten a place of her own. Luckily neither one was there when I picked Connie up. I really didn't want to face Harriet after using her the way I had. Once in the car I handed her the engagement ring I'd bought her and she looked at it for a bit and then slid it on her finger. Not a romantic moment by any means, but there wasn't any romance in the situation to begin with. 

 I met Connie's mother for the first time and she seemed like a lovely lady. She was surprisingly friendly with me considering the circumstances and we discussed the coming wedding. 

 "The quickness of it will cause questions, but it won't be the first time a couple had to do things in a hurry. You must come see me some time when we can talk longer and in private." 

 I told her that I would, but I wasn't all that sure that I meant it. I knew that one of the things she was going to want to talk about was why I was marrying her daughter after going out of my way to deny paternity of Connie's child and I didn't want her to know why and I didn't want to make up some lie to tell her that I'd have to try and remember. 

 Her father acted toward me like we'd never had that conversation in his office. I met a ton of important people most of whose names I wouldn't remember come the next day. It was a pleasant evening and I didn't embarrass myself or Connie. Connie was well known and quite popular. She was asked a dozen times and she always looked to me to see if it was all right and I'd nod a yes. 

 On the drive home Connie said, "My mother likes you." 

 "I suppose there is no accounting for taste." 

 "You don't understand. My mother has never, and I do mean never, liked any of the guys I've dated and introduced to her." 

 "Your mother is well aware of the circumstances under which we are getting married and she has decided to make the best of it." 

 "Oh no; I know my mom and I can tell. She really likes you and I don't mind telling you that it surprises the hell put of me." 

 I made the turn to take her home and she asked, "Where are you going? This isn't the way to your place." 

 "My place?" 

 "I can't fuck you with my roommates around so yes, your place." 

 I glanced over at her and she said, "Don't look at me like that. You like sex and we are getting married and since you have already knocked me up and I like sex it is only natural that we get it on." 

 Get it on? Knocked me up? The word "fuck?" She never used to talk like that. I wondered what other surprises she had for me. I hung a u-turn and headed for my apartment. Connie was shedding clothes even as we walked in the door. She headed straight for the bedroom and was naked and spread out on the bed when I finally got my clothes off.. 

 "Eat me" she commanded and I wondered about that. Before she had always followed my lead and she had never before told me what to do. I shrugged and got down to do it and found the next surprise she had for me. As soon as my mouth was on her pussy I knew that I was following someone else. I raised my head and looked at her and she had a smile on her face. 

 "Suck him out of me darling. It is your punishment for the hell that you put me through. Clean him out of me and then you can fill me back up." 

 It wouldn't be the first time for me and I knew that it wouldn't kill me. I remembered a gangbang at a frat house and a hundred dollar bet and a dare that I wouldn't eat the girl after she was banged. I took the bet and she had liked it so much that she had given me her phone number and made me promise to call, but I never did. 

 I looked into Connie's smiling face and then went to work. As I licked and slurped she told me how she had snuck away during the party and allowed herself to be fucked. 

 "Twice baby. I took two loads tonight." She paused and then said, "From two different guys." 

 She moaned and pushed her cunt up my face. "That's it baby; that's just right. Suck all of them out of meeeeeeee" she yelled as she came. She grabbed my head and held it tight against her until the shaking slacked off and she came down. I pulled my face away from her, pulled and pushed until I got her in the doggie position and then I rammed my cock into her cunt and started banging. No making love there. Oh no; it was just a hard cock plowing a slut to get itself off. As I pounded her she was pushing back and moaning out a long string of "Yessss, yesss, yessss" and she must have cum two or three times before I shot my wad into her. 

 I wasn't through with her though. I pushed her over onto her back and moved up and pushed my cock at her mouth. She had never sucked me before and she held her lips hard together. I reached out and pinched her right nipple and when she yelped at the pain I pushed my cock into her open mouth. I grabbed her head and held it tight as I snarled: 

 "Suck it whore and get it hard again." 

 And she did. She had never sucked me before, but when she started it was obvious to me that she had learned to give them on some one. When she had me hard I got her back on her hands and knees and rammed her cunt again. I stroked into her long enough to get wet and then I pulled out and before she knew what was happening I rammed my cock into her ass. I expected her to scream and try to get away as I popped in, but she surprised me again. There was no scream. She grunted and then said: 

 "That's just plain nasty. You could have at least prepared me." 

 "Fuck that shit! You act like a whore I treat you like a whore" and I fucked her hard. 

 She was shoving her ass back at me and she started talking. I'd never done her anally before and I got my next surprise. 

 "Like my shitter? Like fucking my shit hole? I've had bigger than you in there. Go ahead; pond my shitter. Pack my fudge. Be the big man. Make the little girl suffer. Do I look like I'm suffering? Fuck my ass. Fuck my ass hard." 

 I pounded her as hard as I could and I gave her an orgasm. It was a first for me. I'd done anal before, but I'd never seen a girl have an orgasm from butt fucking. Thirty seconds after Connie had hers I got mine, but I wasn't done with Connie yet. 

 I don't know how I knew it, but I knew that the evening was going to be a defining moment for us. As soon as my cock blasted its load into her bowels I pulled it out of her ass and quickly, before she had a clue as to what was coming, I grabbed a handful of her hair, jerked her head around and shoved my slime covered cock in her mouth. I held her head so she couldn't get away and then I fucked her face until my cock went soft. When I was limp I let go of her head and she scrambled off the bed and ran for the bathroom. I smiled as I heard her tossing her cookies. It was a good ten minutes before she came back into the room. 

 "You bastard!!! You rotten fucking bastard!! That was filthy and fucking disgusting! What kind of man are you?" 

 "The kind of man who isn't going to put up with your shit! It was an object lesson for you. You want to act like a slut -- a stupid whore -- go do it, but when you do I'll treat you like one. Call it setting the ground rules. You are your own person and you get to make your own choices as to what you want to do. If you intend to go into this marriage intending to play around on the side whenever you feel like it so be it. It is simple enough. Keep it discrete and don't do anything that will humiliate me or disrespect me in public or in front of people we know. Act like a fiancée and a wife and be treated like a fiancée and a wife. Act like a slut and a whore and I'll treat you like a slut and a whore. 

 "And you need to understand this. When you act like a slut the people you get slutty with are going to smirk and laugh at me behind my back. I will eventually find out who they are and I will take vengeance on them and that starts now. Who are the two who fucked you tonight knowing that you are my fiancée?" 

 She looked away and then said, "I lied. There was only one and I'm not telling you who he is. All you need to know is that he and I kept company for a while after you turned your back on me. Tonight was a thanks for being there for me goodbye fuck. Now what?" 

 "What do you mean "Now what?" 

 "It was my intention to wear you out tonight, but the mood has changed." 

 "Fuck a bunch of moods! You started us out on a slut-whore night so I'll keep it going. On your hands and knees bitch." 

 She looked like she wanted to or was going to say something, but then changed her mind and assumed the position. I nailed her twice more that night before I couldn't go again. 

 I started to dress so I could take her home and she asked me what I was doing so I told her. 

 "I'm not going anywhere. We need to get used to waking up together." 

 Waking up with her was an experience in itself. I didn't think she could get twice more out of me following our night, but she managed. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 For the next three weeks she spent two or three nights a week at my place and we spent our week ends looking at houses. We found a few that I liked, but she didn't and a few that she liked and that I didn't. She was thinking big like where she had grown up and I was looking for something smaller and with in my budget. I wasn't worried much about the cost as I still had a lot of the insurance money in the bank, but the maintenance and upkeep on some of the houses Connie wanted would have wiped me out. I didn't need a four car garage, tennis courts, stables and lots of acreage. A simple three or four bedroom with an in ground pool and a hot tub was more my style.  

 

 

===

At the end of the third week came the expected invitation. We were having dinner at my place when Connie said: 

 "Mom and dad would like you to come to dinner Friday." 

 "I know what it is going to be about so I might as well head your father off at the pass." 

 "What does that mean?" 

 "It means that your mother is going to want to talk weddings and plans and your father is going to get around to talking money." 

 "So what does heading him off at the pass mean?" 

 I got up from the table, got my briefcase and took a paper out of it. I came back to the table and handed the paper to Connie. 

 "What is it?" 

 "A pre-nuptial agreement. I've all ready signed it and had it notarized. All you have to do is sign it and when your father starts to talk money all I'll have to do is hand it to him." 

 She read it, shook her head as if she didn't believe what she was reading and then looked at me and said: 

 "Are you sure?" 

 "Positive." 

 "This is going to shock my dad. After what both my sisters did he just knows that any man I marry is going to have my trust fund on his mind and will try to find someway to access it." 

 The dinner went pretty much as I had predicted except for her father being a little pissy toward her for not coming to work for him when she graduated. She explained that she wanted to make it on her own and not have it said that she advanced because of favoritism. That didn't mollify him. Her mother talked about the wedding and I could see her father waiting for his chance to jump in, but I did just what I said I wanted to do and I cut him off before he could say a word. 

 "There is something that needs to be cleared up before the wedding takes place" I said and I took the envelope out of my sports coat inside pocket. I handed it to her father as I said, "It is quite clear and to the point. In the case of a divorce for any reason whatsoever both parties leave the marriage with what they brought into it. Any acquisitions during the marriage will be split equally. Simply put, Connie's trust fund, all of it, stays with her. 

 "There is one more item to take care of and I haven't discussed it with Connie yet, but it is my intention to draw up a will that will make sure that if Connie predeceases me -- God forbid -- her funds will go to our children and not to me and further, you two will be named as joint executors of the estate." 

 The look on Barrington's face was priceless, but Connie's mother was smiling as she nodded her head as if she knew something that the rest of us didn't. While the help (yes, the Barrington's had a butler, maids and a chef) cleared the table Connie and her mother went off to look at some material that Connie's mother had found for the wedding gown and the brides maid's dresses leaving me alone with Barrington. We retired to his den and he poured me a brandy and then said: 

 "You surprised me, but then that was your intention wasn't it?" 

 "Yes and no." 

 "Yes and no?" 

 "I knew it would surprise you, but it wasn't intended. Connie has told me about her two sisters and how you view their husbands so yes, I figured that you would be surprised to find out you were not getting another one like them in the family." 

 "Yeah? Well I was right about the both of them. Houses bigger than they need, new cars, expensive toys and the trusts are being depleted. Neither one of them has a job worth spit and when the trust money is gone they won't be able to continue living high on the hog and they will start losing things. When that happens they will be coming to me for a hand out which I will probably give them. After all, they are my daughters. I have to ask. Why did you do it?" 

 "No need to lie to you at this late date. We both know I deliberately got Connie pregnant and then walked away so you would suffer the social stigma of having an unwed pregnant daughter. It wasn't much, but it was the only thing I could think of to get back at you for what I thought you did to Samantha that wouldn't have me sitting in jail. Then I found out you had nothing to do with turning Samantha into what she was. That left me with the responsibility of seeing to Connie's child. 

 "I was totally up front with Connie and I told her what I did and why and then I told her that I would marry her and give the child a name. Connie surprised the hell out of me when she said okay. I thought for sure she wouldn't want anything to do with some one who could be asshole enough to do what I'd done. I'm going into this marriage fully expecting that it will end in divorce. Connie will have the baby and then six months or so later she will ask for a divorce. The child will have avoided being born illegitimate, Connie will have avoided being an unwed mother and she will be wanting to get on with her life. 

 "I've planned ahead. I'll buy a house before we get married so it will stay with me when the divorce happens. When Connie sues for divorce I won't fight it. She will have her trust and so I won't have to pay alimony. All I'll have to pay is child support." 

 "That's a pretty cold blooded way to look at it." 

 "Think about it. If you were Connie would you want an asshole like me for a life partner?" 

 "You aren't a complete asshole. Once you had all the facts you stepped up. You could have said "Fuck it! What's done is done" and walked away." 

 "That isn't the point. What I did I did deliberately and I don't believe Connie or any other woman for that matter would want to stay with a man who could do something like that." 

 "How about we change the subject? What are your plans for the future work- wise?" 

 "I'm happy where I am. I like the work, the money and benefits are good and they seem to like me. It has been suggested that I'll be able to climb the ladder after I've been there for a while." 

 "Never given any thought to going to work for a civil engineering firm? No thought to eventually starting your own company?" 

 "Not really. My father indirectly taught me a lesson where work was concerned. He got up every morning and bitched about having to go into "That damned place" again and every night over dinner I heard about all the stupid things that management, his foreman and his lead mechanic did. I once asked him why he kept working there if he hated it so much. All he could say was that it was a steady paycheck; had good benefits and he had too much seniority to get laid off. 

 "He pretty much convinced me that what I needed in a job when I grew up was a place I enjoyed going into every day and that is what I have right now. I'm happy there and they are happy enough with me that they paid for half of my tuition and books as long as I agreed to sign a three year contract to work for them after I graduated." 

 Before the talk went any farther Connie and her mother joined us and then all the talk centered on the wedding, the honeymoon and where we were going to live. We talked about how it Connie and I couldn't seem to agree on a place and while that conversation was going on it occurred to me that I was looking at things wrong. I'd just told Barrington that I was going to buy a house before we got married so that it would stay with me after the divorce that I saw coming. I needed to be looking at houses that I wanted and would be happy with when Connie and I split up. With that thought in mind I went back over the houses that we had looked at and two of them stood out. I decided to take a closer look at both of them. 

 When it was time to leave Connie's mother (please call me Maggi) cornered me and reminded me that she wanted me to call her and set up a lunch date or come see her so we could talk privately and I told her that I would. 

 As I was driving Connie back to her place she asked, "What's with this predeceased bullshit?" 

 "It isn't bullshit and it could happen. Just because you are young and healthy doesn't mean you are immortal. Look at Samantha. Young, vibrant, full of life and dead at twenty-three. The will takes care of the child and that is what this is all about." She sat silent for a few miles and then said: 

 "I don't want to go to my place." 

 Accordingly I steered the car toward my apartment and what followed was another exhausting night. 

 To be continued...  

 

 

===

Over the next two days I revisited the houses I was interested in and finally decided on a three bedroom ranch with an attached three car garage, an in- ground swimming pool and a hot tub. I put a hundred-fifty thousand down on it which just about knocked the socks off of the real estate agent. I had already arranged for the bank where I had my accounts to finance the house I picked and I figured that we would close in thirty days or so. 

 Samantha's mother told me that she didn't want any of Samantha's stuff so I went to the storage unit and dug through everything there to sort it out for Goodwill and a couple of other charitable organizations and in the course of digging I found out another lie that Samantha had told me. She said Barrington was going to give her twenty-five thousand for what she had been doing. I found two bank books with over eighty grand between them. Samantha told me she was trying to get the twenty five thousand so we could put a down payment on a house. If she was looking down or up from wherever she was she couldn't miss the smile on my face. She had just paid off my new house. I'd move into it free and clear. 

 I decided to get my meeting with Connie's mother out of the way. I called and we made a lunch date for one the next day. We met at the Hilton and Maggie was all ready there when I got there and she stood up, smiled and offered me her hand. I took it and then surprised her by kissing it in the continental fashion and then we sat down. 

 It is said that if you want to know what you wife is going to look like twenty years down the road look at her mother. Maggie was a fox! She was a forty-four year old woman who looked all of thirty and a quick glance around the restaurant showed that almost all of the males there were looking at her. A waitress appeared, took my drink order and then left. 

 "I'll just bet that curiosity is driving you nuts right? What on earth could Connie's mother want to talk to me about and in private, right again?" 

 "That's pretty much it." 

 "Well it is the last thing in the world that you would expect. Are you sure that you want to marry my daughter?" 

 That caught me flat footed and I said, "What?" 

 "A simple question that only requires a simple answer. Are you sure that you want to marry Connie?" 

 "It isn't a question of want. It is something that I have to do to make things right. Why would you ask such a question?" 

 "Because you are a very nice guy and I don't think that you know what you are getting yourself into. And don't pooh pooh the nice guy thing. I know why you did what you did and yes, it wasn't a nice thing to do, but once you found out the circumstances you manned up. That makes you special in my book. Robert of course put you down as another fortune hunter try to sieze the opportunity to get your hands on Connie's trust fund, but you very effectively shot him down on that subject. One more reason to see you as a good man." 

 The waitress showed up with our drinks and took our luncheon order and when she was gone Maggie said: 

 "I had to ask myself if I wanted to see a man with your good qualities saddle himself with Connie and the answer I came up with was that it wasn't any of my business, but I talked myself into at least giving you fair warning." 

 "I don't understand? What is wrong with Connie?" 

 "To put it frankly she is a slut." 

 "She told me about that. She said she did it to get back at me for dumping her. I was supposed to see it and. get pissed. The only problem with that is when I walked away I didn't look back so I never knew what she was doing." 

 "And you believed that?" 

 "Why not? She wasn't like that when I met her and she wasn't like that while we were together." 

 "That was then. It is now that counts." 

 "Now?" 

 "Are you aware that at your first public appearance with her after putting a ring on her finger and her telling all the people that she talked to at the event that she was engaged to you that she snuck off with Mike Bolla, Billy Sheppard and Jamie Ogden and screwed them in the coat room?" 

 I was of course aware that she had screwed someone, but she told me that it was only one. 

 "No, I wasn't aware of that" I said. 

 "And I'll bet that you aren't aware that even as we sit here and talk she is upstairs in room 407 with Mike Bolla and Jamie Ogden." 

 "I had no idea." 

 "I picked this restaurant and one o'clock for a reason. I also got here early enough to get this specific table. You will notice that you can see the elevators from here. If they stick to their normal schedule -- they take long lunches from work -- they will be coming down within the next ten to fifteen minutes. I figured that the best way to handle things would be to let you see for yourself." 

 Our meal came and as we ate and made small talk I kept one eye on the elevators and at one-twenty the doors opened and Connie and two guys came out. I recognized both of them from the charity event I had attended with Connie. I looked over at Maggie. 

 "It changes nothing. I still need to make my child legitimate and then a reasonable time after the child's birth a quiet divorce can be arranged." 

 "That is not the reaction that I expected." 

 "No? What did you expect?" 

 "Anger, rage or something like that. In fact that is what I was hoping for and not the calm acceptance that I'm seeing." 

 "Why were you hoping for anger and rage?" 

 "Because those emotions might have led you to go along with what I wanted to do." 

 "And that would be?" 

 "Go upstairs and do the same thing that your intended was doing." 

 "Why on earth would you want to do that?" 

 "Revenge." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "It is simple really. I am a healthy woman and I enjoy sex. I will not allow my husband to have sex with me so I take care of my sexual appetites by entering into affairs with the husbands, fiancées and boyfriends of the women my husband has sex with. That is my revenge." 

 "And he doesn't care?" 

 "He doesn't know. He thinks I lost all interest in sex after the last time he gave me gonorrhea." 

 "Connie told me that you and Robert hadn't had sex in over ten years. I didn't believe her." 

 "It is true. Robert gave me sexually transmitted diseases four times over a six year period and after the last time I refused to let him touch me any more. I told him that the last disease he gave me made me lose all interest in sex." 

 Why then do you stay married to him?" 

 "Money for the most part. Barrington Industries used to be Barrington Manufacturing. My family owned Stowe Industrial and my parents and Robert's parents wanted to see us married and the two businesses merged. It didn't hurt that I loved Robert and I thought he loved me. It was a convoluted deal that saw that when the two companies merged the new company was named Barrington Industries in exchange for my family receiving fifty-one percent of the stock. 

 "I'm an only child and when my parents died I inherited their stock. With the prenuptial agreements that are in place if Robert and I divorce for any reason whatsoever the company would end up being broken up, Financially I wouldn't be hurt, but a lot of good people would be put out of work. I couldn't let that happen just because Robert couldn't keep his dick in his pants. Besides, having affairs with different men is exciting and I get to experience a lot. Kind of a sexual smorgasbord." 

 "Why not just one full time lover? God knows you are beautiful and sexy enough to land any man you want." 

 "Yes, but where would be the revenge in that?" 

 "So this lunch was all about landing me to satisfy your need for revenge?" 

 "That and I really did think you needed to know what you are getting yourself into. As I said earlier; I liked the way you stepped up when you could have walked away." 

 "So it is about you getting revenge on your husband and not because you have something against your daughter." 

 "I am upset that my baby has turned into what she is, but no, I have nothing against her. She was just my way to try and hook you." 

 "Why have you been keeping an eye on her to begin with?" 

 "When she told me she was pregnant I put a private detective on her. I wanted to know what kind of man she was going to end up dragging home. I was afraid it would be another loser like both of my other daughters ended up with. Someone I'd have to find someway to break her away from. I was surprised that it was you. I've had private investigators on Robert since I cut him off so I would know who the men were that I needed to seduce for my revenge. I knew about your wife and Robert and the investigators found out quite a bit about you. I was already planning your seduction when your wife was killed and I dropped my plans." 

 "Why?" 

 "Two reasons. One, it would have been crass to try to move in on a recent widower and two; the fun part of the revenge is doing the man while my husband was doing the woman. When I found out that you were the one who got Connie pregnant and then found out what she was doing I decided to take a shot at you and so here we are." 

 "Indeed we are and I guess I need to see about finding us a bed unless of course you want to do it right here on the table." 

 "That easy? I thought for sure I would have to work harder." 

 "I see no reason to remain true to Connie if she isn't going to be true to me and then of course there is fact that I also owe your husband a little revenge. What better revenge than to do to his wife what he did to mine." 

 I got up and said, "I'll get us a room." 

 Once in the room we undressed and I told her to leave her high heels on. "Nothing sexier than a naked woman in high heels." 

 "My kind of guy. We are going to have so much fun together." 

 I went down on her and then fucked her. She sucked me hard and I fucked her a second time. When I finished she asked: 

 "Are you kinky enough to eat me with your cum in me?" 

 I smiled at her and said, "Spread 'em sweetie." 

 "Oh no lover; I'm thinking of one of my favorite numbers, sixty-nine." 

 When she had me tall again she asked me how many times I was good for and I said: 

 "With you for inspiration? Only God knows." 

 "I didn't realize you were a silver tongued devil. I may just have to keep you." 

 "I like the sound of that." 

 "How do you feel about anal?" 

 "I like everything when it comes to sex, but I don't often do anal because a lot of the ladies I've known didn't like it and wouldn't do it." 

 "I used to be that way. I would never let Robert do it, but once I hit the revenge trail I decided to do it. I needed to give my lovers something that Robert never got. After a bit I learned to like it." 

 "This your way of telling me what you want to do next?" 

 "Clever boy" she said as she got on her hands and knees and presented her heart shaped ass to me. 

 As we were dressing she said, "I do hope that this is not a one time thing." 

 "That will depend on how often you can get free to do it and on when you can do it. I can't always get free from work like I did this afternoon and I'm assuming that Connie is going to be keeping my evenings full." 

 "Long lunch hours? Working late a time or two each week? Get her in the mind set that it is part of the job? Plus I can always give her a task or two to take care of as far as the wedding is concerned that will get her out of the way for a while." 

 "How long do you usually hang on to your revenge lovers?" 

 "Until they get tired of me." 

 "I can't see any one ever getting tired of you." 

 "They usually want more than I can give so they fade away." 

 "What you are saying is that it is pretty much up to me." 

 "Pretty much." 

 "And if I never get tired of it? How will you handle your need to get revenge with the men of the women that Robert scores with if I never get tired of you?" 

 "As long as I'm with you I'll still be playing with a man whose wife Robert had sex with." 

 We exchanged a passionate kiss and then left the room. 

 +++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next two weeks were busy ones. Connie was tied up getting everything done that needed to be done to make the wedding come off the way she wanted. I was able to get together with Maggie two or three times a week and she kept me up to date on what her investigators were reporting about Connie's activities. 

 Connie met with Bolla twice, once each with Sheppard and Ogden and twice with all three. The second time she met with all three was four days before the wedding and according to Connie what she had going that night was a bachelorette party given by the girls she worked with. A day later she thought that I was at a bachelor party thrown by the guys I worked with. She was half right. It was my bachelor party, but there were only two people there -- Maggie and me. 

 The wedding went off without a hitch and Connie and I left the reception, drove to the airport and headed off on our honeymoon. We got to our hotel in Aruba, checked in and unpacked. Connie put on something filmy and see through, struck a pose and said: 

 "Ready to consummate our union sailor?" 

 She was shocked and stunned when I said: 

 "Not tonight. We won't be able to consummate the marriage until I see something in writing from a doctor or laboratory stating that you are disease free. I have no idea who Sheppard, Ogden and Bolla have been fucking besides you and I'm not going to take a chance on catching anything they, or who ever else you have been fucking, might have given you. See the hotel doctor. Maybe he can clear you quick enough that we might be able to consummate before we have to head home. I'm going down to the bar and have a drink or two. You can join me if you wish." 

 I left the room and left her standing there opened mouthed in shock. She surprised me. I didn't think she would come down, but twenty minutes after I got there she slid onto the barstool next to me. The bar maid took her order and when she left us to go mix it Connie said: 

 "Why are we even here? Why did you waste the money on this trip if you never intended to do anything?" 

 "We are here for the same reason we got married. For appearances sake." 

 "You aren't making sense. You have been making love to me all along. What is different now that we are here?" 

 "I didn't know about your three bed buddies until the night of your so called bachelorette party. You have noticed that we haven't had sex since that night haven't you?" 

 "I thought that you were saving it up for a memorable wedding night." 

 "Well I guess, depending on your take, tonight will be memorable in a way." 

 "I don't understand what is going on here. You made it plain to me that you are only marrying me to give the baby legitimacy. What do you care what I do if you planned on leaving me after the baby was born anyway?" 

 "I never said that. What I said was that the decision on how the marriage was going to go and how long it would last would be up to you. I had no intention of ever going for a divorce. I told you up front that any decision to divorce would be on you. I also told you that if you were going to play around on me that you needed to be discrete. I told you I would not stand for people smirking at me and laughing at the poor, dumb cuckold. I also told you I would take vengeance on any one who exposed me to public or private ridicule. 

 "You were seen going into a hotel room with a man who wasn't me by some one who knows me so I put a private investigator on you and that's how I found out about your three lovers. I took care of Sheppard the day before the wedding and I'll take care of the other two when we get back home." 

 "What did you do to Billy?" 

 "I beat him so bad he had to go to the hospital emergency room." 

 "That wasn't fair! I told him you were okay with it. I told all three of them you were okay with it. You told me that it was my body and I got to make the choices as to what to do with it." 

 "I did, but I also told you to be discrete and not cause me any public humiliation. You could have gone into that hotel room and the guy could have followed you in ten minutes later or he could have gone in first and you could have joined him later, but that isn't what you did. You walked into that room hand in hand and you were seen doing it so now there are at least two people out there who know my wife is a cheating slut and that she has cuckolded me. I told you I wouldn't stand for it and I won't." 

 "So I'm in for a sexless honeymoon." 

 "Unless you show me that the guys you have been fucking haven't given you a disease." 

 "Why does that matter to you now? We have been making love for three months now and I have been seeing those guys for the entire time you and I have been together so if they did give me something I've already shared it with you." 

 "Maybe, but then again maybe not. Anyone of those three could have fucked some girl a week ago and picked up something that they gave you at your party. I had myself tested on Saturday and I'll call them Tuesday for the results. If I'm infected I had to have gotten it from you so if I'm already infected you are too and we can have sex after the phone call. If I'm not infected we don't have sex until you are cleared. If you aren't cleared we won't have sex until you can bring me proof that whatever you have is cured. 

 "We can still have a honeymoon. We can enjoy the beach, the nightlife, the sightseeing and whatever else the place has to offer." 

 "That's not good enough for me. I'll call home tomorrow and call the family lawyer. The moment I said "I do" I came into my trust fund. I'll have money transferred into my checking account so I can buy a ticket and fly home." 

 "No need for that. Just use the return portion of the ticket that got you here." 

 "I forgot about that." 

 She got up and walked away without touching her drink. I nursed my drink and watched one of the several TVs that were in the bar while I made plans on what to do the next day. I thought scuba diving would be a good way to start what was obviously going to be a two week vacation for me instead of a two week honeymoon for us. 

 Connie was back in thirty minutes or so. "I'm listed on the first flight out in the morning. It leaves at ten-ten. That gives you plenty of time to change your mind about consummation." 

 "No problem. If you can get tested and cleared by then we will be good to go." 

 "Okay then. I'll use the time until you get back to look for a suitable house." 

 "Don't waste your time. I've already found the one I want and I've put up the down payment. Should close in thirty days or so." 

 "What if I don't like it?" 

 "You probably won't. It is one of the ones that we looked at and that you decided against." 

 "How could you do that without talking to me?" 

 "Easy. Once I found out about your three playmates it was obvious to me that we are going to end up in a divorce so if I'm going to get stuck with a house it ought to be one that I want. What you can do when you get back is warn Bolla and Ogden I'll be coming after them when I get home. It will give them time to run and hide and I'll have to hunt them down. I like to hunt. You didn't know that about me did you? The thrill of the chase as I track them down one by one." 

 "No way I can talk you out of it?" 

 "You care that much about them?" 

 "Not really, but I feel responsible. I led them on and when they were reluctant I told them that you and I had an arrangement and that you were okay with me playing." 

 "I'll think about it. No promises, but I will think about it." 

 She got up and left and she wasn't in the room when I got there. I took a shower and went to bed. I slept soundly and didn't wake up when Connie came in, but she was in bed next to me when I woke up. She didn't wake up when I got up or while I was dressing. I left her ticket on the bedside stand and went down to have breakfast. 

 After breakfast I headed for the beach and the dive shop that the girl behind the reception desk told me about. It was close to two o'clock when I got back to the room and surprise, surprise, Connie was in the room.  

 

 

===

"I thought you were gone." 

 "Changed my mind. I saw a doctor this morning and for a thousand dollars he promised me an expedited test. He said I should hear late Wednesday or early Thursday." 

 "Why did you change your mind?" 

 "I don't want a divorce. I only messed around with those guys because I was pissed at you for what you did to me. It wasn't even me you were pissed at. All I ever did to you was fall in love with you and then you deliberately knock me up and then take off on me. I owed you! It wasn't fucking those three that was important to me it was fucking you after fucking them. Fucking you while I still had a little of them still inside me. I felt that I owed you that. I had no intention of keeping on with them after the wedding. I fully intend to honor the vows I made." 

 I looked at her for a few moments and then asked, "What do you want to do this afternoon?" 

 Tuesday I called home and found out I had tested clean. Thursday morning Connie found out that she was clean and we spent Thursday afternoon and evening consummating our union. The rest of our time there was as good of a honeymoon as you could have hoped for. 

 The day we flew home I called Maggie and told her that I couldn't see her again, at least not intimately, and then I told her why. 

 "If Connie really means what she said and stays faithful I will too, but if she doesn't and you haven't already taken up with some other guy for revenge I will definitely give you a call." 

 "I always knew you were a good guy. I'll tell you this. If my daughter does back slide and you call and I am with some one I'll drop him in a heartbeat and we can get back to having fun again." 

 "Thanks love; I needed that." 

 "Needed what?" 

 "To know that some one really cares for me." 

 "You don't think Constance does?" 

 "I don't know love. I can only hope and then wait and see." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Three weeks after we got home Connie told me over dinner that she'd had lunch that day with Sheppard. 

 "He wanted to know when we were going to get together again. I told him never. I told him I was a married woman now and that I was going to honor my vows. He didn't take it well. He said I owed him for the beating you gave him." 

 "Why are you telling me this?" 

 "Because some one might have seen us and told you about it and I do not want it to look like I'm hiding anything from you. I will be occasionally seen with Billy, Mike and Jamie because I do work with them and I do end up having working lunches with them and others from time to time. Also I will sometimes stop after work for drinks with the people from the office and they will probably be there. I know how fragile our relationship is because of what I did before the wedding so I have to be completely open with you if I don't want things to go to hell." 

 "I can't ask for anything more than that." 

 The next day around noon I got a call from Maggie on my cell. After exchanging greetings she said: 

 "Constance had lunch with one of her old lovers yesterday." 

 "You still having her watched?" 

 "I paid for six months surveillance and it still has two months to go. When they aren't watching Robert they watch Constance and since Robert is out of town this week they are on my daughter. Anyway, the guy watching got the booth next to them and overheard most of the conversation. Constance shut him down and told him no way ever again. I thought you might like to know." 

 "Thanks. It is good to hear." 

 "Not to me sweetie. I was hoping that she would take up with him again." 

 "Whatever for?" 

 "So we would have a reason to make sweet music again." 

 "I can't believe that you would want to waste your time on me." 

 "I've got news for you lover. If I could have found some way to bump off Robert and get away with it you would not have become Constance's husband. You would have been her new step-father." 

 "Oh wow!" 

 "Yeah lover; and don't you ever forget it. Take care of my baby. Bye." 

 As I hung up the phone I began to think that Connie and I just might make it. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The ultrasound showed that it was a boy and we started talking about names. Connie asked if I would mind if we named him after her father and when I asked why she said: 

 "He was the one who got us together." 

 I didn't care so the name she came up was a mouthful. Robert Conner Ellsworth Smythe-Barrington Walton. I had my doubts about giving the kid that name. I could just imagine the fights he was going to get into when the other kids started making fun of his name until I realized that it would rarely get used. When he started school he would register as Robert Walton and use one of the other names as his middle initial. And knowing kids since my name was Robert Walton he would probably get hung with the tag of 'Junior' and end up being called JR. 

 Robert C.E.S-B.Walton came into the world at a health eight pounds and nine ounces and immediately became the apple of his grand parent's eyes. Connie's sisters all had girls so Robby was the only male grandchild and he was doted on and I could see the poor kid being spoiled rotten. 

 Connie took a nine month maternity leave and then she went back to work. They had a day care center in the building so Robby went to work with her. A couple of times she called me and asked me to come by and pick Robby up so she could stop for drinks with the people from the office. And she always filled me in on what happened. Sheppard kept trying to get her to give in and once she had to throw a drink in his face to get him to back off. When the others from her office saw that they started to police things as far as Sheppard was concerned. 

 

 Things were going good for us and then came Connie's company Christmas party. We hadn't gone to the last one because it had taken place during her maternity leave. I wasn't looking forward to it because it was bound to be an awkward time for me. All three of Connie's ex-bed buddies were going to be there including Sheppard whose ass I had stomped so bad that he'd had to go to the hospital. 

 Connie didn't share my concerns. 

 "It is a big ballroom and we will sit as far away from them as possible. I admit that I expect them to try and tweak your nose a bit if they can by asking me to dance, but I will always ask you if you would mind when they do. Feel free to say no. I want to enjoy myself, but I do not, under any circumstances, want to do anything that will bother you or hurt us. I will be expected to dance with my bosses and it would be nice if you were to dance with their wives, but you don't have to if you don't want to." 

 "I'll behave. I'll do my best to be charming." 

 "Don't be too charming. Andy's wife is a stunner and I don't want her thinking of taking you for a test drive." 

 "She play around?" 

 "Not that I know of, but she hasn't met you yet." 

 It went pretty much as I expected. There was a cocktail hour followed by dinner which was followed by speeches and then the live band took over. I was introduced to a bunch of people whose names I promptly forgot. I met her boss Andy and his wife Jessica and she was indeed a stunner. If I had been in a girl chasing mood she would have been the one I would want to chase. 

 Sheppard, Ogden and Bolla sat together with their dates (and in Bolla's case his wife) on the other side of the ballroom from us. I did notice them looking our way from time to time and I would have to say that the looks were nasty and I wondered if the women at the table had a clue as to what was going on. 

 The dancing started and I danced the first three numbers with Connie and then Sam, her office manager, asked her to dance so I asked his wife Sarah. Then another guy she worked with asked her and she looked over at me and I nodded a yes. When she got back to the table we had another drink. I'd been drinking vodka tonics with a slice of lime and after two I'd slipped the waitress a twenty and told her to make sure all my future drinks were a glass of water and a slice of lime. I was in dangerous territory and I knew it and I wanted to keep my wits about me. I knew Sheppard had to be seething over the beating I'd given him and I expected that he would enlist Ogden and Bolla to help him get back at me (I'd bowed to Connie's entreaties to leave Ogden and Bolla alone). Whether or not they would try something at the party I didn't know, but I needed to be ready just in case. 

 I expected either Bolla or Ogden to ask Connie for a dance so it was a surprise when it was Sheppard who showed up at our table and asked Connie for a dance. He had bigger stones than I had given him credit for. Connie looked at me and I think I shocked her when I nodded yes. As Connie and Sheppard moved out onto the floor I noticed that Andy's wife Jessica sitting alone so I went over and asked her to dance. As she moved into my arms she said: 

 "You are a bit of a surprise." 

 "Oh?" 

 "I wouldn't have pictured you as a wimp." 

 "You say that as if you do picture me as one now. Care to enlighten me as to why?" 

 "The rather docile way you let her dance with one of her lovers." 

 "One of her ex-lovers. What she did prior to saying "I do" is not something I let bother me any more than I would expect my dalliances before we were married to bother her." 

 "Are you all that sure that he is an ex? My experience is that a girl who has done two or three at a time rarely gives them up." 

 "She knows that I know about them and she knows what will happen if they stop being exes. Might I ask why the interest?" 

 "Andy has the hots for Connie and he has been working on her. Without any luck I will add." 

 "You know this and it doesn't bother you?" 

 "We have an open marriage honey and we have been known to swing with certain select couples. I'm kind of hoping that Andy scores with her because then I might get a taste of you." 

 The music stopped and I started to walk her back to her table, but she stopped me. 

 "One more please?" 

 The music started up again and as Jessica moved into my arms I saw Connie move out onto the floor with Andy. I smiled as I said: 

 "Keeping me away from Connie to give your hubby a chance to try and work his magic?" 

 "Am I that transparent?" 

 "You must love him a lot to let him run free like that." 

 "Oh I do sugar, but I do have an ulterior motive." 

 "Oh?" 

 "He gets her I've got a shot at you." 

 "That's honest enough so I'll be straight with you. If Andy succeeds our marriage is over and I will consider that I have been released from my vows. At that point I'll be more than happy to give you your shot. That of course assumes you will still want a taste if I'm not part of a couple." 

 "I said we had an open marriage and that means I free to do what I want as long as I don't hide it from him and I always go home to him so yes, if you ever consider yourself released from your vows make sure that you give me a shout." 

 The tune ended and I escorted Jessica back to her table and then returned to mine. Connie was seated when I got there and the next tune started and I offered her my hand and we moved out onto the floor. 

 "Enjoying yourself?" I asked. 

 "Yes I am. How about you?" 

 "It has been an interesting evening for me." 

 "So has Jessica captured you yet?" 

 "Why would you ask that?" 

 "She is the only one here besides myself that you went out onto the floor with and stayed out there for two straight dances." 

 "She is an interesting lady and we had a very interesting conversation." 

 "About what?" 

 "About you for the most part." 

 "Me? Why would she talk about me?" 

 "I'll let you think about it for a bit. Maybe I'll tell you when we leave." 

 "That's no fair." 

 "Depends on the way you look at it. Am I asking you what you talked about with your dance partners?" 

 "No, but I'll tell you if you want to know." 

 "Well I don't. I am of course curious, but I'm not that nosy." 

 "There is something not being said here." 

 "You are right about that." 

 She cocked her head and gave me a look when I said that, but I just smiled and kept on dancing. When we got back to the table and sat down I noticed that Connie's drink was empty so I went and got her another one. When I got back to the table Bolla was there and he looked at me and asked: 

 "Mind if I have a dance with Connie?" 

 "Not all at" I said which surprised Connie and as they moved out onto the floor I decided that it would be a good time to go to the men's room. 

 As I was shaking off the last few drops Sheppard and Ogden came into the bathroom. I zipped up and turned toward them and Sheppard smirked and said: 

 "Its payback time mother fucker." 

 I put my hand in my pocket and said, "You really don't want to do this." 

 "Oh yes I do" he said as he moved toward me. I took my hand out of my pocket and gave him a shot of pepper spray in his eyes. As his hands went up to his face I kicked him square in the nuts and he screamed, clutched at his groin and fell to the floor. I turned to Ogden and made a big production out of putting the pepper spray away and then I smiled at him and said: 

 "I really like a good one on one fight don't you?" 

 I started toward him and he ran from the room. I stepped over the moaning Sheppard, washed and dried my hands and then went back to the party. I headed for the table where Sheppard, Ogden and Bolla had been sitting and saw Ogden's face lose color as I approached. Everyone else at the table, with the exception of Bolla's wife, looked a little nervous as I approached and I guessed they all knew what was suppose to happen in the bathroom. I stopped at the table and addressed Bolla's wife. 

 "I know we've never met, but since your husband is dancing with my wife I thought it only fair that I ask you to dance." 

 She looked me in the eye, smiled and said, "I'd love to." 

 She moved into my arms, told me that her name was Gwen and then said: 

 "You are a bold one aren't you." 

 "Why would you say that?" 

 "The way you walked up to the table after what was supposed to happen in the men's room. Poor Jamie was white as a sheet when he came back to the table and it was of course noted that Billy wasn't with him. Then here you come unruffled and smiling." 

 "Sorry to ruin everyone's evening." 

 "Not every one's. Certainly not mine. I can't stand Billy and I can barely tolerate Jamie, but they are Mike's friends so I have to grin and bear it." 

 "I was surprised that Mike didn't come in with them." 

 "Mike told them not to do it and told them he'd be no part of it. So why did you ask me to dance? Going to ask for quid pro quo?" 

 "What?" 

 "You know; he had yours so you have his?" 

 "It is tempting because you are one fine and sexy looking lady, but I am one of those weird ones. I made some promises when I said my 'I Do's and I keep my promises." 

 "She the same?" 

 "Only time will tell. Obviously you know. You have one of those open marriage things?" 

 "No. I caught him and made him an offer he couldn't refuse." 

 "Oh?" 

 "He is a marvelous father and dotes on his kids. I told him that if it ever happened again I'd leave him and take his kids so far away that he would never see them again." 

 "Effective. Very effective." 

 The music stopped and she said, "Don't take me back just yet." The next tune started and as we moved to the music she said: 

 "There's more. I told him that there was a price to pay for my forgiveness. I told him that he owed me one and that some day I was going to come home freshly fucked and he wasn't to say one word about it or the kids and I would disappear." 

 "Did you mean it or was it just a way to make him sweat?" 

 "Oh I meant it alright and when you asked me to dance I was hoping that it would be tonight." 

 "Sorry to disappoint." 

 "Keep me in mind if things don't work out with your wife. I'll hang onto my get out of jail free card for a while just in case." 

 As we walked to the car Connie said, "I guess it wasn't as bad as you expected. You seemed to have enjoyed yourself." 

 "I had a good time, Hell, anytime two good looking ladies offer to play with me is a good time." 

 "Who!! I'll scratch their fucking eyes out!" 

 "Bolla's wife for one. She knows about you and her hubby and she offered me a little payback if I wanted to even the score." 

 "How could she know? We were very careful to hide things from her." 

 "Not careful enough it appears." 

 "You going to do it?" 

 "That depends on you." 

 "Me? Why does it depend on me?" 

 "Simple. You honor your vows and I'll keep mine. You don't and that releases me from mine." 

 "I told you that I did all my playing before the wedding and that I had no intention of ever doing it again after the wedding." 

 "I know that is what you said, but can you do it? A rather experienced woman told me tonight that after a woman experiences threesomes and foursomes and has liked them she will always want to do them again and again and again." 

 "Who told you that?" 

 "Andy's wife Jessica." 

 "How in the world did you ever get in a conversation like that with her?" 

 "When she asked me how I felt about my wife dancing with her lover in front of me I said ex-lover and that is what got the conversation going. I had it right didn't I? Sheppard is an ex-lover right?" 

 "Of course he is." She paused for a second or two and then said, "He doesn't want to be. He spent the entire time we were dancing trying to talk me into seeing him again. I left him in no doubt that it was never going to happen. Jessica knew? I wonder how?" 

 "Guys talk and Andy works with your three ex studs. I'm sure that he found out from one or all of them." 

 "But why would he tell Jessica?" 

 "They don't keep secrets from each other. According to her they have an open marriage and each of them is free to go out and play as long as they don't hide it from each other and they always come home to each other. Andy told Jessica that he was going after you and she told me that she hoped he was successful." 

 "Why would she tell you that?" 

 "She thinks if he gets you she can get me." 

 "That bitch!!! She better stay away from you or I'll hurt her! I'll hurt her bad!!" She paused and then said, "Could she get you?" 

 "Only if Andy was to score with you." 

 "No way! And for a bunch of reasons." 

 "A bunch?" 

 "First is the fact that I'll die before I break my vows. Second there is the fact that I want to climb the ladder in the company and if I slept with Andy it would be assumed that I'm trying to sleep my way to the top. The opposite side of that coin, given the current atmosphere concerning sexual discrimination and sexual harassment, is that if I fucked Andy and got promoted some one who felt the promotion should have been theirs could file a complaint. Last and by no means least, I don't much like Andy. Of course that opinion was formed by the way he was always sniffing after everything in a skirt when he had something like Jessica at home. Doesn't change anything now that I know Jessica doesn't care. He still seems 'smarmy' to me." 

 She paused and then said, "Does that bother you?" 

 "Why would it bother me?" 

 "Maybe you were hoping I'd give you a chance to try out that sex bomb." 

 "I won't deny that she turns me on and for that matter so did Bolla's wife, but when it comes to sex bombs I already have one and she's enough for me as long as she stays my sex bomb and mine alone." 

 "Then you are never going to get to try on either one of them. I admit that I was a little loose before the wedding, but I felt that I owed you that for what you originally intended to do to me." 

 There was another pause and then she said, "I will tell you this. Jessica was right. Once you do threesomes and foursomes and like them you are always going to want to do them again. I do want to do them again, but the only way I ever will is if you are one of the men." 

 "Then you are shit out of luck my little sex bomb, because I am just not wound that way."

"You do of course realize that all this talk about sex has gotten me horny and you have your work cut out for you as soon as we get home." 

 "I can live with that." 

 And they lived happily ever after.
