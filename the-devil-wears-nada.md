 * 

 Abby had always wanted to write the next great article. When she was in school for journalism she dreamed of being the person to break a huge news story. She studied the Watergate scandal like crazy, and hoped to someday do what those reporters did. That was her dream and she thought that nothing would stand in her way. 

 But something did stand in her way, namely the economy. As she graduated from school, the job market went into the tank. Newspapers were dying off left and right, and Abby was finding it difficult to break in to the business. After months of phone calls and applications, Abby realized getting into newspapers was a no go. She then started to explore jobs at different magazines. This yielded more success for Abby. That was how she ended up in New York City, in the offices of "Style" magazine. 

 This amused Abby because, quite frankly, she didn't know a thing about fashion, nor did she really care. She thought the girls that cared about clothes were shallow airheads. But since she needed a job, she would take anything. The only two magazines she had heard back from were "Style" and some car magazine. 

 Abby waited patiently for the interview. She had arrived on time, but the woman who was interviewing her was running late. She was wearing a blue sweater and a knit-dress, trying to look nice for her interview. She was interviewing to be the junior personal assistant to the editor-in-chief of the magazine. And from what she had heard, it was a pretty prestigious position. Abby looked up as a young woman entered the room she was waiting in and set her stuff down on one of the two desks in the room. Abby knew this wasn't the woman she was interviewing with. She was too young. It took a few minutes before the woman realized that Abby was in the room. 

 "Who are you?" she asked with a British accent as she took her seat. 

 "I'm Abby Cline. I'm interviewing for the junior personal assistant position. I'm supposed to meet with Nina Baxter." Abby said. 

 "Not in that outfit, I hope." the woman said, smirking as she looked at Abby's outfit. 

 "What's wrong with it?" Abby asked, confused, as she looked down at herself. The woman didn't have time to answer as a flurry of activity entered the room. All Abby saw were two men talking to a woman as she walked into the main office Abby was waiting outside of. The woman appeared to throw her coat onto the desk of the girl Abby had been talking to. Abby looked over to the girl, and the girl gestured her heard towards the office, indicating that Abby should go in. Abby quickly gathered her things and cautiously walked into the office. The woman, Audrey, smiled as watched this lamb get led to her slaughter. She had no idea what she was getting into. The woman who was supposed to interview her was like no one she had met before. There was no chance a girl like her was ready to deal with Nina Baxter. 

 Nina Baxter was a cunt. And that was what her friends would call her. Not to imply that she had friends. The people that were close to her were close because they were useful to her in some way. But it was doubtful she cared about any of them. She had risen to power within this magazine what felt like ages ago, and she had run it like a tyrant. This should have driven every one of her workers away, but it didn't for one simple reason: she was good at her job. She had an eye for fashion that was second to none. Nina Baxter had dictated what was fashionable and what wasn't for almost twenty years. Fashion designers were clamoring to be featured in her magazine. She was a harsh woman, and was too tough for most to handle. She was dismissive to her underlings and was cold even to the people that had worked for her for years. It was a thankless job, but for most, it was a springboard into the world of fashion. Anybody who was anybody in the fashion business had at some point passed through the doors of "Style" magazine. Surviving working under Nina Baxter was a badge of honor. 

 Audrey had been working under Nina for about two years. It was a 24/7 job. She had to be ready to do whatever Nina asked, no matter what time it was. She had been hoping that Nina would hire someone else to help share the load. But looking at this girl, Abby, Audrey just knew Nina would eat her alive. She watched intently as Abby walked into the office. 

 Abby looked on as a rapid conversation took place between this woman who had just sat at her desk and the two men talking to her. They were talking quickly about fashion things that Abby didn't understand. Abby didn't realize how many girls would kill to be in the presence of a fashion icon like Nina Baxter. After about two minutes, the woman looked up and noticed Abby. 

 "Audrey." she said calmly but firmly. Abby watched as the girl she talked to earlier entered the room. 

 "Yes?" Audrey said. 

 "Who is this?" Nina asked. 

 "This is Abby Cline. She is interviewing for your Junior Personal Assistant position." Audrey said. With that, Nina stood up. 

 For the first time, Abby was able to take her in. For a woman who was clearly older, she still looked great. She was wearing a smart looking business suit, with a white blouse under it. The suit could not hide her great body. The first thing Abby noticed about Nina were her incredibly large breasts. Abby had to admit that those suckers were huge. They were much bigger than Abby's B-cups. Abby guessed they were on the larger end of an EE-cup, possibly bigger. Nina had a few buttons on her blouse opened, exposing a hint of cleavage. Her skin was pale, but a creamy pale as opposed to a sickly pale. Nina had a firm, fit body. For a woman in the fashion industry, she had to look her best at all times. As Nina turned, Abby noticed Nina's butt. It held up its end of the bargain, looking nice and round, with her pants molding around it. Abby had to admit she was a little jealous of this older woman's body. Abby looked at her face. Abby didn't know it, but Nina's true age was a closely guarded mystery. Nobody knew her true age, simply because it was not in her best interest to have everyone know. There were a few things though that illustrated her true age group. She had a shock of silvery gray hair, cut shortly but fashionably, looking extremely stylish. She had some crow's feet near her eyes. Abby noticed that she didn't have any laugh lines. Abby realized that this was a woman who did not smile much. Her facial features were sharp. She had penetrating eyes, which displayed her intelligence. Her lips were full and perpetually forming a pout. Her face shared her body's creamy pale coloring. But for her, pale worked. 

 Abby stood still as she let Nina take her in. Nina looked her up and down, before giving her a trace of a smile. 

 "What do you think, Piers?" Nina asked, with her breathy voice. An older man with a shaved head walked towards her. He looked her up and down as well. 

 "Well, this sweater is not flattering at all. That dress looks like it was knit by my grandmother. She clearly doesn't understand much about fashion." Piers said. Nina gave a small humph of agreement, before Piers, Nina, and the other man resumed their conversation, ignoring Abby. Abby stood there for a few moments, unsure of what to do. The others ignored her, and Abby rolled her eyes before turning and starting to walk away. She walked a few steps before stopping. She realized that she needed this job. She couldn't just walk away. She needed to fight for it. She turned and walked back towards the others. 

 "You know, just because I don't know everything about fashion doesn't mean I'm not qualified for this job. I am a hard worker. I'm dedicated. I'll work my butt off. I'll learn this stuff as I go. Just because I'm not wearing things that you would consider fashionable doesn't mean I don't deserve this job." Abby said. She was shocked at herself. She couldn't believe she did this. Nina, Piers and the other man were staring at her. Audrey was as well. She was shocked. Nobody ever talked about to Nina that way. Nina walked up to Abby and stared her down. 

 "Very well." Nina said softly. Everyone in the room was shocked by this. Did Nina just hire this girl? Audrey was stunned. How could this girl, who clearly knew nothing about style, get this job? 

 "Thank you." Abby said. 

 "You start tomorrow. Be here early." Nina replied. 

 "Thanks. You won't regret it." Abby said, smiling cutely as she turned and walked away. 

 Nina looked at this girl and had one thought: this girl would regret it. This girl would regret getting this job. This girl had a little fight to her. Nina liked that. It would make breaking her all the more enjoyable. 

 Nina loved to demolish these young girls. Nina loved breaking down these young, smug bitches who thought they knew better. It was her biggest hobby. To take these proud, independent women, and show them that they didn't compare to her. Nina loved to prove her superiority to other women. 

 Why did Nina love to break down these, young, proud women? Why did she enjoy ruining these young bitches lives? Why did she want to emotionally destroy these women? It was quite simple: Nina was an egomaniac. She loved to stroke her own ego by tearing these women apart until they feel as if they don't belong in the same world as her. Nina loved to make these bitches feel like Nina was in a world above theirs, a world in which they would never know. 

 This girl Abby thought she was so much better than them. She looked down at them for being in the fashion industry. Nina saw that this girl was happy and full of hope for her future. That would make this more fun. Nina would enjoy breaking her. Nina would enjoy breaking this girl down, showing her what a tough place the world really was. Nina would ride her hard until she couldn't handle it anymore. Abby would regret ever meeting her. 

 ********** 

 Abby's husband Nathan cracked open a bottle of wine in celebration. They were standing in the kitchen of their small apartment. 

 "Congrats, sweetie." Nathan said as he leaned down to kiss his wife. They had married right out of college. Nathan was a chef. He had a dream of running his own restaurant, so he went to school for business, while working in restaurants, further developing his natural talents at cooking. It was at school where he met Abby. It was puppy love for them. Nathan had admired Abby's drive and ambition for making the world a better place. The fact that she was extremely pretty didn't hurt matters. Abby admired Nathan's fit body, good looks, and his smooth demeanor. Nathan was extremely laid back, and his good looks and calm demeanor made him a winner with women. He was also one of those people who was good at whatever he did. He was naturally talented. Abby felt lucky to have found such a great guy, and to have this great guy like her was an amazing feeling. 

 Nathan had supported her during her job search, both emotionally and financially. He was supportive of every decision she made. He was a good husband. 

 "Thanks, honey." Abby said with a bright smile, taking a wineglass from him. He had been so excited when she broke the news to him. That made her love him more. 

 "So, what are you gonna be doing?" Nathan asked. 

 "I don't know. Just assist her, I guess. Not what I wanted to do, exactly, but it gets my foot in the door." Abby said. 

 "Exactly." Nathan said, "So what's the woman you're working for like?" 

 "Well..." Abby started, "To be honest, she seems like kind of a bitch." 

 "Really?" Nathan asked. 

 "Yeah. She's exactly what you think of when you think of think of those women in the fashion industry. She seems like a bitchy, shallow old lady." Abby said. "It'll be an adventure." 

 "Hey, we should meet up with Ralph and Cori. I'm sure they'll be pumped for this." Nathan suggested. 

 "Sure." Abby said. 

 Ralph and Cori were their two closest friends in New York. Since Nathan and Abby had moved to the city six months prior, Ralph and Cori were the two people they had become closest to. Ralph and Cori were not a couple, just close friends. Ralph was one of those guys that knew a little bit about everything in New York. He was the perfect guy to know for New York newcomers. Cori was an artist that had been trying to get things going in the city. She had had some moderate success, but not had her big break. 

 Abby called them to break the good news. They were both pumped to hear the good news, and agreed to meet with Abby and Nathan for a celebratory dinner. 

 ********* 

 "Cheers!" Cori said, their glasses meeting in the middle of the table. They had met up at a restaurant, one of the nicer ones in town. All four of them took a sip of their wine. 

 "So, where are you working?" Ralph asked. He only knew that she got a job at a magazine. 

 "I'm working at 'Style' magazine. I'm gonna be the personal assistant to Nina Baxter." Abby said. Ralph almost coughed up his drink. 

 "You're working for Nina Baxter?" Ralph asked. 

 "You've heard of her?" Abby asked, surprised. 

 "Of course I have. She's like one of the biggest fashion icons in the world." Ralph said. "I can't believe you're working for her. That's a pretty prestigious job. There are thousands of girls that would kill for that job." 

 "Really?" Abby asked. 

 "Yeah. She knows everybody in this town. I bet you're gonna make a ton of connections. I guarantee, if you get through this job, you'll get a great job immediately." Ralph said. 

 "If I get through this job?" Abby asked. 

 "Yeah. From what I've heard, Nina Baxter is a stone cold bitch. Like, a bitch beyond everything you've ever seen." Ralph said. 

 "That's kinda the impression I got." Abby said. 

 "Yeah, she will put you through the fire. If you're tough enough to survive her, you will be set for life." Ralph added. 

 "Cool it, Ralph. You're scaring her." Cori said, slapping Ralph's arm. Ralph was a big guy, not fat, just a tall, big guy. Cori was a small, cute young black woman, so her slap did no damage. 

 "So, when do you start?" Cori asked. 

 "Tomorrow." Abby said. 

 "Wow, that's fast." Cori said. 

 "I'll do what I have to do." Abby said. 

 "Well, honey, I wish you luck." Cori said. 

 "Thanks. I'll probably need it." Abby said. Nathan leaned over and kissed her cheek. 

 ********** 

 Abby showed up at work around seven, not sure what specific time she needed to be there. There were people at work already when she got there. She reached her desk, and sat down at it, not sure what to do. She caught glimpses of Audrey, hustling around before sitting at her desk. Abby couldn't help but notice that despite her bitchy nature, she was uncommonly beautiful. And she had a good body too. Abby noticed that her breasts appeared to be unusually large for a girl her size. They weren't as big as Nina's gigantic boobs, but they were larger than most. Abby couldn't help but think, that if she were a less confident woman, she would feel inadequate. But, as all girls knew, breast size wasn't a big deal to most guys. Abby just smiled nicely at Audrey as she watched her hustle around. 

 Audrey saw Abby smile at her, but Audrey just rolled her eyes, which confused Abby. She didn't have time to dwell on it. She heard the sound of high heels clicking on the floor, and as she turned to look to see if it was Nina approaching. As she looked, all she saw was a coat being thrown at her face and a bag being thrown onto her desk. 

 Abby was taken aback by this. She didn't know what to do till she saw Audrey gesture for her to hang the coat up. Abby stood and hung the coat up in a closet behind her. She put Nina's bag in there as well. As she looked back at Audrey, she saw her rush into the office. Abby followed behind her. 

 She walked in to find Nina giving instructions to Audrey tersely. Without looking up, Nina started talking at her. 

 "Pamela, dear, can you call up Versace and see if their ready for to meet with me." Nina said. Abby looked over shoulder to see who she was talking to. She realized she was talking to her. 

 "Um, my name is..." Abby started before being cut off. 

 "That's all." Nina said softly, dismissing her. 

 Audrey quickly walked out, and Abby had no choice but to follow. As they left the office, Abby called out to Audrey. 

 "What do I do?" Abby asked. Audrey just smiled mischievously. She gave Abby a number to call. Audrey studied Abby as she tried to call Versace, and fail miserably, being hung up on quickly. Audrey smiled, dialed the same number, and did in five seconds what Abby couldn't do in five minutes. 

 That was the story of Abby's life the first few weeks on the job. She felt as if she was a step behind at all times. She felt like she didn't have enough training. They just expected her to know what to do. Abby did pick up a few things, but she always got the impression that what she was doing was not quite good enough. 

 She did not know that things were going exactly as Nina had planned. Nina always started off quickly. Light physical attacks, by tossing her bag and coat at her. At first, she would toss them onto the desk. In the coming weeks, this would progress to Nina tossing her stuff directly at Abby. First, the tosses would be light. This would progress until Nina was tossing her bag roughly at Abby, with enough force to bruise her. 

 That was one of only a few attacks she had planned to break this girl down. She would not call her by her actual name. She would give her tasks that she had no idea how to do. She would give her impossible tasks. This light emotional berating would be a good start. 

 This light attack was generally enough to weed out the truly weak women. Nina went through assistants like a shark attacking wounded prey. Most of her assistants didn't stand a chance. Audrey was one of the few that had lasted. Nina thought that that was due to the fact that Audrey shared Nina's cold nature. But Audrey wasn't ambitious. She was just a bitch, so she wasn't as much fun to play with. The ones who put up a fight were the bright, idealistic girls. Nina thought that Abby had some spunk. She would be a worthy challenger. 

 ********* 

 Abby did not enjoy herself at all for the first few weeks. This office was full of uncommonly beautiful women. It felt like she was in high school again, the way they treated her. Abby saw the women roll their eyes at her, either about her choice of clothing or her struggles around her office. Audrey showed Abby very little respect, as did Audrey's friends. 

 The worst, by far, was Nina. She was even worse than advertised. It wasn't that she was outwardly mean. She was extremely well spoken and rarely raised her voice. But the way she dealt with Abby seemed evil. Her style of humiliating Abby was more psychological. She gave Abby tasks that she had no idea how to do. She would make snide comments about Abby's failures. Abby got the impression that Nina enjoyed the humiliation. 

 Abby would go retrieve a steak for Nina for lunch from her favorite restaurant, only for Nina to disapprove, it not being cooked to her liking. She would send Abby to various designers to retrieve items of clothing, but Nina would tell her she retrieved the wrong items. She tried to have Abby arrange a private flight from Miami when she was stuck down there during a hurricane, even when the airport was closed. It was an impossible job! The worst was the fact that Nina refused to learn her name. She repeatedly called her Pamela. That really pissed Abby off, but there was nothing she could do about it. Nina was the boss. Also, Nina throwing her coat and bag into her face everyday didn't help matters.  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© The most embarrassing moment came when Abby had to deliver a book detailing some of the new clothing coming out. Nina was at home, and Abby would have to deliver it to her house personally. Audrey had done this job before, and she had passed off this errand to Abby. Audrey laid out very detailed instructions on what to do when she arrived at Nina's house. Walk in, go straight into a hallway, and set it on a particular table. It must be on that particular table. Don't go upstairs, don't disturb Nina, don't deviate from the instructions. 

 Abby took a cab to Nina's home, book in hand. The cab stopped outside of a large house in one of the nicer areas in the city. It was a few stories tall. It was the type of house Abby dreamed of having. Abby stepped up to the door, and cautiously opened the door up. She stepped into the hallway and as she followed the instructions Audrey gave her, she realized there were two tables she could put the book on. Abby knew Nina wanted things done her way, so Abby just stood there, trying to figure out which table to put the book on. 

 "Hey." she heard, a whispering voice from the side. 

 Abby looked over and saw two small children peeking out of a door. It was two little girl's. Abby was shocked by this. She never got the impression that Nina had kids. 

 "Where do I put this?" Abby asked. 

 "You can take it upstairs." one of the girls said. 

 "Are you sure?" Abby asked, remembering being told specifically not to go upstairs. 

 "It's okay. Go to the third floor." the other little girl said. 

 Abby nodded to them and started to slowly head upstairs. She went up slowly, not sure if she was doing the right thing. As she reached the second floor and started to head towards the third, she started to hear a creaking noise. This caused her to pause before she continued. 

 The creaking got louder as she got closer to the third floor. As she reached the third floor, she looked to her left, looking for the source of the creaking. She was staring at a closed door. Then, she heard a noise that erased all doubt of what was going on. 

 "Oh, fuck yes! Keep fucking me! C'mon! Harder! Harder!" a voice said, the unmistakable voice of Nina. 'Holy crap' Abby thought. Nina was having sex! Abby heard the fast creaking of the bed, and the unmistakable sound of skin slapping together. Whatever going on behind that door was fast and rough. 

 "Just cum in me! C'mon, do it! Cum in me! Please!" Abby heard Nina beg. She heard both Nina and her partner groan loudly as simultaneous orgasm hit them both. Abby was frozen to the spot, terrified of being caught. As the sounds disappeared, Abby started to move. The silence was torn apart by the loud squeal of the floor board as Abby moved. Abby realized she was about to be caught, so she started to rush downstairs. She was not quick enough, as the door opened and she heard footsteps start to approach. She was at the landing on the stairs when Nina came into view. 

 Nina was wearing a golden silk robe. She was just closing up her robe as she appeared to Abby's view. Even as she closed the robe, Abby couldn't help but notice Nina's large breasts forcing their way out, bursting to be uncovered. Her large cleavage was exposed. Abby had never seen Nina this dressed down. Her body was still covered in sweat, evidence of the rough sex she just had. 

 "What are you doing here?" Nina asked. 

 "I'm so sorry. I just... came to deliver this book." Abby replied. Nina looked down at her, literally and metaphorically. Nina was clearly angry. 

 "Well, bring it up here." Nina said angrily. Abby walked up the stairs and handed Nina the book. She could smell sex in the air. Abby looked over at the now open door. She saw a handsome older man, half covered. He was moving slowly, as if he had just been through a battle. 

 "That's all." Nina said, looking right at Abby. Abby apologized again and hurried down the stairs. She rushed out of the house, mortified. 

 Nina's attitude worsened towards her the next day. Work got harder and harder for Abby. She could never do well enough. Nina would give her order after order, and never give her any praise. 

 Nina was having fun with this girl. This girl Abby had hung tough, and Nina was ready to step up her game. While Abby catching her having sex with her husband was not part of the plan, it didn't hurt matters. In fact, it quite helped things. Nina took great pride in giving Abby a glimpse of what real sex was. Real sex by a real woman. Not that namby-pamby lovemaking that girls like Abby no doubt performed. Nina loved to show the fact that she was capable of things in the bedroom that no young girl could dream of doing. 

 Nina was an expert in rough, brutal fucking. The kind that most men couldn't handle. The kind of fucking where it took normal men days to recover from. Nina was a highly sexual woman. Years and years of practice had led Nina to become a spectacular fuck. 

 Nina's husband used to be able to come close to matching her. But as he aged, his stamina waned, while hers only increased. As they aged, he had become a lame fuck, while she only got better and better. Her husband basically just lied there and let Nina attempt to slake her gross, disgusting sexual needs. While she always wanted their fucks to become nastier and nastier, he always refused, knowing he couldn't keep up with her. He knew he couldn't handle what she wanted. Night after night, she attempted to slake her thirst for rough, nasty sex, but she could never get there. Her husband had become too weak of a man sexually to give her the pleasure she craved. Due to this, their marriage was on the rocks. Could Nina saddle herself with a man who could pleasure her like she truly needed? 

 ********* 

 For the first month or two, Abby was being run ragged at work. To be honest, she hated her job. A lot of her conversations at home with Nathan would end up being her bitching to Nathan about Nina or the other bitches she worked with. Nathan listened to her and let her vent. He was very supportive to his wife. And he believed her. He could just tell that this Nina woman was a bitch. 

 It was about two months into the job when things started to change. Abby was working late. Nina and Audrey had both gone home. As Abby worked at her computer, Piers walked into Nina's office to drop something off. As he walked back out, he spoke to Abby. 

 "How are you doing, honey?" he asked. She looked up at him. 

 "Well, it's been something." Abby said, having trouble hiding her true feelings. 

 "Honey, I've seen a lot of girls in that chair. A thousand girls would kill to be where you're at." Piers said. 

 "I keep hearing that." Abby said. 

 "You want my advice?" Piers said. 

 "Sure." Abby said. 

 "I think the problem is that you don't take this job seriously." Piers started. 

 "I do! I try my best, but I never feel like its good enough." Abby said. 

 "You don't take the fashion industry seriously. Abby, I think you look down at us. I think that you believe you are above us. You need to show that you take this industry seriously. And you can't try your best. To get anywhere, you need to go above and beyond. That's what it takes." Piers said. Abby listened, taking his words to heart. 

 "What do you think I should do?" Abby asked. 

 "Honey, you need to learn everything you can about fashion. You need to dive in headfirst. And to be honest, sweetie, you need to dress better." he replied. 

 "I like how I dress." she replied. 

 "You're in the fashion industry, Abby. You need to dress the part." Piers said. "I tell you what, tomorrow at six, come down to my office. I can make something out of you." 

 Abby agreed. Piers left the office. Abby resolved herself to improve. 

 ********* 

 Abby felt like a fashion model as she dealt with Piers. Piers had her try on outfit after outfit, trying to find out which looked flattered her best. Piers posed her in mirrors, and him and his assistants put her though outfit after outfit. Abby learned a lot by doing this. She learned some of the fashion terms she didn't previously understand. Finally, she left with a collection of fashionable outfits. 

 As she emerged in her apartment that morning in her new outfit, she saw Nathan's jaw drop. 

 "Wow." he said, admiring his wife. He had never seen her look better. 

 "You like?" she said with a smile. 

 "I really like." he said, reaching around her and pulling her into an embrace. They kissed a few times before Abby pushed him away. 

 "C'mon, I gotta go. Save it for tonight." Abby said with a giggle. She finally pulled away from him after another kiss and headed out to work. 

 Abby had to admit that it felt great to walk into the office and to see the jaws of the other girls drop. Abby had to admit she looked damn good in this new outfit she was wearing. Audrey looked shocked, as did her friends. She even overheard one of Audrey's friends admit that Abby looked good. That made Abby smile. 

 Even Nina noticed her. She didn't say anything, but she definitely noticed. 

 Abby took Piers advice and threw herself into her work. She learned everything she could about fashion and the fashion industry. And it started to show. She was able to contribute more and more. And Nina appreciated it, in her own way. She started to include Abby in on things. She included Abby as she went to appraise some of the new products one of the famous fashion moguls was putting out. It was there that Abby learned from Audrey about Nina's way of judging whether she liked something or not. If Nina liked something, she would give a slight nod. That's it. Many fashion designers dreams were crushed by not seeing that slight nod. Fashion designers lived and died by that nod. 

 As Abby's knowledge of the fashion world grew, so did her responsibilities. She was quickly involved in more important jobs. Nina told Audrey to memorize a list of names of people that were going to be attending a party she was attending. Audrey would be there as support for Nina. But, Audrey caught the flu, and was struggling to memorize the names. The day of the party, Nina noticed Audrey struggling, and gave the list to Abby, telling her to memorize the list, as she was now attending the party as well. Abby wanted to tell her no, since Ralph's birthday party was the same night, but she knew there was no telling Nina now. Abby got to memorizing the list. 

 Abby called Nathan to break the news. She told him she would be late, but she would try to make it. Nathan wasn't happy, but he understood. 

 Piers provided nice dresses for all of them to wear. Abby looked nice in a long, flowing dress. Audrey looked nice too, but was offset by her obvious sickness. Nina looked stunning in the dark blue dress Piers provided, the low cut dress exposing her monumental cleavage. 

 Abby felt out of place at this high end party. Audrey and her both hung next to Nina. Audrey was doing a good job of providing the names of people Nina didn't know. That was until an older women, with salt and pepper hair started to approach. It didn't take a genius to know who she was. She was Dolores Tenhooven, Nina's counterpart at a different magazine. But the person she was with, a regal looking older gentlemen, was a mystery to Nina. 

 "Who is he?" Nina whispered to Audrey. Abby could see Audrey struggling to find the name in her head. Abby saw her opportunity. 

 "He's Sir Henrik Williamson. He is the prince of a country in Europe and she is Dolores's current squeeze." Abby said. Dolores reached them. 

 "Dolores! So great to see you. And this must be Henrik." Nina said. They greeted her happily, even though it was well publicized the animosity between Nina and Dolores. 

 Abby looked past Nina at Audrey. Audrey mouthed the words "Thank you." Abby smiled. Abby saw the opportunity to sneak away for a bit, so she went to the bar to get a drink. As she ordered, she was approached from behind. 

 "Hello." A man's voice said. Abby turned to look at a handsome man looking down at her. He had a mop of blonde hair and a boyish face. 

 "Hi." Abby said cautiously, not sure who this was. 

 "My name is Simon Miller." he said, holding his hand out. That name rang a bell. Abby realized who this was, Simon Miller was one of the leading publishing magnates in the city. 

 "Oh my god. I've heard a lot about you." Abby said, shaking his hand. 

 "I heard you are Nina Baxter's new assistant." he said. 

 "Yeah, I am." Abby replied. 

 "How's that going?" he asked. 

 "It's something." Abby said with a smile. 

 "Trust me, everyone knows what kind of woman she is. She eats most of her assistants alive. You've probably been there longer than most of them." Simon said. 

 "Well, it hasn't been easy." Abby said. 

 "What's your background? Where did you go to school?" Simon asked. 

 "I went to Northwestern for journalism, and this is my first job outside of school." Abby said. 

 "Really? Send your resume my way. If you're interested that is." Simon said, handing her a card. 

 "Oh, well thank you." Abby said, pocketing the card, glancing up at the handsome stranger. Abby chatted with Simon for a few minutes. Abby got the impression he was flirting. Abby looked over at Audrey, and saw her gesturing for her to come back. 

 "I gotta go." Abby said apologetically. 

 "Have fun." Simon replied with a smile. 

 ********* 

 Nina had to admit she was starting to be impressed by Abby. Her assistant actually started to dress like a woman, and Nina was impressed that Abby was able to look decent. She was a prettier girl than Nina had originally thought. Plus, Abby had started to illustrate that she was willing to learn. She had bailed Audrey out, and she had shown Nina that she was capable of doing good work in the fashion industry. But she couldn't give Abby any hint of praise. In fact, Nina knew the only way to go forward was to treat her even worse. 

 Abby had shown she was capable to Nina. Abby thought things would improve. But that didn't seem enough for Nina. Nina called Abby into her office. As Abby walked in and looked at Nina, she couldn't help but marvel once again at her boss's good looks and spectacular body. Even from a woman's perspective, she would have to admit Nina was gorgeous. The fact that she was older somehow did not detract from her attractiveness. She still had a fantastic, fit, voluptuous body. Abby could only hope to have a body that good when she got older. Nina had left the top few buttons of her blouse unbuttoned, so Abby couldn't help but have her eye's drawn to Nina's generous cleavage, which was just pouring out. Without looking up at her, Nina started to speak. 

 "My daughters are going to be taking a long train ride, and they need something to keep them entertained. You know those books about the boy wizard, I can't recall the title. I've heard that the author has an unpublished manuscript for an eighth book. My girls love those stories, and they are desperate to know what happens next. The author said she would never release it. I want that manuscript in my daughter's hands by the time they get on the train. If they do not get it, don't bother coming back." 

 "What? That's impossible!" Abby replied, confused. 

 "That's all." Nina said, dismissively. 

 Abby walked out of the office angrily. If she would have looked back, she would have seen Nina smirk ever so slightly. Nina thought she had won this one. There was no way Abby could do this. 

 Nina had thought she was making progress with Nina. Not so, apparently. Nina just gave her an impossible task. Abby had no idea where to start. She made a few calls, but people just laughed in her face at her request. Then, she remembered Simon. She had sent him her resume, but had not heard back. But he was in the publishing industry. If anyone could help her, it would be him. She called him up. 

 "Simon Miller." Simon said. 

 "Simon, this is Abby Cline." Abby said. 

 "Abby! Nice to talk to you again. How can I help you?" Simon replied. Abby quickly explained what Nina wanted. Abby asked if he could help. 

 "Hmm, that's a pretty tall task, Abby. I tell you what. I know some people. Let me make a few calls and see what I can turn up. Okay?" Simon asked. 

 "Okay. Sounds good." Abby said. As they said their goodbyes and Abby hung up, she didn't hold out much hope of Simon being able to help. She looked around the office, and realized she didn't stand a chance here. Nina gave her this task simply so she would fail. Nina wanted Abby to fail. With that, Abby stood up, and walked out of the office. If she was not wanted here, then she didn't want to be here. She went out into the streets of New York. She heard her phone ring. She pulled it out and saw it was Nathan. 

 She knew Nathan had not been happy with the time she had to put in at this job. She had been forced to miss a lot of stuff in order to keep Nina happy. Nathan understood, but that didn't mean he was happy about it. Abby had missed meeting up with friends and some other parties and events that Nathan had been looking forward to. But Nathan had been supportive. He knew how much she needed this job, so he let it slide. 

 "Hey, what's up?" Abby said. 

 "Hey, just wanted to see if you still wanted to meet for lunch." Nathan said. 

 "Yeah, sure. Listen. I think I just quit." Abby said. 

 "What? Really?" Nathan said excitedly. 

 "Yeah, I think so." Abby said, unsure if she should be happy. 

 "What happened?" Nathan asked. 

 "I'll tell you everything when we meet up. Okay?" Abby said. 

 "Okay. See you soon. Love you." Nathan said. 

 "Love you too." Abby said, hanging up. She was about put her phone back in her purse when it started ringing again. She looked down and saw it was Simon. 

 "Hello." Abby said. 

 "Abby, you owe me." Simon said. 

 "What do you mean?" she asked. 

 "I've got it." Simon replied. 

 "What?" Abby said, still confused. 

 "I got the manuscript." Simon said. 

 "How?" Abby asked. 

 "Well, it's complicated. I know a guy who knows a guy who knows guy, that type of thing. All that matters is that I have the manuscript in my hand right now." Simon replied. 

 "That's great, but I think I just quit." Abby said. 

 "I did all that work. I cashed in a lot of favors for this Abby. I think you should reconsider." Simon said, not angry. 

 "Well, I appreciate it, but..." Abby started. 

 "Well, you can at least meet up with me. See if I can't change your mind." Simon replied. 

 "Okay. Where do you want to meet up?" Abby asked. 

 "How about you meet me for a cup of coffee? We can talk there." he said. 

 "Okay, sounds good." Abby replied. 

 Half an hour later, Abby met up with Simon in a coffee shop. They chatted for a bit, and Simon explained again what a huge opportunity this job was for her. He explained that Nina gave her this task simply so she would fail. Simon told her to imagine the look on her face when she handed the manuscript over. This more than anything convinced her to stay. Simon handed over the huge stack of papers that was the manuscript. Abby was extremely appreciative. Simon let her know that he would move her resume to the top of his list. 

 As Abby walked back to work, she got a call from Nathan. 

 "Hey, where you at?" he asked. 

 "I'm on my way back to work." Abby said. 

 "Why?" he said, disappointed. 

 "It's just, this is a job that a thousand girls want to have. I can't just walk away. I'm not a quitter." Abby said. 

 Nathan was disappointed, but he understood. He supported her, like a good husband. 

 Abby walked into Nina's office. Nina looked up and watched as Abby placed the manuscript on her desk. 

 "I got it. I got the manuscript!" Abby said happily. Nina grabbed the manuscript and started leafing through it. Abby wondered what complaint she could find with her on this one. 

 "Well, what good is it to me here?" Nina said. 

 "Don't worry. I made two copies and took them to your home. The manuscripts are in your daughters' hands as we speak." Abby said, knowing she was a step ahead of Nina for once. Nina looked at her. Abby saw a flash of emotion on her face, a look that showed she was impressed.  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© "That's all." Nina said, not quite as dismissive as normal. 

 ********* 

 Nina was shocked. She had to admit she was now very impressed by Abby. Abby had done a task she thought was impossible. Nina realized that Abby was not a typical young girl. This girl was a fighter. Nina didn't think any woman could withstand her onslaught, but Abby had. Maybe Nina had finally met her match. Maybe she had met a girl who she couldn't beat. Nina didn't think it was possible, but here it was. This didn't bother her. In fact, she was quite pleased. The thought of having a protégé intrigued her. Nina thought that having someone who was as tough as her, as capable as her, and as ambitious as her could be a good thing. Nina liked the thought that having someone who she could train and cultivate. Nina realized that Abby was someone who could eventually take over for her in the future. If Abby could keep it up, she would be living the good life soon. 

 Abby's relationship with Nina had improved from frosty to lukewarm. In Abby's opinion, she had surpassed Audrey as Nina's go-to girl. Nina trusted Abby for everything now that she showed how capable she was. Abby no longer had to ask Audrey for help. If anything, Audrey had to come to Abby so she could find out what was going on. Abby had quickly become indispensable to Nina. 

 Abby was extremely busy, but she was able to find time to meet with Nathan, Ralph and Cori for dinner one night. Ralph and Cori hadn't seen Abby in awhile, so they were happy to see her. Things were going great until Abby's phone started to ring. As she reached to grab it, Cori grabbed it away. 

 "Ooh, it's Nina." Cori said, smiling. 

 "Hey, give it back." Abby said, reaching to grab her phone. Cori handed the phone to Ralph. 

 "C'mon. Ralph!" Abby said, as she ran over to him to grab the phone. As she approached, he handed the phone to Nathan. The phone kept ringing, as if mocking her. It made her more impatient. She was able to grab Nathan's hands, and was finally able to wrench her phone from his grasp. They were all laughing. 

 "You guys are assholes." Abby said, answering the phone as she walked outside. 

 Nathan followed her, and as he joined her outside, she had just finished her call. 

 "I'm sorry, Abby." Nathan said. 

 "I'm going back to work." Abby said coldly. 

 "Don't be mad, Abby" Nathan said. 

 "This is my job, Nathan. It's not a joke." Abby said. 

 "I thought you hated your job." Nathan replied. 

 "Right now..." she said, as she hailed down a cab, "It's not my job I hate." She stepped into the cab and drove away. 

 Nathan watched her drive away. He was disappointed in what she had become. Abby was not as fun loving as she used to be. She had always been career-driven but now she was an ambitious, almost corporate, girl. Her job had become her life. She had alienated her friends, and she had been distant from Nathan. He still loved her, but he hated to see what that Nina woman had made out of her. He hated Nina for doing this to them. He hated to see his wife at this woman's beck and call. He didn't understand how his normally independent wife could, under the influence of this woman, become so submissive. 

 ********* 

 Abby had been working day in and day out with Nina, so he started to pick up details about her. No one knew how old she really was. She was obviously older, as she had been in the public eye for some time. And her silver hair obviously indicated her age, as did the slight wrinkles on her face. But her hot body indicated otherwise. Her body was not one that had fallen apart with age. Nina was fit, with full, bulging breasts and a perfect, round, heart-shaped ass. Her body had filled out perfectly as she aged, forming the complete, smooth, sexy package that only a mature woman could have. She had a body that younger women would envy. Abby sure did. 

 While no one knew exactly where she grew up, all they did know was that she started as a model. But her keen business sense led her in the direction of management, and she quickly rose to power. 

 Nina was built for high society. So it was no surprise she married a member of high society, the CEO of a fortune 500 company. Her two daughters soon followed. Abby had only had glimpses of Nina's husband. The incident at Nina's house was the first time she had ever seen him. He had stopped by the office a few times, and, although he was handsome, Abby was not impressed by him. For such a rich, successful man, Abby was surprised at how Nina pretty much dominated their relationship. It was clear that Nina's attitude was the same at home as it was at the office. Abby was a bit surprised to see this successful CEO not wear the pants in the relationship. He deferred to Nina on just about every decision. If Nina told him to jump, he would ask how high. 

 Abby also got brief glimpses at Nina's sexual nature. Abby was shocked to notice how men behaved around Nina. Whenever any straight man in the fashion industry was around her, they behaved like smitten teenagers. Men flirted with Nina like crazy. And Abby was shocked to see that Nina was surprisingly receptive to these men's advances. Most shocking was how Nina drew the attention of the hunky male models. Abby was shocked to see these muscular, gorgeous young men flirting with her bitchy, domineering female boss. Seeing this level of intimacy made Abby wonder if there was something there. Abby started to wonder whether or not her boss was having affairs with some male models. 

 Abby didn't know whether her boss was capable of cheating on her husband. To Abby, cheating on your spouse was one of the worst things you could do. She viewed it as such a betrayal of trust. Abby didn't understand how someone could betray someone they vowed to love and cherish. Abby didn't know whether Nina was capable of that. Sure, she was cold, but there had to be something there that kept their marriage going. She couldn't be that evil as to cheat, could she? 

 It wasn't just the flirting that gave Abby a whiff that something was up. Every week, Nina would have a set meeting with a handsome, male masseuse. During this meeting, the office doors would be shut tight and Nina would sternly warn Abby not to disturb her. An hour later, the masseuse would emerge, looking like he had just had a strenuous workout. And Nina would be in a slightly better mood. Abby hoped what she thought was happening wasn't the case. 

 ********* 

 Nina had enjoyed the occasional fling from time to time. In recent years, as her sex life with her husband had started to fade, she knew the only way to maintain her sanity was to get some on the side. She was too highly sexually charged to get by on her husband's increasingly lame sexual efforts. Nina loved her husband, and she loved her daughters dearly, but she couldn't deny her true nature. Nina needed sex and if her husband couldn't keep up with her, she would find someone who could. 

 Nina had always had had men staring at her. She always knew she was hot. As she got older, she noticed that the men who were enamored with her were getting younger. Nina knew the effect she had on young men. She had gotten very good at noticing the looks these young men would give her. So, Nina indulged herself in them. They were mainly models or rich playboys. These men were better fucks than her husband, but there was still something missing. Nina was surprised that these young, virile young men still had trouble keeping up with her. These boys talked a big game, but once Nina got them between the sheets, they were woefully easy to dominate. Sure, she got pleasure in bringing big, strong men down to their knees. But most of the men she fucked were too easy. They didn't put up a fight. They were willing to be dominated. Nina wanted to find a man who didn't want to be dominated. Nina wanted a man who was resistant. Reluctant. She wanted a man who would fight back, but deep down wanted to be dominated. Until that time, she would continue with her many affairs. 

 Nina's current favorite boy-toy was her masseuse, Alberto. She had been in desperate need of a masseuse, so she got in contact with the top massage agency in the city, one that catered to upper-class clientele. Alberto visited her home, when she was there alone, for an hour long session. Alberto was a handsome Latino man, exceedingly buff, with a strong accent. Nina noted how nervous Alberto seemed. Nina was wearing a thin silk robe, and as she started to climb onto the massage table, she was unashamed to slip the robe from her shoulders and flash this young man she hardly knew her bare ass. She rested on her stomach, and Alberto couldn't help but notice her massive tits balloon outward against the table. 

 Alberto seemed terrified to get close to Nina. But it was his job, so he knew he had to. Something about this woman made him nervous. She inspired unexpected feelings in him. At first glance, he just thought she was just some rich, middle-aged, New York housewife. But something about her struck a deep chord in him and inspired strange feelings... sexual feelings. He didn't understand why. He had a lovely girlfriend, about his age. But this woman was clearly older, with silver hair. But she wasn't an old lady by any means. He was 25, and he realized that she could possibly be double that. But there was something about her. Something inherently sexy. He felt drawn to her for some reason, and that terrified him. He just wanted to get this one-hour session over with. He glanced at her and opened up a bottle of oil. He poured warm oil along her spine. He finally worked up the courage to put his hands on her. 

 It wasn't until six hours later that he took his hands off of her. He didn't know what had hit him. Words couldn't describe what had just happened to him. Nina pushed him out of her house in the middle of the night, but he didn't want to leave. He walked out gingerly. His hips were so sore he was barely able to walk. He had never felt like this. He walked out of Nina's house with bruised hips, balls emptier than they had ever been, and an agreement to meet with Nina once a week in her office. 

 It was Alberto that showed Nina something she had never encountered, which was a reluctant man driven nuts by her hot body. She had Alberto under her thumb completely now, and she had grown accustomed to his weekly visits. She enjoyed her sessions with him, but he was still too easy. He had barely put up a fight. Plus, she could tell he was not ready for the rough stuff. He filled her pussy up pretty well, and that was enough for now. It was the best she could get at this point, so she was more than happy to go with it. 

 She wanted to maintain her marriage, but as time went on, she started to consider the option of moving on. She was getting tired of the obligations she felt with him. Early on in the marriage, he was the bread winner, but now, she was the one raking it in. She was financially set for life. She still felt love for him, but as their sex life suffered, her love for him started to fade. Her marriage truly started to feel like an obligation. Nina felt like if she could find the right man, a nice, strong, young man that could provide the rough sex she needed, then she would jump out of her marriage and into one with her new boy-toy in an instant. 

 ********** 

 The next big upcoming event at work for Abby was the Paris Fashion Show. Nina went every year with her top advisors, such as Piers and a few others. Audrey would usually attend, and she assumed this year would be no different. Ever since Abby's first day, she had mentioned how much she was looking forward to Paris. Whenever she would go, she would come home with a pile of new dresses to wear. 

 Abby had never really thought much about this whole big Paris thing. Sure, she wanted to go to Paris at some point in her life, but she really had never really had her heart set on going to the fashion show. That was why she was surprised when Nina called her into her office to tell her the big news. 

 "You need to clear your schedule for next week." Nina said, looking at a paper she was reading. 

 "What for?" Abby asked. 

 "You will be accompanying me to Paris." Nina said. 

 "What? You're kidding?" Abby asked. 

 "I don't kid." Nina replied. 

 "What about Audrey? I thought she was going?" Abby asked. 

 "Audrey has gotten complacent. Lazy. She has lost her place in this." Abby said. 

 "I'm honored, but, I can't do that to her. She has been looking forward to this for months." Abby replied. 

 "You will do it. In fact, you will be the one to tell her that you've taken her place." Nina said. 

 "I can't do that to her..." Abby started. 

 "You can and you will. If you do not, then don't bother showing up. If you do, then, there might be an editor position opening up around here." Nina replied. 

 "But I..." Abby started. 

 "That's all." Nina said, dismissing her. 

 Abby was conflicted as she contemplated what she would do. She knew it was a mean thing to do to a person, to steal something they thought they had. But, an editor position would be huge for her career. That was why she put herself through the hell she had by working for Nina. It was the realization that her work would have been wasted that made her decision. Abby was going to Paris. 

 When Abby finally broke the news to Audrey, Audrey was incensed. Abby couldn't face her when she did it, so she called her when Audrey was out. Audrey was near hysterics as she ranted into the phone as she crossed the New York City streets. As Abby explained that she was taking her place, she felt a strange rush that she couldn't explain. Audrey was so incensed as she walked that she didn't see the car coming. Abby heard the crash, and was immediately worried. 

 Audrey ended up in the hospital with a broken leg and a few bruises. Abby felt like she had to visit. Abby feared she would face Audrey's wrath, but happily, Audrey was calm. Abby explained that Nina made her do this, and Audrey understood. Audrey knew how Nina was. Abby enjoyed having this conversation with Audrey, and for the first time, it felt like she was talking to the real Audrey. And she liked this version. Audrey told her to enjoy Paris. Abby comforted her by telling her there was always next year. 

 Two days later, Abby found herself again in the lap of luxury, riding on a private place to Paris. 

 ********* 

 The first day or so of Paris was crazy hectic. It wasn't until the first evening that Abby was able to settle down and semi-enjoy the fact that she was in Paris. She was sipping a glass of wine in her hotel room when she gathered up some notes about her plans for the next day. She decided to walk over to Nina's room to go over those plans. She knocked on the door and waited for the response. 

 Abby looked up as the door opened, and she immediately knew something was wrong. Nina's eyes were swollen, as if she had been crying. She had a wine glass in hand. She still looked spectacular, wearing a golden blouse over a black shirt, which scooped low enough to display a healthy amount of her two biggest assets. 

 "What's wrong?" Abby asked, stepping in. 

 Nina was conflicted. She didn't want to appear weak in front of Abby, but she needed someone to talk to. 

 "My husband filed papers for divorce." Nina said, sitting down. 

 "Oh my god, I'm so sorry." Abby said, sitting near her. 

 "It's been a long time coming. Our marriage isn't what it once was." Nina said. 

 "I'm so sorry. How are the girls taking it?" Abby asked. 

 "They're okay. They are strong girls. But, I worry about them. It's been a long time since I've been single. I want them to have a strong male influence around the house." Nina said, sipping wine. 

 "I'm sure you'll find someone." Abby said. Part of her doubted that. Nina was not a young woman anymore. She figured Nina would struggle to find a man willing to put up with her. Part of her wanted to say to just give up and accept the fact that she was going to have trouble finding a good man, but she couldn't say anything. Nina was a woman in need of assurance, and Abby needed to encourage her. 

 "Oh, I know. Even though my marriage is over, I still care about him." Nina said. 

 "I know it's tough. But you're strong. I know you can get over it." Abby reassured. They both sipped wine, and Abby could tell Nina had been drinking for awhile. 

 "What caused this, if you don't mind me asking?" Abby asked. 

 "Honestly, it was the sex." Nina started. Abby knew she was entering awkward territory, but before she could say anything, Nina continued. "I love my husband, but quite frankly, he didn't fuck me hard enough." 

 Abby's eyes opened wide in shock at this statement. She was shocked at Nina's frankness. Abby didn't want to imagine Nina having sex. Not that it was an unpleasant image. It was just weird to her. Abby wanted to move on, but Nina continued. 

 "I'm a woman. A woman with needs. And he has not met them for a long time. I like some pretty rough stuff, but he was unwilling to go as far as I wanted. That's where everything started. Sex is a huge part of a relationship for me, and he did not hold up his end of the bargain. I tried my best to bring the good stuff out of him, but some people are just untalented at that kind of stuff." Nina said, glancing up at Abby. 

 Luckily, the conversation moved on from sex. For the first time, Abby felt like she was having a true conversation with Nina. They talked for a long time. Nina opened up to her, talking about her past. Abby started to appreciate Nina for the first time. She now recognized that Nina was a dedicated, incredibly talented worker. Her methods of management were unorthodox, but they had made Abby better. Abby had to admit she was a stronger worker than ever before. For the first time, Abby realized she kinda liked Nina. No more hate. Only respect. They chatted like old girlfriends for a couple hours until they began to part for the evening. 

 As they reached the door, Abby turned and faced Nina. 

 "You'll find someone, Nina." Abby said. 

 "I know." Nina said, smiling lightly, but with confidence, and shut the door. 

 ********* 

 Nathan was irritated by the fact that Abby wasn't here with him. It wasn't that he wasn't supportive of her success. He was happy for her, but her success was affecting their personal life. Abby was ready to drop everything to prove herself to Nina, at all hours of the day. Often, Abby would come home late and roll into bed, too exhausted to spend any time with him. Ralph and Cori had both told him that they never saw her anymore. 

 The problem was Abby was no fun anymore. He missed the girl he married. He knew the cause of all of this: Nina. He knew very little about her, but all that mattered was that she was taking his sweet, good-natured wife away from him. She was running Abby ragged, and Abby just took it, in hopes of earning her respect. 

 All he knew was that if this new routine didn't end soon, he would have to do something about it. 

 ********** 

 Abby thought that her relationship had evolved after the previous night, but if it did, Nina showed no sign of it. She was as businesslike as ever. Abby was happy to notice that Nina was not outwardly mean to her. Small steps, Abby thought. 

 Nina was disappointed in herself for the previous night. She had had a moment of weakness, and Abby had been there to see the whole thing. Nina was disappointed that the mystique was now gone to Abby. Abby had evidence that Nina was a real human being. Abby had power over her, even if she didn't realize it. This was not satisfactory to her. Nina's instinct was to push her away, to treat her worse, but part of her felt affection for Abby. Abby had shown herself to be a quick learner and a hell of a worker. She had shown herself to be trustworthy, so Nina knew Abby wouldn't go blabbing to everyone that she had seen Nina cry. For now, Nina was safe.  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© The day was busy for both Nina and Abby. Abby had gotten separated from Nina, and it was at this point that she ran into Simon. Simon and her had been in contact, and had started to become friends. They chatted about work and other common interests. Abby got the impression that Simon was in to her. She was flattered, since he was a rich, handsome man, but she was not looking to cheat. She was not that type of girl. 

 Simon offered to meet with her for lunch. She accepted and met him at a small café near the hotel. They chatted for a bit before Simon dropped a bomb on her. 

 "Abby, I asked you here for more than just lunch." Simon started. Abby raised an eyebrow to this. 

 "I have been working with Dolores Tenhooven, and we are making a bid to buyout Nina and take over the magazine." Simon said. 

 "What?" Abby asked, confused. 

 "This has been in the works for awhile now." Simon asked. 

 "I don't believe it. Why are you telling me this?" Abby asked. 

 "We're afraid that word will get out about this. Nina cannot know about this. She is a warrior. If she finds out about this, she will find a way to stop it. Style magazine is the top property in the fashion industry. Many people have made plays to get the magazine from her, but she has survived. I don't know how, but she does. She has her ways." Simon started. 

 "I am telling you this because you are her shadow. You need to make sure she does not get a whiff of this. Okay? You have shown me that you a highly intelligent, ambitious woman. If you can hide this from her, there will be a spot for you when the magazine is under new management. You will be able to use your degree, for once." Simon finished. 

 "I don't know..." Abby said. 

 "Abby, I have heard all the horror stories about her. Nina is a dinosaur. Her style of management is outdated. She needs to go. You can stop her. You can put an end to her reign of terror. Abby, I've heard you talk about her. You know that she needs to be taken down." Simon urged. 

 "I know, but..." Abby started. 

 "Abby, this is a big opportunity for you." Simon said. 

 "I guess." Abby said. 

 "You don't sound convinced." Simon replied. Abby steeled herself. She couldn't let him down. 

 "Okay, I'll do it." Abby said. 

 "That's great." Simon said happily. "You won't regret it. Listen, I have to go. We'll be talking." he added, leaving. 

 Abby was conflicted for the rest of the day. She thought about whether she was capable of doing this to Nina. Sure, at first, Abby despised Nina. But she had to admit Nina's rough treatment had made her stronger. Abby now could say that she respected Nina. Nina was a strong, independent woman, a woman who was successful. And they had bonded. Abby had provided the proverbial shoulder to cry on. Nina was going through a divorce. Could any woman go through a divorce and losing her job back to back? Could Abby be cold enough to sell her out? Nina had shown her human side to her. She had opened up in a way she probably rarely had. Abby couldn't betray her after that, could she? 

 Abby didn't feel comfortable doing what Simon had asked. Sure, it was possibly a huge opportunity for her, under a boss who was easy to get along with. But, Nina had said that there was possibly a position opening up for her there. So either way, a job opportunity was there. So it came down to who Abby felt more comfortable with, and surprisingly enough, she felt like siding with Nina. 

 Abby next saw Nina as they met up before going to an event. Abby found an opportunity to talk with Nina one-on-one. 

 "Nina, listen, I heard a rumor." she started, internally wondering if she was making the right call. She knew she had Nina's fate in her hands. But she couldn't do it. She was too nice. Nina was texting somebody on her phone, but she was listening. 

 "I heard that Denise Tenhooven and Simon Miller are attempting to buy you out and take over the magazine." Abby said. Nina looked up from her phone at her. 

 "Are you sure?" Nina replied. 

 "Heard it straight from the source." Abby said. 

 "Interesting." Nina said quietly. "Well, don't worry. I'll take care of it." Nina said, walking away. 

 Abby was near Nina all day. They were kept busy, but Nina was on her phone as often as she could. At the end of the day, Nina was meeting with her closest advisors about some of the stuff going on in Paris. Nina was still on the phone. Abby watched her from afar, gauging her emotions. When Abby finally saw Nina put the phone down, Abby saw a slight smile on her lips. 

 Abby's suspicions were confirmed when she received a call from Simon the next morning. Abby readied herself and answered. Before she could say anything, he started speaking. 

 "Did you tell her?" Simon growled, clearly angry. 

 "I..." Abby started nervously. 

 "You did it, didn't you." Simon said. "I can't believe it. That's years of work down the drain!" 

 "The deal fell through?" Abby asked. 

 "Of course it did! Why did you do it? Why did you tell her?" Simon asked angrily. 

 "She's not as bad as you think." Abby said. 

 "She's worse! I can't believe you don't see it. I thought you were smarter than that!" Simon said. 

 "I don't know what else to say." Abby said. 

 "You don't have to say anything. I can't believe I wasted my time on you. Fucking bitch." Simon replied, hanging up. 

 Abby was shocked. Simon had been using her. Simon had been using her to keep tabs on Nina, and to make his own deal happen. Abby was shocked that she had been used like that. How could she have not seen that? 

 What Simon had told her was correct. The deal had fallen through. In fact, somehow, Nina had turned it around on them, using her lawyer's and her connections, and had taken a chunk out of Dolores's and Simon's empire. Nina had been able to buy out one of the magazine's they ran, and had cleaned out a lot of the staff. Abby hoped that with all of the open positions at this new magazine, there would be one for Abby, one that would utilize her skills. 

 As Abby flew home on the private jet, Nina struck up a conversation with her. 

 "I appreciate you helping me out Abby. It might take some time to get this new magazine straightened out, but once we do, I'm sure we can find a job for you there." Nina said. 

 "Thank you." Abby replied, smiling. 

 Abby was happy. She had gotten hired by the baddest bitch in the city. Everyone told her to beware of Nina. But Abby had gone in, worked hard, and earned the respect of won the respect of one of the most powerful women in the city. She had gone to battle with the toughest businesswoman around, and she had come out victorious. Abby had won. 

 ********* 

 Work had been better for Abby. Nina was still tough, but she was not as bad to her as she used to be. The other magazine was still being straightened out, so Abby was still working her usual job. Audrey was back at work. Things were frosty at first between them, but Abby provided an olive branch. She offered to give Audrey all of the dresses she had gotten in Paris. These dresses were probably worth quite a bit of money, but Abby knew this stuff wasn't her style. 

 Audrey tried to retain her cool demeanor, but Abby could tell she was touched by it. Abby's relationship with Audrey improved after that. 

 Things were going well for Abby, in all facets. She couldn't be happier. She had worked hard for years, and now, things were starting to go her way. 

 ********* 

 Nathan was not happy. To be honest, he was worried about Abby. For months, Abby had ranted and raved about her boss, Nina. Abby had hated Nina. But suddenly, Nina was Abby's idol. Abby had been happy to tell him the story about how she had helped Nina save her job. Nathan felt a strange disappointment as he heard this. 

 It seemed like Nina had put a spell over Abby, making her into a different person. Abby had become so different. She was all business anymore. He still loved her, but it was frustrating. He felt as if Abby had been tricked, deceived in some way. And like a good husband, he felt the urge to rescue her. To get her out of the situation that was changing her. 

 Nathan wanted to know the truth. He wanted to find out about this Nina woman. He wanted to meet her, and find out what she had done to get Abby on her side. He wanted find out what it was about Nina that made Abby so subservient to her whims. From all the stories he had heard, Nina was a horrible person. And suddenly, Abby was on her side. Nathan had to find out what the deal was. 

 Nathan considered the fact that maybe he was over thinking things, and that maybe Abby had just grown to respect her naturally. But, something just seemed off about what happened. Nathan knew he couldn't go into her office yelling and screaming. He didn't want to risk Abby's job, especially if he was wrong. He knew he had to go in their civil, but focused. He needed to find out what this Nina was made of. 

 ********** 

 Nina was in a bad mood, for a few reasons. She had just sent Abby out to pick up lunch and Abby was taking her time. But Nina's most pressing issue was the fact that she was horny as hell. With Paris and the divorce, it had been weeks since she had gotten laid. Today was the day Nina would normally have Alberto visit for her massage, but Alberto had gotten cold feet and didn't want to meet anymore. Nina looked over at her personal massage table, folded up in the corner. She had purchased it, not wanting to share the same table as Alberto's regular customers. Nina was hardly able to focus. Her body demanded satisfaction. 

 If she was less distracted she would have heard the conversation going on outside the room. Audrey looked up and saw a handsome man walk in. Audrey couldn't help but look him over. He was fit, he was hot, and if her first glance was correct, he was packing. Audrey couldn't help but turn on the charm. 

 

 "Can I help you?" she asked, looking upward, exposing her neck to him. He looked nervous. As he looked around, Audrey took the opportunity to unbutton the top button of her blouse, revealing a glimpse of her juicy cleavage. For years, Audrey had prided herself on having the best pair of breasts in whatever room she was in. Nice, firm DD's, which always made other girls green with envy. But then, she started working with Nina, and her gigantic breasts, and Audrey realized that her breasts could in fact be beaten. But Audrey was happy to know it took a rare woman like Nina to be her superior. 

 "My name is Nathan. I'm Abby's husband." Nathan said. Audrey's expression dropped a little, but not too much. A wedding ring was just a ring to her. Besides, she saw Nathan take a quick glance at her exposed cleavage. She knew that wasn't a sight he would see with Abby and her itty, bitty titties. 

 Audrey was happy to know that even though Abby was starting to become her superior professionally, Audrey was and would always be Abby's superior as a woman. And Audrey knew that would take her farther in life than Abby would ever get. She was happy to let Abby slave away at work, desperate for Nina's approval. That took the heat off of Audrey, and allowed her to get laid on a regular basis. It made Audrey laugh to think that all of Abby's hard work allowed Audrey to get fucked as many times as she wanted. 

 "Abby's not here right now. Maybe there's something I can help you with?" Audrey said, hoping he would pick up the signals she was giving off. 

 "Actually, I came to see Nina. I want to meet her." Nathan said. 

 "Oh." Audrey replied. "She's in right now. Go right in." Audrey said. As Nathan walked passed her, Audrey smirked. She knew the score. She had seen dozens of young men like Nathan walk into Nina's office, and they all walked out the same way: sweaty, exhausted, with the full load they had been storing in their balls gone. Audrey knew what type of woman Nina was. She knew because she was the same type of woman. Nina was a voracious devourer of men. Abby had been too naïve to figure it out, but Audrey was not. Sluts can sniff out other sluts easily, and Audrey knew that Nina was a Queen slut. That was why Audrey deferred to Nina. Audrey knew it was inevitable. Audrey knew that men responded to Nina, and it was something she had studied to improve her own skills. Audrey had picked up a few tricks but she was well aware that Nina was her superior. She had gotten a few of Nina's sloppy seconds and she had had her success on her own. 

 So Audrey was well aware what would happen when a handsome young man walked into Nina's office. Nathan was walking into a lion's den. He was walking in Abby's husband, but he would walk out with loyalty to a different woman. And to a slut like Audrey, that thought violently turned her on. She could only sit back and watch it happen. 

 Nathan walked into the office. He looked over at the desk and saw an older, silver-haired woman there. She didn't notice him, so Nathan tried to figure out what to do. Before he could decide, Nina looked up at him. 

 "Who are you?" Nina asked softly. Nathan looked into her eyes. He was struck by how intense her stare was. It appeared as if she was staring into his soul. 

 "I'm Nathan. I'm Abby's husband." Nathan replied, more nervous than he had anticipated. He couldn't take his eyes off of her. Despite the fact that she was older, she was strikingly beautiful. For an older lady, she looked great. 

 Nina looked at him. She had to be impressed by Abby, for snatching up such a young hunk. She noticed Nathan staring her, transfixed by her beautiful face. She was used to it. She knew the effect she had on young men. Then, it all clicked into place for Nina. Her cold, calculating mind easily put all the pieces into place, and she devised a plan so devious that she couldn't believe she hadn't considered it before. She had considered Abby a worthy challenger. She had to, since Abby weathered the storm and survived the Nina Baxter experience, a feat very few have done. She had considered Abby one of the few people who was unbeatable. Abby had taken all of Nina's best shots and had made it through. Nina respected that. Nina respected her. But now Nina realized that Abby was not unbeatable. Nina realized she had one more play to make. One last move. A move so devious, so evil, but so fucking hot. Nina knew that if this plan would work, she wouldn't just defeat Abby, she would destroy her. She would fucking destroy her. 

 Nina was a cold, devious woman. She was an egomaniac. She had thought that Abby was unbeatable, and she thought that she could drop her cold veneer and possibly make a great friend. But now, things had changed. She just knew this plan would work. Miss unbeatable Abby wasn't so unbeatable after all. And with that thought, Nina's respect level for Abby dropped to nothing. 

 Nina was justifying to herself why she should do this. Abby had been the best worker she had ever had. She was a bright, happy, ambitious woman who could go places. She had done everything Nina asked. She had made Nina's life easier. She had saved Nina's job. She had gotten Nina through her divorce. But the thought of destroying her anyway was too fucking hot. Showing that young girl that it was futile to try to win Nina over, because Nina would betray her anyway. 

 To Nina, the thought was irresistible. The pleasant side of her that had been awakened by this idea of hers was being stamped away by her true nature. Her ego would not allow her to admit defeat. Any sympathy she might have shown for Abby was being driven by her evil, sex-crazed mind. 

 Nina was a slut. Always had been. Always would be. She hadn't had sex in over two weeks. Two weeks! Her body demanded satisfaction. She was desperately in need of a young man to take care of all those needs. A young man like Nathan. Nina knew what needed to happen. Nina had to fuck Nathan. 

 Nina had been looking for a handsome, strong, yet reluctant man to fuck her for some time now. A man who was dying to fuck her, but knew he shouldn't. A man who, for whatever reason, had a reason not to fuck her. Nina had never considered going after a married man. That right there would provide a built-in reluctance to fuck her. A man fighting the urge to cheat when confronted with a woman built for sex was the ideal for Nina. A man driven over the edge of sanity until all he cared about was sex. Being so sexy that a man couldn't fight the urge to fuck when confronted with her hot body. And Nathan was about to be confronted with her hot body. The added taboo of fucking her subordinate's hunky husband only made it hotter. 

 Nina could tell he was under her spell already by the way he looked at her. She knew why he was here. He wanted to bitch her out and curse at her. He was wondering why Abby had become so concerned with Nina 24/7. He wanted to know why Abby had become so submissive to her whims. Well, he was about to find out how easy it was to become submissive to her. 

 All of these thoughts passed through Nina's head in a matter of moments. Nathan was still looking at her, transfixed. But he was just seeing her face. She knew he had to get a better look at what she had to offer before making his choice. 

 "Shut the door." Nina said sternly. Nathan, not wanting to be impolite, turned and closed the door. This disappointed Audrey who was watching from outside. As the door shut, her eyes met Nina's. Nina looked at her and smirked slightly. That was the last thing Audrey saw before the door shut. Audrey knew her earlier suspicions were confirmed. Nathan's days as a loving, loyal husband were done. He was trapped alone with a lioness who wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. 

 Nathan didn't know why he had been so stunned when he first saw Nina. He wasn't sure what it was about her. Then, he turned around. 

 Nina had stood up and was now standing before him. For the first time, Nathan was able to take in the complete package. Nina was standing there wearing a blood-red dress that molded to her body. To say that the dress was flattering to her was an understatement. He was shocked to realize that Nina, this supposed "old lady", had a hot fucking body. This just didn't make any sense to him. He had never had a second thought about older women. He knew some guys were into that, but not him. Older ladies weren't his thing. But this woman was something else. There was something about her that prevented him from taking his eyes off of her. It could have been the two massive EE-cup breasts stretching the tight dress to the breaking point. It could have been the cavern of milky, creamy cleavage that the low cut dress exposed. It could have been her firm stomach, which the dress hugged snugly. It could have the fact that, at the angle she was standing at, he could glimpse the way it molded around her ass from the side, and he could immediately tell that she had a butt most girls would kill for. It could have been her long legs, the tight dress clinging to them until her creamy legs emerged, firm and long. His eyes traveled down to her feet, which were encased in matching, blood-red high heels. These all were things that Nathan would never admit to enjoying. All he knew now was that he was transfixed. 

 He was shocked that all of these perfect body parts were on this "old lady". How could an old lady be so fit, so in-shape, yet so voluptuous? The contrast of these perfect features with her silvery-white hair just seemed so wrong, yet so right. Nathan shook his head, clearing his thoughts. 

 "Can I help you, Nathan?" Nina asked. Nathan steeled himself, knowing what he needed to do. 

 "I, um... I wanted to meet you. Abby has said so much about you. I wanted to meet you myself." Nathan said, nervously. He couldn't understand why he was so nervous around this woman. Nina looked at him and her lips curled up into a look of almost disgust. 

 "Nathan, I demand one thing of all the people around me, and that is complete honesty. I know why you are here. If you are not completely honest with me and you do not get to the real reason you are here, I will have you removed from the building... and I will fire your wife. Now tell me, why are you here?" Nina demanded.  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© Nathan was flabbergasted. This woman was threatening to fire Abby! This was not going at all like he hoped. He looked at Nina. She looked at him expectantly. She was demanding an answer. He knew what he wanted to say, but could he do it? Could he say the nasty things he wanted to say to her? She looked like him as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. To hell with it, he thought. 

 "I want to know how you did it. I know what you did to Abby here. I know all the horrible things you put my wife through. I know how much of a bitch you were to her! But what I don't know is how you got her on your side. How did you, all of a sudden, get her to be loyal to you? How did you get it so she did your bidding 24/7? What did you do? How did you trick her into being loyal to you? Did you blackmail her? How did you get her under your spell?" Nathan said, becoming more confident and angrier as he spoke. 

 Nina did not seem affected by this at all. She was completely non-pulsed. She just smiled slightly. 

 "Very good. I'm glad you're being honest with me. I can give a very simple answer to you that will explain everything." Nina started, beginning to circle him. "There are two types of people. There is the type of person that goes through life, getting what they want. They get what they want easily because fate helps them. Fate helps them get whatever the hell they want. I am one of those types of people. Then there is the other type. They are the type who hates the first type. They work hard, be nice, and all that other bullshit. They hate everything about us. But deep down, they dream about being one of us. They wish they were one of us. They don't know it, but everything they do is for the sole purpose of making our lives better. Abby is of that type. She is the type of girl whose sole purpose in life is to help women like me live better lives. Girls like her can never become like me. They will go through hell, while women like me keep our hands clean. They do all the work. We live better lives." 

 Nathan was stunned into silence. Nina continued, hammering her point home. 

 "Women like her, of her type, will work hard, futilely, hoping to become a woman like me. But they don't know that they can never become one of us. Women like her are sad... pathetic... submissive." Nina said, her breathy voice husky. "The only people of her type that can move up in the world are men like you." 

 "What?" he said, still taken aback. 

 "You are of the same type as her. You act strong, like a big, tough man. But in the end, you are hopelessly submissive. You came in here ready to cuss me out and stand up for your woman. But then you met me, and you did what all people of your type do. You defaulted into your true nature. You defaulted into servitude. You defaulted into complete submissiveness. You came in here ready to fight, but now, you want to do whatever I want. You want to do what I tell you to." Nina said. Nathan stepped back. 

 "That's not true. Fuck you, bitch!" Nathan said, terrified. Nina just shook her head. 

 "It always goes like this. When I expose a person's true feelings, they always lash out. They always rebel. They are fighting the truth. They always deny the simple, obvious, undeniable truth." Nina said, circling her prey. 

 "I'm not like that. I'm not submissive." Nathan said, shocked by this turn of events. 

 "Your wife is up for a promotion, you know." Nina started walking towards her desk. "Your wife has worked hard, and has earned a promotion. I'll make you a deal. If you come over here and rub my shoulders, we can discuss whether your wife deserves her promotion. If you properly convince me, your wife will get her promotion." Nina said, sitting down. 

 "Screw you. I'm not touching you!" Nathan said, scared of this evil, evil woman. 

 "Don't you realize, Nathan, that your wife's future is in your hands. If you don't come over here and rub my shoulders, your wife's career will be done for. Feel free to argue your point. Attempt to convince me I'm wrong. Feel free to yell and scream at me about how I've made your wife's life hell. Rub my shoulders and tell me about all the bad things I did." Nina said, sitting up straight in her chair, exposing her neck for an imminent rubdown. 

 Nathan was confused. How did he go from wanting to yell and scream at this woman and defend his wife's honor, to being blackmailed to rub this bitch's shoulders. He didn't see any other option. If he didn't do what she asked she would tank Abby's career. He couldn't let that happen. 

 Nathan's legs felt heavy as he slowly walked behind Nina. Nina had gotten back to work, scribbling notes on a piece of paper. She didn't even look up at him. Nathan stopped behind her. He looked down at her exposed neck and the exposed flesh of her shoulders. He looked at her smooth creamy skin, and he couldn't help but wonder how soft her flesh was. His hands shook as he reached towards her shoulders. 

 As Nathan's fingers pressed against the creamy skin of Nina's shoulders, Nina's head rose from looking at her papers. She dropped her pen onto the desk as Nathan, against his will, began to rub her shoulders. Nina bit her lip as she tried to stifle a moan. Her nipples hardened under her dress. 

 Nathan was the type of guy who was good at whatever he did. He would give his best effort at whatever he was working on. That was why, despite his reluctance, he couldn't help but give this woman a great neck rub. 

 "Go ahead, honey. Bitch at me. Defend your wife. Convince me your wife deserves to be like me." Nina said. 

 "You're evil, you know that?" Nathan said, insulting this woman while simultaneously rubbing her shoulders. "You've made my wife's life hell. You've caused her life so much trouble that you've actually caused me and her to fight. You have caused a rift in our marriage!" Instead of the regret he hoped to cause in her, he only made this bitch moan. 

 "That turns you on? You're sick!" Nathan said, rubbing her neck harder. Part of him wanting to hurt her for the pain she's caused both him and Abby. This only caused her to moan more. 

 "I might have to hire you. My masseuse flaked out on me. You're good at this. I might hire you full time to give me rubdowns." Nina said. 

 "Not bloody likely." Nathan replied, still rubbing her shoulders. 

 "You will soon understand how hot it is to me that I have caused a rift in your marriage. Without even meeting you, I have caused problems in your marriage. I have dominated your wife so thoroughly that it has affected you. I have dominated your wife so thoroughly that it has affected how much you two have sex." 

 "What!? How could you possibly know that?" Nathan asked, still rubbing her aching neck. 

 "With the hours she's been working, no doubt you have sex as often as you used to. You've told yourself you don't have sex with her because of those busy hours, but I know the truth. I know that the reason you don't have sex with her is because, quite simply, you are not attracted to her anymore." 

 This caused Nathan to pull his hands from her. 

 "You don't know anything about me!" he replied angrily. 

 "I know that men are not attracted to weak women, and that wife of yours, she is as weak as they come. She was strong once, until she met me. A real woman. A strong woman. And she cowered like the weak little girl she is. Seeing that must have been tough. It must have been tough to realize that your wife is a pathetic, weak-minded fool. It must have hurt to fall out of love with her when you saw how I had completely destroyed her. You knew at that moment that you had to meet the woman who destroyed her so thoroughly, because you knew that the woman was a strong woman. A real woman. A woman that deserves to have a man like you." Nina said standing up. 

 "I'm leaving." Nathan said, walking to the door. 

 "Remember, your wife's future rests in my hands." Nina said. 

 "I don't care. I don't want her working for a crazy bitch like you." Nathan replied, his hand on the doorknob. 

 "Don't forget, she's loyal to me now. Do you think she will understand when she finds out you stormed in here, ranting at me like a madman? Do you think she'll be happy about this? She will blame you for costing her this job. If you walk out that door, your marriage is over." Nina threatened. This stopped Nathan. He realized Nina was right. If Abby lost her job, the job she had worked long and hard for, she would hate him forever. Nathan's hand dropped from the doorknob. 

 "Good. Because this massage needs to go to the next level." Nina said, started to unbutton the front of her dress. 

 "What are you doing?" Nathan asked. 

 "When I get a full body massage, I don't leave anything on between the masseuse's hands and my body." Nina said. Nathan couldn't help but watch as more of her creamy flesh was revealed. Nina noticed him staring at her. 

 "The table's over there. The oils are next to it. Get it set up." Nina ordered sternly, as if he should have known to do that rather than gawk at her body. He pulled his eyes away from her and walked over to the table. He grabbed it and the basket of massage oils. He was afraid to look at Nina, terrified of the visual treats she would no doubt be offering. Keeping his head down, he found an open area in the office, unfolded the table, and set the basket of oils nearby. He knew he had nothing else to distract him. He lifted his head and looked at Nina. And once he did, he could not look away. Because the moment that Nathan looked at her was the moment her dress hit the floor. 

 Nathan's eyes started at her bare feet and made their way up. He looked up her long, firm legs. His eyes stopped for a moment as he reached her panties. Her skimpy panties. Her skimpy, lacy black panties, which could very possibly be a thong. Nathan was a fan of thongs. He had always hinted at Abby to start wearing thongs. But she found them uncomfortable, so unfortunately, Nathan didn't have many opportunities to see a thong-clad butt. And if Nina turned around, he might get the opportunity. 

 His eyes moved onward, across her surprisingly firm, fit stomach, a stomach most women her age would kill for. Nathan's eyes bugged out as he reached the next landmark on her body. Two big, massive landmarks. 

 Nathan had never seen tits that big. Ever. They definitely appeared to be real, judging by how round and smooth they looked. There seemed to have very little sag. They looked impossibly firm. Maybe she had them lifted so they rode high on her chest. But all that mattered was that she had huge, firm breasts. And they poured over the top of her bra in just the right way. Nathan could easily see an outline of her nipples under the black lace. Nathan glanced at her cleavage and marveled at the way Nina's big breasts pressed against each other, creating a deep cavern of cleavage. 

 Nathan was finally able to look away from Nina's chest. He looked to her face and saw her give him a smug look, as if she knew he liked what he saw. Nathan was again shocked by the contrasts he saw with her. Just by looking at her face, you would think she was older. Not that her face looked old. Her face was actually quite gorgeous. But she wouldn't be mistaken for a young woman. Her face was clearly one of a gorgeous, mature woman, that when combined with her silver hair, would make one think she was older, maybe in her fifties. But then, glancing at her body, her body was aged to perfection. She was old enough to have filled out perfectly, but not old enough to have started falling apart. Looking at her body after looking at her face made Nathan realize she was probably younger than he originally thought. 

 Nina gave him an almost defiant look, daring him to look away, daring him to look away from her body. She looked away from him as she turned around. And as she did, she confirmed Nathan's earlier suspicion: Nina was wearing a thong. And the thong allowed him to confirm another earlier suspicion: Nina had a great ass. Her firm, round ass-cheeks were exposed to her assistant's husband. The thong highlighted those perfect cheeks like they deserved to be. Her ass was meant to be showed off. The triangle where the string that ran between her ass-cheeks met the two straps that ran around her hips was not a solid piece of cloth but was instead made up of three strings, two strings forming the sides of the triangle and another going straight up, all three strings meeting the main strap of the thong. It was a thong that a younger girl would wear, but required an older woman to truly highlight. Nathan didn't get to be transfixed by her thong for too long, as Nina slipped her fingers under the straps of the thong and pulled it down, letting it drop to the floor. 

 Nathan had an unencumbered view of his wife's boss's bare ass. It was a view that any husband whose wife's boss had so thoroughly dominated his wife deserved to see. If a woman dominated one of her subordinates so thoroughly, she deserved to show her bare ass to that subordinate's husband. It was a fact of life. If a woman had dominated a woman so much in the workplace, she deserved to dominate her personal life as well. And she was about to. Nina was about to take over Abby's sex life. Since Nina had dominated Abby so well, she felt like she had the right to make all of the decisions in Abby and Nathan's sex life. And like the cold businesswoman she was, she had to make the tough decisions. But the decision she had to make wasn't tough at all. It was quite simple. Abby and Nathan's sex life wasn't working. Abby was an inferior woman married to a superior hunk of man. To Nina, that was unacceptable. It was her duty to step in and make sure that this did not continue any longer. It was her right to step in and do what had to be done. It was Nina's duty to fire Abby from her own sex life. Her work thus far had been unacceptable. If she had done her job, her husband wouldn't be here, gagging to be stolen from her. So Nina had to fire Abby from her own sex life and replace her with the most qualified candidate. That was herself. Nina knew the best decision moving forward was to take Abby's place in her sex life and in her marriage. She was about to be replaced. For Nathan's sex life, Abby's services were no longer required. 

 After letting her thong drop to the floor, Nina straightened up. She reached back and unclipped her bra. The back of her bra separated, revealing her sexy, bare back. Nina let the bra slip off her shoulders, joining her thong on the floor. Nathan looked at the nude form of Nina from the back. Her tits were so big he could see the sides of them from behind her. Nina started to turn around, and Nathan braced himself for seeing the total package of Nina nude, finally. But as she did, she brought her hands in front of herself. She used one arm to cover both of her breasts, at least the she tried to. There was so much flesh there that they were bulging around her arms. The only things he couldn't see were her nipples. Nina had used her other hand to reach down and cover her pussy, preventing Nathan from seeing it. 

 "Turn around, honey. You don't get to see the goods unless you earn it." Nina said. He couldn't help but obey. He turned around for a few moments, and only turned around once Nina told him too. She had taken her place on the massage table, face down. Her tits were ballooning outward, and her ass again was bared to his eyes. He had no choice but to walk over and get a better look. 

 He stood over Nina's body, begging to be massaged. He looked down at her exposed flesh. Her skin looked so smooth and well cared for. Skin that was dying to be touched. Nina was looking straight down through the hole in the table. She was silent, knowing the allure of her body would be enough to draw his hands to her flesh. 

 Nathan didn't know how he had gone from wanting to scream at this bitch to be poised to give her a full-body massage. He wanted to stay loyal to his wife, but he was in a lose-lose situation. He either puts his hands on the hot body of his wife's boss, or his wife gets fired. He had to touch her. He had to put his hands on Nina's flesh. 

 Backed into a corner, he had no choice but to reach over, grab a bottle of oil, open it, and pour warm, smooth oil along Nina's spine. He poured an almost excessive amount of oil along her back, not sure how much was the proper amount. He set the bottle back in its place. He placed his trembling hands into the puddle of oil on her back. Nervously, he started to spread the oil around her back. He couldn't help but notice that how smooth her skin was. He had never felt smoother skin. It felt so soft. 

 His hands were soon slick with oil, and her back was covered with a sheen of oil. He spread the oil across her shoulders, neck, and arms. He gathered some oil in his hands and spread the oil across both of her legs. The only part of her body not covered with oil was her ass. He was afraid to touch her ass, for a few reasons. One, he didn't know if he had permission. Two, if he put his hands on Nina's hot, ten out of ten ass, he didn't know if he would be able to take his hands off. 

 With the oil spread, he had no choice but to begin the rubdown in earnest. He started at her feet, spreading the oil around her feet. He rubbed each toe individually, taking his time. He rubbed the sole of each of her aching feet, rubbing all the tension away. He rubbed her heels before progressing up her legs, one at a time, taking his time, rubbing each muscle firmly. He got nervous as he got closer to her ass. Nathan was terrified of Nina's ass. He also couldn't help but notice that he could catch a glimpse of her pussy if he looked between her legs. He tried not to look, but for some reason, he couldn't help himself. To pull himself away from this temptation, he skipped her ass and moved to her back. 

 He rubbed the muscles around her spine, starting at the small of her back and moving upward. 

 "Harder." Nina uttered. Nathan looked down at Nina with disgust as he complied. 

 "Harder!" Nina ordered, his harder rubbing not doing the trick. If Nina wanted it hard, she would get it hard. Nathan started to rub and knead her back as hard as he could. 

 "Oh, fuck!" Nina moaned out, Nathan's hard rubbing only turning her on. Nathan continues to rub her back for the next few minutes, carefully avoiding the sides of her breasts, before moving up to her neck and shoulders. Since he rubbed her there earlier, he didn't stay there for too long. 

 He moved to her arm and rubbed the firm muscles until all the tension in her arm was gone. He moved to her fingers and one at a time, rubbed each one. He repeated the process on her other arm. He lifted his hands off of her, unsure of what to do next. 

 "You missed a spot," Nina said. There was only one dry spot he could see, and it was her ass. Nina clearly wanted her ass massaged. Nathan thought about what he was doing. He was being told to massage his wife's boss's ass. The same boss who had made her wife's life hell for months. He didn't want to do it. He hated this woman, and hated how she had affected his marriage. But he had no choice. He looked at the small of her back and noticed that some oil had pooled there. Oil that was destined to end up spread across the ass, as if it was its sole purpose to do so. It was at that point that Nathan put his hands on Nina's ass. 

 

 He gathered oil from her back and spread to her ass, painting her ass cheeks with the smooth substance. He lightly spread the oil until he had no choice to give her ass-cheeks a healthy squeeze. He couldn't contain the groan that escaped his mouth. Her ass felt so good. It was perfectly round and firm in just the right way. The flesh poured through his fingers, rebounding against his touch. He looked up at Nina, and he saw her bite her lip. 

 Nathan worked her ass over, starting at the top and working his way down. He knew she liked hard massages, so he rubbed and squeezed her ass hard.  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© "Deeper, honey." Nina commanded. Nathan had hesitated to work his hands into her ass-crack, but she clearly wanted it. His hands slowly made the way towards the cavern between her butt-cheeks. He gingerly worked his fingers into her ass-crack, afraid to get too deep. This continued for a few minutes until Nina got impatient. 

 "I said deeper!" Nina growled. "Don't be afraid of it." 

 Nathan looked up at Nina, annoyed by her constant demands. He reached down and used one hand to pull her ass-cheek to the side. With his other hand, he reached down, running his fingers deeper into her ass-crack. Nathan couldn't help but notice her asshole, just right there in front of him. He was terrified to get close to it but as he looked down, he realized her asshole looked quite clean. This knowledge made it a little easier to work his fingers into her crevice, touching every part of her ass except for her asshole. Nina leaned her head up, looking back at him. 

 "I said deeper!" Nina growled again. Nathan was shocked. Nina was basically commanding him to massage her asshole! This was ridiculous. But it was right there, and it looked clean. There was no reason not to. So Nathan took two fingers and rubbed them across her asshole. 

 "There you go sweetie." Nina said, resting her head back down. Nathan, now freed of his fear, was free to massage her ass however he wanted to. He had no fear in reaching deep into her ass-crack, and he felt no shame when he felt his fingers rub against her asshole. Nathan was no longer afraid of touching his wife's boss's asshole. 

 This continued for a few minutes before Nina spoke up. 

 "Take off your clothes and I'll turn over." Nina said simply. 

 "What?" Nathan asked, confused, as he took his oily hands off of her. 

 "I said take off your clothes!" Nina commanded. 

 "I can't do that." Nathan replied. 

 "You think you get to see the goods without giving up something in return?" Nina said skeptically. Nathan was still taken aback. Nina continued. "What kind of massage do you think this is? Every male masseuse knows what they are getting into with me. They don't fight it when I'll tell them to take off their clothes. Now... be a man and take off your clothes! It's that or your wife's career is over." 

 Nathan was stunned into silence. He didn't know what to do. His wife's career could be over if he didn't obey Nina. He felt like he was backed into a corner and there was only one way out. Nathan reached down and grabbed his shirt, lifting it over his head. 

 Nina had her hand under her chin as she watched him strip. She gave a slight nod as he exposed his abs to her. He nervously glanced at Nina before reaching down and unbuckling his belt-buckle. As he handled his clothes, he didn't realize that the oil from his hands were smearing onto his clothing, permanently staining them. They would never be the same. 

 Nathan unbuckled his belt, unzipped his jeans and let them drop to the floor. For the first time, Nathan realized his dick was absolutely throbbing. His cock was incredibly hard. His dick was so hard that he felt like the slightest stimulation could set him off. He looked down to see his hefty ten-inches stretching his boxer-briefs. He looked over at Nina. Nina's eyes were on his cock, checking it out, waiting for it to be released. She looked up into his eyes slowly, waiting for the inevitable. Daring him to do it. Daring him to show her his cock. 

 Nathan again wondered how he got here. He came here to yell at this bitch for her evil, manipulative ways. Now, he was being forced to show her his cock. He just couldn't understand how he got into this situation. Nathan's eyes met hers as his thumbs slipped under the waistband of his boxer-briefs and started slipping them off. 

 Nathan felt his briefs puddle around his ankles and he could feel the air against his dick. He was still looking into Nina's eyes, and she was looking into his. She was in no rush to see his cock. She was taking her time. Finally, she lazily pulled her eyes from his, and glanced down at his dick, standing proud, exposed to her eyes, finally. She smiled slightly and nodded, not only due to the fact that she was quite pleased by the sight of his beefy cock, which she surmised to be about ten-inches. It was dripping pre-cum, violently aroused by the sight of her hot body. He would never admit how turned on he was by her. His dick was all the proof she needed. 

 The other reason she smiled was due to the fact that her hot-body was enough to drive this married man nuts and turn him on so much that he had to show her his dick. This pleased her greatly. She looked back into his eyes and watched his reaction as she turned over, exposing her body to the married man. Unlike Nina, Nathan's eyes immediately began to feast on the naked body now exposed to him, so eager he was to see her flesh bare. 

 Nathan's jaw dropped and his dick jumped reflexively. He watched as she rolled over and finally revealed her massive, creamy boobs to his eyes. He watched as one hard nipple was revealed, followed by the other. Each nipple was rock hard, begging to be sucked on. Begging to be chewed on. He watched as those huge titties bounced around her chest before coming to a stop as she settled on her back. They were every bit as firm as he imagined. And they looked so smooth, the silky roundness of those breasts only interrupted by those hard nipples of hers, pointing skyward. 

 His eyes traveled down her body. Down, her fit, flat stomach. Down to her thin waist, and past her wide hips. His eyes finally settled on her pussy. Her nearly-bare pussy, with only a tuft of hair above it, forming a landing strip. The carpet matched the drapes, as the hair above her pussy was the same silver color. 

 Nathan pulled his eyes away from her pussy and looked into her eyes. He saw that smug smirk on her face again. Part of him couldn't help but understand her smugness. This woman at least double his age was arrogantly showing off her naked body to him, a body which was superior to any body he had ever seen. It would be hard not to be arrogant with a body like that. 

 Nina wiggled her finger at him, indicating for him to move closer. He nervously walked towards her, approaching her body, her body looking even better as he got nearer. 

 "Finish me off... Don't touch these." she said, pointing at her tits, "Or this." She added, pointing at her pussy, "Unless you are willing to accept the consequences." Nina knew the best way to get someone to want to do something was to tell them not to. He would fight it, but the temptation her massive breasts provided him would be too strong, and he would be unable to resist the urge to squeeze and suck her massive titties. 

 Nathan nodded, not taking his eyes off her tits. He grabbed the massage oil and drizzled some more on her stomach. He pooled the oil in his hands and spread it to her legs, massaging the front of her legs, covering them in oil. As he worked up to her hips, he couldn't help but stare at her pussy. It looked so pretty and well cared for. It looked like the pussy of a young woman, except for the silver hair. 

 Nathan felt his hard dick nudge the table. He didn't know why he was so hard. This woman was a bitch, and she was kind of an old lady. But her body was so perfect. That must be it. Her perfect body was making him hard. That's all. It wasn't her dominant nature. It wasn't the fact that she dominated his wife. It was just her hot body. At least that's what he told himself. 

 Nathan progressed to her stomach, spreading the oil around while rubbing her. He avoided the area around her pussy, leaving it dry. He also avoided getting close to her tits, but they were so big they were hard to avoid. 

 "It must be hard." Nina started, looking up at him. "It must be hard to not touch me where you really want to. Trust me, they are worth it." she said, guiding his eyes back to her tits. "They are so soft. They are so firm. They are hard to resist. But don't you dare touch them! If you love your wife, you'd better not touch them. If you fucking touch these, you're life will never be the same. Don't fucking squeeze my massive titties unless you're man enough to handle what would happen next." 

 Nathan spread the oil across her belly, and without realizing it, his hands were getting slightly closer to those tits of hers. 

 "And don't you dare get any oil anywhere near my cunt!" Nina ordered. "If you are gonna put moisture on my cunt, I don't want it from the oil. I want it from your tongue." she added, making her intentions clear. Part of Nathan knew, but he fought the truth. He fought against the knowledge that there was a possibility that Nina wanted to have sex with him. He couldn't believe it. How could this woman want to have sex with him? She knew he was married. It was totally out of the question. But here she was, practically daring him to fuck her. 

 "I'm married." Nathan muttered, his fingers unconsciously getting closer to her chest. 

 "Doesn't matter." Nina said simply. "I know your wife. I've seen what kind of woman she is. She does not measure up to a woman like me. You know that, and I know that. She is not enough of a woman where it counts. You've always known that, and it took a real woman like me to make you realize that." 

 Nathan was terrified of this woman. She was evil. But he didn't realize that the sides of his fingers were grazing the bottoms of her breasts. He had to somehow get out of this predicament. 

 "But... you're old." Nathan said, trying to piss her off. Nina just smiled. 

 "This old lady is more of a woman than your wife will ever be. Your wife will never have tits this big. She will never have an ass this round. She will never have a pussy this tight. She is not enough of a woman to rule your life the way you crave." Nina said. Nathan was silent. 

 "I can tell you why your marriage is in trouble. It's not the long hours she was working. The fact is, the minute your wife came home and started bitching about me, you stopped being attracted to her. You realized your wife was a poor excuse of a woman. Any woman who could so easily be worn down and defeated is not a woman worth being married to. It was at that moment that you fell in love with me. You never even met me and you were head over heels." Nina said. 

 "That's ridiculous!" Nathan said, his fingers still grazing Nina's breasts. 

 "That's why you came here, wasn't it? To fuck me. To give me a good fuck in appreciation for having to put up with your pathetic wife. The minute you stepped into my office your marriage was over. There was no way a hot young stud like you was walking into the office of a woman like me without getting fucked. You did not hesitate to rub my shoulders, take off your clothes, and give me a full-body massage. You did not hesitate to show me your cock, because you knew I deserved to see it." Nina said. 

 "That's not true. I love my wife." Nathan pleaded, still rubbing her. 

 "Not anymore. You can't take your hands off of me. You know now that your wife doesn't belong here. She knows nothing about style and fashion. You know more about style than she ever will. You know that style is more than just clothing. Style is a thing few women are capable of. Style is a way of life. Style is about attitude. Style is about sexiness. Style is about big tits in tight clothes. Style is about showing off cleavage. Style is about knowing how well tight clothes show off your ass. Style is about lingerie, skimpy bras and thongs. These are things that girl you're married to is not capable of." Nina said. Nathan shook his head. 

 "Look at yourself." Nina said. Nathan looked down and realized the backs of his fingers were pressed against the soft flesh of Nina's breast. "You're gagging for it. All you have to do is take it. Take what you want. Take what you've always wanted." 

 Nathan didn't know why his hands were still on her. He loved his wife, but did Nina make some good points? Nathan didn't enjoy seeing his wife so beaten down. It was not attractive, to be honest. Abby had been beaten down so much that she didn't fight back. She was beaten to the point where she now lived to serve the woman she used to hate. When he married her, the thing he loved most about her was her spunk and her independence. He loved her fight, but thanks to this bitch Nina, all the fight had been taken out of her. Abby didn't have as much fight as he thought. If she was so easily defeated, then she wasn't the woman he thought she was. 

 Nina was a woman who had fight. She was a woman who would not be beaten. She was a woman who lived to run things. She lived to dominate. If he loved fight and independence in a woman, shouldn't he be more attracted to Nina? Did he like those traits because he loved a woman with strong opinions? A strong woman? A dominant woman? A woman who ran things? Was he looking for a woman to dominate his life? 

 Nina saw his hesitation, so she continued. 

 "Look at the evidence. I bet you've never given your wife a rubdown as good as the one you're giving me. I bet you've never given your wife a rubdown period. You have massaged me more in the mere minutes we have known each other than you ever have in the years you've been married to your wife. You want to know why? It's because you want me. Desperately. Your wife's body doesn't compare to mine. You think she impressed anyone around here with that pathetic body of hers? Hardly. You think people saw those tiny titties of hers and thought that she was a girl that was going places? Do you think it is possible that a girl as ugly as her could get anywhere in the fashion industry? She is the type of girl that exists only to make women like me look even better. I am so sexy to you because you are married to her. My hotness is amplified due to your so called love for her. You married a woman who is so ugly, with such a flat ass, and has such small breasts. That's the woman you declared your love for. After being stuck with that for years, you see a woman like me, who is so gorgeous, so much more mature, with such massive breasts, and such a round ass, and you just go wild. You see a woman like me who is more attractive to your wife in every way that matters, and it makes you realize that you are married to a pathetic excuse for a woman. You married a woman who has sad, flat little boobies. A flat, saggy little ass. And quite frankly, a face that is shockingly unattractive. Then you see me. A woman with an absolutely gorgeous face. A woman with a round, perfect ass. A woman with incredible, massive breasts. You glance upon perfection, and you can't look away. You look at perfection, and there is only one thing you can do. You fall in love. Now take it. Take me, and prove your love. Stick that huge fucking dick in my cunt and love me forever." 

 Nathan was in shock listening to the bile she was spewing about Abby. But, he had to admit, there might be some truth there as well. Sure she was old, but her body was so fucking hot. Her age contributed to her sexiness somehow. She was older and she knew what she wanted. She had surely seen it all. He was always into young women and had never considered the option of an older woman. Nina had a hot body, she had a dominant attitude, and she was strikingly gorgeous. She just screamed sex. Was it possible that an older woman was the perfect woman for him? 

 She had blown his defenses away. She had manipulated him into stripping nude, exposing his cock to her, and giving her a rub-down. He had hated this bitch, but she still easily outwitted him. He was a smart guy, so the only way this could have happened was that there was some part of him that wanted it. Some part of him wanted her to dominate him. 

 His fingers were still rubbing against her breast unconsciously. He didn't know why he was still touching her, but then he realized she hadn't given him permission to stop. He didn't want to anger her. Nina spoke up. 

 "Before you decide, know this... If you take this as far as you truly want to, you're making a life-changing decision. If you do this, I'm going to hire you full time. You'll be my full-time assistant. My full-time masseuse. And possibly... my full-time husband." she started. 

 Nina knew this guy was marriage material for her. He had that fight in him that few men she had encountered ever did. He would be fun. 

 "But if you do this, there won't be enough room for both you and Abby. I will have to fire Abby. I will fire her. And she won't be able to get any job worth a damn in this city if I have my way. Your wife will be professionally finished. So... if you want me, if you want 24/7 access to this body... then I want you to beg me to fire your wife. Beg for it, then you will be happier than you ever have been." Nina said. 

 Nathan was shocked. He had to beg Nina to fire his wife. That was the price to get Nina's body. Nathan hated this bitch, and he loved Abby. However, a deep part of him was responding to this woman. This bitch who had made his wife's life hell. But it seemed like it didn't matter. His dick had never been harder. He had never wanted to fuck someone as much as he did right now with Nina. He wanted to fuck Nina as hard as he could and take out all of his hatred of her on her spectacular body. Was it this hatred of her that made him want her more? Did the fact that she had made his wife's life hell turn him on? 

 He wanted to tell her 'no'. He wanted to Nina to go fuck herself. But the fact was, his body wanted this. His dick wanted inside of Nina. He wanted to fuck this bitch and fill her up with cum. He wanted to fill up this "old lady" with his cum. The good, rational part of him wanted to fight for his wife, but then he looked at Nina's bare tits. Her massive, soft titties. Tits so huge that they swept away any remaining loyalty to his wife. He loved his wife, but his instincts were telling him that he wanted Nina. He loved Abby, but he knew deep down he would never be attracted to her again after this. It would be hard to be attracted to her after seeing what Nina had to offer. Nina was superior in every way. 

 "Fire her." Nathan whispered. 

 "Excuse me?" Nina replied. 

 "I said fire her. Fire her! Please fire Abby! Do whatever you have to as long as I can have you." Nathan moaned. 

 "Do it! Be a man and take me!" Nina ordered. At that point, Nathan leaped onto the table between Nina's legs. Knowing he now had permission, he slid his hands upward and finally got two great big handfuls of breast flesh. Nathan couldn't help but groan. They felt so fucking good. He squeezed again and again, the flesh pouring through his fingers. Nathan then cupped both tits, leaned forward, and brought his mouth to her hard nipple. Nathan took one of Nina's nipples into his mouth, sucking on it hard. The nipple felt so good in his mouth that he couldn't help but bite it. His chewed on her nipple, seeing if she would cry out. He looked up with a mouthful of nipple to look in her eyes. Her eyes had a look of amusement. Nathan chewing on her nipple only caused Nina amusement. He kept squeezing and squeezing with his other hand, not getting enough of the sensation of a huge breast in his hand. Nathan quickly changed nipples, slavering Nina's other nipple with his spit. These tits felt so good that he was losing control. The pleasure was too great. 

 Nathan attacked her breasts with his mouth and hands, now in a big-breast induced frenzy. He reached over, grabbed the bottle of oil, and emptied it all over her breasts. Her tits were now absolutely covered with the smooth oil. The oil only made her tits feel better. He couldn't stop squeezing. He couldn't stop sucking. He couldn't resist the urge to stick his face between her breasts and smother himself in their softness. If Nina didn't start pushing on his head with her hands, he could have gotten lost in her tits forever. 

  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© "Put your mouth on my cunt." Nina commanded. With little force, Nina was able to force his head downward. He kissed her smooth stomach, down to her belly button. Then, Nina's pussy was in his face. The area surrounding her pussy was dry, not having been oiled up. Now that Nathan was within a foot of it, he could now tell that her pussy wasn't completely dry. In fact, it was soaking wet. She was dripping wet, clearly turned on. 

 "Do it! It's where your mouth belongs." Nina commanded. Nathan had his doubts. Eating a woman's pussy was such an intimate act. He had only ever gone down on one woman. Abby. He had only given his wife that pleasure. He wasn't sure if he could give that pleasure to another woman. But Nina didn't give him time to decide. She reached down, grabbed his head, and pulled him roughly face-first into her dripping cunt. 

 Nathan tried to fight it. He tried to wrestle his head away, but Nina's grip was too strong. He couldn't fight her off. There was only one way to escape. He opened his mouth and slipped his tongue into Nina's wet, mature pussy. Nathan looked up and saw the smug smirk on Nina's face again as he looked at her face over her mountainous bare breasts. Nathan then closed his eyes, focusing all of his attention on Nina's cunt. 

 As Nathan gathered Nina's juices into his mouth, he had to admit that she tasted great. He could eat her pussy for all three meals a day and it wouldn't bother him. 

 Nathan was soon chin deep in Nina's cunt, furiously eating her hot snatch. All reluctance now gone, his only goal now was to make this fucking evil bitch cum, and show her how much of a man he was. His tongue dug deep into her cunt. He kept doing this until her felt her hard clit rubbing against his nose. He knew he had no choice but to wrap his lips around her clit and suck on it. He knew he had to. He dragged his tongue away, ran it through her silver pussy hair, then went back down and pushed it against her clit before wrapping his lips around it again. 

 "You little fucking shit! You hot fuck!" Nina groaned. Her hips were rolling against his face as he sucked her. Finally, Nathan felt Nina push his head back down. He knew she was about to cum, so he pulled himself from her clit, formed a seal around her cunt with his lips, and gave her pussy a few swipes with his tongue, taking her over the edge. 

 "YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! YOU'RE MAKING ME CUM!" Nina screamed out as a copious amount of her juices shot into his mouth. Nina's thighs were crushing his head, preventing him from removing himself from her cunt. He was forced to swallow all of the juices her pussy provided. Finally, her legs dropped to the table, releasing his head. He pulled his mouth away, breathing deeply, each breath tasting like cunt. 

 "Good boy. You sucked me so well. I suppose you deserve a reward." Nina said, spreading her legs as an invitation. Nathan knew this was the moment of truth. Nina was offering her pussy to him. She was offering sex. Nathan had one last moment of reluctance. 

 "Do it! Be a man and fuck me! Fuck me!" Nina ordered. Nathan looked up at this woman. He hated her. He fucking hated her for making him feel what he did. He hated her, but he wanted her. He wanted to bang this bitch hard. He wanted to fuck her so hard he would fuck the bitch out of her. 

 Nathan crawled over her. His face hovered over hers, and she had that same fucking smirk. Nathan's throbbing dick swayed in the air before coming to a rest against the outside of her pussy, as if it was destined to be there. Nina was looking up at him, daring him to fuck her. Nathan would show this bitch what kind of man he was. He started to push his married cock into this bitch. 

 Nathan was shocked at how much he was struggling to force his dick into this evil slut. He figured since she was older, her pussy would be looser, so it would be an easy trip. But he was wrong. Nina's pussy was tight as hell. It was fighting against this massive intruder. He never had this much trouble getting his dick into his wife. Finally, with a mighty push, her tight pussy spread around the tip of his beefy dick, smothering the tip in its spongy walls. 

 "Oh shit!" Nathan yelled out. He had never felt a hole this tight. 

 "Fuck!" Nina yelled out. She had never felt a dick this big. Now that the tip was in, Nathan was able to force his dick deeper into Nina. As his dick bottomed out in her pussy his balls came to rest against her and Nathan couldn't help but revel in the feeling. Her pussy was so wet and so fucking tight! How was it that this "old lady", who had no doubt fucked lots of men, had such a tight pussy? This bitch's pussy was tighter than Abby's by far! 

 Nina had never been filled up this full. She knew that Nathan was something special. He suited her fetishes perfectly. A young, married man with a huge beefy dick, who was clearly enamored with her, despite his protests. She would never let him go. She met his eyes, communicating the message they both wanted. 

 

 Nathan began to pump his dick into her slowly. They both groaned out loud, absorbed in the pleasure they were sharing. This continued for a few minutes before Nina got impatient. 

 "C'mon! Fuck me harder!" Nina ordered. Nathan increased his pace, but this wasn't enough to satisfy a whore like Nina. 

 "Nathan, I said fuck me! This isn't one of those lame fucks you have with Abby. I want hard fucking. I want real fucking. Now be a man, and fuck the shit out of me!" Nina said. Nathan looked at Nina with hate as he began to pump his hips as hard as he could, driving his dick into her as fast as he could. After a few minutes of this, he looked at her face, hoping to see her moaning in ecstasy. But she looked impatient. He saw her roll her eyes. Bitch! 

 "Fine! I'll show you what I want." Nina said, exasperatedly. Before he could react, Nina rolled over, taking Nathan with her. Now, Nathan was on his back with Nina on top of him. 

 "I'll show you what hard fucking is all about." Nina said. With that, she unleashed the fury. She began to fuck at a furious pace. Nina unleashed her true animal core in a blinding blur of fucking. Nathan thought his fucking had been hard, but this was another level altogether. Nina was fucking in a way that seemed impossible. Nathan didn't know a woman could bounce this fast or fuck this rough. She bounced again and again. Nathan realized she must be in incredible shape to fuck at this pace without stopping. He had never experienced anything like this. All of her weight was coming down on him. He knew his hips would be bruised in the morning. 

 Nathan looked up to see Nina's huge rack bouncing. She had worked up a sweat, and combined with the oil, her body was dripping at a rapid pace. Nathan was now soaked, the fluids from her body having smeared onto him. Nathan reached up and palmed Nina's magnificent tits, squeezing them and playing with her nipples as she rode him. They became too much to handle, so he tried to palm her ass, but that was even tougher to handle as she was still bouncing furiously. He finally had to rest his arms to the side and ride this fuck out. 

 "You never get this from Abby, do you? Abby doesn't fuck you this well, does she? She just whines and moans like a stupid bitch, right? She doesn't fuck you hard and rough like you've always wanted. Like you've always needed. She doesn't have such big, bouncy tits. Seeing such huge tits bouncing is a beautiful sight, isn't it? It's hypnotizing. Something you will never see with flat Abby. And my round, beautiful ass feels so good bouncing against you, doesn't it? Her ass is so weak and pathetic it would break under this kind of force. Not mine. My ass is so perfect and firm that it's enough to break you. My ass is enough to break you down and make you my slave. That's what you want, isn't it. You want to be a slave to me and my body. You want me to fuck you hard until you have no choice but to be my slave so you can fuck me forever." Nina said, fucking Nathan hard. 

 This fuck went on for a few more minutes. Nina sensed the end was near, so she leaned down, wrapped her arms under Nathan, and just used her hips to fuck him into submission. He wrapped his arms around her waist, and for the first time, their lips met. Nathan fiercely kissed Nina, their tongues mashing against each other. 

 Nina was a true master at sex, so she could sense Nathan's impending orgasm. She timed out hers to happen alongside his. 

 "Cum, you fucking asshole! Cum inside me and become my man for life! Cum in me! Betray Abby and abandon her for good. Do it! Cum!" Nina screamed. 

 "Oh, dammit! It feels so fucking good!" Nathan moaned. Nina yelled out, her orgasm hitting her as the first spurt of cum hit the inside of her pussy. Nina ground her hips against him as they rode out their orgasms. She could feel spurt after spurt of hot cum filling her up, deep inside her. 

 Nathan was overcome by pleasure. His balls had never been so full. His dick had never been smothered in a hole this tight. The pleasure was too great too bare. He had never cum this hard. Abby had never made him cum like this. The pleasure he felt at that moment was addicting. It was a feeling he would have to chase. 

 They finally collapsed to the table, both nearly exhausted. Nina's massive breasts were ballooning against his chest, their sweat comingling. 

 "I hope you're not done yet." Nina whispered in his ear. 

 ********** 

 Abby knew Nina was going to be pissed. Traffic had been ridiculously bad. She walked into the office, lunch for both of them in hand, bracing for the worst. 

 As Abby walked by her desk, she saw Audrey, peeking through the closed shades into Nina's office. 

 "What's going on?" Abby asked. Audrey jumped in surprise. 

 "Oh, nothing." Audrey said coyly. 

 "Who's she meeting with?" Abby asked. 

 "Oh, uh, no one. Go right in." Audrey said. As Abby walked by her, Audrey couldn't help but smile. She had just watched the hottest fuck imaginable in Nina's office. And she had been able to listen in, as neither Nina nor Nathan had been particularly quiet. She was extremely hot at the moment, severely turned on by what she had witnessed. The only thing that would make it hotter would be Abby walking in. Audrey turned to watch the show. 

 Abby opened the door. She started to speak as she walked in. 

 "Nina, I am so sorry..." Abby started. Then she saw what was happening in the room. She saw Nina, naked, on all fours on her massage table. Her tits were hanging down like udders and her body was covered with sweat. Behind her was a man, standing at the end of the table, with his face buried in between her ass cheeks, furiously licking Nina's asshole. Nina wasn't paying attention to either Abby or the man. She was simply filing her nails, looking completely relaxed. 

 "Oh, I'm so sorry." Abby said, shielding her eyes. She couldn't help but look again, and she looked at the man buried in her boss's ass. As she looked at him, she realized he had a familiar face. A very familiar face. 

 "Nathan!?" Abby yelled incredulously. She didn't know how to react. Her mind went in a hundred different directions. She couldn't handle it. She blacked out and fell to the floor. None of the three watching particularly cared. Nina set the file down. 

 "Honey, stick your fucking dick in me." Nina whispered to Nathan. He took his mouth off of her delicious asshole and pushed his dick against her asshole. He started to push. This didn't distract Nina. 

 "Audrey!" Nina called out. Audrey stepped over Abby into the room. 

 "Yes, Nina." Audrey said, at the ready. 

 "Get the termination papers ready. Abby won't be here much longer. Call security and have them ready. Once you're done, you can come back and watch." Nina said, her asshole accepting his dick like a champ. 

 "Yes ma'am." Audrey said excitedly. She reluctantly stepped out of the office. 

 "Honey. Fuck me hard. Fuck me like I showed you." Nina said. Nathan grabbed her hips and pulled her to the edge of the table, at the perfect angle for rough sex. Then he started to pump into her furiously, rougher than he ever thought he could. He drove in and out of her, the pleasure of her tight ass feeling incredible. It was the tightest hole he had ever fucked, just ahead of Nina's pussy and way ahead of Abby's pathetic pussy. Nina smiled smugly as Nathan reached under her to cup her tits, using them as handles to drive into her harder, roughly mauling her breasts. She didn't mind. That was just how she liked it. She held off on her orgasm. She wanted Audrey here for that. 

 As if on cue, Audrey walked into the office, shut the door, and sat down. 

 "There you go honey. Let me teach you a few things. Secrets to getting ahead." Nina said. Audrey nodded eagerly. 

 "That bitch on the floor..." Nina started, getting Nathan's attention as he fucked her ass. "That's your wife in a nut shell. A real woman would have come after me kicking and screaming. That bitch collapses to the floor. A woman like me will never end up there, on the floor. Women like me end up here, getting fucked properly. That's what I deserve. That's what any strong woman deserves." Nina said. Nathan nodded, lost in the pleasures her tight asshole provided. 

 "Do it, Nathan. Cum in my ass. Cement your love for me and end your marriage. Do it!" Nina commanded. Nathan couldn't resist. He couldn't tell her 'no'. He buried himself inside her and roared like a lion as he emptied his balls up Nina's ass, his betrayal now complete. 

 ********** 

 Abby was woozy as she woke up. She realized she was in a chair. Suddenly, the memories came flooding back to her. She remembered Nina, and her husband... no, it couldn't be. She looked up, and realized she was not alone. She was sitting in front of Nina's desk, and on the other side was the woman herself. Nina was looking at her, looking at her with pity. 

 "What happened?" Abby said. 

 "You passed out, dear." Nina replied. 

 "It was a nightmare. It couldn't have happened. You didn't do it, did you?" Abby asked, not wanting to confirm her fears. 

 "It's true. Your husband and I have become lovers." Nina replied. 

 "It can't be." Abby said, starting to cry, looking for Nathan. Looking for her husband to make it all better. He wasn't there. 

 "I sent him home. He's picking up his stuff, getting ready to move into my place." Nina replied. 

 "How, how, how could you?" Abby stuttered out. 

 "It was quite easy. Young men seem to fall head over heels for me. Who am I to stop fate?" Nina said. 

 "But, I helped you. With your divorce. And your company." Abby said, crying hard. 

 "That is the difference between you and me. A strong woman would have torn me apart. If I was in your position, I would have destroyed me. I would have torn me down, taken my job, and ruined my life. If you had done that, I would have at least respected you. But, you were weak. You were soft. Men don't like soft women. Men want harsh women, women who will run their lives and dominate them like they need to be. That's why Nathan chose me. That's why he wanted me more than you." 

 "You're evil..." Abby sobbed. 

 "That's why I win." Nina replied. She looked down at her desk. "Pack up your belongings. You are no longer welcome here." she added. 

 "What?" Abby asked. 

 "If you think you're getting the editor job, you're kidding yourself. You are not the woman I thought you were. Audrey will be taking that position." Nina said. 

 "What? She doesn't know anything about journalism." Abby countered. 

 "Yes, but she embodies style in a way you never will. " Nina replied. "She'll get to live the good life, as will Nathan and I. You, I'm afraid, will not." Abby was speechless. 

 "You're fired Abby." Nina said softly. Abby felt like she was going to pass out. Her world was falling apart. 

 "Not only are you fired here, but you will not be able to get a job anywhere in this city worth a damn. The only way you will get anywhere is if you tell me thank you for stealing your husband. If you humble yourself and thank me, and tell me I was right, maybe we can work something out." Nina said. 

 "Fuck you." Abby said. 

 "Nathan took care of that, thank you." Nina said. 

 "I'll never thank you. That's ridiculous." Abby said. 

 "Look at this." Nina said, pointing at her desk. Resting on top was a skimpy black thong. Nina's skimpy black thong. "That thong is just a piece of fabric. An expensive piece of fabric, but just a piece of fabric none the less. But, simply the fact that it has been between my ass-cheeks increases its value ten- fold. That thong is worth more than you simply because it's been between my ass-cheeks. Does it hurt to know that a piece of fabric is more valued in this world than you? I like it more than you. Your husband likes it more than you. Things that go near my ass increase in value. Your husband was just a normal man, but since he's been deep in my ass, his value increased, both to the world and to me. Because he's been in my ass, he will live the good life. So, if you thank me, get on your knees... and give my ass a juicy kiss, I might be able to help you." 

 "Never." Abby said. 

 "Everyone wants to be like me, Abby. Every woman wants to be the one so desired by men. If you could, you would be in my place in a heartbeat. You can only dream of being sexy enough to steal another woman's man. The rush of proving your superiority over another woman is intoxicating." Nina said. 

 "That's insane." Abby said. 

 "Didn't you feel something when you took Audrey's place in Paris? Didn't you feel a rush when you were chosen over her by someone else?" Nina asked. 

 Abby realized that she did feel something when she told Audrey she was going to Paris instead of her. But it wasn't exactly like Nina explained. Right? 

 "So, are you prepared to do what's necessary?" Nina asked. 

 "No. Of course not. Fuck you!" Abby said. 

 "That's unfortunate." Nina said. "When you change your mind, come find me." 

 "It'll never happen." Abby replied. Nina nodded. She started getting back to work. 

 "That's all." Nina said quietly. Abby was about to stand up and wipe that smirk off her face when she realized two security guards had just walked in behind her. She looked back before deciding to give it a shot, jumping towards Nina. The guards grabbed her before she could get anywhere close. Nina didn't bat an eyelash. She didn't even look at her. She didn't need to. The battle was over. Nina had won. 

 Abby started kicking and screaming as she was dragged out of the office. Audrey and her gaggle of friends were laughing at her, and Piers simply shook his head, disappointed. Abby was tossed out into the street, with no job and no man.

 (Six Months Later) 

 Abby was writing in article about the new batch of spark plugs coming out in the next year. After leaving "Style", she had had no luck finding work. She had interviewed all over, but somehow, word got to all of them that she had worked for Nina Baxter. They would seek a reference from her, and they would get one back. Nina's reference for Abby simply stated "She was my biggest disappointment. You would be a fool to hire her." 

 She tried contacting Simon, but he basically just laughed in her face. She had been black-balled out of any job she possibly would have cared about. That was how she found herself working for a car magazine. It wasn't anything she cared about, but it was work. 

 Abby had dwelled on Nathan and Nina after that incident. She wondered how it had happened. Abby realized that she was easily used. She was an easy mark. Simon had used her to make a play for the magazine. Nina had used her to steal her man. Abby vowed never to be used again. 

 As she looked up facts about spark plugs, she thought about how much she hated this job. After awhile she started to consider going to Nina and doing what she said, simply to get better work. But to do so, to thank her for stealing her man, would require her to swallow her pride in a big way.  

 

 ****** The Devil Wears Nada ****** byTheTalkMan© Abby tried to distance herself from the fashion industry in every way. She no longer wore any clothes considered fashionable, settling for bulky clothes, playing down her looks. She didn't want to even be seen as anything close to fashionable. Needless to say, she wasn't turning any heads. 

 She was watching TV in her small apartment when she saw a show about the entertainment industry. She was half watching it, but her attention was grabbed when she saw Nathan on the show. Abby turned up the volume. 

 "After fashion mogul Nina Baxter married her main squeeze, Nathan Baxter, there has been a sharp rise in many noticeable areas. Relationships between women over 40 and men under 25 have increased by over 20%. There has also been a sharp rise in men taking their wife's last name, similar to how Nathan changed his last name to Baxter after the marriage. Also, pregnancies for women over the age of 40 have increased by 30%. All of those things are now fashionable, thanks to Nina Baxter. Rumors have stated that Nina and Nathan have a bun in the oven, but those are just rumors. When we hear more, we will let you know. And I must say, those two are just so cute together. We here wish them all the best." the older female anchor said. Abby turned off the TV, and sat in silence. 

 Abby knew she had to make a choice. Could she keep living this sad life, or could she swallow her pride, talk to Nina, and possibly upgrade her life? 

 The next day, Abby spied on Nina. She watched as Nina left the office. As she walked to her car, she noticed Abby across the street. Nina looked at her and smirked arrogantly. 

 That night, Abby found herself outside Nina's door. She wondered what she was doing, but she knew she couldn't keep living this life she had now. She had no man, no friends, and no future. Ralph and Cori could no longer hang around a sad-sack like her. They had taken Nathan's side in the divorce, understanding why he left Abby. 

 Abby had no choice. She had to do it. Abby knocked on the door. Abby heard rustling, and finally, the door opened. There stood Nina, covered in sweat, wrapped in a golden robe and nothing else. 

 "Abby!" Nina said happily. "How can I help you?" 

 "I, uh, I just..." Abby stuttered. 

 "Out with it dear. Nathan is just dying to get fucked some more, and as we both know, I'm the woman for the job." Nina teased. As she said this, she put her hands on her hips. This caused her robe to spread apart, revealing her belly and expansive cleavage. Abby glanced at her belly, and saw a slight bulge. A pregnancy bulge. So, the rumors were true. Abby shook her head and bit the bullet. 

 "Thank you Nina. Thank you for stealing Nathan from me. Thank you for showing me what I'm missing. Thank you for showing me I'm not woman enough for a man like him. You were right about everything." Abby said. It was the hardest thing she ever said. She didn't believe any of it. She was just telling Nina what she wanted to hear. Nina smiled. 

 "Okay. Now, get on your knees, dear." Nina said simply. 

 "You're not serious?" Abby asked. 

 "If you want to get anywhere, you have to pay your dues." Nina said. Abby gritted her teeth, looked around to make sure no one was watching, and kneeled in front of Nina. Nina smiled and turned around. She lifted the back of her robe, revealing her bare ass. 

 Abby pulled back, disgusted. But she knew what had to be done. She closed her eyes, pursed her lips, and quickly gave Nina's soft right butt-cheek a quick peck. 

 "Uh-uh, dear. Not on the cheek." Nina said, reaching back to pull her cheeks apart, revealing her asshole to Abby's eyes. Her asshole was leaking cum, having been freshly fucked there by Abby's former husband. 

 "Please no." Abby begged. Nina simply smirked. 

 "Make it a longer, juicy kiss too." Nina whispered. 

 Abby shook her head in disgust. How could she ask that? It was disgusting. 

 "Don't be scared, honey. Hubby loves doing it." Nina assured. 

 Her ticket to living a better life was kissing her former boss's asshole. Could she go on living this crappy life, working for a car magazine? She had always wanted to write about important events in the world, not mufflers and spark plugs. Abby shook her head. She had no choice. 

 Abby pursed her lips, looked straight ahead, and brought her lips forward, planting her lips against Nina's asshole on the front doorstep of Nina's house, for all of the world to see. Nina moaned loudly. She held the kiss for a second before pulling away. She unconsciously licked her lips and tasted the leftover residue of Nathan's cum. 

 Nina dropped her robe and turned around. She looked down at Abby, who was still on her knees, and shook her head. 

 "Honey, if you want to be a woman like me, you should have realized what I was doing. A woman like me would never end up on her knees, begging to kiss another woman's asshole. You're not cut out for this, darling. You still have a lot to learn." Nina said, with almost pity. 

 "But..." Abby started. 

 "I hope you enjoy the car magazine darling." Nina said. 

 "But you promised..." Abby started. 

 "That's all." Nina said, closing the door in Abby's face, closing her off from a world she would never know. As she heard muffled moaning from the other side of the door, Abby had to walk away, knowing they were living the life she could only dream of having.
