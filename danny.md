It started in high school and although I didn't know it at the time it would have far reaching consequences. Looking back on it I could see that it was just juvenile young teen bullshit; the kind of thing most teens go through and usually forget as they grow older. 

 Except in my case it didn't happen. 

 It was the ninth grade and I was more or less going steady with Mandy Light and had been since the eighth grade, at least I thought that I was. I'd given her a friendship ring and we did some hot necking whenever we could. 

 On Friday night I showed up at her house to pick her up for our date to go to the movies only to be told by her mother that she had already left for the movies with Donny Haight. I was confused for a couple of seconds thinking that I'd forgotten something, but then I remembered talking to Mandy during lunch at the school cafeteria about the movie we were going to see. Mandy knew I would be there to pick her up at six and she had taken off with Haight? 

 I didn't know what to think, but I did know I was pissed. I headed for the movie and when I saw Mandy and Haight standing in line at the ticket booth I walked up to them, grabbed Mandy's hand and pulled the ring I had given her off of her finger. I guess I wasn't to gentle about it because Mandy cried out in pain. Donny said: 

 "Hey! Leave my girl alone!" 

 "Shut your mouth Haight; this is between Mandy and me." 

 He went to push me away and it pissed me off and I punched him in the face and gave him a bloody nose. He started to come at me and I set myself to take him on, but some of the adults who were in the line grabbed us and kept us apart. One of them told us to take our beef someplace else. I turned and left. 

 I went on home and spent my time thinking of evil ways to make Mandy and Donny suffer. I finally fell asleep and when I got up in the morning I was over it. The only thoughts I had of Mandy were along the lines of "To hell with her!" 

 Around one that afternoon I was in the garage working on the 1971 Ford Torino that my dad and I were rebuilding hoping to have it ready by the time I got my driver's license when mom yelled out to me that I had a phone call. It was Mandy and as soon as I heard her voice I hung up on her. 

 I told mom that Mandy and I had broken up the night before and that I had no interest in talking to her so if she called again just tell her I was busy helping dad and unable to take calls. 

 I thought about things over the weekend and planned my coming week so I could avoid Mandy as much as possible. It would be hard because we were mostly both in the same classes, but it could be done. The only place I couldn't avoid her would be during lunch in the cafeteria. I could skip lunch, but decided not to. I could just ignore the stupid bitch. 

 Mandy did call twice more that weekend and both times my mom told her that I was not available to take calls. 

 When I got to school Monday Mandy was standing by the door waiting for me. She stepped forward to talk to me and I walked right by her without a word and headed for my locker with Mandy trailing along behind me telling me that we had to talk. I ignored her, got what I needed for my first class out of my locker and then headed for the classroom. 

 Avoiding her in class was easy because Mr. Wilcox used assigned seating and he went by the alphabet. Light was close to the front of the room and Zieger was at the very back so we weren't even close to each other. Also, when class was over I was closest to the door and was able to leave the room before she was even halfway to the door. 

 I managed to avoid Mandy until lunch and even then I waited for her to go through the line and take a seat before I grabbed a tray and went through the line. I picked a table on the other side of the room and sat down. I was two- thirds through my lunch when Mandy got up from where she was sitting and came over and sat down at my table. I looked up from my salad and when she said, "Why are you being such an asshole Danny?" I got up and walked away from the table. Mandy got up to chase me, but ran into Nancy Wilde causing both of them to drop their trays on the floor. By the time they got straightened out I was gone. 

 There was more drama that afternoon. After gym I was in the locker room when Haight came up to me, said "I owe you cocksucker" and threw a punch at me. I caught his wrist, pulled him off balance and then shoved him head first into the shower room wall. It dazed him and I must have gotten his nose again because blood was running down his face. I didn't say a word, but I wanted to get dressed and out of there before Mr. Williams came in to see what the disturbance was so I kneed Haight in the crotch and that took him out of play long enough for me to do what was needed to get me out of there. 

 Mandy was waiting for me by the door when school let out, but I walked right by her. She started to follow me all the while telling me to stop and talk to her. I started running and so did she, but she gave it up after a block. 

 About five that afternoon I got a call from Billy Neubert asking me if I wanted to go to the Arcade and maybe Harry's Malt Shop and I said I'd meet him at the Arcade at six-thirty. He was already at the Arcade and playing a pinball machine when I got there. There were some other kids there that we knew and we bummed around and played games for a couple of hours and then we headed over to Harry's Malt Shop. 

 Over a burger and fries Bill asked me what was the deal between me and Donny Haight and why the dust up in the locker room earlier in the day. I told him the story and he told me to watch out for Haight. 

 "I heard him tell a couple of other guys that he was going to get you." 

 "He won't try if he knows what's good for him." 

 "Shit! Speak of the devil." 

 "What?" 

 "He just walked in." 

 "So? He won't start anything in here. If he does Harry will bar him for life." 

 We sat and talked about a half a dozen different things and then it was time for us to go. I was maybe ten feet out the door when I heard: 

 "Hold up there shit for brains" and I turned to see Donny Haight coming out the door. "We have some unfinished business to take care of." 

 "Fuck you Haight" I said and turned my back on him and started walking away. 

 "What's the matter Zieger? Afraid of a fair fight?" 

 I kept walking. 

 "I knew you were a coward" he said and then he laughed as he said to the others who had come out with him "Look at the wimp run." 

 I turned and walked up to him and I guess he expected me to stop and then trade insults with him before we got into it because he just stood there smirking at me. I walked up to him and without saying a word I punched him in the face. Blood started running from his nose and he instinctively raised his hands to his face and I buried my fist in his belly. He gasped and bent at the waist which brought his head down to where I could bring my knee up into his face, but at the last second I decided to just hit him on the right side of his head with my fist. He went down to the ground and I considered kicking him a couple of times for good measure, but figured that would be overkill. 

 While he was down on the ground I bent down, grabbed a handful of his hair and pulled his face up close to mine and said: 

 "Any time you want to fight me I'll be ready to do it. I won't go out of my way to make it happen, but you had better be aware that I won't put up with your shit. You got a bloody nose Friday night not because you were with Mandy, but because you pushed me and you got another this afternoon because you threw a punch at me in the locker room. I'm not afraid of you Haight and I'll tell you this. The next time you want to try me I'll put you down and stomp the shit out of you and you had better fucking well believe it!" 

 I stood up and looked at the crowd that had followed him out to watch which, by the way, included Mandy, and said: 

 "See what a wimp can do if you piss him off?" 

 Then I turned and left. I didn't know if Haight would decide I wasn't worth the trouble or not, but I did know that whenever I was around him I was going to be ready. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next day when I got to school Mandy was again waiting for me at the front door of the school. Trying to avoid her seemed to be a waste of time so I decided to just get things over with. When she stepped in front of me I stopped and said: 

 "What the fuck do you want Mandy?" 

 That set her back some since I had never used language like that around her before. 

 "I want my ring back Danny." 

 "Tough shit Mandy. I don't want to give it back to you. You ended our relationship with the crap you pulled on me Friday." 

 "You aren't being fair Danny. You have to let me explain." 

 By then we had gathered a small crowd so more to embarrass than anything else I raised my voice so that even those at the rear of the crowd could hear me. 

 "Fair? You want fair? Was it fair to me when I showed up at your house to pick you up for a date - a date we had discussed only six hours before - only to find out that you had taken off with another guy? Was it fair to me when I showed up at the movies and found you holding hands with another guy while you were wearing my ring? You basically stabbed me in the back and you want me to be fair? Not in this lifetime Miss Light. Just stay the hell away from me. Spend your time with the dickhead you threw me over for." 

 I left her standing there and walked into the school. What I said must have registered because Mandy never bothered me again other than throwing nasty looks my way whenever we passed by each other. At least in high school. 

 Haight was a different matter. I'd embarrassed him in front of people not once, but three times and he was unhappy about it. Unhappy, but unwilling to confront me directly. He tried to get back at me indirectly. 

 We both went out for football and we both made the team. Haight was on defense and I was on offense. Every time the team had practice scrimmages I was Haight's target. Even if the play was away from me he came after me and took whatever cheap shot he thought he could get away with. I let him get away with it because if I would have clocked his ass I would have been thrown off of the team. I'd just get him away from school and settle his hash. 

 Of course he figured that is what I would try to do so he made damned sure never to be where I was. We managed to make it through high school without him doing me any serious damage. It wasn't all one sided though. I did manage to get back at him a time or two. During one scrimmage he intercepted a pass and the God's saw to it that I was the one in position to make the tackle on him. When I got up I slipped, accidentally of course, and as I fell I drove me knee into his stomach with my full 190 pounds behind it. He had to be helped off the field. 

 There were some other times too; enough to let him know that I was going to do my best to give as good as I got. 

 After graduation I headed for State to study Business Management and Haight went to some college back east. As far as I was concerned it was goodbye and good riddance. 

 The end of my relationship with Mandy did not mean that my social life was over. By the time I was old enough to get my driver's license my dad and I had the Torino up and running and as one of the few in my class with a car it wasn't hard to get dates. 

 My relationship with Mandy had soured me on long term relationships so I didn't tie myself down to any one girl. I deliberately dated girls who I'd seen bounce from one guy to another. We would date until the girl showed signs of 'jumping ship' and then I's stop calling her and move on to someone else. 

 They did tend to stay with me longer than the spent with other guys, but I didn't kid myself that it was because of my great looks and personality. It was because I had a car and thus the freedom to go places whenever I felt like it and I didn't have to make dates on a "If I can get dad (or mom) to let me use the car." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 My life changed again in the 12th grade. Her name was Pauline French and since the day she turned eighteen she had been the class punchboard and it wasn't because it was the only way she could get boys to date her. She was drop dead gorgeous and a walking wet dream. 

 Pauline fucked because she loved to fuck. Even though she could have had a steady boyfriend just by pointing to a guy and snapping her finger she did not have one. My sister Nancy, who was a grade behind me, told me that Pauline had told some of the girls in the shower room after gym class that she didn't want a steady boyfriend because he would get all pissed off and jealous when she tried on another guy. 

 "I like variety" Pauline had said. "I'm fascinated by the difference in guys. The different sizes and shapes; the way they do it to you and the different ways they taste. How some eat pussy and love it and others don't have a clue. Nope. No steady for me until I'm married and ready to settle down." 

 I'd never had a taste of Pauline, not that I wouldn't have liked to, but the circumstances never put us where I could ask her for a date. Not that I would have if given the opportunity. I wouldn't because I would have been afraid that the date would have eventually led to sex and I was sure that if that happened Pauline, with all of her experience, would laugh at me and possibly even ridicule me. 

 The sad fact is that I was still a virgin. Even in the eleventh grade when I was eighteen and legal (I'd missed a year because of a ruptured appendix) all of my female classmates (and therefore my dating pool) were mostly all sixteen and seventeen and sex with them could have put me behind bars. I'd necked hot and heavy with my under aged dates, but that was the extent of my experience. I was sure that Pauline with all of her experience would consider me a bumbling clown so I never tried my luck. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Then Fate, being the perverse thing she is, decided to fuck with me. 

 I was in the habit of giving my sister a ride home from school if she wanted one. A lot of the time she didn't because she had things she wanted to go do with her friends or with some guy she was dating. 

 That particular day it was raining off and on and so Nancy told me she would ride home with me. When I got out of my last class and headed out to go home I found Nancy waiting for me at the door and she had two girls with her. One of them was Pauline French. 

 "It's nasty out" Nancy said, "So would you mind giving Pauline and Linda a ride?" 

 She knew I wouldn't say no because I'd given her friends rides lots of times. Linda lived between the school and our house and Pauline lived six blocks past our place. We headed for the car and Linda and Pauline got in back and we headed out. We dropped Linda off first and as we approached our house Nancy said: 

 "Just drop me off at the house because I really need to pee" so I pulled over to the curb and Nancy got out and hurried up to the house. 

 Pauline got out of the back and got in front with me and as I pulled away from the curb Pauline said: 

 "I've seen the way you look at me Danny. How come you have never asked me out?" 

 "Because I'm scared to" would have been the honest answer, but what I said was "Because you always seem to have a boyfriend." 

 "Bullshit Danny. Having a boyfriend didn't stop you from asking Beverly Abbeg, Nancy Wilde or Carol Chasney out. What I think is that you have heard of my reputation and are afraid that you won't measure up to the others I have dated." 

 Time for honesty I thought and so I said, "That is pretty much the truth." 

 She slid over next to me and put her hand on the obvious bulge in my pants (I did mention that she was a walking wet dream right?) and then said: 

 "We won't ever know until you try." 

 I didn't know what to say to that, but by then we were pulling up to the curb in front of her house. She took her hand off of my dick, reached up and pulled the keys out of the ignition and then said: 

 "My folks won't be home until after six." 

 She slid back to her side of the seat, opened the door and then turned to see me sitting there like a stone statue and said: 

 "You are going to have to come into the house with me if you want to get your keys back" and then she got out of the car and headed up to the porch. 

 I know I said that I'd never tried to date Pauline because of my virgin status, but I wasn't brain dead. I wanted very much to lose that status and there wasn't any way in hell that I was going to ignore that blatant invitation so I got out of the car and followed Pauline into the house. 

 Once the door closed behind me Pauline turned, went to her knees in front of me and said as she pulled down my zipper: 

 "Let's see whatcha got sugar." 

 She opened my fly, reached in and worked my hard dick out into the open and then looked up at me and said: 

 "It's a nice one sugar and I'm sure that Paulie is going to like it." 

 She lowered her head and took me in her mouth. It was the very first time my dick had been in a hot mouth and the feeling was indescribable. I felt her tongue moving and then she slowly fucked me with her mouth. After a minute or so she took her mouth off me, stood up and said: 

 "Follow me sugar" and she led me up a staircase to where I guessed her bedroom would be. I followed along behind her and into her room and was surprised to see that her room looked like Nancy's. A real 'Girly girl' kind of room full of stuffed animals and male movie star posters on the wall. She must have had a thing for Brad Pitt because she had three posters of him. No one else had more than one on her walls. 

 I was just standing there watching her undress when she said, "Hurry up sugar. We only have three hours until my parents come home." 

 I got my butt in gear and started undressing while watching Pauline pull the bed covers down. 

 "Do you eat pussy?" Pauline asked as she got the bed ready. I figured that honesty was still going to be the best policy and I said: 

 "I never have." 

 She chuckled and said, "That is going to change today. Get over here sugar and get your first lesson." 

 The look on my face as I walked over to her must have clued her in and I saw sudden comprehension on her face. 

 "You're a virgin! God sugar; I never would have guessed it. Oh sugar; are we going to have fun." 

 And we did. 

 Paulie (as she preferred to be called) spent the next two and a half hours taking my cherry. We fucked, we sucked and then fucked again. We did missionary, we did doggie and we did something she called 'the rear leg lift.' She taught me how she liked her pussy eaten and then told me that I was the best at it the she'd ever had do it to her. 

 I was lying on the bed gasping for breath when she said, "You measure up Danny; you more than measure up, but right now we need to get up and get dressed and I need to straighten up my room. My parents will be home in twenty minutes." 

 We were sitting at the kitchen table pretending to work on Calculus homework when her mom and dad got home. She introduced me and then I said I had to get home as my mom would have dinner almost ready. As I was getting ready to leave Pauline asked: 

 "Give me a ride to school tomorrow?" 

 "Pick you up at a quarter after seven?" 

 "I'll be ready." 

 As I drove home I wondered about what had just happened. I wasn't sorry that it had, but I just could not figure out why. Why had Pauline, who had every guy in school hot for her and who had never (not to my knowledge anyway) had to go after a guy come after me. To me it did not make sense, but I doubted that I would ever know the answer to that question. 

 When I got home the first person I saw when I walked into the house was my sister Nancy. She looked at me and smiled as she made the 'shame shame' motion with her fingers and I realized that she knew just what I had been doing. I just shrugged and held my hands out in a "What? Who me?" gesture and headed up to my room to put away my book bag.  

 

 

===

I went down to the kitchen and asked my mother if there was anything I could do to help and she told me that I could set the table. At the dinner table I avoided Nancy's eye and when I'd finished eating and helping with the dishes I went up to my room to study and do my homework. 

 Maybe half an hour after I'd been in my room there was a knock at the door and then it opened and Nancy came in. 

 "She got you didn't she." 

 "I don't know what you are talking about." 

 "Oh yes you do. It was written all over your face when you walked in the front door. She said she was going to get you and it certainly looks like she did." 

 "She said she was going to get me?" 

 "Yes she did. She said it in the locker room after gym class and at least eight of us heard her say it." 

 "Why in the world would she say something like that? Why would she even want to 'get me' as you put it?" 

 "Because she couldn't stand it that you never tried to hit on her. Every other guy in school was trying to get in her pants except you. It was driving her crazy so she said if you wouldn't come after her she was going to go after you. There is no doubt in my mind from the way you looked when you got home that she was successful." 

 I didn't say anything to that so she said goodnight and went to her room. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 At a quarter after seven I knocked on Pauline's front door and when she came out I walked her to the car and opened the door for her. Once I was in the car she slid over next to me and said: 

 "Don't I get a good morning kiss?" 

 I turned to look at her and she grabbed my head and kissed me. Really kissed me; tongue and all. It caught me by surprise, but then I got with the program and tried to give as well as I got. Pauline finally broke the kiss and said: 

 "If we keep this up we are going to be late for school." 

 "I don't care." 

 "But I do. I'm trying hard for scholarships and being late or missing classes won't help me a bit." 

 I started the car and headed for school. Pauline sat right beside me all the way to school and a block before we got there she put her hand on the lump in my trousers and rubbed it saying: 

 "I don't want you to forget me sugar. I want you ready when you drive me home after school." 

 I parked in student parking and then Pauline aid, "Give me a kiss sugar. Give me something to hold me until class lets out." 

 We exchanged another scorcher of a kiss and when we broke it and started to get out of the car we saw several classmates watching us and I read the expressions on the faces of some of them. Plain as day those expressions said: 

 "She got another one. I wonder how long this one will last." 

 I'll have to admit I was wondering the same thing as I remembered what Nancy had said about Pauline's philosophy. I had no idea how long it would be before Pauline decided it was time to move to someone else, but I was going to take advantage of every day I could get. 

 The afternoon was sunny and dry and Nancy didn't want a ride home so it was just Pauline with me when I pulled out of the parking lot. She'd slid over and kissed me as soon as she got in the car and then she pulled down my zipper, worked out my already hard dick and then slowly jacked it all the way to her house. She had me ready to squirt by the time we pulled up in front of her house. We hurried inside and up to her bedroom. As soon as we were naked she went to her knees in front of me, took my dick in her mouth and brought me off in less than a minute. She kept me in her mouth and caressed my balls until she had me up again. 

 Once I was hard she stood up and pushed me so that I fell on the bed on my back and then she got on the bed and mounted me cowgirl. She rode me until I really needed to get off and I rolled her onto her back and fucked her hard. I got her off - twice I think - before I blew my load. 

 I was leaning over her (in what I later found out the Army called the front leaning rest position) when she said: 

 "Time for the numbers game." 

 When I looked at her with a blank expression on my face she laughed and said, "Sixty-nine you silly goof" and then moved so she was on the bottom and I was on the top. I couldn't believe how fast she was able to get me up again. Once hard she said, "Time for something new" and she got out of bed and went over to her dresser. She got something out of it and came back to the bed and handed it to me. It was a tube of KY Jelly. 

 "Time to do my butt sugar." 

 She told me how to prep her using the KY, my fingers and thumb and when she felt she was ready she told me to coat my dick with KY and ease it into her butt. 

 "Slow and easy sugar; slow and easy until you are all the way in." 

 I did what she told me and when she said, "Okay sugar; do it" I put my dick against her butt-hole and started to push it in. God, but she was tight. It took me several minutes to work myself all the way into her and then she said: 

 "Slow and easy until I get used to you." 

 I went slow and easy until she started pushing back at me and then I picked up the pace a bit. She as moaning the entire time: 

 "Oh yes; like that. Oh yes baby, just like that. Fuck me lover; fuck me." 

 Then it changed to, "Harder sugar; harder." 

 It took me longer to get off because I'd already cum twice and when I got ready to go she sensed it. Not hard to do since I was going harder and faster, but she knew I was getting close and she moaned: 

 "Stay with me lover, stay with me and get me off." 

 I was damned close and I wanted to nut, but I made myself back off a little and go slower. It was maybe a minute later she made that little cry that she made when cumming and I went back to hard and fast until I got off. When I pulled out she rolled over on her back and smiled up at me. 

 "Thank you lover. That was one of the best." 

 She looked at her bedside clock and said, "We have time for one more." She got off the bed, left the room and came back with a wash rag. She cleaned my dick and then went down on me again and again I was surprised at how fast she was able to get me back up to where I could answer the call again. Once she got me up she told me she wanted to do it doggie and so that is how we went at it. As I was pounding into her I was looking down at her butt hole and seeing my cum being pushed out in little squirts as I drove into her pussy and for some reason it fired me up and I fucked Pauline harder. 

 After we both got off we got dressed and were again sitting at the kitchen table when her parents got home. Pauline walked me to the door and asked, "Tomorrow at seven-fifteen?" 

 I smiled and said, "You bet." 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got home Nancy gave me what I could only think of as a 'smirk' and it was obvious to me that she knew where I'd been and what I'd been up to. And she wanted me to know that she knew. I set the table for dinner while Nancy helped mom in the kitchen. Dinner conversation was general in nature until Nancy said: 

 "Tell us about your new girlfriend Danny." 

 "You have a girlfriend?" mom asked. 

 "No I don't. She's just a classmate I give a ride home from school." 

 "And pick up and drive to school in the morning and then park in student parking and neck with until class time." 

 "Nothing wrong in having girlfriends Dan," my dad said, "Just don't get too serious. You need to get college out of the way first." 

 Mom laughed and said, "Says the man who hooked up with me in the ninth grade and made me promise I'd be only his forever." 

 When Nancy and I were doing the dinner dishes I asked her why she'd brought up the subject at the dinner table. 

 "You know all about Pauline. You are the one who told me about her way of looking at things. You know she will dump me in a week or two so why did you bring it up?" 

 "I like pulling your chain big brother and besides, I'm not so sure that Pauline will dump you in a week or so. She has never necked with a boy around school before." 

 Mom came into the kitchen and Nancy dropped the subject. We finished the dishes and I went up to my room to work on a paper that was due to be turned in that week. 

 I was thinking of what Nancy had said as I drove over to pick up Pauline. She was wrong and I knew it. I was just a guy Pauline was curious about. It bothered her that I hadn't come after her so curiosity got to her and she came after me. Curiosity satisfied she would move on to her next experience in a week or so. 

 When I picked Pauline up it was a repeat of the day before. She slid over and kissed me and then rubbed my dick all the way to school. We made out in the parking lot until class time and then she told me to be ready for a hot time when I drove her home. 

 And a hot time it was indeed. 

 Pauline and I were still going strong after a month and I was expecting the kiss off to happen any day, but Pauline gave me no sign that I was a short timer. 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

Pauline said, "You have been awful quiet these past couple of days. Something bothering you?" 

 I just shrugged and she said, "No you don't sugar. Don't sluff me off. What is the problem?" 

 I suddenly decided to get it over with so I said, "My problem is you." 

 "Me sugar? How am I a problem for you?" 

 "I'm waiting for the axe to fall and I'm not handling it well." 

 "The axe to fall? You need to be a little clearer than that." 

 What the hell I thought, go ahead and put it out there. I told her what Nancy had told me and then said: 

 "You have never stayed with any one guy for more than two or three weeks and I've already been with you for over four so I'm just waiting for you to dump me and move on." 

 She gave me a look I couldn't decipher and then she said, "I should dump you for being such a dumb shit. Did it ever cross your mind that maybe - just maybe - that I see something in you that I've never seen in any of the others? Yes I did say what Nancy told you I said, but I also changed guys because I couldn't find what I wanted. Not to hurt your ego any, but there are guys out there who are bigger than you in the penis department just like there are plenty with less than what you have. 

 "To me a fuck is a fuck is a fuck if you get my meaning. They are all good, but some guys don't bring much more than their dicks to the party. Some want all the head they can get, but won't reciprocate for one reason or another. Most won't do anal because according to them only faggots and queers butt fuck. A lot are dumber than stumps and only try and hold a C average so they can play sports. A lot of the guys I've gone with just want to get themselves off and don't care if I get mine. 

 "You probably don't realize it Danny, but you are the total package. You have lettered in three sports, are a straight A student and you treat a girl the way she wants to be treated. When you pick me up you don't park at the curb and blow your horn. You come up to the house and get me and walk me to the car and open the door and hold it for me and when you bring me home you walk me to the door. Most of the other clods I've gone with just pulled up at the curb, wait for me to get out and then drive away. 

 "The real biggie is that you always and I do mean always see to it that I get off. You probably don't even know that you are doing it, but you always make sure that my needs are met before you stop. You like oral and anal and you are the only guy who has ever gotten me off by eating me or butt fucking me. Again sugar, you are the total package and I'm hanging on to you for as long as I can." 

 That was the last thing I expected to hear from Pauline, but if she was intent on keeping me for as long as she could I was damned sure going to let her even though I knew that it would only be for another four or five months. Why only that long? Because once high school graduation was out of the way I was going to be going to State and Pauline was going to Walton on scholarships and the two were a twelve hour drive apart. Still, five months was better than nothing. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Things were not always smooth and easy. Haight noticed that Pauline and I were keeping steady company and being the asshole he was he tried to move in on her and try to take her away from me. Pauline laughed at him and told him she didn't play with "Little boys" and he took it to mean that she as talking about his dick and he slunk off which made no sense to be since we had seen each other in the showers at school and we were pretty much the same size. Pauline told me later that she had said what she said because to her he was always acting like a twelve year old. 

 Besides Haight there were other guys who knew of Pauline's past and wanted their turn. A few didn't take kindly to be turned away and since they couldn't take it out on Pauline they thought they could take it out on me. Thinking to insult me they joked about my not being able to get a decent girl and having to settle for a whore. Phil Fisher get a broken nose out of that one, but the shit didn't stop until the day Marv Peebles called me a cocksucker by proxy telling a couple of people that as slutty as Pauline was I had to be sucking the cum of a dozen guys out of her. His broken nose, dislocated jaw and four missing teeth seemed to convince everyone else that it would be to their benefit to keep their mouths shut as far as Pauline and I were concerned. 

 My biggest problem as far as Pauline was concerned came from an unexpected quarter. I swung by Pauline's one day to see if she wanted to go out for a drive and maybe stop at Harry's for a milkshake. I'd totally spaced out on the fact that Pauline saw a tutor every Wednesday to work on her Spanish. Her mother told me that she wasn't home and then asked me in saying she had something she needed to talk to me about. 

 I followed her into the kitchen and she offered me a Coke and told me to take a seat at the table. "Danny" she said, "You are a nice kid and I'd hate to see you hurt. As far as my husband is concerned Pauline is the apple of his eye; his pure as the driven snow princess. If he were to find out you are fucking his princess I don't know what he would do to you, but I can guarantee it wouldn't be pleasant." 

 I sat there stunned into silence as she said, "Don't bother to deny it Danny; I'm the one who washes the sheets on her bed. You aren't fooling me with the pretend studying when I get home. The question Danny, is what has to happen to keep me from sharing that information with Pauline's father. You get the picture?" 

 By then I'd gotten a grip on myself and I told her that yes I did indeed get the picture. "Good" she said and she pulled her sweater up over her head and I saw she was braless as her tits bounced on her chest. "I'm not in bad shape for an old broad" she said as her skirt hit the floor followed by her panties. As I sat there staring at her naked body I could see that she was not in bad shape for an old broad. My erection damned near ripped through my jeans. 

 "All it will take to buy my silence is what you are giving my daughter. Deal?" 

 In my defense I can only say that I felt I had no permanent relationship with Pauline and I fully expected that we would end on graduation and when she left for college and to a young guy pussy was pussy and what red-blooded guy was going to pass up a chance at a sexy older woman who was standing naked in front of him. I was standing up and reaching for my zipper bedfore the word "Deal" was fully out of her mouth. She laughed and said: 

 "We have at least two hours before Pauline and my husband get home." 

 What Pauline had must have been passed down to her through her mother's genes because sexually mother and daughter were as alike as two peas in a pod. .Momma couldn't get enough. We fucked, went sixty-nine, fucked and then she sucked me hard again. The third time was doggie and seeing her puckered brown eye I reached down and probed it with a finger which got me an: 

 "Oh you nasty boy you. You going to fuck my ass?" 

 She wanted it, but I didn't think I had enough time to work her up, work my way in, and get done in the time we had left so I said, "Next time' and went on fucking her. When we were done she said: 

 Harvey doesn't get out of his lodge meeting until nine and then he picks Paulie up at the tutor's place so get here early next Wednesday okay?" I nodded a yes and then she said: 

 "It goes without saying that nobody ever knows about this but us right?" 

 "My lips are sealed." 

 For the next five weeks I was happy as a pig in a large and deep mud puddle. I was fucking Pauline three or four times a week and Mrs. French (that's all she would let me call her) every Wednesday night. 

 And then disaster struck. 

 I picked Pauline up on Thursday morning and when she got in the car she didn't slide over next to me like she usually did. She leaned against the door and shot me a dirty look. We went two blocks before she said a word and then it was something that I could have gone without hearing. 

 "When I told you that you were the total package I didn't realize that the package included also being a fucking cheating asshole." 

 I looked over at her and my facial expression must have clearly said, "What the hell does that mean?" so she went on to tell me. 

 "My tutor was sick yesterday and so I came home early. Care to hazard a guess as to what I found when I walked into the house?" 

 "Oh fuck me!" I thought as I gripped the steering wheel and started straight ahead. 

 "You two were making so much noise you never heard me come up and look into the room. Any idea as to how I felt to see my supposed boyfriend fucking my mother? Not only fucking her, but fucking her in her ass?" 

 I didn't know what to say so I said nothing and paid attention to my driving. 

 "How long have you been fucking my mother?" 

 Looking back on it I know how stupid it must have sounded when I said, "She made me do it. She threatened me." 

 "And you expect me to believe that?" 

 "Why not; it's the truth. She knows about you and me because she saw the evidence on your sheets when she washed them. She told me if she told your dad he would come after me with a baseball bat. She said she wouldn't tell him if I gave her what I'm giving you." 

 "That is the most ridiculous line of bullshit I've ever heard." 

 "I don't care if you believe it or not, but it happens to be true. Just ask your mother." 

 "Oh yeah! Right! I can just picture that. "Hi mom, guess what. Danny says he is fucking you because you threatened him." There is no way I can go to her and let her know that I know she is cheating on my dad and with the guy who is supposed to be my boyfriend.." 

 "Why not? She is going to know anyway when I tell her that you caught us." 

 By then we were in the student parking lot and as soon as I was parked she got out of the car and stormed off. She avoided me all day at school and she wasn't waiting at the car for a ride home when school let out so I accepted that we were done and I wouldn't get the last five months I thought we would have before she went off to Walton. I didn't bother to pick her up for school on Friday and she avoided me at school so I went into the weekend at loose ends. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 On Saturday Nancy noticed I seemed down and she asked why I wasn't out doing something with Pauline. 

 "She broke up with me Thursday." 

 "Just a little tiff that you'll get over?" 

 "No. It is over and done." 

 "Cool. I've got a dozen girlfriends who are interested in seeing just what you have that made Pauline latch onto you." 

 "No thanks. I'm not anywhere near ready to start thinking about getting involved with another girl." 

 "You had better start thinking about another girl if you are planning on going to your prom. You only have six weeks to find a replacement for Pauline." 

 "If I go I'll go stag." 

 "Not if I can help it." 

 "Stay out of it Nance" I said as I went out to the garage to work on the Torino. 

 The weekend flew by and Monday at school Pauline ignored me as she had the previous Thursday and Friday. Nancy didn't stay out of it like I'd told her and when I got to my car when school let out Nancy was there with Carol Meese. I knew what was up when Nancy asked my to drop her off at the house and then give Carol a lift home. 

 Carol wasn't the least bit subtle. On the way to her place Carol said, "I heard that you are no longer seeing Pauline. Is that right?" 

 "Looks that way." 

 "I'm not doing anything tomorrow. Want to take in a movie?" 

 "I've got something going most of the week. Care to do it Friday?" 

 "It's a date." 

 I dropped her at her place and went on home and when I got there Nancy asked, "How did it go?" 

 "I asked you to stay out of it." 

 "You didn't really think I would did you?" 

 I just shrugged and headed for my room. 

 "Hey! You didn't answer my question." 

 "We have a date for Friday." 

 "You can thank me later" she said as I left the room. 

 I gave Carol a ride home on Tuesday and Wednesday and mostly we talked about what we would do on Friday. After dropping her off on Wednesday I drove over to the French residence and rang the doorbell. Mrs. French answered the door, saw that it was me and said: 

 "What do you want?" 

 "It is Wednesday." 

 "So what?" 

 "We always get together on Wednesday." "Not any more. Not since you broke up with Paulie." 

 Her cold matter of fact attitude pissed me off so I said, "I did not break up with your daughter; she broke up with me and do you want to know why? She came home early last Wednesday and caught us fucking. We were making so much noise that she came up and looked in the room and saw me buried in your ass." 

 Her face paled when I said that and I went on, "We were so into it that we never even saw her standing in the doorway watching. It seems that it upset her enough for her to tell me to take a hike. She was so mad that she said she might even tell her father. Given your pissy attitude right now maybe I'll beat her to it." 

 I turned to leave and I wasn't three steps down the walk when she called out, "Wait Danny" and I looked back over my shoulder at her as snarled "Fuck you lady" and kept on going. Let the bitch think that either Pauline or I might rat her out. I'd lied to her about Pauline saying she might tell her dad and I sure wasn't going to do it. If she was right when she told me her husband would come after me for fucking Pauline I didn't even want to think about what he would do to me if he found out I was fucking both his wife and daughter. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I was not expecting what happened Thursday after school. Pauline was waiting at the car when I got there. I looked around for Carol and Pauline said: 

 "She's not getting a ride home from you tonight. I chased her off. We need to have a sit down Danny." 

 "Why? Your "Fuck off and die" attitude came across loud and clear. What do we have to talk about now?" 

 "My mother grabbed me as soon as I got home and told me that you had stopped by. I can't believe that you told my mom that I'd seen you." 

 "Why wouldn't I? She was still holding her threat over my head so I had to show up to make sure she wouldn't follow through on her it. She pissed me off with her attitude so I told her why you told me to get lost." 

 "Did you really tell her that you might tell my dad?" 

 "Damned straight I did! After you calling me a liar and her pissy attitude toward ME for breaking up with you I was pissed. I told her that so she could sweat things a little. See how she liked being threatened." 

 "Are you really going to tell him?" 

 "Don't be stupid Miss French. If I was so worried about what he might do to me if your mom ratted me out just image how I'd be feeling if he knew I was screwing you both. I do not have a death wish. Now if you will get out of my way I have things to do." 

 I started to get in the car and she said, "Wait a minute. We still need to talk." 

 "Sorry Miss French, but I have no interest in talking to you" and I got in the car and drove off leaving her standing there. 

 The next day at lunch period when I got to the cafeteria I saw Carol at a table and I joined her. 

 "Where were you yesterday afternoon?" 

 "Your girlfriend chased me away." 

 "She isn't my girlfriend." 

 "That's not what she says." 

 "Bullcrap. She kicked me to the curb last Thursday." 

 "Apparently you must have misunderstood what she was saying to you. She spread the word this morning that you were hers and that the reast of us should stay away from you." 

 "She can make you do that?" 

 "We girls have a pact Danny. We don't mess with another girl's guy. As long as Pauline says that you are hers you are off limits to the rest of us. If she ever says that you are history where she is concerned there are a whole bunch of us who will be after you like a duck after a Junebug." 

 She got up and left and as she walked away I wondered just what the fuck was going on. Last week I was an asshole and was totally ignored. This week I'm 'hers' and everyone needs to keep their hands off? I sat there and picked at my lunch while wondering why things had to be so complicated. I looked up and saw Pauline heading for my table so whitout even finishing my lunch I got up and left the cafeteria. 

 I should have known that it wasn't going to be easy. 

 When class let out and I got to my car I found Pauline sitting on my left front fender waiting for me. Before I could say a word she said, "You WILL get in the with me and you WILL listen to what I have to say." 

 The car was locked so I said, "Fuck you Miss French" and started back toward the school. I'd sit in the library and study until Pauline got tired of waiting and left. An hour and a half later I came out to find Pauline sitting in my car reading a text book. I stopped and stared. I knew damned well that the car was locked when I went back into the school. There was nothing for it I was going to have to get in the car and probably listen to her shit, but she would be in for a bit of a surprise when I drive to my house, parked leaving her to walk home from there. 

 I got in the car, started it and then asked, "How in the hell did you get in here?" 

 "Billy Neubert has a 'slim-jim' and I asked him to open the door for me." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because we need to talk." 

 "Again, why? You as good as told me to fuck off and die last Thursday so what is there to talk about?" 

 "That." 

 "What?" 

 "That is what we need to talk about. I have to apologize for what I said and what I was thinking. I had a long talk with my mother. You scared her near to death when you told her that I was so pissed I might tell my dad and that you just might beat me to it. You scared her so bad that she came to me and begged me not to do it. I'm sorry that I insinuated that you were a liar, but in my defense just stop and think how dumb your explanation sounded especially to the daughter of the woman you were fucking. Why in the world would you even expect me to believe it? A woman old enough to be your mother screwing her daughter's boyfriend? Cut me a break here Danny." 

 Looking back I could see how ridiculous it must have sounded to her and she was fresh from seeing me buried in her mother's ass. But I was still pissed so I said: 

 "Is that it? Are we done talking now?" 

 "I hope not. I'm hoping that you will accept my apology, drive me home, fuck my brains out and then start making plans for the prom with me." 

 That was totally unexpected. 

 "Are you serious?" 

 "Bet your bippy I am." 

 I was still pissed, but I was nowhere near being stupid and after having been without sex after having a steady diet of it I was not about to say no. Ten minutes later I was dropping my trousers as Pauline was turning down the bed. Just that quick we were back to being a couple. We finished up and I left before her mom got home. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Saturday we went to the movies and Sunday we went skating at Skate City. We couldn't screw on the weekend because both sets of parents were home and I didn't have enough money for a motel room. I suggested the back seat of my car, but Pauline wouldn't go for it. "I won't take even the slightest chance of getting caught in public" is what she said. Monday and Tuesday we tried to make up for what we missed on Saturday and Sunday and I do have to admit that she wore me out both time. I was glad I was going to have Wednesday off to recuperate. 

 When I picked her up on Wednesday morning to drive her to school we talked about the prom on the way. We necked for a couple of minutes when we got to the student parking lot, but just before we got out of the car she said: 

 "Try to save enough for me tomorrow." 

 "What?" 

 "Don't wear yourself out tonight." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "Have you forgotten that it is Wednesday?"  

 

 

===

I looked at her what I'm sure was a confused expression on my face and she said, "My mother silly." 

 "What are you talking about?" 

 "It is Wednesday and my mom is expecting you to show up." 

 "What?!" I exclaimed, but I was talking to her back as she got out of the car. I hurried after her and asked her what the hell she was talking about. By then we were at the door and she told me she would tell me over lunch and she hustled off to her first class. 

 He beat me to the cafeteria and as already seated when I got there. I sat down and said, "Okay; what gives?" 

 "I had a long talk with mom and I found out why she did what she did. It turns out that my dad has something they call severe erectile dysfunction. I short, he can't get it up and mom has been going crazy because the lack of a sex life. You came along and she was desperate enough that she made her move on you. As highly sexual as I am I knew what she had to be going through not getting any. In short; I told her I would share. I don't know about you, but I see it as a win/win situation for us." 

 "Now that is something that you are going to have to explain to me." 

 "You know that it isn't going to be easy for us when we graduate and go off to college. We will have weekends, holidays and vacations when we can be together, but I know that you like sex as much as I do. You will have my mom to take the pressure off of you and I won't have to worry about some other girl getting her hooks in you while I'm gone. Plus, you will be getting in good with your future mother in law." 

 That was my first inkling that Pauline expected that we were in it for the long haul. 

 "You can't blame me for thinking that this is a joke right?" 

 "It isn't a joke lover-bunny. I told you that I had a long talk with my mother about this. She moved on you because I'd already told her that you were a keeper. She never moved on any of my other guys because she saw them as transients. Only around for a couple of weeks and then gone. If she would have gone after any one of them she ran the risk of having my disgruntled ex putting out the word on her. Once I made it clear that I wasn't going to dump you like I had the others she decided that you would be a safe bet. You wouldn't say anything because you would be afraid that it would get back to me. It would have worked if I hadn't come home when I did." 

 At that point lunch was over and we got up and headed for our classes. .Just as we were leaving the cafeteria Pauline said: 

 "Don't disappoint my mom okay?" 

 I nodded a yes and she said, "See you in the morning lover-bunny." 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

I was a little uneasy as I approached the front door of the French residence. I reached to push the doorbell, but before I could push it the door opened and there stood Mrs. Mrs. Frence naked except for high heels. 

 "Surprised?" she asked. 

 "You won't believe how much." 

 "Well come on in and let's get to it." 

 I was wrung dry when she finally turned me loose to get dressed. We had done it all. Oral. Anal, missionary, doggie and sixty-nine. 

 "I hope you weren't disappointed" Mrs. French said. 

 "Not even" I said and then added, "But scared to death." 

 "Why would you be scared?" 

 "Pauline caught us because she came home unexpectedly." 

 "So? We settled all that between us." 

 "Yes, but what if your husband comes home unexpectedly?" 

 "I guess that is something that could possibly happen, but he never has in the last ten years or so." 

 "I've heard it said that there is a first time for everything." 

 "I guess you are right. Let me think on it. See you next week?" 

 "Only Pauline can stop me." 

 "She won't and you can believe me on that." 

 I was having a bunch of mixed thoughts on my way home. I was happy with my situation for the most part, but there were a lot of unknowns. Pauline took it as a given that we were going to stay together, but would we? If we did what kind of relationship would I have with her mother? If Pauline and I did marry would both women expect me to continue taking care of them? And don't think for one minute that I didn't pick up on what Pauline implied when we had our talk in the cafeteria. The "You like sex as much as I do" part. Her mom could take care of me and see to it that no other girl got her hooks in me? Did she think I didn't know that she was as good as telling me that was going to get her needs met while she was at Walton? 

 I knew that with her highly sexual nature that she wasn't going to go without and what if she found another 'total package' that had a touch more going for him than I had and decided to replace me? Then I thought "So what." While Pauline already had me down in her mind as her husband I wasn't all that sure that she would end up being my wife. I knew what Pauline's long range plans were and even as young and inexperienced as I was I could see the trouble I would have as her husband if things went as she hoped. 

 Pauline was working hard with a tutor on her Spanish to prepare herself for going to work with her dad. He had an import/export business that dealt mostly with companies in Latin America and I could see Pauline having to do a lot of travel to Latin American countries. After I got my business management degree I would be joining the family business and there would be very little, if any, travel as part of my job. I didn't think I would like having a part time wife. I could see me just being a filler between her globe-trotting trips. 

 That brought up another thought. Had Pauline been thinking that far ahead? Was this thing with her mother her way of seeing to it that I was kept occupied while she was gone? If so that implied that she didn't plan on going without while she was away. I'd seen what had happened to the marriages of some of my parent's friends where one of the couples traveled for business and in most cases it wasn't pretty. 

 By the time I pulled the blankets up and my head hit the pillow I had decided "Fuck it! Take what you can get while you can get it. Worry about what happens when you graduate from college when that time gets here." 

 In the morning I picked Pauline up and on the way to school my Wednesday afternoon with her mother was never mentioned. In fact it wasn't even brought up at any time during the week that went by until the next Wednesday rolled around. Even then all I got was a "Save enough for me" when we got out of the car at the student parking lot. 

 After an extremely exhausting session of oral and anal sex Mrs. French said, "I have given your worries some thought and I have a way to end them. My sister Irene has an apartment in town and she says we can use it. But there is a slight catch." 

 "What is it?" 

 "She is going through a divorce and is pretty much as sexually needy as I am. She said that I might have to share you with her if things don't break right for her." 

 "Can you sell that to Pauline?" 

 "She wants you kept busy while she is away at school so I don't think that it will be a problem and after all it would be keeping it in the family right?" 

 I wisely kept my mouth shut. We would just have to wait and see what happened if things didn't 'break right' for Ilene. 

 The next Wednesday Mrs. French and I played at Irene's apartment, but servicing Irene never came up. 

 It went that way for the next two weeks; momma never mentioned Pauline and Pauline never mentioned momma. It was a totally weird situation, but I wasn't going to complain. I had to be the best laid nineteen year old in the state and maybe even in the surrounding ones. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Then it was prom time and for the first time since Pauline and I had started spending time together Mr. French decided to have a talk with me while Mrs. French and Pauline were upstairs working on Pauline's prom dress. It was a Thursday, the day before prom night, and Pauline and I had finished play time and were sitting at the kitchen table only this time we weren't pretending to be working on home work. Pauline was trying to teach me some simple phrases in Spanish. She felt I should have at least a little of the language when we honeymooned in Aruba.Her parents came home and the two women went of and left me alone with Mr. French and as soon as they were out of earshot he said rather bluntly: 

 "I was young once myself and I know how boys your age think. I also know what young guys think about come prom time. I want you to understand something boy. I expect my daughter to walk down the aisle a virgin on her wedding day. You just keep that in mind when you go to those after prom parties. You do not want me as an enemy lad. You understand me?" 

 I told him that I heard him loud and clear while I was doing my absolute best not to laugh out loud. Pauline a virgin when she walked down the aisle? The man was clueless! I wanted to ask him if he knew how to turn back time. 

 Then he told me that he expected me to have her home no later than three a.m. All I could say was "Yes sir" even though I knew damned well that Pauline had no intension of home at all before the sun came up on Saturday morning. She had already given me a list of the parties we would attend and a sub-list of parties we would go to if at all possible. I didn't see any way that we could get I all done before noon. I didn't bother to tell Mr. French that. I'd tell Pauline about it and let her deal with it. 

 I did bring it up on the way to school the next morning and she just shrugged and said, "I'm over eighteen and all he can do is give me the old "As long as you are under my roof" speech and I'll just tell him "Okay. I'll just go and stay with Gram." My grandmother is cool. She told me when I turned eighteen I could move in with her any time I wanted. I don't think she ever liked my dad. I do know that she was pissed when mom married him because mom told me so." 

 We had a great time at the prom and Pauline told me that what made the night for her were the dirty looks that Mandy sent our way. She and Mandy had never gotten along from way back in grade school. Pauline told me that before we hooked up she had thought of trying to take me away from Mandy just to piss Mandy off. Mandy's date was Donny Haight which came as no surprise to me. I'd seen them together when I was out and about. I got nasty looks from him whenever we saw each other, but he stayed away from me. 

 We hit a couple of after prom parties and around two Pauline said "It is time that we do something that we have never done together." 

 "What's that?" 

 "Sleep together." 

 "We do that all the time." 

 "No we don't. I'm not talking about making love; I'm talking about waking up in the morning with you." 

 I didn't even hesitate and said, "Where to Miss French?" 

 "The Fantasy Island Motel on Sixth. We have a reserved room." 

 Nothing different happened in room 102. It was pretty much the same as usual. Missionary, doggie, cowgirl, sixty-nine and anal. What was different was when we got to where I couldn't respond again we snuggled up to each other and fell asleep. 

 Waking up with Pauline wrapped around me was a new sensation and I liked it. I also liked Pauline's way of greeting the new day, but eventually we got to the bas part. The part where I had to take her home and face her father. 

 "Don't sweat it" she said. "It is a Saturday and he always goes into work on Saturday. He won't be there when we get there. I can't remember a Saturday when he didn't go in to work. I think that is part of why my parents are having problems." 

 She was right and he wasn't there and when I walked Pauline to her door she gave me a hot steamy kiss and said: 

 "Thank you for a perfect prom lover." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Things stayed pretty much the same on the run up to graduation. Pauline two, three and sometimes four times a week and Mrs. French on Wednesdays. With graduation out of the way and summer staring us in the face things slowed down. Way down. 

 Pauline went to work for her father so there was no more after school bed play and we had to make do with occasional dates. Occasional because quite often Pauline had to work late. I was still stopping by to visit Mrs. French every Wednesday and while it was always satisfying I wasn't getting near as much as I used to get with Pauline in the rotation. 

 I still went places and did things in the evenings and I would occasionally run across Mandy and Haight. A couple of times I ran into Mandy without Haight and a couple of those times she tried to hook up with me, but I wasn't interested. At least not until one Tuesday night when I was out looking for some friends to hang with. I was out looking for company because Pauline had called me and told me that she would be working late again. 

 I was downtown and I just happened to see Pauline get out of a car with a man and go into Maxims which was a fairly upscale restaurant. They were holding hands as they walked up to the door and went inside. Curiosity got the best of me so I gave it about ten minutes and then I went inside. I saw Pauline and the man sitting in a booth next to each other. Not on opposite sides where they could look at each other while they talked and ate, but side by side. Pauline was leaning into the man and her head on his shoulder. Her left hand was on the table holding the man's right hand and I didn't care to see any more so I turned and left. 

 I hit the arcade, but didn't see anybody I knew, but I didn't really feel like looking for friends any more so I got on a pinball machine and started playing it. I'd been there twenty minutes or so when a voice behind me said: 

 "You have nothing better to do than spend your evening wasting money on that thing? "I'm sure I can find us something better to do than that." 

 I turned and found Mandy standing there. I was just in the right mood so I said, "Whatcha got in mind?" 

 "Get out of here and go somewhere private where I can mend some fences." 

 "Lead on" I said and she turned and headed for the door and I followed along. Once outside she spotted the Torino and headed for it. I opened the door for her, she got in and I went around to the driver's side and got in. She slid over next to me and said: 

 "Find us a place a little more private than this." 

 I drove out to Stephen's Point and parked. It had been a silent ride and once I put the lever in 'park' I said: 

 "Isn't Haight going to be a little upset over this?" 

 "Screw him! He's a jerk. I made a big mistake when I lost you and I'm trying to correct it. How is Pauline going to take it?" 

 "Don't know; don't care. I found out tonight that she has other interests." 

 "Well then I guess we need to get busy and get to work on erasing the two of them from our minds." 

 She pulled my head to her and kissed me. It turned into an extremely hot make out session. It got as far as my getting her bra off of her and a finger in her pussy before she stopped me. 

 "I want our first time to be on a bed. My parents are out of town on business so why don't you take me home." 

 Mandy wasn't a virgin. She'd given it up to Haight or one of the others she had dated after I dropped her. She saw the look on my face and said: 

 "It should have been you. I wanted it to be you. But we are together now so let's make the most of it." 

 It was a long night. She wanted to try everything and I did my best to accommodate her. I was the first one to eat her pussy or no one else had done it right. I managed to get her off by munching on her muffin and once she settled down she said: 

 "My God baby; I never realized it could be so good." 

 When I finally couldn't get it up anymore I got up and reached for my pants she asked: 

 "Where are you going?" 

 "Home. I need to get some slep before I have to get up and go to work." 

 "Uh uh. I've got you back and I'm not letting you get any farther away from me that I absolutely have to. Tell me what time you have to get up and I'll set my clock." 

 When the clock went off at seven it was the second time in my life I woke up with a warm female body snuggled up next to me. It was a habit I could learn to like. Mandy started playing with my dick and I had to push her hand away telling her that I didn't have enough time to do her justice. 

 "My parents don't get home until Friday night. Does that give you any ideas?" 

 "Are you sure?" 

 "Positive. What time can I expect you? I'll have dinner ready." 

 It was a Wednesday and Mrs. French would be expecting me, but I decided that the quickest way to end things with Pauline would be not to show up to visit her mother. I would no doubt hear from her on Thursday morning wanting to know where I was and I could get it done then. I told Mandy she could expect me sometime between four-thirty and five. I kissed her goodbye and headed off to work. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I got to work my dad gave me a grin and said, "You really should call your mother and let her know when you aren't going to be coming home at night." 

 "I don't know if I can handle what she is going to ask or say when I tell her that I probably won't be home until Friday." 

 "Pauline's parents out of town?" 

 "Pauline is history." 

 He raised an eyebrow at that and I headed for my job on the loading dock before he could comment on that. 

 The day went fast and when lunch time came I called my mom and told her I was staying with a friend for a couple of days and that I'd be home on Friday. I was surprised when I didn't get any questions from her. 

 When I got to Mandy's she did indeed have dinner ready. Meat loaf, mashed potatoes and green beans. She even had a bottle of wine open and ready. Over dinner we talked about my day and what we would be doing when summer was over. By unspoken agreement we kept Pauline and Haight out of our conversation. When dinner was over we went out onto the patio and continued the conversation and finished the bottle of wine. 

 After about an hour Mandy asked me if I was ready for dessert and when I asked what it was she told me that I would have to come up to her bedroom to find out. For the second morning in a row I woke up with a warm female body snuggled up next to me. 

 Lunch period was almost over when I got the expected phone call from Pauline. 

 "Mother missed you last night. Where were you?" 

 "Getting reacquainted with Mandy." 

 "What's going on Danny?" 

 "I've decided to give our relationship a second chance." 

 "There were a couple seconds of silence before she said, "What about us?" 

 "Were you thinking of us Tuesday evening when you were at Maxims all warm and cuddly with that guy you were sharing your booth with?" 

 More silence from her end and then I said, "Thanks for calling Pauline. You take care now" and I hung up on her. 

 The rest of the day went quickly and after work I headed for Mandy's. It was a repeat of the previous evening and when I was dressed and ready to leave for work in the morning Mandy asked me when she would see me again. 

 "Not tonight. I have to go home so my mom can see that I'm still alive. I don't have anything planned for Saturday if you have it free." 

 "I do. Can we go to the lake? I'll make us a picnic basket." 

 "It's a date." 

 I kissed her and headed for work. 

 All day at work I was asking myself if I really wanted to get back into a committed relationship with Mandy. I couldn't forget what happened that caused us to break up and come fall she would be going off to college. She was going to Baylor in Texas and I wouldn't see her except for holiday breaks and vacation. As much as she like sex I didn't think she would go without while she was gone. Plus the length of time we would be apart would give her plenty of opportunity to get into a long term relationship. 

 Then again, one thing that I'm not is a hypocrite. I wouldn't be going without while she was gone, at least not on purpose. I wasn't going to go without when Pauline was gone so why would I when Mandy was gone. Granted it would have been a hell of a lot easier in Pauline's case because of her mother. I didn't have that option with Mandy and even if I did I wouldn't take it. Mandy's mom looked like Aunt Bea on the television show Mayberry. 

 Then I had to ask myself why I was even wasting my time thinking about such things. Nothing was going to happen in the way of long term romances until I finished college and that was four years away. Maybe even more if I decided to go for an MBA and a hell of a lot could happen in four or five years. 

 The day went pretty fast and as I was getting ready to leave my dad said, "I thought you told me that Pauline was history?" 

 "I did." 

 "I guess you forgot to tell her that." 

 "What?" 

 "You'll see" he said and then he had to answer the phone. 

 I saw what he was talking about when I walked out into the parking lot. Sitting on the left front fender of my care was Pauline. She slid off the fender, walked up to me. Threw her arms around me and tried to kiss me. I say 'tried' because I turned my head and she missed my lips and got the side of my face just below my ear. 

 "What do you want Pauline?" 

 "You Mr. Asshole; I want you." 

 "You didn't want me Tuesday night. In fact you told me we couldn't see each other because you had to work late. And yet I saw you being all lovey-dovey with some guy at Maxims." 

 "I was working late Danny. Daddy, Mr. Lopez and I had been working on a contract most of the afternoon. When we finally hammered out a deal daddy asked me to take Mr. Lopez to dinner while he had the contract typed up. Then I was to bring Mr. Lopez back to the office so he could sign the document." 

 "You really think that I'm that stupid Pauline? I saw you walk into Maxims holding hands with the guy. When I looked into the restaurant I saw how you were sitting with him and holding hands on the table." 

 "It was just harmless flirting; trying to keep him in a good mood. His business is important to daddy. He never even got a kiss." 

 "That's not what it looked like to me. You were much too touchy-feely with him to suit me. You can say you didn't do anything, but what I saw makes me disbelieve it." 

 "Even if that is what you are thinking why are you taking it out on my mother?" 

 "Oh come on Pauline. How can I still see your mother when you and I are through? The last time we broke up she slammed the door in my face. When you see her tell her I'm not a blabbermouth. No one but the three of us will ever know. Now if you will excuse me I have some place I need to go."  

 

 

===

I opened the car door and as I was getting in Pauline said, "This isn't over Danny. We were meant to be and I'm not going to quietly fade away." 

 "Yeah yeah right" I thought to myself as I closed the door, started the car and drove off. 

 Mom said, "Welcome home stranger. We thought maybe you forgot that you lived here." 

 I got a 'knowing' look from Nancy and then I asked mom what I could do to help and she told me I could set the table. Surprisingly the over dinner conversation stayed away from where I'd been and what I'd been doing. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I spent Saturday at the lake with Mandy and Sunday we went to the movies. I'd gotten paid on Friday and had enough money for a motel room and that is where we finished our date on both days. Unfortunately Mandy had to be home on those nights so there was no waking up together. 

 Monday at work when lunch time rolled around I got a phone call from Pauline. 

 "I talked with mom and she said she knows you will keep quiet about her and she doesn't care if you have dropped me she still wants to see you. She said to tell you that it doesn't only have to be Wednesdays now that you aren't seeing me. Call her Danny. It won't hurt you to talk to her." 

 I told her I would think about it and then said that I had to get back to work. 

 I did think about it and the more I thought about it the more I thought it would be to my benefit. It would certainly be a benefit when Mandy went off to college. It would save me having to spend time and money trying to find a replacement for her while she as away. The only thing that made me hesitate was that it would still leave me partially connected to Pauline and I wasn't sure that I wanted that. Then it occurred to me that it shouldn't matter all that much since Pauline would also be away at school for most of the next four years. When she did come home on breaks and vacations I shouldn't see much of her as her mom and I would be meeting away from the house. I decided to do it. 

 When I got off work I called Mrs. French. I asked her straight out if what Pauline had said was true and she said it was. I told her that I would see her next Wednesday and she said that she meant it when she told Pauline to tell me that it didn't only have to be on Wednesdays. I told her that it was something I would have to think about and I'd dicuss it with her when I saw her. 

 I swung by Mandy's and Mandy didn't expect her parents to be home until late, but I didn't want to take a chance on getting caught if they came home early. 

 "We can do it until my folks get here" Mandy said. 

 "I don't know about that Mandy. We have no way of knowing what time they will get home and as into it as we get we probably wouldn't even know they were home until they were at your bedroom door checking out the noise coming from the room." 

 "I've thought about it all day and I've come up with a way to do it and not get caught." 

 And so it was that at 8:23 we saw Mandy's parents pull into the driveway. I've heard it said that timing is everything and it proved to be the case when Mr. and Mrs. Light got home. Mandy was bent over the back of the couch watching the driveway through the living room window when I blew my second load of the night into her at exactly 8:23 by my watch. When her parents came into the house they found us sitting on the couch holding hands and watching TV. Shortly after that I left and went home. 

 I'd just finished having breakfast with my parents and Nancy and was getting ready to leave for work when I got a phone call from Mandy. She had to cancel our date or that evening. Her grandmother had passed away and she and her folks were going to Ann Arbor for the funeral and then stay several days with family. 

 

 When I got off work I called Mrs. French to set up a time to meet with her at her sister's apartment on Wednesday and she said: 

 "What's wrong with right now?" 

 I laughed and said, "I can be there in ten minutes." 

 "Bet you I can beat you there." 

 She did and was already down to nothing but her high heels when I got there. 

 "We won't have as much time as I'd like" she said. "I need to be home by eight so les not waste a minute okay?" 

 I don't know about her, but I felt that I used every minute we had wisely and I was a very satisfied young man when I went home. Before I left Mrs. French told me that she could stay until on Wednesday if I was interested. Care to take a guess as to what I told her? 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 I did see Mrs. French on Wednesday and then again on Thursday and before I left we made plans for Friday. It almost didn't happen. About an hour before quitting time I got a phone call from Pauline. She cut right to it. 

 "You can't see my mother any more Danny. My dad is getting suspicious. Ten minutes ago I heard him on the phone making an appointment with a private investigator." 

 "Does your mother know?" 

 "I called her before I called you. It isn't the end of the world Danny. I'm still available." 

 "Thanks for the call Pauline" was all I said before hanging up the phone. 

 As soon as the call from Pauline ended I called Mrs. French. 

 "I just heard from Pauline and she said she'd already called you." 

 "She did, but what she told me won't stop us from getting together today will it?" 

 "If he put a private detective on you we could get busted. That wouldn't bother me, but it would put you in deep doo-doo." 

 "I don't think so lover. Even if Frank got an immediate appointment whoever he hires couldn't get on the case right away. In fact even if he was talking to the man at this exact moment in wouldn't hurt us today. In order to catch us he would need to outside right now in order to be able to follow me. We can still have today lover. After today we will have to see, but I will think of a way. I'm leaving for Irene's as soon as I hang up. See you there?" 

 "I'll be there' I said as I hung up wondering if we would ever get together again after today. Well, at least we still had today. 

 The session at Irene's was exhausting for me. Mrs. French wanted to get as much out of me as she could. 

 "It might have to last me for a while lover. Frank isn't going to pay for the detective forever. If the detective doesn't find out anything in a couple of days, maybe a week at the outside, Frank will end it. It just means that you and I will need to take a break from each other for a while." 

 As I dressed she said, "Don't call me lover. Wait for me to call you okay? If Frank does hire a detective one of the things that the detective will probably do is put arecording device on the phone." 

 I told her that I would wait for her call and then I left and went home. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Mandy and her parents came home on Saturday and Mandy called me and told me she needed to see me. I picked her up around noon and asked her what she would like to do. She told me that she had enough money for a motel room so I should get busy and find one. 

 Mandy tried to make up for lost time and she flat wore me out before she dropped the bomb on me. 

 "I'm going to be moving to Michigan. I'll probably be leaving in about two weeks." 

 "Why?" 

 "My grandmother was quite wealthy and my mom was her only child. She left mom her business and her house so she and daddy are going to sell our house here and move to Ann Arbor. I was mentioned in the will also. There is a trust fund for me that will pay for my college degree, but to get it I have to go to Michigan State. I also have to join the sorority that she was in when she went to school there. I have to take it Danny. If I went to Baylor it would be on scholarships and I'd have to find a job to help me make it, but if I do what grandma's will calls for everything will be paid for and I'll even get an allowance of one thousand a month. The trust will even pay for an apartment if I don't get accepted into the sorority and can't live at the sorority house." 

 The news wasn't crushing because I had already accepted that I wouldn't be seeing much of Mandy anyway when she went to Texas. 

 "I've got two weeks before we move Danny and I want to spend as much of it with you as I can." 

 She did spend a good bit of it with me and then there was a tearful farewell leave taking where she promised she would find a way to come back and see me as often as she could. I was pretty sure that she meant it when she said it, but I was also of the mind that it wouldn't happen. There would be too many new things going on for her to spend much time thinking of me. I might be on her mind for the first couple of weeks or so, but after that? Not so much. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 A week after Mandy left I got off work after putting in two hours of overtime to find Pauline sitting on the fender of my car again. As was her usual blunt style she went right to it. 

 "Ready to come back to me lover? Your steady bailed on you and mom has cut you offo you should be horn as hell right now. I can take care of that for you." 

 "Why would I want to get back with you Pauline? In case you don't remember I don't take your working late all that well." 

 "I told you there was nothing going on there baby. It was just some harmless flirting to keep him in a good mood until he signed daddy's contract." 

 As I stood there listening to her the thought that what she was saying could just as easily true as not and what did it matter anyway? Even though Pauline talked like we were forever I didn't buy into it. All along I expected that once Pauline went off to college she would find other things to occupy her time and I was willing to bet good money that some of those other 'things' would have hard cocks attached to them. 

 I didn't put any stock at all in her saying she would come home on weekends, holidays and vacations. So, I asked myself, why not take what you can get while you can get it and look for other fields to plow after Pauline was gone. In two weeks she would be gone so why not see to my lack-a-nooky problem for the next two weeks? 

 "What do you have in mind" I asked. 

 "Follow me and find out" she said as she slid off the fender of my car and headed for hers. I followed her to her dad's business and she pulled up in back of the building and parked. I parked next to her and got out of the car. She got out of hers and walked up to the back door, took a key out of her pocket, unlocked the door and went into the building. I followed along behind her and watched as she worked the key pad for the alarm system and then followed her into an office. In the office there was a large desk, two comfortable looking chairs and a couch. Pauline walked over to the couch, bent at the waist and took hold of a strap hanging from the bottom of the couch and pulled. The couch was a sofa bed and as Pauline worked it all the way out she said: 

 "Hurry up and get your clothes of lover." 

 It had been a while since Pauline and I had played, but just like riding a bicycle it all came back and Pauline wasn't satisfied until she could get me back up again. 

 For the next two weeks Pauline and I used daddy's couch almost every night. Sometimes we didn't get started until late because her dad did work late some evenings, but as soon as he was clear of the building and parking lot Pauline and I made good use of his office. 

 At the end of the two weeks Pauline was off to school an since I hadn't heard from Mrs. French I was suddenly back to wondering when, where or even if I was going to find a new ladt friend. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 When I attended Freshman Orientation I found myself in what my father, who was a former fighter pilot, would call a target rich environment. Maybe two hundred of the three hundred or so new freshman were females and not just young ones. There were also a lot of older women. I just knew that I could get lucky sooner or later. 

 I got my schedule and on the first day of class I found myself sitting in a classroom where the class consisted of nineteen girls and seven guys. I was wrong in one thing though. I might have been in a 'target rich environment' but I wasn't hitting any of the targets. 

 I made several attempts to meet and date girls. The ones I knew from high school had boyfriends and it seemed like the ones I was meeting at college had all come from someplace else and just weren't interested in me. It probably didn't help that I had some misguided idea and that I was someone special and it showed in my attitude. 

 In my defense I can only point out that Pauline came after me and then didn't give me up like she had so many others. Then there was Mrs. French. An older experienced woman who couldn't seem to get enough of me. And Mandy of course. She wanted to fuck me all the time. All of that had me thinking that I was something that I obviously wasn't. 

 The few locals that didn't have boyfriends seemed to have some sort of agreement not to poach on Pauline's (or maybe Mandy's) territory and for some reason I didn't understand I could never seem to 'click' with the girls who weren't local. I got plenty of dates, but they never went anywhere. I decided to say to hell with it and concentrate on school and on my part time job working for my dad. 

 Two months after school started the one thing I never expected to happen did. It was Friday. My last class let out at three and when I got to my car I found Pauline in her usual spot. Sitting on my left front fender. She slid off the fender as I walked up and opened her arms so I could walk into them. 

 "Hi lover; miss me" she said and then she kissed me. "I told you I would come home to see you." 

 I thought better of responding with, "You said every weekend and it has been over two months." Before I even say a word she said, "I've got enough for a motel room so let's get to it." 

 As we got in the car she said, "You seem surprised to see me." 

 "I am. I expected that once you got to college you would have found a new circle of friends and lots of new things to do. I didn't expect to see you back except for breaks and vacations." 

 "Nonsense lover. I told you I would be back and I'm sorry it wasn't sooner, but it took some time to settle in and get a routine going. I'll be here every weekend from now on." 

 She slid over next to me and put her hand on the hard-on that she knew damned well was there. 

 "Mom taking good care of you for me?" 

 "I haven't seen her since you told us what your father was doing. She gave me a long look before saying: 

 "Found yourself another girlfriend?" 

 "Nope. Hasn't been anybody since you left." 

 She got a big smile at that and I know what she was thinking. "He's saving himself for me." I wasn't about to tell her that it was because I couldn't get anyone else. 

 Our first time at the Coral Gables was quick, but she got right to work on getting me up again - and again - and again - until it couldn't happen anymore. As we lay next to each other and she fondled my unresponsive cock she asked: 

 "Can I have you the whole weekend?" 

 "I have to work a half day tomorrow. From seven until one, but after that I'm free util my first class on Monday." 

 "I want all of your time from when you get off work until I have to leave for school at eight on Sunday night. I'm keeping the room so you get your butt back here as soon as you get off work okay? 

 "You got it." 

 She called the front desk and left a wakeup call for six and we snuggled up and fell asleep. 

 There was no time for a morning wakeup bout and as I dressed Pauline told me that she would probably spend the morning with her mother and I told her to say hi to her mom for me. 

 I had the keys to work (it helps to be the bosses son) and once I got there I put the coffee pot in the breakroom on and then got busy in the back room. We were closed on the weekends so I was alone in the building and had no distractions as I got all of the orders set up to go out on Monday morning. 

 I did get a phone call from dad around ten. "You need to let your mother know when you aren't coming home. She does worry about you." 

 "Sorry, but Pauline showed up and I kind of forgot about calling." 

 "Pauline? I thought Mandy was your girlfriend." 

 "I haven't seen or heard from her since she moved." 

 "I guess I should let your mother know that you won't be home tonight either?" 

 "Probably. Pauline has to head back to school tomorrow so I should be home after she leaves." 

 "Did you get the Osburne order together?" 

 "Boxed and waiting for UPS." 

 "Okay then; see you tomorrow." 

 I finished up what I needed to get done and then I locked up and headed for the Coral Gables. 

 Pauline was there waiting for me and when I asked her what she wanted to do that afternoon she laughed and said, "Silly boy" and started taking off her clothes. We went twice before I called a halt to things. 

 "I haven't eaten all day and I'm going to need to fuel up if you plan on getting much more out of me today." 

 "Spoil sport, but I guess you have a point. If I'm going to need to get enough of you to hold me until next weekend you will need your strength." 

 The way she said it almost sounded like she wasn't going to get any until she came home for the weekend, but I didn't believe it. Not for one second. As highly sexed as she was I couldn't see her going a day or two without let alone a week. But of course kept my mouth shut. Take what you can get Dan while you can get it is what I told myself. 

 Over dinner she told me that she had talked to her mother about me. 

 "She wants to call you lover, but she is afraid to. Ever since she found out that dad was calling a private detective she imagines she is under constant surveillance. She sees, or thinks she sees someone watching her everywhere she goes. She thinks the home phone has a recorder on it, her car has a GPS hidden on it and she checks every time she gets in the car to see if there is some kind of recorder under her seat. 

 "I tried to tell her that is was highly unlikely that daddy would pay out as much as it would cost for fulltime surveillance, but she says he could be paying for spot checks so she doesn't do anything." 

 "You sound almost disappointed that she can't get together with me." 

 "I am. I was planning on her being my first line of defense where you are concerned. You are mine lover and I don't want some other chick latching onto you while I'm not around to protect my turf." 

 We went back to the motel and Pauline proceeded to drain every ounce of energy out of my body before we fell asleep. I woke up to Pauline fondling my cock. 

 "God girl! Don't you ever get enough?" 

 "Not of you lover. I can never get enough of you." 

 After we had a morning wakeup we went to the Waffle House for breakfast. Over waffles and bacon Pauline said: 

 "I've given it some thought and I think I've come up with a way to get you and mom together." 

 "Hows that?" 

 "We can get around her worry about her phone calls being recorded by getting two Tracfones and you use them to talk to each other. We get around the GPS thing by having her drive to some place she has every reason to go to and you meet her and take your car to wherever you do the deed and then you take her back to her car." 

 "That doesn't address the fact that she might be followed." 

 "That's not a problem." 

 "It isn't? How can you be sure of that?" 

 "Because it doesn't matter. Say you decide to meet her at the mall. She parks at the south end and you park at the north end. She comes into the mall and you'll be where you can watch her come in. If there is anyone following her you will see them. If no one does she goes out the north end and gets in your car. If someone does follow her you give her the signal she is being watched and she hits a couple of shops and then goes home." 

 "You been reading spy novels?" 

 "No. Just think creatively. You think it won't work?" 

 "Doesn't matter to me. I don't care if anyone finds out or not. It is your mom's problem. She is the one who doesn't want to get caught."  

 

 

===

"That's pretty callous of you." 

 "No it isn't. I have no interest in your mother. You are the one trying to push me into a relationship with her. You have any idea of how weird that is to me? Understand me here Pauline. I won't run from her if she wants to fuck me, but chase after a woman old enough to be my mother? No! 

 "Another thing to consider. You assume we are forever, but I don't. There are four years before we finish school and one hell of a lot can change in four years. Three quarters of that time you will be spending at school where you will meet a whole bunch of new guys and you will attract them and we both know it. You will have ample opportunity to meet a couple that you might decide are more to your liking than me. 

 "We both know your sexual history Pauline. I know you aren't going to remain celibate at school. There is one other thing. What if against all odds we do end up married. What kind of relationship would we have with your family? Would you still expect me to see to your mother's sexual needs? This whole thing is just too weird to a simple guy like me." 

 "You really expect me to fuck around at school?" 

 "Of course I do. I can even see how you will rationalize it. I'm home getting it from your mom so it should be all right for you to do it too." 

 She just looked at me in silence for ten seconds or so and then said, "Take me back to the motel." 

 It was a silent ride to the Coral Gables and when we got there she said, "Don't bother coming in" as she got out of the car. 

 I sat there and watched as she went into the room and saying to myself "Way to go Dan. Open mouth, insert foot and turn a sure sex life into dust." 

 I drove away from the motel and went on home. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 The next month and a half went by and was filled with school. I didn't have any time for a social life even if I would have had a girl to have a social life with. Well, that wasn't exactly true. I could have made time if I would have had the girl, but I just didn't feel like wasting the time trying to get a date only to be rejected time after time. Sound like I'm sayin g that it sucked to be me? That's the way I was feeling. 

 It all changed one Thursday afternoon in the student cafeteria. I was between classes and I was sitting at a table drinking a coke and reviewing my notes on my last class when a voice said: 

 "Mind if I join you?" 

 I looked up from my notes and saw Claudia Wlkins standing there. Claudia was from some place back east and she was in three of my classes. I looked around and saw that the cafeteria was half empty and Claudia noticed. 

 "I know there are plenty other places I could sit, but I want to sit here" and she sat down. 

 I looked at her and I didn't have a clue as to what to say. 

 "Cat got your tongue?" 

 "No. Just don't have a clue as to what is going on." 

 "Simple really. Curiosity finally got the best of me.." 

 "Curiosity? About what?" 

 "What makes you so special that the word is out to stay away from you." 

 "I don't know what you are talking about." 

 "Most of the girls who live hear tell those of us who aren't from here to stay away from you. They have most of us thinking that you are some sort of pervert or something equally as bad. One girl finally told me that the reason is that you are the private property of a girl who goes to school someplace else and has asked the local girls to see that no other girl gets to you. Is that true?" 

 "Not a bit. There is a girl who I used to go with who goes to school at Walton, but I haven't seen her in months and even so there is nothing serious between us." 

 "That's good to know. So there is no real reason why we can't go out tomorrow evening?" 

 "None that I can see." 

 She looked at her watch and said she had to get to class and asked me to meet her for lunch the next day to work out the details. I told her I would be there. 

 I did meet her the next day and we set a time. I picked her up at Martin Hall at six and I noticed disapproving looks from a couple of local girls who were friends of Pauline. I had a really good time with Claudia and when I got her back to her dorm I got a kiss and an invitation to do it again soon. I did take he out again on Tuesday and when that date was over we set up another one for Friday. 

 I was in a good mood Friday when I got off work at six. I had just enough time to get home, shower and then get to the dorm to pick up Claudia. The good mood evaporated when I got to the parking lot and found Pauline sitting on my left front fender - again! When I walked up to the car I considered saying something flippant like "We have to stop meeting like this" but decided to go with the old tried and true: 

 "What the fuck are you doing here Pauline?" 

 "I'm hearing that someone is making a move on my man and I decided that I'd better get here and find out what is going on." 

 "I am not 'your man' Pauline and even if I once was the way you walked away from me the last time we were together and the next two months without hearing from you pretty much told me that even if we did once have something we didn't have it any more. Now get off my car. I have a date tonight and I don't want to be late." 

 She slid off the fender and as she walked around the car to the passenger side she said, "Where are the three of us going" and got in the car. I walked over to the door meaning to open it and pull Pauline out of the car and when I got to the door and reached for the handle she stuck her tongue out at me and made a show of pushing down on the door lock. 

 I went around to the driver's side and got in and said, "Get out of my car Pauline." 

 "Nope! Not gonna do it. You are my man and where you go is where I'm going to be." 

 I thought to myself "Fuck this shit" and I started the car and drove home. I got out of the car and walked into the house leaving Pauline sitting there. If she wanted to make an ass of herself then let her. I didn't know how Claudia would take it when I showed up with Pauline, but I didn't much care either. I liked Claudia, but I had no great attachment to her. For lack of a better way of putting it there was no 'spark' there. She was just a girl to date and have fun with. 

 I showered, put on clean clothes and then walked downstairs to find Pauline sitting n the couch talking with my mom. That solved my problem. I'd go into the kitchen, go out the back door and around the house to get in my car and drive off leaving Pauline on the couch with my mom. Hat plan died a quick death when Pauline stood up and said: 

 "About time. I was afraid we were going to be late." 

 Mom said, "You kids have fun" and I was stuck with Pauline. I kissed mom on the cheek and told her no to wait up for me. I headed for the door with Pauline a little bit behind me. Plan B (or was it C) was that as soon as we were out door I'd run for the car, get in, lock the doors and drive off leaving Pauline standing in the driveway. 

 I should have known I wouldn't get away with it. Pauline must have been able to read my mind because once we were out the door SHE ran to the car and got in. Well, I had made a date with Claudia and I was going to keep it Pauline or not. 

 Pauline chattered away on the drive to Claudia's dorm.and I stayed silent and payed attention to my driving. 

 "What are we going to do? I hadn't planned on going out tonight so I'm not really dressed for it. Think these clothes will be alright?" I was silent and watched the road in front of me. "You don't really like this girl do you? You can't. If you really liked her you wouldn't want to see me scratch her eyes out." 

 I stayed mum and she switched gears and started telling me about her classes, her grades, her roommate in the dorm and all sorts of other stuff. She was still babbling away when I pulled up in front of Martin Hall. I parked, got out and went inside to get Claudia. Before walking her out to the car I told her what was going on and then I asked her if she would rather pass on the night's date and reschedule for Monday. 

 "Of course not. This could be fun. It will certainly be a story to tell years from now." 

 As we walked to the car Claudia said, "Let me handle this." I walked her to the passenger side door and opened it for her. Pauline slid over to the middle of the seat to let Claudia in, but Claudia said: 

 "Uh uh honey; this is my date and if you insist on horning in you get to sit on the back seat. Dan is too nice a guy and won't do anything to you physically, but it won't bother me at all to rip the hair off your head." 

 Pauline smiled and said, "You would end up looking a little bald yourself if you were to try, but I guess fair is fair. I won't take the back seat to anyone. You can have the middle, but you are going to have to go around to the driver's side to get in. I'm not stepping out of the car so I could end up getting locked out. You slide in and I'll slide over." 

 "That'll work" Claudia said and walked over to my side of the car and got in. I just shook my head and followed along. Once inside I started the car and pulled away from the curb as Claudia asked: 

 "What are we going to do tonight?" 

 "I had planned on going to a movie and then hitting Harry's Malt Shop for a bite to eat, but I don't know if that will work now." 

 "Works for me" Claudia said and then Pauline piped up and said, "Sounds good to me too." 

 I shrugged and point the car toward the Cineplex. I let Claudia pick the movie out of the six showing and then I bought tickets for the here of us. The movie Claudia chose was a romantic comedy chic flick and I can't say that I enjoyed it all that much. I might have enjoyed it more under other circumstances, but the situation I found myself in was just a bit awkward. 

 When we took our seats I ended up in the middle with Claudia on my right and Pauline on my left. Pauline kept trying to hold my hand and I kept jerking it away from her. Of course Claudia noticed and she giggled and took my right hand in her left I finally stopped fighting Pauline and ended up sitting there holding hands with both of them. 

 When the movie was over I drove over to Harry's and we got a booth toward the back. Claudia sat next to me and Pauline sat on the other side of the table and immediately started trying to play 'footsie' under the table. Once we had given our order to Sally I excused myself and headed for the men's room. After taking my whiz I washed my hands and headed back to the booth were I saw Claudia and Pauline talking like old friends. "What's up with that?" I asked myself as I approached the booth. As soon as I sat down Claudia said: 

 "I asked Pauline what was so special about you that she put a 'hands off' notice on you. She said that part of it was that you are a tiger in bed. Why don't I know that about you?" 

 "Because we aren't far enough along in our relationship to have reached that stage." 

 "Does that mean you expect to get to that stage sometime?" 

 "Hey lady; don't forget how our relationship started. I seem to remember you as being the aggressive one." 

 "She also says that she intends to marry you when she graduates." 

 "That is her plan and not mine. She just took it for granted that I would go along." 

 "You saying that you don't want to marry her?" 

 "I'm saying that graduation is almost four years away and that a lot can happen in four years. Things that might change plans made earlier. Pauline knows how I feel about the subject. In fact the reason she hasn't been around for the last two months is because I told her what I thought and she didn't like hearing it. The only reason she is here now is that she heard I was dating you and why that bothers her I can't even begin to fathom." 

 "Bullshit Danny! You know damned well why it bothers me" Pauline said. "You are supposed to be mine. I know it and so do you even if you don't want to admit it." 

 "No I don't know it. Yes we did have something going, but at no time - not even for a minute - did I look at it as being forever. And I've told you why. The fact that you don't want to accept it is on you not me." 

 "So what is it that I'm missing here?" Claudia asked. 

 "Nothing that we can go into" I said, "It is a little on the personal side." 

 "I'll tell you what it is" Pauline said to Claudia. "He thinks I'll be screwing around on him while I'm away at school and I might just decide that some other guy is a better catch than Danny so he says we have to wait until we graduate and see where we are before he will commit to me." 

 "Are you screwing around on him at school?" 

 "I haven't yet, but I expect that I will from time to time. I'n not a virgin and I like sex. Danny knows that and he also knows that I've told him he is my man and I'm always going to be his." 

 "You admit that you will probably be fucking around on him, but you put a 'hands off' on him because you don't want him to get any? Isn't that a bit one sided?" 

 "No it isn't. The 'hands off' was to try and keep him from hooking up with someone he might get emotionally attached to. I expect him to get laid and I even went so far as to set it up so he could have a sex life without my worrying that some other girl trying to steal him from me. And no, I am not going to explain that and I doubt that Danny will either." 

 Claudia looked at me and I shrugged and said, "Nope! Not going there." 

 All three of us were silent for a few seconds and then Claudia broke the silence by saying: 

 "Okay; let me see if I have this right. You don't care what Dan does as long as it is no threat to you. Am I right?" 

 Pauline nodded a yes and then said, "Pretty much." 

 Claudia turned to me and asked, "Would that work for you?" 

 "Would what work for me?" 

 "Having a friends with benefits relationship with a girl who had no interest in getting married to you?" 

 You didn't have to be the sharpest knife in the drawer to know the answer to that one. The truth was that I would like a life married to Pauline; I just didn't think it was possible with four years of being mostly apart. Could I wait out those four years if I could keep myself occupied with someone not interested in stealing me away from Pauline? Hell yes!! So my instant answer to Claudia was: 

 "It would work for me." 

 Then Claudia asked Pauline the same question and Pauline said, "It would as long as I knew that she was no threat." 

 Claudia smiled and said, "Good! I'm glad we got that settled." 

 Almost in unison Pauline and I said, "Got what settled?" 

 "My only interest in Dan was that 'hands off' thing. It piqued my curiosity so I went after him to see what was so special about him that some girl wanted to keep him for herself. I have a fiancée back in St. Louis that I intend to marry when I graduate. I want something 'safe' to keep me occupied until then. Gary knows I'm not going to keep my legs closed for four years just like I know he won't settle for just masturbation for those same four years. So do the three of us have a deal?" 

 "Pauline said, "It will work for me." 

 They both looked at me and I shrugged and said, "I'm in." 

 Then Pauline said, "However it won't start until Monday. I made the weekend trip so I could get my itch scratched. He's mine until I leave for school Sunday and then I'll be home every other weekend. We can work out holidays, breaks and vacations later." 

 "One thing though" Claudia said, "He is going to have to take me back to my dorm before the itch scratching starts." 

 I walked Claudia to her door and she stood on tip-toe to kiss me and then said, "See you Monday baby." 

 I got back in the car and Pauline said, "Let's go get my car and you can follow me to the Coral Gables." 

 It was a long and tiring weekend and we never mentioned our last meeting and her two month absence. 

 To be continued.  

 

 

===

I was eating my lunch in the Student Union cafeteria and reviewing class notes when Claudia joined me. 

 "We still on for tonight?" she asked. 

 "We are" I said and we set a time. 

 We had a very nice date and I behaved myself. I was going to let Claudia set the pace since she was, in spite of what had been said at the Friday night meeting with Pauline, uncharted territory. As we left Harry's she said: 

 "Bad news baby. Aunt Flo came to visit this afternoon and it will be Thursday before she leaves. It will be Friday before I can do what I want to do with you." 

 I knew what "Aunt Flo" meant because I'd heard my mom and sister use the term a time or two. Pauline just referred to it as 'her time' and with her it never slowed us down. "That's what anal is for sugar; so we don't have to go without." 

 It didn't really upset me because after the workout Pauline put me through over the weekend I wasn't sure that I could have done Claudia much good if she had wanted to play at the end of our date. She did give me several hot kisses when I took her back to the dorm. 

 We dated on Tuesday and Wednesday and had some very hot make out sessions and on Wednesday she told me she would give me a hand job or head to hold me until Aunt Flo was gone but I told her no. 

 "Not until I can give as good as I get." 

 She gave me a long look and then said, "I'm beginning to see some of what Pauline sees in you." 

 I could have mentioned anal, but as I said earlier Claudia was uncharted territory and just might find the thought of anal sex as repulsive or dirty and depraved and might have her telling me to take a hike. I wasn't ready for that. At least not just yet. 

 Friday night Claudia invited me in to her room at the dorm and I found out that she was every bit as accomplished as Pauline and Mrs. French when it came to tings sexual. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Claudine and I got together two and sometimes three times a week and every other weekend Pauline came home. Surprisingly the routine helped my grades go up. I didn't have to waste time trying to get a girl a girl to go out with me and then working on the relationship and because of that I had more time to study. 

 Then the holidays came and Claudia went home to St. Louis and Pauline came home from Walton. Then Pauline went back to Walton and Claudia came back to school. The routine continued until summer vacation and then Claudia went home and Pauline came home. 

 During the time Pauline was home she constantly talked about where we would live when we got married, how many children we were going to have and things like that. I began to believe that she was serious about us getting married when we graduated. 

 One thing we never talked about was what she did when she was at school or what I did when she was away. She knew what I was doing and I of course assumed that she was doing the same thing. I didn't know for sure and I damned sure wasn't going to ask. 

 There were a couple of sticky spots during the vacation. Two times Pauline invited me to her parents' house for an afternoon barbecue and both times I felt awkward around Mrs. French. We never did find ourselves alone so we didn't have a chance to talk and I never found out what had happened the last time I had been with her. But I did wonder what kind of relationship I was going to have with her if Pauline's plans did come to fruition. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 In the fall we went back to the routine. Things went along that way for the next couple of years and then in my senior year things went to shit on me. I never knew the story about what happened because neither mom nor dad would talk about it, but something bad must have happened because they split up and divorced. 

 We lived in a no-fault state and so everything had to be split fifty/fifty. Apparently neither one wanted the house so it was sold. I did know that mom got half of the business and that mom didn't want to buy out dad's half and she wouldn't sell her half to him. Dad apparently didn't want any ties to mom and when she wouldn't sell to him he sold his half to somebody else. Mom wasn't interested in the business with dad gone so she sold off her half. 

 Of course all of it had an impact on me and in more ways than one. It hit me both emotionally and financially. When dad moved out Nancy and I ended up staying with mom until it was sold. It was awkward as hell living with her and being afraid to say anything that might be the wrong thing to say and since neither parent would clue us in as to what was wrong anything we said could have been the wrong thing. 

 On the other side I was still working part time at the business so I saw him almost every day and I couldn't talk to him either except about things pertaining to work. Then the house was sold and I was put in the position of who did I want to live with? I guess it didn't bother Nancy the way it did me and she chose to stay with mom. To me it didn't matter which one I went with; it would make the other parent think I was choosing sides. Just try to imagine it. If I chose to stay with mom dad would think I loved her more than I loved him or maybe even thing I was siding with mom against him. And it would be the same with mom if I went with dad. 

 I was pretty much an emotional mess and I guess the two of them must have figured it out because they did get together enough to solve my problem. The house was almost paid for and they had a lot of equity to split. Each of them gave me some money to start out on my own - twelve thousand from mom and fourteen thousand from dad. With the money I was able to move into an off- campus apartment. I was able to breathe a little freer and since I wanted both of them to know I wasn't taking sides I made it a point to have dinner with each of them at least once a week. 

 Losing the family dynamic was only half of the hit I took. The other half came when mom and dad couldn't work out the split of the business and sold it. From the time I was fourteen my job future was assured. I would go to work full time in the family business when I graduated and eventually take it over when he retired. Suddenly that was gone and I had to figure out what I was going to do when I graduated. 

 I didn't even have a part time job anymore. The new owner reorganized and let twenty percent of the work force go and that twenty percent included all of the part time help. A good part of my classmates had a leg up on me because during their summer vacations that had interned some place and thus had links to possible future employment. The same could have been said of me, but my link had just been severed. 

 With only a month to go until graduation I started on a job search sending out resumes and checking out Internet job sites. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 There was one benefit from my parent's separation - though I would have gladly forgone it if mom and dad would have stayed together - and that was I had a place where Claudia and I (and Pauline when she came to town) could spend full nights together and wake up warm and cuddly in the morning. 

 The time we spent together did have its awkward moments like when her fiancée called and we were in the middle of making love and of course it also happened when Pauline called and I was in the saddle and going for glory. 

 We each handled it differently. When Gary called I pulled away and moved out of the room to give Pauline some privacy, but when I was Pauline calling Claudia would stay there and fondle my cock or go down on me while I talked. I did try to push her away, but I do have to admit that it was probably a half-hearted and feeble effort. Face it! How many guys are going to push away a girl who is giving you a blow job especially since only moments before you were trying to fuck each other's socks off. 

 I never called Pauline so I never interrupted her, but Claudia would call Gary and when she did I would tease her ad say things like: 

 "You think he's doing what we were doing when he called you?" 

 She would give me a dirty look and usually the finger and I would just smile and leave the room. I never did understand how she could react that way when she acted the way she did when Pauline called me. But when she hung up the phone she would come looking for me and go right for my dick. 

 ++++++++++++++++++ 

 I started getting replies to the resumes I sent out and I set up several interviews and most of them were out of state. I thought I did well in the four interviews I'd had, but none of them offered me anything; just said they would review things and let me know. 

 Three days before graduation I received a phone call from Appsolar Industries and they offered me a position. I accepted the offer even though it meant the death of Pauline's plans. Appsolar was located in St. Louis which was twelve hundred miles away. Pauline would be going to work for her father and she fully expected to take over the business when he retired. I couldn't see sustaining any kind of relationship with that much distance between us. 

 Then things got weird. 

 Even though Claudia spent a good many nights with me (3 0r 4 a week) she still had a room in the dorms. She would stop in there everyday to check for mail or messages and then would come over to my place and we would have dinner together even if she didn't spend the night. 

 I was sitting at the kitchen table going over a list of what I would need to do to move to St. Louis when she came in. "Guess what" she said as she came in the door. "I've got a job." It surprised me because as far as I knew she hadn't even been looking. Her plans, at least as far as I knew, were to graduate, get married to Gary, spend a couple of months doing nothing but relaxing from the four year college grind and playing at being a newlywed. After that she would go looking for a job. 

 She was all smiles when she came up to me, kissed me and said, "Take your clothes off. I want to celebrate." 

 "It will be a celebration for both of us. I got one today too. I do have a question for you though. Does Gary know my name or anything about me?" 

 "No. Why?" 

 "Because if he knew who I was it might be awkward if I were to run into the two of you in St. Louis." 

 "Why would you bring up something like that?" 

 "Because that is where my new job is. I'll be moving to St. Louis to go to work for Appsolar Industries." 

 Her eyes got big and she asked, "Where?" 

 "Appsolar Industries." 

 "Oh shit! This could get sticky. Really really sticky." 

 "Why?" 

 "Because that is where Gary works and that's where I'll be working too. Gary is the Manager of Human Resources and he got me a job in the Accounting department. Where are you going?" 

 "Quality Control and Vendor Support. It should be okay. As long as Gary doesn't know my name we shouldn't have a problem. All he will know is that we were classmates in some shared classes. I'll admit it will be hard to keep my hands off of you, but I can do it." 

 "God I hope so." 

 "You said something about celebrating" I said as I stood up and headed for the bedroom. Claudia followed me and it turned into a long and exhausting evening. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Pauline and I graduated on the same day so neither of us were able to attend the other's ceremony. Claudia had packed the night before and left for St. Louis right after receiving her sheepskin. I spent the evening boxing up things for the move to Missouri and about nine the phone rang. It was Pauline. 

 "Is Claudia there or is it clear for me to come over?" 

 "Claudia left for St. Louis this afternoon." 

 "Good. Be there in ten." 

 I hadn't talked to Pauine since getting my job so I figured it was going to be a bad night when she showed up and saw me packing. 

 I was right. She saw the boxes when she came in and asked: 

 "What's all of this?" 

 "Packing up to move." 

 "Move where?" 

 "St. Louis." 

 "Why in the hell would you mo...shit! That cunt Claudia! The bitch lied to me about a fiancée back home and I fell for it." 

 "No! Claudia did not get her hooks in me. The only job offer I got was in St. Louis. Claudia has nothing to do with my moving there." 

 "Maybe not, but she will be there and I won't. What about our plans? I planned on being married by the middle of August." 

 "Get serious Pauline. You have never talked to me about weddings." 

 "Bullshit Danny. You know damned well I planned on marrying you as soon as we graduated." 

 "That was your plan Pauline, but I never bought into it one hundred percent. I've always said that a lot could happen over four years of college that might change things. And a lot has happened in the four years. The biggest of them is my parent's marriage cratering. My assured job disappeared when the business was sold. I had to start looking for a job and I couldn't find one here. I sent out over sixty resumes and only got five interviews out of the bunch. Out of the five interviews I got one job offer and it is in St. Louis. I'm not against marrying you Pauline, but for it to happen you are going to have to live in St. Louis." 

 "You know I can't do that. I promised my dad that I would go to work for him if he would help pay for college. Scholarships alone wouldn't get it done and I didn't want to spend the next ten to twenty years trying to pay back student loans. I had to take his help. I have to go to work for him." 

 "That's why I've always said that things could change in four years and they have. There is nothing here in the way of work for me unless I want to flip burgers or work in a gas station convenience store and I didn't spend four years in college just to do that. I'm going to St. Louis." 

 She gave me a hard and pretty nasty look and then said, "Fuck you Danny!" and then she turned and left. 

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Two days later I was in St. Louis and apartment hunting. I found one I liked and three days later I was moved in and the day after that I started work at my new job. 

 My first day there was weird. For the first thing you want to guess who gave me my new employee orientation? Yep! None other than Gary. Naturally he commented on the fact that his fiancée had gone to the same school and I said, "Oh? What was her name?" He told me and I said that I knew her and that we had taken some classes together and then he told me that she also worked there. 

 "Great! It will be nice to have someone here that I know. It will make settling in easier." 

 "Just don't forget that she is already spoken for." 

 The very next day when I went into the breakroom to get some coffee I saw Claudia sitting at a table and I walked over and joined her. Loud enough for those sitting close enough to hear I said: 

 "Claudia! I didn't know you worked here. I never expected to see a classmate here. I remember you once saying you lived in St. Louis. Maybe you can show me around." 

 "I'm afraid my fiancée wouldn't much care for that." 

 "He won't mind a friend sitting with you here will he?" 

 "Probably not." 

 The rest of the conversation was general in nature and served to establish to those overhearing that we were just classmates who found each other working in the same place. 

 Remember I said 'first' when I said that things got weird? There was a second. My third day on the job I walked into the breakroom and saw Mandy Light sitting at a table and she wasn't alone. She was sitting with a guy and that guy was none other than Donny Haight. I was just getting ready to turn and get the hell out of there when she turned her head, saw me and cried out: 

 "Danny? Is that you?" and she was up and rushing toward me. She wrapped her arms around me and hugged me and over her shoulder I saw Haight shooting daggers at me. I also saw, off to the left, Claudia sitting at a table and taking in the whole thing. Mandy tried to get me to join her at her table, but I begged off and told her I was meeting Claudia. Mandy asked me where I was working and I told her and she told me she would catch up with me latter and she went back to her table and I headed for Claudia. 

 "Smile and pretend you are glad to see me" I said as I sat down. "I need some cover here." 

 "Not that I'm not glad to see you, but what was all that?" 

 "A past I'd just as soon forget." 

 "Oh no you don't Dan; fill me in." 

 I told her of my history with Mandy and my history with Haight and she laughed and said; 

 The Gods must love fucking with you sweetie. How else can you explain it?" 

 "All I need now is for Pauline to walk in the door" and damned if we both didn't look toward the door to see if it would happen. 

 I was pretty busy for the rest of the day learning the ins and outs of a new job so I didn't give any thought to the situation I was in. It was brought home at quitting time when I got out to the parking lot and found Mandy waiting for me by my car. She knew it was mine because I was still driving the Torino. 

 She ran up to me, threw her arms around me and kissed me. 

 "Oh God but I have missed you." 

 While she was saying that I noticed that we were pretty much the center of attention. Several cars away I saw Haight sitting in a car and scowling at me and I saw Claudia standing by her car, looking at us and laughing. Me, being the asshole I can sometimes be, I couldn't resist taking a shot at Mandy. 

 "Yeah" I said, "I noticed. Not one phone call, not one letter, no communication at all in four years. Yep. You sure missed me." 

 "Well you never made any effort to contact me either." 

 "How the hell could I? You never let me know where you were. You, on the other hand, knew exactly where I was." 

 "That's all behind us now. You are here and I don't see a ring on your finger so I'm applying for the position I had before I had to move." 

 "I'm not sure that is a good idea. I'm brand new here and I've got a lot to learn and I doubt that I'll have much in the way of free time for a while. Now if you will excuse me I need to be getting home to my apartment. I still have a lot of unpacking to do." 

 I got in my car and headed for home. I figured that since I hadn't given mandy any encouragement that would be the end of it. Silly me! I pulled up and parked at the apartment and as I was getting out of the car Mandy pulled up and parked next to me. She got out of her car and said: 

 "I can fix us some dinner while you unpack and after we eat I'll give you some special dessert." 

 I wasn't dense so I knew what she meant by "special dessert" so I said to myself, "Why fight it Dan" and I headed for my apartment. 

 Mandy was pretty much the same insatiable piece that I remembered and I didn't get any unpacking done. Didn't get dinner either. 

 We woke up together at six and had another go round before dressing for work. I followed her to a Village Inn where over breakfast I asked her how she was going to square our night together with her boyfriend. 

 "What boyfriend?" 

 "Donny Haight was looking at you rather possessively in the breakroom and later in the parking lot." 

 "He isn't my boyfriend. We did date a lot because we knew each other before we came to work here and it was easier to connect with an old friend while making new ones. He wants more and to be honest I would probably have settled for him if you hadn't come along. Now that you are here he is history." 

 I owed Haight nothing and I didn't like the asshole anyway and I wasn't dumb enough to pass up sure pussy even if I didn't think it would be going anywhere. I just said I wasn't dumb so yes, I did pick up on Mandy's "I don't see a ring so I'm applying for the position." I'm not saying for sure that it couldn't happen because people can change, but I remembered how Mandy used to bounce from guy to guy way back when. Time would tell. 

 I was a realist and I was in a new place and knew very few people and normally it would have taken months to meet people, start dating and eventually find a bed buddy, but with Mandy I had an immediate bed buddy so I went with the flow.

I was busy as hell at work that morning so I didn't spend any time thinking on the Mandy situation, but it was brought home to me when I headed for lunch. Appsolar had an employee cafeteria. I didn't notice anything until I got to the cashier and looked around for a table. That's when I noticed Mandy and Haight sitting at a table on one side of the room and Gary and Claudia sitting on the other side. I picked an empty table in the center and moved to it and sat down. Mandy got up from the table she shared with Haight, picked up her tray and walked over and sat down with me. 

 "I didn't know you would be here or I would have waited for you" she said and looking over her shoulder I saw Haight looking at me with murder in his eyes. I could have been a total asshole and smiled at him but I didn't. I did see Claudia looking our way and laughing as she leaned toward Gary and said something. 

 Back at work I was again too busy to give much thought to things, but even so I wasn't surprised to find Mandy sitting in her car next to mine when I got off work. She rolled down her window and said: 

 "Lead the way lover and I'll be right behind you." 

 That night we did take the time to eat dinner and Mandy brought me up to date. She had graduated three weeks earlier than I had and had come right to work at Appsolar. She had interned there the previous two summers and already had a job locked in before she graduated. Haight had started a week later and since they knew each other they gravitated toward each other. Haight was in Sales and Mandy was in Purchasing so they interacted with each other both on and off the job and had dated until I came on the scene. 

 Once again I must mention that I'm not dumb. I knew when she said the had dated until I got there she had more than likely ended those dates with a cock buried in her. Did I car? Not one bit. In fact I got a bit of a chuckle out of it. Back in high school when I had dumped Mandy and she had started going with Haight he used to smirk at me and I had no doubt that in his mind he was thinking that he had taken her away from me. I wondered if he was remembering that now. 

 For the rest of the week Mandy had lunch with me in the cafeteria and every lunch hour Haight was eating alone at a table and throwing dirty looks at me. Mandy no longer waited for me to get off work so she could follow me home. She just left work and drove over to my place. I'd given her a key and she was usually waiting for me to give me dessert before dinner. 

 It all came to a head on Friday. When I left work and got to my car I found Haight leaning on the left fender. As I approached he pushed off of it and planted himself in my way. 

 "I don't know what you are trying to pull asshole" he said, "But I want you to stay away from Mandy." 

 "Fuck you Haight. In case you hadn't noticed Mandy came to me; I didn't go to her. You were in the parking lot that first day when she waited by my car for me. That was her choice. The next day in the cafeteria she got up from your table and came over to mine. Again, that was her choice. I didn't come over to your table to invite her to join me. She came over and joined me so eat shit and die asswipe. You have problems with Mandy spending time with me you need to take it up with her. I suggest you get the fuck out of my way so I can go home." 

 Then he did what I expected and swung at me. I blocked it and punched him in the face. Blood spurted from his nose, his hands flew up to his face and I buried my fist in his stomach and he doubled over. 

 "Just like old times right Donny? That's the third time I've bloodied your nose. You might want to see what you can do to break the habit." 

 I pushed him out of the way and as I got in my car I noticed Claudia and Gary watching from where they were standing next to Gary's car. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Over the weekend Mandy worked hard on me to let her move in with me. By Sunday night she had convinced me that it would be a good thing so I finally agreed. Over the next week she moved all of her stuff into my place and from then on it was like we were a married couple. I know that as far as Mandy was concerned we would be getting married in the future, but I wasn't all that sure of it. 

 I still remembered how Mandy had been in the past and besides that I wasn't all that sure I wanted to get married for a while. I wanted to see where things were going with my job before making up my mind that it was a permanent thing. And I do have to admit that in the back of my mind I still thought a lot about Pauline. 

 The next three months slid by and I was getting more comfortable with the idea that I had a future at Appsolar. Mandy and I seemed to be getting along well and she was hinting that it was time for a ring. One of the reasons she wanted a ring on her finger was to give her some assurance that she was going to be my wife. 

 Why did she think she needed that assurance? Most likely because of the weekly phone calls I was getting from Pauline asking me if I'd come to my senses yet and ready to come back to her where I belonged. Even though I kept telling Pauline that I was happy with my job and wouldn't be leaving it Mandy worried that it might not be so. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Life changed again for me on the first Friday of my fifth month at Appsolar. Part of my job in Quality Control and Customer Support was traveling to visit customers to go over their requirements and handle any problems that might have cropped up in their using our products. 

 I had just finished spending the day with a customer in Dallas and was in my hotel room roughing out my trip report when my cell phone rang. It was Claudia and she wanted to know when I'd be returning and what flight I would be on. I told her and she told me that she wanted to meet me in one of the restaurants close to the airport. 

 "I need to talk with you about a problem that I have." 

 "What kind of a problem?" 

 "I don't want to get into it over the phone. One thing though; please don't tell anyone that we are meeting. You will understand why when we talk." 

 We made arrangements to meet and then said our goodbyes. The next day over Cobb salads she said: 

 "You aren't going to like hearing this, but I have to do it. I think too much of you to keep quiet about it. Mandy is cheating on you." 

 "What?" 

 "She is cheating on you big time and you need to know before yo do something stupid like marrying the whore." 

 "How do you know?" 

 "Because the guy she is cheating on you with is gary." 

 "Your fiancée?" 

 "Ex fiancée." 

 She went on to tell me the story. She was in Baltimore to do an audit on our plant there and she was supposed to be gone three days, but they finished in two and she flew home early. She walked in on Gary pounding Mandy in the butt. They were facing away from the door and didn't know that Claudia was there. She took out her cell phone, recorded the scene and turned and left. 

 "The only reason I recorded it was for insurance." 

 "Insurance? Against what?" 

 "Things could get sticky when I let the asshole know I'm dumping his ass. Given his position in the company he might just decide to do something to get me laid off or fired. My having a video of him fucking a fellow employee should make him back off. What are you going to do?" 

 "Short term? Nothing. Mandy is a great piece of ass and since we aren't married I'll keep her around until I can look around and find a likely replacement." 

 "Why waste time looking?" 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "I seem to remember that we were pretty good together." 

 "You serious?" 

 "As death and taxes." 

 "I don't know Gary, but I'm willing to bet he will be seriously pissed when you take up with me. I may need a copy of your insurance for myself." 

 "I'm letting him know tonight that he is an ex." 

 "Then I might as well let Mandy know tonight that she is history." 

 "Luckily I still have my own place even though I rarely spent a night there so all I'm going to have to do is pack the things I have at Gary's. I'm going there from here and I'll have it all in my car when he gets home and gets the news." 

 "It may take me a day or so to get Mandy out of my place. She gave up her apartment when she moved in with me and it just isn't in me to pack up all of her stuff, put it outside and tell her to take a hike. I'm not near as pissed with her as you are with Gary. We haven't talked marriage although she has dropped a hint a time or two." 

 "You have my cell number so keep me posted. Just don't dump her until I call you and tell you Gary is gone. I don't want her calling him and giving him a heads up." 

 I left the restaurant, went into work and turned in my report and expense account form and then took the rest of the day off. I stopped at a U-Haul place and bought some boxes and then went home. Once there I walked through the place and made a mental list of what would need to be boxed up and then I hit the fridge, got myself a beer and then settled in to await developments. 

 Mandy got home at 5:35 and the door hadn't even fully closed behind her when the phone rang. It was Claudia and she said: 

 "It is done." 

 "Mandy just got here so I'll get it done too." 

 "Who was that?" Mandy asked. 

 "Claudia." 

 "What did she want?" 

 "Just wanted me to know that she kicked Gary to the curb." 

 "Why would she do that? Call you I mean.' 

 "She likes me and she thought I should know." 

 "I don't understand." 

 "Simple. She walked in on you and Gary fucking and she didn't think that it was something her fiancée should be doing. She thought I should know in case I had strong enough feelings for you that I might be considering buying you a ring. She thought it was information I should have on hand when I was in the decision making process." 

 She looked at me in silence for almost a minute before saying, "I suppose you want me to move out?" 

 "I stopped at U-Haul and got some moving boxes." 

 "It wasn't hurting us any. I only did it when you were gone. I was all yours when you were here." 

 "Why did you do it in the first place?" 

 "I felt I owed him for getting me the job." 

 "Care to explain that?" 

 "We hooked up when I interned here and then the next summer when I interned again we reconnected. When it was time for me to go back to school he told me that I was the best buddy that he'd ever had and that he liked me enough to get me on full time when I graduated so we could keep on and I told him that I'd like that. He got me the job so I felt that I owed him." 

 "You should have considered that debt paid in full when you moved in with me Mandy. You can take a couple of days to get your stuff together and find a place, but you will be sleeping on the couch. Understand?" 

 She packed up all of her stuff and a day later on Saturday she moved it out into her car. As she was getting ready to leave she said: 

 "I would have stopped if we had gotten married." 

 "The time for you to have stopped was when you moved in with me not the day you were caught. I wish you good luck Mandy and I hope you have a happy life, but it won't be with me." 

 There were tears running down her cheeks when she left, but there wasn't anything I could do about it. I was probably a little young to be so cynical, but to me if she was going to run around on me while she was living with me she would probably run around on me if we were married. 

 I spent Sunday cleaning the apartment and boxing up the few things that Mandy had left behind. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 Monday Claudia stuck her head in my cubicle and said, "I don't want to eat lunch in the cafeteria for a while. Buy me lunch at the VI?" 

 "Meet you in the parking lot at twelve." 

 I was glad that she had stopped by because I really wasn't looking forward to seeing and having to avoid Mandy in the cafeteria. 

 As soon as we were in the car Claudia asked, "How did it go?" 

 "She wasn't happy, but she didn't fight it." 

 "She tell you why?" 

 "She said she felt she owed him." 

 "Whatever for?" 

 I took the recorder out of my pocket as I was saying, "I expected her to try and explain and I thought if she brought up Gary and I had what she said on tape I'd have the same kind of insurance that you have." 

 I hit the play button and she listened to what Mandy had said. She listened and then said: 

 "I can't hold what he did with her while she was an intern against him because we did have an agreement. It was that agreement that let me play with you. He knew as well as I did that the agreement was history as soon as I graduated and came home." 

 "How did he take it?" 

 "He was pissed. Said that it was really nothing for me to worry about and that it would have ended when we got married. I told him pretty much what you told her; that it should have been over when I came home. Then he told me that I might want to rethink things; that it might have an impact on my future employment. That's when I called him a low-life piece of shit and told him about the video. He called me a bitch and I laughed at him and left." 

 "I guess what we do now is avoid them as much as we can and get on with life." 

 And that is just what we did. 

 Claudia didn't move out of her place and into mine, but she did spend a hell of a lot more time at mine that she did at hers. At least she woke up more mornings at my place than she did at hers. 

 Things went along just fine for the next three months. Gary wasn't heard from and Mandy took up with Haight again and whenever we were around each other he would have a smirk on his face like he was saying "I took your woman" and I would smile at him while thinking that "You'll get yours dickhead. She'll cheat on you one of these days." 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 So Claudia and I had a good three months together and then as a famous philosopher once said, "Shit happens." 

 It was just a little after three on a Friday and I was sitting at my desk going over the report I needed to turn into my boss on my latest trip to Atlanta when my secretary (actually she wasn't mine; I shared her with three others) rang and said there was a Miss French there to see me. "What the fuck!" I thought. I hadn't heard from Pauline in almost two months. I had been hearing from her at least once a week and always it was to ask me if I was ready to come back to here where I belonged and I always told her that I was settled in at my job and wouldn't be leaving it and suddenly she stopped calling. 

 I told Alice to send her back and there she was suddenly at the entrance to my cubicle and she was as drop dead gorgeous as ever and as I stood to greet her I said: 

 "This is certainly a surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?" 

 "I finally accepted that you weren't going to come to me so I figured I'd better get off my butt and get her to you." 

 "You can't be serious." 

 "Of course I am. I've told you since high school I was going to marry you. My mother is pissed that she won't get to do the big wedding she wanted. That is she won't unless I can talk you into going back for a wedding. If not it is no big deal to me. A civil ceremony will work for me. Just find a justice of the peace and go for it." 

 And wouldn't you just know that at that exact moment Claudia walked in. 

 "Ready to go to lunch lover bunny?" and then she noticed Pauline sitting off to the side. Pauline? When did you get here?" 

 "Ten minutes ago. I came to claim my man." 

 "I can tell from the look on Dan's face he didn't know you were coming." 

 "Are you two hooked up?" Pauline asked. 

 "I think we three need to hit the restaurant at the Hilton where we can get a stiff drink or two and talk about things" Claudia said. 

 "Stiff drink. Right!" I said as I stood up. 

 When we got to the parking lot Claudia said, "Pauline will ride with me and we will meet you there." 

 I wouldn't know what to say to either one of them if they rode with me so I just said, "See you there" and got in my car. On the drive to the Hilton my mind was working in overdrive on the situation at hand. Claudia and I had a good thing going. True it was only a friends with benefits relationship and neither of us were talking about making it anything more than that. I liked Claudia a lot, but there wasn't any love there. There hadn't been any when we were in school. Some affection? Yes, but no love, none at all. 

 On the other hand I'd always liked the possibility of being married to Pauline; I'd just figured it would never happen. Not because I didn't want it, but because I'd always thought that things would change in the time we were apart. But those years were in the past and now here was Pauline coming 'to claim her man" as she had put it. 

 Of course also running through my mind was why Claudia had wanted Pauline to ride with her and just what might they be talking about? 

 I arrived first and I went in and got us a table. I was no sooner seated than the girls walked in. They were talking to each other, smiling and laughing and I didn't know if what was coming was going to be good or bad. The two of them sat down and I looked at them expectantly. Pauline read my facial expression correctly and said: 

 "After we order." 

 As if on cue the waitress walked up and took our order and then left to turn it in and as soon as she was gone Claudia said: 

 "We had a long talk on the way over here and we both know where we are on this, but what we don't know is where you are." 

 "I'm not sure of what to say here." 

 "Let me make it easy for you. Do you see what we have together since our dumping our deadwood as leading to marriage?" 

 That was an easy one for me to answer and I said, "No; not at all. Our relationship, at least from my side, was a great super-duper friends with benefits relationship." 

 "Good" Claudia said. "I'm glad we got that settled." 

 She read the look on my face and said, "That is all that it was to me too. I like you one hell of a lot, but I'm not in love with you." 

 "What that means Danny" Pauline said, "Is that there are no roadblocks keeping us from getting with the program I've had since high school. All we have to decide on is whether to turn my mother loose on setting up a wedding ordo a civil ceremony here." 

 I was never against marriage to Pauline. It was just that although I would like it I never expected it to happen. I looked from Pauline to Claudia and then back to Pauline before shrugging my shoulders and surrendering. 

 "Your call Pauline. I remember my dad once saying that a man's only role in a." wedding is to show up on time." 

 Pauline and Claudia high-fived across the table and Pauline took out her cell phone, made a call and then said: 

 "Hi mom. You're good to go. He says he will show up on time." 

 And so it came to pass. 

 The wedding took place in our home town and we honeymooned in Aruba. Two years later Jessica Marie joined us and a year and a half later Daniel Alex junior joined us. 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

 As with any story there are some loose ends that need to be tied up. 

 One was that during the planning of the wedding I found myself alone a time or two with Mrs. French and she told me why she stopped calling me. 

 "I love my husband Dan and even though he wasn't getting the job done in the bedroom I didn't want to lose him. If he was suspicious enough to put private detectives on me he would have eventually found out what I was doing and I couldn't have that. The only solution for me was to quit cold turkey before he could find out anything." 

 I smiled and told her that I understood, but that she needed to be on her guard around me and that I'd probably have a hard time keeping my hands off of her even if she was my mother in law. I was kidding of course, but I wasn't all that sure that she was when she told me she would probably have a hard time keeping hers off of me. And in fact neither of us could do it. Over the next several years whenever we were around each other and no one was looking I would fondle her tits or ass and mumble something like:  

 

 

===

"Um um good, um um good; that's what moms tits are; um um good" to the old Campbell Soups jingle substituting mom's ass or mom's tits in place of Campbell Soup. 

 She got back at me by grabbing my package and saying, "Ball Park Franks. They plump up when they are hot." 

 It was never any more than that, but I was under no illusion that under the right set of circumstances something could have happened. 

 The second thing was my relationship with Pauline's dad. He made no secret of the fact that he wasn't happy with Pauline's choice because it changed all of his plans for her and his business. He tried to sabotage the wedding by insisting on a pre-nup that would prevent me from ever having any claim to his business when he passed on and left it to Pauline. He was certain that both Pauline and I would balk at that, but we both surprised him and signed with no protest at all. 

 Pauline laughed when she told me about it. "If he dies and leaves it to me it is mine to do with what I want. If I want to sell it to you for a dollar and then work for you I can do it.' 

 It didn't matter to me one way or another. I was doing well at Appsolar and had a bright future as solar power became more and more popular and the business was constantly growing. 

 Pauline did convince her father to open another store in St. Louis and she has made a success of it. 

 Claudia found a guy that she really likes and they seem to be heading down the road that leads to the wedding chapel. 

 This tale wouldn't be complete without telling what happened to Mandy and Haight. They married about two months before Pauline and I tied the knot. They even invited me to the wedding although I did think I was done tongue in cheek. I'm guessing Mandy was in favor of sending it as a way of saying: 

 "Too bad Danny; you could have had me, but you blew it." 

 On Haight's part it was most like sent as his saying, "I took your woman asshole. Come and watch." 

 I think I surprised them both when I showed up with Pauline and even brought a present. To be honest about it I only showed up hoping to spoil the day a little for them. As I went through the receiving line and shook his hand I was thinking: 

 "I'll give you two years before she is cheating on you asshole." 

 I missed it by six months. Eighteen months into the marriage Haight came home a day early from a sales trip and found his beloved fucking her lover on what Haight considered their 'holy place.' Her lover? None other than Gary. Haight lost it and did some severe damage to both Gary and Mandy. He got jail time for it and of course lost his job, but even though in jail he sued Gary for interfering in his marriage and Appsolar for not enforcing the morals clause in their employee manual. 

 Appsolar laughed at him and said that the policy clearly stated that relations between someone in a position of authority and someone under their control was prohibited, but Gary was nowhere in Mandy's chain of command so they were not liable. He didn't get anything from Gary either although he did get a little payback (other than what got him thrown in jail) because it wasn't the first time that Gary had put the spotlight on Appsolar so the decision was made to terminate him. 

 They couldn't do anything to Mandy without being exposed to a wrongful termination lawsuit, but a lot of her coworkers were aware of why our relationship had ended and when you piled on what she did to Haight on top of it her coworkers decided that she was toxic and she was frozen out of things like stopping after work for drinks, being invited to barbecues and parties and at the company picnic and company Christmas party no one would sit with her. She eventually quit and moved away. No one has heard from her since. Report_Story
