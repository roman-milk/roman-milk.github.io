This story deals with similar themes as the stories by wannabeboytoy, seducedHylas, and Dark Betrayal, namely cheating, betrayal, and heartbreak. If stuff like that isn't your cup of tea, then you probably shouldn't bother reading it. I do not condone any of these actions in real life. This is just a story. Enjoy. 

************ 

A huge pair of breasts pressed softly into the bar. 

The woman knew exactly what she was doing as she bent over the bar, her clingy, skimpy, low-cut tank top yawing open, trying to catch the bartender's attention in more ways than one. She was dressed to impress, wearing tight, dark, form fitting jeans and stylish shoes. But it was her slim top that drew the eyes. Tight, clinging to her fit upper-half, showing off an expanse of her flat belly and sexy navel, the cream colored tank top was scooped very low, showing a near indecent amount of her round and smooth boobs, and the deep canyon of cleavage in between. The spaghetti straps were being tested by her massive rack, digging into her smooth tanned skin, while allowing her fantastic bust to be shown off to its maximum potential. She would outwardly justify this wardrobe choice as simply a countermeasure to the summer heat, but everyone knew she chose this just because it showed off her rocking DD's. She looked damn good, and she fucking knew it. 

"Can I get you something, Megan?" Zack asked, turning to face her, doing his best to keep his eyes on hers as she bent over the bar, her huge tits hanging down, showing off her deep cleavage. It was a visual delight to anyone who was looking, but luckily for Zack he was experienced with this type of thing, so it was nothing new. He kept his eyes always forward. 

"What are you offering?" the hot brunette purred, smiling wickedly at the handsome man behind the bar. 

"Well... we're a bar, and we're fully stocked. We have just about any drink you'd like," Zack replied, not acknowledging her obvious flirting. Megan was a few years older than him. She had been coming to this bar with her friends once or twice a week for a while now and she had been flirting with Zack from almost the beginning. Her friends always came across as strong, professional women and they dressed the part, but Megan wasn't afraid to dress like, quite frankly, a slut. Zack didn't really like thinking of women like that anymore, but her heavy, blunt flirting pretty much proved him right. At first, when she started coming in, her flirting was light. But her comments had progressed into being very blatant, saying things that almost made this Midwestern young man blush. Things that he was shocked she would say at all, let alone in public, surrounded and almost encouraged by her friends. But Zack was a pretty worldly guy, so it would take a lot to shock him. 

"Well, the one thing I want to drink, you won't give me," she replied, looking straight at Zack, her eyes playful, clearly savoring this interaction already. Zack looked at her for a few moments, unsure of her meaning, before she made it crystal clear. 

"I'm talking about your semen," she added bluntly. Zack reacted to this admission by panicking slightly and glancing around to make sure no one had overheard her blatant come-on. The brunette smiled brightly and continued. "I just want you to know that whenever I'm here and I'm staring at you, all I can imagine is getting on my knees and taking every single drop of cum from your swollen balls into my mouth. I would let it pool there. I would slide it all over my tongue, savoring the delicious taste, cause I can just tell you're just one of those guys who has great tasting cum. I would coat the inside of my mouth with it so I would taste it for days. Then, when I'm finally done, I would swallow every fucking drop and ask for more," she teased, her nipples hardening under her top. 

"Do you want any alcohol or not?" Zack asked, not in the mood to play games with her. She pouted slightly. 

"Why don't you ever hit on me, Zack?" Megan asked. "Guys fall all over themselves for me. Most men I come across would do anything to get in my pants. I mean, are you gay or something? What man doesn't want to suck on these tits? No man's will is that iron. I mean, you don't even have the decency to check out my huge boobs! I can't tell you how happy it would make me if I caught you staring at my cleavage. That alone would give me so much mental fuel. I would literally finger myself to that for months without it getting old," she told him, loving the heated and filthy nature of this, unfortunately, one-sided seduction. 

"A guy would have to be gay to resist your charms?" Zack replied bluntly. "You're telling me that all guys just fall entranced by your sparkling personality? Or, maybe, just maybe, not every guy is looking for what you are offering..." he explained, not giving her an inch, unimpressed by her heavy handed seduction. 

"One day, I might just start going to a different bar, where the bartenders are far more willing to play. And when I do, you're gonna really regret missing out on this," she said, gesturing towards her hot body. Zack's eyes were drawn downward for a moment, unconsciously following her hands, his eyes taking in her luscious frame for a moment before catching himself, bringing his gaze up from her delicious boobs to her eyes again. "Ah! Had you there for a second! You see, Zack, deep down, you want this. You'd better take advantage before I'm out of your life for good." 

"Well, I can't wait for that day to come," Zack replied simply, happy simply at the thought of not having to deal with her again. She smiled at him, loving the hunt, feeling the thrill of the chase. Zack had resisted her far longer than any other man. Most others had given in, but not him. And that level of willpower made him absolutely irresistible to the hot-bodied seductress. 

She reached across the bar and put her hand on his arm, but he pulled away. She had gotten very handsy lately. At one point, when he was out from behind the bar, she announced her presence to him by palming his cute butt, digging her nails into him roughly. He didn't appreciate the invasion of his person then, and he really didn't now. 

"Ah, who am I kidding?" She began. "I love the chase. When you and I finally do it, and believe, some day, we ARE gonna do it, it's gonna be so worth the wait..." Zack didn't respond, leaving her to fill in the silence. 

"Don't make me have to go home empty handed, Zack. I'm not asking for a relationship here. I just want you to come back to my place so we can screw each others' brains out," she said with a sickeningly sweet smile. He didn't say a word so she continued. "I don't understand why everyone gets so hung up on casual sex. Zack... just let me show you a good time. You've earned it." Megan urged softly. "And you know that I would show you a very good time." 

"Again, Megan, not interested. Now do you want a drink or not?" Zack asked, impatient, deftly denying her as other customers were backing up at the bar. 

"Whiskey. Straight-up," she relented, pouting. As he turned to grab the bottle, she let her eyes gaze across his impressive frame. She admired his cute butt. His fit torso. His strong, sturdy arms. His broad back. Even though he was so calm and even-keeled, an experienced seductress like her could just tell this guy would be an absolute beast between the sheets. She often fantasized about being on the receiving end of the lustful fury hidden behind his cool façade. 

"You might as well give up, Megan." Zack began, "Hate to break it to you, but I'm engaged. Someone came up to this bar and beat you to it, did what you couldn't," he teased, smiling back at her, knowing this would infuriate Megan, while hoping it would end her fascination with him. She grabbed her drink from him and slammed it, before looking at him coolly. 

"Does she have tits like these?" she said, her tone slightly less playful, cupping her mammoth jugs, pointing them at him. He couldn't help but glance at her rack for a moment, taking in their smooth, perfect round shape, but he looked away calmly, confident enough to see what she was offering and still be unaffected. 

"She has something you don't," Zack replied easily, denying the aggressive, hot-bodied vixen at every turn. 

"She must be a lucky girl," she replied, staring him down, anger behind her eyes. "But engaged isn't married, and take it from me, a ring is simply a target to women like me. This will never stop for you, Zack. If it's not me, it'll be another woman. Trust me," she warned him knowingly. 

"I have other customers... and your friends are looking bored," Zack replied, looking to step away from the seductress. 

"Can I at least get your number?" she asked, "In case things with your girl don't work out, and you're in desperate need of some hot, tight cunt?" Zack bristled slightly at her rough language. 

"I think I'm good," Zack replied with a knowing look. She nodded her head, sadly receiving the answer she expected at this point. 

"That's probably for the best," she admitted. "The things I'd do if I had your phone number..." she paused wistfully. "I'd make taking pictures of naked tits a fucking art form." Zack's eyes widened slightly, again wowed by how blunt and honest she was being. 

"You done?" he asked. She gave him a hard, pointed look before relenting. 

"Well..." she began, reaching into her small purse, "If you change your mind, here's my card," she said, handing him a business card. She gave him one last, lingering look before stepping away, shaking her butt at him pointedly, the straps of her black thong riding proudly over her hips, forming an indecent whale-tail, displaying the tiny undergarment without shame. But Zack didn't linger on her or the card in his hand. Zack didn't even glance at it before dispensing it into the trash. Women like Megan didn't really faze him anymore. 

This wasn't an uncommon occurrence for Zack. In fact, the other bartenders teased him for it, some of the other guys not understanding what made him so irresistible to the female clientele. The female bartenders and staff totally got his appeal, but they had the respect for him and his relationship status that those other women didn't. 

The Zack of old would have happily welcomed this behavior in the female customers, but he had evolved beyond that type of thing. Despite their obvious appeal, he had grown enough to not gawk like a horny teenager. He wasn't blind to it, certainly. He totally understood how hot and sexy women like Megan were, but a guy like Zack had pretty much seen everything. He had seen big boobs. Very big boobs. He had seen full, round, juicy asses. He had done some filthy things with women, things you don't do with women you respect and love, but that stuff was all out of his system now. He didn't need a pair of massive, soft, juicy breasts. He didn't need a tight, round and fit ass to make him happy. He wasn't that guy anymore. He was ready to settle down and be with someone for the right reasons. He needed a lot more than what Megan offered. 

He was good. He was happy. He had Mandy, and she was all he needed. 

He couldn't wait for the wedding. He couldn't wait to get married. He couldn't wait to have the privilege of taking Mandy as his wife, and he couldn't wait for her to do allow him the honor of being her husband. 

Despite what all his buddies would tell him, the idea of settling down and getting married sounded very appealing to Zack. It sounded like just what he needed to be perfectly content and happy. 

He couldn't wait. 

************* 

Like many women before her, Mandy Robbins was realizing that the idea of marriage was a lot more appealing than the reality of making it happen. What had started as a simple, humble event was suddenly turning into the wedding from hell. 

The big day was quickly approaching and things were happening fast. She would carry a notebook around filled with all the arrangements and important information for the wedding just in case something arose and she needed to know some information at a moment's notice. She thought she had everything all set but she wasn't the type to rest on her laurels. She would check things over and over again, but even for someone like her, she was starting to feel pretty good about how the arrangements were coming along. With the wedding only a few weeks' away, Mandy figured things should be pretty much set at this point, but that wasn't the case for her. On the contrary, things were pretty much falling apart. 

"What do you mean you can't find my order?" Mandy said on the phone, losing her cool. As she sat at her desk at work and listened to the caterer explain to her that her arrangements had somehow vanished, Mandy began to panic. "My wedding's in three weeks! I can't find another caterer on this short of notice! Wait... it's gonna cost me how much to re-submit my order? I... I can't afford that! I mean, I put my order in months ago!" 

A few minutes later, Mandy's head was in her hands after she angrily slammed the phone down. She didn't know what she was gonna do. Things had seemed like they were going well, but it seemed like all of a sudden in these last few days all of her plans were getting thrown out the window. She rubbed her forehead in consternation. Things couldn't fall apart now. They couldn't! 

She had done everything right. Mandy was a very detail oriented person, and organizing this wedding seemed to fit perfectly with this side of her. She had started on everything months in advance, not wanting to procrastinate. She was very good about checking her arrangements over multiple times, verifying that things were running smoothly. Getting everything in place was tricky. Trying to find a good place for flowers, and catering, and a good church; it wasn't easy, especially in the big city. But she was happy with what she had put together. 

Neither her nor her husband-to-be were exactly raking it in, so they were working on a limited budget. And that was fine, cause Mandy wasn't the type of girl to need pomp and circumstance. Sure, that kind of stuff seemed good in fantasy, but the young secretary was aware enough to know that that kinda stuff wasn't very realistic. 

Typically, she liked to stay after work when she had to make some important calls pertaining to her wedding. It was usually after her boss and most of the others had left, preferring to conduct the business there as opposed to at her apartment. She liked doing things at work because she tried to avoid bringing this madness home with her. She was doing this on her own time so no one could be too upset, and typically, the people still around past closing time were too absorbed in their own business to take notice of her. But now, as she confronted the fact that all of her plans were falling apart, she regretted taking care of her personal business in this setting. At this point, she wanted to be far away from prying eyes. And, on top of that, this happened to be one of the few days that her boss had stuck around beyond her normal leaving time. And of course, just as she was feeling this wave of panic as her perfectly laid plans fell through, her boss, Vanessa Jones, the CEO of Tredex Enterprises, emerged from her office. 

"Mmm, good, you're still here," Vanessa said, stepping out of her office. "I need to get a hold of Tori K in the morning. I need to tell her to get her man in line so we can do some business together." The older African-American woman sauntered towards Mandy, looking every bit the high powered executive she was, her slim, leather skirt and her tight, silky blouse hugging her voluptuous form. Her small black designer purse was hanging off her shoulder, and her fashionable aviator-style sunglasses were poised at the end of her nose. As she began to walk past her seated secretary, her high heels clicking on the floor, she didn't immediately taking notice of her secretary's plight. It was only when she noticed her secretary's lack of response that she glanced down at her and noticed her head in her hands. 

"What's wrong?" Vanessa asked. While Vanessa had a soft spot for her young secretary and often gave her advice and discussed the young woman's professional future, things between them were typically very business-like, centering mostly on professional matters, so it was unusual for her to inquire too much into Mandy's personal matters. 

"Uhh... well," Mandy began, angrily smiling, "Firstly, the florist for my wedding decided to double his price. The photographer just disappeared off the face of the Earth, and now, my order with the caterer up and vanished. I... my wedding is falling apart!" She said, feeling tears welling in her eyes, but she tried to stop herself. She would not let herself cry at work. She wasn't one of those girls. 

Not knowing what to say at first, Vanessa looked at Mandy's desk, noting the open folder with Mandy's wedding plans. Being a veteran of many marriages, this caught her eye, so she shifted her focus away from her panicked secretary onto that. 

"Let me take a look at this..." Vanessa said, moving her sunglasses on top of her head and leaning over the desk. Mandy moved aside to give her boss some room. As she did, Mandy couldn't help but let her eyes lock onto Vanessa's jiggling breasts as she bent over the desk. This happened a lot, and not just with Mandy, but with lots of people. Vanessa's breasts were absolutely enormous, looking even more huge due to her fit frame. And it wasn't unusual to catch someone in the office gawking at her massive black breasts. Mandy surmised that Vanessa secretly welcomed this kind of attention, with some of the low-cut tops she wore, but since Mandy worked in close proximity to her, she tried her best to not let them catch her eye. Mandy was 100% straight, it wasn't anything like that. They were just perfectly round and smooth and absolutely huge. It was difficult not to stare, man or woman. Her boobs were just amazing! 

In Mandy's current state, the size of her boss's breasts was only a momentary distraction as Vanessa glanced over Mandy's wedding plans with surprising interest. She glanced through each perfectly separated section in Mandy's folder, evaluating her choices for the church, flowers, catering, photographer, etc. As she did, she muttered to herself. 

"No... no... no," she said, shaking her head at Mandy's choices. "Oh, Mandy... you really should have brought me in on this earlier," she said softly to herself, with a slight sense of judgment. "I'm sorry, but these choices are pretty rough. The florist you chose is garbage, the caterer is a well-known rip-off artist, and the church you chose is not one you want to get married in. What compelled you to choose these?" she asked, looking down at her seated secretary, who had never felt so small. 

"I... I..." Mandy stammered, her cheeks beet red as she rubbed her forehead. 

"You clearly did your research... why did you decide on... these?" Vanessa asked, tearing down Mandy's decision making as she would with some incompetent subordinate in the boardroom. This harsh judgment, combined with her already boiling frustration, finally caused Mandy to boil over. 

"Well, maybe if you paid me more, I could have afforded better!" Mandy said loudly at her boss, catching Vanessa off guard. Only a second later, horror flashed across her face at the realization of what she had just said hit her. "Oh my God, I am so sorry. I didn't mean that!" Mandy stammered. Vanessa looked down at Mandy with an unreadable expression for a moment, causing Mandy to panic and think she was about to get fired on the spot. Then, Vanessa smirked, with almost a bit of pride. 

"Ooohh, shy little thing has some fire in her belly! I like that!" Vanessa said, causing Mandy to exhale in relief.  

===

"I'm sorry... it's just, this is all happening at once, and it's all so fast, and I've got no one to help out..." Mandy said, everything hitting her at once as she felt the tears welling in her eyes once more. Vanessa studied her young secretary for a moment before coming to a decision. 

"I tell you what, come into my office. Let me make some calls." Mandy followed her boss into her large office. Vanessa dropped her bag unceremoniously onto the floor and tossed her sunglasses onto the side couch. As Vanessa sat behind her large oak desk and skimmed through her leather notebook full of phone numbers, Mandy sat in front of the desk, not sure what to expect. Vanessa rolled up her sleeves, cracked her neck, and picked up the phone. 

For the next hour, she watched her boss do in an hour what had taken Mandy months. Using her knowledge of the city and her many connections, she had rearranged everything, using her sway to get new expensive caterers, one of the best florist's in the city, a highly regarded photography company, a new banquet hall for the reception and a new church, which was one of the oldest and in-demand wedding spots in the city. Every time Mandy tried to speak up, Vanessa would silence her with a mere wave of her hand. Mandy was in a panic, thinking this was all way beyond her budget, but when she brought it up, Vanessa said simply, "Don't worry about it.", seemingly implying that she would be footing the tab. 

Mandy had occasionally been with Vanessa in the boardroom before and seen her at work, but it was as she made these calls that she truly saw what had allowed Vanessa to rise to where she was now. She was firm and imposing when she had to be, and smooth and charming when she had to grease the wheels. It was clear that Vanessa was enjoying this process as well, as any exhaustion she might have felt at the end of a long work week was gone. Her perfectly presented look became slightly mussed the longer she was on the phone, her blouse becoming untucked, a few hairs of her perfectly styled hair moving slightly out of place, a button on her top becoming undone, and a bit of sweat forming on her brow. But an hour or so later, when she hung up the phone after booking the new church, she finally sat back and smiled at her young secretary, her work done. 

"Ms. Jones, I... I don't know what to say. I mean, like I said, I can't afford any of this, and that church is just amazing... But it's too big, and too fancy, and we don't have that many people coming..." Mandy stammered. 

"Mandy, like I said, I'll cover it... consider it a wedding gift." Vanessa replied. Mandy was blown away. While Vanessa was always kind to her, she didn't think Vanessa particularly liked her this much. And plus, she wasn't even coming to the wedding. How could this be happening? 

"It's too much... I can't accept that." Mandy said, her Midwest sensibilities not allowing her to accept this gift outright. 

"Nonsense." Vanessa said, waving her hand at Mandy dismissively. "Hon, I've got more money than I know what to do with. Don't worry, I'll be fine. And besides... I like you Mandy. I sense something in you. You're young and you're shy, but you've got strength in you. You're tough, and trust me, as someone who's been in business for a long time, us girls have to stick together." Vanessa explained with a warm tone, her velvety voice soothing her worries. Mandy exhaled, and smiled at her older boss, finally accepting the gift from her. 

"I don't know how I'm gonna fill up that church." Mandy said with a laugh. 

"Oh, don't worry about that. I know some people who are happy to show up at any event where I'm picking up the check. We'll make it a big event. Trust me, there won't be an empty seat." Vanessa said confidently. Not being able to find the words to express her immense gratitude, emotion finally began to overwhelm Mandy. She put her head in her hands as tears began to pour from her eyes. Vanessa smiled warmly as her young secretary began sobbing into her hands. Vanessa stood up, her heels clicking on the floor as she approached her. Mandy looked up and smiled at her boss standing over her, spreading her arms invitingly. Mandy smiled through her tears as she stood and hugged her boss. She couldn't help but notice Vanessa's massive boobs pressing into her own slim chest as they hugged, but as her boss patted her on the back warmly the only thing running though her mind was relief. 

As the hug finished and Mandy stepped back, she looked up at her boss with affection. 

"Thank you so much," Mandy said, as Vanessa gave her some tissues to wipe her tears away. "This has been so hard and I don't have many people to talk to about this... I can't say thank you enough! I really, truly appreciate it!" 

"No problem, honey. I think I've put together a pretty amazing wedding for you. I look forward to it." Vanessa said. 

"So, you're gonna be there?" Mandy asked, knowing she had been told previously she was too busy to attend. 

"Hey, I put this whole thing together, I've got to see it through." Vanessa replied with a warm smile. 

"Thank you... again," Mandy replied. 

"Now, you talk to me if any of these people start giving you some shit. I'll kick them into shape." Vanessa said. 

"Totally," Mandy said. 

"And you keep me in the loop. As you're unofficial wedding planner, I want to be in the know on everything." Vanessa said. 

"Of course. Totally." Mandy said. 

"Now..." Vanessa said, moving to retrieve her sunglasses, "If you'll excuse me, I do have to get going. I have a very hot date with a very hot doctor who I plan to do some very bad things to, so..." Mandy stepped aside as Vanessa stepped past her, before bending down to retrieve her purse. As she did, Mandy couldn't help but notice the tiny, solid yellow thong appearing above the hem of her skirt, pulled up over her hips in an obscene whale-tail. Mandy surmised that Vanessa's doctor friend was in for a very good time. 

As they stepped out of the office together, Mandy thanked her boss again before departing. She was amazed at how kind her boss was being, especially considering her reputation. Vanessa Jones was known as a fierce, cutthroat businesswoman, but at this point Mandy had nothing but warm feelings for her boss. She was forever grateful for her boss's help and kindness, and for the first time Mandy saw Vanessa as something of a mother figure. No matter what happened, Mandy would think warmly of Vanessa. 

That feeling was about to be tested. 

************* 

For the next few days, Mandy was walking on air. The many obstacles she had faced, things were finally beginning to work out. Fate was finally beginning to be kind, thanks to Vanessa. This made her think about her journey to this point, how she came to work for the notorious Vanessa Jones. 

Initially, Mandy was told to be afraid of her boss. When she started at Tredex Enterprises as a lower tier assistant, she had been told to steer clear of the CEO, to stay away from Vanessa Jones. But for someone in Mandy's position at the time, it wasn't like they were running into each other often. Vanessa was on a whole other level of existence it seemed. 

Mandy's job was to help out whoever she was assigned to, taking notes, delivering paperwork, boring stuff like that. The company itself was a very competitive environment, as they handled the logistics of handling products from the factory to the shelf. The sales team was in charge of finding the cheapest and most efficient modes of shipment, as well as selling the products to the big chain stores. Success was dictated by who brought in the biggest savings and the highest profits. The sales team was hyper-competitive, and the work environment could be rather tense. 

Whether she knew it or not, Mandy Robbins was built to last within this competitive environment. She was an extremely shy, quiet girl, and her attitude towards her job was to simply keep her head down and do what she was asked. She stayed out of conflict and did her best to help out wherever she could. She had no background in this line of work. She had only applied because it was the first job listing that popped up on the job website she used. 

Mandy had had a rough upbringing. Her parents had died in a car accident when she was young, and she was raised by her grandmother. Living with her grandmother instead of her younger, more vibrant parents limited the kinds of things she was able to do in her youth. So, Mandy became very quiet and bashful. She was super nice and friendly when called upon, though she never jumped out from the crowd. She was pretty, but the type of pretty that grows on you. Her pale complexion, her frumpy red hair, and her plain wardrobe meant she never really made a mark in school. People knew her and were nice to her, but she didn't have many real true friends. 

Mandy's grandmother had passed soon after her high school graduation, so Mandy was on her own with no real support system. Mandy didn't have the money to go to college, so although she was a very bright girl and a great student her options were limited. That is part of the reason why she moved to the big city. She was a young woman looking for a fresh start in a new location that was bustling with opportunity. It was a tough job search, but it eventually paid off. So despite the warnings about the big boss and that innate feeling that she didn't belong with all these high rolling business people, she knew she had to stick it out at Tredex. She had gotten her foot in the door and she'd be a fool not to let things play out. And it actually worked out for the best. Her quiet and eager-to-please demeanor allowed her to gain a good reputation around the building. She steadily climbed the ladder, working as an assistant for some bigger figures in the company. Her reputation grew until, eventually, she had caught the eye of Vanessa Jones. Before she knew it, Mandy was applying to work alongside the company's CEO. Despite being told to steer clear of the big boss, she was now being offered to work directly alongside her. 

Mandy was filled with a lot of trepidation when she waited to be interviewed by Vanessa. The rep she had been working for had retired, leaving Mandy floating, not sure where her services would go, until she was called by HR and told she had an interview with Vanessa Jones the next day. Mandy nearly dropped her phone when she heard this. Then she steeled herself, calmed her nerves and made sure to be ready at 8 AM to talk with the big bad CEO for the first time. But despite her best efforts, as she sat in Vanessa's office waiting for her to enter, she found herself kind of completely terrified. So it was no surprise that when the door opened behind her Mandy jumped in her seat. She smoothed her gray, department store skirt and turned to face Vanessa Jones. 

Mandy had seen Vanessa around a few times, and it quickly became clear she was the woman she had heard the horror stories about. Vanessa Jones was a 42-year- old African-American woman when they first met, and she was very, very intimidating. She had started out in sales, and her forceful, aggressive personality made her an immediate success. In business and in life, she was a bulldozer, intimidating her rivals, bowling them over, making them too scared to do anything but give her exactly what she wanted. Within a few years of starting in the company, she was running the place. And while she definitely ruffled some feathers, and she certainly wasn't always the most popular person around, her success couldn't be argued with. Under her guidance, the company had gone from simply having some small, humble success to being internationally known and widely regarded as the best in its field. They collaborated with many well-known companies, as well as being brought in to help smaller companies distribute their products. And in doing so, they raked in the cash. Under Vanessa's leadership, they ascended from having a small, humble stand-alone building to now working within multiple floors in a skyscraper. People in the business world, old money mainly, were surprised that this black woman could have such success in a mainly white world. Then they met her and figured out why people fell in line with her. Vanessa's methods weren't always for the weak at heart, but they were definitely effective. 

As much as Vanessa's persona was forceful and intimidating, her looks and body were even more so. Her intense beauty combined with her demanding personality made her a very imposing woman. She had done some modeling in her younger years, and it showed. Her skin was a rich, dark chocolate brown, smooth and sexy and luscious. Her hair hung in smooth curls down her back, always perfectly styled. Her eyes were almond shaped and striking, her hazel irises perfectly complimenting them, and her perfectly groomed eyelashes made her gaze alluring. Her lips were plump and smooth and naturally formed a slight sneer. Her face was elegant and striking in its beauty, making it clear why she was a model in her younger years. And it was clear she could still model, cause even at 44, she was absolutely gorgeous. Age had not done a number on her yet, as her face was wrinkle free. Vanessa could still be on magazine covers and her looks would still blow away all those younger bitches. 

Her beauty was striking, but it was her body that was that made her truly imposing. Her frame was very fit, showing off the fact that her disciplined fitness schedule payed off. Despite her fitness, she maintained her luscious curves. She constantly wore tight, body hugging business suits, her tight pants hugging her long firm legs and showing off her juicy, sexy thighs, trim calves and her round imposing ass. Vanessa had a grade-A, top-shelf rear-end. It jutted out from her luscious frame. Her ass was so large and round, each cheek so firm and juicy, even the cleft between the cheeks was alluring and sexy. Her butt could make a grown man weep. The rest of the body held up to the high standards of her lower half. Her stomach was fit and sexy and her arms were lithe and firm. And her most important feature, other than her sexy round ass, were, of course, her big round tits. 

Vanessa Jones had enormous breasts. Just, like, absolutely enormous. Vanessa's mammoth jugs were her secret weapons in the boardroom, allowing her to both intimidate less endowed women, as well as dominating men's attention. She couldn't count the amount of times that those guys, those old money guys who protested a woman 'like her' being in a position of power, she caught their eyes falling into her deep, black cleavage. And when caught in that lustful gaze, it made business rivals a lot more open to do business. They were just so eye-catching that even the most professional business rival, man or woman, would find them just impossible not to stare at. The massive, round, smooth FF cups on her chest were simply mammoth. And she knew how to use them. Not only were they weapons in the boardroom, they were weapons in the bedroom as well. 

Her love life was the stuff of legend. She had been married four times. The first one was when she was younger, an engagement to an older, successful businessman that gave her only child, a daughter. Needless to say, with her husband's great wealth, the divorce paid out well, and she parlayed the contacts she made when married to advance her career. Her second marriage was a volatile one, a short-lived relationship to a basketball player, and the divorce was very public and messy. Her third marriage was to a wealthy real- estate developer, and this marriage went pretty well, but as her fourth husband also found out, carrying out a long-term relationship with Vanessa was nearly impossible. She was such a dominant force, that dealing with her on a day-to- day basis, as well as hearing the rumors of her many naughty exploits, led to those relationships being torpedoed. It was either submit to her will or run, and most of these guys were simply too proud to let Vanessa dominate their lives. 

Unfortunately for Vanessa, her stature limited her choice of men, and her reputation seemed to follow her. The men she encountered that were on her level were either too intimidated by her gorgeous looks and hot body, or they knew enough of her history to keep away from her. So, with her romantic life stagnating, she threw herself into her work, doubling down on her intensity. She had driven her last assistant away into retirement and she was in need of another one immediately. 

You would think that Mandy would be a bad match for Vanessa. The older woman was intense and aggressive and all business, and the younger woman was shy and demure and unassuming. Vanessa noted the contrast upon glancing at the young woman during the interview. Mandy's nerves were apparent to the older black woman. Vanessa smiled lightly when she saw the young woman in front of her, shaking like a leaf. Vanessa knew she could destroy the poor girl in an instant with a single harsh phrase, but a funny thing happened. 

Vanessa took pity on her. 

Vanessa was intense in business, but she had a smooth, charismatic charm, and a surprisingly generous heart. Vanessa hadn't forgotten her humble beginnings, and looking at the young woman, and hearing a bit of her story, Vanessa saw a bit of herself in young Mandy. The young woman was a good worker, sure, but Vanessa typically favored people with a bit more experience. Less magnanimous people could take advantage of the young woman's quiet nature, but Vanessa wasn't wired like that. She knew that in the male-dominated business world, girls had to stick together, so instead of shoving this young woman away, Vanessa vowed to build her up. Make something of the young wallflower. 

Mandy nearly cried when Vanessa gave her the job, and in that moment, she vowed to be the best assistant the older woman had ever had. 

************** 

In the two years Mandy had been working for Vanessa her confidence had only grown. Working alongside the experienced businesswoman, she had grown to greatly admire her. Even though Mandy greatly appreciated her late grandmother and the work she had put in to raise her, she was never the vivacious, worldly figure that Vanessa was. Vanessa was the strong, vibrant feminine role model she always wished she had. 

She had seen Vanessa at work, and seen her powerful demanding side in the boardroom. But, in their personal interactions, Vanessa was very patient and kind. The older woman had a soft spot for Mandy. Vanessa was always teaching her, giving her the knowledge she needed to grow from a shy young girl to a self-assured confident woman. 

And it had paid off. 

Mandy had branched out in life, getting out there, no longer being satisfied with spending her Friday nights alone watching reality TV. She had made some friends, had some fun and made some mistakes, the type of things a 25-year-old should be doing. And for the first time in her adult life, she had a man. 

His name was Zack. 

Mandy had always dreamed of being part of some crazy love story like in the movies, but she never thought it could actually happen. But... it had. She had gone out to a bar in the city, and while her friends' eyes were on the morass of people with drinks in their hands, scoping out for any possible winners among them, Mandy's eyes were on the bartender. Not only because he was a hunk, but also because she recognized him. 

Zack Wade wasn't just a bartender. Mandy knew him from back home, thousands of miles away. They had gone to high school together, and while she was the wallflower, he was the popular guy. He was the guy who the girls flocked to. He was the guy who all the guys wanted to be best friends with. To put it simply, in high school, he was THAT guy. And while Mandy would freely admit that she barely knew Zack, they knew each other enough that whenever they would run across each other, he would give her a friendly cute smile and nod, and she would respond in kind, but in a far more nervous, less cool manner.  

===

So when Mandy saw him again, as a bartender in the big city, those old nerves reappeared. Part of her just wanted to get away, not wanting to be recognized by this guy she used to idolize. She kept herself turned away, trying to avoid being seen. But when a drink appeared in front of her, on the house, courtesy of the bartender, she found herself turning to face him. When he gave her that same, cute smile and nod, Mandy melted. 

Mandy made her way to the bar and struck up a conversation with Zack, catching up. Mandy was shocked at how interested he seemed to be in talking to her. A guy as popular as him didn't need to spend any time with a girl like her, but he genuinely seemed interested. She found herself at the bar talking to him for hours, well after her friends had left. She and Zack had an easy chemistry, their conversation flowing easily without a single lull. Mandy was shocked to find herself exchanging numbers with Zack, but with her history with men, she thought this was simply a token gesture, not expecting anything to come from it. She was just a friendly face in the big city, and maybe they would hang out once or twice. He was handsome and popular... why would he want to hang out with a boring girl like her? 

Despite this feeling, she found a tentative text from him a few days later. Conversation was started. Jokes were made. And soon enough, they found themselves making plans to meet again. Before she knew it, Mandy and Zack were dating. It didn't feel real to her. She was somehow dating the guy who was the most popular guy in school. It was a dream come true. Sure, it was seven years later, seven years beyond those silly high school days, but judging by his looks, it was still a fantastic accomplishment. 

Zack still looked the part of the good Midwest boy. He was handsome and strong and sturdy. He didn't have a gym body, with overblown showy muscles. His muscles were real muscles, thanks to his work outdoors, and his strong work ethic in general. His sturdy frame made him a success on the football field in his high school days, but despite his success there he didn't see a future in athletics. He had dreams of making a career in the arts, specifically acting, which is why he made his way to the big city, looking for a break. With his looks, Mandy would have figured he would have been a huge success. He had short shorn, dirty blonde hair. His face was adorned with a short, perfectly trimmed beard, adding to his manly, rugged aura. Combine that with his striking blue eyes, his cute smile, perfect teeth, and those small dimples on his face, it seemed like he was a star in the making. But success hadn't come to him quite yet, so he made a living bartending. 

Mandy really admired his attitude, as he never let his failures get him down. Even if the success he dreamed about never found him, she just knew Zack wouldn't let that get him down. He didn't need that type of validation to be happy, and Mandy knew that he would be perfectly satisfied with a humble existence. He didn't need the world. He didn't need to become a big Hollywood star. He just wanted the simple things. Maybe that's why he didn't choose some model or hot babe to date. Maybe that's why he chose a girl like her. 

Despite Mandy's low self-confidence, Zack seemed to take a strong liking to her. He seemed so enthused to be around her. At times, he seemed almost as nervous as she was. Mandy knew he had had an active dating life in his younger days, but he admitted to her that he was happy to be with someone who had a lot more substance than those other girls. Hearing this filled her with warmth and affection for him, and she had to stop herself from letting things move too fast with him. With her level of experience in relationships, and her immediate intense attraction to Zack, it took all the willpower she had to stop herself from getting physical with him too fast, despite every fiber of her being telling her otherwise. If years of advice from her friends, family, and movies had taught her anything, it was best to take things slow, despite how badly she wanted it. And she did want it badly. 

Mandy's patience with him was well-received, and Zack was a complete gentleman. In a sense, he liked that he had to wait with her. He respected her convictions and patience, and the fact that she wasn't just rushing into bed, like all the other girls he had been with, made him like her even more. It never felt right to him to hop into bed with a girl on the first date, or even within hours of meeting her, as had happened a few times. He certainly never spoke out and slowed things with those other girls, mind you, but having Mandy want to take things slowly with him was downright refreshing. He sensed her inexperience and didn't mind it, so when things eventual did get physical, he was patient and gentle with her, not making things overly rushed and lusty, as it was with the girls he used to date. 

As time went on, their relationship only got stronger and deeper. It honestly felt like a fairy tale, the handsome hunk from high school reconnecting with class wallflower and discovering how much he liked her. It was almost like a dream. 

Their relationship was very strong. The young couple complimented each other well. He pushed her out of her little bubble, making her experience things she had never dreamed of doing. And she was endlessly supportive of his artistic pursuits, and the genuine excitement she expressed at even his smallest accomplishments filled him with love for her. Eventually, he made the decision to propose. When he made the move, the tears that poured down her cheeks let him know he made the right call. Of course, she accepted, and when she leapt into his arms, she thanked him for making her dreams come true. 

*************** 

Mandy and Zack sat together in their shared apartment at about 10:00 on a Saturday night. Both were sitting on the floor, with Mandy sitting between Zack's legs as he sat against the front of the couch. They were supposed to be watching this new TV show Zack had read about. Zack was a big movie and TV guy, so he had really good taste in media and finding good stuff that no one had heard about. And while the Danish sci-fi show they were watching was good, Mandy was struggling to pay attention. She was sorting through wedding stuff, pressed up against Zack's chest. His arms were wrapped around her waist, and he was resting the side of his face against her head as she wrote purposefully in her notebook. He tried to pay attention to the show, but he couldn't help but keep one eye on her and what she was doing. 

"You should relax," he whispered into her ear. 

"Well, I... I appreciate all of Vanessa's help, but it's kind of complicated things," Mandy replied, not looking up from her work. 

She was telling the truth. It was easy for Vanessa to swoop in and save the day, but Mandy was forced to deal with the fallout. Mandy was, of course, eternally grateful to Vanessa, but because of that Mandy felt a certain deference to her boss in some of the decisions she made, no matter if they complicated things. Vanessa had roped in a lot of people into coming to this, and it was up to Mandy to figure out how to arrange them both in the church and at the reception. Plus, Vanessa had completely changed up the color scheme of the whole wedding, finding Mandy's choices, the colors she had had in mind for her wedding since she was a child, dull and unsophisticated. So, instead of a soft green themed wedding, the colors were now a sharp gold and black. Because of that, she had to make last minute changes with all the bridesmaids' dresses, with Vanessa picking up the check, again. It was doable, but it was a complication. Also, she almost felt compelled to invite Vanessa into the bridal party, and when she mentioned this to her friend Lacey, who was her maid of honor, Lacey herself said that she had to make Vanessa her maid of honor. She was paying for everything, so in all of the bridesmaids' minds she had bought her way into being the maid of honor. So, Vanessa was now Mandy's maid of honor. It wasn't a bad thing, just a new wrinkle. Mandy was trying to balance all this stuff out in a short amount of time, and it wasn't easy. 

Mandy and Zack had scoped out the new church and the fancy new location for the reception. Both seemed in awe, as both seemed way too fancy for the humble little couple, but it was what was being given to them, so they weren't gonna complain too much. The only thing Mandy was really gonna complain about was the awkward experience they had at the reception location. Zack beat Mandy there, as Mandy was scoping out the flowers, and Zack had finished up meeting with the photographers quicker than Mandy had been able to finish. When she got there, she stumbled on her fiancé being chatted up by the representative of the people who were hosting the reception, who happened to be this hot little number named Trina, a slim, but stacked Asian woman who was hot and she knew it. She was well dressed and professional, but her top just coincidentally hugged her large breasts, and just happened to be very low-cut, exposing her deep, creamy cleavage. Her skirt was slim and hugged her lithe legs and her round, firm ass. 

Mandy watched from out of sight for a few minutes, watching this woman flirting with Zack, touching his arm, giggling at his jokes, exposing her firm neck to his gaze. This was not a new experience for Mandy with Zack. Look, Mandy was a realist, and knew that while she was a six, and her husband was, like, a nine or a ten to most people, so this wasn't the first time Mandy had witnessed another woman flirting with Zack. For some reason, when some women saw them together, it just didn't click with them that they were a couple. But Zack was always a good, loyal boyfriend, never encouraging this behavior in the very hot women who flirted with him. And at the first opportunity, he would deftly discourage this behavior, casually mentioning his girlfriend or their impending nuptials. Most of the time, that was enough to push them away. But sometimes, that didn't stop the flirting, as was the case here as Trina flirted with Zack, despite being obviously aware of his engagement. Mandy eventually made her presence known, and despite Trina being polite to her, she spent the whole time talking with Zack, rarely directing anything at Mandy unless Mandy interjected. If this wasn't fully paid for, Mandy would have sought out another location and not have given Trina their business, but there was no time for another change in plans. But when they left Zack gave Mandy a knowing glance, letting her know that he knew what Trina was up to, and that she had nothing to be worried about. 

Mandy was well aware of the effect Zack had on women. It wasn't that he had model good looks. He wasn't pretty like some of those guys might be. He was very handsome, but in an approachable way. He was well built, fit without being cut, and he was charming enough to stir up affection in any girl he talked to. It was just... he was a man. Simple as that. He was just masculine in a way that would get any woman's juices flowing. There was just something about him, this indefinable quality in him that made him strikingly appealing to women, and Mandy felt incredibly lucky to be the one on the receiving end of his love and affection. 

And his big dick. 

Mandy's juices were stewing at the moment, sitting close to her fiancé, his presence preventing her from concentrating. She finally tossed her stupid notebook across the room and leaned back against her fiancé as he laughed in her ear at her sudden maneuver. 

"So... what's left to do?" he asked. 

"Well, I have to get a few other small things settled, but I think we're pretty good. The big thing left is getting the rehearsal all settled, but it won't be a true rehearsal because Vanessa can't make it, so there's that. She... she's not exactly making all of this easy for me. For someone who is paying for my entire wedding out of the kindness of her heart, she's being a real pain in ass," Mandy said, causing Zack to smile. It was true. Vanessa had a business commitment the day of the rehearsal, so despite her huge role in this wedding, her first appearance would be at the wedding itself, which was just peachy. But other than that, there was small, tedious stuff that Mandy wanted to just get done, but she was not in the mood to do that now. 

"Well, maybe I can talk to her... straighten her out," Zack offered. "Although, that might be tough, since I've never actually met her." 

"No offense, honey, but she would eat you alive," Mandy replied, not looking away from the TV screen. It was true that Zack had never actually met Vanessa. He had a rough sketch of her in his mind from Mandy based on her descriptions, but that was it. Until now, Mandy had never really involved her personal life into her work sphere, so there was no reason for them to ever meet. 

"I don't know... I work at a bar, and I'm pretty good at handling the people there. I'm sure I can handle the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, no sweat." Zack said with a smirk. 

"I'd like to see you try," Mandy replied knowingly. They paused for a moment, and basked in the warm silence of contentment. 

"I can't wait," Zack began, rubbing his fiancée's shoulders. "Till this is all over and we can both just relax." He kissed her cheek as the tension left her body. She pulled herself from his grip and spun around, moving to straddle Zack. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed herself against him, staring right into his eyes. 

"And I can't wait till we get married," Mandy said, moving forward to press her lips to his softly. "And you make my dreams come true." She kissed him again, as she slid her right hand towards his left hand, sliding her fingers across his. "And you have a ring on your finger..." She gave him another long, soft kiss. "And everyone will know that you belong to me," Kiss. "And I belong to you." She kissed him again, her stomach pressed against his. She could feel his sizable bulge pressing against her. He pulled back from her slightly and laughed, placing his hands on her hips. 

"What... you didn't care for Trina?" Zack asked, causing her to roll her eyes. 

"Well, I am looking forward to not seeing all those girls hitting on you anymore," Mandy said. 

"You have nothing to worry about," he reaffirmed with her again. 

"I know," she said, totally trusting in Zack as she smiled and kissed him again, this one a bit more passionate. 

Zack hadn't always the best of boyfriends. In his younger years, during high school, when he was in the midst of all those high school social politics, with girls competing over the same boy, he had been caught up in that whirlwind. He had been treated almost like property at times, property that had been taken and stolen between the members of this group of competitive young women. He was one of the main targets among the girls in high school, as each wanted to be on the receiving end of his rumored fantastic sexual prowess and huge throbbing cock. So yeah, there had been times where he had been traded off between girls, being stolen by one girl from another. Sure, it wasn't a conscious decision for the most part, as alcohol had been involved in a lot of these discretions, but he wasn't entirely blameless. At the time, he didn't feel too bad, as he didn't see any particular future with any of those girls, so he was happy to just have a good time and some utterly fantastic sex with some completely filthy young women, who were willing to do absolutely anything to land a guy. And when he was fucking them... he had never felt more alive. But looking back, he knew he had unwittingly toyed with these girls' feelings, and broken some hearts. No matter how nasty hot those girls were, it was still a cruddy thing to do. He was young and stupid, so he had written it off as some youthful indiscretions, and vowed never to act like that again. 

None of those relationships mattered to him like his relationship with Mandy did. This was the only one that really felt like something real, something on a level beyond just the physical one. This was a relationship built to last, and he knew better than to screw it up. 

As his kiss with Mandy deepened, both of them started to lose control. He was grinding his thickening cock against her, and she was pressed against him firmly. As her hand slid down to massage his protruding erection, he was forced to push her away, reluctantly. 

"Hey... we can't... we need to wait..." he replied, reminding her of the promise they had made. They had had sex plenty of times, but now that they were nearly at the wedding, they had promised each other to wait, to save up their desire so their wedding night would be a memorable one. Mandy pouted sadly but knowingly. 

"You're right," she said, kissing him on the nose, "But sometimes, I can't control myself with you," she said, before kissing him again. He laughed lovingly before pushing her away one last time, the two pulling away from each other. Both of them wanted nothing more than to hop into bed, but they knew the wait would be worth it. 

Their wedding night would be explosive. 

*************** 

Vanessa went to her favorite stylist to get primped up for the big wedding, and as she did, she realized this was the first time she could really relax and think over everything. 

Vanessa's involvement in her young assistant's impending nuptials stirred up feelings within her. Other than a few one night stands, it had been a long time since she had been in a long-standing relationship. Her reputation had driven all the good ones away. But honestly, those type of guys were dreadfully boring to her at this point. It wasn't so much that she missed companionship or anything like that. Vanessa was just fine on her own in that sense. The problem was... Vanessa needed to get laid. Badly. She needed hot sex. A black woman of her age, with her temperament, and her hot body, she deserved to be getting hot and sweaty three times a day. Minimum. But alas, she was single, and her hot black body was going woefully un-worshipped. 

Her cravings were getting very, very specific. She didn't need someone with a huge bank account, although that certainly wouldn't hurt. She didn't need a powerful businessman, or a dynamic athlete. She had run through all of the eligible, African-American bachelors in her tax bracket, and they had all ended with disappointment. She was a woman of simple tastes. Like many women her age, she wanted someone young, to keep up with her voracious needs. She wanted someone strong, fit and gorgeous enough to give her the raw, physical attention she craved. That wasn't too bad, right? Vanessa Jones, the powerful CEO, simply wanted a mate who was young, and strong... and most importantly... white. 

Vanessa had always had a raw, physical attraction to white men. In her college days, she had spent many hot and sweaty nights with getting filled with beefy white cock, making her writhe and squeal in a way she never had with her black boyfriends. In her experiences her white lovers were just so much more into her, so much more obsessed with her body, and so much more eager to give her the pleasure she craved. When white guys fucked her, when their big, strong white hands slid over her smooth, luscious, naked black skin, they pleasured her with worship in their eyes. They treated her like the queen she was. A lot of her black boyfriends ended up treating her like another notch on the bedpost. 

And it wasn't just about how eager the white men were with her. To her, the simple fact was, the sex was better. Call it a preference, a fetish, whatever you'd like. Taut, white skin against her dark, black sexy flesh was her ultimate turn-on. To put it quite bluntly, white dick did it for her more than anything. A fat white cock entering her tight black cunt made her squeal. Made her scream at the top of her lungs. Made her gush like nothing else ever had. Long, hard, tasty white dick was the ultimate in pleasure for this mature, powerful African-American woman.  

===

She tried keeping her preference for white men under wraps for a while, but she was eventually caught in action, and from that point on, she felt like her black friends were looking down at her for getting involved with white men. They looked at her as if she was betraying some unspoken vow. But deep down, Vanessa fucking knew that all her girlfriends were doing it to, but they would never admit it. So unfortunately, she had to move on from white guys or risk becoming an outcast from her black friends. She had to write it off to her friends as a passing phase and nothing more. She knew it shouldn't be that way, but that's how it was. 

It had been a long time since she had sampled some tasty white meat. Being a successful, African-American woman made her a symbol for her black sisters and she knew she would risk their support if she indulged her love of white men publically. She kept her dating life well within her own race for years, and the few times she found herself alongside one of the black women she knew from college, who knew about her past, she maintained this façade. When confronted with her history, or if they were in the presence of a piece of hot white man, Vanessa would insist that, 'she didn't do that shit no more.' 

But at this point, after four failed marriages, and going for so long without any action, thoughts of white men were filling her brain. What she wouldn't give to have a hot, young, buff, obedient white boy, willing to satisfy all of her needs. The thought sounded deliciously forbidden to the older black woman. 

So, despite knowing how risky it was, all Vanessa could hope for in preparing for her assistant's wedding was that maybe she could tempt a hunky groomsmen into doing some very dirty things. Her last fling with the doctor ended up being a total bust in the bedroom, making her all the more impatient. The sex she would no doubt be having the night of the wedding would be her reward for all this hard work. Vanessa knew better, and she knew it was a big risk, but her body was calling the shots, and it was dying for satisfaction. She had her goal, and she knew exactly what she aiming for. A hot, young, hunky, white groomsman. That was her mission. 

She didn't know it yet, but Vanessa was about to land an even bigger target. 

************* 

Mandy stood in front of the mirror at the church, all done up, ready to get married. And she was shaking like a leaf. She was terrified. Her head was full of questions. 'What if I don't look good? What if this is all too fast? What if Zack realizes I'm not that interesting after being together for a little bit?' This all seemed too good to be true. It just has to fall apart. Mandy just couldn't relax, and she was so emotional she wanted to cry, and she would if it wouldn't ruin her makeup. 

Mandy barely heard the door behind her open up behind her, and it was the smooth voice that spoke up that let her know the identity of the person behind her. 

"Oh, child, you look amazing!" Vanessa said. 

"Well, I feel like a disaster," Mandy said, steeling herself trying to present a strong image to her boss. She turned to face Vanessa. "I feel like a nervous... holy crap!" Mandy was interrupted by the sight of her boss standing in front of her. 

Vanessa was looking absolutely stunning. Simply incredible looking, a vision in gold. She was wearing a very, very thin gold dress, glimmering in the light of the room with every step. You could just tell this dress was exceedingly expensive, and you could also tell it was designed to perfectly highlight the older woman's incredibly voluptuous form. It molded to her hourglass figure, highlighting all her best curves. Even though it went down to her ankles, there was a long slit along the side, leaving nearly the entire length of her right leg exposed. On her feet, she had a matching pair of thin, expensive fashionable high heels. The dress hugged her fit, luscious body, and any one lucky enough to be behind her could study the immaculate shape of her full, round, juicy ass. It was a study of perfection. Vanessa's ass jutted from her luscious frame like a shelf, each cheek perfectly, artfully round, perky and firm, showing off the benefits of her dedicated workout routine. Her ass was big, while not being overly huge. And the thin, golden dress molded across its immaculate shape, highlighting each firm cheek, and giving a hint of the lustful crevasse in between. Following from there, the dress clung to her firm, athletic back, leading up to the two thin straps holding the dress on her, digging into her smooth shoulders. Her long, lithe arms were left bare. But most importantly, the upper half of her chest was left exposed as well, as the dress and the two thin spaghetti straps struggled to contain her enormous breasts. 

Vanessa's tits looked absolutely mammoth when exposed this way. The dress covered what it could, but a good portion of the upper halves of her boobs, as well as the canyon-like cleavage where her massive, full breasts pressed together lusciously, were completely exposed. The thin gold dress emphasized her breasts' perfect round shape, highlighting every immaculate curve. Her tits looked enormous jutting out from her voluptuous body, causing the thin straps to dig noticeably into her shoulders. 

Up top, her hair and make-up were perfect, her dark curls running stylishly down her back, and her thick, plump lips coated with a deep layer of crimson lipstick. Her lips were turned up in a smile as she glanced at the bride. 

Mandy was left speechless. She was glad to have Vanessa's presence, but her body, in that dress... there was no doubt Vanessa was going to be stealing a lot of attention. 

That was the plan for the older woman. Vanessa wasn't planning to be subtle here. Sure, she might be pushing things a bit over-the-top, but the physical need for her to get laid was preventing her from feeling any shame for showing up the young bride. The dress felt so thin on her she felt practically naked, and the sensation of her silky dress against her flesh turned her on. There was no way she could wear a bra with this dress, but honestly, she was completely happy with the idea of letting the twins free for the day, letting them bounce and jiggle for the no-doubt appreciative audience at the wedding. The only thing she had on beneath her dress was a microscopic gold thong, which covered her cunt just barely, and bisected the twin globes of her delicious ass. Vanessa was primed for a good time, and if she had her way, she would get it. 

Mandy couldn't help but notice her boss's massive black breasts bounce and jiggle around in her tight dress as she approached her. In this huge moment in young Mandy's life, bigger things should be on her mind than her boss's mammoth rack, but in the same manner they were trying to force their way out from under her thin dress, they were forcing their way to the forefront of Mandy's frazzled mind. 

"Honey, you have nothing to worry about," Vanessa said, coming to a stop in front of Mandy, her boobs bouncing as she came to a stop. Vanessa reached down and straightened up her secretary's hair. "I've taken care of everything. Most of the guests are arriving as expected. The photographer was giving me some shit, but I straightened him out. The pastor is here. I've checked with the caterers, and everything is set. The groomsmen are here, except for the best man, who is currently driving your husband here, and from what he said, they will be here soon. So, everything's running as planned. At these weddings, I run a tight ship." 

Mandy nodded appreciatively. She straightened up and asked her boss, "So... how do I look?" She smiled tentatively up at her boss, desperately in need of some sort of approval. 

"Hon... you look gorgeous," Vanessa replied, smiling at her secretary, who was forever thankful for this validation. Vanessa wasn't particularly fond of the dress Mandy had chosen for herself. She found it cheap looking, unflattering, and lacking the sophistication and elegance of the type of dress Vanessa preferred. Mandy's was a dress you go downtown to buy, while Vanessa preferred the type you have to go to a specialty boutique in Paris to have personally made for you. The dress had already been purchased by the time Vanessa had gotten involved in the wedding, and it would just crush the poor girl if she gave the smallest bit of criticism, so she let it slide. 

"Do you think... do you think he'll be happy with me? Will Zack be happy spending the rest of his life with me?" Mandy asked. Vanessa grabbed a small handkerchief and cleaned up some of the make-up that had gotten a little smudged. 

"I'm sure you two will be incredibly happy together. Young love is a wonderful thing. Cherish it. The worst thing that can happen between people in love is for there to be doubt between them," Vanessa said softly, in close as she cleaned up the young woman's face. As she said this, Mandy's eyes fell to the older woman's valley of exposed cleavage. "Doubt... insecurity... that's how love ends. That's how marriages die. Trust. Confidence. That's what you need to keep a marriage strong. Can you do that, honey?" 

"I think so," Mandy replied softly. 

"There's a fire in you, child," Vanessa said, stepping back slightly. "I've always told you that, and it's true. Keep that fire burning, and you and your husband will be happy as can be," she affirmed with confidence. Mandy smiled and nodded. 

"Thanks, Vanessa," Mandy replied. "For everything. I really, truly appreciate it." 

Vanessa looked down and smiled at her young protégé. She opened her arms and let the young woman step forward, giving her an appreciative hug. Mandy could feel her boss's massive breasts pressed firmly against her during the hug, and honestly, they had never felt bigger, exerting soft pressure on Mandy's chest. Mandy's inferior A-cups couldn't compete with the massive black jugs pressed against her. Mandy pulled back from her boss and smiled, putting a brave face on after that slightly uncomfortable moment. 

"Now... go get married, honey!" Vanessa warmly told Mandy. 

*************** 

As Zack got ready the morning of the wedding, he wasn't nervous at all. He wasn't nervous about getting married. He wasn't nervous about leaving the single life behind. Not in the least. In his mind, he had experienced single life to its fullest, and now, he was ready to settle down with the girl he loved. 

The only tension he felt was in his crotch. 

Zack totally supported Mandy's suggestion to hold off on sex for the home stretch before the wedding. It sounded good, and a great way to make their wedding night extra special. That being said, he was feeling the pressure. It seemed like in the last few days, every little thing was driving him wild, even stuff that wouldn't register normally. Attractive women in TV commercials or in magazine ads. It seemed like everything was turning him on. It felt like he was constantly hard. He showed great discipline in holding off from relieving the pressure himself, but that being said, he was REALLY looking forward to his wedding night. 

Luckily, his brain was too distracted on the morning of his wedding to really pay too much mind on the pressure building in his sizable nuts. So as he got ready the morning of, he was relieved that the tension he was feeling wasn't too evident and obvious to any lecherous onlooker. 

Opting to get ready at home and then head out to the church, Zack got cleaned up and dressed. He had splurged a bit to purchase his tux and it looked damn good on him, perfectly tailored to his fit frame. He was straightening his tie when his best man, Jonah, showed up ready to take him to the church. Jonah made sure Zack was ready, checking his best friend's outfit, making sure his tie was tied correctly and everything was in place. Checking to see if Zack was ready to go, Zack gave him the affirmative. Zack was ready. Nothing was gonna get in his way to marry the love of his life. 

Except traffic. 

The normally cool-headed Zack was getting impatient as the highway was a parking lot. A car accident had upset their carefully laid plans, and part of Zack was tempted to just get out and walk, thinking it would be faster. It wasn't even like the church was in the main midst of the city, it was on the outer edges, so traffic was rarely a major issue this time of day, but of course, on the one day that was most vital, it was now an issue. Jonah apologized profusely, and called the church to let them know about the delay. 

"That boy is gonna ruin this for me," Vanessa said, angrily stuffing her phone into her purse. She didn't convey to Mandy how late her husband was running. Vanessa had this whole thing running like clockwork, and that dumb fucker was gonna screw the whole thing up. How could Mandy marry someone this idiotic? That boy should have been here hours ago. 

"I want you to call your buddy," Vanessa spat out at one of the groomsmen, referring to Zack. "Call him and tell him to get his fucking ass here or I will personally walk down that fucking road, and drag him here by the ear!" The fierce side of her, normally reserved for the boardroom, was now in full bloom, and the young groomsman was backing up, terrified of the dominant black woman. 

Part of her anger was due to the fact that all the men at the wedding were total duds. The groomsmen were all schlubs, and on top of that, there wasn't a single guest at this wedding who stuck her fancy. Vanessa was right on the fucking edge. She needed to get some white dick immediately, and there was not one suitor worth a damn in this whole church. All she needed was one damn white guy with a good body, a huge dick, and who was raring to hop into bed with a dominant older black woman. It shouldn't be this difficult! Her anger was palpable as she worked the room, making sure everyone was in their right place. Even though Vanessa was footing the bill, she was starting to get on people's last nerve with her demanding attitude. 

By the time she returned to the groomsmen, about half an hour later, there was a sense of relief on their faces, and one more had joined their midst. This must be the best man, Jonah. Vanessa's anger boiled over just looking at him. He was easily forty pounds overweight, wearing stupid glasses, an unflattering suit, and a receding hairline. He would not be getting the honor to be Vanessa's mate this evening. Not in a million years. Knowing her last hope for sex was a dud, she was ready to spit fire as she approached him. 

"I thought you were the best man!" Vanessa said confrontationally, stopping in front of him, putting her hand on her hip, looking down at the shorter man. "If you were, you would have gotten him here two DAMN hours ago, and not half a fucking hour late! What were you thinking?" 

"I... I... uh... I..." Jonah stammered, looking up at the imposing black woman who he would be accompanying down the aisle. 

"You know what, where's the damn groom? I want to give him a piece of my mind!" Vanessa asked, interrupting the stammering fool. 

"Uh, back there. Back there." Jonah said, sweat on his brow as he pointed back at a closed door behind him, eager to escape from this older woman's fierce presence. Vanessa pushed past him, not having any apprehension at stepping in on the groom. What kind of damn fool runs late to his own wedding anyway? A guy like that forfeits his rights to privacy! The groomsmen scattered as she moved between them, forcing open the door, leaning into the room, finally getting a good look at the man at the center of the party she had put together. 

"You'd better have a damn good explanation for..." Vanessa began before stopping in her tracks, still in the doorway, her hand still resting on the knob, her body slightly obscured by the thick, wooden shelving next to the door. On the other side of the room was a man, standing with his back to her, adjusting his pocket square, trying to get it just right. Very rarely had Vanessa Jones been stunned into silence like this, but as her eyes took in the sight of the groom-to-be for the first time, any anger and annoyance she felt towards him evaporated. 

He was the one. The one she was waiting for. 

Some say that when someone experiences love at first sight, one's body gets warm, their heart swells, and beautiful music rings in your ears. But Vanessa wasn't feeling love. A shiver ran down her spine. Her pussy moistened. Her nipples tightened. Vanessa was experiencing something else entirely. 

Hot, filthy, nasty lust. 

No. No... this couldn't be the groom... could it? It couldn't possibly be... this wasn't what she expected. Not at all. She expected some skinny, meek, dorky little boy. Not this. No, the person standing in this room, the supposed groom, was a man. A real fucking man. A real fucking WHITE man, most importantly. 

Yes, this was EXACTLY the type of man she was looking for. 

While his bride-to-be looked like a department store bride, he looked like a million bucks. Vanessa knew that neither Mandy nor her fiancé were especially wealthy, and while his suit didn't appear to be excessively expensive, he spent his money well. His suit looked fantastic, perfectly tailored to his fit manly frame. He was tall. He appeared to be quite fit and strong. He was the type of guy that couldn't be pushed aside easily. He was a brick wall. He would stand up to you. He would push back. It would take a lot of work to make him submit, and the effort in doing so would be utterly divine. 

Vanessa admired the younger white man before he took notice of her. He was tall, and fit, as stated before, and his body didn't quit. He appeared to have nice, strong, manly arms, and a great butt. He was in shape, without overdoing it. It was clear this man was not a brainless meathead. 

She could see his reflection in the mirror, so she could see a front view of him as well. He had short, dirty blonde hair, and a very, very attractive face. His eyes were crystal blue. He had nice kissable lips, and he had a lightly tanned complexion. He had a closely shorn beard, which really complemented his face. As he stuffed a small handkerchief into his breast pocket, the older black woman noticed his big, masculine hands. This caused her eyes to drift south towards his crotch, and her trained eyes found what she was looking for. A nice, full, sizable bulge. This white boy was packing some serious heat, as expected. 

It was rare for Vanessa to be this lust-struck. She was normally so forceful and dominant, but she was stunned into silence. It felt too coincidental to be ignored. This was divinity. Here she is, craving some hard, white sex, and this prime-cut white man just falls into her lap. Within seconds, her body was overflowing with heat and lust for the man in front of her. Vanessa wanted to get hot and filthy with this fine-ass white boy, no question. He pushed all her buttons, and she immediately wanted him bad. But the significance of who he was and what he was about to do wasn't lost on her. He was getting married to her secretary. This was his wedding day, and all Vanessa could think about was seducing and fucking his brains out till he swore his undying devotion to pleasuring her hot black body. She wanted to rip off her dress, force the groom to his knees, and smother his gorgeous face with her massive black breasts. 

But she couldn't do that... right? She wasn't that big of a slut, was she? Sure, she had had sex with plenty of married men. That wasn't the problem. Her hot body made her a very juicy target for men eager to step out on their wives, and even when those men weren't so ready to cheat, Vanessa's hot black body always got the job done. But she couldn't possibly seduce and steal a man from his bride on his wedding day, especially when she the bride was her own secretary, could she? It was so wrong. So nasty. So filthy. So HOT! As positively delicious as the idea sounded to the luscious, hot-bodied older black woman, her better instincts were winning out.  

===

For now. 

Zack had heard someone enter the room, but he was so absorbed in his own thoughts that he didn't notice the intruder at first. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he noticed some movement reflected in the mirror, causing him to look up, laying eyes on the older woman standing behind him. 

While Zack had never met or even seen his wife's boss before, he knew enough to know that the woman standing in the doorway was Vanessa Jones. She hadn't noticed that he had seen her, as she seemed lost in her thoughts. Most of her body was hidden behind a shelf, so he could only see her face. Zack's first take on the older woman was a bit of a surprise. To be honest, he didn't expect her to be so attractive. He knew she was in her forties, but she looked younger, with only a stray line here and there indicating her true age. Maybe it was due to him being 25, but in his head, he thought of women her age almost as old ladies, so this was an unexpected revelation. She was probably around the same age as his mother, but this woman couldn't be any more different. Her striking features perfectly formed, indicating her past in modeling. She had high cheekbones, and her almond shaped eyes were sharp and striking. Her lips were plump and full, and her black hair was long, lush, and full. Combining all of this with her dark smooth complexion, it was safe to say that Vanessa was a stunner. 

Shaking away these thoughts, and knowing that this woman was not only his wife's boss but the woman who had paid for this entire wedding, Zack knew he had to put his best foot forward. 

"Hi..." he called out as he turned to face her, causing her eyes to jump up, meeting his. Unknown to him, she had been gawking at his butt, but he didn't need to know that. She was silent for a second as she looked at him, her expression unreadable. Fearing she might be angry, especially after hearing through the grapevine about how mad she was about his lateness, he felt the need to speak up. "You're Vanessa, right? I'm Zack, the, uh, groom. Sorry about being late. We hit the craziest traffic. I mean, I've never seen that road backed up like that." She was silent for a few moments after he spoke, before her tone softened and a smile crossed her thick lips. 

"Oh... no problem, honey," Vanessa replied, her anger immediately cooling off when confronted by this white stud. He looked so cute as he sought her forgiveness, she noted to herself. He was desperate for her approval, she thought. He so wanted to make her happy. A shiver of attraction ran through her upon these thoughts. Without moving, she shut the door behind her. He ran his hand across his head, fearing he had screwed up this whole thing. 

"I hope I didn't mess things up too much," Zack wondered. "Is Mandy freaking out?" 

"No, babe, don't worry. She's fine," Vanessa replied, her smooth, confident voice calming his nerves. 

"Uh... that's good, I was freaking out there for a minute," he said with a small laugh, glancing to the side for a second before looking back at her, just as she stepped out from behind the shelf. "I know we haven't had the chance to really meet yet, but I wanted to say..." but before he could finish, the words caught in his throat as she emerged, her body no longer obscured. His eyes widened as he took in the full expanse of her luscious frame for the first time. 

Vanessa knew exactly what she was doing as she approached the groom-to-be, a smirk crossing her lips as the words died on his, and the polite eye contact he had maintained before came to a stop as his eyes drifted downwards, taking in her juicy body with rapt attention. 

Zack couldn't hide his stare, but considering the vision he was being presented with, absolutely no one would blame him. Her shiny gold dress looked painted on, clinging to her hourglass frame, showing off the goods. His eyes traversed up from her high-heel-clad feet, up her long, bare, firm leg, the smooth black skin exposed as one leg emerged from the slit in her dress. The way the dress hugged her hips gave good promise that it was struggling to contain an amazing ass, large and firm and smooth, standing out from her fit frame, each round cheek perfectly shaped. But despite every inch of her body seeming like perfection, Zack's eyes firmly planted themselves in one specific area. Her two biggest, roundest features. 

They were absolutely enormous. Zack had seen many pairs of large breasts in his days, but nothing like this. Not even close. All those other women's racks seemed meagre and undersized in comparison. Zack couldn't take his eyes off of them. They had to be FF cups, at the very least. They were just so big! And perfectly shaped, too. They were round and full, and shockingly firm, considering the size of her mammoth rack. These were porno tits, but here in the real world. The slinky dress hugged every curve of her voluminous chest, highlighting their round, full shape and massive size. They jutted out from her chest severely, and the dress was low-cut enough to show off the tops of her enormous tits, and the deep, dark, succulent valley in between, where the mammoth jugs pressed together perfectly. They were just so big, but almost as important, they were just so black! 

Her black udders were just massive! As she strutted towards the husband-to-be, it was obvious to him that she wasn't wearing a bra. Her mammoth jugs were bouncing indecently underneath her slinky dress, almost out of control as they jiggled with every step. Her hard nipples were dancing underneath her dress with every confident step she took. The tops of her bouncing black breasts were a near hypnotic sight to the young white stud as the older black woman approached him. His eyes fell deep into the crevasse between those huge black tits and couldn't look away. 

They were simply perfect. He had laid eyes upon many pairs of breasts in his time, but none compared to these. They all seemed so much smaller than these, and most noticeably, they just seemed so pale in comparison. Vanessa's massive tits just seemed so much more massive and smooth and luscious than any of the white girls he had been with. Something about Vanessa's huge black breasts just seemed so much more lust-inducing than all those other girls, as if her dark, black skin made her breasts hotter and sexier than any of those white girls' less impressive pairs. Plus, they bounced and jiggled in a mouth-watering manner, sending a jolt through his already swollen cock. 

Zack had thought he had pretty much seen and done it all in his time on the market, but he was being confronted with one very noticeable gap on his sexual resume. To put it simply, Zack had never gone black. It wasn't that he avoided black girls, it was just that his hometown was lilywhite, so there was never really any opportunity to go that way even if he wanted. So, he had no idea the types of delights a pair of huge black tits could offer, but he was learning that now. He was seeing what he was missing out on. 

The poor boy didn't even know what to do with himself when confronted with a mammoth black rack. Vanessa could easily tell he had never gone black, simply due to the fact that he was marrying a white girl. If a guy like Zack had ever gone black, he would not be marrying a white girl. Vanessa knew that for sure. Zack was built to fuck black girls, no doubt. If he had gone black, and had felt some naked black skin against his sexy white flesh, and had gone balls deep inside a tight, wet, superior black cunt, any black girl worth her salt would lock that shit down, wrapping her legs around him and never letting go. 

That very image was running through Vanessa's mind at the moment. 

As she came to a stop, the young white stud couldn't pull his eyes away from her jutting chest, the mammoth jugs taking a few extra seconds to stop jiggling. Vanessa knew he had never seen a pair quite like these, so he couldn't be blamed for gawking. His eyes were lost in her luscious cleavage, and the older black woman knew if she didn't act, he wouldn't be able to pull himself away. 

"You were saying?" Vanessa asked, causing his eyes to jump to hers. She looked at him with a near gloating expression, smiling knowingly. Knowing he had been caught, his cheeks flushed. 

"Wh... what?" he stammered. 

"You were saying you wanted to thank me for something?" Vanessa supplied, jutting out her chest, daring him to look again, daring him to thank her for bringing her massive knockers to his wedding. Her nipples were throbbing at seeing the white stud struggle not to gawk at her massive, perfect black breasts. 

"Oh, uh, yeah..." he stammered again, total discombobulated, his cheeks still red as he rubbed his forehead, trying to regain his composure. There were a few times where he almost looked at Vanessa's breasts again, but he caught himself each time. He wanted to look, he SO wanted to. They were just so big! And lusciously smooth and black. No... NO! He couldn't. "I, uh... I just wanted to thank you for... everything. The wedding, the reception, all of it. I truly appreciate it, and Mandy does too," he stated, meeting her gaze, finally finding his words long enough to compose a complete sentence. "I don't know what we could ever do to repay you." 

Vanessa had a few good ideas, but she bit her tongue. 

"Don't worry about it," she replied. "I have my moments of generosity," she added, before letting the silence between them hang. She simply smirked at the young man as he stood nervously in front of him, her piercing gaze pointed right at him, daring him to look away. To Zack, it felt like she was truly staring into his soul, reading his thoughts, knowing how much of a struggle it was for him not to stare right at her imposing, impressive chest. 

"You can look if you want to, baby," she said with a bright, teasing smile, breaking the tension. 

"I'm sorry," he replied, stammering again, turning away from her, not wanting to put himself in the position to be tempted, especially on his wedding day. What was he doing? He had never been fazed like this before, but now, in Vanessa's presence, he was reacting like a horny teenager. 

"Trust me, I'm used to it," she replied, glancing down at her own breasts while bringing her hands up to them, cupping them in her palms and bouncing them lightly. He couldn't help but let his eyes follow, getting glued to her huge tits once more. "When you're sporting a pair this big, you get used to people staring," she paused and noticed his rapt gaze at her breasts. "I bet you've never seen a pair this big, have you?" she asked. Zack caught himself staring and looked away, taking a step towards the windows. 

"I'm... I'm so sorry!" he apologized, shocked at his own behavior, unable to look back at her. 

"Don't worry about it," she replied coolly. She smirked and pulled her hands from her breasts and looked up at the tensed groom-to-be. She stepped towards him, putting a hand on his shoulder, causing him to jump. 

"Hon, you're a bit tense," Vanessa told him with a laugh. "Like I said, don't worry about it. I've been there. As someone who's been married four times, believe me when I say there is no use tying yourself in knots before the ceremony. You just need to relax. Here," she began, rubbing his shoulder lightly. Reluctantly, he let her turn him so he was facing her again. "C'mon, let me get a good look at ya," she said from in close to him. 

She checked his outfit, straightening out his tie, and checking his tux for wrinkles, but she was honestly using this as an excuse to feel him up. She ran her hands down his arms, feeling his firm, hard muscles through his clothes. 'God, he's perfect,' Vanessa thought to herself. She couldn't help but imagine him naked, running her hands across his taught, bare, white skin. He even smelled good, Vanessa noticed as she leaned in close, his natural masculine scent, combined with his subtle cologne, sent another surge of raw lust through her. 

"Mmm... damn. I tell you, Mandy is one lucky girl," she whispered to him, her silky voice making him shiver. 

Zack was frozen in place, not knowing what to do, not knowing why he was reacting like this. Maybe it was the newness of being presented with this epitome of black female sexuality. Maybe it was the fact this bombshell was an older woman. Sure, working in a bar, he had been shamelessly hit on by many horny old housewives, but none possessed the raw sexuality and obvious, lust- inducing appeal that Vanessa did. Her older age, with her luscious black skin and lust inducing body, combined to create a beacon of sex that the soon-to-be groom could barely handle, especially in his current state. 

There was animal heat between them. The tension was thick between them immediately, even if Zack didn't want to admit it to himself. Between the silences and long pauses, their bodies were communicating. Her nipples were as hard as diamonds, evident through the thin dress. His lengthy cock was throbbing, his bulge clear in his pants. Her pussy was dripping her delightful sex juices as pre-cum leaked from the tip of his dick. Her breathing got deeper, as did his. A shiver went up her spine, matching the one that went down his. Their bodies were already preparing for hot interracial sex, because for these two, no other outcome seemed possible. A gorgeous, horny older black woman with enormous breasts, confronted with a young, fuckable piece of prime white meat... hot sex seemed like it should be inevitable. Their bodies were ready. Their bodies were prepared to get hot and sweaty. Their limbs were ready to get tangled between the sheets. Her pussy was readying itself to lovingly and eagerly swallow his massive white shaft up to the balls. His cock was readying itself for that very same journey inside her, plus a few other filthier ones. His nuts were working overtime, readying themselves for some heated and aggressive sexual action, filling up to the brim with hot, thick cum, knowing that excessive amounts of semen would be needed to please the hot black woman standing in front of him. 

But despite this raw, sexual attraction, Zack knew better, as did Vanessa. As hot as the sex would be between them, and it would be very hot, both understood the repercussions. Vanessa was, for now, still being held back by those nagging morals inside her head. And obviously, Zack was about to get married, and as hot and sexy as his wife's boss was, nothing could or would happen. He had made his choice, and he was happy with it. He was about to get married, and as tempting of a body as Vanessa had, Zack had to push back against these thoughts. He thought he had evolved beyond this type of thinking, but he now realized he had to stifle it out once and for all. He had to stop thinking this way. Once he and Mandy were married, he wouldn't let himself think this way again. He had one last moment of weakness before the wedding where he checked out a sexy as hell creature. It was one last mistake. Now, he knew better and he should be all good. 

Vanessa stepped back and gave him the once-over and looked up at him and gave him an approving nod. But as much as she approved of this alone time with this hot white man, her inner control freak was winning out, and the knowledge that her well laid plans for the wedding were getting thrown off was enough to drive her into action. And plus, she didn't know if she could fight off this visual temptation much longer. 

"Well, we could stay in here all day, but you're leaving your soon-to-be-wife waiting," Vanessa said, putting her hands on her hips. "You ready to get married?" 

Zack nodded, stood up straight, and steeled himself. 

"Yes," he replied, a little shakier than he intended. "Yes I am." 

***************** 

The ceremony was actually the least exciting part of the wedding. The large fancy church was filled to the brim, a far cry from the small, intimate wedding Mandy originally had planned. The rows were packed were guests, but only a small percentage of these guests were actually acquaintances of the bride and groom, as Vanessa had filled up the guest list with her friends and acquaintances. 

But it was all a blur to Mandy as she walked down the aisle. Despite her humble plans, she had to admit that this was the type of wedding most women dreamed of. The church looked beautiful, with beams of sunlight shining through the fancy windows. The guests were all well dressed, happy and smiling. This is what you imagine your wedding day being like. 

All these thoughts faded when Mandy stood up at the front of the church next to Zack. When she looked up at him, and he looked back at her, the excitement and happiness on his face matching her own, all the other distractions faded away. Her entire world was just him and her. And when they said 'I Do', and their lips met, she felt a pure joy and happiness that she had never experienced in her young life. 

It was the greatest moment in Mandy's life. 

This joy carried over through the beginning of the reception. After the ceremony, and after the happy couple and the entire wedding party took pictures in some scenic settings near the church, everyone made their way into the heart of the city for the reception. While most of the guests transported themselves, the wedding party were taken in fancy limos. Experiencing this type of high- life was a cool experience for this humble, Midwestern couple. 

When they entered the reception hall and were greeted with a warm voluminous response, Mandy was incredibly happy. As the couple got settled, they had the opportunity to look around for the first time and really take in some of the people that were attending. 

There were some recognizable faces that either one or both of them recognized. There were some well known actors and actresses that they recognized. There were some famous athletes that Zack knew of, basketball and football players. There were some faces from the business world that Mandy knew, some pretty rich and powerful people who had passed through the office. Vanessa had made good with a lot of very powerful women, both in the business world, and outside it, and a lot of them were in attendance. There was a very well known and notorious fashion icon, the editor-in-chief of 'Style' Magazine, Nina Baxter, with her much younger husband by her side. But most shockingly, somehow, someway, Vanessa pulled off a major coup and landed a legit, major, A-list celebrity. 

Naomi was in attendance. 

Yes, that Naomi. The billionaire TV host and entrepreneur, and probably one of the few black women in America who was more rich and powerful than Vanessa. Her TV show had led her to become one of the most powerful and revered women in the country. Major celebrities went on her show to make deep confessions under her stern, firm gaze, things they wouldn't say to anyone else. People that never did TV interviews would talk to her on her show. She was a huge deal. Mandy had heard rumors that they were friends, but she didn't really believe it until now. 

Vanessa had clearly gone all out with the guest list, and while it made Mandy and Zack feel like big deals, this is where the discomfort started to set in for Mandy. While she was truly appreciative of Vanessa's help, part of Mandy wished for the small, humble wedding she had been planning. She wished she could look out at the crowd and see people she actually recognized. The crowd was very rich, and a majority of them were black, which was fine, but it felt less like her wedding and more like a party where she was an outsider. 

This feeling would only get stronger as the reception went on. 

Her discomfort was starting to match that which her new husband was feeling. His discomfort wasn't due to the sensation of being an outsider at his own wedding. No, it was due to the fact that he couldn't get Vanessa out of his head. 

Even during the ceremony, Zack found himself struggling to look away from his wife's hot black boss. When she walked down the aisle with his best man, Zack found himself staring hungrily at the older black maid of honor. His eyes fell to her magnificently large breasts, jiggling hypnotically as she sauntered down the aisle. He would catch himself after a few moments, pulling his eyes from her clearly throbbing nipples, but despite the fact that he could have friends and family catch him in the act, his eyes kept falling to her bulbous chest throughout the ceremony. What was he doing? This was his wedding? What the fuck is wrong with him? He's better than this. He should know better than to be checking out another woman on his wedding day, but this luscious creature was something he had never come across before. So hot. So sexy. So black...  

===

The worst part was, every time he would glance over at Vanessa, stolen glances in moments where he would be looking away from his wife-to-be, Vanessa would be looking right back at him. Either looking him in the eyes, matching his gaze, or checking him out in the same way he had been doing to her. It was clear to him, if it wasn't before, that this tension between them went both ways. And even when he wasn't looking at her, he could feel her eyes on him, and that sensation made him shiver with discomfort. 

This was supposed to be the happiest day of his life. He WAS happy with Mandy and everything related to the wedding, but this strange tension between him and Vanessa was weighing on his brain on this important day. He should be thinking about his new wife, and the amazing life they were about to have together, not his wife's boss's huge black tits. 

This tension was weighing him down, even during the moments where he wasn't around Vanessa and her juicy, delectable body. Even during normal interactions, like when he was talking to the Mother Superior of the Church. He was genuinely interested in the conversation, as she was part of a newer sect of the church that was apparently spreading like wildfire across the nation. 

It became clear there was one topic on her mind. And, distressingly enough, it happened to be sex. Zack was shocked to hear the Mother Superior so openly and vividly describe her Church's progressive feelings about sex, about how encouraging and sex-positive they were. She told Zack how active they were in reaching out to all their parishioners to embrace the bliss that sex can bring them, explaining that they did this for a wide range of people, from bursting- with-hormones 18-year-olds all the way to people who were a lot older. She wanted her church to be full of very happy and fully satisfied parishioners, and so far, according to her, that mission had been a major success. According to her, true happiness and peace came from having amazing sex. The Mother Superior said that people had been so trained to be ashamed of sex, that they felt it was their duty to undo that damage. It was certainly a shocking message, to say the least, but while Zack wasn't exactly interested in joining up with this odd church sect, their message certainly spoke to Zack. The Mother Superior could definitely sense his surprise at how open she was about this topic, but she explained how quickly their message was spreading, and how Vanessa had become a very active member of this sect, which was, no doubt, how Vanessa was able to call in the favor to use the church for the wedding. In the state he was in, the last thing he really wanted to be talking about was sex, and hearing these words coming from a nun...it had a strange affect. 

Despite the fact that the Mother Superior was a much older woman, and, you know, a nun, the overstimulated Zack found himself watching her smooth, plump lips as she described, in great detail, some of the vivid sex acts these nuns encouraged among their parishioners. He caught himself checking out her surprisingly huge breasts in her surprisingly tight habit, and the way they would jiggle as she talked. Zack had chatted her up as a respite from the strange temptation he had been facing from Vanessa, and to distract himself from the dull ache emanating from his swollen nuts, but he just happened to chat up the one nun in the world who was shockingly attractive and loved discussing sex. Thoughts of sex were now clouding his mind more than ever! 

He had to get it together. He was literally checking out a nun! This was so wrong! Sure, she was very sexy, and she had a great body, but this was way over the line, and it was gonna get him into a lot of trouble if he didn't control himself. The coy smile she gave him when she caught him staring sent a shiver of discomfort through him. What was going on? Even nuns were flirting with him! Sure, he got flirted with a lot, but it seemed like, now that he was married, the heat had been turned up a thousand percent. It was like the world had just gone insane, and was now filled with seductive women eager to make advances on him. 

This feeling didn't change even after his arrival at the reception. It felt like all the women Vanessa enlisted to attend the wedding had to have a minimum cup size to gain entry, that size being fucking enormous, cause he'd never seen so many large-busted women in one place since that time he was dragged to Hooters with some college buddies. It was ridiculous! While Vanessa was his first real encounter with a luscious, huge-busted black woman, the reception was full of them. Some older than Vanessa, some younger, all sexy, all luscious, although none of them matched up to Vanessa, at least in his mind. Vanessa was the hottest and sexiest of them all, in his opinion. And while the majority of the invitees were black, the white women invited were stacked as well. There was lots of bare skin being shown off blatantly, each woman trying to be the star of the reception. There were tits and cleavage all over the place. Everywhere you looked, you would see a large crevasse of white cleavage, or absolutely massive canyons of black cleavage. 

No married man should have to face this level of visual temptation on his wedding day. 

Vanessa had initially been able to let her better side win out and ignore the obvious sexual tension between herself and Zack, willingly ceding him to her young assistant. But as the day went on, and Vanessa thought about Zack more and more, she found herself getting more and more upset. What did Mandy accomplish in life to deserve the privilege of getting deep-dicked by that fine-ass white boy for the rest of her life? Vanessa was a CEO of a fortune 500 company, and that little young girl was nothing! She couldn't get anywhere without Vanessa's help, and now, she had landed that fucking stud, who is clearly a perfect match for Vanessa, by the way. And Vanessa had to stand and watch as her ideal mate gets married off to that tiny, plain, young white thing... it wasn't right. Not right at all. 

It did give her solace to know that Zack wasn't sexually attracted to Mandy. Yes, that fact was clear to Vanessa upon meeting him. He might lie to himself, convince himself that he was attracted to his wife in a sexual manner, and Mandy no doubt did the same, convincing herself that he was attracted to her, but he wasn't. No, a guy like Zack didn't want a skinny little waif like Mandy. He didn't want a girl he could break. Zack wanted a woman with curves. Luscious curves that he could really grab a hold of during sex. A round, full ass. Big tits. That's what he craved, a woman who could break him. A woman with big tits. He didn't want a pale, dull young girl like Mandy. He wanted a real woman. A black woman. An older black bitch who could dominate him, who could ride his magnificent white cock like a hot, horny bitch and fuck him into absolute submission. 

It was these thoughts, this desire to make that strong, confident young white man bend the knee to her every command that drove Vanessa's behavior during the reception. This resentment over her assistant landing this perfect catch boiled over into anger, and it was driving her to lash out. 

"Get your ass moving!" she yelled, looking out of place in the kitchen clad in her expensive gold dress. "I want food on the tables in 15 minutes! These are people you don't fucking keep waiting!" she screamed out at the cooks in the kitchen, kicking their ungrateful asses into gear. She had hired one of the most well regarded chefs in the city to cater the reception, a guy who was respected and feared in his kitchens, but Vanessa was one of the few who had enough clout and hard-driving attitude to tell him what to do. 

Vanessa was in her element, bossing people around. That was one of the perks of being the boss, telling people what to do, and she loved it. She thrived in it. She was bossing around the cooking staff, the wait staff and the people who ran the reception hall, everyone. All the tension that had been worked up in her by Zack was being taken out on these innocent bystanders, and she was practically a whirlwind as she kept the whole operation running smoothly. Seeing that everything was seemingly in order, it was time for her to work the room. 

"This is pretty crazy!" Mandy said, leaning over to say this to her husband as they sat at the main table. 

"I know, right?" he replied, trying to make his voice heard over loud din of voices in the fancy reception hall. 

"What percent of people here do you think we actually know?" Mandy asked, causing Zack to smile. 

"Oh, five percent... tops," he replied, glancing over at his wife, sharing a smirk. 

"This is not exactly the event I imagined us having..." she told him. 

"Well... it's certainly memorable... something we can tell our kids," Zack replied, giving her a pointed look. She grinned warmly at him. 

"Well..." she began, "The longer we stay here, surrounded by all these people we don't know, the more I want us to get out of here, be alone with the man of my dreams... and maybe we can start working on that family tonight," she teased, kissing his cheek. 

"Wow..." he said, straightening his coat, "You're being awfully forward, Mandy. I mean, I'm a married man..." he joked, causing her to smile. She leaned forward and kissed his cheeks softly a few times before pulling back, the happy couple sharing a knowing glimpse. 

These warm feelings lasted for a few minutes as some of the food and drinks were served. As this happened, Mandy looked over the room. While they had been greeted by their friends and family, most of the people they didn't know were keeping their distance, only giving them a polite greeting when they accidently ended up nearby the happy couple. But most of these fancy, well-to-do people stuck together in small groups, talking only to each other, the only people at the wedding they actually knew. 

Some annoyance set in as Mandy took in these guests. Mandy had noticed, like her husband had earlier, the kind of women that were in attendance here. Mandy didn't really approve of the fact that so many of the women here came across as being incredibly skanky, but Vanessa had been in charge of padding out the guest list and it was clear she was good at making friends with a certain type of woman. Mandy had seen a few of them passing through the office, so she knew about their reputations. She knew what type of women they were. Like this one woman, Tori Kryzel... Krys... anyway, she went by Tori K, and she was the assistant to some big deal business guy over at some other company. But anyway, the rumor through the grapevine was that she was a complete and total slut, and she had only gotten to where she was by spreading her legs. And judging by her outfit, and the way her mammoth, bulbous tits poured over the edges of her dress, it appeared that the rumors were very true. 

But Vanessa was a big fan of her, which explained why they were talking. Next to them was one of the people from work, one of the junior sales guys, and he looked terrified standing between these two statuesque women. They talked for a good while before Vanessa gestured to the young, skinny salesman, and he pulled out a folder, which Tori signed. It was at this moment when a fact began to set in for Mandy. 

This was not about Mandy and her husband. This event was about Vanessa. 

Vanessa was using this event as an excuse to throw a get-together for herself. The wedding was merely a theme, a side-story for this party. She was using this as a way to get her friends together. She was using this as a way to finalize business deals over drinks. As kind and generous as Vanessa was being in bankrolling this entire wedding, at the end of the day, this was never about Mandy. This was Vanessa's party, and that realization saddened Mandy a bit. 

Reaching forward to pick up her drink, she downed it quickly and asked for another from a waitress passing by. 

Vanessa loved being the center of attention, and she worked over the room like a practiced party host. She had called in some favors with a lot of people, including her friends at the church, and here in this hall, and it had really paid off. This party was rocking, in more ways than one. She had already signed a multi-million dollar deal, and she was only one drink in. She greeted her friends and acquaintances, making sure they were all having a good time. Vanessa wanted to make sure people left this shindig in good spirits. Once she was satisfied that she had greeted all the people that mattered, she sauntered over to the bar. 

As she ordered her drink, she saw her old friend Naomi approach her. Perfect, Vanessa thought. 

Mandy was right that her boss had ulterior motives for this event. Vanessa, while she certainly enjoyed her job, had gotten very bored by it. In her mind, she had conquered the business world, done everything she needed to do. And quite frankly, she felt like she deserved some credit. A woman like her getting ahead in business was a god damn accomplishment, and yet, no one seemed to care. 

It always felt like, to her, that there was a stratosphere above her own. She had conquered the world of business, thinking that was what she needed to do to join the elite. And yet, somehow, it never really happened. She had a glass ceiling, so to speak, and she felt like an outsider to the world she wanted to live in. She wanted to ascend, to go from the elite to the hyper-elite. She just needed to find her in. That was why she invited who she did. To show these rich people a good time, and get her name out there with the people who really mattered. People like Naomi. 

"I think most of these people thought I was lying when I said you were coming," Vanessa explained. 

"Well, I was in town, and I had a few free hours," her slightly older friend replied. She was an icon among most successful, business-minded black women, for her business acumen, her naked ambition, and her uncommon beauty. She still looked amazing. Vanessa was sure that this billionaire had gotten a few touch- ups here and there, but despite that, she had very few wrinkles, striking good looks, and a magnificent body. Some people felt bad for ogling and sexualizing this black woman who was an icon for success, charity, and hard work. But Vanessa knew how much of a naughty bitch Naomi was, so she knew better. She had amazingly large breasts, a nice, round, juicy ass, and she knew how to get down and dirty with the best of them. 

"Well, I knew you'd show up as soon as I told you the booze was on my tab," Vanessa teased, knowing that deep down, behind her composed façade, Naomi from the street was still there. Naomi smirked lightly. As Vanessa received her drink and sipped the strong booze, both of the powerful black women turned to scan the room. Both of their eyes fell onto the married couple. Noting her gaze, Vanessa spoke up. 

"That white boy is far too much man for that little bitch," Vanessa spoke up as both eyed the hunky groom. 

"I know," Naomi replied simply, sipping her drink. 

Vanessa's resentment about her assistant's marriage was affecting the once warm feelings she had for Mandy. Vanessa had seen a fire in her young assistant, despite her shy feelings, and that, adding onto the fact that she felt a kinship with her as woman in a man's business, encouraged Vanessa to build up her young assistant from a girl into a young professional woman. But now, Vanessa was regretting that choice, as that little undeserving bitch was now the only thing in the way of the sex Vanessa should be having. If that plain little thing was out of the picture, it would be Vanessa in that rightful place, on the receiving end of that massive white dick. Vanessa's warm feelings for Mandy were almost gone, and in its place was an urge to destroy her in the way she had destroyed so many others in the battlefield of sex. 

"I'm sure you've noticed, but... white boy is huge..." Naomi said, raising her perfectly trimmed eyebrows, glancing at her slighter younger friend. 

"Oh yeah, I noticed," Vanessa replied before taking a bigger gulp of her strong drink. Naomi looked at her friend, who was looking rapt at the young white groom. She sidled up closer to her, making sure their conversation was only between them. 

"Then hon, why aren't his balls slamming against your ass already?" Naomi whispered. Vanessa looked over at her idol, slightly surprised. 

"He just got married to my secretary... she's a sweet girl," Vanessa replied, voicing her conscience. 

"So?" Naomi replied simply. "Good secretaries are a dime a dozen. There's a reason I go through, like, a dozen assistants a year. A guy like that... no secretary is worth denying yourself that fine-ass white boy." Vanessa looked at her idol, unsure. 

"A white boy like him, if word got out..." Vanessa began. Naomi laughed. 

"Hon, I don't know what black bitch got in your head and has you all hung up, but I guarantee she is currently swallowing a fat, white cock," Naomi tittered, laughing at her surprisingly naïve friend. "Nessa... we all do it. Everyone one of us. You know that young, fine-as-hell pop singer I had on my show, the one preaching abstinence and godliness to all his fans... yeah, I had him railing my hot ass for hours. I fear the poor thing's obsessed. Trust me, babe, any black woman who's been around the block long enough starts to get curious about the other side, the white side, some sooner than others. And trust me when I tell you that once you switch sides, there's NO going back. I've been fucking white men and only white men for years, as do most of my friends. And I guarantee that 95% of the black women in this room, young and old, currently have hot young white men feasting on their sexy black bodies. No one cares. No one would blame you. You're only denying yourself. So go... take that white boy. Do it before one of these other nasty bitches beats you to it. Make him yours. Push his skinny little bride to the side. A girl like that can't hold on to a fine piece like him. Women like us don't let young girls like that stand in our way. Destroy her. Ruin her. Fuck her man better than she ever could. And in that dress, I don't expect that you should have too much trouble." Naomi finished, giving her friend the once over. Vanessa got more pumped up and encouraged the more her idol spoke. By the end, she was ready. She turned to face Naomi. 

"Fuck that little bitch! I'm gonna steal her man!" Vanessa proclaimed. 

"Damn right!" Naomi said proudly, slapping her friend's ass in encouragement. "You'd better make it fast, cause you're not the only one eyeing him up." 

Vanessa drained the remainder of her drink and slammed the glass on the bar. With purpose, she sauntered back onto the floor, shaking her hot ass from side- to-side, a plan forming already. Scanning the room, greeting some guests, she finally saw her target and aggressively moved towards her. 

"Trina!" Vanessa called out, getting her attention, wrapping her hand around the young woman's arm and stopping her roughly. 

"Ahh... what?" Trina called out, annoyed at this rough treatment. Balancing the empty tray of drinks on her palm, she went along with Vanessa towards the side of the room. Vanessa looked down at the young woman who was one of the people who ran this reception hall. She and Vanessa had been acquaintances for a while, and while they were not particularly close friends, both saw each other for what they really were, namely, shrewd, seductive bitches, and that garnered a certain level of professional respect between the two. 

"You see that bitch over there?" Vanessa said, pointing right at Mandy. 

"What... the bride?" Trina responded with a snotty, impatient tone. 

"I want that little bitch loaded. I want you to keep feeding her drinks till she can't see straight." Vanessa affirmed firmly, affixing a tone that would make most people squirm. But not Trina. She turned to look at the happy couple for a few moments before deducing Vanessa's true goal.  

===

"You're making your play for the groom?" Trina asked, and the older woman's narrowed eyes were all the confirmation she needed. "I should warn you... he's a tough nut to crack. I made a move on him, and he didn't bite." 

"Well, I have gifts you don't..." Vanessa replied firmly, causing Trina to roll her eyes. "So, are you getting that plain little thing drunk out of her mind, or will I have to find someone else?" 

"What's in it for me?" Trina replied, not backing down. Vanessa contemplated the young Asian woman in front of her. She was a tough one, no doubt, and she wasn't gonna let this go easily. 

"I'll let you have a roll in the hay with him," Vanessa answered, affixing the same tone she would employ when making a deal in the boardroom. "And if things go to plan, there might be a full-time job in it for you," Vanessa added, seeing some value in the ambitious little slut in front of her. Trina paused for a moment, thinking before replying. 

"Deal." Trina said, shaking the older black woman's hand. 

Neither of them knew that Mandy was well on her way to getting the job done herself. She had already had a few as she got more and more uncomfortable, prompting a surprised question of concern from Zack. 

"Are you okay?" he asked. 

"I'm fine," Mandy replied, forcing a smile as she felt more and more alone surrounded by all these people. Sensing her discomfort, the husband moved to act. He stood up and held his hand out. 

"C'mon, Mandy..." he said, looking so much like the dashing prince of her dreams. "Can I have this dance?" 

Looking up at Zack, seeing his handsome face and warm, loving smile, any discomfort she was feeling seemed meaningless. It didn't matter that this wasn't the wedding she had planned. It didn't matter that she didn't really know anyone here. What mattered was her husband, and the bright future they had. There was no use wallowing in annoyance. That's no way to start off a new life together. Daintily, she reached up and placed her hand in his, smiling up at him. 

"You may," she replied, like a fancy lady, full of affection for her husband. 

As he led her to the center of the dance floor, they weren't the only people dancing. Some people took notice of the new couple on the dance floor and made space for them, but others were too distracted and absorbed with their own business to notice or care. As they began to move together, for the first time, she felt like a princess, held in the arms of her prince charming. The fancy setting, the crowd of the rich and the elite... she truly felt like the belle of the ball. They danced for a while, to some up tempo music and some slow music and as she rested her ear against Zack's chest, feeling his steady heartbeat, she knew she was with the man of her dreams, and that they would be together forever. 

"Alright, alright, time to spread the wealth around," came a voice from beside them. Next to them stood Vanessa, sipping a drink, waiting expectantly, with a hand on her pointed hip. 

"Oh, uh, what?" Mandy asked, jolted out of the warm moment. 

"Well, I know you two lovebirds could stay out here together all day, but it's time to spread the love a bit," Vanessa said, resisting the urge to grin at the thought of the groom spraying his thick, creamy 'love' across her huge, black tits. "C'mon, let me butt in," she said, stepping forward. "You know how this works. The maid of honor gets her turn with the groom." 

"Oh... okay." Mandy said, backing down as her boss stepped between her and her husband. As the older black woman turned to face Zack, she realized she still had a drink in her hand. 

"Hold this for me, hon," Vanessa said, forcing her drink into her young assistant's hand. "And go... go dance with best man. Go dance with, uh... Jonah," she told Mandy dismissively, speaking Jonah's name with disgust, as if knowing that dancing with him was far less preferable than dancing with the handsome, well-built groom. As soon as she dismissed her secretary, Vanessa turned her focus solely towards Zack, no longer concerned with Mandy. 

"Hi, baby," Vanessa said, flashing her brilliant white teeth at Zack as she stepped forward, putting her arms around Zack's neck. Zack, after his last experience with the mature, luscious black woman, wasn't exactly thrilled to be in such close proximity to her again. So, like a nervous teenager dancing with a girl for the first time, he left a lot of space between their bodies as he put his hands lightly on her hips. Leaving room for the holy spirit, his religious parents would say. But nothing holy would go down here, if it were up to Vanessa. 

"Uh, uh... you gotta get all up in me, babe," Vanessa said firmly, closing the gap between them, pressing her front into his as she pulled herself against him. He let out an audible grunt as felt his front collide with her voluptuous body. He had gone from being nervous in her presence, to pressing snugly up against her. He felt her massive jugs pressing into her chest and he could feel the way they were billowing outward over the edges of her sexy dress, the soft flesh forced outward as her breasts pressed against his chest. As he noticed this, he realized their close proximity might prove to be an issue. 

As Mandy stood back, and looked at the way her boss pressed herself into her new husband, she was truly shaken out of her romantic reverie. Her romantic moment was intruded upon by her forceful boss, and like so much in this wedding, things weren't going like they were supposed to. This was supposed to be her party, but it was clear that Vanessa was running the show. 

Noting the drink in her hand and not really appreciative of the fact that her boss had treated her like a glorified waitress in front of her new husband, Mandy felt no shame in downing the remainder of the glass. Finding the drink stronger than expected, she winced in response as she slammed the glass on a nearby table. Noting the best man Jonah standing nearby, she moved towards him, knowing that she had to give him a perfunctory dance. 

Vanessa was now in the prime position of the reception, dancing with the handsome groom. All the other bitches here were eyeing her with jealousy, mostly the older black women, who had already had sized up the white hunk. But Vanessa was already staking her claim to the white man's hot body, letting them all know that it would be her black ass that would soon be getting deep-dicked by this handsome white stud. She dug her fingers into the firm muscles near his shoulders possessively. 

She had a goal for this dance. Namely, she wanted to feel the full, throbbing length of his oversized white meat pressing into her belly. At the moment, due to its natural heft, she could feel a hint of his delectable, sizable cock, but he wasn't hard yet. She wanted to make him throb. She was working towards that goal in subtle ways, shaking her perfect tits against him, scrubbing her huge black boobs across his chest. She would move her hips suddenly, hoping to make his hands, which were planted firmly against her hips, slide accidently across her round, juicy ass. The ultimate goal, obviously, would be for him to furiously grope her hot black body as they furiously made out in front of his new bride before progressing to full-on rough and nasty sex in the middle of the banquet hall, but that might be too much to ask for at this point of the night. Vanessa also briefly fantasized about her hot body being enough to make the younger white man cum in his pants, but she had higher expectations of him than that. This wasn't the type of guy to lose control due to a light breeze. This white boy needed a nice, tight fuck-hole to really cum hard. And the older black woman had devious designs on making this younger white man cum hard into a nice, tight, mature fuck-hole by the end of this very night. 

Zack was a little overwhelmed. Through his periphery, he could see all the luscious black skin she was exposing, but he was controlling himself enough not to look. Feeling her hot body, specifically her massive breasts, pressed against him was driving his body wild, and no amount of thinking non-sexy thoughts was gonna be enough for him not to react. Combining that with her sexy, feminine scent right in his proximity, and it was enough to send his body into overdrive. He could feel his cock begin to stiffen despite himself. 

"You're wife's a lucky girl..." Vanessa purred, rubbing his shoulders lightly. 

"And I'm a lucky man," Zack replied, trying to deflect her flirtatious tone. 

"Indeed you are," she replied, smoothly moving her hips, her movements far more graceful and natural than Mandy's. "She's lucky she snapped you up when she did. There are a lot of sharks out in those waters who would have been happy to chew you up and spit you out. Bad women who would use you for the wrong reasons. Believe me, I know," she warned. 

"Well, uh, I had my fill of those girls in my younger days. I wanted a girl with more substance," Zack affirmed. 

"That's nice to hear," Vanessa replied, leading them in dancing. "It's refreshing to hear someone your age talk like that. But, the thing is, I'm not talking about girls... I'm talking about women. Girls are good for a good tumble now and then, but women... real women... they lock you up tight and never let you go. Women make you forget about those... pretty little young things. Women know exactly what they are doing, what they want, and how to take it. Those are the ones you have to watch out for." A silence fell between them as Zack contemplated her words and intent. Using his years of experience at deflecting girls at the bar, he made his reply. 

"I guess I'm lucky I ended up with Mandy, then," he replied coolly. 

"Indeed," she replied, "Although I am surprised, though. Cause you don't seem like the guy who'd be happy with a girl. I can totally see you locked up in the grips of a good woman." 

"I'm good, thanks," Zack replied, eager for her to end this line of questioning. She leaned in close and brought her lips to his ear. 

"Are you?" she whispered, pulling him even closer scrubbing her belly against his torso slightly, revealing the effect her words had on him, specifically the fact that his tremendous erection was now pressing into her firm belly. 

"I, uh..." Zack stammered, pushing his body away from her, but she snapped into action, pulling him back in against her. 

"It's okay, baby," Vanessa said with a knowing smile, savoring the feeling of his fat white cock pressing her belly. She was very, very impressed with his size. It was huge, and it felt like the tip of his clothed dick was just a hair away from grazing her bulging tits. "It's always flattering when a young, handsome man like yourself can really appreciate an old lady like me," she joked, knowing she was far from an old lady. 

"Sorry, I..." he began, flustered around a woman in a way he hadn't been in a long time. 

"It's alright," she replied, smiling wide as she slid her belly against his jutting dick, sending a wave of pleasure through him. He panicked, looking around, hoping no one else noticed. No one was looking at him, and luckily, his wife had her back to him as she danced with one of the other groomsmen. 

"What are you doing?" he whispered harshly. She pressed herself against him again, putting pressure on his hard dick. She looked at him knowingly, eyes flashing with mischief. 

"I'm just making sure that my secretary married a good man, and not a dirty dog who'll break her heart," Vanessa said, smiling like the cat who caught the canary. "And I think I have my answer." 

"It's not what you think," Zack stated, not fully understanding why his wife's boss was so happy with this revelation. "I know it, uh, looks bad, but we've, just, uh, been holding off for a bit till our wedding night." 

"Oh, okay, that makes sense," she replied with a smirking nod, slipping her hands around the married man's tie. "But, if that isn't the case, and you do have a bit of a wondering eye..." she paused, tugging on his tie, yanking his head down so his gaze landed firmly in her cleavage. "Don't be so obvious about it..." He allowed his eyes to stare for a moment at her enormous, smooth black breasts before ripping his gaze away, meeting hers. "Or else you'll give someone the wrong idea." 

A heated silence fell between them for a moment as they danced. Mandy was looking at them, watching them talk as she danced with one of Zack's friends. She didn't know what was going on, or why they'd be talking in such rushed whispers, but it made her concerned. 

"I think you have the wrong idea," Zack said. 

"Do I?" Vanessa replied in a harsh whisper. They looked at each for a moment, their eyes reading each others', trying to decipher what they were seeing. Was she flirting with him, or giving him a word of warning? He couldn't tell. She was greatly enjoying his confusion and lust-filled torment. She needed him to start thinking with his dick, and she was well on her way to accomplishing that goal. 

"Yes, you do!" Zack affirmed, his hard cock telling another story. She paused for a moment, studying him for a few beats, before giving him a smile. "And quite frankly, I don't think this is really the right kind of conversation to be having at my wedding reception!" he added, standing up to this imposing older woman. Knowing her reputation enough to know that she probably wasn't used to being stood up to, part of him was afraid of her response. This was the woman who had bankrolled this entire wedding, it probably wasn't a good idea to make her mad. Her expression was unreadable for a few moments before her lips parted into a bright smile. 

"Ooh, I like you," Vanessa replied, she said, stepping back ever so slightly so his rock hard bulge wasn't pressed against her, easing the pressure. "Alright, you check out. You passed the test. And you've got some spine in you, just like Mandy." 

"Is this, like, a game, or something?" he asked, confused, but being careful to keep his tone calm and not come across as too upset. 

"Well, I wouldn't be much of a maid of honor if I didn't scope out her man a bit. Push your buttons a bit, see what happens. Making sure you are as good as she says you are." Vanessa replied. 

"And what are you gonna tell her?" Zack asked, knowing that she had caught him in some slightly embarrassing moments. She laughed and looked at him warmly. 

"It's okay, I believe you," she said. "How, uh... Big Zack... reacted, well... that can be our little secret, I think. Mandy doesn't need to know her boss's body got her hubby rock hard! I'll have to file that little morsel of knowledge away. Just make sure you behave yourself around your wife, and she'll never know a thing." 

"Oh, uh, well, I'm sure it won't ever have to come up," he stated, not loving the fact that his wife's boss had this slight bit of power over her. He looked at her mischievous eyes and tried to appraise her. He appreciated all the help with the wedding, and her taking such a shine to Mandy, but something about her made him just... uncomfortable. It was not only her hot black body, which made him ogle her like a horny teenager, but it was her strange playful demeanor that really threw him off kilter. It was like she was a predator, toying with her next meal. He still didn't fully know what to make of her. 

But he was about to. 

After a few moments of silence as they continued to dance, she spoke up again. "It's probably for the best that we cleared this up now. Cause I'm not gonna lie, with the way you were looking at me earlier, I was fixin' to take this a whole lot further. Haha!" 

"What do you mean?" Zack asked, confused. 

"What I mean is, with the way you were staring at me back at the church, I was thinking you'd be up for a bit of fun." Vanessa said, her voice silky smooth as her hips moved gracefully. "No lie, I was trying to think up an excuse to get you to look at my bare tits, but luckily, we cleared this whole thing up first. I suppose these suckers will just have to remain covered," she finished, glancing down at her own jutting rack. 

"Wait... how far were you willing to go?" Zack asked, curious. 

"All the way, baby," Vanessa replied, her tone more firm and serious. "Like I said, you're wife's a lucky woman. I'm sure many women would do anything to take her place..." 

Zack studied her for a few moments. Knowing that they were touching on something more serious, his defenses fully bloomed. 

"Are you one of those bad women?" Zack asked. "The ones you warned me about..." 

"Hon, in business, and in life, you don't get anywhere being nice. You play to win." Vanessa explained. "I'm a CEO of a fortune 500 company. Trust me, baby, I am the farthest thing from nice. All's fair in love and war. When a hot white stud like you comes along... mmm, mmm. Baby, I bet you make all sorts of women want to do some bad things." 

Zack began realizing he was in the clutches of a woman who was very dangerous. Sure, she had bankrolled this entire wedding out of some fondness for Mandy, but that bit of kindness wasn't enough to stop her from playing dirty. And she was playing very dirty, confessing that she was willing to go all the way with a freshly married man. She wanted him to see her dark, naked, succulent black flesh. He had so easily pushed aside women like Megan and Trina, but something about Vanessa, her power, her demeanor, and her luscious black skin, made her seem far more a threat to his fidelity. 

"Oh, c'mon babe, don't be naïve. You know the score." Vanessa said, laughing, her hard nipples grazing his chest. "I can read you like a book. I know exactly what type of man you are. I've seen it. You will always make women melt, married or not. You can't help it. Young or old. White, Asian... or Black," she paused, giving him a pointed expression. "You're a man who appeals to all types, and with those wondering eyes, and the way Big Zack down there throbs around the nearest pair of big tits, one of these days, you're gonna cross the wrong bitch, and once you do, they'll be no coming back. You'll be done." 

"Why are you telling me this?" Zack responded. 

"I am telling you this..." she began. "Because I understand how this world works, in a way your wife might not see. So if you do mess around, all I ask is that you keep it discrete. If I have to go in to work, and find that girl sobbing at her desk, then it affects me. And I can't have that." 

This was why she was warning him? Just so it wouldn't affect her life? Zack was quickly realizing how cold and cutthroat she actually was. 

"I'm not gonna mess around!" Zack affirmed again, slightly losing his cool. Watching from afar, Mandy could sense her husband's consternation as she danced with a relative, but she didn't know the cause. Vanessa was undeterred. 

"It's a shame, though," she began with a smirk. "I must confess, I've been thinking a LOT about you since we first met. I can't stop thinking about it, to be honest. And me and you, together... boy, I could have rocked your world, haha. You wouldn't have had to look anywhere else for some good loving. And honey, I would have done it all with you. With a stud like you, you just got to. I mean, I was THIS close to letting you see me completely naked. Like, you would have seen it all. I was this close to just fucking smothering you with my huge black tits. If I had pulled the trigger, we'd be in a bathroom stall with your dick up my ass! Haha!" Zack was startled into silence at her blunt honesty here. "We could have gone all night and never have done the same thing twice. I would have broken you down completely till you couldn't see straight! I would have made you depend on my body to live!" She paused, letting this sink into the startled married man. "So thank goodness we cleared this whole thing up before I got carried away. Like you said, you're not that type of guy, so that stuff will never happen. You're a good boy. Shame..." Zack was perplexed by this speech, and shocked that she could think that it was totally cool to admit that she was contemplating seducing him. That she had been fantasizing about all the things she would do to him in the bedroom. Zack had never dealt with anyone quite like this, and he didn't know how to respond.  

===

Finally, the song ended, and she stepped back, smiling that bright teasing smile of hers. Zack was both eager to get away, but frozen in place by this imposing black woman. She reached up to straighten the knot on his tie. 

"Like I said, you need to be careful," she warned him. "There are women everywhere, eager to swoop in and scoop you up. If you want to be a good husband, you need to keep it in your pants. Don't give any of those girls even an inch. Keep your eyes on your wife and don't even think about any other woman. Don't play the game with any of those scheming bitches unless you're willing to sink balls deep inside them. And, finally, and most importantly, don't stare at my ass when I walk away, or else you're really gonna regret what you missed out on." 

Vanessa released him from her clutches and gave him one more knowing look before sauntering away. And Zack's eyes... they were absolutely glued to Vanessa's round, juicy ass, following it as it bounced side to side as she walked. Studying each full, round cheek, and the delectable crevasse in between, teased by her thin, shimmering gold dress. Despite her warning, and despite knowing better, he couldn't look away from this glorious sight. 

Zack had never seen an ass that luscious and imposing. A younger version of him, the one who was drowning in hot pussy, would have given anything to experience an ass like that. To have sex with an ass like that. But an ass like that would never be found on some twiggy high school slut. No. Turns out, that round, juicy, perfect ass was housed on his wife's hot, forty-something black boss, who also happened to be extremely gorgeous, devious, and also had magnificent, perfect, massive breasts that were each nearly as big as his head. A younger, more naive Zack would have been mincemeat for a woman with that body. 

It's a good thing Zack wasn't that guy anymore. 

Zack was slightly shaken as he danced with a few of the other bridesmaids. Despite their close proximity, Zack couldn't focus on these young, slim, pretty white bridesmaids. None of them had nearly the same affect. No, his vision and his thoughts were focused on black women. It was at this point that he really regretted growing up in such a lilywhite community. He really wished he had been approached or propositioned by a black woman much earlier in his life, just so he could have gotten this sudden fascination and lust out of his system already, so it wouldn't be such a big deal here, on his wedding day. Because now, being confronted by the raw natural sexuality that only a confident black woman could possess, he was truly taken aback. He was so knocked off kilter than he couldn't think straight. He could only think about enormous black breasts. Amazing, round, black juicy asses. Luscious, smooth black flesh. 

He looked around, and it was clear that he wasn't the only white guy undergoing this battle. It seemed like everywhere he looked, he saw busty black women chatting up young, handsome white men. Friends of his or Mandy's, some guys he didn't know, some of the workers, some that he knew had wives or girlfriends, it seemed like all they were all being flirted with by black women. There were a lot of skimpy, figure hugging dresses, and exposed black flesh. And there were a lot very appreciative white men, staring and gawking, some being subtle, some unable to pull their eyes away from all the exposed black cleavage. It was as if Vanessa called up all her black female friends to throw on some slutty dresses, and come to the meat market that was a wedding reception. He saw one of his buddies, one of his fellow groomsmen, getting flirted with by an older black woman who was probably close to his mother's age. He saw a younger black woman, who Zack was pretty sure was a famous singer, pushing out her bulbous black tits at the handsome white bartender, and he was staring greedily. And in a far corner, a much older black woman was making out deeply with a white waiter half her age. But the thing that caught his attention most of all, is that when he scanned the room and noted these heated interracial moments, each time, the woman's eyes would turn to face him. As if the white men they had paired off with were merely proxies, standing in for the white man they really wanted. 

With all this sexy, black temptation around, all Zack could think about is how much easier this whole thing would be if he had already done it with a black girl and erased any curiosity of how good it would be. He heard rumors of some guys back in high school going a few towns over to hook up with some black girls. The ones that they heard rumors about, the ones that were supposedly total sluts who did ANYTHING! Zack never had to do that much work to get laid, to be honest, and with the way those bratty high school sluts he hung around with talked about those friends who went black and the insults they lobbed at those rumored trashy black girls two towns over, Zack knew any white guy willing to cross that line risked becoming a social pariah, which in high school was the worst thing possible. So, Zack never really considered hooking up with a black girl, and he had never been so directly confronted by one in this manner till now. 

The guys that he knew had hooked up with black girls seemed absolutely hooked, so there had to be something special there. Something different. Something possibly better. Zack just wished he knew. He wished he had buried his thick, nine-inch white dick balls deep into a tight black pussy. He wished he had felt a black woman's lips wrapped around the base of his shaft as she inhaled the massive white meat down her tight throat, her hungry eyes meeting his as she savored the flavor of his thick white cock. He wished he had buried his throbbing prick up a black girl's tight ass. He wished he held felt the undeniable pleasure of having his cock swallowed up between a pair of massive black tits. He wished he had sprayed a thick creamy load of white cum all over a pair of big black breasts, only able to imagine how amazing it would look on naked black skin. 

Mandy had been shunted off to the side, tipsily dancing with her husband's much older, overweight uncle, and her husband wasn't thinking about her at all. He was thinking about black women, voluptuous, naked black women, and all the wonderful and amazing things they could do to him and his fat white cock. Things that white girls simply did not know how to do. Mandy was thinking about how uncomfortable she was being a background player at her own wedding. Zack was thinking about spraying a huge load of thick white cum onto a pair of huge, naked black breasts. 

Vanessa was clearly winning the battle for Zack's soul. 

Finally able to clear his thoughts and escape the dance floor, he rejoined his wife and moved to head back towards their table. He needed to clear his head. Working at a bar, he would often down a strong drink on extra crazy days to soothe his nerves, so when he passed by a waitress offering drinks, he ordered a whiskey without hesitation. But, judging by the slight stumble in her step, he could tell Mandy had had one too many. He knew she wasn't a big drinker, so he was happy to get her sat back down and off her feet. Zack worked point, holding off the surprisingly aggressive wait staff that were seemingly eager to feed her more booze. He downed the drink given to him and tried to shake away his earlier thoughts. He and Mandy made small talk, reaching the point where they were both getting more and more antsy to just get out of there and have some privacy. Both were really feeling the pressure, Zack for obvious reasons, and Mandy for less obvious ones. She was again seeing evidence of how women seemed to behave around her handsome husband. Even her mature, confident boss seemed to like him, pushing herself in during their dance, and sharing what seemed to be intimate, teasing conversation. Mandy was eager to finally seal the deal, both to stake out her claim in Zack, as well as soothing her own physical needs. She leaned in close to him, putting her lips near his ear. 

"I can't wait to get out of here..." Mandy whispered, the alcohol in her system emboldening her. "I want to peel this suit off of you," she teased, kissing his ear. He shivered. She wasn't normally this flirtatious, so he enjoyed seeing this side of her. Her turned to her and kissed her cheek, before moving his mouth to her ear. 

"I've been thinking about this night for months now," he began. "This night's gonna be unforgettable." He told her. The newlyweds continued to innocently, adorably flirt as the party went on around them. Any nerves the two were feeling were quickly forgotten as they were finally able to have a little privacy, a little time to themselves. This felt right. This felt good. Despite all the craziness of this day, it was at this moment that everything felt as it should be. This was how this special day was supposed to feel. 

This moment was perfect. 

As Zack refocused on his wife, his earlier thoughts of voluptuous, sexy black women were pushed to the background. Looking back, he almost couldn't explain what had happened, but whatever, it was done. Over. That momentary bit of insanity now behind him, he refocused his mind on his new wife and their future together. Everything was going great. 

And then Vanessa sat in his lap. 

He didn't even see her coming. One moment, the happy couple were hunched together, whispering to each other, and then all of a sudden, Vanessa appeared, pushing her way between them, and as Zack sat back in surprise, she took advantage, planting her round, juicy, voluptuous black ass directly in his lap. Zack audibly grunted as he felt her weight land squarely on his crotch. Due to the heated conversation he and Mandy had been having, he had been partly stiff. But now, feeling the pressure of her weight, combined with the fact that her juicy, round ass felt practically bare due to her thin dress, allowing him to feel every curve of its perfect shape... needless to say, his big white cock was progressing from partly stiff to throbbing obscenely. And Vanessa could feel it. 

"Ooh..." she cooed, grinding her butt into his bulge, feeling his slab of meat against the crack of her ass. This motion was subtle enough for Mandy not to notice, but to Zack... his entire focus was now on the round ass grinding against his cock. That was until she wrapped her arm around his neck and leaned into him, as if they were close friends. This movement subtly allowed her enormous, heavy breasts to press against his chest, while giving the newly married man a primo view of her cavernous cleavage, displayed proudly in front of him. 

"This is one hell of a party," Vanessa stated proudly, crossing her legs. "Maybe my best work yet." She glanced at her young secretary before giving a pointed look at Zack and sliding her huge breasts against his fit chest. Despite her discomfort at this whole event, Mandy put on a brave face. 

"Thanks so much, Vanessa," Mandy began, doing her best not to come across as drunk in front of her boss. "This is just incredible!" 

"Oh, it's nothing," Vanessa waved off, champagne flute in hand. "A fitting event for a couple such as yourselves. Although, I must say, you two are adorable together," she added, giving her secretary an excited look. "I didn't know what to expect, but... your hubby here... he's a real keeper," she said, glancing at the groom. 

"Oh, uh... thanks." Mandy said, blushing slightly, proud that her mature, experienced boss thought she had done a good job. That filled her with warm feelings and affection towards Vanessa. But her slightly inebriated state didn't allow her to realize that her husband hadn't said a single word since her black boss sat on his lap. He wasn't even paying attention, to be honest, at least not to his wife. 

No, he was staring at Vanessa's breasts. 

They were just so big! They looked almost obscenely big on her otherwise normal frame. They were just massive. And they were just so round, too. Her flesh was a smooth, sexy black, and it was almost glowing, coated with a slight sheen of perspiration, due to the hard work she was putting in working the room. They were begging to be touched, and it took all of Zack's iron will not to reach up and just squeeze the magnificent black jugs to his heart's content. And the low-cut dress allowed his eyes to be drawn into the massive chasm of cleavage where her mammoth orbs pressed together. That fucking cleavage was luscious and mouth-watering, and so fucking deep... you could dive deep in there and just be smothered in softness. 

They were the greatest pair of breasts he had ever seen, and he hadn't even seen them bare... yet. They were immaculate. They were works of art. None of the white women he had fucked had breasts that compared to these mammoth black tits, either in size, shape, or sexiness. In his twenties, Zack had learned the art of self-control, but these massive black tits in front of his face were making him lose that control. That, combined with the pressure her round ass was putting on his now fully erect cock, was making him think bad thoughts. He really wanted to see Vanessa's huge tits naked. Just a glimpse. Yeah, he was married, newly married, and yes, she was his wife's boss, but he just had to see her naked. He had to. Part of him wished he had played along with her just to get that far, so he could see her hot black body in the buff and commit that image to memory forever. He didn't want to cheat, he just had to see that body. 

He knew this was a dangerous line of thinking, because it had gotten him into trouble before. This was the exact line of thinking that led him to cheating in his younger days. He would date a girl with big breasts, but he would end up talking himself into flirting with a girl, who just happened to have enormous breasts, and one thing would lead to another, and then... well, it always ended the same way. Hot, intense cheating sex. Zack remembered those times very well, but he also remembered the aftermath, which is why he had to be a better man now. Mandy was worth it. He had to stop thinking these dangerous thoughts, but it came with great difficulty, as Vanessa's cleavage was absolutely mouth- watering. 

So he was staring at Vanessa's huge breasts pretty unashamedly, but frankly, no one could really blame him. His eyes were locked on her immense cleavage, trying to resist the urge to press his face into them in front of his wife. 

This moment really highlighted the differences in approach between the two women. Mandy was about gentle teasing and flirting with Zack. Vanessa was more blunt, sitting on Zack's lap, rubbing her large, full, juicy ass into his crotch while shoving her huge tits in his face. And it was clear which approach Zack preferred. 

But Mandy wasn't completely clueless, and she couldn't help but notice where his eyes were locked. She gulped, seeing him staring at another woman, with heat in his eyes. She couldn't say anything, for fear of ruining the moment and making things awkward, especially since it was her boss involved. She wasn't mad at Zack, well, she certainly wasn't pleased, but Vanessa's boobs were just pouring out of her dress. It would be hard for anyone not to look. But since Zack's attention was no longer on his wife, and his wife knew exactly where his attention was, when another drink ended up in front of her she eagerly gulped it down. Seeing this made Vanessa smile. She turned to face Zack and got his attention. 

"Alright, babe," Vanessa said, his eyes pulled up from her tits as she spoke to him. "Go take a walk, hon. Work the room. It's time for some girl talk." Zack was shaken from his reverie, and when he met her gaze, the confident, knowing glare she was giving him let him know he was caught staring, by both Vanessa and probably his wife. Blushing slightly as Vanessa stood up, he nodded. 

"That's probably a good idea," he grunted out, meeting neither of their eyes as he stood, checked himself and walked away. As Mandy watched Zack walk towards the center of the room, Vanessa took his place next to her. She wanted him next to her, so she was disappointed to see him walk away. But she had to feign happiness at having a few private moments with her boss and not with her hubby. 

"I'm not gonna lie," Vanessa began, talking in a low tone that one would use when sharing a secret off-the-record to someone. "You're a very, very lucky girl," she said, as both women turned to look at Zack walking away, both staring admiringly at Zack's cute butt. "That boy is a fine piece of ass. I am very impressed." 

"Oh, uh, thanks," Mandy said, blushing. 

"But, anyway," Vanessa said, leaning towards her young secretary, her huge black tits nearly spilling out of her dress, and even Mandy was gawking at those massive round orbs, despite herself. "Before you get to tonight, I wanted to talk to you," Vanessa began. 

"Okay," Mandy said, unsure of where this was going. 

"As a woman who's been married four times, I wanted to give you some wisdom, and talk to you about things I suspect you haven't really talked about," Vanessa began. "As you know, tonight will be a big night for you two. I just wanted to stress how important this night is really. It is vital that you make this night unforgettable for him." 

"Oh yeah?" Mandy asked, slightly confused. 

"This is something I wish someone had told me," Vanessa began, barely keeping a straight face. "I have a good sense of people, so I feel pretty confident in saying that your boy there..." she said, nodding at Zack, as he was being chatted up by Naomi. Vanessa noticed the way Naomi was teasing the strap of her dress, causing her huge black breasts to jiggle. Bitch, she had best not be getting her hands on Vanessa's man. Vanessa refocused on Mandy. "Zack's a bit of a lady-killer. I bet that boy's seen a lot of action in his day. I mean, I've seen it here today. Look, that bitch over there is a literal billionaire, and she is flirting with him. He doesn't even have to try, and he isn't. Women fall all over him, and I bet a younger Zack was happy to indulge. He's done a lot, with a lot of women, so he knows what he's doing." 

"Why are you telling me this?" Mandy asked. 

"I am telling you this because a man like that, despite what he might ever say to you... he will have certain expectations of your sex life. Tonight is a showcase to him of your future together. You need to show him you've got some surprises in your back pocket. You can't give up all your tricks, but he needs to know they are there." 

"Tricks?" Mandy asked. 

"You know... you can't just do the same thing every night. The only way you could do that is if you are really confident you can rock his world night after night. But if that's not the case, then you've got to let him know that there is potential for everything. He needs to know that you are willing to give him everything. A guy like him needs to know that he will never get better love than what he's getting at home. It is vital he knows that." Vanessa told him. 

"What do you suggest?" Mandy asked, worry crossing her face. Vanessa almost smiled. 

"Quite honestly, you need to push your limits," Vanessa began. "You need to become the master of his dick." She said, her crass language stunning the young wife. "You need to learn how to take his dick down your throat. You need to worship his dick and balls. You need to learn to take his creamy load wherever he wants to give it. You need to learn to give it to him hard and rough. And most importantly, you need to give him your ass." 

"What?" Mandy asked, the blood leaving her face. "I am not interested in that kind of thing, and he's never mentioned it to me." 

"Of course he would never ask you for it, but that doesn't mean he doesn't want it." Vanessa said. "I know it might be intimidating, but it's a cutthroat world out there, and if you don't give it to him, some other eager little slut will. These are the things women have to do these days to hold onto a man."  

===

Mandy gulped, looking down at the ground. Was she serious? Did Zack expect these kind of things from her? Looking away from Vanessa, she didn't see the older woman snap her fingers to get Trina's attention, and soon enough a hard drink was placed in front of the nervous wife, which she eagerly gulped down. 

"Hon, don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable at first, but you will learn to love it. Trust me," Vanessa assured knowingly, conveying the pleasures of anal sex to the young bride. "And beyond that, you need to keep your body in tip-top shape. Keep your butt nice and pert. And make your wardrobe revealing. He's your husband. He wants to see your body, and he likes knowing you will give it to him. Show off what you have." 

"Well, uh," she stammered, both nervous and drunk. She shook her head to clear the cobwebs. "I mean, do you really think that's necessary?" she asked, slurring her S's. "I mean, I am happy with myself, but if he wanted someone with a super hot body, he wouldn't have picked me," Mandy said, her own personal body issues being dragged to the surface. 

"Hon, even the best guys love big tits," Vanessa said condescendingly. "And the nicest guys probably also love round, juicy asses. Listen... do what you can to keep yourself in top shape, and if you start to see his eye wandering... well," Vanessa paused and looked down at Mandy's unimpressive chest. "I mean no offense, hon, but I know a bitch who can hook you up with a pair of fakes as big as your head that look insanely real. Let me know, and I can hook you up with her." 

"Issh that where you got yours?" Mandy asked, lashing out, a bit hurt by her boss's comment, and a bit emboldened by alcohol. 

"No, baby, mine all are real," Vanessa said, cupping her own prodigious rack and squeezing them lightly. "I don't say this to be a bitch. I'm just looking out for you," Vanessa said, playing up her motherly instincts, watching the nervous and scared young woman gulping down more and more booze. 

"I... I... I..." Mandy stammered, her eyes tearing up. "Are you sure he would feel this way?" 

"Oh hon, don't cry," Vanessa said, smiling, her dark intentions hidden behind her grin. "I don't mean to scare ya. These are just things the modern woman has to keep in mind. It's a tough pill to swallow, but you need to hear it." Vanessa's plan was working to a T. She was making this young woman nervous and scared, destroying her self-confidence and inserting the rightful fear that she is not enough for her man. Force that bitch to keep sucking down liquid courage, make her drink herself stupid on her wedding night, taking herself out of the picture, and by the time her head clears, it will be too late. 

Zack will belong to Vanessa. 

Mandy was suddenly terrified of what was to come. What if she wasn't good enough? What if Zack was just placating her, and he really wanted someone with much more copious curves? What if he was unsatisfied with her? Mandy glanced out into the morass of people, till she spotted her husband, talking with that pushy bitch Trina again. The one with the big tits and the smooth, round jutting ass. The fear and her feelings of inadequacy suddenly hit her, and tears starting flowing down her cheeks. Seeing this, Vanessa moved to act. 

"Let's go, hon," Vanessa stated, pulling Mandy to her feet. "You don't wanna ruin you're make-up." 

Vanessa pulled a stumbling, clearly drunk Mandy towards the rest room. When they reached the restroom and had a few moments of privacy where Vanessa helped her touch up her make-up, she spoke up again. 

"I'm sorry, hon..." Vanessa began, "I didn't mean to make you cry. It's the same as always. I'm trying to toughen you up. Some of this stuff might sound daunting, or scary, but it's the truth. It's harder than ever to be married. Trust me. I'm just stating the facts. So many marriages end because the wife has itty, bitty, titties, or an ass as flat as a board." Vanessa stated, smiling inside as she insulted the young wife to her face. The sensation was deliciously evil. "Some marriages end because the wife doesn't like cum, or she's not willing to take a dick up her ass. And then again, some marriages end even if you do all those things, and the good sex only delays the inevitable." she said, speaking to her own experiences. "Landing a man is the easy part. Keeping them is the hard part. I'm just preparing you." Vanessa finished up on Mandy's face. 

"Thankshhh, Fanessha," Mandy slurred, the alcohol really hitting her, smiling gratefully at her boss, drunkenly appreciating this strange advice, not realizing how misguided it was. 

"My pleasure," Vanessa replied. "By the way," she began, reaching into her purse. "I snuck a flask of some really good stuff into the building. Stuff you can't even buy in this country. Here, take a sip," Vanessa urged. 

"I don't know..." Mandy said. "If I drink anymore, I'm gonna passhh out." 

"Nonsense," Vanessa replied. "Take a drink." She replied more firmly, insistently. 

As soon as the booze passed Mandy's lips, Vanessa knew she was done for. She was about to be knocked on her ass, and there was now nothing standing in Vanessa's way of getting her hands on that fat white dick. 

************ 

Vanessa led Mandy back into the reception hall. Mandy could barely stand she was so drunk, and a concerned Zack located them upon their entry. 

He was eager for the distraction, because he wasn't getting respite among the wedding guests. He went from staring at Vanessa's massive knockers, to going out on the floor and seeing even more succulent black breasts. He talked to Naomi, one of the most famous people in the world, and all he could think about is how he had never realized how huge her black tits were. And it wasn't just her. He talked to this famous young black actress, and she was super flirty, slipping him her phone number under the guise of getting movie parts. It just went on and on. All the women here, all the black women, seemed to make it a point to chat him up and flirt with him. He was happy for an excuse to get away, even if it appeared his wife was worse for wear. 

"What happened?" Zack asked. 

"Well, I think she got a bit carried away," Vanessa stated. "She was a bit overserved. The poor thing can barely stand." Zack was clearly annoyed upon hearing this, and he gave a skeptical look to Vanessa. Remembering their strange interactions so far, he couldn't help but think this was part of some plan of hers. "I think it's time for her to get some rest. It's been a long day. I've already arranged a limo to take us to the hotel." 

"I can handle this, Vanessa," Zack stated, wanting to be rid of this amazingly sexy older black woman. He could barely bring himself to look at her, knowing how his brain seemed to shut down around her. He just needed to get away from Vanessa for good, and be alone with his wife, then everything would be okay. Then he could move on from this strange day. 

"Nonsense," Vanessa said, brushing him off. "I'm the maid of honor. That's what I'm here for. Besides, everything's in my name, so I have to sign off for you guys at the hotel." 

Although still skeptical, Zack relented. He couldn't think of any polite way to decline, so he just went with it. 

"Okay," he replied. "Should I, you know, say goodbye or something?" he asked, looking back towards the reception. 

"Well, at the rate they're going, I'm sure they won't even notice you're gone." Vanessa stated bluntly, implicitly admitting that this party wasn't really ever about them. Zack nodded in agreement, took his wife and threw her arm around his shoulder and supported her as they left the banquet hall. Vanessa led the way, and while Zack mainly focused on supporting his drunken wife, and listening to her drunken ramblings, his eyes were glued once again on Vanessa's hot ass, which bounced side-to-side as she sashayed down the hall. He couldn't help but let his eyes linger on the round, full cheeks. With the way her dress showed every curve of her body, he could see every inch of her ass, and the way it bounced succulently as she walked. 

He had just gotten married to a young woman who understood him more than any other girl ever had before. She strengthened him and made him a better person. This should be the greatest day of his life, and he should be totally content, but he could not take his eyes off this forty-something black woman. Ever since he had first seen her, she had dominated his thoughts, occupying the thoughts that should be focused on his wife. And as he looked at her hypnotic ass, shaking side-to-side, the firm flesh jiggling juicily, more thoughts rose to the surface. 

Memories of his younger days and his days as a player. As he supported his drunken wife, he remembered some of his old hook-ups. Vanessa's round, jiggling ass stirred up old memories, of the things those filthy girls he used to date did, and the things they demanded of him in bed. The way they would shake their butts at him to get his attention, just like Vanessa was. And when things got more serious, and they would shake their almost bare, thong-clad asses at him, shoving their butts in his face. And when things got even more serious, and all the clothes hit the floor, Zack would sink even further under their thrall, as they eagerly held his face against their asses, his face smothered between the cheeks, his tongue worshipping their assholes, rimming the tight holes as their hands would grip his scalp, holding him in place, establishing their dominance over him. This happened again and again, with multiple girls. This wasn't a beginner's move. This was advanced stuff, and all these high school sluts knew it. Knew it and loved it. At first, Zack wasn't exactly eager to perform this act, but eventually, after being forced to perform this act again and again, he had no choice but to become addicted to it, eventually becoming very eager and very willing, his tongue lavishly traversing the crack of a girl's ass, coating it with saliva. The sensation of warmth of being pressed against two round ass cheeks, of the nastiness of the act, it all grew into a delicious cocktail of illicit lust. He loved it. Even though it had been years since he had done that kinda thing, when he saw a nice, full, juicy ass shaking in front of him on the street, or in the bar, Zack's mouth would still water. 

Looking at Vanessa's ass, he was positively drooling. 

Vanessa's ass was superior to any other ass he had ever seen. Those thin little white girls he used to hook up with didn't have butts that compared to Vanessa's perfectly formed, firm, jiggly ass. Zack imagined getting behind her, pulling her gold dress up over that ripe, round, juicy ass so it was exposed in front of him, in the flesh. He would eagerly pull the cheeks apart, exposing her sexy, ass crack, and he would feast on her asshole, rimming the tight hole, worshipping it with his tongue. His masculine face would be smothered against her full, firm black ass. Vanessa would grab his scalp just like those young girls, forcing his face against her butt, forcing him to worship it, making him rim her tight asshole, screaming out every swear word in the book as she made the young white groom a slave to her hot ass. 

Zack had to look away from Vanessa's rear so he could shake those wicked thoughts from his mind. He had to refocus on his wife, and getting her out of there and back to the hotel where they could be alone and in private and free of his wife's hot-bodied black boss. 

He wouldn't be so lucky. 

The drive back didn't provide much respite. Vanessa had her personal driver driving the limo back, and as Vanessa sipped champagne, she made small talk with the new couple. It was difficult to extract much conversation from Mandy at this point, but her presence insured that Vanessa behaved herself with Zack, at least for now. Zack was more focused on comforting his wife and making sure she was okay. And due to the weird tension between him and Vanessa, he kept his responses to her brief, preferring silence or the small interactions with his wife. But as much as he tried to ignore Vanessa, her massive breasts in that severely low-cut gold dress made that task impossible. 

The ride was a bumpy one, and it felt like the hydraulics in the car were directly connected to Vanessa's mammoth tits. Every bump in the road sent a mouth-watering ripple through her bulbous black breasts. He tried to look away, but his eyes kept arriving at her canyon-like cleavage. The way the smooth, dark flesh would jiggle in such a rhythmic manner was damn near hypnotic. He couldn't look away. Zack was sure Vanessa knew exactly what was going on, with the way she jutted out her chest, hoping to have her protruding, magnificent rack be appreciated. Vanessa didn't say anything in front of Mandy, but her coy expression and piercing gaze told him he had been caught in the act. Mandy was too drunk to notice the cause of her husband's distraction. 

Zack had a lot of experience with large breasts. A lot of the scheming young women he used to date just happened to have huge breasts. Not large enough to compare with Vanessa's enormous pair, but pretty huge nonetheless. Big boobs initially were never a big turn-on for Zack, but the more experience he had with them, the more addicted he became. Their softness... the way they felt in his hands... the way the soft flesh would pour over his palms... or mold against his face as he drowned in their luscious flesh, hos mouth closed around a nipple... the way they would smother every inch of his cock with soft, heated skin... the way they looked coated with streams of his thick cum... there was no denying their appeal. By the time he escaped out the other side from all these slutty young women, he had been converted to a big breasts connoisseur. It had become a bone-deep fetish, enough to make his cock throb and turn to iron. 

His stance on big breasts had softened in the subsequent years, clearly evidenced by his new marriage to his VERY flat-chested wife. Sure, big-boobed girls still seemed to swarm to him. It was as if those women saw his handsome, chiseled features and felt an undeniable urge to rub their huge boobs against them. They saw his big, firm hands and felt a subconscious need to fill them with soft, succulent tits. But Zack saw these massive cup sizes as a symbol of the type of girl he didn't want to fraternize with anymore. He didn't want to lose control of himself or his sexual desires as he did with those scheming, big-titted women. He didn't want a relationship that was so dominated by sex. He wanted something deeper and more fulfilling than that. It didn't matter if a girl had a flat chest if she fulfilled him in other ways, like Mandy did. Sure, it would certainly be nice if she had big boobs, but it wasn't a requirement. He would be a happy and satisfied man either way, but part of him was relieved to see Mandy's chest was so underdeveloped. 

Now, some deep smooth cleavage displayed lewdly would still catch his eye in his weaker moments, and would send a sizzle of lust down the length of his cock, but he didn't drool over a pair of big tits like he used to. He was an adult man, and he could handle a pair of big boobs in his presence without staring. He figured he had conquered that side of himself. 

That being said, he had never been confronted by a pair of breasts like Vanessa's. They were so much bigger... so much softer... so much more... Black. And despite his years of growth, he was struggling to look away. He was drooling over them. That dark side of him was re-emerging, the side of him that had been dormant for years. The side of him that loved the old days. That loved the kind of aggressive, rough sex he used to have with very slutty young women. That side of him... it wanted to do some bad things with Vanessa. That side of him wanted to have sex with Vanessa. He wanted to bury his thick married cock in her tight, wet vagina. Even though she was in her forties. And his wife's boss. And she was black. These things might be obstacles for some, but Zack's inner stud was running wild. 

He wanted to feel her luscious, naked body against his. He wanted her naked black flesh to slide against his, sweat coating their naked bodies, their glistening skin shining as they fucked each others' brains out. He wanted to feel her massive black breasts in his meaty palms, squeezing them roughly, just the way she wanted it. He wanted to press his face between her soft breasts and feel their soft flesh molding to his face. He wanted to feel her plump lips around the root of his thick white cock as she swallowed it to the base. He wanted to drive his thick shaft to the balls inside her tight, wet black cunt. He wanted to feel her black cunt squeezing every inch of his cock. He wanted to rim her tight asshole with his married mouth before fucking that amazing ass with his thick married dick, using his weapon to give that ass the pleasure it so deserved. He wanted to coat her massive black tits with his thick white cum. He wanted to be fucked into submission by his wife's luscious, hot bodied, devious black boss, and be stolen from his girl like he had been so many times in his younger days. 

How long could Zack keep that side of him at bay? 

Zack did his best to hide the nervous gulp as he looked away from Vanessa's cleavage. But while he was in turmoil, Vanessa kept her cool eyes on the happy couple with a smirk on her face. Zack noticed this, and it caused his blood to boil. 

It seemed like despite his best efforts, things just kept working out in her favor. Everything just kept playing into her hands. He and Mandy had a small, humble wedding planned, but as soon as Vanessa got involved everything changed. It was moved to a church that Vanessa picked out. The reception was at a banquet hall that she picked out, catered by a group that she picked out. Filled with friends of hers, friends that didn't care the least about the happy couple. The reception was less of a celebration of marriage than it was a way for Vanessa to throw a party for all her friends, where she could mingle, show off her wealth, and finalize business deals. 

And on a personal level, ever since Zack had first met her, he just couldn't shake her. She had been flirting and teasing him all day, playing some weird, strange, seductive game with him that he didn't fully understand yet. She was obviously aware that he was married, but that didn't stop her. She interjected herself between the happy couple on the dance floor. She planted her juicy butt in his lap next to his wife, grinding her round ass into his sizable bulge. And now, she had finagled her way into being present at the hotel where the marital suite was located. Zack just couldn't find a way to push her away, and he knew deep down that if he didn't stop this now, there was no telling where it would end. In the wedding suite? The wedding bed? Zack resolved to do anything he could to get Vanessa out of the picture before that point, before he made a really bad mistake that he would regret for the rest of his life. 

He tried to focus on his wife, but she was barely conscious at this point. Her eyes kept lidding over, and her brow was moist with perspiration, the alcohol doing its number on her. Zack tried talking to her, trying to keep her awake and focused, but it was a losing battle. As Zack rubbed her shoulder and tried to keep up a conversation about their honeymoon plans, he saw her fading fast. It was at this point that Vanessa spoke up, sensing an opportunity. 

"You're a very lucky woman, Mandy," Vanessa said. Waiting for a reply that wasn't coming, Vanessa continued. "I didn't expect your husband to be so... sexy," she stated, looking at Zack with amusement in her eyes as he gave her an angry look in response. 

"Uhnnn..." groaned Mandy through closed eyes, barely feeling anything at this point. Smiling 0 

===

"I must admit, hon... you've made an old lady like me jealous," Vanessa said. "You have no idea what I would do to get a man like him..." she said, trailing off, holding his eyes with her own. Mandy bent over slightly, rubbing her hand across her forehead as she tried to ease her dizziness. "It's a shame you've embarrassed yourself in front of your husband and taken yourself out of commission, honey," the older black woman stated to her young secretary. "You gotta be careful, dear... a lot of the women back there were eyeing up your husband... if it wasn't for me, one of them would be angling to take your place in your bed tonight. I know that sounds bad, but it's the truth. Hell, if you weren't in the picture, I would do some very dirty things with your hunk of a husband." She raised her eyebrows at the young white husband, and he responded by giving her a warning glare, trying to stop her in her tracks. But she was undeterred. As he clutched his wife close to him, he steeled himself for her next onslaught. 

"I find your husband very, VERY attractive," Vanessa said, sipping a flute of champagne as she spoke. Knowing that Mandy would remember none of this due to her drunken stake, Vanessa didn't hold back. "Mmm, that's right, dear. Your husband is a fine-as-hell white man, and I can't stop thinking about having sex with him. Hot, sweaty, naked sex," she said, savoring the delicious words as they left her lips, her eyes holding Zack's. She raised her eyebrows at him, eyes twinkling with amusement, as if this was some sort of hilarious bit to her. Some sort of gag on his wife, taking advantage of her current state by having a bit of fun at her expense. 

"I can't stop thinking about running a decathlon on your husband's dick," she purred, testing the limits of what she could get away with in front of her newly married secretary. "Show him things he didn't know were possible. Teach him a thing or two about black sex, things you little white bitches don't know about. I want to rub my luscious, naked black skin against your husband's taut, naked, sexy white body. A white man as fine as him... it's hard to let him just pass by." 

"Vanessa..." Zack began, his tone steely. "Stop this, please. This isn't funny..." Her expression was unreadable to him. He didn't know if this was some sort of joke on her part, some sick prank, or if she was being deadly serious. "Let's just cut it out now and just forget about it. You've had your fun." 

"I haven't had my fun... yet," she teased. "And judging by her state, neither will you. Unless..." she trailed off, holding his eyes with hers again, letting that unspoken illicit option hang in the air. 

"Cut it out!" Zack said, his voice rising slightly as he got more upset by this game she was playing. 

"Oh, don't be so upset, baby," Vanessa purred, sipping her drink. "Don't act like you're not enjoying this. You love it! This is the type of fun people like us get to have." Her hard nipples were very evident beneath her thin, wispy, golden dress. "Do you want me to get into this here? Do you really want your wife to know the truth? About how much I turn you on? About how you can't stop thinking about my hot, mature black body? Don't try to act like you don't. Trust me, we both know the truth. I know how much you LOVE my amazing body. I felt nine inches of love pressed against me earlier..." 

"STOP!" Zack called out, making his nearly passed out wife stir. 

"Wwwwuuussshhhh gguuuingggg onnn?" she slurred out. Making sure she was too out of it to listen, Zack spoke up. 

"Vanessa, this isn't funny! This is... inappropriate and completely out of line. I married Mandy, and I am completely satisfied with her. Any... thing... that makes you think otherwise is just a... misunderstanding," Zack said strongly, despite knowing it was a weak argument. She clearly thought the same, simply raising her eyebrow and smirking knowingly in regards to how the married man was trying to play off his obvious lust for her. Zack's argument was again almost immediately undercut by the sudden stop of the limo, causing Zack's eyes to lock onto her massive black breasts as they jiggled lusciously before coming to a stop a few moments after the car did. She again caught him staring, giving him a knowing look just as the door was opened for her by the driver. She stepped out of the limo, flashing some bare leg at him as she did so. Zack steeled himself, stirred his wife, and stepped out of the limo, eager for the privacy of the hotel room. 

Zack was able to stir Mandy enough to get her to walk, with his support, into the hotel lobby. As they slowly walked into the expensive hotel, Zack spied his wife's statuesque boss at the front desk, chatting amiably with the well- dressed, attractive young woman behind the desk. Both of them looked back at the married couple pointedly, before the two women exchanged a knowing glance. She slid the room keys across the desk to Vanessa and gave her a nod. Zack didn't want to know what they were discussing. 

He really didn't. 

"Don't wear the poor guy out too bad," the young woman said to Vanessa. She had done business with Vanessa for a while, being fully aware of the older woman's proclivities and always being willing and ready to provide the powerful black woman an emergency hotel room for one of her many, steamy encounters. 

"That fine hunk of man won't be able to walk when I'm done with him," Vanessa boasted, causing the young professional to smile wickedly. Vanessa leaned over the desk conspiratorially, lowering her voice. "Come by the room in a few hours, and I'll let you lick his cum off my tits." 

"Ooohhhh," the young woman's eyes flashed with mischief as she smiled wickedly. Her eyes jumped from the hunky groom to the older black woman's prodigious bust. "I might have to take you up on that." 

Vanessa smiled at the young woman before turning away from her, eager to rejoin the object of her lust. She sauntered over towards the married couple, her bulbous breasts jiggling with every step. As she got in close, she deftly slid the two key cards into her deep valley of cleavage, tucking them in snugly between the massive black orbs. Zack tried not to stare, but he SO did. 

"You guys ready?" she asked. 

"Um... I think I can get it from here, Vanessa," Zack stated, still supporting his wife, and just eager to be done with this older black woman who kept making him think such filthy thoughts. Vanessa just looked at him for a few moments before replying. 

"Well, feel free to take the keys..." she replied, putting her hands on her hips, jutting out her chest, daring him to retrieve them from between her massive breasts. He looked at her huge black tits for a moment, trying to decide whether he could grab the keys without touching her smooth, dark, mouth- watering flesh. Seeing that the keys were wedged pretty deep, he looked up into her amused eyes, again giving her a stern glare. But it was for naught, as he again had no choice but to go along with her. She smirked and turned around, leading the couple to the elevator. 

They rode up to the top floor in silence. But even then, Vanessa stood out. In the close confines of the elevator, Vanessa's subtle, feminine, expensive perfume hit his nose, overtaking the perfume that Mandy was wearing. He always loved those girly perfumes on women, the vapor trail that lets you know a woman is around or had been here recently. It always sent a thrill through him, which probably had to do with the fact that he had had his nose buried between so many big teenage tits back in the day that those girly perfumes and scents always seemed to resonate in the pleasure center of his brain. 

As the elevator doors opened on the top floor of the fancy hotel, Vanessa stepped ahead of the couple, leading them down the hall. Finally able to get some fresh air in the quiet hallway, Zack was happy to follow. The hall was silent and unoccupied, and the loudest noise was the rhythmic clicking of Vanessa's heels on the hard stone floor. Following a few feet behind her, Zack supported Mandy as he led her to the honeymoon suite. 

"Issshhh tthhiiissshhh tha Baahhhhaammaaazzzz?" Mandy slurred out, her loud voice breaking through the silence. 

"No, hon, this is the hotel. We're heading to the Bahamas tomorrow." Zack replied. Vanessa was springing for both the fancy wedding suite at this expensive hotel and the honeymoon in the Bahamas, and despite his tension with her, he was grateful for her generosity. Before she interceded, their honeymoon was just them heading upstate to a quaint little city for a week at a nice, quiet lake house, and they were gonna spend their time hiking trails and just basking in nature. That was not nice enough for Vanessa's tastes, so she spoiled her young secretary with something nicer than she could ever afford. 

Vanessa looked back, her eyes appraising her drunken secretary, her eyes clearly indicating her disappointment in Mandy's current condition. She turned away from the couple and spoke up. 

"This is the best executive suite in the city," Vanessa spoke up. Zack's attention turned to her, and due to the fact that she wasn't facing them, he couldn't help but let his eyes fall to her mouth-watering ass. The full, round butt of his wife's older black boss arrested his vision as it bounced back and forth, each juicy cheek jiggling, their immaculate shape highlighted by the tight, thin golden dress. "You guys are lucky I have connections here, so I was able to book the room on such short notice," she continued, her attention focused on her cell phone as she texted away on it. "I always send other CEO's here when they're visiting. They were all blown away. It's a shame you won't be able to enjoy it more," Vanessa said, glancing back at the young woman. Zack again tried to avert his gaze from her juicy rear end before he would be caught, but he was again sure she noticed. She led them towards a room at the end of the hall, her ass shaking lusciously with every step. She deftly removed from a key card from her cleavage, and opened the door. Before Zack could object, she stepped inside and held the door open, letting the couple enter. As soon as they were all in the room, Vanessa closed the door and locked it. Hearing the click, Zack spoke up. 

"Vanessa, I think I have it from here," he stated, turning to face the older woman. 

"Nonsense," Vanessa began, setting down her small purse on a side table. "Your wife needs to get cleaned up and helped out of her dress, and I have yet to meet the man who knows his way around something like a wedding dress. Let us girls go into the bathroom, let me clean her up, and then... we can call it a night." Before Zack could respond, Vanessa eased over and took over support of the young drunk wife. 

"I can help her," Zack offered. 

"Hon... no man should see his wife in this state," she replied. "You don't want this image being the one you remember from your wedding night. Let me handle this." Zack didn't like it, but she had a point. Seeing him back off, Vanessa smiled and spoke up. "And while I'm doing that, fix me up a cocktail. I don't care what, just make it strong." With that, Vanessa eased Mandy into the bathroom and locked the door behind her. 

Now temporarily alone, Zack didn't know what to do. He wanted that woman out of here, but he didn't know how to do it. Rubbing his eyes in frustration, he turned away from the closed door, and it was only then that he noticed his surroundings. 

He didn't know what to expect with the executive suite but it was mighty impressive for someone with such humble beginnings. The room had a remarkable looking king size bed, a fully-stocked bar, marble floors, a huge flat-screen TV, some fancy looking furniture, and a balcony overlooking the city. There were nice, unique paintings on the wall and modern furnishings and decorations. This room oozed class and wealth, far beyond what he had ever experienced. From what he had been told, there was also a fancy hot tub in the bathroom. This room was amazing. It felt like a whole new world to the humble young man. It didn't feel like he was supposed to be here, as if he was trespassing. Vanessa had, like with everything else, footed the bill. And despite already displaying the obscene amount of disposable income she had this whole day, this was the first time where he could really take in her wealth and the kind of life she was used to. His eyes were wide with awe, and he told himself to savor this, to make this type of success a goal to work towards. He didn't have the level of success to afford a room like this at his point in life, but if he worked hard enough, he would eventually. He would be back to a room like this someday, no question in his mind. 

Not knowing what else to do, he moved to the bar and fixed himself up a drink, and one for Vanessa as well. Hopefully, that would be enough for her, and she would end this crazy game of hers. But she wouldn't try anything anyway. His wife was here with them, and despite her current state, it would be mighty bold to try something in front of her. Hopefully, Vanessa was helping Mandy out of her dress and into something comfortable so she could finally lie down and get some rest for the evening and sleep off the alcohol. It wasn't his ideal plan for his wedding night, but it would have to do. 

Unfortunately for him, it would not be so easy. 

Vanessa had made little progress on helping the drunken woman out of her wedding dress, but she never planned to, to be honest. Mandy might have spent a few paychecks for this dress, but Vanessa struggled with the idea of putting her hands on such a shoddy, cheap, tacky garment. Vanessa didn't give one fuck if Mandy's dress was ruined. She wasn't even particularly interested in helping her out period, to be perfectly frank. 

"Oh, you poor thing," Vanessa whispered, holding up Mandy against the wall. "You poor, brainless little girl." 

"Whhhuuuuhhhh?" Mandy slurred out, barely conscious. Vanessa studied the young redhead's pale skin, finding it as unappealing as her cheap dress. It wasn't nearly as smooth and luscious as her own dark skin. 

"You really fucked up," Vanessa began. "You had one chance to really seal the deal with that hunk out there... if you had just controlled yourself and gave him a night to remember, he would have never left you. Ever. That boy loooovvves you... for some reason." She paused, straightening up the young wife as she almost fell over. "And now, you embarrassed yourself in front of him, and he's wondering if he made a huge mistake. And I think he did. He can do so much better than you. A guy like that deserves the best. He doesn't need a skinny little thing with a flat chest and no ass. He needs a woman with big tits. And an ass that can handle the rough stuff. He doesn't need love, at least the kind of love you offer. No... what that boy needs is some good sex. Hot, sweaty, filthy sex is what locks down a guy like that for good. That boy is gagging for it, and we all smelled it on him. He's getting fucked tonight, the only question is by whom. And you, you poor, stupid little girl, you took yourself out of the running." 

"So," Vanessa paused, easing the young wife, still in her wedding dress, into a seated position against the wall. "You're gonna be stuck in a bathroom while another woman fucks your soul-mate on your wedding night. Your boss, a magnificent, older black bitch, is gonna steal your man from you. And he's gonna love it. He's gonna fuck my tight black cunt... my hot, round ass, my tight, wet mouth... we're gonna do it all together, and you'll be getting none. Those lips that kissed you at the altar? They're gonna be wrapped around my hard nipples, sucking my big tits. And then that tongue of his, the one you no doubt love? It's gonna be rimming my tight ass. Hon... you were so close to having such a perfect life, with all your bad luck turning around... but then you brought that man of yours to me. The second I saw him, I knew I'd have to make him mine. That moment he met me, and stared at my huge black breasts, and yes, that boy was gawking... the moment that happened, he was done with you. From that moment on, he belonged to me." 

Vanessa, the self-proclaimed magnificent black bitch, put her hands on her hips and posed in front of the young wife. 

"And now, I'm gonna make him mine," Vanessa said. "I'm gonna strut out there, shake my hot ass and huge black tits in front of him, and he will crumble. He wants me... badly. He wants my hot ass and huge titties. He wants my hot black body, not your pathetic, skinny little white one. He wants me to dominate him, and I plan to. I've needed a white boy toy for a while now, and that boy... mmm, hmmm. He's too delicious to go to waste," she spat out at the passed-out wife. She gave one last look at the young wife. 

"Bitch, I'm gonna have your husband's babies," the older woman said with finality. Vanessa turned away from her secretary, and moved to make her way out of the bathroom, but not before checking herself out in the mirror one last time, making sure everything was in place and plenty of luscious, bare skin was exposed. 

Zack looked up just in time to see Vanessa step out of the bathroom, shutting and locking the door behind her. Vanessa responded to his confusion before he could ask. 

"It looks like your wife couldn't quite make it to the bed, so we'll let her rest up for a bit in there," she said, smiling as she explained why she left the young wife to sleep alone in a bathroom on her wedding night. 

"Is she okay?" Zack asked as she approached the bar. Grabbing the drink he made for her and sipping it, she replied. 

"Yeah, she'll be fine," she said dismissively, not really caring, her focus solely on the hot young stud across the counter from her. He looked over her shoulder, wanting to check on Mandy. He looked at the stacked black woman in front of him and knew there wasn't much reason for her to still be here, but it appeared as if she was just getting comfortable. 

"I, uh... I think I can take things from here," Zack told her, polishing off his glass, happy for the liquid courage. She studied him for a few moments before smiling in amusement. 

"Well... I did spend my money on you guys for the church, the banquet hall, the caterers, the photographers, the honeymoon, and this room. I think I can at least finish my drink," Vanessa replied. 

"I'd rather you just leave," Zack stated bluntly, standing up to the older woman who had had him on his heels all day. "I'd like to have some privacy with my wife. It's been a long day." 

Vanessa studied him for a moment, her expression far cooler than it had been. She lifted the strong drink to her plump lips and swallowed the remainder of it before setting the glass delicately on the table. She looked down as she did this, and looked up when she was done. 

"We both know that's not how this ends..." she replied, staring him down, no humor in her voice. As she spoke, she leaned over the counter. 

Her massive black breasts pressed softly into the bar. 

Zack's eyes couldn't help but jump down to her chest, to her mammoth, hanging tits, her cleavage looking a mile long as her slim dress struggled to contain her bulbous rack. Her heavy, fleshy breasts were oozing over the edges of her low-cut gown, bursting to escape. There was so much dark, sexy skin exposed to him in this position that it would have been impossible not to notice, but he had enough self-control not to stare too long. He pulled his eyes up to hers and replied. 

"I think you should leave," he said firmly, standing up to her. She simply laughed, her heavy tits jiggling as she stood up straight. 

"Oh, honey, stop acting so innocent," Vanessa tittered. "You want to do some dirty things to my hot body." She sauntered around the bar slowly, approaching him, causing him to step back slightly. "Thinking such filthy thoughts about your wife's hot boss at your own wedding. That's some pretty fucked up shit! I love it!" 1 

===

"Vanessa... this isn't a game. I really don't want any of this. I just want to be with Mandy. So, please... you need to leave now," he insisted, freaking out. Was this really happening? 

"Why?" she replied. "Afraid you can't control yourself around my hot body? I don't blame you. My body is fucking perfect. I know you want to run your hands all over me..." she said boastfully, sliding her hands along her curvy hips. 

"I just..." Zack started. "It's really wrong for you to do this, Vanessa..." 

"Ha!" she laughed as she kept slowly approaching the married man. "There's about to be a whole lot of wrong all up in here." She paused in moved in closer as his back hit the wall. "No need to be so coy, Zack. We've both felt it, from the first moment we met. An attraction. An obsession. A lust. You want to fuck me, and..." she paused, putting a hand on his chest. "I want to fuck you." 

Even through his clothing, her touch felt like an electric jolt. He jumped slightly, and moved around her, desperate to get away. 

"Vanessa, this is a really bad idea..." he told her, backing away. But like an evil, seductive demoness from his nightmares, she just kept coming. And each step caused her luscious black breasts to bounce in a slow, hypnotic jiggle, mesmerizing the married man, despite himself. 

"You can't avoid this, Zack. We both have known from the start that this would end with me and you, and just me and you. Me and you... in that bed... naked, hot and sweaty. Having the kind of rough, filthy nasty sex that you could never have with your wife. You got married to your young, skinny wife, but you've been dreaming of sharing that bed tonight with a real woman... an older woman... a black woman. So why don't we just take off our clothes, jump into the bed, you slide your fat married cock into my tight, dripping black cunt, and we fulfill our destiny," she purred, her velvety voice sounding like creamy caramel, tempting him with a dessert that was too delicious to be good for you. 

"Vanessa..." Zack paused, looking for any way to appeal to her, to get her to stop. "I've been a good guy... a good boyfriend... for years now. I wasn't always a good boyfriend, and it was really fucking hard to break those bad habits. So please... just walk away." 

"Oh honey, you're not telling me anything I don't already know," she replied, her mammoth breasts shaking with every step. "I can take one look at you and see how dirty you really are. I'm sure Mandy's too naïve to see, but it's painted all over you. Sluts like me can practically smell it. You try to act to act all nice and good and present yourself as this normal, upstanding young man, but deep down, you are destined for filth. Guys like you are not put on this planet to be married to normal, boring girls and work a normal, boring job. You're put on this planet to make women like me very happy. Your looks and your bodies may take you places in life, but at the end of the day, you all end up in bed, making slutty women like me scream, fill our hot cunts with cum, and giving us beautiful babies. Guys like you need to live under the thumb of a dominant older woman who tells him what to do, knows what makes him happy, and fucks every inch of his hard cock roughly and lovingly and drains his heavy nuts of all that tasty sperm." 

Zack listened to her insane creed, both horrified, and deeply turned on. His mind was terrified by her blasé declaration of his role in this world, as a tool used to pleasure hot, nasty women. He wanted to scream at her that this wasn't the case, but in his younger years that was his existence, as a throbbing cock used to pleasure the sluttiest of the young women. And there was a certain bliss to a life like that, spending most of your time at the beck and call of a hot-bodied woman, being the sole focus of her nasty, lustful efforts every fucking day. Feeling like you are the only man in the world that can make her scream, squeal, and squirt. So despite the fact that he didn't like what she said, he saw some truth in it. And his cock saw some truth in it as well, loving every bit of her speech as his cock throbbed in his tuxedo pants, as hard as an iron bar. But his mind was still in control of him, at least at the moment, and he still tried to fight back. 

"Vanessa, I'm a married man now. I can't be that type of person anymore. I really, really want to be better than that." Zack begged, trying to resist this seemingly unstoppable force. 

"Oh, honey..." she said, rolling her eyes and smiling, as if he was unbelievably naïve. "Take this from a woman who's been around the block for a while. There's no such thing as a pure, monogamous marriage. In a marriage that lasts, one of the spouses, if not both of them, is getting some on the side. The only way a man can stay with one woman for the rest of his life is he's got a girl on the side who has huge tits and gives him the good stuff whenever he needs it. And, to be honest, dear... if you're struggling this much not to cheat on your first night of marriage... then boy, I don't feel good about your chances of lasting too long before that fat white dick ends up inside of a tight wet cunt that's not your wife's." 

Zack gulped as she deflected his arguments with ease. But he kept trying. 

"She's my wife... my soul-mate... she's so nice and sweet and loving. Not only that, she's your secretary. You paid for this whole wedding, so you clearly care about her. That has to mean something. Plus... she's right in the bathroom! The bathroom of our wedding suite! This would be so, so wrong!" he said, pausing in his movement, laughing at the insanity of the situation. 

"Trust me, that girl drank herself stupid. She is beyond unconscious right now. She ain't waking up for a long, long time. More than enough for us to have some fun," Vanessa said, grabbing his tie like she did earlier, bringing her face to his. "Hon, you will never have a better opportunity to cheat without consequences. You can have the type of sex you need, and there is no chance of your wife ever finding out," she paused, letting him take this in. "There is nothing that can stop this from happening, Zack. Just give in, baby!" she whispered, her hot breath passing across her face, making him shiver. Her bulbous, enormous black breasts pressed into his firm chest. "Let's just do what we've both wanted to do from the moment we met. Let's spend the whole night of your wedding fucking each other's brains out! Why don't you use my hot body to get all of those NASTY urges out of your system? Then you can go on and have your fucking storybook marriage to your skinny little wife." 

Vanessa was selling him a lie, and she knew it. She knew that one fuck with her would make him forget all about his plain, dull, boring bride. She had big plans to make this young white man her permanent boy-toy. She just had to get him into bed first, and then everything else would play out naturally. 

Zack was so torn. On one hand, he so knew better than to get involved in the hot fire that was Vanessa and her luscious, sexy body. Every thought in his brain knew better, but every physical urge in his body was telling him to give in. He had never wanted to fuck any woman more than he wanted to fuck Vanessa at this very moment. She had put him on edge and made him feel stronger feelings of lust than any other woman had, and it wasn't even close. Her hot black body blew all those young sluts he used to bang out of the water. She was so fucking hot, and her luscious, smooth black tits were so fucking big... he had to fight for Mandy. He had to... but it was so hard to resist. 

"Don't you want to fuck me, Zack?" Vanessa teased, bringing her lips to his, giving his reluctant mouth a soft, smooth kiss. The kiss only lasted for a moment, his married lips pressed against the large, plump lips of a woman twenty years his senior. He didn't open his mouth, he held himself back that much, but Vanessa was wearing him down quickly. She pulled back and spoke again, her voice like honey. "Don't you want to see my hot, black body naked?" *Kiss* "Don't you want to slide your fat, white married cock into my tight, 44- year-old black cunt!" She kissed him softly again, before sliding one hand down until it slid over his clothed bulge. Her knowledgeable fingers ran up its length, massaging it, feeling its full size. "Oh my... you are big!" she whispered, kissing him again. "It's huge... so fucking huge!!" *kiss* "I love it already." *kiss* "And it loves me." *kiss* "Do you want my body, Zack?" *kiss* "My naked body." *kiss* "Do you want my tits?" She slid the hand that was on his cock over to his wrist. Grabbing it and lightly pulling it, she easily guided his hand upward. Zack was panting, overwhelmed. She pulled his hand up to her chest, pressing his palm against her huge left breast, before gripping the back of his hand in hers and squeezing it down. 

Zack was now squeezing Vanessa's huge breast. And it was amazing! 

His fingertips were pressed against bare flesh, and his palm was placed over the thin, golden material as his hand was forced to clutch the massive, soft, succulent breast. It was unbelievably soft and perky, and even clothed it felt incredible between his fingers. 

"Uhhh!" he grunted, unable to resist vocalizing his awe at the feeling of her huge breast in his hand. It was at this moment that his wife was forgotten, pushed to the back of his mind. It was at this moment that his body's urges overtook his brain's reluctance. His lizard brain had risen to the surface, at least for the moment. And at the moment he vocalized his pleasure at the feeling of her huge breast in his hand, his lips parted. His body waved the white flag of surrender. His defenses had crumbled. His fight had worn down, and he was ready to give in. 

Zack and Vanessa were about to fuck. 

Before he could change his mind, Vanessa used her grip on his tie to pull him down into her, bringing her open lips to his roughly, sliding her thick tongue deep into his married mouth. Their lips mashed together as Vanessa kissed the new husband fiercely, their tongues mashing together in his mouth. Zack resisted for only a moment before letting the pleasure of the nasty kiss overwhelm him. He let her pull him down and hold him in place as Zack made out with his wife's 44-year-old black boss, while his wife was passed out in the bathroom mere feet away. It was so wrong, but nothing could be hotter to him at the moment. Vanessa was bringing the old Zack to the surface, and she was confident that by the end of the night, that Zack would be here to stay. 

The older woman and the married man swapped spit as their tongues dueled, sliding in and out of each others' mouths, both of them fully committed to the illicit kiss. Vanessa was still in control of her surroundings, guiding Zack towards the bed as they made out, their hot needy mouths smacking together in this nasty, sloppy kiss. As Zack's legs hit the bed, he finally pushed her back, his conscience flaring up one last time. 

"Wait, wait, wait..." he panted out, catching his breath as he put a few feet between them. "Vanessa, we can't... this is so wrong!" he declared, shaking his head. 

"Well, does this change your mind?" Vanessa asked. Before he could react, Vanessa deftly slid the straps of dress down off her shoulders. The only thing holding up the dress was the incredible outward force exerted by her mammoth, firm black tits. Before Zack could try to stop her, Vanessa brought her fingers to the top hem of her low-cut dress and yanked down, pulling it with enough force to overcome the pressure exerted on the dress by her huge boobs, until finally, Vanessa's rack was released from their tight constraints. 

Vanessa's enormous black breasts were now fully exposed to the married man. 

Zack was absolutely dumbstruck. His jaw literally dropped. They were amazing! They jutted out from her chest like overly-ripe fruit, perfectly smooth, firm, and round. They were perfectly enormous, and looking upon them, all you saw was the type of immaculate softness that made you want to squeeze them firmly to your heart's content. Her breast-flesh looked silky smooth, but it was her dark black skin that really set her apart. In a way that he couldn't fully explain, her black flesh added a depth of pure lust and sexiness that, added due their massive size, made them easily the best, most perfect pair of breasts that he had ever laid eyes on. And it wasn't even that close. Vanessa's huge, naked black breasts were the most attractive pair of big tits he could ever imagine seeing, and Zack, the newly married man, couldn't pull his eyes away. His gaze was soon locked on her hard, throbbing nipples as they hardened into chewy, rubbery caps. The dark nipples were more than a mouthful, and it seemed as if they were calling for his mouth, aching for his married lips to wrap around them and worship her huge breasts in the way they deserved. 

Any fight in the married man's heart was torn apart by those colossal black udders. His drunk, passed-out wife was forgotten. The fact that this was his wedding night slipped his mind. The fact that this woman was his wife's much older boss didn't matter. The fact that she was black... that only made it better. The old Zack was rising to the surface, and this freshly reborn stud wanted to worship those huge fucking tits in every way imaginable. 

Vanessa saw how enraptured the married man was and looked to press her advantage. 

"Do you like my tits, Zack?" Vanessa asked, lowering her dress further, exposing her fit, sexy belly, and all that luscious, bare black skin to his eyes, but his eyes never left her big, bare breasts. 

"Yes..." Zack admitted with almost zero hesitance, his voice monotone as his mind was seemingly shut down by the sight of the older black woman's perfect, juicy tits. 

"Do you love my tits?" Vanessa purred, sliding her dress past her belly button, exposing the tiny strings of her golden thong straps riding high over her hips. 

"Yes..." Zack repeated in the same monotone voice, as if he had been worn down to the point where he couldn't conceal his true feelings anymore. He was being completely honest to the older black woman when he said he loved her enormous boobs. 

"Do you love them more than your wife's breasts?" she asked, wiggling her hips, trying to work her dress down, more and more of her thong underwear being revealed to the married man. 

"Yes..." Zack said, licking his lips, his wife's breasts barely a blip on his radar. Vanessa's massive breasts stood out in his mind as much as they stood out from her chest, and he had no choice but to express his admiration. 

"Do you love them more than you love your wife?" she asked, and it was only then that his eyes were pulled up from her tits, meeting her knowing glare, resisting giving in fully to her. At the same moment, she pulled her dress down over her hips, letting the shimmering garment cascade to the floor, revealing her magnificent long legs. She now stood proudly in front of Zack, showing off her nearly naked body. The only thing she had on was the tiny thong, barely covering her mature black cunt, leaving little to the imagination. Zack was afraid of the answer to her question, and the words caught in his throat. Seeing his struggle, Vanessa slid her hands up her body, until she ended up cupping her gigantic knockers in her hands, the flesh of her big jugs pouring through her fingers as she squeezed them lightly. 

"Do you want to suck my big tits, Zack?" the older black woman cooed. 

"Yes..." he replied, finding his voice, unable to hide his desperation to possess her hot body. 

"Then tell me you love them more than you love your wife?" she commanded, her tone stern but amused. Part of Zack wanted to fight for his wife, but at this point, he was too far gone, lost in the haze of pure lust caused by her luscious black body. Zack had spent years hardening up his outer shell, armoring himself against this kind of sexual temptation, but this older black woman had blown his defenses apart. He couldn't resist giving her what she wanted. Her mammoth breasts were too huge, too firm and soft looking, too positively suckable to deny. 

"I love your big perfect tits more than I love my wife," the new husband croaked out, unable to stop himself. He didn't even know if it was true at all, but the fact that he was actually debating the question should be answer enough. Zack was truly more in love with Vanessa's enormous breasts than he was in love with his wife. He had admitted the truth, that the years spent with his new bride and the love they shared meant less to him than the contents of her boss's bra. 

"That's it, honey," she cooed, happy upon his admission, squeezing her breasts as she pointed them at him. "Well, c'mon baby, what are you waiting for... suck my big black tits, Zack!" 

Zack tried his best not to appear too eager, but it was desperation that drove him to practically leap forward, diving face first into the older woman's breasts. As she held her tits out to him, he moved in close and pressed his face directly into them firmly. They were so incredibly soft! He scrubbed his face against the warm, soft flesh as she rearranged herself, sliding one arm under her rack to hold them up as she reached behind his head with her other hand to press his face into her firmly, seeking to drown this undersexed white boy in her massive bust. A low, animalistic growl emerged from his throat as he savored her amazing breasts with his face, wanting to feel her soft udders against every square inch of his chiseled face. As he rested his head against her massive black tits, he felt a blissful feeling of peace that he hadn't felt in years. 

Zack wanted to get his hands on her huge, bare tits, badly. But after going years without feeling a pair of big tits in his palms, he wanted to savor the moment. Zack slid his hands against her sides, slowly sliding his hands upward along her smooth, hot flesh. As his manly white hands slid against her supple black skin, he shivered in anticipation. And, just as Vanessa moved her arm to allow the young white man access, Zack's hands glided up and took her huge tits in his big hands. And finally, after hours of staring at them, Zack finally gave his wife's boss's enormous breasts a nice, firm squeeze. 

"Holy fuck!" Zack moaned out, pulling his face away from her big tits long enough to express his awe. They were so soft! Zack squeezed them between his fingers again and again, unable to get enough. The soft, succulent flesh oozed between his fingers in just the right way. This was a sensation he hadn't experienced in years, the indescribable feel of a pair of big breasts in your hands, and it made him wonder how the hell he had gone so long without doing this. His big hands were overfilled with big, firm tits. And the added layer of filth at seeing his white hands squeezing these luscious, juicy black breasts almost made him crazed with lust. As his fingers slid down and flicked against her throbbing nipples, he finally lost control. "Oh my God!" he moaned out softly, before attacking her left nipple with his married mouth. 

"Fuck yeah!" Vanessa moaned out, her eyes closing as her head tipped back, enjoying the blissful sensation of this hot white man's married mouth tugging on her nipple. His tongue was flicking at the hardened nub as his open mouth inhaled the massive teat. He sucked at the throbbing nipple, tugging at it, biting it lightly, coating it with his hot saliva, his mouth working the hard nub as if trying to draw milk from the massive udder. "Oh, honey... you suck my big tits so well!" 

Vanessa dug her nails into his scalp, holding him in place as he sucked her tasty nipple. He was working over her breasts so well, squeezing them both rhythmically as he sucked. She guided him between nipples, letting him work the other nipple over, giving it the same worship he gave the first one. 2

"Baby... I've been dreaming of getting that mouth on my tits all fucking day!" she moaned out, scratching his neck lovingly. "Mmm, yeah. Suck Mama's tits, baby!" Zack's eyes were closed, his entire focus on pleasuring Vanessa's massive black breasts with his married mouth. He switched between spit-soaked nipples at the perfect moments, giving both equal attention. Vanessa marveled at his efforts. "You are SO good at sucking my big tits, honey! I don't know how you could get by sucking Mandy's itty bitty titties." Zack didn't acknowledge the slight against his wife. He was too far gone, so immersed was he in her massive rack. Noting this, she again pressed her advantage. "You got married to that little bitch, but it's my big boobs you've got your hands on. It's my big knockers you're sucking. Not hers. That dumb bitch is passed out in her fucking wedding dress, and you're too busy sucking her boss's big, black breasts to care..." Vanessa said, savoring each syllable. Zack only attacked her tits with more vigor, chewing on her rubbery nipples as he squeezed harder. 

Unable to contain her own urges any longer, she let her hands get to work. She deftly undid his tie and tossed it away. She roughly yanked his shirt from his pants and ripped the buttons apart before pulling it off his shoulders. She yanked off his undershirt, only losing the sensation of his mouth on her nipple for a split second before he was back at it, sucking once more. Looking down at his fit, hard chest, she couldn't stop her hands from exploring, her slim, black fingers sliding against his hard muscles. She kept feeling him up for a few moments before she attacked his belt with her hands, eager to get his pants down. She pulled his belt apart, roughly yanked open the button and zipper, and tugged his pants down, revealing his tight, navy blue boxer briefs, which clung to his throbbing manhood. Unable to stop herself, she pressed her hand against his throbbing dick, feeling its length through his briefs. 

"Mmmph!" Zack moaned, his voice muffled by the immenseness of the huge breast pressed against his face. He winced in pleasure as he sucked and squeezed her big boobs a little harder. Vanessa appraised his big white dick with her fingers, stroking it the best she could in this position, but this didn't suffice. She wanted to get a closer look, and she wanted to get her hands on his bare white dick. Reluctantly, she pushed back at the younger man, digging her hands into his bare chest lightly, pushing the dazed white man back. Whereas before, this was the point he fought back, this time, he fell into a seated position at the foot of the bed, his pants around his knees, still clad in his underwear. 

As Vanessa stepped out of the dress that was now pooled at her feet, she let her eyes admire the half-nude white man sitting in front of her. Her eyes blazed with lust as she admired his fit body, happy with what she saw. He didn't have pretty, show muscles that you find on some muscle head gym rat. No, this boy had real muscle, the type that wasn't flashy. His muscles were capable of anything, lifting heavy furniture, doing hard work in the garage, or sweeping a woman off her feet, into his firm manly arms. His white skin had a good complexion, smooth and only slightly tanned, as years of work outdoors gave him a decent base, which had faded only slightly from years living in the big city. The white boy looked good, more than exceeding her high expectations. 

Smiling wickedly at him, she stepped forward and kneeled down between his legs, her saliva-coated tits swaying as she moved. Zack looked down at her, silent, panting heavily, at this point too committed to what was happening to object. This was gonna happen, and there was nothing that could stop his inevitable slide into adultery. He only hoped he could go back to Mandy after this. 

Vanessa slid her eyes lazily from the married man's eyes to his bulging crotch. She brought her hands up to the hem of his briefs and paused, savoring the moment. Looking up at him with her heated gaze one last time, she looked down just in time as she lifted the hem of his briefs, and with a firm tug she pulled his briefs down to his knees, until finally, after hours of waiting, his throbbing white dick was exposed to her greedy stare. 

"Oh my goodness!" she gasped, her confident façade dropping for just a moment, her awe completely genuine. Mere inches from her face, dangling in the air, was maybe the most perfect white cock she had ever laid eyes on. It was simply beautiful. Firstly, it was just a fat fucking dick. A good nine inches in length, and thick enough that you couldn't wrap your fingers completely around it. The tip was nice and fat and perfectly shaped. His balls were nice and big, the two sperm-swollen nuts looking smooth as they bulged out against the thin skin of scrotum. The stretched skin surrounding his massive white dick was smooth and even in complexion, showing that the wear and tear and signs of experience this dick no doubt once had were now barely visible. Now, after years of boring monogamy, his dick was looking pristine, looking like the perfect white dick black women like her dreamed about. A cock like this would be wasted in marriage, at least to a little young thing like Mandy. No, this dick needed to be tamed and subjugated to the whims and needs of a beautiful, powerful black woman who knew how to put that cock in its place. Use that pristine, perfect cock for its intended purpose, namely lots and lots of filthy sex. And if a woman could truly tame that cock and turn this independent, strong-willed white man into a compliant, willing boy-toy, than she could harvest this fat, married cock into a tool designed to give said powerful woman thousands upon thousands of world shaking orgasms. It was her duty to use her many skills to make sure this perfect white cock was being used to its full potential. 

"Oh my God!" she marveled, sliding her fingers around the throbbing shaft, causing the overstimulated young man to jump with shock, feeling a woman touching him that wasn't Mandy for the first time in a long time. She could feel his dick pulsing, ready to explode. Handling it gently, like a loaded weapon, she moved his massive penis around so she could admire every inch of it with her greedy eyes. Chewing on her lower lip, she let her eyes follow the thick tube running along the underside, all the way up to the meaty tip, where the hole on the tip was leaking his precious juices. She moved her face closer so she could feel it's heat, running her nose along its length so she could let his manly pheromones hit her full on. Her mouth was watering and the size of the throbbing weapon in her hands was making her lose control, making her feel like an inexperienced teenager face-to-face with her first real, man-sized cock. After years of going without regular bouts of white dick, it took every fiber in her being to stop her from taking this magnificent meaty cock into her hungry mouth. This moment passed quickly, and before Zack could sense any difference, she regained her confident demeanor. Looking up at him, her lips turned up wickedly as she began to slowly stroke him. 

"Uhhh... fuck!" Zack groaned out, his head rolling slightly. 

"You like that, hon?" Vanessa said, her boobs swaying as her hand slowly increased its pace on his throbbing member. Zack looked down, seeing the slim, black fingers of his wife's sexy boss jacking him off. The sensation, as well as the color contrast, drove him wild. His cock pulsed in her hand. She let her fingers tease near the tip, driving him wild, but knowing exactly how to hold him off from exploding in her hand. 

"Yes... FUCK!" Zack groaned out, the pleasure exquisite. 

"Here's what's gonna happen, baby," Vanessa began, her slim black fingers stroking the married cock, his pre-cum providing the lube. "I'm gonna stroke this beautiful fucking cock until you can't see straight," she said, rotating her hand as she stroked him, adding to his pleasure. "Then I'm gonna suck this fat fucking white dick until you're right on the fucking edge, until you're fucking balls are filled to the fucking brim with that thick married cum..." she teased, squeezing his cock rhythmically as she stroked him. "And then I'm gonna ride that fat married cock till it makes me scream, and only when I give you permission, will you fucking drain your nuts in my tight black cunt!" 

"Fuck!" Zack said, the lewdness of her statements driving him wild with a forbidden lust he hadn't tapped into in years. She pointed his cock upward and let her hot saliva drip from her mouth onto the tip, adding to the moisture lubing his married cock. As her magic touch forced the married man into a prone position on his back, the pleasure almost too much to handle, she deftly pulled off the rest of his clothes, leaving him completely naked in front of her. As she moved her face in close, she gave him firm, focused strokes, her hand traversing from the tip to his swollen sack, his cock soaked with her spit and his juices, she felt his cock swell up. 

"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! Vanessa! FUCK!" Zack called out, his body tensed, his ass rising from the bed as he pumped up into her stroking hand. And just as he was about to explode, Vanessa pulled her soaked hand away, letting his cock simmer, the orgasm pulled away from him at the last moment. He reached down to touch himself, but she was there to play defense, slapping his hands away, not wanting him to have the pleasure he needed just yet. She wanted to turn this smart, intelligent white man into a lust crazed beast, drive him so insane with lust and need that he would do whatever she told him just to get the pleasure he so badly needed. For a few moments, she let his load boil, until finally, she took his cock into her hand again, simply holding it. He sat up again, his eyes blazing with need. 

"Vanessa..." he began, looking down at her smug face. "You fucking bitch!" These harsh words only made her smile. 

"Baby, you need to learn that you don't get to cum without my permission. That became true the second we met." Vanessa told him. "You put a ring on Mandy's finger, but this fat white cock belongs to me now. I decide who it fucks. I decide who fucks it. I've already decided that it's not gonna end up inside your wife on your wedding night. And after we fuck tonight, that wife of yours isn't gonna touch this cock again!" 

"You can't do that..." Zack said, eyes blazing with anger as the older black woman held his cock firmly. "She's my wife... this is just a one-time thing," he proclaimed, still clinging to that hope. 

"Aww, it's cute that you think you can go back to her..." she said, stroking him lightly. "But that one's not even up to me. Once you and I fuck, you won't want to go back to her. You'll forget all about her. You'll live only for me, and my hot black body. You'll fucking worship me, like the hot-bodied black goddess I am. You'll do what I say, just so you can get the type of pleasure you know you can only get from me." She looked at him, brimming with a calm, heated confidence as she boldly proclaimed his future. His eyes stared down at her, his resolve like steel. 

"I'm gonna fuck your fucking brains out," Zack claimed boldly, his tone changing, the heat in his voice making him sound like a new man. "You're gonna regret making me do this. I've held this back for years. You've unleased something that can't be held back. I'm gonna take years of lust out on your fucking body. You won't be the same after this." Zack promised, shaking his head, angry at the feelings she had unleashed in him. 

"I'll be just fine," Vanessa replied calmly, not worried in the least. She held his cock at the base and pointed it upward, ready to take this to the next step. She locked eyes on the fat tip of his huge white cock, unable to resist the visual pleasure of just staring at this beautiful sight. Her mouth watered and she licked her lips as she stared at the throbbing white dick. It had been too long since she had done this and she couldn't wait another moment. "We'll see how tough you are after I do this..." And, before he could do anything, Vanessa's plump, sexy lips parted and she descended, holding his eyes with hers. Her hot breath hit the swollen tip just before it disappeared into the warm recesses of her mature mouth. Her tongue slid against the underside as she lowered her open mouth over his large member, and once the tip hit the back of her throat, she closed her plump, smooth lips around the circumference of his aching, married shaft and formed a tight seal. 

"Fuck!" Zack sighed. He watched the older black woman hollow her cheeks around his throbbing cock and begin sucking. 

For Vanessa, this was the culmination of a twenty year hunger for hard white dick. For years, she had denied the deep, unyielding need she felt, telling herself how wrong those feelings were, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Like the fact that the many affairs she had had with white men in college were easily the best, hottest and most lusty encounters she had ever had. There was just something about hard, throbbing white dick made her squirt and squeal in a way that black dick never had. Or the fact that white cock just tasted better on her tongue. Or that she had spent years fantasizing about having white babies. Or the thoughts that would rise to her mind whenever she would saunter by the hunky white, eager-to-please, young interns at her company, thoughts she told herself she shouldn't be having, thoughts that made her feel like such a dirty, filthy slut. This hunger had finally boiled over, and now that she felt no shame in indulging her deepest desires, she was ready to go crazy. 

So, when Zack's smooth, throbbing cock slid along her tongue, allowing her to taste a white dick for the first time in two decades, it sent a jolt through her brain, sending a shock of pleasure coursing through her body. This wasn't wrong. This was the furthest thing from wrong. This was so, so right! This was where she belonged. Vanessa Jones wasn't meant for black men. No, Vanessa, and her luscious black body, was built for studly white men. Her mouth was meant to be full of white penis. Her tight black cunt was built to be stuffed with white cock. Her tight ass was meant to be split open by huge white dick. Any hesitance she once felt was now gone. 

Vanessa was ready to fuck some white dick. 

As soon as the indescribable flavor of white dick hit her tongue, Vanessa lost control. She attacked that white dick with her mouth, attacking with clear hunger and ferocious passion. There was no hesitance as she inhaled the white cock, going deeper and deeper, her lips wrapped around the shaft, her tongue worshipping the delectable meat. Soon, her smooth plump lips were stretched around the root of his pulsing meat. She looked up at him, eyes blazing in lust, cheeks hollowed around his big white cock, her heated saliva coating his throbbing shaft. She bobbed up and down, sucking his fat white cock hard, going up and down, taking his dick deep into her tight throat. Despite Zack's dislike of Vanessa, he couldn't describe how incredible this blowjob felt. She was savoring it as only a woman who truly loved sucking cock could, sucking on his throbbing member hard, her tongue going crazy, marinating each square inch of cock with saliva, while applying perfect tongue worship to his aching shaft, driving him to the edge once more. 

"Holy shit!" Zack moaned out, unable to contain the pleasure he was feeling. It had been a long time since he had his cock sucked with such fervor and talent. Mandy had a very sensitive gag reflex, so with a cock the size of his, she could only really manage a knob-polish, and due to this, she wasn't really particularly good at the act. Only the whorish young women he used to screw could really attack his dick with such cock-sucking fervor, but even then, they couldn't take his cock to the base in the way Vanessa could. They could only take a sizable portion. None of them could stuff his fat cock down their throat like Vanessa did. He didn't know how she could breathe as she worshipped his cock, smoothly inhaling his cock down her mature throat. She would open her mouth and swallow his cock, sealing her thick lips around the root of his cock before rising again, the pulsing white shaft emerging smoothly from her heated ebony mouth. 

Her broiling saliva was coating his white cock pooling in his crotch and coating his swollen nuts. She brought her slim hand up to his scrotum and gently massaged his large nuts, the smooth, white testes being mashed lightly by her slim black mature fingers. 

She was unrelenting as she hungrily attacked his throbbing prick. The only sound heard was the soft, squishing suction of her mature mouth around his cock. 

"Oh, you are so much fucking better at this than Mandy." Zack moaned out before he could stop himself, causing the older black woman to attack his cock with even more passion. He knew this would be the outcome to his compliments. The girls he used to fuck LOVED hearing how much better they were than other girls, specifically their rivals, or the girls Zack was dating at the time. And Vanessa was no different, loving hearing that she was superior to her younger white counterpart. As Zack felt her curls brush his thighs, he lifted one hand and rested it on top of her head. As he did this, he looked up to realize that there was a mirror across from them, reflecting the illicit acts being performed on the bed. 

Zack was sitting on the bed, legs spread, his naked body exposed. Crouched between his legs was a voluptuous, older black woman, her head bobbing energetically in his lap, her full black hair shaking. From behind, he could see the full expanse of her bare sexy back, and from her seated position, her full, round, juicy black ass was jutting out, shown off immaculately. Zack studied the tiny gold thong, forming the sexy triangle on her lower back before the tiny thong string heroically delving deep between her full, round ass cheeks, before widening over her pussy, just barely keeping her treasure covered. Also, from her position, he couldn't help but marvel at the fact that her massive black jugs were so fucking big that they could be seen from behind, the sides of her big tits ballooning outward lusciously, the massive, hanging udders brushing his thighs as she sucked him off. This was the image being reflected back at him, an image of the pure, illicit passion of interracial sex, of an older black woman worshipping the cock of a well-hung, studly, younger white man. No matter how things turned out, this was an image he would never, ever forget. An image that insured that he would always associate gorgeous older black women with indescribable pleasure. 

Vanessa's hungry mouth focused entirely on his cock-head, her smooth lips smothered the tip as her tongue tickled the underside. Her cheeks hollowed inhumanely as she sucked on his mushroom tip hard, gnawing on his cock like a complete slut. She pulled her mouth from his cock with a loud pop before attacking the shaft from the side, sliding her open mouth up and down the sides while rotating her mouth around its circumference, slobbering all over it as she stroked him lightly. She slid her mouth down to his nuts, sucking on each of the smooth balls, one at a time, worshipping each one with her tongue, coaxing even more thick cream into his swollen testicles, increasing his singular need for that one bone-shaking orgasm. 

After worshipping his balls for a few minutes and tickling his nuts with her sinewy tongue, she slid her mouth back up to the tip and wrapped her plump lips around his cock once more. His balls boiling even further, he placed both hands onto her head and began to slowly pump his cock upward, fucking the black woman's mouth with his fat white cock. His cock began to swell up and as his veins began pumping electric bolts of pleasure throughout his body, he started fucking the older black woman's throat more savagely, smoothly making her take his entire length in her hot mouth. His wet nuts smacked against her chin as he made her take his length, but she wasn't complaining, savagely attacking his dick as roughly as he fucked up into her. 3 

===

"Fuck!" Zack grunted, his balls beginning to boil as he fucked into her, feeling his long awaited orgasm just within reach. "I love fucking your tight throat!" he growled, the beast inside him rising to the surface for just a moment. As he began to lose control, Vanessa reached up and gripped his wrists, digging her nails into his tensed muscles, forcing him to release his grip on her scalp. So tensed with pleasure, he allowed her to guide him as she used her nails against his tensed belly, pushing him onto his back on the bed. She leaned up and moved above him as she attacked his cock fully, stroking his swollen, spit-soaked cock as she sucked it aggressively, her saliva pooling around his crotch. Zack looked down and met the older black woman's aggressive glare. 

Vanessa wasn't sucking him with such fervor merely to suck him into compliance and submission, even though that was a happy outcome to her work. No, she was sucking with such fervor because she loved it. She loved sucking dick, and having a white cock in her mouth, satiating her hunger after so many years. She couldn't stop herself. She was ravenous, inhaling his cock hungrily. White dick was so fucking good! The flavor was so incredible to her advanced palate, she had already decided she would never let another cock into her mouth that wasn't white. It tasted too good and too perfect to deny herself this meal any longer. White cock was too amazing not to suck on. 

She could sense Zack being on edge once more as she could feel his cock swell and spasm in her mouth. His nuts were swollen, desperate to empty into her hot, tight mouth. She kept sucking him aggressively, repeatedly and rhythmically swallowing his cock to the root, before sealing her full lips and sucking hard as she ascended back upward, repeating the process over and over again, driving him insane with lust. She stroked him lightly as well, and those things, combined with the mind-melting sight of her massive black breasts hanging below her, brushing his cock slightly, was enough to send him on his way to cumming hard. 

"Oh fuck... oh fuck... OH FUCK!" Zack grunted out. He was getting closer and closer to cumming, and then finally, when he finally was about to turn the point of no return... 

"Ahh!" Vanessa exhaled, lifting her mouth from his cock at the vital moment, taking him right to the edge but holding him there, not letting him over. Bands of thick drool mixed with his pre-cum connected her panting mouth to his cock- head. The tip throbbed and moved slightly, searching for her mouth, searching for something to take him over the edge into bliss. He didn't care if that meant shooting his thick married seed into his wife's boss's mouth. He needed to cum badly, and he was desperate to have this black woman get the job done. His cock was like concrete in her hand as she gripped it tightly, trying to hold off any cum from pumping up his lengthy shaft. It throbbed in her palm as it ached for one more bit of pleasure, but she was not feeling merciful. 

"White boy doesn't get to cum unless Mama lets you," she spat out at the married man. As his cock settled down, she began to lightly tease his meat with her fingers, knowing it wouldn't make him lose it. Stroking him ever so gently, keeping him on edge, she continued talking. "Look at you... all that trash talk, all that bravado... now you're begging for Mama's touch. You tell me you don't want this, yet you're begging to cum in my mouth. You want to cum, baby? You want Mama to make you cum?" 

"Please!" Zack pleaded, being driven insane, squirming to her touch. 

"But... this cum belongs to your little wife. You just married her. It would be cheating if you came in the evil black lady's sexy mouth?" Vanessa teased, stroking him slowly. 

"I don't fucking care!" Zack called out. "Please!" 

"You've been saving this load for months just to give your wife the privilege of first dibs on your creamy jizz. So after all that work, you want to give your prized load of cum to another woman instead? Your wife's boss? An older black woman?" Vanessa teased. 

"Fuck you!" Zack cried out, laughing maniacally, driven to the point of near insanity by her teasing hand. She kept teasing him, stroking him gently while cradling his sperm-heavy balls in her palm. 

"You love it," she told him. "You love everything about me. My gorgeous face. My hot black body. The fact that I'm much older than you. The way I dominated your wedding, consumed your sole attention, and demolished your brainless wife. You act so big and strong, but you love being controlled by a strong woman. A mature woman. A dominant woman. A black woman. You don't have the discipline to control this cock, regulate the rate that cum leaves your nuts, so you've lost the privilege. This cock needs to be controlled by a powerful, controlling, evil fucking bitch, not some idiotic little stick-figure young wife, who can never give you what you really fucking need. Face it Zack, you fucking love me." 

"It's not true," Zack croaked out, trying to deny the truth surrounding his deep attraction towards this older black woman. 

"Don't deny it baby," she cooed, still stroking him lightly. "You took one look at me and fell madly in love. Haha! You scoped out my big black tits and fell head over heels in love with another woman at your own wedding. Haha!" she teased. 

"No..." he said, denying her hot sounding trash talk, even though his cock pulsed in her hand in response, giving her the answer she wanted. 

"And it's time to make it official, baby," Vanessa purred, sliding her hand off his spit-soaked cock with a flourish. She stood straight up, her big jugs jiggling as she rose. Zack lied back, frozen, waiting to see her next move. She hooked her fingers in her thong straps and yanked downward, pulling the tiny garment past her big hips and letting them fall to the floor. She stood back up, revealing her now completely nude form to the younger white man. He could now see her now completely shaven, mature pussy, the two plump lips soaked with her juices. Before Zack could do anything, she began crawling onto the bed, crawling over his naked body. "It's time for us to become lovers, hon," she said to him, her massive, dark, bouncing tits completely holding his attention. They were so huge they slid against his chest as she moved over him, before she settled above him, her heavy black breasts resting on his face, her hard nipples scraping against his cheeks. She reached back behind her and took his cock between her nimble fingers again, giving him a few quick teasing strokes before pointing his hard pillar upward, slapping the throbbing head against her ready pussy. She looked down at him, smiling smugly. "This ain't gonna be a one-time thing, baby. You're about to go black, and trust me, a fine young white man like you will never go back. You are mine, now." 

Before he could object, she moved backward, pushing back against that big white cock, forcing the head to spread her lips apart, until his throbbing, unyielding cock-head breached her tight cunt. 

"Oh my God!" Zack called out, the immediate tightness of this mature pussy overwhelming him. 

"Oh fuck!" Vanessa swore loudly as she felt the tip of a white cock inside her tight cunt for the first time in decades. "Holy shit!" she moaned as her pussy took a few inches of his thick, pulsing manhood. "AH! Fuck yes!" she squealed, her cunt quivering over its much wanted white intruder. Vanessa came for the first time, with only a quarter of his white dong inside of her. She slapped the bed a few times as she orgasmed, her body pressed against him as she paused in place, holding onto the first few inches of that juicy white dick. Her cunt spasmed, and her juices dripped down along his shaft. As she rode out her hard orgasm, the white dick lodged inside her was stirring up her juices like crazy, the divine liquid dripping down his already lubed up cock. 

She finally regained her bearings and now was primed for more. She leaned back up, her massive black breasts hanging over his chest. She screwed up her face and leaned back, forcing more white dick up her juicy, primed, ready-for-action pussy. 

"Oh God!" Zack moaned. 

"Shit yes!" Vanessa called out, feeling that perfect white dick stretch out her needy hole. She drove back, taking over half of that young, throbbing white cock inside of her. "Oh my God! Fuck yes! That's some good dick! That's some good fucking dick! OH GOD!" she squealed, another orgasm wracking her body again. This was another small orgasm, but it ripped through the luscious mature black woman. No dick had ever affected her like this. It usually took even her best lovers a good amount of time to make her squeal, and yet this slab of white meat was just driving her crazy. She wasn't normally this sensitive, but here she was, cumming like a complete whore on this fat white cock, and it was only halfway inside her! How could this dick be so fucking good? Her cunt was so starved for white cock that it was dripping like crazy now that it had one inside her. Did her pussy really love white dick that much? Was white dick that much better? Was this what she was missing out on all these years? Regaining her bearings once again, she looked down at the white man beneath her, eyes blazing with heat. 

"I'm gonna wear this fucking dick out!" she screamed out. "I haven't cum like this in years! I'm not letting you stop until I am totally satisfied. Yes!" she moaned, forcing more white cock inside of her. 

"Jesus..." Zack moaned, his head falling back. He was in pure bliss as well. As much as he loved Mandy, her pussy did not feel this good. Vanessa's tight black cunt was squeezing every inch of cock it could, smothering his shaft with bone- melting pleasure. How could a 44-year-old woman's cunt feel this much better than a woman's pussy half her age? It was just so fucking tight! He closed his eyes tight the pleasure was so great. More and more of his cock was being swallowed up by her amazing pussy, making him grunt and groan. Even the slutty girls he used to fuck didn't ever feel this good. This cunt was trained. It knew how to handle dick. It had the experience needed to swallow a great, big cock and give pleasure to every inch of it. This was a mature cunt, and it was blowing his fucking mind. "Holy shit, Vanessa!" 

"You like that? You like that black pussy, baby?" Vanessa asked the squirming married man, her cunt taking three quarters of his massive dick. Small orgasms were rippling through her, one after the next, but she was steeling herself against them. She had to maintain control, show this white boy who was boss. She put her hands on his chest, dug her long nails into him, and reared down, flexing her ass, driving herself down fully, her juicy ass slamming into his thighs. "UUUGGGGHHHHHHH!" she grunted from deep in her throat. 

"Jesus Christ!" Zack called out as the mature woman took his entire length into her small, tight cunt. The pleasure he was feeling could barely be put into words. Feeling the older black woman's tight, slutty cunt squeezing every fucking inch of his thick white weapon, massaging its entire length, making it pulse with pleasure... it was simply incredible. It made him realize what he was missing out on dating a good, sweet girl like Mandy. Good girls don't have cunts this amazing. You need a real, tight, whorish cunt to really get this kind of true pleasure. A nice girl's pussy doesn't squeeze the life out of your cock like this, trying to milk every drop of cum into her tight hole. Only that nasty cunt does that. It was only the bad girl's cunts that could make cock feel this good. Zack knew this from experience, and with how good Vanessa's pussy felt... she might just be the baddest bitch of them all. 

Vanessa swiveled her hips, swirling his rod inside of her, her tight walls gripping that white cock hard, not wanting to let go. Her hungry cunt was being fed its favorite meal, and it never wanted to stop tasting it. She rhythmically squeezed his fat cock with her firm black cunt, getting used to his size while coating that fat white meat with her copious, flowing juices, prepping it for the rough, nasty fucking that was about to ensue. 

Zack had obviously resigned himself to sex with the older black woman. It would be bad if he hadn't, since he was currently balls deep inside of her. But he was trying not to enjoy it too much, since he still wanted to go back to his wife after this. If he got too into this, if the pleasure became so great, he would slip back into his old ways. He had worked hard to tamp that side of him down, and if it got unleashed again, he didn't know if he had it in him to push it back down again. He didn't know if he could be satisfied with his wife sexually if this fuck session was really, really good. He could only hope the pace stayed like this, and didn't become the lusty, vigorous encounter he feared. 

"Your cock feels so good, baby," she purred, eyes closed, chewing lightly on her plump bottom lip. His body was tensed as her magic cunt teased his cock, doing enough to keep him on edge while not doing enough to take him over. "Mama needed this! Mama needed that fat fucking white cock! The way it was bulging in your pants during the wedding... it was fucking calling out to me. Calling out for that black pussy, baby! I couldn't take my eyes off of it, and now it's mine. That fucking big married white cock is all mine, baby!" she called out, her cunt quivering lightly around him as a bolt of pleasure ripped through her. She flexed her round, juicy, black ass as she squeezed his cock hard with her wet pussy, riding out her small orgasm, making the young man hold is breath as he tried to withstand the pleasure. Finally, her grip on him loosened as her body relaxed, swiveling her hips around him as she stared down at him. 

"Mmmm, now you got me warmed up, babe," she said, her body gyrating slowly with a liquid ease as the small orgasms the white husband had given her had taken the edge off the tension inside her. The married man's cock still buried to the root up her tight cunt, which was squeezing him tightly, keeping him frozen with pleasure. She reached up over him to grab the headboard, her enormous black boobs hanging down just above his face, jiggling deliciously with every slight motion of hers, making him drool. "And now that you got me warmed up, me and you can really FUCK!" she spat out, staring at him hungrily as she squeezed her cunt around his shaft. Zack steeled himself, knowing the pace of this was about to pick up. 

The young white husband had no idea what he was about to experience. 

Vanessa lifted herself about halfway up his throbbing pillar before dropping back down, her ass slamming into his thighs. She repeated this motion a few times, lifting herself higher up along his greased shaft, picking up the pace on each bounce. With the way she was bouncing and popping her ass with each bounce, she was soon bouncing perfectly, rising all the way up so just the fat tip of his married dong was left inside her, locked in by her squeezing black cunt, before slamming herself back down, smothering his entire length in her tight, mature pussy. She began doing this on each bounce with no trouble, as if she just naturally knew how to ride a big, fat cock to its full potential, taking every fat fucking inch on every bounce, like a true slut. The steady smacks of their naked skin slapping into each other echoed through the room and the noises only got louder as she began riding him harder and faster. 

"You like that?" the older black woman demanded, snarling at the prone man beneath her. His body was tensed, as if even a simple movement on his part would make him explode. But she wouldn't have that. This white boy wasn't just gonna lay down and just let her do her thing. No, this white boy was gonna fuck her brains out! She just had to spur him into action. She pulled one hand from the headboard and slapped his bare chest, sending a jolt through him. "Tell me! You like that? You like that shit!?" she screamed out at the married man beneath her. She saw a fire pass across his face for a moment. 

"Fuck you!" Zack grunted out, still holding out. The older black woman put her hand back on the headboard and picked up the face, riding him rougher, slamming her ass into him, trying to drive through the bed. 

"Talk to me, baby," Vanessa demanded, driving herself into him, flexing her cunt around his shaft, trying to make him give into to the pleasure she was giving him. "I know you love this! You ain't getting this good shit from that white bitch you married! Just tell me, baby... fuck! Tell me how much you love this! Tell Mama how much you love her old, tight, black pussy! White boy needs the black pussy! YES!" she screamed out, her language devolving as this fuck session went on. 

The mirror behind them reflected raw sexuality on display as they went at it. Even though she could only be seen from behind, the mirror had a primo view of her amazing black ass, her long, taut back, and even from behind the sides of her massive udders could be seen. Even though she was older and had some extra curves, Vanessa's natural athleticism was on display, smoothly popping her hips as she rode the white man beneath her, her round, juicy ass bouncing, her ass cheeks spreading apart in a steady rhythm as she rode him, exposing the full length of her ass crack and her taut asshole. The skin contrast between them was amazing, her heated, sweat-coated black skin sliding against his white flesh. And the sight of his ivory staff sliding into her tight, dark body, as if submitting to the darkness, an admission that he wanted to be consumed by it. 

Zack grit his teeth together, trying to withstand the onslaught of pleasure, unable to open his mouth for fear of vocalizing his true feelings. His eyes fell to her enormous, bouncing breasts. They were so huge, and seeing them in action was another level of pleasure. He had never seen tits so big, and her smooth, dark sweaty skin just added to their appeal and newness. His eyes were locked on her throbbing suckable nipples, bouncing before his eyes, hypnotizing him. 

"You like my tits, baby?" Vanessa asked, slamming her large, black ass into him, her toned arms still giving her leverage as she fucked him. "Fuck! YES! You love my fucking big, black tits, don't you? Don't you!? You've tried to hide it, but you couldn't take your eyes off them all fucking day! Haha! Fuck yeah, that's good! That's some good dick!" she said, fucking the conflicted married man, wearing him down with each bounce. "Talk to me, baby... talk to Mama. Tell me how much you love my tits. Their so big... so soft... so black. C'mon baby, give them another squeeze. You've already done it... how can you stop yourself now? They're so perfect... don't you want your hands all over them? Ugh! Fuck yes, that's good white dick! Don't you want to touch them? Don't you want to squeeze them? Don't you want put your face in them and fucking drown in them?" 

Zack was still frozen with tension, his manly jaw clenched as he tried not to give in. Her smooth, sexy voice and the rhythmic, delicious bouncing of her huge black breasts were seeping their way into his mind, overwhelming his apprehension, slowly replacing all other thoughts with images of big, black, bouncy tits. Seeing Vanessa's enormous black boobs in the flesh was an image he would never be able to forget. It was an image his lizard brain was feasting on, that was being etched permanently in his thoughts, an image that would define nasty, illicit, raw sexuality. An image that would be at the forefront of sexual appeal, an image he would go to when he just had to unleash a heavy load from his massive nuts. 

It was his lizard brain that was in control as his hands rose from the bed, seeking salvation in the older woman's amazingly big breasts as they bounced above him. They were bouncing so lusciously above him that, despite his inner conflict, he just had to give them a firm squeeze. He had to feel them in his palms again. He had felt them before, sure, but he was now currently balls deep in a tight black pussy, so the added sensation of a pair of huge tits in his hands might make him lose it completely. They were right above him, bouncing... jiggling. The dark, sexy flesh, coated with sweat, looking so round and perky and firm, just dying to be touched. His hands got close, and he didn't have the will to pull them back. His hands got closer... and closer... and closer... and just when his greedy fingers were about to make contact... 4

"Oh, no you don't!" Vanessa said, moving smoothly to grab his wrists and slam them into the bed, stopping the hypnotized young husband in his tracks. She paused in her bouncing, grinding her hungry cunt around the stiff, white pole, squeezing the massive organ, driving the young man crazy. 

"Please!" he grunted out, squirming beneath her as she pinned him down. Her massive udders were hanging down, her smooth black breast-flesh sliding against his sweaty chest. He could feel her hard, thick nipples scraping his chest, making him shiver. He looked up into her cocky eyes as he tried to escape her tight grip and get his hands on those titties. 

"Oh no, baby... you could have made this nice and easy, but you had you to go an act the fool," Vanessa said, squeezing her cunt around Zack's dick to keep him on edge as she pinned him down. "I control these perfect tits, and you need to play by my rules if you want to touch. Listen to me... this doesn't end till we fuck! Not this lame-ass shit you're trying to pull. I ain't your wife. I'm your wife's boss, not some dumb little white bitch who'll take what she can get. Black women like me don't abide this weak-ass shit! Black women don't make love. That shit doesn't matter to us. Black women FUCK!" she spat out, her filthy lecture sending a ripple of lust through him. "We don't moan softly. Black women scream out! Black women cuss and swear and demand more! White girls break hearts. Black bitches break beds! So if you want to play in the big leagues, you need to step up to the plate. I want your hands on my hot body. I want to hear you talk! I want to hear you swear! I want to get your fucking best! I want you to unleash the beast! I want you to FUCK ME!" she screamed out, before leaning down and savagely bringing her lips to his, forcing her tongue into the young husband's mouth again. Her sinewy tongue slipped against his as they furiously made out, this added sensation almost eroding the young man's fight. She pulled her tongue from his throat and hovered above him again, her cunt still juicing his massive organ. She moved forwards till her huge jugs were dangling inches from the young man's face. 

"Now..." Vanessa began, her tone shifting from lecturing to one of soft, firm seduction. "If you want to get your hands on Mama's big titties, tell me what I want to hear," she insisted, holding his gaze. Unable to stop the lewd thoughts from controlling his actions, he opened his mouth and began to speak. 

"I love them..." he said, his eyes locked on her bare chest, the words escaping Zack's throat, as if they had been barely contained within him. "They're amazing... I've never seen a pair like them." 

"They better than Mandy's itty bitty white titties?" Vanessa asked, her lips curled up smugly. 

"Yes," he relented, releasing the tension inside him by finally admitting this truth. "You have better tits than my wife, and it's... it's not even close. They're so much bigger... rounder... so fucking black!" he grunted out, squirming beneath her wicked stare and squeezing pussy. 

"Then how could you marry a woman with such small, pathetic breasts?" Vanessa asked, leaning down to run her tongue against his pronounced jawline, moving close to his ear. "How could you love someone when her tits are that small?" She let that hang in his mind before continuing. "A woman like me... a woman with tits like mine deserves a lot of love, don't I? I'm more worthy of your love than your wife ever was... right?" Vanessa asked, her tits hovering in front of his face again, her hard nipples calling for his mouth. 

"Yes..." Zack relented, eyes still locked on her tits, his judgment being swayed by her bulbous black orbs. 

"You admit the truth?" Vanessa asked. "You love my hot black body more than your wife?" 

"Yes," Zack seethed out, literally pleading for the pleasure she was withholding from him. But still, she held him down. 

"Do you love my big tits more than you love your wife? Answer me this time!" she commanded, repeating the earlier question that had stopped him before. 

"Yes!" Zack called out. "YES! I love your fucking tits more than my wife, okay?" he admitted, making the black woman smirk. 

"I knew it," she said, squeezing her cunt around him. "Do you love me more than you love your new wife?" Vanessa inquired. "You just married her, and you just met me, but my hot black body was enough to change your mind. My big tits were enough to make you throw away all those loving feelings you have for her, and make you fall so deep in love with me. So tell me... do you love your wife's 44-year-old black boss more than you ever loved her?" she asked, eyes blazing with heat as her dripping cunt massaged his aching member. 

"Yes!" Zack called out, his body fully tensed. "I love you more than I love her! I love everything about you! I would do... ugh fuck... I would do fucking anything for you. To please you, and your hot black body. Please, Vanessa. Please!" Zack pleaded, aching to touch those massive, soft breasts. Ready to lose his pure heart and soul forever by immersing himself in that hot black body. He was so in love with her it wasn't even funny. He wanted her more than he wanted any other woman ever. She was so fucking good at this, giving him what he had always craved. Dominance. Subjugation. 

She held him in place, squeezing her black pussy around his aching member while she stared down at him, enjoying the slow torture she was putting him through. She was happy to drive the young married man insane with lust, so insane that he would do anything she asked of him. 

"Mama doesn't want to hurt you, baby," Vanessa purred, squeezing her taut cunt around his shaft teasingly as she tortured him with a pleasure that was just out of reach. "Mama just wants to make you feel really..." she said, tightening her pussy around him. "...really..." she repeated, squeezing his cock again. "...really..." Squeeze. "...really good. Don't you want to feel good, hon?" His mouth was opened in a pained sigh, fighting the pleasure she was bringing him. Her hard nipple was hovering just above his open mouth. She leaned down to brush her hard nipple across his lips, but before his mouth could capture the hard nub, she pulled it away. His mouth leapt up, searching for the hard nipple he sampled, but it was out of reach. Pained that he could find some new pleasure, he sighed, closed his eyes, and let his head fall back to the bed. 

"Stay with me, baby," Vanessa said, locking her cunt around his throbbing prick, bringing him back to life, his eyes opening back up. "Now tell me... do you want to feel good?" Vanessa cooed. 

"I need to cum!" Zack begged, getting right to the point. 

"And if you want Mama to make you feel good, you need to make Mama feel good... do you understand?" she purred, knowing he was so overwhelmed that her words were resonating deep inside him. "My pleasure is all that should matter to you. And if you make me happy... if you give me pleasure... if you make me cum, then I'll make you happy. I'll give you pleasure. I'll make you cum. Do you understand? Baby, you shouldn't be begging to cum... you should be begging to fuck me! Begging to make me cum! Now, tell me... what do you want?" She asked, looking down at him, smirking at her complete control over the strong, young, white husband. 

"Please," he groaned, eyes blazing with fury and desperation. "Please... let me fuck you," he relented. "Let me put my hands on your hot black body. I want to touch you! I want to fuck you till you fucking scream! I'll do anything you want! Anything! I'll fuck your fucking brains out while my wife is passed out next to us! I'll make your fucking black pussy cum on my fucking married dick! I live for your fucking sexy black body! Please! I'll do anything!" Zack begged. Smiling, and finally satisfied with his level of submission, she released his wrists and sat up, swiveling on his throbbing post. It took him a moment to realize his hands were free. He looked up at her smug face and anger played across his face. He was a strong young man, and he could easily reach up and toss this scheming black bitch aside and go back to his wife, not giving into her. He could still easily convince himself that he had never fully given into his wife's evil boss. He could just use his big manly hands to push her off of him and escape her evil clutches. The hand that carried the symbol of his love and affection for his wife around his ring finger could be the used to defend himself from the evil woman's advances, and stand as a beacon to the strength of his love for his wife and their marriage. It would be poetic. It would be so easy. 

But instead, he rose from the bed and placed his hands on the older woman's perfect black tits. 

"Aww, yeah!" Vanessa moaned out, knowing she had fully conquered the white husband. Any objections the young man might have had had been pushed out of him by the older woman's squeezing pussy. His hands leapt to her absolutely massive breasts, his fingers digging into the luscious, soft flesh. He squeezed her huge black tits over and over again, gripping them hard, not wanting to ever let them go. He squeezed them roughly, before reaching down, cupping them in his palms and then guiding one of her nipples to his hungry mouth. He attacked one of her throbbing nipples, inhaling it in his married mouth, his lips pressing into her soft breast as he tried to take as much of her tit-flesh in his mouth as he could. Their naked bodies pressed together, Vanessa reached around and grabbed the back of his head, forcing his face against her sweaty tits. She pushed them back to the bed, her soft breasts molding around his face as he was forced against the mattress. His hands were forced away from her tits, so he reached around her, wrapping his arms around her body. He slid one of his hands down to her ass, squeezing the full, round, black cheek. 

"That's it, baby, that's it!" Vanessa said, rewarding the young man's touch by resuming her bouncing on his throbbing prick, holding her tits in place against his face as she did so. She resumed her precise, expert fucking, soon bouncing from knob to root again, his juice-coated white cock sliding smoothly in-and- out of her overfilled black cunt. Their skin was slapping together, her ass slamming into his thighs. He kept his hand on her ass, assisting her in their rough fucking as he helped force her down into him. He began to match her pace, driving up into her as she drove down into him. "That's it, baby! Fuck yes! Fuck me with that big white cock, baby! YES!" Vanessa squealed. 

His mouth was still stuffed with her throbbing nipple as he eagerly sucked and chewed on the rubbery cap. She pulled her hard nipple from his mouth before motor-boating him with her massive black udders, sliding her huge, heavy black tits across his married face, slapping him in the face with the huge orbs, resting the weighty jugs on his handsome features, the sweat from her bulbous rack smearing onto him. Her huge boobs were literally smothering him to the point where he was forced to breathe the sweet heated air from her deep valley of her cleavage to gain oxygen. She pulled her tits off his face for a moment, letting him gasp for air for a few moments before stuffing her other nipple into his hungry mouth. 

As Zack squeezed her round, jutting ass with his hand, he wrapped his other arm around her waist, allowing him the leverage to drive up into her as she rode his hard white prick. 

"Yeah, baby! YES! Fuck me! YES! FUCK! FUCK! YES!" Vanessa screamed. "Fuck me with that white dick! Fuck me better than you ever fucked your ugly wife! Give me that white dick! That fucking dick belongs to me, baby! It belongs to me! Fuck my fucking nasty cunt with that massive young cock! Didn't your momma ever tell you not to give that cock to evil old ladies? Fuck yes! Well, you love it! You love fucking old women... fuck... old fucking black women! That's it! Yes! Fuck that fucking pussy, baby! FUCK ME!" 

She was rocking against him more violently as their fuck session got more intense. Both of the new lovers were covered with sweat, and her body was sliding on his as she rode his fat white dick hard! But a woman like her needed it even harder. She had a few mini orgasms, but she needed to cum hard. She pushed herself up, pulling her big breasts from his face, and grabbed the headboard. Using the added leverage, she began slamming her body into him, the wet smacks of their sweat-soaked skin reverberating down the halls of the hotel. 

"FUCK! AWWW! YES! YES! UGH! FUCK!" Vanessa screamed out. "Fuck me with that fat married cock! Fuck my tight black cunt with that white cock! YES!" 

"Amazing!" Zack grunted out, still tasting her tits on his tongue. "Holy shit!" he groaned, shocked at the ferocity of this fuck. 

"You like it, baby?" Vanessa asked. Zack looked up, eyes locked onto her huge, slippery, sweat-soaked tits, glistening in the light. He reached up and grabbed them again, squeezing her huge black breasts once more, pinching her hard nipples. "YES! Tell me! TELL ME! You like it? YOU LIKE THAT SHIT?" she screamed at him. 

"I love it!" Zack screamed out. "You're incredible! You're cunt is fucking incredible! The best fucking cunt I've ever had my dick in! You're pussy's amazing! I love your black cunt! Yes!" 

"You're done with white girls, aren't cha?" Vanessa asked. "You ain't going back to white pussy again after this! After feeling my nasty black cunt!" 

"No! No more white girls," Zack replied. "Black pussy is so fucking good! I never fucking knew it could be this good!" It was true. He had fucked a lot of white pussy, but this black cunt was on another level. It squeezed his cock so fucking hard, and massaged every inch of it. It could take his full length and treat it 

to a worshipful, indescribable pleasure. This one black pussy was better than all the other pussy he had felt. 

"Oh FUCK!" Vanessa screamed, her cunt spasming around his cock, a prelude to the big one that was coming soon. His cock was granite, unflinching as it split open her hungry cunt again and again. It had been held at edge for so long it had found its second wind. It could fuck for hours at this point. It was driving the black woman wild, her juices pouring down his smooth shaft with every bounce. Sex had never been this good for the slutty older woman. Her black pussy was loving the white man's throbbing weapon. 

Zack sat back up, wrapping his arms around her waist, his mouth attacking her black tits again. His tongue licked her huge breasts, circling and flicking against the hard nipple as his lips wrapped around the smooth areola. As he held her tight against him with his muscular arms, their bodies slid against each other. Both sat up on the bed, her mature, succulent black flesh sliding against his taut white skin. She rose in his lap before dropping down, her ass slamming into his legs hard. As Vanessa wrapped her arms around his neck, Zack gripped her ass with both hands, driving himself up into her as she slammed into him. 

"Yes! YES! Fuck me, baby! Fuck me! Fuck my black pussy with that married dick! Drive that fucking cock in my hot cunt and make me scream! YES! YES!" Vanessa screamed out, clutching him tight. The gentle tug of his mouth on her tits was that little extra something that was driving her insane. She was gonna cum soon, and she was gonna cum hard! 

"Suck my tits, baby!" Vanessa screamed. "Suck my big, black tits, honey! You've wanted to suck my big tits all day! You've wanted to suck them since the moment we met! Didn't you! Didn't you?!" 

"YES!" Zack called out, pulling his mouth from her throbbing nipple and sliding his face against her dark cleavage, the heated black skin sliding against his face. "I wanted to suck these fucking huge knockers since I met you! I wanted to suck and squeeze them before the wedding! I wanted to scrub my face in your cleavage as soon as my wife got drunk and stupid at the reception! I wanted to suck your fucking huge black tits on the fucking wedding altar in front of my wife! In front of all my friends and family! I couldn't stop thinking about them!" He resumed hungrily sucking her big, bouncing tits, tugging on her nipples with his mouth as she drove her ass into his lap roughly. 

"YES! FUCK YES!" Vanessa moaned out. "Baby, it was all I could fucking think about too! I wanted your mouth on my perfect tits so bad! Fuck yeah! I love it! I love this dick! I've needed my tits worshipped for such a long time, and I just knew you were the man for the job. YES! UGH FUCK! Yeah! I had to stop myself from shoving my tits in your face all day! I want you to suck my tits forever, baby! I want your mouth on my fucking nipples every fucking day! I want you to suck my big jugs! I want to fucking nurse you! I want you to drink my fucking breast milk! Yes! YES!" she called out as the married man sucked her nipples harder at this last statement. Her cunt was twitching and spasming. She was getting very, very close. 

"Mmmm, guuhhh!" Zack grunted into her tits, his mouth full of nipple. He was in absolute bliss. His stamina was being pushed beyond its limits already, and her crazy-tight black pussy was making him lose it. His cock was swelling up, ready to finally burst with its long awaited, creamy load. 

"Yeah, baby, yeah!" Vanessa moaned, driving into him, flexing her ass and grinding against his cock before bouncing again roughly. "C'mon, baby! Yeah, that's it! Grab my ass, hon! Grab my fucking ass! Yeah, that's it!" Zack slid his big, manly hands down and grabbed two major helpings of black booty. He dug into the firm mounds roughly, feeling the dark, pliant, sweaty flesh between his fingers, grabbing hold and pulling her down into him. "Fuck me baby, fuck me! Fuck me with that white dick! Fuck me because you love me more than your ugly wife! Yeah, that's it!" she called out, feeling him drive up even harder into her greedy cunt at that. "You're a nasty one, baby! I knew it! I knew you were fucking filthy! Yes! YES! Fuck your wife's fucking slutty old boss! Fuck my black pussy! Make that pussy cum, baby! Make Mama cum! Yeah! Yes! YES! FUCK YES! YES! YES! Give me that big cock! YES! YES! YES! AH! AH! AH!" she screamed out in his ear, her cunt quivering around his swollen shaft. 

Zack was too far gone at this point. His lizard brain was in control, and what was driving his actions was the unyielding need to cum! He'd been storing hot, thick cum in his nuts for just this night and now it was time to give his load to its rightful recipient. The woman who had earned it. The woman who deserved it, not his inferior, passed out, small-breasted wife. He always knew it would end like this, despite his best efforts. He always knew, deep down, that his marriage would end not in some romantic ancestral house, years in the future, a house built on the foundation of the love he and his wife had built together. No, he always knew his marriage would end in the arms of some slut, his naked dick buried up her steamy twat, his hands on her hot, naked, voluptuous body, his load exploding inside her fertile womb, and making illicit, out-of-wedlock babies. 

He just didn't think it would happen this fast. 

"I'm gonna cum, Vanessa," Zack grunted out, his face against her soft tits. "I'm gonna cum in your filthy cunt! I'm gonna fucking cum inside you! I'm gonna fucking cum in your tight black pussy!" 

"Yeah, baby, do it!" Vanessa groaned, her cunt quivering, arms clutched tightly around his neck. "Give me that nut, baby! Give me that married nut! I want to feel it inside me! Give Mama that thick married cum!" His cock jolted in response. He was gonna lose it. 

"I want to cum!" Zack grunted. "I want to cum in your fucking cunt! I want to cum in Mama's hot cunt!" 

"Oh fuck!" Vanessa screamed out, turning a corner. She bounced up and down, sweat dripping off of her. She drove down till his full length was inside her then flexed her cunt around him, trying to coax the load from his balls. "Yes! YES! YES! Cum in Mama's cunt, baby! Cum in me! CUM INSIDE ME! YES! YES! YES! Give me that married cum while your wife is passed out in the bathroom like a fucking fool! Cum inside me and forget about your wife forever! UGHHH! YES! YES! YES! UGH! YEAH! FUCK! Give me babies! Give me babies! Give me fucking white babies! YES!" 5

"Oh my God! I'm gonna do it!" Zack moaned out. "I'm gonna cum inside you while my fucking boring, dumbass wife sleeps... through... it! YES! YES! AHHHH!" As he turned the corner, his jaw clenched and his teeth bit down firmly on the black woman's rubbery nipple. This jolt of pleasure, combined with hearing the young married man trash talk his own wife, set the black woman off. 

"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH! YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHH!" Vanessa grunted, her body tensed as her black pussy locked around the base of his white married shaft, its full length buried inside her. "YES! YES! FUCK! YES! FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKK YYYYEEAAAAHHHH!" Vanessa squealed, a huge wave of pleasure rocking her luscious body. Her body shivered as she came, every nerve- ending being driven wild by the intense white dicking she was receiving. Her orgasm was enough to take the married man over the edge. 

"FFFUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK! UGHHHHHHHHHHH GGGGODDDDDD!" Zack grunted savagely, and after weeks of holding out, the married man finally came. His nuts were flexing as the first stream of thick cum fired up his shaft, blasting out into the older black woman's clutching, squeezing hole. Jet after jet of his hot, thick nut exploded from his married dick, straight into his wife's boss's pussy. 

"YESSSSS! YES! I feel it! I feel that nut inside me!" Vanessa squealed, clutching the married man tight as she felt his creamy load entering her ready cunt. He exploded over and over again, deep inside her pussy, each stream of cum as big as the last. It was the biggest load of his life, and it wasn't even that close. None of the white girls he had ever hooked up with, even the super slutty ones who could really fuck, none of them even came close to conjuring up the kinda load this older black woman had inspired in him. And the type of orgasms he had with Mandy... those were a drizzle. This was a flood of thick cum leaving his nuts, flowing directly into the evil black woman's cunt. 

They remained clutched together as they fell back onto the bed, their bodies flexing against each other as they rode out their massive orgasms. Her juices were squirting from her pussy onto his contracting nuts. 

"FUCK! FUCK! FUCK YEAH BABY! FUCK YOUR MAMA!! Fill Mama's cunt up, baby! YES! Give it to me! Give me a baby! YES!" Vanessa squealed. 

"God damn! Yes! So good! So fucking good!" Zack groaned out, the pleasure so good it was almost painful. His balls kept firing more and more hot cum up into the older woman. Her nails dug into his neck as she kept cumming, her body flexing as their hot, naked bodies slid against each other. 

This went on for a few moments as they rode out this wave of pleasure, their language devolving into grunts and moans. As Zack's balls exploded into Vanessa's tight cunt, Zack entered a whole new plane of pleasure. White light burst into his vision, obscuring the delicious sights in front of him, and it was only as he came down from his high that the white light behind his eyes was overtaken by darkness. 

Finally, at nearly the same moment, both of their bodies relaxed. Vanessa's slick, sweat-soaked body slid off of him, panting for breath as she slid onto her back next to the married man, his tube-steak sliding out from her black pussy, plopping onto his belly with a wet smack, still mostly hard. The older black woman's legs were spread lewdly, and as she glanced down at herself, not a single drop of the younger man's cum had leaked out of her. In the same way the dehydrated soil of a flood ravaged farm greedily accepted every drop of rain-water, her needy, fertile cunt accepted every fucking drop of thick, married, white-boy cum, hungrily sucking it up and not letting a single drop go to spare. 

This was why she loved white dick. White dick was very, very good to her. White dick made her cunt go crazy, the way no other dick could. Her pussy LOVED the white cock, and after what she just went through, there was no way she was giving it up. 

Zack's lizard brain kept him conscious, despite the fact that every nerve in his body was ready for rest. He was tethered to consciousness by his still hard cock, keeping him awake and alert. As he fully came down from his high and his vision cleared, he looked around to reassess, now able to think slightly clearly. 

Zack was panting, trying to deal with what just happened. Now that it had happened, now that he had cheated, he had expected to feel intense waves of guilt and regret. But, having done it, having finally cheated on Mandy, he felt strangely... content. It wasn't so much a mistake as it was him accepting what he truly was. This was what he was built for. This was what he was meant for. Having dirty, filthy sex with equally filthy women. His mind was at peace, the type of peace that can only come from finding your true place in life. There was of course some regret at betraying his wife, but that didn't matter to him. Mandy was a sweet girl, but she wasn't the girl for him. She couldn't keep up with his needs, and their marriage was doomed for failure. What mattered at this point was his own journey towards true happiness and inner peace. What mattered was truly finding his place in life. What mattered now as finishing what he started. 

He looked down and noticed his still erect weapon lying in place on his taut belly, ready to go. And despite the fact that he had just drained the biggest load of his life into Vanessa's amazing black pussy, he still felt that same unyielding pressure from his nuts. He smirked wickedly and looked next to him, his eyes glancing at her black, sweaty, mountainous peaks, rising up and down as she panted for breath. 

Zack wasn't done. Far from it. 

Before Vanessa could react, Zack leapt into action. 

"You're not finished yet, are you?" Zack taunted her, lifting the black woman up, rearranging her till she was on all fours in front of him. 

"Oh... oh my..." Vanessa called out in surprise as she was moved around, looking behind her as Zack moved into place behind her, looking like a predator ready to pounce as his hungry eyes stared at her naked body. "You little fucker... I knew there was a monster in there. Do your worst... I can take it," she dared him, turning to look straight forward, her eyes meeting her own gaze in the mirror. 

She looked amazing, like pure, unadulterated sex. She looked so good, she just had to smirk with pride. On all fours, her huge tits hanging down, her nipples kissing the bed. Her entire body was still slick with sweat, adding another layer to her nasty appeal. Her lithe, arched back led to her large, round, juicy ass, pointed up in the air, looking perfectly shaped as it was pointed directly at the married man behind her. And he was staring right at it. 

"You've been shaking this at me all day," Zack said, his tone unrecognizable, utilizing a confidence and swagger he hadn't let reach the surface in years. He reached up and casually spanked her large, round ass, making the cheek jiggle deliciously. She looked over her shoulder at him, eyes blazing with lust. He leaned forward and handled both round rump cheeks with his manly paws, squeezing the firm flesh greedily. "Shaking this ass in my face like a complete slut, making me think bad thoughts at my own wedding." 

"Yeah, baby! That's right! That's fucking right I was!" Vanessa snarled as the young husband squeezed her ass. "I wanted to show all the white boys what a real woman's ass looked like! I wanted my ass dominating your thoughts when you said 'I do'! I wanted to make that fucking dick of yours rock hard whenever I strutted by! That's it baby, play with my ass!" 

"You made me so fucking hard when you sat on my lap," Zack admitted, letting his hand touch the full expanse of her large, round cheeks. 

"I know, baby, I know," Vanessa said, her boobs swaying gently as she pushed her ass back towards the married man's eager hands. "With the way you were grinding that big dick of yours against me, I think I could have taken you right then. Fucked you right there at the reception in front of your pathetic wife! Fuck yeah, that's hot!" Vanessa said, a shiver of lust coursing down her spine. 

"This hot ass has had me drooling since I first saw it," Zack said huskily, leaning in close as he jiggled her firm cheeks in his palms. 

"Show me a white girl who has an ass like this," Vanessa boasted, shaking her butt from side-to-side. 

"It's the best ass I've ever seen," Zack said, his voice full of lust, as he leaned forward to give one of the large black cheeks a juicy kiss. 

"That's it baby! Kiss Mama's ass!" Vanessa called out, feeling the younger man's lips repeatedly smack against her black ass, worshipfully kissing both cheeks. This went on for a few moments before Zack pulled back and placed both hands back on her ass, one on each cheek. Then, with a quick jolt, he pulled the large cheeks apart, exposing the full expanse of her ass crack to his greedy eyes. "Oh... you're a nasty one! I love it!" She called out. 

Zack's eyes were locked on her exposed ass crack, his gaze focusing directly on her asshole. It had been so long since he had seen a woman so exposed to him, her perfect, clean, tight asshole making him drool. And after years of being trained to enjoy the act, he was ready to give the older woman the same worshipful treatment he used to give all those slutty girls years prior. The act he had grown to become addicted to. With no hesitation, Zack stuck out his tongue and leaned forward, running his tongue up along the length of her ass crack. 

"Oh, that's it baby, get in there," Vanessa sighed. "Get all up in Mama's ass!" 

Zack's famished tongue was drooling with hunger as he focused his attention on her tight ass, rimming the tight hole with his tongue. His stiff tongue lavished attention on the older black woman's asshole, soaking it with spit, licking the tight hole and even kissing it with his newly married lips, giving the same treatment to this old lady's asshole that he gave to his wife on the altar of the church. And this moment was easily the superior memory. 

"Stab it, baby! Stab it!" Vanessa moaned. "I want to feel that tongue inside my ass!" Zack did as commanded, stiffening his tongue and jabbing it against her tight, spit-soaked hole, trying to break through. "C'mon, hon... get that tongue in Mama's ass." Zack shoved his face as deeply as could in the older black woman's ass crack, stabbing his tongue against the firm sphincter. And then, after minutes of trying to break through... 

"AHHHHH FUCK!" Vanessa screamed out as Zack's tongue penetrated her, entering her tight asshole. Zack stabbed his tongue in and out of the black woman's ass. Vanessa's eyes flashed with lust as she reached back to dig her hand into the young man's scalp, holding him in place against her rear. 

She looked forward at the image reflected in the mirror. Her, on all fours, her big, black breasts hanging lusciously below her, her ass posed upward behind her, and there, smothered between her round smooth cheeks, was the married man's handsome face. His manly features were being obscured he was so deep in her black booty. But knowing she was grinding her juicy ass against that handsome white boy's face sent a jolt of lust through her. 

He went on like this, fucking her ass with his tongue, followed by some delightful rimming of her tight hole, hitting her in just the right way like he was scratching an itch, making her toes curl in the process. He was truly enjoying the act, feeling his face buried between the older woman's round, luscious ass cheeks, his tongue worshipping her tightest hole, coating it with his heated saliva. Part of his enjoyment was in the submission, pleasuring the older woman's most revered hole in such a raw, filthy manner. He loved it, and he didn't realize how much he had missed doing it till right this moment. 

Finally, knowing the job was done, he pulled his tongue from her tight hole, leaning back to admire the spit-soaked hole. But Vanessa's hand still maintained its grip, forcing him to give her tight hole a bit more tongue worship before releasing him. Zack panted for breath as he reached down and gave his stiff dick a few courtesy strokes, making sure he was ready to go. But the teasing she had put him through, and the stimulus that was her hot fucking black body, had given him incredible endurance, it seemed. It felt like he could go all night at this rate. His cock was like iron, and he moved upward, placing the tip of his pulsing dick against the older woman's ass crack. 

"Oh, yeah baby," Vanessa purred, straightening up on all fours, getting ready for what was about to happen. "You want to fuck Mama's ass, honey?" 

"Yeah, I've wanted to fuck this ass all day," Zack grunted, grabbing her hip with one hand while steadying his cock with the other. He placed the tip against her asshole and teased the tight hole a little bit. 

"Such a nasty boy," Vanessa teased. "Marrying your young little white wife while fantasizing about sticking that filthy dick of yours inside some black booty!" 

"This is what you made me do," Zack began. "I didn't want to cheat, but you strutted around, showing off your big jiggling tits and this amazing fucking ass in that filthy dress of yours... this is what you get. This is what that gets you." At that, Zack began to push forward, gripping her hips hard, pulling her back against him. He flexed his hips, trying to force his cock inside Vanessa's tight, unyielding asshole. 

"Oh my God!" Vanessa sighed, biting her lip and closing her eyes as she felt the thick white weapon trying to force its way inside her rear end. Wincing slightly as she felt her asshole begin to stretch, she still pushed back, eager to get that fat white dick up her tight ass. "Do it, you motherfucker! Do it! Fuck my ass! Fuck my black ass! Do i... oooohhhhhhhhh my GGGGGGGODDDDDDDD! Yes! YES!" Vanessa moaned out loudly as her tight ass gave in, stretching around Zack's meaty tube-steak. 

Zack's body jerked forward as the first few inches of his married cock entered the black woman's yielding asshole. Her tight hole was wrapped snugly around his pulsing shaft, squeezing the fuck out of his needy dick. He had forgotten how good anal sex felt, but here, kneeling behind this older black woman, feeling her ass gripping his fat cock like there was no tomorrow, he wondered how he could have stopped himself from experiencing this for so long. It felt amazing! He pushed another inch or two inside her and shuddered with excitement. He had resigned himself to the fact that he would never be having anal sex again. Mandy was so NOT the type of girl to be into this kind of thing. And even if she was into it... she was so petite Zack feared it would break the poor girl. No, this kind of thing needed to be done with a real woman, a woman who could take it. A woman like Vanessa, who had the body and the curves to be able to handle this kind of rough, nasty sex. Zack grit his teeth and pushed forward again, driving his cock into her, making her take a few more inches. 

"Holy fuck, that's good!" Zack grunted out. 

"Fuck! Keep going, baby!" Vanessa moaned out. "Fill Mama's ass with that big married dick! C'mon baby! Mama wants the whole thing!" Knowing his dick was lodged in place, he gripped his hands on her hips and drove forward hard, forcing most of his fat cock inside her. "Aaahhhh! GGGGOOODDD! Yes! YES!" Vanessa screamed. Zack was leaning over her, most of his big dick lodged impossibly in her tight, squeezing ass. Her ass was gripping him so hard! It was incredible, the tightest fucking hole he had ever felt. He fucked in-and- out lightly, testing how good the stretched but gripping hole felt sliding up and down his shaft. "All the way, baby. ALL THE WAY!" Vanessa screamed out, seething with lust. Zack reared back and drove forward, driving his cock all the way inside her black ass, till his heavy balls slapped against her naked cunt. 

"UGGGGHHHHHH! FFFFUUUUCKKK! AHHHHH!" Vanessa moaned gutturally, her ass filled with fat, white dick. She had tipped forward slightly, her cheek against the bed as her ass got used to the massive white intruder. He held her tight against him, savoring the sensation of her asshole swallowing his cock to the root. Her juicy ass pressed into his torso as he ground against her, grinding his cock in the older woman's tight asshole. 

"Jesus Christ!" Zack cried out, almost in tears this felt so good. Both of them savored the sensation of his cock in her ass, getting used to the indescribable bliss they were both feeling. They both huffed and puffed, their bodies feeling an overload of pleasure. It took a few moments before the tension melted out of Vanessa's body, her tensed muscles relaxing despite the fat cock lodged in her ass. Zack was still tensed, but Vanessa... she was ready. 

"Do it, you son of a bitch!" Vanessa called out, pushing herself back up onto her hands and knees, getting into position. "Fuck my ass, you bastard!" 

Zack's face flashed with impatient anger before he complied, sliding his slick shaft out till only the head was lodged inside her, before driving forward, beginning to pump his cock in-and-out of her. 

"Ugggghhh yeah! Fuck yeah!" Vanessa moaned out. "Give it to me, baby! Give me that fat white dick! Holy shit! That feels so fucking good in my ass! Keep going, baby! Fuck Mama's ass! C'mon! FUCK ME!" 

Zack grit his teeth and dug deep, beginning to piston his marred dick inside her. His cock was still coated with their combined juices, so he was able to work up a smooth, steady pace, digging out room for his big cock deep in her ass. 

"Oh my God! Amazing!" Zack groaned out, the pleasure overwhelming. 

"You like that, baby?" Vanessa asked. "You like fucking Mama's tight ass?" 

"Fuck yeah!" Zack replied, his torso slapping into her black butt. "It's incredible! YES!" Zack moaned out, a shudder running through his body. "So fucking tight!" 

"How does my ass compare to Mandy, hon?" Vanessa asked. "Fuck! Yes... tell me! Tell me how good my ass feels?" 

"It's... fuck... FUCK!" Zack winced. "It's the best fucking sex I've ever had! Mandy's not even fucking close. She's so fucking bad at sex compared to you. FUCK!" Zack groaned. Looking down, he couldn't help but marvel at how her tight asshole inhumanely swallowed his full, thick length to the root. And seeing his white shaft getting swallowed into her dark, tight hole, between her delightfully large, juicy cheeks... it was incredible. Zack held her hips tight and drove into her roughly, his hips slamming into her, making her ass cheeks ripple with each impact. He reached forward and grabbed her hair, yanking back as he drove into her. 

"UGGHHH! FUCK! That's right, baby! Yank my fucking hair! Fuck me fucking hard, baby! Fuck my fucking brains out! Yes... YES!" she screamed out. Zack tugged her hair forcefully, pulling back at it as he fucked her. As he did this, he leaned forward, sliding his other hand under her to feel her big breasts once more. His hand molested her massive udders wildly, touching what he could, feeling up the soft flesh, before getting a good hold of one of her big tits and squeezed the soft, luscious flesh roughly. Their bodies were locked against each other as Zack's powerful hips drove them both forward. 

"Yes! YES! Fucking do it, you piece of shit! FUCK MY ASS! FUCK MY ASS YOU MOTHERFUCKING SON OF A BITCH!" Vanessa screamed out. Their faces were next to each other, so she extended her tongue, eager to slide it into his mouth again. Both of them kept jerking forward, making it hard to lock their lips, but their tongues tangled in mid air sloppily, mashing against each other. Zack reached down with his other hand so both were cupping her huge tits, squeezing her massive tanks roughly, over and over again. "You're so fucking good! So good!" she whispered to him, loving the sensation of his hands on her body. His hips kept pumping, forcing his married dick smoothly in-and-out of her tight ass, the amazing hole swallowing his meat completely. 6

"You're the best!" Zack moaned out, driving his cock in an out of her, the pleasure driving him crazy. "You're the best I've ever had! You're a better woman than Mandy in every fucking way! You're hotter! You're older! You're such a better fuck! God damn, you're incredible! My wife is nothing compared you to you!" 

"YESSS!" Vanessa grunted out, her ass spasming around his throbbing meat. "That girl ain't nothing! I'm fucking destroying her life! YES! Thanks to you, I'm fucking ruining her! YES! And what do you do? You fuck my ass harder! You make my ass cum! YES!" 

Zack's hips were a blur as he redoubled his efforts, fucking the older woman's tight orifice as hard as he could. He was in a pure, animalistic state, a mindless fuck machine, pleasuring the older woman's ass in the way it deserved. Vanessa was in bliss as Zack hit spots she hadn't had scratched in years. She was gonna fucking explode! 

"Holy shit, baby! I'm gonna fucking cum! White boy's gonna make my fucking asshole cum! Fuck! I'm gonna cum! Yes! Yes! YES! YES! UUGGGGGHHHHHHHH! YYYYEEEEEESSSSS!" Vanessa screamed out, an orgasm slamming her hot black body as the white husband's unrelenting fucking made her explode in an incredible orgasm. Her body jerked and spasmed, and her ass tightened around the pulsing, concrete shaft as the orgasm rocked her brains out. 

"UUHHHNNNNN! FUCCCKKKK! YEEEAAAAAHHHH!" Vanessa grunted, the orgasm ravaging her. Zack was still holding out, driving his throbbing shaft into her shuddering ass while his hands kept roughly squeezing the older woman's big, black tits. Her rhythmic, squeezing ass was taking him close to the edge, and he couldn't contain himself. 

"I'm getting close!" Zack warned, pumping his fat cock roughly, his balls boiling. Vanessa's body settled down from her rough orgasm and she stayed in position, providing a willing, ready fuck-hole for the married man. 

"Do it, baby!" she sighed. "Give me that cum, you married fucker! Give it to me!" 

"Oh God, oh God! Jesus! Yes! YES! OH FUCK!" Zack grunted. "Here it comes!" he cried out. He surprised the older woman by pulling back, sliding his throbbing cock out of her now gaping asshole. "Get up!" Zack grunted, his cock ready to blow as he got to his feet on the bed, gripping his cock to prevent the cum from exploding from it. Vanessa, ever ready, followed him, kneeling in front of him, holding out her tits as she opened her mouth. Zack released his grip on himself, and seeing the older black woman in this position in front of him was enough to take him over the edge. 

"Uhhhh! FUCK! YES!" Zack grunted out as the first thick band of cum exploded from his cock, firing through the air before landing on her model-like face. 

"Oh my God!" Vanessa moaned, taking the hot cum happily. "Keep it coming, baby!" Jet after jet of cum followed, coating her luscious black features with his thick, creamy seed. Thick lines of cum marked her face and dripped down in thick bands down to her massive rack, followed by a few thick shots directly from the source, landing on her mammoth black breasts. 

"UGGGHHHHH YES!" Zack groaned as more thick cum exploded from his swollen nuts, forcing one of her eyes closed due to the sheer density of his seed. She leaned forward, her plump lips sliding over the head of his exploding cock, just in time for a few more thick bands of creamy cum to fire directly into her hungry mouth. His thick cum coated her tongue as his seed filled her mouth. God, white-boy cum was so fucking good! She gulped down his seed like a thirsty whore, holding his stare with her cold, arrogant gaze, her tongue coaxing the remainder of his seed from his swollen balls. 

Finally, panting, Zack stepped back, pulling his cock from her hungry mouth, a stray drop of cum leaking from the corner of her mouth. She was a mess, the smooth black skin of her face and tits covered by a load of his thick married cum. It was one of the biggest loads of his life, and as he came down from his high, he was forced to fall to one knee while he recovered. He slid down onto his back, gasping for breath as he recovered. Vanessa sat next to him on the bed, sliding the cum on her face down to her hungry mouth with her fingers, keeping one eye on the married man. 

After this long day, Zack was pretty much ready to pass out and call it a day. He breathed deep as his cock finally began to soften. The day was over. He had been married for less than a day, and he had already cheated. It was too crazy to think about, and he would deal with the consequences in the morning. But that would come later. He closed his eyes, ready for some rest. 

Then a few crisp knocks came from the door. 

Zack's eyes jerked open and he looked to the older woman with surprise and concern. Glancing at the door knowingly, she looked back at the married man with a smug smirk. 

"You're not finished yet, are you?" she asked. Zack's eyes widened, his cock began to reverse course, and an unrecognizable grin crossed his lips. A bolt of pure lust went down his spine as he realized that he had just given this woman his best, the kind of sex that had made all those other girls a blissed-out cum-covered mess. But Vanessa... she had taken his best and asked for more. She had taken the type of rough, forceful sex this young man was capable of providing when he fully unleashed his inner beast. She had met every furious thrust as he slammed his thick dick up her tight ass, her body slamming into his, without the least bit of reluctance or shame. She had taken his thick white cock like a complete whore, giving him the type of rough sex he truly needed. 

Zack now fully realized that this woman was on a far higher level than all those girls he had been with before. This was a real woman. An older woman. A black woman. A woman truly built to fuck. She wasn't the type of woman who would settle for a five minute roll in the hay. There would never be enough sex for a woman like Vanessa. She could never be out fucked. Zack looked at her seated next to him, looking like a puma about to pounce. Zack had given her his best, nearly wearing himself out in the process, and she was still ready for more. 

She was perfect. 

Zack had never been as attracted to a woman as he was right then. It didn't matter that she was almost twenty years older than him. It didn't matter that she was black. It didn't matter that she was his wife's boss, and that this was his wedding night. She was the sexiest creature he had ever laid eyes on, and after doing what he just did with her, there was really nothing stopping him from doing it with her again. And again. Getting naughtier and filthier. Doing things he had only dreamed of doing, things he could never do with his wife. It didn't matter that he could never truly out fuck this older black woman, and continuing this affair would only lead to proving her superiority again and again and again. Even if he kept giving her his best, giving her his cock in repeated, nasty, marathon fuck sessions, knowing it would always end with him the one being conquered... the subjugation would be worth it, because the journey would be absolute bliss. 

His cock pulsing once more, he gave the older black woman a wolfish smile. 

Zack's night of debauchery was just getting started. 

************** 

(Eight Hours Later) 

A door clicking shut resonated through the quiet hotel room, and the sudden, sharp noise echoed into the bathroom. And due to this noise, after a long, tumultuous night, Mandy's heavy eyelids finally opened. The entire night was a blur to her. Despite her drunken state, she had been semi-aware of things, but it felt like a dream, and the details were hazy as she found herself unable to recall any specifics. 

Disoriented completely, she peeled her cheek from the cold tile of what appeared to be the floor of a bathroom. Her head was dizzy as she lifted herself into a seated position. She looked around, trying to figure out where the hell she was. 

It was as she glanced around the bathroom that she realized two things. One: She was still wearing her wedding dress. She didn't know how she could have ended up asleep in a bathroom in her wedding night. Whatever she had drunk the night before was fucking strong. The last thing she remembered from the night before was the wedding reception. Everything after that was a blur. 

The other thing she realized was that she was not alone. The fancy, standing shower was occupied, and Mandy could only see a dark figure through the steamy, frosted glass as the water cascaded down. Obviously, it was Zack in the shower, but with how she ended the night, she had no doubt that he was in an equally rough state. 

Supporting herself against the wall, Mandy was able to rise to her two feet. This movement caused her head to scream with the pain of a nasty hangover. As she steadied herself, she noticed the terrible taste in her mouth, and moved to fill a cup with water from the sink and gulp it down. As she did she looked at herself in the mirror. She looked rough. Her hair was a mess, her makeup was a disaster, and her eyes were sunken and swollen. Plus, her dress was a complete, crumpled mess. 

Her bearings began to clear as she rehydrated. She realized that this was probably her wedding suite. She didn't remember coming here at all, but it was really the only possible explanation. If that was the case, all her stuff was here, and judging by her appearance, she definitely didn't want Zack to see her in this state. She moved towards the door, opening it and stepping out, looking to both locate a change of clothes, as well as judge her surroundings for the first time. 

Clad in her wedding dress, the hungover bride stepped out into the hall and made her way towards the large main room of the suite. The room itself looked incredible, with marble floors, a fully stocked bar, fancy decorations, and an amazing view of the city. But it had been diminished slightly by what appeared to be a very rowdy night. There were empty bottles on the bar, furniture pushed all over the place, clothes strewn all over. But her eyes only took in these things for a moment before they landed on the bed. 

On top of the large, expensive looking bed was a man, limbs splayed out, on his back. And he was completely naked. Mandy moved closer, unsure. The man looked like he had just passed out, and the position he was in made it seem that way. He didn't look comfortable. His head wasn't resting on a pillow, and one of his legs was falling over the edge of the bed, resting on the floor. He was completely unconscious, and the slow rhythm of his rising belly was his only sign of movement. As she got closer and saw his face, she confirmed it was her husband Zack, but Zack had never looked like this. She had never seen him passed out like this. He was unrecognizable. Whatever they drank the night before must have been really strong. 

As Mandy got closer, she noticed a few more things. Obviously, since he was naked, his penis was exposed to her, resting on his flat stomach. It looked like it had had a busy night, as it was slightly red. His thighs and lower torso were a matching red, and his belly had smears and streaks of a mystery fluid. She almost slipped and fell on some of the same mystery fluid, but she had caught herself. Looking at her husband, she couldn't help but notice his manly pecs had some slight scratches, and there were some deeper ones on his neck and shoulders. 

What the fuck did they do last night? It didn't feel like she had sex last night, but Zack very clearly did? How was this possible? 

Then the shower turned off, causing Mandy to finally put the pieces together, and realize that the person in the shower wasn't her husband. She didn't know who it was. A sense of dread filled the young wife as she heard movement in the bathroom. Finally, the mystery person, the person who was for some reason showering in her wedding suite, pulled open the door. A mist cascaded out of the steamy bathroom, before a figure appeared, stepping out proudly from the bathroom. Although the steam obscured the person for a moment. A few things became clear. 

She was a woman. 

She was naked. 

And she was black. 

Mandy put together the pieces in her head just as the steam cleared, so when Vanessa's identity was revealed, she was only slightly less stunned. Mandy's eyes were as wide as possible as she took in the sight in front of her. Vanessa was completely naked standing in front of her, and she was coated in water, as beads of moisture cascaded down her naked body, dripping onto the floor. Clearly, she had literally just stepped out of the shower. For the first time, the young wife was seeing her mature black boss in the buff, and despite the strangeness of the moment, Mandy couldn't help but be awed. Vanessa's black breasts were absolutely enormous, and their immense size, and seeing how perky those huge tits were sent a wave of jealousy through her. Her slippery black skin was smooth and luscious and absolutely fucking perfect and sexy. She was also impressively fit for a woman her age, and the curves she did add only added to her appeal. Vanessa had no shame as she let her subordinate see everything, including her completely shaved cunt. Vanessa was establishing her superiority over the young wife, showing that even though Mandy had the advantage of youth, Vanessa had advantages literally everywhere else. 

"Hey, honey! You're finally awake!" Vanessa said with a bright smile, pulling on a slim, silky gold robe, and despite the fact that she was still sopping wet, that didn't stop her from draping it over her shoulders. She left the front of the robe open, proudly showing off naked pussy and her massive, bulging breasts, which literally burst out from beneath her garment, ensuring that her hot black body would be gleefully exposed to the young white wife. 

"What's going on?" Mandy croaked out, the back of her legs hitting against a chair behind her. "Why are you naked?" 

"I think you know why," Vanessa purred, her plump lips curled into a coy smile. Circling around a loveseat, still dripping water, Vanessa sat down, crossing her legs and resting her arms on the armrests, looking like a queen on her throne. 

Despite everything she knew about Zack and Vanessa, there was only one possible conclusion she could come to. And it couldn't be true. It couldn't. 

"Did you...?" Mandy asked, her eyes welling with tears. 

"I had sex with your husband last night," Vanessa boasted proudly, smiling at the young wife. Her worst fears confirmed, Mandy fell to a seated position on the chair behind her as she burst into tears. She brought her hands to her face and began to sob. Despite the fact she had just spent the evening romping in the marital suite with her secretary's new husband, her heart went out to the sobbing young bride. "Oh, honey, don't cry..." she said, reaching out to rub her knee. Mandy reacted immediately, slapping her boss's hand away. 

"What the fuck are you doing?" Mandy lashed out rightly. "You fucked my husband!" The sympathy faded from the older black woman's face as she sat back in her chair again. 

"Oh, child... when you got tanked at your own reception in front of your new hubby, leaving him high and dry... let's just say, there was only one way last night was ending. That boy..." Vanessa said, nodding at the unconscious Zack. "That boy was getting fucked last night, whether it was from you or someone else. And luckily, it ended up being me. You simply played your way out of contention with the way you behaved last night. And hon, you really blew it, cause that boy can fuck. He had me screaming all night like a fucking slut. And I fear that after the things I did to him last night, he might have already forgotten all about his little, young white wife. He's tasted chocolate, baby, and he liked the flavor." 

"Fuck you!" Mandy lashed out through her tears. "How could you do this?" 

"Honey, you..." Vanessa began. 

"Stop calling me honey!" Mandy screamed out. "I'm not 'honey', I'm not 'child', or 'baby'," 

"Fine," Vanessa said her tone changing. "You want to be treated like an adult? Well, this here is adult shit! There are no fucking fairy tales in this life, you stupid little bitch," she said firmly, catching the young woman off guard. "It is survival of the fittest. I've been playing this game for a long time, and I know the score. The people that get ahead are the people who can fuck, in all senses of the word. And bitch, I know how to fuck! Me and your husband have that in common. As soon as we met, the sexual tension was thick. This was always gonna end with me and him having sex. The only question was when, and because of you, your wedding night was the night." As she sat in the loveseat, the water on her hot body was soaking into the material of the loveseat, but the older woman didn't care. She was perfectly comfortable, evidenced by her elevated foot bouncing side-to-side lazily. 

"What are you talking about?" Mandy shrieked. Vanessa seemed puzzled for a moment, studying the young girl. 

"I don't understand why you're so upset," Vanessa began. "I did you a favor. If your husband is willing to cheat on you on your wedding night with your own boss, there's not a chance this little marriage of yours would have lasted. Right? Even if I didn't come along, some other little slut would have shook her hot ass and her big tits in his face and got the job done. Face it, honey... you two were never a good match. I knew it from the start, but I didn't say anything. Mandy... to put it bluntly, that boy is way out of your league. He's so far above your league, he's made his way into mine. I simply saved you a few wasted years of fake marital bliss." 

Despite Mandy's anger, Vanessa's words did hit home, hitting at some of the young woman's insecurities. She hated to admit that the older woman might be right. 

"I know it stings that your husband hooked up with your boss. I mean, I'm almost double your age, I was your maid of honor, and I'm black. You certainly didn't see it coming, I get it. I know it stings that a woman who barely knows your husband, a woman who barely knows him, has had better sex with him than you ever could. I know it stings that, on your wedding night, he decided he'd rather have sex with me instead, and not you. He decided that he should treat me to a dozen orgasms, while you were passed out in the next room like a damn fool. I know it hurts that your soul-mate fucked another woman and filled her up with cum, and yes, dear, your husband fucked me bareback, and he filled my tight cunt with his thick fucking sperm. And hon, it was divine! That fucking cock was like a fucking geyser of cum, my goodness! I think he was saving all of that for you, dear, but in the end, well... he decided to give it all to me. Well... not quite all of it," she said with a smirk Mandy's jaw was quivering as she tried to stay in control of her emotions, but it was a struggle. As she saw her subordinate in such a fragile state, despite knowing it was herself who made her this way, she decided to give the young woman some sage wisdom. 

"Mandy... I've been married four times." Vanessa began with a warm smile. "I know you think this is the end of the world, but believe me when I say that these things make you stronger. He's just a guy. Sure, he's a devilishly sexy guy who is deliciously fuckable. And yes, it will hurt knowing you had that hunk of man all to yourself and let him slip through your fingers. But like I said, to you, he's just a guy." 

"If he's 'just a guy', then why did you do this? Why did you... why did you have sex with him?" Mandy asked, seeking answers but struggling to say the words. 

"Honey, guys like him will always be temporary for girls like you. You might be pissed at him, and you probably see him as a cheating asshole, but don't get me wrong, he's not 'just a guy' for me. That white boy is too delicious to let pass by, and I intend to keep him. You don't have a chance with a top-tier stud like him, only women like me do. At the end of the day, you just need to move on and not think about how close you came to a perfect life, because it will only hurt you. And while you're doing that, I'll be riding his fat white cock and having his babies, having the life you could have had with your soul-mate." Vanessa said with a smug smile, her hard nipples throbbing. 7 

===

Mandy looked at her boss, a women she used to like and respect. But now, she didn't recognize her. She didn't know people could be this cruel. 

This was Vanessa raw. This was Vanessa unleashed. Her at her most callous and cold. This was what so many romantic and business rivals experienced firsthand, seeing the aggressive side of her that took what she wanted, damn the consequences. 

For years, she had held herself back in all ways, both in the boardroom and the bedroom. Sure, she had always shown men a good time, but she had restrained herself for the sake of decorum, not knowing if any of her ex-husbands, or the upper class wealthy men she had hooked up with would be able to handle the real her. If they experienced the true her, if she let the crazed, lust filled, demoness inside her rise to the surface, she feared they wouldn't have the nerve to stick around. 

She had only fully cut loose during those illicit college encounters with young white studs. It was only then that she felt comfortable enough to let her true urges rise to the surface, because she knew those white boys could handle it. They could see her fully cut loose, exposing the real her, and they would love it. Those white boys always embraced being completely and utterly fucked into submission by the demoness inside her. When she was actively on the hunt for white dick, she was as cutthroat as they came, forcefully taking who she wanted, because she knew those white boys loved being hunted. The fun lasted for a while, until her illicit affairs were discovered by her friends. This was a heavy dose of reality hitting her and facing becoming an outcast among her social circle, she knew she had to change her ways, despite her true needs. Ever since then, knowing the path she was heading towards was getting her in trouble, she knew she had to keep that side of her buried deep. She had to bury the demoness, keep it at bay. It wasn't easy, and that level of suppression of her true needs is probably what indirectly led to her success in the business world. 

Because that passion needed to be vented somewhere, and it came in the boardroom. Her cutthroat bitchiness and dogged determination led to her meteoric rise within the company as she conquered her new targets, this time rivals in the world of business. She had success after success at work, and as time went on, her urges and true nature eventually got buried so deep that her once cutthroat nature had softened. It was only now, after experiencing some big white cock again, that she was letting the demoness rise to the surface once more. She was unrepressed. Her body was coursing with energy. She was loving it! She had forsaken her young secretary, pushing her aside like a truly evil bitch! Fucking another woman's man, stealing him from her on her own wedding day. God, it was so wrong, but so hot! She should feel bad, but she didn't. The fat white dick felt way too fucking good to feel anything close to regret. No, she was elated. The demoness was happy. There was no regret. This is what she needed, and anyone who got in between her and the fat white cock she needed would face her full fury. Anyone who got in her way would be fucking destroyed. She had full access to white dick, and she would never give it up again. 

"But we're getting away from my point, baby," Vanessa began. "Like I was saying, men, no matter how good they seem, and how perfect they might seem, they will always want more. They will always want a girl with bigger tits. A rounder, juicier ass. A tighter, nastier cunt. You can't let them still control you even though they've left you behind. Luckily for me, I was blessed with a lot of gifts, and even for me, it wasn't always easy. It used to hurt for me, too," she told the young woman pointedly. "These things, these tragedies... they might hurt for a while, but they make you tougher. You get thicker skin. Mandy, it might not seem like it now, but this might be the best thing for you." 

"Fuck you, Vanessa!" Mandy replied, causing Vanessa to smile. 

"You see, that right there, that's what I'm talking about. I've always said you had a fire in you. And you can't let anyone take that from you, cause once it's out, you can't get it back. If you let the bad stuff control you, your fire gets extinguished. Don't let him take it away from you, and don't let me take it either. You've had many setbacks in life, and so have I. I've dealt with shitty husbands, prejudices at work. Yet here I sit, on top of the world, the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, with a new man, and more money than I will ever need. I wouldn't be here if those obstacles hadn't been there. So even though this might seem like the worst moment in your life, if you don't let that fire go out, you can do some amazing things." 

"I don't care, Vanessa." Mandy said, shaking her head, her tear ducts empty. "I don't want another one of your fucking lessons. You fucked my husband, you fucking twisted bitch." Vanessa smiled and nodded, loving hearing the young woman fight back. 

"You see baby, you're proving my point. You're standing up to me, something you used to be petrified of doing. This is... this is why I have to finish the job. This is why I have to destroy you. It's for the best," Vanessa stated, her tone warm but intimidating. Mandy had never fully experienced seeing her boss like this in the boardroom, the evil side of her she had heard rumors about. For the first time, she was seeing that side of her, the side that tore apart smaller companies because she could, or conquered rivals to establish her dominance. "Hon, I have to take it all from you. I already talked to my lawyer, and got the ball rolling on the divorce papers. I mean, he ain't coming back to you after last night. And, I'm guessing you probably don't want to keep working for me, since I, you know, just stole your husband, so I've already fired you. And, just to rub it in, by the time you start looking for work elsewhere, you're gonna find yourself black-balled from just about any reputable company in the city. At this point, I might as well just ruin your fucking future... just because I can." Mandy listened, hearing her future being demolished by her naked black boss. 

"Mandy, you will never be lower than you are now," the older woman began after a long pause, letting her previous statement sink in. "And I know you want revenge on me. You want to make me pay, I get it. You probably want to slap me in the face, or maybe more. I don't recommend it, unless you want me to kick your ass after all the other things I've done to you. But when you walk out that door in a few minutes, there is a very small chance I will ever see you again. Quite frankly, I've fucking owned you, and kicked you down back to the bottom. And if you want that revenge on me, I want you to earn it. I want that fire to blaze inside you. I want that drive for vengeance to stop you from wallowing in self-pity. I want you to overcome all the obstacles I've put in front of you. I want to make you a stronger woman, Mandy. That's all I've ever wanted from you. So, when you and I meet again, down the road, when you're sitting across a boardroom table from me, we can have it out, once and for all, as equals. As peers. So you see, honey, I'm just trying to make a strong woman out of you." 

Vanessa let these words sink in her secretary's mind for a few moments. She didn't feel the least bit of shame or regret at destroying this young woman's life. She had to learn that sex is a warzone, and if women like her didn't evolve, they would always end up on the losing side. Vanessa was a winner in life, and winners get rewarded. She had played nice for too long and that generosity had just been rewarded, bringing a perfect fucking white stud on her radar, a gift from fate that had led her to unimagined pleasure, pleasure she deserved. 

"It's funny," Vanessa began with a smirk. "If you had just handled your business with the wedding, and not let me get involved... none of this would have happened. You would be the one glowing after a long wedding night of amazing sex. You made one little mistake and let me get involved, and now... you've lost everything you've worked for. I want you to think about that..." Vanessa said, looking down at the young woman. 

She looked into her eyes, looking to see if the fire was still there, or if her work of the last day had truly destroyed her. To be honest, she wasn't sure what the answer was, but at the moment, it didn't really matter. Vanessa had more important work to do. 

"Okay, bitch," Vanessa began, standing up, clapping her hands loudly. Despite her furious anger at her now former boss, Mandy's eyes couldn't help but watch the older woman's massive black breasts bounce and jiggle as she rose. Standing proudly, standing over the young woman like an Amazon queen, she gave her next command. "Now... get the fuck out of my suite. Me and your hubby have a busy day in front of us, and I need my morning fuck before we go. So get up and get the fuck out." 

Not knowing what else to do, Mandy obeyed, rising to her feet. Realizing her current state, she asked for a bit of mercy. 

"Can I at least change before I go?" Mandy asked, defeated. 

"Naw, bitch. You need to go right now. I want you to walk through the city in that ratty dress. I want that memory to burn inside for the rest of your life." Vanessa replied forcefully, pushing her secretary towards the door. Mandy was at least able to grab her purse. As she reached the doorway, she took one last look back at her still sleeping husband, not knowing if she would ever see the man she loved again. But before she knew it, she was in the hotel hallway, the door to her wedding suite shutting behind her. She was standing alone, in her wrinkled wedding dress, and her husband was locked away from her, seemingly lost in a whole new world. 

Mandy started to cry again. 

************* 

For Zack, as he was seated in a first class seat of a fancy, luxury jet, it felt like he had woken up in a whole new world. He remembered everything from the night before. Everything. He was still in disbelief at what he had taken part in the night before, and despite his actions, he did feel some regret for betraying his wife. He still loved her, but what he had been talked into the night before had shown him that he couldn't change his stripes. He wasn't built for a girl like Mandy. He just couldn't do it. 

In a sense it didn't even feel like it was up to him. This crazy stuff had just happened to him, and he had just been caught in the wave. He had been pushed along into this new world kicking and screaming, and now in this one moment of peace and silence, he didn't know if he should just keep going or run away. But this would only last a moment, as Vanessa emerged, reappearing after talking to one of the stewardesses, moving to sit next to him, making sure any escape had to go through her. 

She was so different than the woman he expected to be travelling with, Mandy. Firstly, she was black. And much older than him. She was way more confident and controlling. She was far more voluptuous, with those massive black tits and that amazing round ass. Seated next to him, she exuded sex in a way that his wife never could hope to. She looked amazing, wearing a tight, red button-up blouse, showing off a good amount of tightly compacted cleavage, and a tight brown leather skirt, going down to her knees. 

She looked at him knowingly. He was at once both terrified of her and intimidated by her, but deeply turned on in a way he never had felt before. Those eyes displayed a lazy confidence in her control of him. She knew she had him by the balls, and despite his reluctance, she had control over him. He was in her thrall, now. 

He didn't know if he was making a really fucked up mistake, or if he had been corrupted beyond reprieve, or simply living out a destiny that was preordained. He didn't know if he was ready for this new world he was entering or even if he was meant for it. 

But as he was about to realize, it wasn't really up to him. There would be no escape. 

As the flight was preparing for takeoff, Vanessa saw an opportunity to fool around a bit. She moved her lips to his and forced a kiss onto him, sliding her thick tongue into his married mouth as their lips smacked together. Zack simply slid into the moment, getting caught up in the lust easily with little hesitance. His hands slid to her chest, feeling up her massive black tits, as her hand moved to his crotch feeling his bulging cock. They had already fucked once this morning, a rough, intense bit of sex which ended with them both soaked with sweat and clutched tight together as he came inside her again. And if they weren't interrupted with a pointed throat-clear by one of the stewardesses, they probably would have gotten down to business again right here in front of everyone. 

Zack would often feel doubts early on in this new affair, but it never really stopped him from actively participating. Once she exerted her sexual will on him, those doubts would be forgotten, and the true Zack would emerge. The sexual lion, the animalistic stud. By the time his honeymoon trip with his wife's boss was over, all of those doubts would be fucked out of him. By the time Vanessa bought him home to her place, he was her fully compliant, willing, and eager boy-toy. 

The honeymoon was just the beginning of Zack's new life. The resort was seemingly built for the truly elite. He was treated to amazing food, amazing locales, beautiful people, everything was just... incredible. It was truly a whole other world. Vanessa was his guide to this new life he found himself in, this life of luxury that he was being introduced to. She wore him on her arm proudly, showing off her new lover to all the other envious women. She was his tour guide in a tiny, baby blue thong bikini, showing off her juicy black body without shame, and that was enough for him to eagerly follow. Zack would find himself gawking at her massive, jiggling breasts, and her large, round juicy ass. Seeing her dressed so filthy really worked him up. They would literally fuck for hours in the honeymoon suite every day. After a few days of this, he couldn't help but admit that she was without question the sexiest creature he had ever laid eyes on, and he couldn't imagine how it would be possible to have better sex. 

From what Vanessa said, the other people at this resort area were like her, mainly those among the elite, like her, the hyper-rich. All of them no doubt knew what these two were up to, and they no doubt heard them in action. But there was no judgment. They were among equals. The other men here looked confident, and the women here were insanely beautiful and insanely voluptuous. It felt strange to parade around as the older black woman's young white boy- toy, but he felt no judgment from them. Only respect and acceptance. After a while of this, he started to feel like he belonged among them. 

Vanessa was aware of his dreams and ambitions of acting, and among the elite at this resort she introduced him to a few people in the business, getting his name out there. She then introduced him to one of her friends, a woman Zack recognized. She was the host of some trashy daytime talk show, lacking the legitimacy of a show like Naomi's. Zack had never really watched her show, as it seemed too crude and gossipy for his tastes. So it wasn't until this moment he realized how voluptuous and sexy she was. She was black, like Vanessa, although she had lighter skin. She also had died her hair so it was colored a dirty blonde, which really stood out for a woman with her complexion. She wasn't quite as fit as Vanessa, but her body had curves in all the right places. She was very sexy. If he had known this before, he would have been an avid viewer, just to catch a glimpse at her voluptuous body being so flagrantly shown off. She was probably about the same age as Vanessa, but she was far less mature and composed than Vanessa, telling loud stories, cursing every other word. But Zack didn't have much to add as the two older women talked, both eyeing him lustily. Zack admired the woman's bulging, caramel-colored breasts in her bikini top, and even though she was wearing a sarong around her lower half, the matching thong she wore beneath it was quite visible. 

Zack was so lost in his thoughts that he didn't realize he had stopped listening until both women were looking at him. Perking up his ears, he listened as Vanessa repeated herself. 

"I said, me and her have been looking to do some work together for quite some time, and that you might be able to help us out with that," Vanessa stated to her young lover. There was a heated pause at the table, before her friend laughed loudly. 

"I think we scared the poor boy," her friend stated. She leaned in close, her massive knockers hanging below her. "What she's asking, hon, is if you want to fuck two black women tonight?" she asked, raising one of her perfectly styled eyebrows. 

So, Zack fucked two black women that night. 

The threesome with them was incredible, an even more thrilling experience than any he had before, except maybe his wedding night. Having sex with both Vanessa and her friend, feeling all that sexy black skin against him, feeling two pairs of huge black breasts, fucking two amazing black pussies, splitting open two juicy black asses, and in the process fucking two women who were almost double his age... it was as amazing as it sounded. The two women were as energized and lusty towards him as he was to them. 

This was the beginning of a new aspect of his life with Vanessa. She had been eager to lock him down and put a ring on his finger to make their affair official, which she did quite quickly after returning home, but she was also very happy to share him with other women. And it was usually black women. Zack couldn't even count how many black women he had fucked at Vanessa's urging. And it was a wide range of women as well. Athletes. Singers. Other businesswomen. Vanessa would ask them to meet for a professional dinner, or they would meet at a charity event, or something along those lines. It even happened a lot at some church events Vanessa took him to, with one of the shockingly attractive and busty nuns introducing them to other powerful women. 

These type of encounters happened all the time, and by the end, it would always end with nasty, filthy sex, with Zack as the centerpiece of the threesome. Threesomes that almost always end the same, with Vanessa on top, showing her superiority to both her young white husband and their new acquaintance. Vanessa was a Queen Slut, and these threesomes allowed these new friends to come under her thrall. For the young women, they gained a new mentor and idol. For older women, Vanessa's contemporaries, they began to see her as a true peer. 

But it didn't even stop there. Vanessa had become acquainted with another older black woman, a female senator. While this woman was well-known as someone who seemed very tightly-wound and conservative, Zack soon discovered how crazy filthy she truly was. Yeah, Zack fucked her too, at Vanessa's urging. In doing so, her and Vanessa became as thick as thieves, and whenever Zack would see the senator giving some fiery, blistering speech on the floor of the senate, supporting some issue Zack vehemently disagreed with, Zack would remember how good her ass looked in that purple thong, and all his political concerns would just sort of slip away. 

But maybe the most surreal encounter of all was when Zack and Vanessa met up with Naomi, the billionaire TV host and mogul who he had met at his wedding. Zack knew how the night would end as soon as they met up for dinner, but even when it happened, when Zack had a threesome with Vanessa and Naomi, when he found himself smothered in their dark, smooth flesh, when he fell asleep with two powerful black women pressed into him, he couldn't help but marvel at this new life he was living. 8 

===

Zack was starting to really realize there was a whole new world of women out there that he had never been aware of. Powerful black women, who craved hard white cock above anything else, and would do anything to spread the wealth. Zack had fucked SO many black women by this point, and each one of those encounters had been more thrilling and hot than any of the sexual encounters in his old life. To put it frankly, in his experience it became clear to him that black women were far better at sex than white girls. He associated them with good sex, and he would get hard whenever he saw an attractive black woman. 

But he wasn't completely done with white women just yet. 

***************** 

Zack was surprised at how supportive Vanessa was towards his dreams of acting, even though if his dreams succeeded, that would seemingly mean more time away from him her new husband. But Vanessa was happy to make a few calls, until finally, she let him know that she knew a pretty well known and highly regarded casting agent. 

"I know this bitch. She's good, but her price is steep," Vanessa explained after another bout of rough sex, curling up against her man. "You're gonna have to sling some dick her way, though. Now I'm warning you, she is white, so you're gonna have to work extra hard to get it up for her. But trust me, she's a babe, and she's the cutthroat bitch you need to get places. And she has really big tits, so... I'll think you like her." 

So that was how Zack found himself sitting in a casting office, dressed comfortably but stylishly, waiting for the casting agent to appear. His back was to the door as he sat in front of the desk. He was more nervous than he had been in a while, which probably explained why he didn't hear the door open behind him. 

"I've never been one for destiny, Zack..." a voice said behind him. When he heard it, a chill of recognition went down his spine. "You've spent so long denying me, turning me down." From behind Zack emerged Megan, that woman that always came into the bar to flirt with him. Here, she was dressed in a professional, but sexy, business suit, highlighting her impressive figure. "So, the fact that you come strolling in here, in my office, in need of my help... it feels like fate, doesn't it? It feels like fate has a plan for us?" she asked, sitting down across the desk, a smile on her face. 

"You're a casting agent?" Zack asked in disbelief, unable to comprehend that the woman who flirted with him so brazenly could actually be a professional woman. 

"Probably the best in the city," she replied, undoing her suit coat, exposing her dark blue blouse. "I didn't know you were an actor," 

"Well, uh, I haven't gotten much in the way of parts," Zack replied. 

"If you sign up with me, I'll make you a star! Trust me." she boasted. "I can make you or break you Zack. Believe it or not, I have a lot of clout in this city. I have a steep price, but it's SO worth it." 

"What will it cost?" Zack asked, knowing the answer, and knowing that he would end up losing a battle of wills to this woman that they had been taking part in for months. 

She stood up and walked around the desk, leaning her butt against the edge of the desk in front of him. She bent over the armrest of the chair, her big boobs hanging down, her top slightly open, showing a hint of smooth cleavage. 

"I could really go for that drink, Zack," she said, with a hinting smirk. 

A few hours later, after an intense bout of steamy, sweaty sex, both Zack and Megan were on their backs, panting. Megan, her mammoth breasts rising and falling with every breath, turned to him, wiping the semen off her lips and said to him, in awe, "I knew it. The wait was SO worth it." 

Zack agreed. 

A few days later, Megan came over to Vanessa's apartment to hammer out the details. Being the skilled negotiator she was, Zack let Vanessa handle the specifics. And, this was really the moment where Zack truly knew he was in a new level in life, a crazier one, where the same rules don't apply. 

"My services are steep, and Zack, well... he's a special case," Megan explained firmly. "To put it bluntly, I want what you got," Megan said, gesturing at Vanessa's four month pregnant belly. 

"You want a baby?" Vanessa asked, amused. 

"You want to be a star? I want your babies!" Megan said to Zack. "Three of them. Plus... 50% over my current fee. Minimum." 

"I could easily find another agent," Vanessa replied. 

"I have a lot of clout, Vanessa," Megan stated firmly, unafraid. "You clearly have reasons for wanting him to succeed, and it's clearly not the money," she said pointedly. "You want this to happen, and if you turn me down, he will never get work in this city. So, I repeat, three babies, and 50% over my current rate." 

A silence hung between them as Vanessa looked her down, appraising her. Her lips curled up in a bemused smile. 

"I'll give you 75% above your current rate, and two babies," Vanessa offered. Zack was stunned. These women were negotiating breeding rights for his apparently prized seed. What kind of craziness was this? 

"I can take that deal," Megan relented. 

"So it is!" Vanessa agreed, shaking the younger white woman's hand. "75% and two babies." She had just made a deal which allowed her husband to impregnate another woman as payment. What was this madness? 

"I can't wait," Megan replied, before giving a lusty look to a baffled Zack. 

So, this was how Zack entered the acting world, his dream profession. For as long as he looked down at Megan, it became clear that she knew what she was talking about in the casting world, and these were lessons Zack wouldn't have been able to listen to months prior. 

"Honestly, Zack," Megan told him, as they met at a bar for drinks to discuss his future. "Acting is like sex. Directors don't want the boring, noble guy who is nice, responsible, and goes home to make love to his nice, boring little wife. They want a guy with sex appeal. With edge. They don't want boring, dull stars. They want bright stars. They want sexiness. They want a guy that women will respond to. They want to cast the guy that women fantasize about when they have sex with their boyfriend or husband. They want to cast the guy with charm, who does the little things that can make a girl melt. So, what I'm telling you, Zack, is to embrace your sex appeal. Don't run from it. You're fucking sexy, Zack. You know how to flirt. You know how to charm. Do that. Embrace that. And I guarantee that directors will be throwing parts at you, just as fast as women will be throwing their thongs." 

As crazy as it sounded... she was right. With Megan putting him together with directors, and him returning to his old ways, embracing his inner player, he started landing parts. Small parts at first, but once they saw his chemistry with some of the actresses, those small parts became bigger, and his appeal began to grow. 

Vanessa encouraged and fostered this success. Zack wondered if this was because his increased name recognition made her all the more proud to have him locked down. Whatever the reason, she was more than willing to let him pursue these parts. Even though this was his own work, she made it a point to be active in this part of his life as much as she could. As Zack worked, Vanessa would hobnob with these Hollywood muckity-mucks. 

Zack landed more prominent roles, and started working with more famous actresses. Based on his innate sexual chemistry with these actresses, especially the black actresses, Zack was allowed to work more and more, with bigger stars. For a while, he would be the one white guy in mostly black movies, but his star power soon rose beyond these small roles. He eventually got a part in a movie with the famous black actress who actually came to his wedding as one of Vanessa's guests, where they had met briefly. The sexual heat and chemistry between them was obvious, even though that was not the intent of their parts. Even knowing he was with Vanessa, and that she was rumored to be in an on-again off-again thing with a famous basketball player, all the workers on set speculated whether Zack and the actress were having sex. Zack felt the heat between them as well, and asked Vanessa what he should do. Vanessa's answer was clear. 

"Tap that ass, baby," she commanded of him proudly. 

So... Zack tapped that ass. Him and this young, hot, busty black starlet hooked up nearly every day after that, at least until the movie was done filming, and many, many times afterward. They didn't mind being stuck waiting in their trailers, and when the directors eventually came knocking, the trailer would almost always be rocking. 

While Vanessa had merely been minor acquaintances with this actress at the time of Zack's wedding, Zack's new affair gave the older black woman an in to establish a close relationship with her. They had many things in common to talk about, as both were successful black women, and also lovers of Zack's, and, through this quick friendship, and the occasional threesome with him, they became almost like sisters. Her friendship with this burgeoning star gave Vanessa an in on a lot of juicy Hollywood gossip, behind the scenes stuff. Vanessa had now gained true Hollywood access, extending her reach into another all new realm. 

But despite the fact that Zack was having a lot of sex with a lot of women as his star power rose, it always came back to Vanessa. She was his main lover, and everything he did was at her behest. She was still the best in terms of sex, and they fucked all the time. He was right in his initial assessment of her. She could never be out fucked. It was impossible to wear her down. Her appetite for filth was unmatched. She would just keep going, until you just had no choice but to accept your place beneath her and let her do her worst to you, let her fuck you into submission. Her pleasure was what mattered, and being the one to be able to provide that to her was incredible. The sex... the submission... it was just intoxicating. Being with her felt like being in the presence of a goddess. He fucking worshipped her hot black body. He gave her everything she asked of him, just for access to that hot black body of hers. Plus, she was already pregnant with their first baby, with the emphasis on first, as she made it clear this would be the first of many, many babies they would have together. She was hot fire, and after everything she had shown him, she fucking owned his thick white cock. 

Zack didn't fully understand why she was so willing to let him fuck other women. Sure, it was fun, and it kept things interesting, but he thought she would be super possessive of him. 

But Vanessa had a plan. 

For so long, she had been bored. In her mind, she had conquered the world of business, and she wanted more. She wanted even greater success. She wanted to use her position of power as a stepping stone to ascend to the next level. She was very happy whenever she encountered another woman in a power position, especially black women, but it seemed like the women she did know, like Naomi, and her friend the senator, were on a level above her own, a level she wanted to join. It was an uncommon sight for her, and Vanessa always believed that women like her needed to stick together, but she couldn't find her way in. 

Then Zack's big white cock came along, and changed everything. 

He was her in, allowing her to deepen her friendships with these women, forged on the crucible of hot interracial sex. Vanessa was gaining close friendships with as many black women in power as she could find. Naomi, the senator, her young actress friend, the talk show host, that was just the beginning. Vanessa was creating a bond with all these women with power, a sisterhood of powerful black women, with her as the central figure. Vanessa was fixing to be a prominent woman in the future of the world she lived in, the beautiful, the powerful, the elite. 

It certainly helped that she had some help. She had hired a new assistant to replace Mandy, that bitch Trina from the banquet hall. And unlike Mandy, she could let Trina in on her true intentions and desires. Unlike Mandy, Trina knew the score. She was in the game, she understood what Vanessa wanted and she understood her methods. Plus, she was a cutthroat, kinky little bitch, and having someone like that as your assistant was very useful. She was often deployed as a hot little sex-bomb to help sweeten business deals, and plus, she got a regular dose of Zack, so she was happy to play her part in Vanessa's success. 

Vanessa was firing on all cylinders to kick start her rise to the elite, and thanks to Zack, her plan was coming along quite nicely. 

As his star-power grew, more eyes were on him. More women were getting turned on by his obvious sex appeal. To powerful women, his type of appeal was like catnip. Phone calls were made, dinners were had, sex ensued. And each time this happened, Vanessa forged another strong bond with another major figure. Vanessa's future was quickly looking bright. 

It was only these women, these truly powerful women, whose approval she sought. She didn't want them to be her superiors. She wanted to be among them. She wanted them to be her peers. She wanted their respect. For so long, she had sought their approval and friendship through traditional ways, but it never really amounted to anything. But, as it turns out, like with most things, sex was the key. Sex was her way in. Turns out all she needed was some fat, white dick, and having complete control of a handsome white stud who loved to fuck black women proved to be very, very useful. Vanessa had threesomes with these other women, sharing her new husband Zack with them. Vanessa had had many threesomes since getting married to her new man, and even with most of the other women of significant status, Vanessa had risen to the top during the threesome, truly being the alpha bitch. But it was only with these truly powerful black women where she felt like she was among peers. And it was the soft nod of respect from Naomi as she rode Vanessa's husband's dick, or the significant cloak-and-dagger efforts her senator friend made to sneak off for another heated threesome with Vanessa and Zack... it was these things that let her know she had finally joined the elite. Vanessa saw these other women in their intimate moments, saw behind the veil, saw what these women were truly like, how they lived, and how they fucked, crucial details of any female friendship. Once she had her foot in the door, Vanessa learned all she could from these women, the masters. These women were showing her this new world, and Vanessa quickly felt as if she belonged. She had new connections. Unencumbered access. The juicy secrets of the world of the hyper-elite. She had finally ascended to this new world after years of trying, and she had some BIG plans. 

But honestly, all of that was secondary, a happy twist of fate that rose out of what was really most important to her, the same thing that mattered most to other powerful women: hot sex. She had a prime-cut white stud enter her life, and after a few hours in his presence, his incredible appeal had driven her crazy with lust. She had tried to deny her need for him, but he was so Goddamn hot, she just couldn't help herself. She snapped him up and pushed his wife out of the way brutally, doing some bad things in the process, all in the name of hot sex. 

And the sex was scorching. 

God, the sex she and Zack had was good at the start, and it had only gotten better. They fucked the living daylights out of each other on a daily basis, the young white man nearly matching her own insane appetite for pure filth. She had never felt THIS sex-crazed, but Zack brought it out in her. She had never been as attracted to any of her other husbands as she was to Zack, and she just knew this marriage was built to last. The sex was that good! She had to lock that shit down, no doubt, and she had. Vanessa just knew her and her young white husband were going to be together for a long, long time. They were an amazing couple. 

Everything about him just did it for her. His handsome face. His hot body. That big, fat white cock. Even his manly scent was enough to make her nipples hard. Thoughts of him and the things he could do to her would never fail to make her dripping wet. The sex was so good, so raw and animalistic, that it almost became a point of pride for her to share her new man with other women, just to show them what she was getting every night and make them super envious. To show them the type of lusty, vigorous fucking she got every night, and showing her peers what she was capable of in the bedroom. That's what initially spurred her to share her new man, something she had never once considered before with any of her previous lovers. It was based on pride. It was only after seeing him in action with other women, seeing how he affected other women in the same way he affected her... it was only then when a plan began to formulate. 

It was her cunning mind that used this desire as a way to network, sharing her new husband with other powerful women as a way to get ahead. She wanted to scream from the rooftops how fucking amazing her sex-life currently was, and this seemed like the next best thing. She got to take part in lots of hot, crazy fucking. And if this filthy sex just happened to raise her social status, she wouldn't complain. 

Zack certainly didn't mind playing his part in her journey. The sex was too good. He didn't fully understand her willingness to share, but being able to have so much incredible sex with so many amazing sexy black women... needless to say, he wasn't complaining. 

So, this was Zack's new life. He lived enthralled by his dominant, older black lover, who was now his new wife, fucking her brains out, giving her babies, and using his cock to establish relationships with other powerful, sexy black women. And thanks to Vanessa, and her powerful connections, he was living his dream of acting, a job that gave him creative and artistic fulfillment. He literally had it all. He had true fulfillment. 

And it was all thanks to cheating on his wife. 

Zack had long sought some sort of fulfillment in life, something deeper than what those slutty girls he used to hook up with could provide. He felt like he needed something more than a hot, round ass and a pair of big tits. This was why he sought out Mandy, a girl who's character and substance more than made up for what her bra cups lacked. She challenged him, and stimulated him on an emotional and personal level. He thought that was what he needed. 

He was wrong. 

Sure, the things that Mandy offered him were nice, but they weren't what Zack really needed. He thought what he truly required was that emotional fulfillment, but he was wrong. There were things that ended up being more important to him. In fact, in the end, it was big breasts and hot asses that mattered the most to him. It ended up being that those girls from before, those young sluts he used to hook up with, who he thought were the pinnacle of hotness at the time, just didn't have enough in those areas. Zack just needed their asses to be rounder and juicier. He just needed their already impressively huge tits to be even bigger. And, as it turns out, he needed a woman who was 20 years his senior, and most importantly, he needed her to be black. He needed a woman like that to fuck his brains out, to fuck him into complete submission. He needed to be taught to embrace his sex appeal, and stop denying his true nature. And then, and only then, would he find contentment and fulfillment. He would finally be in the place he belonged. 

Needless to say, Zack had found true satisfaction. 

And thanks to the fact that he was almost drowning in black pussy, smothered constantly between huge black tits, or juicy black asses, Zack never looked back at his old life. 9

He rarely ever thought about Mandy anymore. 

**************** 

Life had not gone as well for Mandy. Losing her man, and her job, and the humiliating things that had happened due to those things, it led to a deep depression. She was sad, heartbroken, and humiliated by what happened on her wedding night. She couldn't stop thinking about it, and it always filled her with burning anger and deep shame. She had never felt lower, and the fire inside her was practically extinguished. 

She had to restart her life professionally as well, just so she wouldn't go crazy thinking about things. True to her word, Vanessa had indeed blackballed her from a lot of the major businesses in the city. She eventually found work in retail, just to sustain her as she figured out how to proceed and rebuild. As mind-numbing as retail work was, it was enough to get by. This drive to rebuild dominated her thoughts, almost allowing her to forget about what happened with Vanessa and Zack. 

Then the wedding gift arrived. 

A mystery gift arrived at her door, wrapped neatly in wrapping paper. Mandy was confused, wondering if there was someone out there who hadn't gotten the memo. Unsure, she eventually relented and indulged her curiosity, opening up the gift. 

She was a little confused to find one of those digital picture frames inside. Opening it up, she checked it out before plugging it in. Once she did, it became apparent there were pictures already loaded to it. And as she eyes hit the pictures that lit up the screen, her heart sank, and her questions were answered. 

She was seeing pictures of Vanessa. 

It was a slideshow, pictures clearly from the wedding photographer and the first picture showed the wedding party, showing Mandy flanked by Zack and Vanessa, Vanessa smirking slightly, her big fucking tits shoved outwards like the fucking whore she was. 

As the slideshow went on, Mandy retreated to the background as the pictures focused on Vanessa and Zack. Those two dancing, Vanessa's big old tits pushed up against Zack. It showed Vanessa sitting on his lap, his eyes lodged on her valley of her cleavage, while Mandy looked like a mess next to them. It was like a shrine to those two, really emphasizing that those two were the stars of the wedding. Those two were the happy couple. Those two would be the ones who would fuck. 

In the next picture, they were both naked. 

The style of the pictures went from the professional quality done by the photographer to candid shots done in moments of heated passion. Some shots were done by Vanessa, showing herself riding Zack in the wedding suite. But then there were pictures taken from afar, showing a naked Vanessa from behind, her juicy ass facing the camera as she rode Zack's dick like a bucking bronco. There was a picture from the side of the bed of Zack and Vanessa on the bed locked in each other's arms, rolling around the mattress as they furiously made out. 

But as the slideshow went on, it became clear the party that night got even crazier. 

A picture from the front, showing Vanessa on all fours, her massive black udders hanging down, with Zack behind her, hands on her big ass as he fucked her from behind. Vanessa wore a wicked smile as she smiled at the camera. 

A picture of Zack, standing on the bed, spraying down Vanessa's big black tits with a huge load of thick, white cum. 

A picture of some new woman, a woman who looked like she worked at the hotel, taking a smiling selfie as she licked a thick line of cum off of one of Vanessa's huge, smooth black breasts. Some of the cum that was coating Vanessa had smeared onto the hotel woman's blazer. A big glob of Mandy's husband's cum had landed on the woman's nametag, obscuring the end of the name, but it appeared to be Kait, or maybe Kaitlyn. 

A picture of the hotel woman getting fucked in her work uniform, her mouth agape as Zack drilled her, his bare, flexed ass visible in the picture. Behind them, Vanessa guzzling an expensive bottle of champagne. 

The next picture showed Zack and the hotel woman on the balcony, fucking as they overlooked the city, Vanessa standing next to them, facing the camera as she took the picture. As Zack fucked the hotel woman from behind, Vanessa was pouring the thousand dollar champagne over her massive tits and Zack's mouth was locked on her throbbing nipple, gathering her heated sweat and expensive champagne onto his tongue. 

Another picture showed them back in the room. Vanessa was taking the camera as she held Zack's mouth to her chest, feeding her nipple to him like a baby. Behind them, sitting back, watching the action with her big tits revealed and her long legs spread was the hotel woman, sipping another bottle of expensive champagne. And at the other end of the picture, a new woman, an Asian woman, her mouth swallowing Zack's thick cock down to the base. It was that bitch from the banquet hall, Trina! Where did she come from? 

The next picture showed Trina and Zack in the bathroom, fucking above Mandy's own passed out form. Vanessa and the hotel woman were at the front of the picture, mouth's open in awe as this twisted fuck occurred. 

The next picture was even more twisted. It showed Zack standing over his drunken wife, while kneeling next to her was Vanessa, on her knees. Zack was gripping her big, firm tits as he savagely slid his cock between her huge breasts, fucking the enormous black udders roughly. She assisted in this process, gripping her own tits between her thin fingers, pressing her big boobs together, smothering the turgid white rod in soft, smooth black breast-flesh. As the young white husband fucked her black tits, she looked up at him, her lips spread in an impressed smile, as if she was proud of the young married man for coming up with this illicit idea. The idea to fuck her big black tits over his passed out wife, the various combined sex-juices coating his dick and her smooth cavern of cleavage dripping onto her sleeping face. 

The next picture showed all three of the women, big breasts exposed as they took a proud picture together, cum strewn on their bodies, Zack passed out behind them. 

The next picture showed Zack passed out on the mattress, Vanessa's hot naked body curled up next to his in the wedding suite bed. 

The setting changed in the next picture, showing Zack and Vanessa on a beach, Zack looking sexy in his trunks, and Vanessa looking filthy in a tiny, baby blue bikini, her big old tits hanging out, and her naked cunt nearly exposed. The next one showed them from behind, Zack's palm gripping one of her ass cheeks as it thrust out from her miniscule thong bikini. 

The next few pictures went by in a blur. Zack meeting famous black women, looking happy. Zack fucking multiple black women, looking even happier. Some of the pictures looked downright artful, Zack on a bed in the middle, with two voluptuous older black women on either side. Some looked filthy, like seeing Zack standing behind a well-dressed older black woman, who looked familiar, like a businesswoman or a politician. Zack was behind her as she pulled up her skirt, his handsome face smothered in the older woman's big, bare, thong-clad ass. 

In some pictures, Zack looked like he was being smothered between multiple pairs of big black tits. In others, it showed raw interracial fucking, Zack driving into another mystery black woman. 

Other pictures showed off Zack's new found fame, showing him next to famous women, like that actress who was at their wedding, and Naomi, the billionaire. 

Some pictures showed just Vanessa and Zack, Vanessa on top of Zack, feeding him her hard nipple as she chewed her lip. Another picture showed Zack furiously eating the black woman's bare pussy. Another showed his face smothered in her ass. One picture was a beautiful black and white picture... of Vanessa's face coated in Zack's thick cum. 

But there was one picture that jumped out most of all. It was a picture of Vanessa and Zack, naked, in bed. Vanessa looked heavily pregnant as she rode Zack. His hands were on her huge, bulbous black tits as they fucked. But the thing that jumped out at her was the smile of absolute peace and contentment on Zack's face. He looked happy. He looked satisfied. He looked complete. 

Unable to look at this humiliation any longer, Mandy took the picture frame and slammed it against the wall. With it cracked on the floor, she stood above it and stomped on it, screaming and crying, breaking it till it was broken beyond recognition, where she could never see those pictures again. Finally she stopped, breathing heavily, eyes blazing. 

She looked in the mirror, seeing herself on edge. Seeing herself panting and angry and upset. But as she looked in the mirror, one thing was clear. 

Vanessa had been proven right. 

The fire inside Mandy... it still burned.
