 ****** Another Cheating Wife Story ****** byGotBaconÂ© I'm Eric Jensen. I'm 39 years old. I stand 6' 2" and weigh around 210 pounds. I graduates from college with a bachelors degree in both computer science and business administration. 

 I am the proud owner, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Computer Solutions. Simply, we write and sell software packages. We have packages for anyone from a Mom and Pop store to multinational corporations. My company is currently worth 3.8 million dollars and growing at a rate of about 5% per year. I hold 60% of the shares and each of our kids have 10%. I hire the best programmers, sales people and techs I can find. I pay the good ones well and have a very low turnover in personnel. 

 "I'm married to Sarah. She is the classic blue eyed blonde with a body to die for. We met in college and were married before I graduated. She graduated with a degree in basket weaving or some bullshit subject. Thankfully my parents had enough money set aside to take care of us. We have two wonderful children. Kevin is 16 years old and Amy is 17. They both are on the honor roll in school. 

 Amy inherited her mothers blonde hair and my brown eyes. Kevin got my brown hair and eyes. They are both great kids. They are active in sports and many of the social clubs on campus. I thank my lucky stars that they aren't into drugs or alcohol. I told Kevin that if he got lucky to always use a condom. I don't want some woman showing up on our doorstep with her pregnant daughter in tow. I suspect his sex life consists of a few hand jobs. He has a girlfriend but I really think she likes him because he helps her get good grades. I'll need to clue him in on gold diggers when he gets older. 

 Amy is in between boyfriends. She caught her guy in the Dairy Queen smooching it up with another girl. She walked in and slapped him across the face. He started to hit her but three guys stood up and convinced him to sit back down. After cursing them both out she walked out of his life. Kevin offered to kick his ass but Amy had him back off. 

 Sarah's favorite pastime is spending my money. Her and her two friends, Millie and Beth, excel at it. When she walks in her favorite store all the employees give her a standing ovation. When her closets get full she donates most of it to Goodwill and starts again. Don't ask how many pairs of shoes she has. The one perk of her shopping expeditions is the hot lingerie she buys. Seeing her wearing them would give a dead man a boner. She is an animal in bed with no inhibitions. She likes any way anytime. It's all I can do to keep up with her. Sometimes I wonder why the neighbors don't complain about her screaming orgasms. Both kids tease us unmercifully about it. We just smile. 

 Our sex live consist of two or three fucks during the week and one hot one on Sunday morning. Sunday morning is especially memorable as she usually has from three of four screamers and I cum so hard that I'm sure sparks fly out of my cock. 

 Then it's into the kitchen for a huge breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, toast and a huge pot of coffee. Sarah likes to cook and does most of it. She hates cleaning up and has assigned that duty to the kids. 

 We also have a maid service that comes in three days a week. I do all the yard work. It's one of my passions. We have a pool service that comes around twice a week. Of course, Sarah's swimsuits consist of enough material to make up three pin wipers. She has a hot body and knows it. She sunbathes in the nude. She has some thing in her mind against tan lines. Amy isn't quite as bad. She mostly wears a bikini or a thong now and then. 

 Sarah is especially proud of our 5 bedroom house. It has a nice mortgage on it. I just haven't gotten around to paying it off yet. Weather permitting she plans a pool party/barbecue almost every Saturday. I've become a pretty good grill man over the years. Of course, Sarah sunbathes while the kids and I clean up. 

 **************** 

 Over the last month or so, I've noticed a small change in our sex lives. Instead of two or three during the week it's tapered off to one or none. Our Sunday session hasn't changed. Not being a suspicious person I chalk it up to us just slowing down as we get older. I'm OK with it and Sarah seems to be too. 

 One evening, the kids are in their rooms studying. Sarah comes into my home office. 

 "Honey, we need to talk." 

 This is something that every man doesn't want to hear. I let go of my mouse and turn to her. 

 "OK, you first." 

 "Before I tell you this I want you to know I love you with all my heart and soul. I'm completely happy with our life." 

 "OK, what's on your mind?" 

 "I have a lover." 

 My blood turns to ice water. I just look at her for a few seconds. My corporate minds kicks in. Never let them see your weakness. The anger and hurt hits me but my ice water blood holds it in check. I can see in her eyes she isn't kidding. 

 "You're serious. Do I know who has the pleasure of your favors?" 

 "You don't need to know that." 

 "I want to ask why. Is it something I've done or not done? I thought we were very happy with our life. I can't think of a reason you would want to destroy it." 

 "Please. I don't want to destroy it. I'm perfectly content with our life. I love you. You're a perfect lover and husband. I couldn't ask for a better father for our children. It's has nothing to do with you. I was a virgin when we got married. I just want to have a little fling to see what it's like to be with someone else. It has nothing to do with us. I'll never neglect you for him. I love you and I want to grow old with you and spoil our grandchildren." 

 I know what I have to do. Our marriage is done and she is going to be out of my life as soon as I can get it done. I decide to rake her over the coals. I want her to feel some of the pain I'm feel. 

 "Do you think of how much you love me when you're driving to his house. When your pussy is getting wet thinking of his cock." 

 "It's not like that." 

 "Do you think of how much you love me when you're taking your clothes off for him?" 

 "Please, Eric." 

 "Do you think of how much you love me when you're on your knees sucking his cock?" 

 She doesn't answer. She just looks at the floor." 

 "Do you think of how much you love me when his cock slides into your pussy?" 

 Still no answer or eye contact. 

 "Do you think about how much you love me when you both cum and pumps your pussy full of his cum?" 

 A tear falls down her cheek. 

 "Do you think about how much you love me when you come home full of his cum." 

 Nothing but a couple of more tears. 

 "Do you think about how much you love me when you let me eat his cream pie or when you give me sloppy seconds?" 

 "I never did that. I always cleaned up for you." 

 "Tell me what your marriage vows mean to you. There's something in there about "No other". Do you remember that part." 

 She sniffs and more tears run down her cheeks. 

 "Have you told the kids yet." 

 "No." 

 "How do you think they will react. Do you think they will like to have two part time parents." 

 "They don't know. If you'll let me do this it will be over soon." 

 "Well my dear loving wife. You're right about that. It will be over soon. I'm going to file for divorce and I'm going to tell the kids. The have a right to know what a slut they have for a mother." 

 "Please, we can get through this. I love you and I want our family to stay together. Please, let me do this and I promise I'll be the best wife in the world." 

 "Not a fucking chance in hell it's going to happen. I'll be contacting a divorce lawyer in the morning right after I go to a clinic and get checked for STD." 

 "I talked to a lawyer. He says I'll get half of everything we have. You'll destroy your company. All the people that depend on you will be destroyed." 

 'Would you really do that. Destroy two marriages, destroy something it took years to build, and put all those people out of a job." 

 "No, of course not. He said that's what a judge would do." 

 "I'll find a place to stay tonight. I'll try to figure some way to settle this with you. You can tell the kids about your insane idea. I'm sure they'll give you their blessing." 

 "Please, Eric. Don't do this. Please don't break up our family." 

 "I'm not. You are. It's all on your head. Deal with it." 

 I sit for a minute holding my head in my hands. The tears start to flow. I quickly get up and go in the bedroom. I pack three suits and three dress shirts in my val pac. Some casual clothes, socks and underwear go in the suitcase. I go in the bathroom and lock the door. I sit on the toilet and cry like a baby. My life just went into a black hole. The love of my life just stuck a sharp knife in my back. 

 After a while I cry myself out. I pack my toiletries in my kit and go back to the bedroom. Sarah is laying on the bed sobbing. I give her a cold look and get dressed. I pick up laptop, my bags and walk out the door. 

 ***************** 

 As I lie sobbing on my bed I hear Eric walk out of my life. I'm overwhelmed with fear. The love of my life is gone. I knew he would be mad and hurt, but I felt so guilty I had to tell him. I can only hope he will get over it and come home. I need to talk with him and tell him I won't see Brian anymore. Maybe I can convince him it's over and I'll be a good wife for him. I'll just tell the kids that we had a big fight and he walked out. I finally fall asleep. I dream that I'm standing on a mountain top. A cold wind is blowing and I'm all alone. 

 I wake the next morning to the sound of the kids getting ready for school. I drag myself out of bed and wash my face with cold water. I look in the mirror and see how bad I look. Black circles around my red eyes. I go to the kitchen to make them breakfast. 

 Amy walks in first. 

 "Wow, Mom. You look terrible. What happened?" 

 "Sit down and eat your breakfast." 

 "Mom! What the hell happened." 

 "Your father and I had a big fight last night. He left." 

 "He left? When is he coming back?" 

 "I don't know honey. He was really mad when he left." 

 "This must have been serious. You need to talk to him and get him back." 

 "I'll try. I'll give him some time to cool down." 

 Kevin was standing listening. 

 "Mom. Don't wait too long. You have to get him back." 

 "I know. Let's just give him a couple of days." 

 Both of them are looking at me like I did something horrible. They can see it in my eyes. I watch them finish eating and go out the door. I lay my head on the table and cry. 

 ***************** 

 Laying in the dark motel room my mind kicks into the corporate mode. I push the pain and anger back. I need to make some plans. No fucking way will Sarah get half of my company. I busted my hump for ten years to make it work. I debate what to do about her. I could leave her without a penny. Let her hot lover take care of her. A list forms in my mind. Finally I fall asleep. 

 The alarm jolts me awake. I sit up and look around. It all comes back to me. Anger and pain hits me. I push it back. I need to act. 

 I shower and get dressed. 

 I walk by my secretary. He mouth is hanging open. She knows the shit is about to hit the fan. She follows me into my office. 

 "OK, Eric. What happened?" 

 "Nothing good. I'm going to divorce Sarah. Call legal and security. In my office in ten minutes." 

 "Yes Sir." 

 Five minutes later the head of security and my best legal man are sitting in front of my desk. 

 "Benson. Fill out whatever paper work is necessary and move the company offshore." 

 His mouth falls open. 

 "What's going on, Eric?" 

 "I'm filing for divorce. I don't want my wife getting her hands on this company. Move everything as fast as you can." 

 "I'm on it. It may take a few days." 

 "OK. Just get it moving." 

 He bolts out the door and l look at my head of security. 

 "My wife has a boyfriend. Get her cell phone records and bring them to me. I want to know who he is, where he lives, everything you can get on him. If you need outside help, get it." 

 "I'm on it." 

 I call accounting. 

 "Accounting? I want my wife's credit card changed. Put a $200 limit every 24 hours on it. 

 'Mary, get me the bank that holds the mortgage on my house." 

 "Yes. Sir." 

 Three minutes later my phone beeps. 

 "Sir, Its Jerry Barnes, your banker. He's on line one." 

 "Thanks, Mary. 

 I punch up line one. 

 "Hi, Jerry. Eric Jensen here. I need to check on my mortgage. What's the payoff on it." 

 "Let me pull it up. Ummm it's about 300 K. do you want to pay it off?" 

 "Not now. Is it underwater?" 

 "No, it's in pretty good shape. If you sell it you could make about 75K." 

 "OK, I'm getting a divorce. Just let it sit there. I'll let her have it if she can handle the payments. If not I'll sell it." 

 "OK. It's on hold till I hear from you." 

 "Thanks, bye." 

 "Mary, call legal and get me the name of a good divorce lawyer." 

 My phone beeps. 

 "Yes, Mary." 

 "One of the guys in legal used to do family law. Shall I have him come down?" 

 "Yes, Please." 

 Ten minutes later. 

 "Yes, Mary." 

 "Todd Wilkins from legal is here." 

 "Thank you. Send him in." 

 'Hi, Todd. Have a seat." 

 "How can I help you, Sir" 

 'I understand you did some divorce law before you came here." 

 "Yes, Sir. It was really dirty law. I quit it." 

 "Tell me about the laws here." 

 "They have a saying here." 

 "A saying? What is it?" 

 "It's cheaper to keep her." 

 "What do you mean?" 

 "It's a no fault state. All assets are split fifty fifty unless one is deemed unfit." 

 "Unfit? What does it take to make that case?" 

 "Usually some criminal behavior like being on drugs or something outside the law." 

 "So, my wife would get half of this company?" 

 "Yes, unless you had a prenuptial agreement." 

 "What about if it was an offshore company." 

 "It's state law. She couldn't touch it. No jurisdiction. Any savings, retirement accounts or property would be split. If she didn't work you would have to pay alimony too. If you have kids, toss in some child support. Going offshore would protect your company." 

 "OK, thanks Todd. You've been a great help." 

 An hour later my security man shows up. 

 "OK, what do you have for me?" 

 "I found a lot of calls to and from a Brian Wilson. He's in insurance. Makes about 100K a year. Married with three kids. His house is paid for. Two cars. Wife doesn't work. Looks like a nice happy family from the outside." 

 "That son of a bitch. These two have ruined two families. All of this for some pussy. What a fucking waste. Well, Mr. Wilson, welcome to divorce court." 

 "Do you need anything else on him. I can go deeper." 

 "No, that's enough. I just need his number." 

 "It's here in my report." 

 "Thanks for a great job." 

 "You're welcome. If you need anything else, just call." 

 I'm thinking how this really sucks. I have to drop the hammer on this prick. His wife and kids will suffer. He fucked up my marriage and I'm going to fuck his up. 

 "Wilson insurance. How may I help you." 

 "Mr. Wilson. This is Eric Jensen. Sarah's husband. Does you wife know you're fucking my wife?" 

 "Oh fuck. She told you." 

 "I'm afraid so. How is you wife going to take the news?" 

 "Please, don't do this. I have a family. This will destroy my marriage. Please don't do this." 

 "Look, you prick. I have a family too. You destroyed my marriage. Why should you get a pass?" 

 "You're going to tell her?" 

 "I can or you can. Take your pick." 

 "Can you give me a couple of days." 

 "I'll call her tomorrow. That should give you enough time." 

 I hear a click as he hangs up. 

 I sit for a minute to think. I need a place to live. I buzz Mary. 

 "Yes, Sir." 

 "Can you check and see if one of the company apartments is open. I need a place to live." 

 "Yes, Sir. I'll check. How big of a place do you need." 

 "I'm not sure. Find out what we have. I don't know about my kids yet." 

 "I'm on it." 

 "Thanks, Mary. You're a lifesaver." 

 "It sounds like you need one. If you need to talk, I'm here." 

 "Thanks. I'll keep that in mind." 

 I realize I haven't eaten since last night. Just as I get ready to leave for lunch my cell goes off. I look and see it's Amy. 

 "Hi, baby." 

 "Hi, Daddy. I'm here with Kevin on speaker. What's going on with you and Mom. She said you and her had a big fight and you left." 

 All the pain and anger comes back. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. My voice cracks as I tell her. 

 "That's sorta what happened. Your Mom has a boyfriend. She told me last night. I lost it and left." 

 "Oh my god, Daddy. How could she do that. That's horrible." 

 I hear Kevin in the background, "Holy shit, what a slut. Cheating on Dad like that." 

 "Kevin. Please. She's still you mother." 

 "Bullshit, Dad. My Mom would never do that. She's a slut in my Mom's body. This is unforgivable." 

 "Dad, I'm going to give her a piece of my mind. I agree with Kevin." 

 "Please, you guys take it easy on her. We'll get through this. OK?" 

 "I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm going to have my say. She can't hurt you like this and get away with it." 

 "Come by the office after school. I'll take you out to eat. How does that sound." 

 "OK, Daddy. We'll see you then. Bye bye." 

 "Bye bye." 

 After sitting at my desk for a hour feeling sorry for myself I decide to get something to eat. I get a sandwich at the Deli across the street from our building. While I'm eating Mary comes in. 

 "I got some information on the company housing. There are three two bedroom apartments empty. I can call and reserve one for you." 

 "Thanks, Mary. That's fine. Hold two for me. I suspect the kids will want to leave home. I'll move in tomorrow. I've paid for my motel already. My kids are coming in soon. Just send them right in. Also, mark my calendar out tomorrow. I may need to get my kids set up with a place to live." 

 She turns and walks out. 

 My desk phone buzzes. 

 "Hello." 

 "Eric, this is Barnes in legal. About the move offshore. It's going to take about a week. It's in the works but there is a ton of paperwork." 

 ""OK, sounds good. I can hold Sarah off for a week. If she files we're screwed. I'll take care of her tomorrow." 

 *************** 

 Kevin, Amy and I are sitting in a back booth at the Olive Garden. 

 "Daddy. What are we going to do?" 

 "That depends on what you want. Where do you want to live. With me or your Mom." 

 "Geez, Dad. We can't live with her. I get sick thinking about it. We want to live with you. We're all hurting and we need each other. The only way we can get through this is to stick together. Let her stew in her own juice." 

 Some times I wonder how old Amy is. In many ways she is very mature for her age. She certainly has a grasp on our situation. 

 "OK, let's do it this way. You go home tonight and pack everything you want. Load it in your car before you go to school. I'll set up a company apartment for you. Come to the office after school and we'll get you moved in. They're furnished so just bring personal stuff. I know one night there will be tough, but you can get through it." 

 "OK, Dad. I guess that's the best way." 

 "I'll go talk to Sarah tomorrow and let her know what's going on." 

 "You gonna let her talk you into moving back home?" 

 "Not a chance. She broke trust and that's the end as far as I'm concerned. I could never live with that." 

 "That's the right decision, Dad." 

 "Finish your dinner and go home. Try not to unload on your mother. I know you're mad at her but she is hurting too." 

 "I can't promise that, Dad. I'm really pissed at what she's done to you. She destroyed everything." 

 ****************** 

 As I wander through my house, everything reminds me of what a wonderful marriage I had. It's all gone now. I know in my heart that Eric will never be here with me again. My whole world has crashed around me and it's all my fault. 

 Just as I pour another cup of coffee I hear a car pull into the driveway. This isn't going to be pretty. I'm sure they talked to Eric and know what I did.  

 

 ****** Another Cheating Wife Story ****** byGotBaconÂ© The front door opens and both kids walk in. They pass by the kitchen and go straight to their rooms. Ten minutes later Kevin walks into the kitchen. He opens the cabinet under the sink and pulls out a box of trash bags. He gives me a cold look and goes back to his room. I jump up and follow him. 

 "Kevin, what are you doing." 

 "Packing my stuff." 

 "Kevin, this is your home. Please don't leave. Please." 

 "I don't want to live here. It's not my home anymore." 

 I watch as he turns and goes in his room. I hear the lock click. I stumble into my bedroom and fall on the bed, sobbing. I've lost my husband and now my children. I hear Kevin and Amy talking. I can't make out what they're saying. After a while Kevin comes out with four bags in his hands. He makes two more trips and I don't see them again. 

 The next morning I hear them getting ready for school. I drag myself to the kitchen and make breakfast. Amy walks in. She has her book bag and her laptop. She looks at the food and then at me. I can see the anger in her eyes. 

 "I'm not hungry, Mom." 

 "Please eat something. I made your favorite." 

 "I'm going now, Mom. Have a nice life." 

 "Please, Amy. Don't leave me." 

 "I'm going to Dad's He needs me." 

 "I need him too, Please don't do this." 

 "Mom, You hurt him. I held him while he cried like a baby. You destroyed our family. I hope it was worth it." 

 She turns and walks out. Two minutes, without a word, later Kevin follows her. The worst has come to visit me. I'm lost my husband and my children. I'm alone. 

 **************** 

 My alarm clock jolts me awake. I sit up, rub my eyes and scratch my balls. Showered and dressed, I head for the office. I check with Mary and get the keys to the apartments. I have no emergency appointments so I screw up my courage to call Mrs. Wilson. Another thing I don't want to do. 

 "Hello." 

 "Hello, Mrs. Wilson?" 

 "Yes." 

 "This is Eric Jensen. I think we need to talk." 

 "Yes. I suppose we do." 

 "I don't want to do this over the phone. Can we meet somewhere." 

 "Yes. Can you come here? I'm not fit to be seen in public." 

 "I understand. How about in one hour?" 

 "That's fine. Do you have my address?" 

 "Yes, maam. I'll see you soon, bye bye." 

 "Goodbye." 

 ****************** 

 "Hello, Mrs. Wilson." 

 "Come in, Mr. Jensen. Let's go in the kitchen. I made some coffee." 

 I watch her as she pours two cups of coffee. She's quite pretty, but looking a little bit worse for wear. Considering she probably spent the night crying I think she would brush up just fine. 

 "I wanted to meet with you to see that you're OK. I have considerable resources at my disposal so if you need any help please let me know." 

 "Thank you. I don't know what I'm going to do yet. I'm not quite over the shock. I know our marriage can't go on like this. I suppose we'll get divorced. I won't live with a cheater." 

 "I talked with a divorce attorney. He told me I would be better off to stay married but live apart. I would have to pay her half the value of my company. I can't do that. You might be better off divorcing. You should contact one and see what your options are." 

 "You have kids. How are they taking it?" 

 "Pretty well considering. They are really mad at her. She destroyed a really great marriage just for a little sex on the side. The bad part is everyone else that gets hurt. I guess they thought they could play and no one would find out." 

 "They always get caught in the end." 

 "Guilt drove my wife to tell me. I didn't have a clue about it." 

 "I didn't either. Our sex life dropped off a little but I didn't think anything about it. I thought it might be work related." 

 "I didn't ask Sarah. Did he tell you how long it was going on?" 

 "He said about twice a week for a month." 

 "And neither of us suspected a thing." 

 "Amazing, huh?" 

 "Well, I have to run. I have to get my kids settled in. Please remember, it you need anything at all just call me. Also, try to remember none of this is your fault. They just did something stupid and now everyone is suffering." 

 I give her my card and leave. It's time to see Sarah. I call her. 

 "Hello Sarah. Will you be home. I need to talk to you." 

 "Yes, Eric. Do you want some lunch. I can make it for you." 

 "No, thanks. I'm having a working lunch later. I'll be there in twenty minutes." 

 "OK, I'll put on some coffee. Bye bye." 

 Fifteen minutes later I pull into what used to be my driveway. I knock on the door. 

 "Come in, Eric. You don't need to knock. Come and sit." 

 "I just came by to tell you what's going on. I've decided not to divorce you." 

 "OH god, does that mean you're considering coming back home." 

 "No. I'm going to be staying in one of the company apartments. The kids want to stay there too." 

 "Eric, I've been thinking. Maybe we can go to a counselor. Maybe it would help us work out our problems and get back together." 

 "Sarah. You're not being realistic. I won't ever be able to trust you again. Every time you were out of my sight I would be wondering who you're fucking. I can't live like that. You may never cheat again, but it would always be in the back of my mind." 

 "I suppose you're right. I never thought to that." 

 "If I didn't have a conscience I would leave you standing on the street with your finger up you ass. You're the mother of my children and we had a lot of good years together. I'll put you on the company payroll and pay you $2500 a month. I checked and there is about 75K equity in the house. You can sell it or stay here. It's up to you. I'll sign my share of the equity over to you. After Kevin graduates you're on you own. I hope you won't do anything to the company. There are too many people depending on it for survival. They don't deserve to be brought into this." 

 "I won't do that. I've hurt enough people. I don't want to hurt anyone else." 

 "Eric, will you think about the counseling. Maybe we could make it work." 

 "I can't make any promises. I'm too hurt and angry now to think straight." 

 "I know you don't want to hear it, but I'm so sorry I hurt you and the kids. I never wanted to do that." 

 "I'm sorry too. I talked to Brian. He told his wife. I think she is going to divorce him. Whatever happens, you're free from you marriage vows. You can fuck anyone now. Maybe you and Brian can get something lasting going." 

 "I don't love him, Eric. I love you. I'll always love you." 

 I go in the bedroom and pack up the rest of my clothes. I see tears running down her cheeks as I walk out. I breathe a sigh of relief as I drive out of her life. 

 ***************** 

 On the way back I stop at Wal Mart and buy some kitchen utensils, paper plates, cups, a coffee pot and a toaster. I stop at a supermarket and buy a bunch of food. The last stop is at the motel. I pack all my clothes and go to the apartment. I get settled in and kick back on the sofa. I turn on the TV for some audio wallpaper and think about my future. 

 Two hours later I'm back in my office waiting for school to let out. My phone buzzes. 

 "Eric, Mr. Barnes is here." 

 "Thank you, Mary. Send him in." 

 "I fast tracked all the paper work. We'll be officially off shore on Monday." 

 "Great job. Then I can breathe. My company will be safe." 

 The kids show up and I get them moved in. We order a pizza and sit around the coffee table talking about our plans. I tell them what I'm doing with Sarah. The just look at me. I guess they expected me to dump her on the street. 

 Over the next few weeks we settle into a comfortable routine. It's Friday evening and I decide to give Mrs. Wilson a call to check on her. 

 "Hi, Mrs. Wilson. Eric Jensen here." 

 "Hi, Mr. Jensen. Please, call me Tina. Mrs sounds so formal." 

 "OK, and you call me Eric. I just wanted to touch base with you to see how you're doing." 

 "I'm doing OK. Things have settled down a little. Brian has moved all of his stuff out. We're still working on the details on the divorce." 

 "Ah, I see. You decided to get a divorce." 

 'Yes. I think it's best. Then we're both free from each other. I want to see him as little as possible." 

 "I understand that. I'm going to wait till the kids are out of high school before I divorce Sarah. I gave her a release from her marriage vows. Maybe she and Brian can get together now." 

 "I don't know what Brian has planned. I didn't ask and I don't really care." 

 "I was just thinking. How about we go out to dinner tomorrow night. I haven't been out in a while. It might be fun to see what the rest of the world is doing." 

 "That sounds nice. You make the reservations and let me know what time to be ready." 

 "Great. I'll call you as soon as I know." 

 "Bye bye." 

 "Goodbye, Tina."

 Over the next few weeks Tina and I went to dinner every Saturday night. We became very comfortable in each others company. I came to learn that she had good common sense. She was comfortable with herself and the choices she had made in life. Her marriage to Brian had been just fine till he decided he couldn't keep it in his pants. She recovered well from the trauma. Actually we both did and it got pushed to the back of our minds. We joked about things in our life that came up in our talk sessions. She always dressed conservatively and with very good taste. She was a beautiful woman but didn't flaunt it. 

 On one particular evening I got a surprise. She opened the door and my jaw dropped. She had on a white blouse that was just transparent enough that a hint of her nipples showed. He breasts seemed bigger without her bra. Despite having had three kids they stood high and proud. She smiled as my eyes ran up and down her body. She had a short black skirt on that came just above mid thigh. He black thigh high hose set it off. She had beautiful legs that I hadn't seen up till now. I wondered if she had panties on. I would find out later. I was impressed and I suspected I was going to get laid that night. I quickly decided that we would go dancing after dinner. I definitely wanted to hold her in my arms. When I mentioned it she just gave me a sexy look and a smile. My cock twitched. She pulled me to her and kissed me on the lips. 

 "Let's go. I'm starving." 

 I found my voice and agreed. 

 After dinner we were sitting against the wall listening to the band. There was a piano player, a guy on a sax, a guy on the drums and a girl playing a tambourine. I suspected she was the vocal of the group. We sat holding hands and working on a carafe of White Zinfandel. The girls stepped up to the mic and sang a very nice love ballad. She stepped back and they started a slow set. 

 I pulled Tina to the floor. She moved into my like she belonged there. He full breasts touched my chest and I heard her gasp. I wasn't sure why and I didn't care. I pulled her close and we floated around the floor. She stayed close with her pelvis bone on my thigh. He head was resting on my chest and my half hard cock was pressing in her stomach. We danced two slow ones and returned to our table. He face looked flushed and hand a big smile on it. 

 "This is so nice, Eric. It's been a long time since I danced." 

 "It's been a while for me too. I'm surprised I remembered how." 

 "You did. You're a great dancer." 

 "I guess it's like riding a bicycle." 

 We sat out two fast ones and they started another slow set. I pulled her to the floor again and he gasped again as her breasts touched my chest. I finally caught on. She had sensitive nipples that weren't used to being without a bra. I filed that away for later. 

 We danced to another slow one and I noticed she was moving her pelvis bone against my thigh. I could feel her breathing increase. All of a sudden she shivered and held me tight. I head a little moan escape her lips. I held her close till the end of the song and we went back to our seats. We sat down and I leaned over and kissed her. He lips opened and her tongue slipped into my mouth. She gasped and her hand went behind my head. We held the kiss for what seemed like two hours. My hand found her breast and I tweaked her nipple. She cried out in my mouth and shivered again. We broke the kiss and sat back. She had a death grip on my arm. 

 "I need to go to the ladies room. Top off my glass and we can leave as soon a I finish it." 

 A few minutes later she came back. She sat and took my hand in hers. I felt her put something wet in my hand. I looked down and saw I was holding a pair of panties. I looked at her and said, "Thanks for a nice gift." 

 She blushed and just smiled at me as I put them in my pocket. I flagged the waitress and settled up our tab. She leaned over and whispered in my ear. 

 "I got so wet dancing with you I had to go dry off." 

 "I could tell you were enjoying yourself. I'm glad I could do that for you." 

 "You're going to to a lot more than that, big boy. I have plans for you tonight." 

 "Let's get out of here and you can tell me about them." 

 We got in my car and she pulled the console up and pushed it between the seats. She scooted over next to me. she put one hand on my thigh and pulls my hand off the wheel. She put it on her thigh and pushed it slowly up her leg. I felt moisture before I got close to her pussy. She pulled it up further and I found her shaved pussy. I slid a finger over her lips and found her clit sticking out. It must have been at least a half inch long. I touched it with my fingertip and she went rigid. Her head fell back and her eyes closed. She humped up and cried out. 

 She finally relaxed and her hand found my bulging cock. She quickly unzipped my pants and pulled it out. She ran her finger over the head and wiped up a drop of pre cum. She put her finger in her mouth and licked it clean. 

 We didn't talk much on the way to her house. I made her cum two more times. She gently stroked me, keeping me hard all the way. I pulled into her driveway and started to put my cock back in my pants. 

 "No, don't. Let it stick out. I want to see it while we walk in." 

 I left it sticking out and walked around. I helped her out. She took my cock in her hand and led me to the door. With one hand she unlocked it and pulled me inside. She kept her grip on my cock and led me to her bedroom. She sat on the bed and started blowing me. It was all I could do to keep from falling down. I felt my pants and boxers fall around my feet. I managed to get my shirt off and kicked my shoes and pants off. She stood up and pushed me back on the bed. My cock was sticking straight up at the ceiling. She stepped back and took off her blouse. She tossed it over her shoulder and shook her breasts at me. I watched them sway as her skirt fell around her feet. 

 "Leave your hose on for me, Please. The look really hot." 

 I could see her pussy juice running down her legs. I held my arms out and she came to me. I pulled her down beside me on the bed. He hard nipples touched my chest and she moaned. I decided to give them a good work over. I wasn't disappointed. She came twice as I sucked and tweaked them. I licked my way down to her pussy. She was soaked. Her juice was running down over her asshole making a huge wet spot. I fell between her legs and started trying to lick up all of her juice. I didn't make it. 

 It ran through my mind that her husband had to be the stupidest person on the planet. She was the most orgasmic woman I ever met. She came over and over and her juice was a never ending stream. I licked and sucked her to three orgasms before I slid my cock in her. She came as soon as she felt my cock touch her pussy lips. As I slid in her I felt her muscles start to work. I bottomed out and she came again. I knew I wouldn't be able to last long the way her muscles were squeezing me. I pulled back out till my cock head was touching her G spot. I flexed it and heard her scream. I waited till she was at the peak of her orgasm and flexed again. He screams filled the room. I got her off two more time and bottomed out. He muscles took over and she milked to a blazing orgasm. I must have pumped a gallon in her It seemed to last for an hour. 

 Finally, I was drained and fell on her. She wrapped her legs around my ass and held me tight. 

 "mmmm. That was wonderful. I must have cum twenty times. You're quite a lover." 

 All I could do was groan in response. I must have gotten too heavy on her. She unhooked her legs and rolled me off. I finally found my voice. 

 "Holy crap, Tina. What did you do to me. I think my cock exploded." 

 "It did. All over inside me. I think you shot at least a gallon in me." 

 "I may have suffered some brain damage on that one. That was amazing." 

 "You may before I let you go. We have all night and tomorrow to turn your brain to mush." 

 "I think you're threatening me with a good time." 

 We fucked again that night. She rode me into a coma. I woke the next morning to the smell of bacon and coffee. I knew I had died and went to heaven. I found the shower and cleaned up. I didn't bother with clothes. I hoped her kids hadn't come home. I found her in front of the stove as naked as the day she was born. She turned and smiled. I got a good look at her for the first. He shaved pussy stood out like a neon sign. I saw her little pink clit sticking out. 

 "God, what a beautiful sight to wake up to." 

 "You look pretty hot too. Did you sleep well last night?" 

 "Like the dead. Someone pillaged and plundered me last night." 

 "I did that and I'm proud of it. I should tell you. I waited for you to make a move on you. You didn't so I took the initiative." 

 "You sure did. You blew me away when you opened you door. I guess you saw my mouth hanging open." 

 "It's nice to be appreciated. Especially by a handsome hunk." 

 "I never thought of myself as a hunk. Thanks for the compliment." 

 "Well, you are. And you have a really nice cock." 

 We both chuckled. 

 She filled a plate with a wonderful breakfast. I pigged out. She sat across from me eating and watching me. She poured me a second cup and we made plans for the rest of the day. She informed me that we would stay naked and fuck till I left and that her kids wouldn't be back till this evening. 

 I got a little surprise just before noon. She came out of her bedroom with a condom and a bottle of lube. She handed it to me and smiled. 

 "Fuck me in my ass." 

 She got on her elbows and knees in front of me. I was stunned for a minute. I came to and got behind her. I put the condom on and lubed it up. Next I gave her a nice workout with my fingers. She kept pushing back on my fingers. I lined up my cock against her little pucker and shoved slowly into her. She was so tight I almost came. I held off and stroked in her. My hand found her pussy and I worked her clit over. She started howling and cumming. She squeezed my cock hard and I filled the condom. I fell on her back and we both collapsed. I held her to me by both breasts. She finally stirred and pulled off the condom. She tied it in a knot and tossed it in a trash can by the sofa. It took me a few minutes to get up enough strength to get back on the sofa. She sat on my lap and we hugged and kissed. 

 "You're an amazing woman, Tina. Truly amazing." 

 "I wanted to be good for you. I liked you from the first day I met you. 

 "I never thought we would be like this. I just wanted to be a friend." 

 "I did to. Now we can be fuck friends." 

 "You're on. Fuck friends it is." 

 We fucked twice more that day. She rode me reverse cowgirl and I fucked her doggie. At about five I managed to haul my worn out ass home. My kids heard me come in and came over. They teased me for about an hour. They told me how happy they were for me. I finally begged off and took a nap. 

 ******************* 

 For the next few months Tina and I got together every weekend. We almost succeeded in fucking each other to death. She was way more woman than I could handle. I never asked what she did during the week and she never told me. I didn't think she was seeing anyone else. I'm not sure how I would have reacted if she was.  

 

 ****** Another Cheating Wife Story ****** byGotBaconÂ© He divorce came final. She got $5000 per month alimony and $800 for each of her kids. She got the house and a new car. I guess Brian did quite well in business. She never indicated there were any problems. 

 Over the months, the kids mellowed toward their mother. The started out with lunch dates and slowly worked into a closer relationship. I heard tidbits of stuff about her. She started dating and went through quite a few men before she met a nice guy. The dated for about a year and finally moved in together. I never heard if they got married or not. I finally filed for divorce and the lawyers handled it. We didn't ask for anything from each other. 

 Amy graduated from high school and enrolled in UCLA. She majored in business but I think she was just shopping for a husband. She met a guy that was in his senior. His major was computer science. He was a good kid and was madly in love with her. She got all gooey every time she talked about him. They married a year after he graduated. He landed a good job and they gave me three beautiful grandchildren. 

 Kevin graduated from high school and enrolled at MIT. He wanted to be a mechanical engineer. He ended up specializing in robotics. He had girlfriends but hesitated getting married. I never pressured him about it. I suspect it had something to do with his mother. 

 After Kevin graduated from high school I took Sarah off the payroll. I never heard a word from her. I did notice that she sold the house. Over the years I heard less and less about her from the kids. I never asked about their relationship with her. We both moved on. 

 Tina and I stayed fuck buddies. We never discussed marriage. We were both gun shy about it. Finally after two years we moved in together. We had a great relationship. We were good for each other in and out of the bed. She never gave me any indication that she had anything on the side. 

 I got along really well with her kids. One of them ended up working for me. He was a genius behind the keyboard. The other two moved on, got married and gave Tina lots of grandchildren. 

 I retired years later. I sold ten percent of my stock to retire on and split the rest between Kevin and Amy. Kevin kept an eye on the business for a a few years and then both of them sold their stock. They cashed out with 2.5 million each. It stayed in a Cayman Island bank. Tina and I are living in Costa Rica enjoying life in the tropics. Report_Story
