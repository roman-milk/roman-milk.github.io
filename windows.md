It's the little things that fuck your life up. I mean you know that the big things might happen so you try to prepare for them. You try to squeeze a little bit out of every paycheck to put in savings against that rainy day you get laid off or the company you are working for goes bankrupt. You cover your house with insurance to protect you against fire, flood, and hail damage or some other disaster. You are always looking for the big things, hoping that they won't happen, but trying to be ready if they do. 

It's the little things that kill you. Mail the house payment on time, but forget to put a stamp on the envelope and get a late payment tick on your credit report. Let your kid use your car to go out on a date and don't check the gas gauge in the morning; run out of gas on the way to work and have your boss yell at you for being late. Take your wife out to a nice restaurant and go use the restroom. Forget to zip up and walk back to your table with your shirttail sticking out your fly to everyone's amusement. 

Well, it was a little thing that got me. Actually it was more like a schoolboy prank that backfired and bit me on the ass. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Ever wonder why when you are out having dinner with friends or when you are at a party and a woman gets up to go to the bathroom one or two other women will get up and go with her? I did; wonder about it I mean. Alice and I would be somewhere and be sitting with other people and Alice would say, "Would you guys excuse me please? I've got to go to the lady's room," and another woman would say, "Wait up, I'll go with you." Guys didn't do that. I never saw it happen with two or three guys, but I'd always seen it with girls and I'd seen it ever since I started dating in my early teens. 

I wondered if it was something in a woman's genes; something passed down from generation to generation. What was it? One had to hold the hem of the other's skirt or dress to keep it from touching the floor? Who knew? It wasn't something that the women talked about and I guess I was the only guy really curious about it because I never heard any of the other guys pondering the question. But I had wondered and I was curious. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Alice and I were at a party at Paul and Pam's. About an hour in the party Angie got up to go to the bathroom and Linda got up and went with her. Half an hour later Mary made the trip with Margie tagging along behind her. I'd had just enough to drink to be loose and I got this great idea. Remember back in high school the rumor that was always going around about the peephole that let you look into the girl's locker room? I never saw it and I don't know anyone else who did, but you always heard, "Did you hear about ________? He was looking through the peephole into the girls locker room and he swears he saw_______." I remembered that and I thought of looking into the bathroom when a couple of women went in there just to find out why they all went in there in pairs. I knew that even though I would like to I never would because getting caught would fuck up your life big time, but what if you could listen in? 

When Mary and Margie got back I got up and went to the john and opened the window a crack so that I could stand outside and listen to what was going on. I went back to the party, got a fresh drink and waited to see who would go next. About ten minutes later I saw Helen grab her purse and get up from the table and a half-second later Vickie got up to go with her. I went out the patio door and was waiting under the window when the two of them walked into the room. 

H: "I've got to cut down on my drinking. I'm making too many trips to this room." V: "I stopped drinking at these parties. I stick to ginger ale or soda water now." H: "I need to cut out drinking before what happened to Sally happens to me." V: "I know what you mean. Do you think Robert knows?" H: "I doubt it. If he knew he would have killed Randy by now. V: "I know she was drunk when she did it the first time, but why does she keep doing it?" H: "She does it because Randy has a huge cock." V: "Huge?" H: "Almost ten inches long and hard as a rock." V: "How do you know that?" (Sound of the toilet flushing.) H: "When Mike and I separated a while back I played a little with Randy. It was a hell of an experience and I highly recommend it if you ever get the chance." V: "Oh my god, I couldn't do that. I could never cheat on Harry." H: "I doubt if Sally would let you get close to him anyway so it's probably a moot point." (The toilet flushed again.) V: "Why didn't you stay with him if he was that good?" H: "Cause he was a dick. (Some laughing and then) A dick head with a dick. His cock was the only thing he had going for him." 

And then they left the room. Was that the secret? They went in groups of anywhere from two to five or six so they could gossip? I started to go back to the party when I heard the bathroom door open and a woman giggle. Myra Thomas said, "What are you giggling about Sarah?" 

"I know something that you don't know." 

"Yeah, but do I want to know it?" 

"Of course you do. You always want to know the dirt on the girls." 

"So what do you know?" 

(I heard the sound of piss hitting the water in the toilet and then Myra said, "Hand me that wash rag please?" and then the toilet flushed.) 

"Guess which girl friend snuck out of the party and got some back seat time with Doug." 

"Give me a hint." 

"She has a clueless husband." 

Myra laughed, "Sweetie, you just described every woman here tonight. " 

"Okay, she is probably the one you wouldn't expect it from, at least not here with her husband with her." 

"Pam?" 

"No, but close." 

"Don't tell me. I want to go back to the party and see if I can pick her out by the way she looks or acts. If I haven't figured it out by the end of the night you can tell me." 

I heard the toilet flush and then Sarah said, "I like that shade of lipstick. Where did you get it?" 

"It's called Peach Zinger and I got it at Wal-Mart" and then I heard them leave the room. 

I was just a little pissed. My curiosity was peaked now; who the hell went out to the car with Doug for some 'back seat' time? And just what did 'back seat' time mean? Some heavy necking, or was there possibly a fresh cum stain on Doug's back seat? I'd already learned that Sally played around and now I wanted to know who played with Doug. I'd never gone stepping on Alice before, but if I ever did Sally would be up there on the list. I needed to get back to the party and do what Myra was doing - try to figure out who made the trip outside with Doug. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Half an hour later I still had no idea who Doug had talked into leaving the party with him. During that half-hour I saw several women hit the bathroom and I wondered what they had talked about, but I couldn't spend all my time under that window because I was bound to be missed. When I saw Myra and Sarah make a second trip to the bathroom I slipped out of the party and got back to where I could hear what was going on. I figured that Myra had figured it out and was going back to the john to get confirmation from Sarah. But it wasn't Myra and Sarah I heard. I don't know who it was because the voices were hoarse with passion. 

"That's it baby, suck on my clit. God but I wish you could do that forever. Here, let me get my hand in your bra so I can squeeze your nipples." 

(Loud moan.) 

"That's it, that's it, just like that. Oh god, I'm close, I'm close, oooohyeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh." 

(Loud moaning.) 

"God that was good baby. I'll do you next time." 

"We need to get back to the party before my hubby starts to wonder where I am." 

I hurried to get back inside the house so I could see who came out of the bathroom. Just as I turned the corner of the house Doug and Paul came out on the patio so I ducked back to the side of the house. Since there was no way to get inside to see who it was who had been in the bathroom I turned and went back to the window. I got there just in time to hear Myra say, "I don't know why I wasted my time trying to play sleuth. She has been such a total slut this past year that I should have taken it for granted that she was the one you saw." 

"Well yeah, but you have to give her a little credit. She has left the husbands of her friends alone. In fact, I don't think any of her paramours is married." 

"Yes, but is that because it is her choice or because we have all threatened to cut our hubby's balls off if we even catch them looking her way?" 

"I don't know, but she is my friend and so I will give her the benefit of the doubt." 

"You think her hubby knows? Think he may be one of those men who gets off on his wife putting out for other men?" 

"No, I don't think Rob has a clue. Nice guy, but not too bright where the wifey is concerned." 

All of a sudden I felt a chill run down my spine. There were only two Robs at the party and I was one of them. That meant that they were either talking about Fran or Alice. They said that the woman who had gone out to the car with Doug had been a total slut for the past year and I would have noticed if Alice had been behaving like that. So, it had to be Fran. Well, that fit. Rob Olsen wasn't all that bright. 

I moved back to the corner of the house, saw that the patio was clear, and I got back to the party. I started paying closer attention to Fran to see if I could pick up a vibe or see something that would give away what she and Doug had doing. I checked her out real close every chance I got with out being obvious about it, but I just couldn't see a thing that indicated that she had played fast and loose with Doug. Maybe Rob wasn't as dumb as I had thought. If I couldn't spot that she had just been fucked knowing that she had, how could he be expected to know when he wasn't even looking? I just filed Fran's name away for possible further attention just like I had Sally's. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was in the kitchen getting myself another drink when I saw Pam and my wife heading for the bathroom and I smiled to myself; I just couldn't pass this one up. I ducked out of the house and got to the window just in time to hear Pam say, "But what about Paul?" 

"In case you haven't noticed he is damned near falling down drunk. He won't even notice." 

"Look honey, I like Rob, but I'm not like you, I don't cheat on my husband." 

"I'm not asking you to do that. Just keep Rob occupied. You can do that. I've seen you kiss him half a dozen times over the years under the mistletoe at Christmas parties. Lead him on, let him cop a couple of feels and give him some really hot kisses with a touch of tongue. Just keep him occupied long enough for me to fuck Randy. He's here and Sally isn't so it might be my only chance for a while." 

"I don't know girlfriend. It is one thing to cover for you when Rob calls here looking for you, but it is something else again for me to do what you are asking. Hell honey, you didn't need for me to cover for you when you went out to Doug's car with him." 

"Didn't need you to. Doug was just some hot necking and a straight fuck and then we were back at the party. Randy is a different story. It takes time for him to work that huge log into you and then he seems to be able to fuck forever. I'm not sure that Rob wouldn't notice me being gone that long. That's why I need your help girlfriend." 

"God Alice, you are such a slut. You'll fuck anything with a cock. The only guys safe from you are my husband and your son. 

Alice giggled and said, "Well, you are half right." 

"What does that mean?" 

"It means that Paul is safe because I promised you." 

"You mean you would do your own son?" 

"I was his birthday present when he turned eighteen." 

"You slut you." 

"I know, isn't it great? Let me tell you girlfriend, there isn't anything like an energetic, young boy with a perpetually hard cock. If you ever decide to get a taste of strange you just let me know and I'll loan you Lance." 

"You still doing him?" 

"Every Thursday night when Rob goes bowling and any other time he will be out of the house for more than a couple of hours. So, will you help me out here?" 

"I'll try honey, but I can't promise he'll be interested enough in me to let me keep him occupied." 

"Just flash a little tit or let him see your panties somehow. He won't run away from you, I promise." 

I had approached the window with a smile on my face and a certain amount of smugness that I was going to put something over on Alice, but the smile and the smugness were gone; killed off by what I'd heard coming out of the slightly opened window. My wife and Doug, my wife and Randy and Myra's statement, "She's been a total slut for the past year" and worst of all, our son. I was too stunned by it all to even feel the anger and the rage that I knew would be breaking out soon. When it came, and I knew that it would, I was going to have to beat it down and try to remain calm. I couldn't afford to let it go unchecked because I could very well end up in jail if I did. That didn't mean that I wouldn't take my revenge, because I would; I most definitely would. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I returned to the party and put on a fake smile. I got a fresh drink and then I circulated and watched Randy and Alice without letting them see that I was watching their every move. I saw Randy move out to the patio and a couple of minutes later Alice followed. I went to the bathroom and locked the door behind me and then I opened the window and climbed out and dropped to the ground. Moving to the corner of the house I watched as Randy and Alice moved past the garage to the side street where the cars of most of the people at the party were parked. I saw them both get in Randy's car and then Randy started the car and drove it about two blocks down the street - away from the street light and any chance that someone leaving the party could see them. 

I turned and headed back to the party. From the patio I looked inside to see if I could see Pam and I saw her talking with Myra and Sarah. Her back was to me so I went inside and headed for the bathroom. No one was waiting to use it so I took a dime out of my pocket and used it to turn the little lock button in the center of the handle. I went inside, closed the window, turned off the light and then I headed for the kitchen. I got a glass of water, dropped a couple of ice-cubes in it and added a slice of lime so it would look like a vodka tonic and then I went back to the living room where Pam was. 

I saw Paul sitting over in a corner in an easy chair and it did look like Alice had been right - he was definitely out of it for a while. I circulated, talked to some people while occasionally checking on Pam to see if she was keeping track of me. After about ten minutes I began to look like I was looking for someone. Pam noticed and I saw her take a deep breath, down her drink and head for me. 

"Hey stranger, you have been ignoring me all night." 

I knew the game so I decided to be bold. "I don't trust myself around you sweetie and there isn't any mistletoe at this party that I can use as an excuse." 

Pam gave me a level glance and then said, "You need an excuse? I must be losing my touch." 

"Maybe not. Maybe I'm just afraid of you." 

"Afraid of me?" 

"Afraid of what you might cause me to do." 

"You? Mr. Steady Hand himself losing his control over little old me? That will be the day." 

"Sometimes I think you don't give yourself enough credit." 

I looked over her shoulder like I was looking for Alice and she reached up, took a handful of my shirt, pulled me to her and kissed me. 

"Didn't need any mistletoe to do that, now did I?" 

"No, but that was just an 'I'll show you' quick kiss in a room full of people knowing full well that anyone who saw it would take it for just what it was - a quick buss between good friends." 

I gave her a big smile and began looking around for Alice again. She glanced around to see if anyone was watching and satisfied that no one was she took my arm and led me from the room. As we were leaving the room Doug glanced our way and I winked at him and he smiled and gave me a thumbs up and I saw Myra look at us with disbelief on her face. In the hall, just outside the bathroom I took Pam in my arms, but she pushed me away. 

"Not here. I don't want someone on the way to the bathroom to see us." 

She led me into her bedroom, closed the door and then locked it. She turned to me, "No mistletoe and nobody watching. So, do you need an excuse or not?" 

I took her in my arms and gave her a long, lingering kiss and when I broke it I looked into her eyes and said, "Nice, very nice," and then I kissed her again only that time I put some steam into it. I felt the tip of her tongue flick at my lips and I responded. Over her shoulder I could see her in her dresser mirror kissing me while looking at the bedside clock. I could almost hear the gears turning in her head. "Alice and Randy have been gone about twenty minutes. I need to buy about ten more." She stepped in close and turned the heat up on the next kiss. 

For what I planned on doing I needed Pam to work at keeping me from going to look for Alice. She had to be the aggressor. I pulled back and said, "I don't know what we just proved, but I think that we had better get back to the party." 

"Oh no you don't. You don't get to tease me and then run. I get the feeling that you are holding back on me. I want the full voltage kiss." 

I pulled her back to me and gave her the hottest kiss I could. Our tongues fought with each other and my cock was throbbing, but I had to hold myself so that she wouldn't feel it and get scared off. A quick glance at the clock showed me that it was time for me to make my move. I broke the kiss and pushed Pam away from me and she took a step backwards and ended up sitting on the side of the bed. 

"We need to get back to the party." 

A glance at the clock showed Pam that she needed to buy just a little more time. "Come on," I mentally willed her to take the next step, "Do it Pam, do it," and she did. 

"I don't believe it. You are afraid of me. I thought you were kidding, but you are afraid of me." 

"Afraid? I'll show you afraid" and I leaped on the bed with her and pushed her down on her back. "You want this. I never realized it before, but you want this," and I crushed my lips down on hers. Her tongue pushed into my mouth and her arms went around my neck. I continued the kiss as I used my right hand to free my cock. Then I pressed down even harder on her mouth to occupy her as I inched her skirt up until I could see her thong out of the corner of my eye. In one quick movement I broke the kiss, rolled over on top of her and used my knees to force her legs apart. There was momentary confusion on her face at the quick turn of events and that little bit of confusion gave me the time I needed to push her thong to one side and put my cock against her pussy. Then I put my hands on her shoulders and held her pinned to the bed as I smiled down at her. 

"Here is the way it plays out Pam. Doug and Myra saw us come in here almost ten minutes ago and there hasn't been any screaming so they will testify that you led me in here if it goes to court. Paul finds out what you do while he's drunk because I will tell the world that this isn't the first time, just one of many. Your marriage and your reputation will be trashed. That's what happens if you scream and holler. The other options are to lie there and enjoy it or just lie there and accept it and when it is over only the two of us will know and you can spend the rest of your life contemplating the folly of helping a woman cheat on her husband. Either way my cock is going into your cunt," and I pushed. 

Pam gave a little grunt as I pushed inside her and she looked up at me with angry eyes. I pushed a little more inside her, "Isn't this great? You're buying Alice all kinds of time keeping me here like this. You going to tell her what we did if she asks how you kept me occupied?"  

===

"You bastard, you miserable bastard" Pam said. 

"Only when you fuck with me Pammy. The rest of the time I'm a nice guy." 

I looked down into her and I smiled as I fucked her. Almost five minutes went by with neither one of us saying a word, but as I pounded into her she began to respond a little and then I got close to my release and I picked up the pace. Pam knew what that meant. 

"Pull out" she cried, "Pull out damn it, don't cum in me, please don't cum in me. I'm not protected Rob, please don't cum in me." 

"Sorry sweetie. If you had fucked me back, if you would have put just a touch of effort into it to kind of show me you were sorry for helping Alice hang horns on me I might have pulled out." 

"Please Rob, please don't. I'll do anything, but please don't." 

"Anything?" 

"Just don't cum in me Rob, please, I'm begging you." 

"Open your mouth." 

"What?" 

Open your mouth. In your pussy or down your throat, your choice." 

"My mouth Rob, my mouth." 

I pulled out of her cunt, moved up and stuck my cock in her mouth and grabbed the back of her head and let go. When I was soft I held her in place and said, "Suck it Pammy, suck it and make it hard again. She tried to pull her head away and I said, "You said 'anything" Pammy, now suck." 

She did lick and suck on me and I did start to get hard again. I took myself out of her mouth and rolled her over and pulled her up on her knees and slammed my cock into her cunt again. 

"I can't quit until I make you cum Pammy. A matter of manly pride. Can't have any lady say I didn't give her full measure." 

I rammed into her as hard as I could and I was rewarded with some moans. I couldn't tell if she was faking it or not, but then I really didn't care. It was just a way of keeping her mind occupied while I moved on to the next step of my revenge. 

I pulled my cock out of her cunt and shoved my thumb in it to get it wet and then I went back to fucking her as I worked my thumb into her ass. 

"What are you doing?" she moaned. 

"I'm playing with your asshole while I fuck you. It gets Alice off big time when I do it. She screams and has a continuous orgasm. Come on Pammy, cum for me. Have an orgasm baby and I can quit and go out and beat the fuck out of Randy." 

She was pushing her ass back at me and moaning and then she did have an orgasm. I could tell it was a real one from the way her body trembled and that was what I had been hoping for. While her mind and body were busy with that climax I pulled my cock out of her cunt, lined it up with her asshole and gave a mighty shove. She cried out and then buried her head in a pillow to muffle the noise. I think she still had enough presence of mind to know that she didn't want to make a lot of noise and cause someone to come looking. I held her hips as I pounded into her and when it was time I said, "Here it comes Pammy. Want this load in your mouth too?" 

She mumbled something into the pillow and I said, "Somehow I thought not" and I let my load go. When my cock was limp I said, "Thanks Pam. Maybe we can do it again sometime. Just give me a call when you are ready" and I got up and left the room leaving her sprawled out on the bed. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I needed luck for what I wanted to do next. I didn't see Alice or Randy when I came out of the bedroom. I saw Myra watching and I took out a hankie and wiped the imaginary lipstick off my mouth, smiled and winked at her and went through the house looking for Alice and Randy. They were nowhere to be found so I guessed that my luck was holding. I headed for the side street and my car. I saw Randy's car still parked up the street and I opened the truck of my car and got out the tire iron. With my lights off I pulled up just behind Randy's left rear quarter and quietly got out of the car. Through the rear window I saw a foot wearing a high heel kicking in the air just before I caved the window in with the tire iron and then I took out both windows on the driver's side, walked back to my car and drove off. I hoped that the sudden appearance of the rear window on the seat with them caused Alice and Randy to have heart attacks. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I walked in the house Lance was asleep on the couch and the TV was showing a blue screen. I ejected the tape from the VCR and saw that it was from Blockbuster and I made a mental note to see that it got back to them and then I shut off the TV. I looked down at my sleeping son and I almost felt sorry for him. I could understand his having raging hormones and the way Alice said, "I was his birthday present when he turned eighteen" led me to believe she seduced him and not the other way around. One time I might have been able to live with, but every Thursday night and any time I was away from the house for more than a couple of hours? In his own vernacular - NOT! 

I went around the house and made sure that all the doors and windows were locked. I opened the front door and then I went back to the couch, grabbed Lance by both ankles, pulled him off the couch and started dragging him toward the front door. When he came off the couch his head smacked down on the floor and he woke up. His head was just starting to clear as we reached the front porch and then his head banged on every step as I drug him down to the sidewalk. I let go of his ankles and he sat up shaking his head and I looked down at him. 

"You don't live here any more. Go find your mother, she doesn't live here any more either. Maybe the two of you can find a place where you won't be stuck with only having Thursday night to fuck each other. Now get off my property." 

I went back into the house and locked the door behind me. 

I was too keyed up to go to sleep so I was filling trash bags with Lance and Alice's clothes and other belongings and tossing them out into the front yard when the phone rang. 

"Rob? What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you take off and leave me at Paul and Pam's?" 

"You weren't at Paul and Pam's when I left Alice, you were on the back seat of Randy's car and I thought that caving in his windows would give you some idea of how I felt about that." 

"Come and get me Rob and we can go home and talk about it." 

"You don't have a home to go to Alice. I'll tell you the same thing I told Lance when I threw him out of the house tonight. Maybe the two of you can find a place together where you can have each other more than just on Thursday nights and when I'm out of the house for more than a couple of hours. Maybe you can move in with Doug or Randy. They seem to like what you have and you seem to like giving it to them." 

"Please Rob, we can talk about this. Just come and get me honey, please?" 

"Forget it Alice. I'm bagging up your shit in trash bags and tossing them out on the front lawn. Tuesday is trash pickup day and anything still on the lawn goes out on the curb with the trashcans. I wouldn't fight the divorce if I were you unless you want your whole family and everybody in town to know about you and Lance because it will damned sure be part of the divorce proceeding if you fight me." 

I hung up the phone and went back to filling trash bags. Report_Story
