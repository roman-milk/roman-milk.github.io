 THE END OF a summer's day; Tuesday night and the place was heaving -- Tourists mostly. July sunshine had driven a lot of people to the coast and it seemed like all of them and more were crammed into the pub. Three of us worked the bar while two others scurried about clearing glasses, plates, cutlery, and all manner of detritus from tables that were in great demand. During summer most of the customers preferred to be outside where a cordon of chrome posts and dark blue rope was set aside on the pavement. Wooden tables, chairs, and benches had been set up so patrons could drink, eat, chat, and smoke. Despite the rush on my side, busy as I was, I saw her and recognised her. Two years and three hundred miles made no odds. 

 Miss McCready, as I'd known her then, was the crush of the school: at least the male half all fancied her, but there were probably a few females who'd wanted the Celtic princess too. The exception may have been Kevin Wardle, who now headlines as Glorious GloriaGoGo in cabaret clubs in Gran Canaria, so hardly counts. 

 I pulled pints, poured gin, and served cider but kept Miss McCready in sight. If she recognised me I'd speak to her, I thought. If she didn't connect me to the school - and let's face it why would she, one dickhead student out of how many? -- If she recognised me I'd speak to her, but I lacked the nerve to approach her outright. What if she just stared at me blankly and didn't recall me at all? I cringed inwardly at the thought. 

 As a bulbous woman, complexion florid from too much sun and alcohol, took her half of lager and pint of Bishop's Finger, Miss McCready stepped neatly into her place. Three of us working behind the bar, but somehow fate had decreed I was to serve her. She opened her mouth to speak and then paused. I saw her eyes narrow with the internal struggle -- She'd recognised me but couldn't place me. Then I saw the penny drop. 

 "My God!" she blurted. "Hang on... don't tell me—" 

 The Welsh vowels sounded strange; I remembered how exotic her accent had seemed to us schoolboys in the north of England when Miss McCready taught us grammar. She closed her eyes and tilted her head to one side; an endearing gesture but, as smitten as I had been -- and still was if truth be told -- the King's Arms was too busy for her to be recollecting past students. A large man in a ridiculous shirt shuffled impatiently. I nodded at the gent and he swooped on the opportunity. 

 "—Victor... Victor... Bowring!" Miss McCready beamed when the impatient man, having paid - no tip - for his drink moved away from the bar. 

 Surprised she'd placed me I nodded, my face colouring as I blushed. 

 She laughed, cheeks dimpling while her eyes sparkled. Speechless I stared at her, caught in a quick memory of classroom noises and school smells. She's so sexy, sexy and beautiful, I thought; more lovely than I remembered. Of course I'd never dare to articulate those thoughts. Not to her face. 

 "Soda and lime," Miss McCready said, snapping my reverie, I noticed a hint of a teasing expression on her face. She was aware of my discomfort. "Something refreshing; nothing alcoholic, it's been a hard afternoon browsing in shops." I turned to the task in hand. "How come you're working here?" Miss McCready added. 

 "I'm in uni down here. I'm doing this for a little cash." 

 "And I suppose it keeps you out of trouble." Again I saw the mischief sparkle while a grin twitched the corners of her mouth. The woman knew I'd never been one of the wild kids in school. 

 "Sixty-five pence, please, Miss McCready" I said, placing her drink on the bar top. 

 She laughed again. "Stop with the 'Miss McCready'. ... Please. It makes me sound so old. You're a grown-up now. We're out of school. Call me Rosalinde... or Roz, I don't mind." She handed me three coins and sipped at her drink. The ice tinkled against the side of the glass while Rosalinde regarded me over the rim. "What time do you finish?" she asked. 

 "I finish at ten," I replied. Then I saw Chris, the impatient manager, looking across at me. My stomach slid with concern; Rosalinde was holding up traffic. 

 "I'll wait for you outside at ten? We could catch up?" 

 I nodded agreement, distracted by Chris's stare. It wasn't until Rosalinde moved from the bar and walked outside that I realised fully what she'd said. 

 "Yes, sir?" I said to the young guy in a pink t-shirt who replaced Rosalinde in front of me. I took a glance at the clock while pulling his three pint order. The lovely Miss Rosalinde McCready was going to wait for me after work! There was an hour-and-a-half until ten o'clock. Ninety minutes of my shift remained. I felt a slide of anticipation and a pit of fear in my stomach. 

 "Message for you," said Paul a few minutes later. The pot man leered at me through his grey beard. "Bird outside said she'd see you at ten." He jerked his face towards the door. "Bit of a looker..." He mimed an hour-glass figure with his hands. "Pretty face. Big..." he paused, "...smile. Nice jugs too," he added crudely and smirked. "If you can't handle it, son, pass her my way." Paul saw Chris looking and scurried off chuckling at his own wit. 

 The knot in my stomach tightened. Paul was right. I could never handle a woman like Rosalinde. 

                                        2 

             Yeah... I like it when the girls stop by in the summer.         Do you remember, do you remember... when we met... that summer? 

  [/images/illustratedstories/2010/2010_09/geronimoappleby_thenicebloke02.jpg] 

 

 I LEFT THE PUB a little late at just gone five-past the hour. The timid side of me, which always had the greater influence and preferred the soft option, entertained the notion that Rosalinde would have another offer and wouldn't be waiting. After all, why would she want to spend any time with a shy kid ten years her junior? Especially on a summer's evening in Brighton. 

 But there she was, waiting. I felt the jolt when I saw her standing prettily in front of the chalk-board menu that showed today's lunch specials - the oddly named Moo Pie had been popular. When she saw me, Rosalinde smiled - a genuine smile of pleasure that surprised me with its warmth. In the few seconds between seeing her and speaking I drank in Rosalinde's loveliness. From the crown of her jet black hair - which she wore longer than the bobbed style I recalled - to the tips of her painted toenails that peeped from the open-toed sandals she wore, every inch of her was gorgeous. I suddenly understood the instinct that made a dog howl all night. She'd changed clothes; the simple, straight, pale blue dress that caressed her thighs couldn't belie Rosalinde's ripe body. I wanted her but knew I wouldn't dare speak my mind. 

 "I thought you'd stood me up," Rosalinde grinned. "And on our first date too! Oh, come on, don't take me too seriously" she continued, when she saw the expression on my face and the blush burn scarlet. "I'm only teasing." 

 I cursed inwardly at my typical inability to string a coherent sentence together when faced with a pretty girl. Although... girl? This was no girl. No wonder I blushed while I stammered a self-conscious hello. 

 We walked through the Lanes towards Brighton pier. 

 Rosalinde swung her small Bench handbag while she walked. She asked: "You're not too comfortable around me are you, Vic?" 

 I glanced quickly at Rosalinde's profile; her expression was serious. "Not really," I confessed when I realised she wasn't playing with me this time. "But I'm a bit awkward around everyone really," I added in explanation. 

 "I remember you being the same at school. You were always quiet." She chuckled -- a rich sound. "Funny, it's usually the rowdy ones we remember, the quiet ones like you generally fade away, but oddly enough I do recall you. I liked you because you weren't one of the idiots." 

 I kept silent, grateful for the dimness of the narrow confines of the Lanes as my face grew hot again. 

 "Do you have a girlfriend, Vic?" Miss McCready asked. 

 "No," I muttered. I didn't tell her I'd never had a real girlfriend. "I'm not very good with girls either." 

 "Ah, I see," she responded. 

 I wondered if she did see; if she'd clicked to the fact I was a virgin. We walked in silence for a few minutes. I burned with questions for Rosalinde but was too afraid to ask. 

 Under an indigo, twilight sky, with the soothing sigh of the ocean to our left, Rosalinde and I sauntered along the promenade side of King's Road towards Hove. The closing night sky lent a chalky look to the impressive façade of the Grand Hotel, once bombed by the IRA. We continued on, still catching up on the two years since I'd left the sixth form. She gently coaxed me to reveal small facts about myself; about my course work and where I wanted to go in a career. The answers stumbled from me at first but Rosalinde's easy manner gradually loosened my tongue. 

 Rosalinde paused. "Let's go down to the beach," she said. 

 We climbed down the stone steps leading to the beach and sat on the pebbles. The eerie, skeletal remains of the old West Pier were visible just beyond the shoreline and seemed to float on the shining water. The dying light, the sound of the waves, and Rosalinde's easy company relaxed me. I breathed in the balmy night air and snuck a furtive glance at Rosalinde when I scented tobacco smoke. To my astonishment she'd lit a cigarette. 

 "Yeah," Rosalinde grinned when she saw my face. "Bad I know, but a girl has to have some vices." 

 I shrugged. "It was just a surprise. That's all. I didn't picture you smoking." 

 "I don't as a rule. Not a lot anyway, but I've been under a little pressure lately so I have an excuse. My husband—" Rosalinde fell silent. 

 Again questions burned. Back in school days I hadn't known she was married. Rosalinde was Miss McCready to us. In my head I heard the wailings of innumerable school boys lamenting at the news of a husband. 

 "Husband?" I asked quietly. 

 The woman sighed and turned her face towards me. I saw pain in her eyes and a quick fear flared inside me. Had I upset her? The waves continued their timeless roll to the shore as I waited apprehensively for Rosalinde's reaction. 

 I breathed a sigh of relief when Rosalinde eventually spoke. She stared out across the water towards the charred frame of the old pier. "I think we married too soon and too young. I think there are things to do out there." Her arm swept across the darkened horizon. "Places to see.... Life to grab." She shrugged and smoked in silence for a few seconds. "He was happy at home. Didn't see the need to travel.... He took my leaving him badly and refuses to accept the reality." 

 A red spark arced in the air as Rosalinde flicked the half-smoked butt into the sea. "That's one of the reasons I'm down here. My parents brought me here when I was young, and I thought it'd be as good a place as any to hide for a little while." 

 She looked sideways at me and I saw her smile again. "Anyway," Rosalinde continued, "enough of that. It was good to see an old face today. I'd only stopped in for a quick drink after wandering around the shops all afternoon. I could see you were busy and that that manager bloke was looking over, but I didn't want to miss out on having a chat. I was getting lonely" She sighed and then stood. "It's getting on and I suppose you're tired after work. Shall we walk on a bit and then I'll drop you at home?" 

 The soft part of me wanted to take Rosalinde and hold her. Mainly I wanted to comfort her but there was an element of sexual tension in there too. Needless to say I did nothing other than just sit and listen to the ocean; I just wasn't the type to spontaneously slide an arm around a woman's shoulder. What if she thought I was trying it on and rejected me? I'd be appalled at a misunderstanding like that but inside I was thinking that I'd be happy sit on the pebbles in front of the old pier and listen to her all night. 

 Instead we walked a little further along the beach in silence. At Hove Gardens Rosalinde stopped. There was that flash of her smile again. "Y'know," she grinned at me, "there's something I've always wanted to do but never had the courage." 

 The smile encouraged me. Up until then I thought that Rosalinde would be dropping me off at my digs and would then drive away glad to be rid of me. The impression I had was that she'd been glad to see me at first and that I reminded her of happier times, but now, finding me dull company, she'd be glad to be rid of me. 

 Perked up by her tone, I asked "What's that?" 

 Rosalinde giggled like a girl and dropped her handbag on the pebbles. Then, with one smooth motion, she lifted her dress over her head. 

 I gawped at her body, slack-jawed with surprise. She was completely bare except for her bra and sandals. I was stunned to see that Rosalinde went commando. Then, after kicking off her shoes, she reached behind and unclasped her bra; a moment later she stood there, unashamedly naked, and grinned at me. 

 A great bubble of mirth burst from her. "Look at you. It's like you've never seen a naked woman before." 

 The shock of Rosalinde stripping stunned me. Before I could recover I blurted out: "Actually no... I haven't." I heard the words as I spoke them and I stammered an explanation. "Uh..." I started. "I mean..." It was no use and I waited for either a snort of derision or high tide. I preferred the latter. 

 "I hope I'm not a disappointment... if I'm your first," Rosalinde smiled gently. 

 Before I could reply, which would have been a long time coming, she grinned at me. "Come on, Victor, get your clothes off. Let's go skinny dipping!" She wedged her clothes and bag against the wall of the groyne and turned away from me. She walked to the water's edge and her body shone under the misshapen gibbous moon that had slid into the sky to watch her. With a quick glance over her shoulder and a call of "Chicken!" Miss McCready splashed into the sea like a mermaid. 

 I hesitated, despite the surge of desire I was fearful of discovery. Come on, idiot, a voice sounded in my head. For once... just once... go for it. Take a risk. I breathed deeply, steeling my resolve and, with the image of Rosalinde cavorting in the inky water like a seal, I quickly stripped. I shoved my clothes next to hers and then, thinking to hell with the consequences, followed her into the water. 

 It was freezing. I felt my balls shrivel and my cock shrink to an acorn as the water clamped around my chest like a vice and I struggled to breathe. The weather may have been stifling but the English Channel was still cold. So cold, that once I got my breathing under control, I held fears for Rosalinde's good opinion of me when we eventually returned to shore and she saw my shrivelled appendage. 

 "Bloody freezing, isn't it?" Rosalinde called as her teeth chattered. 

 "It was your idea," I retorted, my mood buoyed despite the bitter temperature as I swam towards her bobbing head. 

 "Enjoy it while you're young," Rosalinde replied. "Time moves so fast." 

 I was too young to truly appreciate that statement. I wondered what to do. Should I swim to her and kiss her? If I kissed her and she was inclined to kiss me back, then what? The logistics confounded me. Even if I managed an erection out here in the water, what would I do with it? I was unskilled as a lover and out of my depth - both romantically and aquatically. 

 Rosalinde swam towards me. When she came to within a foot she halted and began to tread water. Her hair was plastered to her head in rat's tails that shone like oil in the moonlight. I could see her smooth, round shoulders just breaking the swell of the sea. 

 "Having fun?" she asked with a glint of devilment in her eye. "I bet you never thought you'd be swimming nude with Miss McCready, huh?" 

 Well, she had that right. If the boys could see me now! "No," I agreed. "I'd never have dreamt it." I spat salty water. 

 "I couldn't help myself. It was just too good an opportunity to let slip by." She grinned again. "Your face," she added, "when I took off my dress. It was a picture. I wish I'd had a camera!" 

 Even in those arctic depths I felt my face redden. 

 "I'm teasing again, Vic," Rosalinde said softly across the water. Perhaps she realised how sensitive I was; I'd given her enough clues. "It's too bloody cold. Had enough?" she asked. 

 Indeed I had and a few seconds later we were wading in ankle-deep water on the way back to our clothes. We both shivered in the moonlight. I did my best to hide my shrivelled shame, while Rosalinde covered her breasts with her crossed arms. She laughed when she realised the obvious -- we had nothing to dry off with. I offered her my t-shirt as a kind of towel. It was a small sacrifice to make as I watched her rub herself semi-dry. The sight of her breasts swaying and jiggling with her movements actually caused my shrivelled cock to stir. I felt a surge of panic at the prospect of full tumescence right there on the beach. What would Rosalinde think of me if I stood there with a great erection jutting in front of me? 

 Rosalinde handed me my now sodden t-shirt with a word of thanks, and was soon fully dressed. I pulled on my jeans and, despite the state of it, slid the shirt over my head. 

 We set off back towards Brighton pier, me with my shoes and socks in one hand; just as a couple strolled past, ignoring us completely. Perhaps I'd been worried about being caught skinny dipping for nothing? Even if the people had seen us and realised what we were doing would they have cared? I was beginning to catch on. 

 "What must you think of me," Rosalinde asked as we walked. ""I'm only having fun after a bad time," she added. "You were always one of the good ones, Victor, no trouble when you were in school. And everything you've said and done tonight.... Well, I still think the same. You're a nice bloke." 

 There it was: A nice bloke she called me. Dammit, the girls like bad boys, not 'a nice bloke'. 

 I could hang my tenacious virginity on the hook of that fact. 'Nice' was a label stitched firmly to my forehead; I'd always been the same, it was the way my mother raised me. My mum had such a hard life bringing me up. She worked at two jobs to give me a decent start in life; her influence shaped me and I always hated to think of being a disappointment to her. 

 So I was a nice bloke. 

 We retraced our route, with me shivering in my sodden t-shirt and Rosalinde giggling about her skinny-dipping adventure. 

 "Thanks for doing that, Vic," she said as the noise of the main pier reached us. 

 "No problem," I replied. My tone was nonchalant, but what I was thinking was really about taking Rosalinde in my arms and kissing her. 

 Of course I resisted the urge; the daring move wasn't my style. Not that I had a style. 

 As we walked back through the maze of the Lanes I thought about what was really going on in the woman's mind. Perhaps she was thinking about her husband? I wondered what he was doing that night. Was he looking for her? Had he been filled with anger at being rejected? If so, what would he think of some bloke, even a nice bloke, with his missus? I shivered, and not from the damp t-shirt. Stop being ridiculous the voice in my head muttered, and I pushed down on the paranoia. 

 I cursed inwardly as the missed opportunity wafted away like smoke in the breeze. I'd had all that time to make a move; anyone else would have swooped when we were naked in the water, but not me. 

 All too soon Rosalinde led me to the Church Street car park. She paid the fee at the machine and we found her car - a sporty red coupe. "A hairdresser's car" Paul the pot-man would've called it. Report_Story #2 

 

 ****** The Nice Bloke ****** bygeronimo_appleby© I was relieved when no jealous husband jumped out of the shadows wielding an axe. ... 

 She was a hard, aggressive driver, piloting the car like it was a missile. Rosalinde gave me a look of chagrin when music filled the car; a girlish smile, like I'd caught her eating forbidden chocolate. 

 "I like the song," she sniffed defensively as the Lite Funky Ones warbled about girls wearing Abercrombie and Fitch. "It matches the season," she added. I shrugged and smiled to show I didn't really mind. I was still weighing up the prospects of kissing Rosalinde later as she dropped me off at home. Nerves tickled my stomach with light but insistent fingers. 

 With a few directions from me, Rosalinde stopped abruptly outside the five storey Victorian edifice of my block. Once a seaside retreat for a wealthy family from London, the place had been carved up into flats that were now rented to people like me - students in need of accommodation. I was pleased with the place; its silent grandeur, like a chalk cliff face under the silver moon, looked impressive. I hoped it would impress Rosalinde enough to come in. 

 Rosalinde saved me from a moment of awkwardness. Before I could croak an invitation she said: "I've had fun, Victor." 

 I noticed the expression on her face; a veil of a smile that barely masked her melancholy. Her earlier ebullience had been washed out with the tide. I realised she was still upset about her marital situation and felt a waft of relief that I'd not bumbled in for a kiss. 

 Small compensation came when Rosalinde leaned across from her seat and pecked a kiss on my cheek. I felt the heat of her body warm me slightly through my soaking t-shirt; her hair smelled of the sea. "What are you doing tomorrow?" she asked. 

 Tomorrow! Jubilation like a burst of fireworks lit up my face in a smile. "I've got work at two. That's about it. Why?" I was eager as a puppy at the prospect of seeing her again. 

 "Do you know any good book shops? I've been going nuts trying to find one. Perhaps you have an idea?" 

 It was a perfect moment; and was probably the moment I fell in love. This was a second bite at the cherry. I decided that jaded fate had handed me a chance card, just like in the monopoly games of my childhood. 

 I did know of a place, just round the corner from where we sat as it happened. An opportunity had presented itself and I knew it. I decided to seize the day - - Carpe diem! Who dares wins and fortune favours the brave and all that.... The news about the shop was met with one of her grins. Emboldened, I asked her if she'd like to meet for breakfast. 

 To my delight, and astonishment, she agreed. "We'll make a morning of it. I'd be so glad of the company." 

 Rosalinde kissed my cheek again, said she'd see me at half-eight, and roared away as soon as I'd closed the car door. 

                                        3 

          Standin' on mama's porch, you told me it would last forever.          Oh the way you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never.                      Those were the best days of my life.

 ROSALINDE HAD BEEN PUNCTUAL. I'd been looking through my window on-and-off from eight o'clock and saw her arrive, or rather screech to a stop outside the building movie-cop style. 

 The night had been turbulent for me, tortured as I'd been by dreams of Rosalinde cavorting in the sea, her skin shining like a porpoise,. I awoke in a tangle of bed sheets at six and abandoned the notion of sleep altogether. Instead I showered, paying due diligence to the use of shower gel in all the nooks and crannies. I cleaned my teeth - twice - and then took up a sentry position at the window like a faithful Labrador. 

 "OK, breakfast." She rubbed her hands together and treated me to that infectious grin again. "I'm starving. That swim last night has made me ravenous." Her enthusiasm took me by surprise, as did her appetite when I collected two servings of bacon, sausage, two eggs, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, and toast when the pretty girl with the European accent called our number. Rosalinde was a ketchup girl, I preferred HP. "I don't usually eat this every day," Rosalinde mumbled through a mush of beans and sausage. "But I'm on my holidays." 

 I grinned back at her; the melancholy I'd sensed in her had evaporated like the morning mist. I began to relax in her company. She was so natural and down-to- earth; her vitality and zest for life quite infectious. 

 "That bookshop," I said, "is just up Church Road. I pointed vaguely as I munched toast. "I found it when I was looking for some design texts. It's brilliant. Really quirky. What are you looking for?" 

 "Poetry," she replied. "I need some inspiration for next terms set questions. And I'm looking for some stuff by Frost." 

 "I hope we find it," I said and fervently prayed to the gods that Rosalinde would be successful. I wanted her to have a good day. 

 "Me too," nodded Rosalinde and turned her full attention to demolishing the pile of food on her plate. Eventually, apparently sated, she dabbed a napkin delicately against her lips and stifled a belch. "Pardon me," she smirked. 

 I laughed and didn't tell her about the smear of egg yolk on her chin. I thought she'd take the joke. 

 It was a perfect morning. Another day of blue sky and sunshine, with pretty girls jogging towards the sea-front, making the most of the time before the beach filled with sunbathers and fractious children demanding ice-cream. For me it wasn't the weather that gave the day that special glow. It was Rosalinde. I spent half-an-hour just watching her as she browsed in the book shop. Just observing her surreptitiously gave me pleasure. I adored the way her lips puckered in a moue of concentration when reading synopses on dust covers, or how her eyebrows arched when she found something of especial interest. I studied the way she moved; the tilt of her head; the blue-black sheen of her hair.... 

 Then there was the darker side to my feelings, the sexual urge. Brief but lurid fantasies sprang to mind. I recalled her easy nakedness of the night before and longed to touch her breasts, to kiss her mouth, and even tongue that place between her legs.... 

 My reverie shattered when Rosalinde came to me wild-eyed and beaming. "I've found what I want." Rosalinde held up an anthology of Robert Frost's poems. "They didn't have this at Waterstones! I'll read you some if you like. Down on the beach." 

 As she turned to stride off to the cashier I called, "Roz!" 

 It was the first time I'd used her name. She turned. "What?" 

 I pointed to my own face and said, "You've got egg on your chin." I blushed yet again at teasing her. 

 Rosalinde paused; she wiped a hand across her face and examined it. Then she looked at me and gave me her smile. "You shit. You let me walk about...." And then, another first, Rosalinde touched me -- OK, it was a punch on the arm, but by my standards I was making progress. 

 We sat on the beach for an hour. Rosalinde read to me, as promised, at the water's edge. I listened to Stopping by woods in just about as an inappropriate setting as there could be for a poem about mid-winter -- under a blazing sun, with no snow or horses in sight. From there we went back up into Hove and walked along Church Road again. We drank coffee al fresco and Rosalinde scandalised me by commenting in a disparaging way as people walked past. 

 "I don't mean any of it," she grinned. "I'm just having a great time in good company." 

 Inevitably I blushed at the comment; Rosalinde laughed away my discomfit. 

 We took lunch in a small café. Nothing too heavy after the gargantuan breakfast and afterwards continued our meandering stroll. 

 Rosalinde halted outside the Albion pub. 

 "This place looks interesting," she said as she peered in through the open door. "Fancy a drink?" I hesitated since I was due at work in just over an hour. Rosalinde saw my anxiety. "Just one... maybe two?" She had me. I'd agree to anything. Since I'd bought breakfast, Rosalinde insisted on paying for the drinks. I didn't like it. The man should pay, I insisted but was poo-pooed by Roz. "Don't talk bollocks," she said indignantly. "Sit over there and I'll bring them over. The man pays indeed" she scoffed, as I skulked away chastened. 

 I sipped my pint in a mild huff. Rosalinde held her gin and tonic and swirled the contents. "So," she began, "no girlfriend?" 

 Shit! I thought, and gulped at my pint. 

 My face burned. "No. No girl. I told you, I'm not good with girls." 

 Hearing my own petulant tone angered me. Dammit, I thought, don't fuck today up. 

 "You blush a lot," Rosalinde observed. "Is it something you do, or do I make you do it?" 

 "It's something I do, yeah, but I've been worse around you," I admitted. My voice still sounded bitter in my own ears. 

 Rosalinde must have sussed she'd probed too far; her expression softened. "I don't mean to make you uncomfortable." Then came the second occasion of physical contact, more gentle than the punch; she reached across and touched my hand. "And I don't mean anything by teasing you." Rosalinde paused. "If anything," she murmured, "I tease you because I like you." 

 My thoughts boiled. Liked me? What did that mean? Did she like me as a friend? Was it a brother/sister thing? Just what did she mean by liking me? Was I just, God forbid, a nice bloke? I had no words; I just swigged my beer and went redder. 

 Rosalinde's phone rang. She checked the screen and muttered a curse. "Withheld," she explained. She cursed again when she answered. Rosalinde held a hand over the mouthpiece. "I'd better take this," she said. "It's Simon, my husband... soon to be ex-husband," she corrected quickly. "I don't know how he's got this number, but if I don't deal with it he'll just keep on pestering me." She stood and hurried to the front of the pub to take the call outside in private. She threw an 'I'm sorry' look over her shoulder and left me staring after her. 

 After my surprise at Rosalinde's dash I wondered again about Simon. If Rosalinde was hiding from him I surmised, then he couldn't be a particularly pleasant guy. How had he found her number? And, again, I wondered if he was here, looking for her. I took a contemplative swig of beer and imagined scenarios. I've always been good at imagining, it comes from all the books I read as a kid. Being an only child I had a lot of time to myself. I read books and thought a lot -- Which is probably why I'm so awkward around women. I think too much and do that over-analysing thing. 

 Rosalinde came back with a face like thunder. "My bloody mother," she said and took a deep draught of gin. "That bastard Simon conned her into giving him my number. Damn it, I'm spitting mad. He won't leave me alone. Shit!" 

 "Will he come down here?" I ventured. 

 Rosalinde, grim-faced, replied: "I wouldn't put it past him." She drained her glass and then examined it as though surprised that it was suddenly empty. "I need another one of those." 

 This time I paid. 

 "Let's make an afternoon of it," Rosalinde suggested after I'd delivered the drinks. "Blow work out. Stay with me." She looked at me, imploring me with those startling green eyes. "We need some fun." 

 "Please, Vic," she implored and touched my hand again. "I have to put on a front at work all the time. You know..." she pulled a face and said in a mocking tone: "Miss McCready, English teacher. Don't show the kids that you're human ..." She looked me in the eye and slid closer to me in her seat. This time she took both my hands in hers. I could smell her scent and my cock thickened of its own accord. "I feel so... free down here. And now I've met someone I know. ... Come on, Victor. Live a little. ... And take my mind off Simon." 

 "But..." I began. It was a half-hearted attempt; I already knew I'd not be serving drinks that afternoon and evening. Drinking yes, but not serving. "OK," I murmured. "You're on." I pushed all thoughts of psycho ex-husbands with their arrays of weaponry and superb detective skills to one side. I also dismissed work - well, almost. I did make a call to Chris and told him I was ill in bed. I could tell he didn't believe a word, but there was nothing he could do about it. 

 "Get better by tomorrow," he said gruffly and hung up. Neither Chris nor I knew that I'd never be back to work there. 

 We left the pub and collected Rosalinde's coupe from the seafront parking bay she'd left it in. She drove the thing like a kamikaze pilot and swerved and swooped though traffic with suicidal ease. 

 This time, with the sun high in the sky bathing us in benevolence, with girls in short dresses walking along the prom and the car windows open, Bryan Adams belted out the summer of '69 through the coupe's speakers. As I watched Roz drive with aggressive skill, I really did feel that these could be the best days of my life. I was in the company of a woman I'd fancied for years; I'd thrown off work -- an act I found liberating beyond belief. Bucking convention just this once was exhilarating; I felt truly alive. 

 She parked the car in the hotel car park and looked at me through shaded lenses. 

 "Drink?" she asked. 

 I nodded and grinned. Buoyed with the exuberance of my rebellion I used an expression from university drinking days. "Let's get shitfaced." 

 She laughed and reached to me and squeezed my thigh. 

 Then the afternoon descended into a blur. 

                                        4 

                  If I could offer you one tip for the future,                             Sunscreen would be it.

 I WOKE UP CONFUSED. It was dark, completely dark, and I hadn't a clue where I was. Disorientated and groggy, and with a raging thirst, I struggled to remember. There'd been the drinking with Roz but events were hazy. I recalled the start of the session - a pint in the bar of Rosalinde's hotel before we moved on into Brighton itself. More pubs, more drink. A dim recollection of a pizza in Pinocchio's and the remnants of a drunken conversation where - I groaned aloud at the recall - I'd revealed my sexual status to Rosalinde. 

 Someone moved in bed next to me. 

 "You awake?" a voice asked. 

 Despite my befuddled state, my eyes opened wide in surprise. I was in bed, naked, with Rosalinde beside me. We were in her hotel, or at least I assumed it was her room since the exact details had evaporated from memory. 

 "What? How?" I spluttered. 

 I heard her chuckle in the dark. "I suppose that means you are awake then." 

 I nodded, a pointless exercise given that the curtains were more like blackout blinds. "I'm awake." My voice was a croak. My head movement made me nauseous "But...?" 

 "Can't remember, huh?" I heard her giggle. "It's a little vague for me too, but I seem to recall you wanted to spend the night with me. Quite insistent too. It seemed a good idea at the time, so...." 

 I was appalled. The six pints of brave juice had obviously battled with my natural inclination towards the timid, and won. "Shit.... I'm sorry...." 

 "You were an animal." She said in the darkness. "The things we did together. I'm really impressed. What a lover!" 

 Nothing, I recalled none of it. I'd known a woman intimately for the first time and I remembered... nothing. 

 Then I heard a strange noise. It was Roz trying to hold in a laugh but it blurted from her. "Oh, Vic," she giggled. "You fell asleep. Almost as soon as you got into bed you were gone." 

 "I'm sorry, Roz. I shouldn't be here. I can't believe what I did. It was just drinking...." 

 I really don't mind, Vic." There was a pause before she added: "It's nice to have someone here with me." 

 There was nothing I could say. I lay there in the dark, immobile as a table. Part of me was relieved that nothing had happened. I still carried the virgin suitcase though, but at least I'd remember the event when I did, finally, lose it. 

 "There are glasses on the side and a tap in the bathroom," Rosalinde said when I told her I was thirsty. "Bring me one too will you?" 

 I lurched across the room, hands groping blindly and unsteady from the booze. I cursed when I stubbed my toe on some lurking furniture. A Light came on and I turned to see Rosalinde, hair all tousled and with swollen eyelids, smirking at me from the bed. Covering my privates with my hands in an instinctive movement, I limped towards the bathroom door. 

 "You look like shit," I said to the mess looking back at me from the mirror. "It ain't big and it ain't clever." Still in that surreal borderland between pissed and hung-over, I just grinned to myself and whispered: "And you're in bed, with Miss McCready, naked." After filling a glass and draining it with a couple of deep swallows, I refilled it and drank again. I took two full glasses back into the bedroom. With both hands full, and still with the residual brave juice within me, I strode full-frontal to Rosalinde's side of the bed. 

 "Thanks," she said and reached for the glass. The movement caused the quilt to slide down. I couldn't help but stare at her breasts. The girls just hung there in plain view. Big, round, and firm, just as Paul the pot-man from the pub had prophesised, and decorated with pebble-sized nipples and large coins of areola. My cock thickened quickly and hung at half-mast. Rosalinde couldn't fail to notice my arousal before I managed to turn away. "Get back in," she said quietly. "I just need the loo." 

 She flung the covers back and, unselfconsciously naked, padded to the bathroom. I stared at her back and buttocks as she moved. The shape and curves of her body.... I wanted her badly. I listened to the steady tinkle of her stream and imagined her sat on the seat as she pissed. The thought caused my penis to stiffen fully. I felt a strong urge to just walk in and show her my erection. I fantasised about her reaching for me, squeezing my cock in her fist before she opened her lips to fellate me.... 

 The flushing toilet brought me back to reality, and, with my erection safely hidden beneath the quilt, I watched Rosalinde walk back to the bed. The front view was just as delicious as the rear. My cock throbbed with desire as her breasts jiggled. I glanced at the trimmed triangle of her bush and almost moaned with lust. Even in that state, taut as a bowstring, I made no advances when Rosalinde slid back into bed and turned out the light. 

 I slept. The next time I woke a gap in the curtains showed it was daylight outside. Given the season that could mean the time was anywhere past 4am. The booze had worn off and I knew I was due for a killer hangover. Mine usually kicked in at midday. Right now I needed another drink of water -- probably a gallon. Throwing back the covers, and this time avoiding stubbing my toe, I took the water glass into the bathroom. My guts rebelled at the onslaught of liquid and I suddenly felt sick. I fought against the swell of nausea and gripped the sides of the sink tightly, closing my eyes and breathing deeply. 

 "Shower?" I heard Rosalinde say behind me. I opened my eyes to see her reflection in the mirror regarding me with a frown of concern. "You OK, Vic?" 

 "A bit queasy." 

 "I'm not surprised. We put some away." 

 Then it happened. I watched Rosalinde detach herself from the door jamb she'd been leaning against. Without turning I saw her reflection walk slowly towards me. I knew something was going to happen. Was it the look in her slightly slanted eyes? I thought I saw a purpose in her expression. She moved very slowly. The roll of her hips; her body; Rosalinde's nudity, and the tilt of her head.... I stood completely still, hands hot against the cold porcelain sink. I didn't want to break the spell. 

 She reached me; I could feel the heat of her against my back. I sucked in a great gulp of air when I felt her flesh press against me. Rosalinde wrapped her arms around my waist and I felt her hot breath between my shoulder blades. With her face just above my shoulder, Rosalinde stared into my eyes through the mirror, and, with a sly smirk, slowly slid her cool hand down my stomach - a lioness stalking its prey, hungry fingers relentlessly moving in, her eyes never left mine, though my own shifted back and forth from her hand to her smile...

 ****** The Nice Bloke ****** bygeronimo_appleby© Rosalinde's fingers curled around my cock. 

 My hangover was forgotten in an instant. I was suddenly huge in her fist. 

 "My, my," she murmured. "How lovely you are, Vic. Big and stiff in my hand. I'm impressed." 

 All I could manage was to swallow heavily. Then Rosalinde's hand began to move. She squeezed the root of me and slowly eased her hand up and down my length. I gripped the sink harder and groaned. 

 "Shush, baby. Just stand there and let me do it. It's OK. Let me take care of you." 

 She kissed my shoulder and stroked me quickly. The pressure of her body against my back and her insistent, squeezing fingers delighted me. Rosalinde kept her eyes locked with mine as she stared at me and urged me towards climax. 

 "You lovely boy. Show it to me. Come on, baby, my little virgin boy. Show me how much I excite you." 

 Again I gulped. The witch had me. I was powerless against this spell. Her hand moved quickly now; I was close to coming. 

 "It's..." I shuffled my feet wider apart. Rosalinde pressed her body harder against me. I could feel the pressure of her tits squashed against my back. "Fuck..." I moaned. 

 My hips convulsed as I fucked into Rosalinde's grip. Her lips danced kisses across my back and shoulders; she knew I was on the edge. 'Come for me," she murmured. 

 And come I did. It seemed like the stuff would never stop pumping from me. I slumped heavily against the thankfully robust plumbing and moaned and groaned my ecstasy as spurts of my semen spattered indiscriminately against porcelain, the tiled floor, and Rosalinde's hand. 

 After what felt like a dredging that started in my toes I was spent. Rosalinde turned me round and, to my amazement and delight, knelt on the tiles and took my cock into her mouth. I pushed my fingers into her black, tangled hair and felt her tongue move and slide around me. 

 "Now it's shower time," she grinned up at me. "And then, when we're all clean, I want you to lick me. And after I've come," she added, "I want to feel your lovely cock inside me." 

 Rosalinde pressed her toothbrush on me; I quickly cleaned my teeth and watched the hot water cascade over her body; I was eager to get at her after what she'd said and I hurriedly joined Rosalinde under the spray and, minty-breathed, kissed her. We kissed, tongues rolling and writhing. I soaped her body, lathering her breasts for a disproportionate time while I savoured their weight in my palms and licked and nibbled her tight, aroused nipples. 

 She all but dragged me to the bed after the most perfunctory, half-hearted towelling down. "Lick me," Rosalinde gasped and spread her thighs after flinging herself onto the bed on her back. 'Here." She spread her labia with her fingertips. 

 We spent nearly all that Thursday in bed. I phoned Chris and made my excuses again while Roz went to a local convenience store and bought bottled water and snacks. Fuck the job, I was fucking Rosalinde. Later on, sore but oh-so-sated, we ventured out into a balmy evening. We ate at a Spanish restaurant, holding hands over the chequered table cloth and stared at each other with lover's eyes. After a long stroll along the water's edge, we came to the place we'd swum two nights before. 

 "Those beach huts look like some kind of French fancy cakes," Roz remarked at the brightly painted shelters behind Hove Gardens. 

 "Expensive cakes," I remarked just as we arrived at the red coupe. "Those sheds go for thousands." 

 Baz Luhrmann's Class of '99 extolled the virtues of sunscreen from the car's speakers this time as Roz, with usual reckless panache, navigated the way back to the hotel. 

 A night left with Rosalinde. Tomorrow it would all be over.

 WE BREAKFASTED IN THE SAME CAFÉ but what a change between us from the previous visit It seemed Rosalinde's appetite for me now matched her ferocious demolition of that first breakfast. She touched me constantly, little, tender gestures, and I wanted to take her again so badly; even contemplating sweeping the table bare with my hand and ravishing her there in full view. 

 "What are you grinning at?" Rosalinde asked when I turned away to place our order. 

 "The bed. ... The floor. ... The shower. ... The chair. ... And I'm thinking of over the front of your car later." 

 "Victor!" She returned the grin. "How the worm has turned." She rolled her eyes. "I've created a monster!" 

 The same girl took the order and, like last time, handed over a raffle ticket. Our order number was a hundred and seventy-four. With it being later in the morning the café was in hiatus, the morning rush over but with an hour or so until lunchtime. My final meal was a bacon sandwich - HP sauce - washed down with tea. 

 I'd suggested a trip to Devil's Dyke. We needed a lull in battle. My virginity was well and truly a thing of the past, and even though I was still bursting with youthful ardour for Rosalinde, it was time for rest. A picnic in the summer sun was, in my opinion, perfect. 

 With perhaps a chance of outdoor frolics? I certainly was a changed man. 

 My shyness dispatched with my virginity, I was as confident and relaxed in Rosalinde's company as I'd ever be with a woman. She drove as fast and aggressively as ever, the windows were open, and we'd just turned to face each other to screech into each other's face - me being Danny, with Roz as Sandy from the film Grease - when our summer lovin' came to a sudden, terrifying, and violent end. 

 She saw the van too late. It was parked recklessly on the brow of the hill while the driver phoned his controller to check an address. I felt the swerve of the coupe and caught a glimpse of the shocked oval of the van driver's face as the car slid closer in a squeal of tortured tyres and a smell of burned rubber. The car caught the van a glancing blow and hurtled off the road, smashed through a wire fence, and then tumbled end-over-end. 

 Rosalinde crawled out of a smashed window and staggered away from the wreckage. I didn't. 

                                  Mid-September 

 

 I WAS LATE BACK to my studies that year. Sitting in the café, the same one I'd been in with Roz, I sipped my tea and thought back over the last eight weeks. I was lucky to be alive. The crash had cost me my spleen, a kidney, and Rosalinde. Although Roz had left me of her own free will - back to her husband as it goes. 

 The Reaper had come for me in that Sussex field, but he'd merely hovered by the gap in the fence; the technician from the ambulance kept him at bay. He'd come again as I'd lain on the butcher's block in A&amp;E, but again, he was thwarted. I spent three weeks in hospital and another four convalescing at home. I was still thin and fragile but was on the mend. I'd be scarred for the rest of my life, but could live with the physical injuries. What really hurt was something people couldn't see. 

 Roz had a change of heart. Her husband found her and she decided to give it another go. She told me at my bedside during the second week of my hospital stay. 

 "It wouldn't have worked, Vic," she said. 'You're too young to be tied down with me." 

 I had an argument to this of course, but couldn't stand up to chase her when she left. So I lay there and cried. 

 I went to the café on impulse. I hoped it would prove cathartic. As I stirred my tea the foreign girl brought my toast. I looked up at her and smiled. "Thanks," I said. 

 'Welcome," she replied. 

 She was quite a pretty thing. I felt a flicker of interest flare somewhere inside me. Maybe Roz was right. Perhaps I was too young to be tied down. I should live a little now that I had a life back. The girl's bottom swung enticingly, encased in tight blue denim jeans. 

 "Miss!" I surprised myself calling. The girl turned. There was no one else in the café. I decided to be bold. Roz would've been pleased. "I was wondering...." She tilted her head and regarded me with blue eyes. She really is cute, I thought. I hesitated a final time and then steeled myself. "Well..." I began, "would you like to go for a drink tonight?" 

 Kate stared at me for quite some time. I saw some kind of calculation going on behind her eyes. She looked wary for a moment and then made up her mind. 

 "Sure," she replied in her accented English. "You look like a nice bloke." Report_Story
