#1 

===

Greetings beloved readers, this is the first part of a five part series. I will post each chapter about a week apart. Many thanks to fellow authors and occasional collaborators Friskee_cpl who gave me notes on the story and whose stories served as a vital inspiration for this tale. 

The cabin's tiny shower was difficult to fine-tune, demanding ample patience to finesse into the comfortable spot between icy and scalding. Roy impatiently fiddled with the faucet for couple of seconds before mumbling "fuck it" and stepping under the cold water. "I'll be right out," he called to Tuli through chattering teeth. "Don't fall asleep!" Her reply came back as an indiscernible mumble over the sound of the water. Roy nodded to himself. He had no idea what she had said; he was just pleased to confirm she was still awake. 

They had got back just a few minutes ago, hot and tipsy from a long evening of drinks and dancing when she'd suggested he take a shower before bed. Guessing her request meant she intended to give him a lengthy blow-job – for he knew his wife preferred to suck a clean dick - he enthusiastically agreed. But when he caught her yawning as he pulled off his shoes, he began to worry that the hours of twirling around the dance floor and banging back rum and cokes was about to send Tuli, who was no night owl to begin with, into an untimely, non-dick- sucking sleep. 

He quickly washed his arm pits and chest before focusing careful attention on his crotch and ass. The cold water nearly shrunk his dick out of existence, but he didn't worry. Roy and Tuli had been married long enough that she had seen his equipment in all of its various modes and knew how to give it the right kind of attention to advance it from one state to the next. If she had to work a little harder tonight, well, Roy wasn't going to complain. 

As soon as he was sure he had rinsed the last of the soap from under his balls he turned off the water and reached for a towel. "You still with me?" he shouted to Tuli. 

"Yeah, I'm still with you." 

"Good, I'll be right there." 

"No rush Bubbs, I've found something to amuse myself with," she said, calling Roy by one of her ever-expanding series of nicknames for him - Bubba, Bubbulla, Bubby, etc. - all predicated on the word "Bub". (When he'd asked her why she'd merely shrugged and said "It's just fun to say".) 

His mind conjured up images of Tuli on the bed, thighs cast wide, toying with a dildo while impatiently waiting for Roy to step out of the bathroom. "What's keeping you amused in there?" he asked hopefully. 

"My little friend from cabin E." 

Oh, of course,thought Roy, the Kid from Cabin E.They had repeatedly spotted him gazing longingly at Tuli since they checked in a couple of days ago. He had become their silent mascot; a skinny, sad-eyed, ginger-haired young man on vacation with his mother, father and two sisters. He had seemed to fall into deep, unrequited love with Tuli from his first glance of her in a red halter top and tight, white shorts. Whenever they looked up he seemed to be there, sneaking glances at Tuli's full breasts and lovely round ass from the corners of his eyes or from behind various well-worn paperbacks. 

At first it had been great fun for Roy to tease Tuli about her admirer. She had rolled her eyes when Roy professed sympathy for the kid and suggested he was certainly masturbating to elaborate fantasies of her. However, late on the second day, Roy caught herlooking around for E-boy. She started dressing sexier at meal time, down-right slutty in fact. It became obvious to Roy that his wife liked the kid's attention and was getting progressively more exited by relentlessly cock teasing him. It made him a little uneasy but Tuli's little game seemed to bring the spark back into her eyes and dispel the persistent gloom that had lately taken hold of her. If that's what it took to set her mind right, Roy was willing to play along. He'd do anything for her. 

"What?" he asked feigning alarm. "You've got E-boy in the bedroom with you!?" 

"Not quite, but I think his real name might be Tom." 

"Tom? ...Why Tom?" 

"As in peepingdummy; Peeping Tom... duh." 

"What!?" he said, stepping into the doorway of the bathroom. Tuli was standing at the dresser in her lacy black panties and bra. She was turning this way and that, stretching and bending, conspicuously admiring her own body with her eyes and fingers for the benefit of her unseen observer. 

"Don't come barging in here, Bubbulla, I don't want him to see you." 

"Why not? What are you expecting to happen?" 

"I'm just having some fun." 

Roy turned off the light in the bathroom and went to the little window next to the shower. He peeked out, but couldn't see anyone loitering in the bushes or lurking behind the windows of the cabin next door. "I don't see him," he said. 

"He's in the window. Maybe you can't see him from that angle. I don't think he realizes that the light from the hall behind him makes his silhouette perfectly visible against the blinds; at least, it does from this angle." 

Roy was back in the doorway of the bathroom, looking Tuli over. Her dark, silky hair cascaded luxuriously over her tanned shoulders, her full breasts threatened to burst from her skimpy bra and her sheer panties obscured very little of her ass and pussy. Obviously she had selected her undergarments in expectation of some action with Roy after their night out. Damn she looked good. His cock began to recover from the cold shower. 

"So," said Roy. "What are you going to do here... now that you have poor 'Tom's' undivided attention?" 

"I was thinking of that myself," she said in a serious tone. "I was thinking, should I give him a good, long peek at the goods?" 

"That'd be cruel. How can any woman in his future hope to compete." 

She turned to him and smiled, scrunching up her nose in delight. "Bing, bing, bing... Right answer! Give that man a prize!" 

"When do I collect my prize, after you're done cock-teasing the kid next door?" 

"What's wrong Bubby, jealous of E-boy?" 

"Baby, you know I'm not the jealous type," he said dismissively. The pure hell of a couple of hyper-jealous, long-term girlfriends in high school and college had instilled in him contempt for that basic human emotion. He liked to think he was above such insecurities. "It's just that I've never seen you get so hot for a guy's attention... including me." 

Tuli laughed. "Oh honey, you had no clue how shamelessly I manipulated you when I was reeling you in. That kid next door is just a lark, but when I was going after you it was a full-on campaign," she laughed. "You didn't stand a fucking chance mister." With that she reached up and flicked the straps of her bra off her shoulders and turned to face the window. Bracing her arms against her hips, she looked back at herself over her right shoulder as if checking out her ass in the mirror. Roy saw that the edges of her areolas were just barely showing over the top of her bra as it slipped down her body slightly. 

"You can probably stop any time, surely that kid has jerked himself off by now," said Roy. 

"He's young. I'm sure he can get it up again." 

Back in real life, they didn't go dancing as much as Tuli would have liked and Roy found himself wondering why the hell not. Almost nothing was surer to make her horny than slipping into some sexy dress and showing off on the dance floor for a few hours. Now here she was, shining with a gloss of sweat from their long night out and trying to get some kid's rocks off from thirty feet away. 

"So, do you want to really give him a show?" Roy asked with a wickedly arched eyebrow. 

Tuli turned to him and mimicked his glare. "What do you have in mind Mr. Gilbert?" 

"I'm thinking we put on a performance for our lurking young protégé, Mrs. Gilbert." 

"What? You want to fuck me in front of the kid?" 

"Don't get an attitude with me missy, you started this." 

"I was just going to flash him some pussy." 

"Well if that's all you want to do, show him your snatch already and be done with it. He's not the only one you're driving crazy with lust." Roy pulled the towel from around his waist to exhibit his nearly erect penis. "Or would you prefer I go next door and masturbate with E-boy." 

Tuli didn't answer right away. She strolled away from Roy, away from the dresser and towards the window while lightly and absentmindedly stroking her pussy through her panties. Finally after a half minute of consideration she turned around to face Roy, who still stood in the doorway to the bathroom. 

"OK, you pervert. Let's let him watch us," she said. 

"Wow. Cool." 

Roy's mind was spinning. He'd never fucked publicly before and had no idea how to proceed with his plan. He wondered if Tuli had done anything like this. She'd told him she'd been 'very wild' back in college but she was reluctant to go into details. As a self declared 'non-jealous type' he didn't push for information even though his curiosity frequently ran wild with steamy conjecture. 

"Um... how about I come up behind you in the window?" Roy suggested. 

"Yeah. And be a little rough too. When he sees you around the resort I want him to think you're a cruel asshole and I'm your pitiful fuck-toy. I want to give him sad little looks that say, 'Oo, my pussy is sooo sore.'" 

"Jesus, Tuli," laughed Roy, nervously. 

"Come on, you're playing a part, Bubbski. Just... shut up and fuck me you cruel bastard," she said and turned back towards the window. 

Roy hesitated. How was the best way to go about this? Rush in and grab her? Lumber up slowly? Yell? Threaten? Should he go naked or with the towel? He was so horny it was hard to think. 

He opted for the towel and a slow threatening advance, striding out of the bathroom with a scowl on his face and his shoulders thrown back. Tuli was waiting with her arms casually braced against either side of the big bedroom window; just a girl standing in her lingerie, considering the night – the kind of soft-core vignette that would make Hugh Hefner smile. She saw him approaching in the reflection in the glass and turned to face him. Roy admired her acting ability as she regarded him with a look of fearful trepidation. 

"What's wrong honey?" she said meekly while sneaking him a wink. 

"Nothing a humiliating fuck up against a window won't fix," he growled. 

He noticed Tuli force back an impulse to roll her eyes at his poorly improvised dialog. It was a good thing he didn't plan on doing much talking. 

"What? No! What if someone sees?" she gasped while attempting to cower away. 

"I hope everyonesees!" he barked. "They're gonna see what it looks like when I push my fat dick into you." 

She winced convincingly as he reached up and pulled her bra down, spilling her tits into view. Her dusky nipples were erect and her skin was sown with goose- bumps. He wanted to get down and bathe her breasts with his tongue, but that didn't seem in character somehow. If he was going to dominate her for the benefit for the kid in Cabin E, he was going to have to be a little more demanding. 

"Get on your knees, you pathetic little fuck-toy." 

She complied, lowering herself onto the carpet while keeping her black-brown pupils focused on his stern eyes. He would have liked to get a bit of begging from Tuli, but he wasn't about to complain. The sooner she got his dick in her mouth the better. 

They were in silhouette to the window, perfectly situated to torture the kid with their show. Roy flicked the towel from his waist, unveiling his erection. It bobbed in her face as she looked at Roy with pretend-pleading eyes. He took the base of his shaft in hand and began slapping her, making soft fleshy smacks as he beat her across the nose, forehead and lips with his cock. He watched her fight back an urge to giggle. 

"You want this in your mouth, don't you?" 

"Please... no..." 

"You want to taste my cock... tell me!" 

"Please. If you are going to make me... at least do it where no one can see!" 

"Open your mouth slut," he ordered and grasped her neck in his left hand. Her mouth dropped open obediently. 

"Lick it," he commanded, and she did; lapping her tongue up and down along his thick, veiny shaft; tracing along the rim of his swollen glans; bathing his balls in her spit. 

"Suck it," he commanded, and she obeyed; forming her lips into a soft ring; thrusting her face onto his manhood; bobbing her head back and forth as he guided her attention with a hand clasped firmly to the back of her head. 

Tuli was good at oral; too good for right now. Roy already felt his cock beginning to tremble and jerk with the onset of his climax. His skin was growing clammy from the throbbing sensation of gathering release. But it would never do to end so quickly. The boy in Cabin E deserved more. 

"Get up," Roy ordered. 

Tuli obeyed, climbing up off the floor and looking at him with an unwavering gaze of reluctant compliance. But as she stood before him, he saw her mask slip for the briefest of seconds. Her eyes shot him her wanton "MORE!" look he knew so well. It recalled to him their first hot months together. He felt his love for his wife surge fresh within him. He wanted to smile, to sing! It was so difficult to keep his emotions off his face but he didn't want to break character; it was going so well. 

So, he slapped her. Not too hard, but enough to leave a red mark. Her eyes popped wide in genuine surprise. Her breasts began to heave with her quickened breath. 

"Take off your shit," he said, plucking at the bra that now gathered uselessly around her midsection. 

She reached behind her torso to find the clasp and unhook her brassiere. After she had let it drop she pushed her panties down her hips, letting them slide to the floor. He took a moment to regard her beautiful body. Her big tits, dark nipples and olive-skin bespoke her Mediterranean ancestry: full blooded Turkish, actually. Even though she was a third generation American – just as much as a product of North American suburbia as he - she still seemed wildly exotic to him. 

"Face the window," he commanded. 

She turned towards the window, grasping the frame with a hand on either side of the wide sheet of glass. Tuli bent forward, pushing her ass out and up and moving her feet apart so her pussy floated wet and ready before him. 

Roy leaned in and let his erection nestle into the cleft of her ass as he reached around to cup her breasts and pinch her nipples. She flexed her tight, round jogger's butt so her cheeks squeezed his shaft. He pulled her back to bring his face to the nape of her neck. Fortunately, her perfume had worn off: she smelled only of herself now. As he huffed her scent deeply, Roy clenched his teeth firmly to her skin. She shivered in delight. 

He moved up her neck, nibbling as he went. He crushed into her body from behind, pushing her forward. She moved her grip up the window frame, hanging on tightly with her sinewy arms. Tossing back her head, she submerged him in a sudden tsunami of dark, fragrant hair. He brought up a hand to contain her mane so he could continue to taste and inhale her, but once he had her long locks in his fist he felt obliged to take advantage. Pulling back on her hair, he brought his face to the side of hers and took her ear in his teeth. 

"Can you feel my cock against your ass?" 

"Yessss..." 

"I'm gonna fuck you with that cock, Mrs. Gilbert." 

"Oh God yes. Pleaaase." 

He raised his eyes briefly as he let go of her ear. Looking out the window Roy saw their watcher. He was divided into many horizontal bands and dimly visible via the diffuse light draining into his dark room from the hallway behind him. And he was watching. His outline was faint but obvious. Was his cock on his hand right now as he ogled Roy's wife; wishing it was his hand clutching her tit and twisting her nipple; wishing that it was his cock pressing against the crack of her ass? The idea of this unknown boy aching in desire for what Roy possessed brought Roy's crude lust to a boil. He wanted to make that kid suffer; make him watch as Roy fucked the pussy he so painfully and pointlessly desired. 

Roy grabbed Tuli by the back of the neck and behind her upper right thigh. She squirmed against the pressure of his strong hands. He pushed her forward, pressing her tits and the side of her face into the glass. He slipped his palm down her thigh to just above her knee and pulled her leg up so her right foot rested on the bottom of the window frame. Her pussy was left hovering open and on display for their audience of one next door. 

"Oooooo," she said. 

He slid his body against hers and dropped down to bring his cock to her wet, open-lipped sex. His rigid head slid across and along her labia, swirling in the silky slime of her pussy as she squirmed between his body and the cool, hard window. Her hips gyrated and pushed down as she begged with her body to be fucked. 

Finally, the head of his penis slipped inside; pushing her lips aside and stretching her wide. Tuli sighed and arched her back, eager for more. Roy took his time, letting his grateful cock feel each warm, wet, delicate inch as he slipped further in; pleasure leaping from each cell of his prick as it slid along the moist, yielding flesh of her intimate depths. But, seven and a half inches later, he had given her all he could give. He began to pull if from her, just as slowly. 

"Mmm!" gasped Tuli. "Oh God!" 

Roy pushed her against the window harder, mashing her breasts, abdomen and face into the glass as he began to grind a slow fuck into her from behind. She gasped and croaked as he pushed her forward. He grunted and panted as he took her. 

Roy looked up and gazed out the window. How do you like the show, kid?He thought. 

Tuli's breathing had been coming faster and shallower but suddenly it stopped entirely and she went rigid. Every muscle in her body drew taught and a low growl grew in her throat. Roy began slamming his fuck into her with deep, brutal jabs, pumping her hard as her orgasm took her. She cried out in a guttural howl as her body began to buck and quake. Roy kept her pressed against the glass, keeping her climax on full display for her fan like a specimen on a slide. 

As the rush of orgasm drained from her and she sagged against the window, Roy felt the familiar pulsating bloom of euphoria flooding through his body. He pumped her steadily with slapping thrusts, driving his cock up inside her until he knew he had crossed the threshold of when he could back off. He felt his balls begin to throb with the vanguard of his eminent flood. 

"Come on my face," croaked Tuli around her heaving breaths. But it was too late for that. 

"Wha... Oh! Oh shit," said Roy as his cock began pumping his flood up into Tuli's womb. "Ooooooh," he moaned in satisfaction and frustration. Did she really ask him to come on her face? Shit,he thought. I would've been so into that! 

"Oops. Too late," She laughed as she looked back at him over her shoulder. 

Looking forward, out through the window, Roy suddenly saw a small flame flare up behind the blinds in the bungalow across the garden. The flame touched a cigarette and briefly flashed a dim, flickering view of their audience. But Roy saw two faces looking out at them, not one. 

"Mmm. That was goooood," said Tuli. 

But Roy was thinking, Were there really two? Maybe it was a reflection. But the second outline looked different, not like a mirror image. Was it that kid? It didn't look like the kid, but the light was weird. If it wasn't him, who was it?But one thing was for sure, some one – or ones – had just watched him fuck his wife. He felt a wicked thrill jolt through his body at the idea. 

"OK Bubba. I'm going to stop being submissive here and tell you to let me put my leg down and get my fucking tits off this window."  

===

"Oh yeah, OK," said Roy. He let his spent cock flop out of Tuli and moved back. She turned from the window and stepped into his embrace. 

"Do you think our boy was watching?" asked Tuli into Roy's shoulder. 

"Someone was. I saw them." Roy said, deciding not to tell his wife that he saw two faces and neither looked like the boy. Maybe later; it was too late tonight to kick up any drama. 

"Oooo," said Tuli, her voice trilling in delight. 

"Yeah, we're pretty kinky, right?" 

Tuli nuzzled Roy aggressively as she thought of their exhibition. "You think you can go again, in bed; just for us this time?" 

"Jeez woman. You're gonna kill me." 

"You best get used to it Bubby. I'm just entering my sexual peak," she laughed. "I don't wantto fuck you to death but I will if that's what it comes to..." 

"I'm only thirty. Isn't that still too young to die?" 

"Well come here," she said. "We'll find out." With that she kissed him hungrily while pulling him towards the bed. 

If their display in the window was for the kid in cabin E, their second round of lovemaking was an intimate romp; husband and wife only; one on one. In the dark, between the sheets of the cabin's king-sized bed, they wrapped themselves in each other's bodies and began their play slowly; kissing, touching, stroking and probing. Roy struggled to summon his exhausted cock into action but Tuli was attentive enough to get, and keep, him in the game. They coupled with a pleased sigh and rode each other's bodies, swapping from position to position as their breaths became labored and panting and their bodies grew shaky from exhaustion and slick with sweat. Finally, after more than an hour of pushing skin against skin, they came together; Roy on top, buried deep within Tuli; his hands grasping her trembling ankles beside her shoulders. With a final kiss and a tired, ragged "I love you", they unwrapped themselves from each other and fell back into the wet sheets. 

"mmmgoodnightbubbsss..." said Tuli as she lapsed into immediate unconsciousness. 

But rest didn't come as easily for Roy. He sat up and looked out the window. All the lights seemed to be out in the cabin next door now. He lay back in the sheets and waited for sleep but one question continued to nag his fading thoughts... 

"Who the hell just watched me fuck my wife?"

Greetings beloved readers, this is the second of a five part series. I will post each chapter about a week apart. Many thanks to fellow authors and occasional collaborators Friskee_cpl who gave me notes on the story and whose stories served as a vital inspiration for this tale. 

* 

It was light outside when Roy woke to a soft kiss planted firmly on his sleep- soured mouth. His lids popped open to find Tuli's big, impossibly dark eyes gazing playfully at him from inches away as he blinked away the lingering confusion of his fading dream. She sat on the edge of the bed and looked down at him lovingly as he struggled to get his mental bearings in this new day. 

"Hello Tiger," She said with an oversized smile. She had already jogged, showered, dressed, brushed out her hair and applied her makeup. She was a naturally early riser, probably up since six. 

"Howdy yourself, sexy lady," he grinned at her as he scratched at the rind of dried drool that had collected on his face during the night. "How're you this morning... assuming it's still morning." 

"It is and I'm great. Last night was just what I needed, Bubbs: hot, nasty sex. I feel nineteen again!" 

Roy chose his words carefully; the subject of Tuli's past was delicate business, especially her college years. He said "And that's a good thing?" 

She looked flustered. "...Well, occasionally I miss my wild years. It's been almost ten years now, I guess they're starting to get that nostalgic glow. Don't you get that way when you think about playing Dungeons and Dragons all weekend and translating Tolkien into Klingon?" 

"Oh ha ha.ha," Roy said dryly. "Such a witty girl." 

"Well, being a little reckless last night reminded me of old times, that's all." 

It always tantalized Roy when Tuli spoke of her "wild years" but she never went into much detail. Roy didn't push for more because he knew she found the subject embarrassing. Consequently Roy had long ago resigned himself to merely stirring up vivid clouds of conjecture in his libidinous imagination: private little pornos staring his wife as the hot young slut she had been a decade ago. 

"I guess I miss the attention," she continued. "It was fun showing off for E- boy last night." 

At the mention of the kid in cabin E, Roy remembered the two faces watching them from the window next door, neither of them the boy's. Should he tell her now? Should he tell her at all? 

She made the decision for him by changing the topic. "Well, listen: I woke you up because all that dancing and screwing has left me famished this morning. Let's get some breakfast and afterwards maybe we can go back to bed." 

Roy got ready in a hurry. He was hungry too, but mostly he wanted to get Tuli back in the sack while her former sluthood still held its nostalgic glimmer. She had suggested something particularly nasty in the heat of action last night, but too late for him to act on it. He wondered if her offer to let him ejaculate on her face still stood. He sure hoped so. He didn't know why the idea aroused him so much but it did; yes it did. 

In less than ten minutes he was scrubbed, shaved and dressed. They had stepped out into the humid coast air and began to follow the pea-gravel trail to the restaurant when Tuli suddenly froze in her tracks. 

"What's wrong?" asked Roy. 

She pointed at the cabin next to theirs. "That's cabin E." 

"Yeah. So?" 

"The bedroom in our cabin is on the other side. We were showing off to someone in cabin G last night!" 

"Really? Are you sure?" he asked innocently. 

"Yeah, look. That's our living room is on this side. The bedroom is on the other side. Who the hell were we showing off to!?" 

"Jesus." For some reason the fact that he had fucked Tuli in front of some completely unknown couple aroused him. The theme had featured prominently in his dreams last night. Maybe he would fuck her in the living room after breakfast; give E-boy another chance to peek. 

"What'll we do?" 

Roy thought, but really, what could they do? "Well, I think we should just pretend nothing happened. It's not like whoever we were entertaining last night will come up and say, 'Hey I sure loved watching you two screw.' We'll just play it cool." 

They continued on to the resort's restaurant but their steps were no longer hurried. As they passed other guests, both Roy and Tuli monitored their faces for any flashes of recognition. But it was too easy to imagine a gaze held too long or a conspiratorial smile on a passing face. They both felt naked and exposed despite their clothes 

"I'd forgotten what it's like to worry that everyone's discussing your latest fuck," said Tuli in a limp voice as they paused at the threshold to the lodge. "I think I've lost my appetite." 

Roy decided he sort of liked the idea of people discussing his lovemaking with Tuli. He flashed a confident grin and pulled the door open to enter the room first. A few guests looked up to notice him in a disinterested way, but nobody nudged their neighbor or pointed surreptitiously at him from behind their menu. 

He turned to reach for Tuli's hand and she entered reluctantly, her eyes darting around, looking for any sign of recognition. As they waited for the hostess to come and seat them, Roy spotted the kid from E sitting at a large round table with his family. He wasn't looking at Roy or Tuli, he hadn't even noticed them enter apparently. His eyes were locked on a table across the room where a pretty and petite blonde was sitting with large, beefy companion. When the kid finally noticed Tuli, he scanned her up and down before turning back towards the blonde. Roy felt oddly irritated at the boy. 

After a brief appraisal, Roy decided that E-boy's new crush had nothing on his wife. For one thing, she was too skinny; no hips, smallish tits and her collar bones jutted from her upper chest like knife blades. The girl's platinum blonde hair was too short; Roy preferred Tuli's mass of lovely, dark locks to the girl's slight pixie cut. And she had too many tattoos; in addition to the collection of Celtic icons, cartoon fairies and miscellaneous lines of wisdom inked into her flesh in copperplate script, a sleeve of intertwining vines and leaves backed by multicolored stars and planets on a navy blue background ran up her left arm from her wrist to coil out across her shoulder. Roy didn't mind an odd tattoo here and there - Tuli had a nice salamander on her ankle that he liked - but he thought the blonde had rather overdone it. 

However, despite his prejudice for his wife, he had to admit the blonde was still a good looking woman. Her face was fine-boned and pretty. Her eyes were a startling light blue. Her neck was smooth and graceful. Her make-up and tight turquoise mini-dress were of a very fashionable variety of trashy. 

Roy could only see the back of the bald head of the guy she was with. He was a meaty guy with wide, muscular shoulders and tanned, leathery skin. Even from behind he seemed like he was quite a bit older than the girl. Roy was idly wondering about the couple's situation when the girl looked up, right at him. He nodded a greeting. She responded by tapping her companion's hand and pointing at Roy. As the big, bald, leathery head turned quickly around, Roy had a vision of the blonde's muscular companion launching out of his chair in a jealous, steroid-fueled rage. But the man's face only split into a big, knowing smile. 

"There they are!" he said in a booming voice. Every head turned to look at Roy and Tuli. "Come on; sit with us you crazy show-offs!" 

Tuli looked up at Roy and winced. Roy shrugged and shot her a weak grin. Unprepared for such a direct confrontation, they drifted forward to meet their fans. 

"Here, sit; sit on down," said the leathery dude as he motioned at the two empty chairs. Roy and Tuli exchanged glances, waiting for the other to invent an excuse and get them away. But as they dithered, they found themselves sucked into the two empty seats by the odd gravity of civility. They were immediately confronted with the dude's botoxed face and incredibly white teeth as he leaned over the table and rasped in a stage whisper, "That was awesome last night: hard core, man, hard fuckin' core." 

"You've got a real good body," earnestly said the blonde to Tuli. Tuli blushed through her sun-darkened skin. 

"Uh, thanks." 

"Oh, man, you both got some pretty good bodies. Most assholes around here I wouldn't want to watch fuck in a million years." 

Roy saw the chubby young couple at the next table look over, startled. 

"Hey dude, keep it on the down-low," said Roy. 

"Oh shit, sorry man." 

"Keep it on the down-low?" said Tuli to Roy. She was laughing. "Did you really just say that?" 

"Fuck Jimmy, shouldn't you at least introduce us before you start embarrassing everyone," sneered the blonde at Jimmy, although Roy noticed her eyes never left Tuli. 

Leathery Jimmy shot the blonde a cold look, but turned back to Roy with a sincere-looking smile. "The pretty ones are always a little mouthy, eh?" He laughed. "But, hey; I'm Jimmy and this is Wanda." 

"Charmed," said Wanda, smiling at Tuli. 

"I'm Roy, this is my wife, Tuli." 

"Tooley?" laughed Jimmy. "Sounds like a rap name. Tooley O.G. on the mike, yo." He guffawed at his own joke. 

"It's Turkish; short for Tülin," said Tuli slowly and without humor. "Don't make fun of it. Please." 

Roy winced. Tuli did not like having her name made fun of. As a kid, she had been a fat girl with a goofy name and Roy knew how badly those memories still stung. Although her name actually was Tuli O.G.: Tülin Oguz Gilbert - Roy resisted pointing that out. 

"Christ, Jimmy, way to piss her off," Wanda hissed. 

"See what I mean?" winked Jimmy. "Mouthy." 

"Maybe we should sit somewhere else," said Tuli. 

"No. Please don't," pleaded Wanda. Her thin fingers held Tuli's upper arm. 

"You guys are too uptight. We're at the fuckin' beach, man. It's beautiful, it's warm," he said before letting his voice drop to a conspiratorial hush. "You guys oughta smoke some ganja with us; it'd chill you out." 

Tuli and Roy looked at each other, brows arched. On the drive down to the resort they had been talking about how they had never smoked pot together. It had been so long since either of them had done it that they didn't even know anyone to buy it from anymore. "Wouldn't it be cool if we met some other couple that was willing to share," Tuli had said. Roy had agreed. Now, here they were: the answer to their daydreams as played by a couple of loud, over-maintained assholes. Roy appreciated the irony... or whatever it was. 

Roy and Tuli nodded to each other and turned to their companions. "I think we'd be interested in that," said Roy. 

"Awesome, I knew you guys would party. Besides, we owe you one, man." 

Roy and Tuli waited for their orders while they watched Jimmy and Wanda eat. Around mouthfuls of eggs and hash-browns, Jimmy waxed evangelical on weight training while Roy nodded along mutely. The women sat close to each other; every word from Tuli's mouth seemed to transfix Wanda. When Tuli mentioned she taught math, Wanda reacted with awe. 

"Wow. I just don't get math at all," she said. "You must be, like, totally smart." 

"It's only seventh and eighth grade algebra and pre-algebra: nothing special." 

"Fuck. Algebra? Shit, it's all magic to me," she said shaking her head and absently stroking Tuli's forearm. 

Jimmy and Wanda finished their breakfast just as Roy's omelet and Tuli's fruit platter arrived. Wanda seemed willing to remain seated and watch Tuli eat, but Jimmy announced he had to get back to their cabin to "take a dump". He stood, motioning for Wanda to follow him. He promised they would drop by Roy and Tuli's cabin in about an hour. "With the weed," he mouthed silently. 

"We're gonna pay you back for that show!" said Jimmy across the restaurant before he walked out. Tuli sighed and her tension visibly faded away. 

"What do you think he means when he said he'd pay us back?" she asked Roy as they finished their coffee. 

"Get us high," said Roy. "I assumed." 

"Hmm," said Tuli. "Probably." 

"Why? What do you think he meant?" 

Tuli shrugged. "Who knows with that meathead?" 

Roy laughed. "What the hell does she see in him?" 

Tuli didn't respond. She just sat and idly jabbed a slice of mango with her fork. Roy looked into her face and saw that her eyes that seemed both perceptive and vacant, as if focused entirely inward: anticipating moves, considering options, looking for openings. He called it her "chess face". She was such a talented and merciless chess player that Roy refused to play her anymore, preferring to let her humiliate the old men in her league. The only person who could routinely beat her was her father and Roy suspected she was throwing those games. 

"Well, she is a cute little thing, but she's kind of an ass herself," she finally said. 

"She sure seems to like you." 

"Yeah, she does," Tuli said. "I would have slept with her back in the day, you know." 

Roy swallowed. "Oh wow... Cool. I didn't know you were... um, bi. Back then, I mean." 

"That turns you on?" she asked. 

It was Roy's turn to shrug. "I just wish I'd known you back then." 

"No. No you really don't. I was a terrible, shallow, asshole bitch back then. Metamorphosing from an ugly, lumpy teenage dog to hot babe in a little over a year messes with your head, Bubbs; seriously. Plus, it just wasn't in me to be faithful back then. I'd be running around with other guys, you'd always be waiting for your turn." She laughed awkwardly. "This bothers you, doesn't it?" 

"You know I'm not a jealous guy. It's just that I never had a wild stage." 

"You fucked me against a window last night and now we are going to smoke pot with the sleazy couple who watched. Maybe your wild stage is just getting started?" 

A realization hit Roy like a truck. "You think Jimmy and Wanda are swingers, don't you?" 

Tuli just shrugged. Her face was blank. 

"Should we call this off?" 

"Disinvite them?" she asked. "If that's what you want to do, Roy," 

Roy opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. His bad experiences with a couple hyper-jealous girlfriends had instilled in him a deep aversion to the notion of jealousy but the fierce atavistic panic tearing through him colored every response that came to mind. Fortunately, the waitress showed up and kept him from blurting out anything regrettable. He signed for their meal, tipped the girl and walked Tuli silently out of the restaurant and back into the warm summer morning. Both lost in thought, they walked hand in hand back towards their cabin. He could feel Tuli casting sideways glances at him, trying to read his thoughts through his face. He tried to stay frosty, but he knew he must look panicked. 

"You OK, Bubbs?" she asked. 

"I'm just... It's... I mean... Are you actually suggesting we..." 

"I didn't suggest anything Roy." 

"Have you ever... um..." Roy's trailed off, unsure of what he was trying to ask. 

"What? Fucked someone who isn't you?" she asked sarcastically. "Yes Roy. Lots." 

"That's not the..." 

"Uh oh. Someone's feeling jealous," she goaded him playfully. "My sweet Bubbulla is a mere mortal after all." 

"No... well, yes... a little. Shit Tuli, are you really suggesting we..." 

"I didn't suggest anything, Roy," she repeated. "You're doing all the suggesting." 

"You don't seem reluctant or freaked out by the idea, that's all." 

"And you seemed very freaked out... for someone who doesn't feel jealousy, that is." She winked at him. 

"I'm not being jealous. I just... Would you really fuck that guy?" 

"No one's mentioned fucking anyone. Let's just see what they have in mind. There's no shame in backing off if things get too heavy." 

"What'll we say?" 

"How about, 'Sorry, but my husband isn't ready to open our marriage.'" 

"And you are?" 

"Not if you're uncomfortable with it, Roy." 

"So you're saying that, as long as I'm cool with it, you'd actually screw that 'roided out..." 

"Easy Bub, we've got company." 

They turned a corner in the path and were back at their cabin. Jimmy and Wanda were sitting on the front stoop, impatiently waiting for their new friends. 

"There're our lovebirds!" announced Jimmy. Wanda looked up from tapping a text into her phone and smiled at Tuli. 

"I thought you said you'd be by in an hour!" blurted out Roy. 

"Shit man, I couldn't wait," said Jimmy. "I wanna get you guys totally fucked up and then we're gonna pay you back." 

"So, what does that mean, 'pay us back'?" asked Tuli. 

Jimmy scrunched his face and shrugged like it was obvious, saying slowly, "I want you guys to watch as I throw a triple-X fuck into Wanda Jean here. You know, in exchange for your awesome show last night." 

Again, Wanda looked at Tuli and smiled. Tuli grinned politely as she stepped up the stoop and opened the front door for their guests. Roy choked back an instinct to shout, "Keep those people out of our cabin!" 

"And I guess we'll see what develops after that," said Jimmy as he strode inside. He winked at Tuli. 

Tuli turned to Roy who was still standing on the gravel path, just before the stoop. "Well?" she said as she reached down to him with her left hand. "Jealous yet?" 

"Are you doing this just freak me out?" demanded Roy, his voice nearly cracking from stress. 

"I'm doing it because you are always saying how you don't get jealous and after last night I thought you might be right." 

"And this is something you want to do?" 

Tuli nodded slowly as she held his gaze with hard serious eyes. 

Roy took her hand and allowed himself to be led inside. 

When he walked into their cabin's living room he saw Jimmy was already firing up an enormous spliff. His bald, leathery head looked unreal wrapped in a swirling halo of blue cannabis smoke as he handed the burning cone to Roy. Roy took it, eager for herbal relief from his furiously spinning mind. 

"You aren't wasting any time," said Roy as he began toking. 

"Don't let the muscles fool you," said Wanda. "He's a huge pot-head. He's stoned most of every day." 

"One of the advantages of owning your own business," rasped Jimmy as exhaled a huge cloud before erupting in a fit of coughing. 

"He owns, like, four health clubs," said Wanda with a significant look as she took the spliff from Roy. 

"I wished I owned a tattoo parlor, as much as she spends on getting inked." 

They fell silent for awhile as they concentrated on the business of passing around the marijuana. After only a couple of tokes Tuli began to pass on the rotation. Her interest seemed focused on Wanda's legs, exposed well up to the tops of her thighs by her short, tight dress. 

"That's really impressive. Are you going to get a sleeve of vines up your leg too?" asked Tuli as she hovered close to Wanda. Roy noticed for the first time that Wanda had the beginnings of another network of leaves and vines inked around her right ankle, reaching up the side of her calf. So far, only one of the gaps between the greenery had been filled in with its collection of colored stars on a dark blue background. 

"What kind of leaves are those?" asked Roy. 

Wanda, still holding a toke, shrugged as she passed the spliff to Jimmy. She smiled as she exhaled. She had a nice smile when she bothered to show it. 

"Someday my leg will be covered. Then I'm going to have it go up my hip and around my back to meet the vines on my shoulder, with a few stray leaves reaching around front. I made the design myself." 

"That'll be beautiful," said Tuli. Roy, however, still thought it sounded like way too much ink. 

"I told her she'd look like a fuckin' abandoned lot," laughed Jimmy.  

===

"Fuck you Jimmy," she sneered. 

"Now you're talkin'! Come here baby. Let's show these guys how Jimmy K. and Wanda Jean get freaky." 

And just like that, they got started. Jimmy stood and motioned Wanda to come to him. With a quick, coy look at Tuli and Roy, she rose and walked over. He pulled off his shirt, exposing his massive, waxed chest decorated with generic, tribal-esque tattoos. She began kissing his pierced nipples. 

"Turn around," he ordered Wanda. She did. 

Tuli scooted in closer to Roy, taking his right hand in both of hers. Roy looked at her. She winked. Her face was lively with anticipation. 

When Roy turned back to the other couple he saw Jimmy had taken the hem of Wanda's dress in his hands and was pulling it off, up over her head. It had been obvious back in the air conditioned restaurant that Wanda hadn't been wearing a bra, but they soon discovered she hadn't been wearing any panties either as her cleanly shaven vulva flashed into view. Her body was boney and straight; almost boyish except for her pussy and pert little tits. Jimmy's hands reached around and found her nipples, twisting and tugging them as he began kissing and biting along her shoulders and up the back of her neck. She sighed in pleasure as she pushed her body back against his bulk. 

His mouth descended her body along her spine, kissing each knobby vertebra as his hands massaged her front; groping and tickling across her tits, down her tight stomach and into the cleft between her legs. As she groaned in pleasure, Wanda suddenly started levitating. Her little feet raised off the floor as Jimmy's strong arms lifted her as easily as if she were carved of balsa. He rotated her upside down, still facing Roy and Tuli. She wrapped her legs around the back of his neck and reached down to brace the heels of her palms against the floor. He tightly held her hips and brought his mouth to her inverted pussy. As Jimmy began forcefully fucking Wanda with his tongue, thin rivulets of her viscous, glistening cream began seeping from her upturned vulva to ooze across the colorful Tinkerbelle tattooed on her pubis. 

"Wow," said Tuli as she squeezed Roy's hand again. 

Jimmy moved his attention forward onto her clit; rapidly flicking and swirling the tip of his tongue across and around her pink, distended bud. Wanda unwrapped her legs from behind his neck and threw them wide, accomplishing a perfect upside down split as she rigidly held herself off the floor with her thin, tremulous arms. Jimmy held her thighs to keep her steady as he drove her towards climax. Soon the un-inked expanses of her pale skin were erupting in a vivid blush and every wiry muscle along her waifish frame strained with taut urgency. Yelping out a sharp, high pitched cry, she shuddered for a few seconds and went limp, forcing Jimmy to grasp her quickly to keep her from dropping to the floor. As she panted and quivered in his massive arms, he awkwardly lowered her onto the rug like he was delivering a sack of ripe peaches. 

"Holy shit! You guys are impressive," said Tuli while clapping slowly in appreciation. 

"Finally found a use for all those years of gymnastics," said Wanda as she lay on the floor, panting for breath. 

"Well, I ain't even got started yet!" said Jimmy, smiling through a wet mask of Wanda's slime. He let the smile drop as he moved forward to stand over Wanda with his arms folded across his chest. She was pulling herself up onto her knees. "You know what I want," he said. 

Wanda began pulling at the thick leather belt and the brass buttons of his cargo shorts. Her eyes had lost the bored, bitchy cast that seemed to be her default expression and were now alive with the spark of desire. She pulled his shorts open and the front of his leopard print briefs down, spilling his cock into view. She grabbed his shaft by the base and began hungrily licking and sucking it to full erection. 

"Show them what you can do, babe," ordered Jimmy. 

Wanda began pushing him far back into her mouth. Her face was contorted in discomfort as she forced him further and further down, finally stopping when she had her nose pressed against the smoothly waxed skin at the base of his shaft. She began working his long rod of meat in and out of her throat as he groaned in appreciation. 

"Fuck that feels good," he cried. Then, looking at Roy he said, "Dude you gotta try out Wanda's throat later. It's like fuckin' heaven, man. This bitch can suck some dick!" 

Roy turned to Tuli with alarm in his eyes. The sly look she gave him made his heart race uneasily. 

However good it felt for Jimmy, the spectacle of Wanda deep-throating him wasn't as visually entertaining as the upside-down cunnilingus. Roy began to feel impatient and anxious as his mind wandered. If that asshole had offered to let Roy shove his cock down his girl's throat, what the hell was he expecting in return!? 

"OK babe, stand up and bend over," Jimmy finally ordered. Wanda complied. He got behind her and took hold of her hips, turning her a few degrees to give Tuli and Roy the best view. Slowly, he slid his cock deep into her pussy. 

"Mmmm," moaned Wanda. "Ohhh." 

"Yeaaaah. Fuck yeah!" said Jimmy. 

Roy felt Tuli's hand slide into his lap and squeeze his crotch. Her hand started blindly fussing with his fly. Holy fuck, she's trying to get us involved in this, thought Roy. He dithered, uncertain whether to push her away or go with it. He squirmed in alarm, but, reluctant to provide the sole objection to the brewing group-fuck and wildly uncomfortable with the idea of sharing Tuli with that muscle-bound asshole, ultimately he did nothing. Without his resistance or assistance, Tuli was soon slowly stroking his exposed cock as they watched Jimmy take Wanda with increasing vigor. Tuli leaned in close and breathed into Roy's ear, "Is this making you as hot as it's making me?" 

Roy was tempted to hiss, "NO", but his fully erect cock in Tuli's hand belied the impulse. 

Jimmy's loud, rhythmic slaps into Wanda increased in intensity. He grasped her on the back of the neck with his right hand and slid his other hand down her back and onto her butt. Leaving his fingers splayed out across the top of her ass, he pushed his thumb inside, prompting a livid groan from Wanda as she writhed and shook at the sensation. Redoubling his efforts, he pumped a punishing fuck into her as her knees threatened to buckle under the assault. Finally he called out, "I'm gonna come..." and Wanda dropped to her knees while turning to face him. Just in time, she caught Jimmy's flood in her mouth. After he had pumped himself dry she sat back on her haunches and swallowed his load. 

'That's... what I'm... fuckin'... talkin' about!" panted Jimmy as he stepped back and dropped his sweaty ass into the cabin's easy chair. Wanda remained on the floor, using her fingers to wipe drips and drops of cum from around her lips. 

"You wanna shot at Wanda Jean, Bro?" asked Jimmy. 

"I... uh, I don't...uh. Not that I... Um..." Roy looked at Tuli. She was smiling at him with a bemused smirk. 

"I'll take a shot at her," said Tuli. Her eyes held Roy's with a steady, unnerving gaze before turning to Wanda, who sat, suddenly happy and expectant, on the floor. 

"Whoa YEAH! Awesome! Fuckin' Awesome," cried Jimmy. "I knew your bitch went lez, man. I just fuckin' knew it. The smart ones always do." 

Roy's mouth hung open, but he said nothing. Tuli stood and kissed him lightly on the forehead. Bringing her lips to his ear, she softly whispered to him. "Remember: I'm yours," she said. Then she turned away and strutted over to Wanda. 

Tuli paused in front of where Wanda knelt on the floor. Wanda looked up at her like an acolyte awaiting a blessing, her eyes wide and full of rapture. With a salacious smile, Tuli brought her hands to her hips, slipped her thumbs into her waistband and slid her shorts and panties off her ass and down her legs in one fluid motion. Wanda leant forward, eager to bury her mouth in Tuli's muff. Tuli let her, gracefully lifting her right leg to hook it over Wanda's shoulder and pull her closer. She tossed her head back and gasped. 

"Take your shirt off, I wanna see those big titties," said Jimmy to Tuli, who, though quite bare-assed, was still wearing her blouse and bra. But Tuli ignored him as she grabbed fingerfuls of Wanda's short hair to guide her face up and down her wet slit. Wanda obeyed eagerly and redoubled her noisy and energetic attention to Tuli's clit. Tuli's whole body squirmed like a serpent as she rode the girl's face to a rapid orgasm; seizing up with a cry of release in something under two minutes. 

"Dude if you don't get your wife's tits out where I can see them then I'll have to do it," said Jimmy to Roy in an impatient whine. Blank-eyed and with his dick still out, Roy rose like a zombie from the grave and approached Tuli. She looked at him with lusty eyes through a tussled mass of black hair. 

"Come here," she said. 

Roy stepped up to her, his hands at his side, unsure what to do. 

"You going to take the rest of my clothes off?" she asked him tauntingly. 

He reached up and opened the top button on her shirt as she unhooked her leg from behind Wanda's shoulder. As Roy took hold of the next button he felt a hand on his erection, but thought little of it; Tuli grabbed at his dick all the time when they were fooling around. But when he felt lips, tongue and a faint scraping of teeth along his shaft he looked down to see Wanda sliding his manhood well back into her mouth. He whipped his head around towards Jimmy, but Jimmy just gave him a thumbs-up. He looked back to Tuli and she met his face with a deep kiss that blew away his trepidation at last. 

Tuli finally broke the kiss to step back and pull her now-unbuttoned blouse off her body. She threw it at Jimmy. The bra followed. 

"This isn't fair, Bubbs," Tuli said to Roy. "Shouldn't you take your clothes off too?" 

As Roy stripped off his shorts and a tee-shirt, Tuli pulled Wanda up and guided her over to the couch. They folded their bodies into a knot of feminine flesh as Roy approached. Confronted with the scene of them entwined, naked and kissing each other deeply, he paused to watch. They looked up at him as if seeing him for the first time. Both had hungry eyes. Tuli reached out and beckoned him forward with her index finger. 

She took his balls in hand and brought her mouth to the side of his shaft. Wanda joined her, dragging her tiny, pink tongue along the length of his cock. Soon they were slurping up and down his shaft, pausing to share a kiss or take turns running his manhood into their mouths. Roy held the backs of their heads in each hand and watched silently as the two women sucked him. He wondered to himself, why the hell have I been resisting this? 

"Get on your back, honey," said Tuli to Wanda. She nodded and obeyed, laying back and throwing her legs wide; one foot on the floor, the other hanging on the back of the couch. Tuli moved down the couch and threw a leg over the girl's face. Wanda began eating her pussy again. 

"Come here Bubby," purred Tuli to Roy as she used her grip on his dick to pull him down to the couch, between Wanda's legs. She leant down to take him into her mouth a few more times before she pulled him forward to Wanda's wet, wide- open sex. He watched with a sense of unreality as she guided his cock to Wanda's cleft and played along her lips and clit with his swollen, throbbing glans. Then, hooking a hand behind his ass, she pulled him forward, guiding her husband into Wanda Jean's hot, tight depths. As his last inch disappeared into Wanda, Tuli looked up, meeting his eye. They joined in another kiss, longer, deep and urgent. And as they kissed, Roy fucked Wanda with slow, deep thrusts. 

"I love watching you fuck Wanda," rasped Tuli, her face mere inches from his. 

"I want to watch you eat her pussy," responded Roy, surprising himself. 

Tuli seemed taken aback by the directness of his request, but she recovered quickly and beamed a sultry smile at Roy. "Are you going to let me watch you suck Jimmy's cock?" she asked. 

"Hey! Fuck that!" shouted Jimmy from several feet away as Wanda broke out into chuckles from beneath Tuli's pussy. 

But Roy's just smiled: "No way babe." 

"Typical," said Tuli with mock exasperation. "Well, I guess I'll just have to be the open minded one in this relationship." And with that, she dismounted Wanda's face and stood. Reaching down she ran her fingers around the rim of Wanda's hole as Roy's cock continued to slide in and out. "Well, come on Bubbulla. If I'm going to eat that, you're going to have to pull your dick out of it." 

Roy stood back as Tuli took Wanda's legs and pivoted her around so her feet were spread wide on the floor. Tuli cast one last hot look at Roy before sinking to her knees and kissing up the inside of Wanda's thighs. Roy sat on the couch next to Wanda and watched as his wife's tongue began running up and down Wanda's slit. 

"Mmmm," groaned Wanda as she reached over and began stroking Roy's shaft. 

Roy looked up at Jimmy, but Jimmy was too busy staring at Tuli to notice. Tuli, now on her hands and knees with her back arched, was positioned with her upturned ass aimed directly at Jimmy. He was staring at her twin holes with unseemly appetite while massaging his cock back into action. 

Roy stood and moved around Tuli, dropping down behind her and lining his cock up with her sex. He invaded her with a steady stab, initiating a lusty fuck synchronized to the movement of her face up and down Wanda's pussy. She groaned. Wanda groaned. Jimmy, his view now blocked by Roy's ass, moved over to sit down next to Wanda. She began to stroke his nearly-hard cock while they both watched Tuli eat her snatch. 

Tuli's moans grew more urgent as Roy picked up the pace and began shagging her rapidly. Her back, now shining with a gloss of sweat, writhed with the mismatched motions of her face and pelvis. Roy ran his hand down her back and felt the muscles coiling beneath her skin. His hand glided across her hard, tight ass. Without thinking, he drew his hand back and swiped a slap across her cheek. 

"Ohhhh," moaned Tuli. 

Roy spanked her again. Again she reacted with enthusiasm. He slid his hand across her crack, let his thumb drop in and slip over her dusky pucker. He thought of Jimmy pushing his thumb into Wanda's ass. Tuli croaked, "Yesss!" from within Wanda's pussy. With a steady push, Roy's thumb entered her. Inside, he could feel his cock moving; the rim of his head thrusting within her pussy, slipping past his knuckle beyond a soft, hot curtain of tender inner flesh. 

Like rough sex or sperm facials, Roy had always assumed that anal play was something some women might tolerate, but that no woman actually liked. In the throws of his misguided chivalry he had never suggested or even hinted as such depravities. But now, with Tuli squirming like a slug on a salt flat with his cock in her pussy and thumb in her ass, Roy realized how little he really understood the desires of women. 

With Tuli's tongue on her clit, Wanda soon came in a blizzard of grunted obscenities. The sight was too much for Roy. He felt his balls tighten and the skin prickle up and down his body as he began the tingling slide into release. Remembering Tuli's pledge to let him come on her face, he pulled his cock out of her. But he had waited too long. Immediately, strands of hot, milky cum erupted from his dick to splash up along Tuli's spine and splatter her ass with dripping rivulets of sperm. 

"Whoa! Money shot," laughed Jimmy. 

His lust immediately dissipated by his orgasm, Roy found himself in an unwanted moment of clarity. He saw Jimmy, with his newly hard prick in Wanda's hand, and Tuli, on her hands and knees in front of them. Roy knew what was coming and he had no basis to object. 

"Why don't you clean Tooley off, WJ?" suggested Jimmy to Wanda. Her limbs shaky from her orgasm, she moved off the couch. She crawled around Tuli to crouch behind her and begin licking Roy's goo from her flesh. Jimmy scooted over in front of Tuli so that his cock bobbed in her face. He laced his fingers into her hair and pulled her forward. Without a hint of resistance, she took Jimmy's cock into her mouth. 

"You like that, don't'cha, bitch?" said Jimmy to Tuli as she ran her lips up and down his shaft. "I've seen how Roy fucks you. You like a little abuse, huh? You like being treated like a cheap piece of fuck-meat, right?" 

Roy felt the bottom fall out of his stomach. 

"Unhng Ewwh," said Tuli around Jimmy's cock. 

Wanda had licked Tuli's skin clean, so Jimmy summoned her back to the couch. She sat next to him and looked down to watch Tuli frantically slurping up and down along Jimmy's shaft. Jimmy pulled Tuli's head back with a fistful of hair. She looked up at both of them with wild eyes. 

"Get up, fuckmeat," he said. 

"Make me, asshole," she replied. 

Jimmy laughed at her defiance. Standing, he grabbed her by the back of the neck and lifted her to her feet. Then he took her arms and pulled them behind her back. 

"Hey, pass me my belt, bro," said Jimmy to Roy. Tuli looked at him through her cloud of disheveled hair, smiled and winked. Feeling ill, Roy handed Jimmy the belt. 

With her forearms firmly clutched together behind her back in his left hand, Jimmy looped the belt in his right. "I'll teach you to sass me, bitch." 

"Fuck you," she said. 

Jimmy brought the belt across Tuli's bare ass with a whoosh and a smack. A sharp gasp escaped her as she jumped. Roy saw a pink welt rise across her perfect rump. 

"Let me know when you start, faggot," she said. 

Jimmy struck her again, swinging the belt harder, producing a louder slap. Tuli bit back a pained gasp. 

Jimmy turned to Roy and said conversationally, "If we knew we'd meet a couple as freaky as you guys, we would have brought some accessories. But we'll just have to improvise." Turning to Wanda he said, "Pinch her nipples Wanda: hard." 

Wanda, standing close and watching with rapturous eyes, took Tuli's full breasts in her hands and seized both nipples between her thumbs and forefingers. Even from where he sat, it was obvious to Roy she didn't go easy on Tuli. She squeezed until the ropey muscles of her forearms stood out; then she twisted. 

"Uhhnggg...," gasped Tuli as she squirmed under the pressure. Jimmy smacked her across the ass again. "Fuck!" she grunted. 

Roy stood. It was time to put a stop to this. But Tuli quickly shot him a "stand down" glare that put him back in his seat. As he lowered himself back into his chair, Jimmy hit Tuli across the ass again. 

As Wanda switched from squeezing Tuli's nipples to biting them, Jimmy began binding Tuli's forearms together with his belt. He spanked her one last time with a loud, cupped-palm swat before he pushed his hands between her legs and pried them apart; forcing her to stand with her feet placed wide, arms bound tightly behind her. 

"You're in for a real treat you fucking cunt," Jimmy growled at her. 

"Whatever, you piece of shit." 

Jimmy laughed again. He looked to Roy, seeking to share his amusement, but he found no joy in Roy's face. "Hey, you're not gonna freak out, are you bro?" 

Tuli whipped her head around to regard him. Her forehead was beaded with sweat. Her nipples looked red and raw. Her eyes sparkled with lust while her brows knitted into a silent plea: please let this continue. 

"I'm cool," he said weakly. Tuli smiled her thanks to him. 

"Did you hear him? He's cool," repeated Jimmy into Tuli's ear. "He'll let me abuse you all fucking day and he won't lift a finger 'cause he knows you deserve it. You're fucked, bitch. And I'm just getting' started." 

"If there's something you're gonna do, just shut up and fucking do it," she said around her ragged gasps for breath, adding for good measure: "You goddamned pussy!"  

===

Jimmy laughed and shook his head in disbelief as he got to his knees behind Tuli. Roy saw her suck in her breath at the sensation of Jimmy's tongue sliding down the crack of her ass. Wanda released her nipples and began moving down Tuli's body too; settling into her pussy as Jimmy ravenously ate her ass. Tuli's entire body went rigid at the feel of the two tongues invading her from front and back. Her face opened into an expression of sublime pleasure as she threw her head back and cried out in truncated sounds of animal ecstasy. 

It was an odd tableau: Tuli standing with busy faces buried between her legs from the front and back; every muscle rigid with pleasure; her ribs straining against her skin; perspiration pouring down her face, chest and abdomen; her head hanging back so her mass of sable hair danced inches above Jimmy's bald scalp; her eyes focused unseeing on the ceiling, blinded by bliss. Roy felt his cock stir in his lap. He reached down and felt that it was halfway hard. Taking it in hand, he began stroking it towards fullness. 

He saw that Jimmy was being quite thorough with Tuli's ass. He invaded her with his fingers to spread her wide for his probing tongue. He reached forward to smear generous trails of slime from Tuli's pussy up around and into her ass. When Jimmy began to get back to his feet behind her, Roy knew what was coming next. Feeling nauseous but aroused, he leant forward to watch. 

"You ready to get fucked in the ass, you worthless slut?" 

"I.... Ooh..." she sputtered in a shaky voice. Wanda was still lapping her pussy and sucking her clit. "Y-yesss." 

Jimmy brought his cock up and pushed it against her sphincter. She squirmed but he held her tightly with a handful of hair. 

"Just do it fucker," she barked. 

He thrust his meat forward and she cried out in a low wail as he tore into her tender guts. He bent her forward and began slowly pumping in and out of her. Wanda, feasting in her pussy, reached a sloppy sounding crescendo as she began ramming two and three fingers into her pussy from below as she flicked her clit with her tongue. 

"Oh! Ooh! Oh God, ohgod, ohmyfuckinggod..." cried Tuli as Jimmy finally opened her up enough to take his powerful fuck deep up her ass. 

His body slapped against hers as he punished her with his cock. Her breath grew ragged and shallow; her skin erupted into a profusion of goose-bumps and her head tossed in Jimmy's grip as she relinquished control of herself to the pleasure rampaging through her body. 

Jimmy let Tuli drop the floor. She squatted on her knees with her arms still tightly bound behind her back. Her mass of hair had been whipped into sweat- soaked disarray and now hung damply across her face. Beside her, Wanda held Jimmy's dick and, with a look of profound distaste, took it into her mouth. 

"Get a load of this bro. Fuckin' ATM! " called Jimmy over to Roy. Roy gave him an unenthusiastic thumb up as he stood to unbind Tuli's arms, but Jimmy waved him back. "I ain't done with her yet," he said. Tuli turned her head up, but she couldn't see anything; her face was obscured by thick, wet, dark hair. She looked like a well used slave-whore as she sat and panted blindly. 

But Roy was surprised to find he was curious what Jimmy had planned next. 

Jimmy stood and let Wanda suck him until he grew tense and shivery with the creeping approach of his second orgasm, but then he pushed her away. "Come on fuckmeat," he sighed as he picked up Tuli. Tuli didn't resist or comment as he carried her to the couch and laid her down, face up, her arms behind her back, her chest thrust out. Looking up through a gap in her hair she panted expectantly as Jimmy threw a leg over her torso and brought his dick between her tits. 

"This is something that my little Wanda Jean can't do," said Jimmy, motioning towards Wanda's little breasts. "I've been sooo fuckin' looking forward to this!" He pushed Tuli's breasts together around his cock and started pumping lustily. Wanda moved in, kissing Tuli passionately as her body shook to the force of Jimmy's tit-fuck. Roy got up, drifted closer. 

"Outta th'way Wanda!" barked Jimmy and released Tuli's tits to grasp his cock and start stroking. The first thin jet of semen hit Tuli square in the left eye. Her mouth dropped open in surprise. Jimmy's next shot hit her above the upper lip and sprayed into her mouth, back along her palette. The remaining dribbles speckled her heaving breasts. Jimmy sagged back. 

"You're up bro," said Jimmy. His body was still quaking slightly. His sculpted muscles glistened with fuck sweat. 

But Roy had been stoking his meat while watching all the previous action and he had let himself drift too far along. He came immediately. Dropping to a knee on the couch he ejaculated on Tuli's face, adding a layer atop Jimmy's as their squirming squiggling sperm slid off to soak into the couch fabric. 

"Shit," he said. "I think we're done." 

"We can keep going," said Wanda breathlessly. "Tuli and I can fool around. You guys can watch." 

"Fuck yeah! That sounds cool," said Jimmy. 

"No," said Tuli in a ragged, panting voice as she looked up through a filigreed veil of dripping strands of semen. "We should go to the beach while it's sunny." 

Relieved, Roy stepped back and dropped into the easy chair. It was over but he felt a crushing confusion bearing down on his mind body and soul. He was arroused, disgusted, repulsed and enticed all at once. He struggled to refind his breath in the room that seemed to have been sucked clear of all its oxygen. 

"Besides," said Tuli. "We'll have all night to screw around." 

"All week," correct Jimmy. "We're here 'till Sunday." 

"Yeah!" said Wanda. "Allll week." 

Tuli sat up. She looked beautiful; radiant. Her smile split her face from ear to ear even as the spunk cascaded down her visage in slow motion. Roy's heart turned a sommersault as she giggled while wiping a flow of semen from her eye. She was no longer the exhausted and increasingly burned-out middle school teacher she become, she was the Tuli he'd first met: vivacious, clever and hot. Roy felt his love and desire for her well up even as panic seemed to overwhelm him. It was good to have her back, not matter what the cost. 

"Are you still OK with all this Roy?" she asked, reading the emotional confusion in his face. 

"Yes," he said. "Anything for you Tuli."

Greetings beloved readers, this is the second of a five part series. I will post each chapter about a week apart. Many thanks to fellow authors and occasional collaborators Friskee_cpl who gave me notes on the story and whose stories served as a vital inspiration for this tale. 

* 

Roy was watching the lifeguard on his platform angrily bleat on his whistle while jabbing his finger out towards Jimmy. "One more time and I'm gonna throw you off the beach!" he yelled. 

"Like to see you try!" laughed Jimmy from out in the surf. Wanda, who he'd been holding underwater again, was splashing away, looking for her bikini top. Again. 

Up on the beach, the ginger-headed family from cabin E sat a couple of dozen feet to Roy's right. The kids, the son - "E-boy", Roy and Tuli called him - and his two sisters, laughed along at Jimmy's bullshit while the parents looked on with disapproval. The tall sister absently bit her lower lip between bouts of chuckles while her index finger dipped absent-mindedly into her bikini bottoms. Good God, thought Roy. Is she attracted to that loud-mouthed, leathery artifact?! 

Roy sighed. His thoughts once again fell onto too-fresh memories of his wife's rough anal sex with that same loud-mouthed, leathery artifact a few hours ago. He struggled to fight back the visions, but they were still too raw, arousing and repugnant all at the same time. 

"You OK Bubbs?" asked Tuli from the beach chair to his left. Her body glistened with a thick sheen of suntan lotion. Beads of sweat dotted her sizzling skin and gradually crept down along the contours of her body. 

Roy shrugged. 

"A little freaked out, maybe?" 

"Yeah, a little." 

"Want to talk about it?" 

"What's there to talk about? Except... Jesus Christ, Jimmy is such a fucking asshole." 

"Oh, Roy," she said soothingly. "Jimmy and Wanda are the perfect couple for a little vacation fling, exactly because they're so awful." 

"Oh?" 

"Well, yeah. Obviously, there's no way I'd ever leave you for him!" 

"Yeah, I guess." 

"And I know Wanda isn't your type either, even if she is cute and up for just about anything. Oh, She wants to go dancing with us tonight, by the way. I was thinking a nightclub would be a good place to go with those two. It'll be loud so we won't have to deal with their conversation," she laughed. 

Roy didn't answer as he watched Jimmy lift Wanda out of the water on his shoulders. They turned and she waved to Tuli and Roy. The surf knocked them down. 

"How long does this go on?" he asked. 

"Well, that's kinda up to you, Bubby. If you want to call this whole thing off, we'll stop it. Or you can go along with it and we'll all continue screwing each other off and on for the rest of the week." 

"It's all up to me, huh?" Somehow Roy doubted that. He was sure that Tuli had already devised a strategy to keep their little ménage a quatre on track a long as she wanted it. He couldn't see her eyes behind her sunglasses, but he knew that hard, calculating gaze was certainly brewing back there. 

"So what's your imperial decree, Bubbus Maximus?" she asked with a flourish. 

What could he do? Roy had seen the mask slip this morning. Behind the dark eyes of the woman he loved, he had seen the ravenous slut within. He was beginning to suspect that that ravenous slut was the true Tülin Oguz Gilbert. Sexually, she would always want more than Roy could physically give although Roy knew she'd do what it took to obey the letter of their vows, even if it meant fighting her appetites day in and day out. The prospect struck him as cruel; cruel like keeping a dog tied up in dusty yard or an eagle locked in a cage. 

Indeed, he had seen her inner spark start to dim lately. Her eyes and movements had grown gradually duller as she settled into a career of teaching math to indifferent thirteen year olds and a sex life that was sadly becoming predictably predictable. But the spark was back now. He had looked into her eyes after Jimmy and Wanda left following their morning tryst and had seen a feral glare that made Roy wonder if he'd relit a spark or ignited a fuse. 

"Well, I didn't say I wanted to stop," he said. "I've just never done anything like this before, and it's... instinctually hard to watch you have sex with someone else, especially you-know-fucking-who." 

"You're right. It is hard," smiled Tuli. "But you're doing great so far, Bubbs; just great." 

So far... thought Roy. Oh God. 

*** 

Later that night, Roy found himself at a night club drinking a Heineken and watching Tuli dance. She was dancing with Wanda, the two of them shaking and twirling together with big smiles and sparkling eyes as Roy watched. Jimmy was off somewhere, mingling in with a group of barely-drinking-aged college kids. Roy had to admit, he might be an asshole but Jimmy was an excellent mingler. 

Soon guys were dancing near Tuli and Wanda, moving close and cutting in. Tuli danced with several of them, her eyes lively and her body beginning to shine under a gloss of sweat. She was a good dancer, a very evocative, sensual mover. One by one her partners were quickly seduced as Tuli's sexuality radiated from her with every movement. Roy felt bad her partners; Tuli's game really was kind of cruel. Always, after a song or two, they'd lean in close to speak to her as they made a lets-get-outta-here gesture. But she'd point to Roy, who'd shake his head with a smug, sympathetic smile and show his ring finger. Game over. 

The cruel game wasn't Roy's first choice. He would have liked to dance with Tuli too, but he had made the mistake of smoking too much herb with Jimmy - - some at the cabin, some in the car on the way over, some outside in the alley with a bouncer named Glenn about five minutes ago -- and he felt waaay too stoned to try to keep up with her out on the floor. 

Tuli had shown much more restraint with Jimmy's dope, having smoked only a little and that quite a while ago. "It makes me too horny. I'd get us in trouble if I got too blotto," Tuli had said. Roy had laughed but she had insisted she wasn't kidding. Still, Roy's stoned brain had liked the idea of Tuli achieving a dangerous level of horniness. 

Roy took a good look at the guy currently dancing with Tuli. He was young, probably early twenties, with close-cropped hair and deep blue-black skin that bespoke an elemental level of African-ness unusual in America. He was dancing without a shirt, holding Tuli close as he mashed her lovely breasts against his chest in time with the music. He could see the kid push his crotch against her belly as her brought her back close after a twirl. He watched her eyebrows shoot up her forehead in pleased surprise at the firmness that greeted her. Roy felt his cock stir in his slacks as he watched his wife shamelessly lead the poor kid on. It was a cruel game, but a fun one. 

Suddenly, there was Wanda again, dance-walking out into the crowd. She tapped Tuli on the shoulder just as Roy felt a wash of beer-breath across his ear. 

"Hey, bro, let's get the fuck outta here," said Jimmy, his mouth inches away, his voice a shout straining to be heard over the pounding music. Jimmy pointed to a crowd of about a dozen college-age kids coagulating by the door. "We're gonna go party on the beach." 

Roy swung his head back around to the dance floor, but Tuli was gone. Quickly scanning the crowd, he spotted her approaching with Wanda. The shirtless guy was following behind Tuli, looking hopeful. 

"What's going on?" shouted Tuli into Roy's ear. 

"We're going down to the beach," he shouted back. 

"I don't want to go to the beach." 

"I bet you don't," said Roy, looking over her shoulder at Shirtless. 

Wanda leaned in to shout something in Tuli's ear. Roy couldn't hear what - - conversations were strictly one on one in the club. Tuli thought for a second and then nodded. She took Roy's hand and pulled him along as they followed the group outside. The drub of the music, the four beers, the cannabis and the hormonal buzz of watching Tuli arouse and repulse a long series of dance club lotharios had left Roy's mind a useless jumble. He let himself be led, grateful for the direction and uncaring of the destination. Turning around, he saw that Shirtless was still following; poor eternally hopeful Shirtless. 

"What's going on?" Roy asked as they stepped into the parking lot. He had to speak loud for the oppressive ThrubThrubThrub of the club penetrated well outside its walls. 

"We're going to smoke with Wanda and Jimmy... before they run off with those kids." 

Roy tried to think through the cobwebby haze in his brain. "I thought it made you too horny?" he asked. He thought of her on the dance floor, dripping sweat, her tits pressed up against that kid's chest, as hard, smooth and black as polished obsidian. She was already pushing her behavior into gray areas of acceptability, how far would she go if she was really stoned? Suddenly, that dangerous level of horniness she'd warned against didn't sound so awesome. 

"I haven't had any in hours. Not like you," she said, pushing him lightly and smiling a teasing grin. 

"Did I hear you ain't goin' to the beach with us?" asked Jimmy as he barged into their conversation.. 

"Yeah, you heard right," answered Tuli. She sounded suddenly exhausted as she rolled her eyes at Jimmy. 

"That's fuckin' bullshit. Come with us. Come on." 

"No." 

"Come on!" said Jimmy, employing his deepest wells of logic. 

"We want to dance," said Tuli. 

"But he ain't even been dancin' though," said Wanda, hitching a thumb at Roy. 

"I'm not going to let the whole night go by without dancing with wife. I thought we were going to be here for awhile." 

Roy saw Shirtless' face fall into a look of disappointment. He turned to mope off through the crowd of college kids buzzing around the cars at the edge of the parking lot. 

"You can dance at the beach!" offered Wanda hopefully. 

"Not really. I need to twirl. You can't twirl in sand, not really." 

"Well, I got something you can twirl on! Right here!" laughed Jimmy as he grabbed his crotch. "Am I right? Ha!" Several of the kids orbiting their conversation laughed along. 

"I just don't want to hang out with a bunch of fucking college kids." Tuli hissed. "OK?!" 

Wanda started to open her mouth. Her question - why? - was obvious on her face but just then a plump, pink skinned girl with black hair and happy, squinty eyes flounced up to hand a joint to Jimmy. 

"Thanks Ashley," he said with a grin. 

"No problem Jimmy," said Ashley with a huge smile for Jimmy and a brief but hateful squint at Tuli. 

Two young guys with heavy lidded, glassy stoner's eyes glided up next to Tuli. They brandished another joint, the taller of the two offering it to Tuli. She accepted with a kind smile. 

"You headed down the beach?" asked the shorter one. Roy watched his glassy eyes continuously drop down into Tuli's cleavage as if drawn by immutable laws of physics. 

She shook her head as she held her lungful and handed the joint to Roy. 

"You should totally come. It'll be awesome," said the taller one. 

Tuli exhaled in their faces. They blinked stupidly as the fog washed over them. "Sorry boys. I'm going to stay here and dance with my husband until I'm so horny I can't take it anymore. Then we're probably going to sneak into the bathroom to have sex in a stall." 

Roy started coughing on his toke as the two kids' mouths dropped open. 

"Well... that's, um, cool." said the tall kid. 

"Hey, Jimmy said you guys swing," said the shorter one. "We'll probably get freaky at the beach..." 

"Sorry guys, I don't fuck college kids; not since college, anyway." 

"Hey, that's cool," said the tall kid. "I dropped out last semester!" 

"And I'd be done already if I hadn't changed majors twice," said the other kid. 

Tuli laughed. "Sorry, I don't fuck morons either." 

Tuli turned to Roy, her eyes flashed a let's-get-out-of-here look. Roy was about to open his mouth to suggest they get back to dancing when voices assaulted them. 

"Fuckin' TEASE! Eat shit you cunt!" shout/slurred two men passing through the parking lot. Roy recognized them. They had both taken turns as Tuli's dance partner earlier in the evening. Apparently they'd spent the time since commiserating and drinking heavily. 

Roy struggled to summon up a snappy come-back in the gauzy mess of his mind but ended up staring blankly with his mouth hanging open. Tuli raised her right hand and flashed her middle finger at he two hecklers. "Oh fuck yoooou," she replied. 

"You had your chance, bitch." 

"If you want us now, you'll have to take us both." 

"Yeah, in the fuckin' ass!" 

They both laughed at that one, high fived. 

"Yeah, and... OW!" said one as Jimmy appeared behind them and clamped both around the backs of their necks in his powerful hands. They squirmed and pried at his fingers as he spoke. 

"Listen assholes. Tooley is a close personal friend and I can guarantee you that bitch ain't no fuckin' tease." 

"Gee, thanks a lot," said Tuli flatly. 

"Shit, let us go!" 

"Hell faggots, I fucked her ass just this morning after Roy over there fucked her pussy." 

Without thinking, Roy raised his hand and waved. The college kids were gathering around to watch. Quite a few regarded Tuli with interest. Tuli didn't seem to notice. She was watching intently as Jimmy continued to squeeze the two assholes' necks. 

"I don't fuckin' care who she's fucked. Let go of me!" said one of the men as he squirmed in Jimmy's grip. 

"Get on your fuckin' knees, assholes. You're gonna fuckin' apologize!" 

"Ow!" 

"We're sorry!" 

"Then tell her what you're sorry for," demanded Jimmy, calmly. 

"We're sorry we called you a tease." 

"Yeah. We are. Really." 

"Now tell her you realize that you were rejected because you're inferior, not because she's a tease. Tell her you're not worthy of her." 

"We're not worthy." 

"It's true. We suck. Ow." 

"What's goin' on Jimmy?" said the voice of Glenn, the bouncer Roy and Jimmy had split a joint with earlier. His huge bulk lumbered up slowly from the club at the opposite end of the parking lot. 

"Hey Glenn. These douche-bags were being assholes to one of our bitches and I was teaching them some manners." 

"OK, that's cool. But If you're gonna pound them, could you move about twenty yards to your west? I prefer you don't get too rough on property." 

"Hey, no prob Glenn." 

"Agh! Fuck!" said one of the guys still on his knees on the blacktop with Jimmy's hand squeezing his neck. 

"Shut up you pussy!" said Jimmy. He released them both with sharp, simultaneous smacks to the backs of their heads. "Now get the fuck outta here." 

Both men climbed quickly to their feet and scurried off. The college kids laughed at them and shouted insults at their backs. Wanda chucked a beer bottle which sailed wide and tinkled harmlessly against the sidewalk. 

When Roy turned to Tuli he found her looking at Jimmy with wide eyes full of dewy admiration. But when she saw Roy watching her she turned away, embarrassed. 

"Thanks Jimmy," mumbled Roy. 

Tuli walked over to hug Jimmy. Kissing him on the mouth, she said, "That was sweet Jimmy. Thanks." The college kids and Wanda started clapping. Jimmy bowed and smiled. He was blushing. Blushing like a little-league centerfielder catching an easy but crucial fly ball, thought Roy. Hero of the fucking day. 

Roy sullenly tugged Tuli's elbow. "C'mon. Let's go dance," he said. 

As Jimmy formed up a caravan to carry him and his young disciples to their party in the dunes, Tuli suggested to Roy that they go to the club they'd been to last night. It had been classier, less oppressively loud and with better music. Roy shrugged his acquiescence. They said their goodbyes and Wanda and Jimmy tried one last time to tempt them into coming along. Finally they simply agreed to meet up sometime tomorrow. 

They'd driven out with Jimmy so they began walking, cutting through town and avoiding the crowds on the boardwalk. As they walked Tuli was effervescent, joking and babbling, trying to pull Roy out of his sudden sullen mood. But Roy's moods could be stubborn. Finally Tuli sighed in frustration. "I'm sorry Jimmy manhandled those pricks instead of you, Roy, but just let it go already." 

"It's not just that. You sure seemed to like that anal fuck he gave you this morning -- which he then went and announced to everyone in earshot back in that fucking parking lot! Christ! I've never even done... that to you." 

"Well no wonder you've never fucked me in the ass, you can't even fucking say it!" said Tuli, heatedly. 

"What's that supposed to...?" 

They cut off their incipient argument as both noticed Shirtless standing about twenty feet behind them. Except, he had a shirt now; white linen, short sleeve, left unbuttoned of course. With his black slacks and dark skin he looked like a shirt and with a pair of attendant eyes floating through the night. The levitating ensemble was joined by a set of teeth as he smiled awkwardly at them. 

"Um... Good evening," he said. His voice had what sounded to Roy's American ears like a vaguely British accent. 

"Are you following us?" asked Roy. 

"Um, well, yes... your lovely wife and I had such a delightful time dancing and that large fellow with the bald head mentioned that you sometimes, um... share her with men who are of adequate quality." 

They stared at him blankly, unbelieving. 

"I assure you I am well bred and developed in my body and mind," he said, speaking increasingly rapidly. "Back in Kenya my father and older brothers are all doctors and my mother teaches law. I am studying medicine at John Hopkins and did my undergraduate studies at Oxford. And I am also in excellent health; I've had all my vaccines, I play soccer in three different leagues, I can do two hundred push-ups!" 

Tuli laughed loudly. "I bet you can!" 

Roy couldn't help but smile as the kid frantically pitched his case. He half expected him to hand over a resume and references. 

"I'm sorry," said Tuli gently with and understanding laugh. "Your timing isn't very good. My husband and I are about to have an argument, I think." 

"What's your name?" Roy asked Formerly-Shirtless. 

"Everyone calls me Mike." 

"Mike, my wife seems to think I'm a... a prude or something." 

"I never said..." 

"So you're going to help me prove her wrong," continued Roy, straining the keep his voice steady. "We're going to both make love to her, together." 

Tuli's mouth dropped open and her eyes popped wide. Mike cracked an excited smile. "Yes. I would like that. Very much, yes," he said. 

"We're staying outside of town at the Flag Pine resort. So we'll need to find a cab; unless you have someplace closer." 

Mike nodded, "I do. Very close. I was an exchange student here when I was a boy. We had a secret spot under the boardwalk. It is very near." 

"A secret make-out spot under the boardwalk!?" gushed Tuli as her smile split her face from ear to ear. "Awesome." 

Roy would have preferred to go back to the cabin's big bed where it was comfortable, but Mike's proud smile and Tuli's giddy enthusiasm won him over. Besides, how often do you get to screw your wife with some African stranger while people walk overhead? "OK. Let's see it, Mike." 

Mike beckoned them to follow him as he led them through the streets towards the boardwalk. The crowds got thicker and livelier as they neared the noise, lights and smells of the amusement piers, arcades and food kiosks. A block from the boardwalk they passed a twenty-four hour pharmacy and Roy excused himself to pop in "for some supplies". Anticipating another first with Tuli, he bought a pocket sized tube of KY. He also picked up a box of rubbers in case Mike didn't have any. He wasn't about to let the kid go bareback in Tuli; he was from Africa for fuck's sake.  

===

When Roy returned, he found Tuli and Mike intertwined against a lamp post as a few passersby tut-tutted their public miscegenation with sour looks and hard stares. Roy felt an increasingly familiar summersault in his guts as he watched his wife gleefully submit to Mike's affections. It struck him how he didn't see the tension and aggression that she'd shown when she'd been with Jimmy. Her motions were now fluid, eager, hot. He remembered what she'd said this morning: "Jimmy and Wanda are perfect for a vacation fling exactly because they're so awful." Roy looked at Mike: English accent, future doctor, open shirt exposing his two hundred push-up chest. Belatedly he saw the wisdom in what Tuli had said. Maybe Jimmy wasn't so bad after all. 

"So this is your make-out spot? It isn't as secret as I'd imagined," said Roy conversationally as he walked up to them. He resisted a sharp urge to punch Mike in the face, which was easy to do since Mike looked like he could definitely beat his ass into the ground. 

"It's not far from here," said Mike with a wide smile. Smears of Tuli's lipstick coated his face around his mouth. 

He led them down the street and into an alley. The alley was filthy and smelled of urine and garbage. They turned down another alley and followed it to short but tall stretch of chain-link fence that stretched across the back end of the passage. The fence blocked access to an old wood barrier with a few loose boards hanging by rusty nails. 

"This is new," said Mike, shaking the chain links in his hand. 

"I can't get over that," said Tuli. "Not dressed like this." 

"I can lift you over!" said Mike. "Perhaps you could get on the other side and catch her?" he suggested to Roy. 

"Sure," said Roy looking up at the fence with apprehension. 

He scrambled over with difficulty in his smooth-soled dress shoes but eventually dropped to the other side. Mike picked Tuli up around the thighs and began pushing her up over the top. As she squirmed over, her dress caught on a loose end of aluminum wire and ripped it down the front, leaving a extra six inches of jagged cleavage. 

"Well... shit!" she said as she unhooked the fabric and gracelessly lowered herself into Roy's waiting arms. 

"Thank you, Mr. Gilbert," she said as he caught her. 

"My pleasure, Mrs. Gilbert," he said as he set her on her feet. 

Mike landed beside them. "We are very close," he said. Tuli squeezed Roy's hand. Her eyes were flashing with barely restrained, infectious desire. 

One by one they squeezed through the gaps in the wood barrier and under the boardwalk. Beneath was stark blackness regularly transected by lines of bright carnival lights that leaked through the gaps in the planks. People passing overhead dripped down shadows that skittered like ghosts around the creosote soaked pilings and drifts of trash. The noises from above came down loud but muted, more felt than heard. 

"Wow. This is trippy. I'm so glad I'm stoned right now," said Tuli quietly. 

Roy wasn't. He was feeling waves of THC induced paranoia wash over him as he moved through the mind-fuck lighting. What if "Mike" was a cannibal? he thought. Did they have cannibals in Kenya? Maybe the only reason they don't was because they kicked Mike out last week? "Half Eaten Bodies Found Under Boardwalk", he imagined the tomorrow's headline reading. 

"So you were an exchange student here, huh Mike? What brought you back?" asked Roy, hoping small talk might divert Mike from the tasty temptations of succulent human flesh. 

"A friend from back then is getting married the day after tomorrow. I thought I'd come early and explore the town again," he explained. "Ah, we are here," he said suddenly. 

Roy could only see a darker area against the striped blackness. He thought he might have seen some movement, but it was hard to tell. As they drew closer Roy could see there was a concrete wall, heavily eroded but intact. It walled off section of about seven hundred square feet under the walkway back away from the beach. There was a door-less doorway that led back into the enclosed area. The ceiling was low this far back so Roy and Mike had to duck slightly as they approached. Roy could definitely see movement now. The ground seemed alive as is moved and pulsed with slow, emphatic rhythms. 

"They used to leave me in the doorway as a look-out," said Mike. "Maybe the police stopped trying to keep the kids out of here." 

"Oh... Wow." said Tuli. She was looking past Mike into the gloom of Mike's Secret Make-Out Spot; except it didn't seem particularly secret. The ground was littered with kissing, groping and screwing couples. 

"Shit, I grew up in the wrong town," said Roy. 

"It didn't used to be this crowded," said Mike. 

"Oh, I think it's great," said Tuli turning to Roy and flashing her white teeth in the murky light. She squeezed Roy's hand and urged him forward, gingerly following Mike as he picked his way through the coupling bodies underfoot. 

"Here's a good spot," announced Mike as he stopped in the center of the area. A tumbled-down brick wall rose partway to the ceiling and several slabs of rough concrete had been stacked next to it to make a rude and somewhat lopsided bench. A poked-out knot in the plank directly overhead allowed a shaft of purplish light to lance down into the space from the noisy arcade above. 

"Yeah," said Tuli breathlessly. "It is." 

Roy dithered, not knowing what to do or how to start. Deep down he suddenly wanted to leave; leave this sandy sex dungeon, leave Mike, leave this stupid boardwalk and get Tuli, alone, in bed. But what could he do? What could he say? He'd agreed to this stunt. Hell, it had been his goddamned idea. 

His attention was briefly pulled away when he saw a pale, lanky couple switching to doggie style on a blanket about two yards to his left. When he looked back Tuli and Mike's lips had met in a soul kiss directly in front of him. Then the shaft of purple light blinked out as someone stepped on the knothole in the arcade. Roy found himself suddenly in the dark, alone. 

Roy reached out and his hands found Tuli. She pivoted and pulled herself close to him. Their lips met. He felt her hands on his crotch, fumbling with his fly. His cock responded, growing earnestly as she removed his manhood and cradled it in her hand. He kissed her more urgently, encouraging her to continue. As he kissed her he felt her mouth meet his cock, her tongue wrap itself around his shaft... 

Wait a minute... thought Roy. 

Whoever had been cutting off the shaft of purple light from above moved on, permitting Roy to look and see Mike on his knees. Roy's cock was in his mouth. 

"Holy fuck Mike! What the hell?!" 

"Shhhh," came several annoyed voices. 

"I... I suppose I misunderstood your intention." 

"Fuck yeah you fucking did!" 

"Oh come on Bubby," said Tuli in a voice saturated with teasing playfulness. "Don't be such a pruuude." 

"Shhhhhhhhh!" 

"Here," said Roy as he shoved a condom packet into Tuli's palm. Put this on Mike." 

"Oooo!" said Tuli as she recognized what Roy had handed her. 

"What is it?" Said Mike. He sounded nervous, as if now expecting to be handcuffed. 

"A rubber. Remember, we're fucking her. Not each other." 

"I'm very sorry, I..." 

"SHHHHHHHHHH!" implored every other voice in the sandy sex pit. 

"Shhhh," repeated Tuli softly as she guided Mike up off his knees and onto the makeshift bench of concrete slabs. She kissed him deeply and began moving down his body, kissing his neck, chest and stomach. As she did so, her hands worked at his trousers, opening the fly and liberating his cock. The soft slurping sound of her mouth playing up and down along his shaft floated back to Roy as he lifted the hem of her short dress and pulled her thong down to her ankles. She gyrated her ass slowly and lasciviously as he reached between her thighs to pull his fingers back through her labia, around rim of her vag and along the crack of her ass. She groaned as his thumb pushed lightly at her sphincter. 

Roy dropped to a knee to bring his face to Tuli's pussy, slipping his tongue into her moist folds with hungry urgency. He lapped up and down, tracing her lips with his tongue and teasing her clit as the tip of his nose slipped into her depths. Oh God, how he loved that musky smell! He squirted a fat dollop of KY onto his fingers and brought them to Tuli's anus. As she felt the wet chill of the gel against her hot pucker she moaned around Mike's cock. 

Roy stood up and gratefully slid his cock into Tuli's pussy, washing away the shame of Mike's mouth with his wife's damp depths as he slowly entered her. He kept massaging her ass as he fucked her, pushing gently but insistently until his fingers slipped in easily. He pried at her, easing her open, getting her ready. 

Tuli was positioned with her ass in the air, bend deeply at the waist with her mouth on Mike's cock. It wasn't a tenable position, not in the loose sand under the boardwalk anyway. "How about you guys change positions," she said as she raised her face from Mike's lap. 

"But..." said Roy. He wasn't about to hand over Tuli's ass to Mike after he did all the work to get it ready. 

"I'll change position too, dummy," said Tuli, reading his mind. 

"Oh... OK." 

Roy moved to the bench and Mike stood as Tuli turned to keep her ass to Roy and face to Mike. As Roy moved he looked around him. His eyes had grown used to the dim, dusty light and he could at last see their surroundings in some detail. Everywhere he turned pale faces were turning towards him, taking a break from their passion to notice the full-breasted, long-haired brunette finally stripping off the last of her clothes before returning to her interracial double penetration. 

Roy sat and, taking Tuli's hips, pulled her to his lap. She took hold of his cock and shifted it back to line it up with her bottom. With a protracted grunt, she lowered her ass onto him. He felt her firm resistance, followed by a grudgingly yielding tightness slowly enveloping his shaft. God, it was so fucking tight. He could see the straining muscles of her slender back coil and quiver as she impaled herself on him. Her breath was quick and shallow as she worked him inside. In front of Tuli, Mike had moved in close. He was sliding his cock between her tits. 

Finally Roy was in all the way; balls deep. He began a slow grinding upwards fuck into her as she began unrolling the rubber onto Mike's penis. When she was finished she leaned back against Roy's chest while Mike sank to his knees between her thighs. She threw her legs wide and reached back to lace her fingers together behind Roy's neck. Roy could feel the tightness within Tuli become tighter as Mike's thick, hard shaft pushed into her; stretching the tender flesh taut and causing her to squirm against the mingled discomfort and pleasure. Roy could feel the hard maleness now sharing the deep delights of his wife. He could feel it moving past his manhood, bumping and banging against each other as they began using her with increasing ferocity. 

"Oh, Oh, Oh!" she panted as Mike found his rhythm and began pumping her steadily. Roy continued thrusting slowly up into her, letting the sensation of Mike's cock slamming in and out of Tuli's pussy drive him uncomfortably closer to climax. Tuli was rocking her body along with the pumping meat inside her. She huffed and puffed like a steam engine as she began to tremble. With a gasp, her breath caught in her throat and Roy felt her body grip their cocks tightly as she suddenly convulsed in pleasure with a truncated scream. 

"Wow," said a voice to his right. Roy turned his head and saw spectral silhouettes surrounding them and gathering close; tempted from their private paradises to gawk at the ménage a trios now grinding away before them. An erect cock hovered close, a few feet from Roy's head. A hand reached out to take Tuli's arm and guide her fingers to it. Tuli turned her head in surprise. Opening her mouth, she pulled the cock towards her. The crowd seemed to surge a little closer as Tuli reached out with her other hand... 

Light hit them. Cruel, white and stark; it flooded the area with what felt like a physical force. In it, the spectral bodies around them resolved themselves into ordinary skin and bones as the crowd whipped into a sudden, half naked stampede. Mike pulled out of Tuli's pussy as he stood suddenly; too suddenly it turned out, as his head bounced off the low supports and he staggered a few steps before taking off running, nude. The lights found Roy and Tuli immobile in the swirling confusion; coupled tightly together by Roy's erection clenched in Tuli's now-very-puckery sphincter. Her fingernails dug into Roy's thighs as she tried to cringe back from the twin beams of light pouring onto her naked body. 

"Who...?" she said. She was trembling. 

"Blaire Island Police," said a man's voice. "Don't move." 

"Please, we just..." said Roy, beginning to spin an excuse without having any idea of what that excuse might be. He realized three words in that there really wasn't one. 

"Yes...?" said an amused woman's voice from behind the flashlights. 

"Don't arrest us," pleaded Tuli, her voice was shaky with panic. Roy understood her fear. He couldn't imagine the school district would be very pleased if they found out one of their math teachers had been busted for public fornication. 

"We really don't like the idea of you girls bringing your tricks down here," said the man's voice. 

"Tricks?" 

"We're married." 

"Whaddya think? You believe them?" asked the man's voice. 

"Kinda," said the woman's voice. "She looks too classy for the type of working girl who'd agree to a sandy ass-fuck under the boardwalk. Plus he's going bareback. I bet Mr. and Mrs. Smith here are just trying to rekindling the romance." 

"Nice." 

"Yeah, real sweet." 

"Please, let us go... I'll do anything," said Tuli in a throaty plea. 

Roy didn't want to get arrested either, but "anything" covered a lot of ground. What was Tuli opening herself up to? How could he stop this!? He took her hands in his and squeezed. 

"Wow," said the woman cop. 

"Some chicks get off on the bribe sex," explained the man cop. 

"Fringe benefit?" 

"Not at my age, I'd have to run home for one of my blue pills. And I'm sure Terri wouldn't be too pleased if I took Viagra with me to work." 

"Anything..." Tuli said again, more slowly this time. She was writhing against Roy and pushing her ass up and down on his cock. Roy was freaked out, but also wildly and oddly aroused as she recommenced fucking him in the glare of the flashlights. "Please...," gasped Tuli. 

"Your call rookie, should we arrest them or let them off with a warning?" 

"Where's your imagination, Hank? She said she'd do anything... just look at her." 

"Christ, I told you, that's a young man's game. But thanks anyway." 

"It's not just a man's game, Hank." 

"Oh yeah. Shit Naines, I forget that you're a... um, you know. Why? You want a shot at her?" 

"I wouldn't mind a taste." 

"Fuck Naines. That's... uh...That's pretty fuckin'... You want me to leave?" 

"Naw, you can hang out. Partners don't keep secrets, right?" 

"Jesus what are you gonna do to them." 

"Oh you'll see." 

"Oh yeeeesss..." groaned Tuli. 

"What the fuck honey?" rasped Roy into her ear. 

"Awww, hubby doesn't like to share, Huh?" said patrolwoman Naines' voice. "Although, that's seems like strange position if you don't want someone else sliding in there next to you, especially if you're down here where you'd expect to find a bunch of other horny fuckers like yourself." 

"We... uh..." still, no viable excuse occurred to Roy. 

The light danced briefly as Naines handed her flashlight to her partner. As she moved forward, her silhouette in the twin beams revealed her to be of below average height with a square-ish head and stocky frame. She stepped between Tuli's thighs and began slowly unbuckling her belt as she ran her eyes down Tuli's trembling body. Her eyes came to rest between Tuli's thighs where her pussy lay wide open and her ass was slowly gyrating on Roy's semi-hard cock. 

Patrolwoman Naines continued, "I think you two get off on doing it where people can see you... and maybe even join in." Roy felt her lightly draw her fingers across his scrotum. He twitched at the sensation. "But I am certain of one thing, you two are really turning me on." Roy felt Tuli shudder with desire as Naines' hand moved onto her flesh. 

"Oooo, you like that huh?" said Naines. 

"Mmmm, yeeeeah," said Tuli. 

Roy felt his cock begin to grow firm again as Tuli pumped him more energetically in response to Naines slow, firm caresses. Roy could see woman cop's face now as she bent down to bathe Tuli's breasts with her tongue. Her wide-set eyes were so dilated it was hard to see their color. It made her look hungry and a little insane. Her face slowly descended Tuli's body, down her abdomen and into her pussy. Tuli writhed as Naines began vigorously tonguing her clit. Roy began pumping Tuli more forcefully as Naines cradled his balls and began stroking his taint. 

"Ohhh Christ," he heard himself gasp. 

Now he felt Naines touching his shaft, stroking with two fingers; a delicate, spongy touch that sent jolts of pleasure racing back into his balls as her fingers slipped up and down in Tuli's vagina. As Naines pivoted her pudgy fingers forward to stroke Tuli's g-spot, her knuckles rolled along the underside of Roy's dick through the layers of soft inner flesh. The hot, tight depths of Tuli's rectum and the relentless play of Naines' fingers up and down the underside of his cock from within Tuli's pussy were too much. He let his head drop back as he felt his orgasm rapidly approach. 

As his body tingled and shook in the approach to release, Roy was looking at nothing; just focusing on the pleasure blooming within him and the sensation of Tuli's sweat-soaked back sliding against his chest as she rode his cock and Naines' face and fingers. However, for whatever reason, he fixed his sight on the knot hole directly above them, looking for the purplish light from the arcade overhead. But there was no light. Instead an eye with an ice blue iris gazed down, as all-seeing and emotionless as the one atop the pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill. He wasn't even sure it was there until it blinked. Or winked, maybe; he couldn't tell. He imagined someone on all fours above him, eye pressed to the ground. How many people were noticing, waiting their turn to watch? 

Holy shit, he thought. Is everyone in this damned town going to watch us screw at some point!? 

"Unnnngh!" gulped Tuli as she went suddenly stiff. 

As she came her head snapped back and hit Roy in the chin. He barely felt it. With Tuli climaxing on top of him and Naines fingers stroking him inside Tuli's ass he was in the final headlong rush to orgasm. He focused on the ice blue iris as he came. It seemed to cover the sky from horizon to horizon as his perception collapsed in a rush of pleasure. 

"Ohhh OH!" he gulped as he finally came, shooting his eager, dutiful sperm deep into Tuli's guts. Poor guys, they were in for a nasty surprise. 

"Christ rookie," said the male cop's voice. He sounded more than a little shocked. 

But Naines didn't respond, not right away anyway. After a twenty second lag she heaved a truncated gasp and sagged onto Tuli. As she did Roy felt his depleted cock slide from Tuli's ass. 

"Sorry Hal, just had to finish up there," she panted as she began to pull her self up off the sand while re-buckling her slacks. 

"That was something else," said Hal. "Fuck, no blue pill and I've got a hard-on like a fifteen year old kid." 

"You wanna poke? All holes open..." Naines said, motioning to Tuli.  

===

Roy couldn't think. His head had been flushed clear by the rush of orgasm and it remained clear in the slowly fading high he'd been maintaining all evening... 

"Hmmm, you know, Terri won't do oral. It's been a long time since I got my dick sucked. Why don't you take the Mister outside? I can't function when I'm watched." 

"Come on honey, on your knees," said Naines as she helped Tuli off of Roy. 

Tuli turned to look quickly at Roy. Her eyes were wild. She dropped to her knees in the sand without hesitation or objection and began to fumble with the male cop's fly. 

"Come on buddy. Let's leave these two alone," said Naines. 

Roy cast several glances at Tuli as he was lead away, she didn't return the look. Stunned, he pulled his clothes closed as Naines lead him back through a dog-legged corridor to a plywood door. She fished out a key and opened a heavy, serious looking padlock. 

"You guys are good," she said conversationally. "Where'd they find you?" 

"Wha?" he said. He couldn't believe his wife was around that corner, sucking off some fat, sleazy cop. He could probably drop Naines if he cold-cocked her, maybe take Hal if he took him unawares, but could they get away? Would Tuli even want to? She really hadn't put up much of a fight. She'd seemed downright eager in fact. 

"Where'd the guys find you? Atlantic City? Philly? They have to go all the way up to New York?" She opened the door and led Roy out into a parking lot behind a brick building. 

"What are you talking about?" 

"For this prank... Mavis warned me that as a rookie and a woman and an out lesbian they'd set up something to try to freak me out." She smiled. "I thought I showed him, huh? Naines don't freak out, Ha!" 

Roy just looked at her blankly. There was a smattering of freckles between patrolwoman Naines' smallish eyes. Her dirty-blond hair was pulled back into a messy French braid. Her self satisfied face began to loose a little of its composure as Roy eyes remained uncomprehending. 

"Hal won't hurt my wife will he?" he asked. 

Naines eyes flashed panic. "Holy fuck, you guys aren't a set up..." 

"No. We were just... being spontaneous." 

"Oh shit... Ohshitohshitohshit. Holy fucking goddamned shit. Ohhhh nooo." 

"Are you OK?" 

"Am I OK?" I just fucked some poor married couple in front of my new partner. Now I'm gonna be the lezzie whore of the whole goddamned department now. Ohhhh shit!" 

"I'm sure it'll be OK," said Roy, patting her shoulder. 

"NO IT FUCKING WON'T! You don't know what cops are like. I should never have moved out here from Trenton. I'm ruined. Ruined..." 

Roy could see tears in her eyes. She turned away as the plywood door swung open and Tuli stepped out. She was fussing with her torn, wrinkled dress. Her eyes looked dazed. Roy rushed up to her and took her in his arms. 

"Are you OK?" they said to each other at once. 

"Look kids," said the male cop -- his tag, visible now in the lighted parking lot, said his name was Warston. He was pot-bellied, graying with a ridiculous handlebar mustache. "Stay the fuck out of there. Next time, we will take you in." 

"Yes sir," said Roy and Tuli. 

"However, thank you very much ma'am, nonetheless. And enjoy your stay in Blaire Island." 

*** 

Roy and Tuli wandered away to find a cab. Tuli clutched the torn cleavage of her dress as they walked along in silence. When they passed a pretzel cart she bought an orange soda and gargled with it before spitting it out into some bushes. She repeated the process several times. 

"That guy must eat nothing but fried foods," she complained. "His cum tastes like crap." 

Roy didn't know what to say to that. He said nothing. 

In the back seat of a cab on the ride back to the cabin Roy held Tuli close. Lost in his own thoughts and slow of brain from his fading high, he was late to notice that Tuli was quietly sobbing into his chest. Roy pulled her to him. "Are you OK," he asked, stupidly. He didn't know what else to do. 

"I'm scared." 

"Don't be. We'll be fine." 

"Even if I turn back into a slut? I'm worried I'm relapsing, Roy. I thought I was done with all that... shit." 

"I'll love you no matter what, babe." He said gently. "But maybe we should play the rest of this vacation more one-on-one." 

She nodded into his chest. "Will you make love to me when we get back?" she asked. 

"Of course." 

Back in the cabin he excused himself and headed for the shower to wash the smears of santorum from his cock. Tuli said she'd meet him in bed and gave him a gentle peck on the cheek. In the shower he lingered, determined to get the water right for a change. Getting it close enough, he stepped in and let the spray soak into his head. He willed it to penetrate his skull and flush his mind clear. But, as he suspected, it didn't work that way; not at all. 

He came back from the bathroom to find Tuli curled up in a tight ball in bed. She was deep asleep. Roy climbed in behind her and kissed the back of her head. "We'll be fine," he said softly to her mass of hair, black and shapeless in the dark. "We survived this and I can't imagine it getting any weirder from here." 

But as he lay back he still fretted. He'd never had a particularly robust imagination. It probably could get a lot weirder, actually. 

And he was right to worry. It got a lot weirder.

Greetings beloved readers, this is the fourth of a five part series. I will post each chapter about a week apart. Many thanks to fellow authors and occasional collaborators Friskee_cpl who gave me notes on the story and whose stories served as a vital inspiration for this tale. 

* 

It was nearly seven-thirty when Tuli woke Roy for a kiss. She was wearing her Scarlet Knights sports-bra and tight black shorts. Her hair was pulled up into a high pony-tail and a red sweatband hugged her forehead. She looked both cute and sexy. It was almost enough to tempt Roy out of the sheets. Almost. 

"Enjoy your jog," he mumbled as he rolled back into his pillow. 

"Don't want to come with me?" she asked. 

"No. Wanna sleep." 

At home they usually ran together but Roy had decided that all the swimming, dancing and screwing they'd been doing this week made jogging temporarily superfluous. Tuli was much more dedicated. The old photo of her pimply, pudgy, high school self that she kept on the fridge was all the motivation she had ever needed to maintain a near-fanatic devotion to her exercise program and perpetual diet. Roy hated that she tortured herself so, but he had to admit... he really liked the results. 

"I love you," she said as she paused at the door. 

"Love you too," he said. "Have fun." 

Roy laid back and waited for sleep. His mind was blank, almost Zen-like in its gummy, post pot-binge state of mental ruin. It had been years and years since he'd smoked weed, longer still since he'd smoked so much. He remembered now why he stopped. He felt like he'd lost ten IQ points and his lungs felt shriveled, black and heavy with resin. 

As his mind rambled aimlessly through the debris of fragmented memories, the queasy realities of yesterday began to pop to the surface. Details came flooding back in a rush: Jimmy, Wanda, that African kid Mike, the police woman Naines and her middle aged partner Warton. Soon his foggy mind was churning with a quick-cut whirlpool of fresh, sordid recollections that both aroused and repulsed him. He opened his eyes and stared at the seascape that hung on the wall. But still his mind's eye tormented him. 

Roy realized he wasn't going to get back to sleep. He got up, pulled on a pair of shorts and headed for the back door hoping that the sea air would clear his mind. That's where he found Jimmy: at the edge of the cabin's little patio, leaning on the scrubby oak by the bar-b-queue, talking to one of the red-headed girls from Cabin E next door. 

"Yeah, but is it naturally red?" Jimmy was saying as he flicked at a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped the girl's braids. She wore a gray tee- shirt that read 'Frelinghuysen Freshmen Girl's Volleyball' and a pair of cutoff denim shorts. She was a couple of inches taller than Jimmy, but she stood just off the raised brick patio to strategically conceal the difference. As Jimmy teased her, she giggled and chewed suggestively on the ear piece of her black framed glasses while self-consciously thrusting out her chest and arching her back. 

"Oh, hey bro," said Jimmy when Roy opened the door. "This is, umm... it's Molly, right?" 

"Yeah," she said. "It's Molly." 

"This is my man, Roy," said Jimmy. "I was telling Molly how we were partying yesterday and she..." 

"Hold on Jimmy. How old are you Molly?" 

"She told me she's nineteen." 

"I am nineteen." 

"Whoa, no way," said Roy. "Sorry kid, you aren't invited," he said as he turned and walked back inside. 

"I gotta talk to Roy about that thing we discussed, but I'll see you around, right?" said Jimmy quickly as he followed Roy into the cabin. 

"Christ Jimmy, what are you thinking? Nineteen!?" 

"What are you thinking? Nineteen is legal, man. Do you think she has red pussy hair? Oh man, I love a..." 

"What about Wanda?" 

"What about her?" He snorted a laughed. "Hey, forget the bitches for a sec. I gotta run up to Staten Island today, you wanna come with?" 

"Staten Island?" 

"Yeah, those kids Wanda and I partied with last night smoked up all my weed, so I gotta run up to see my dealer." 

"Christ, that'll take most of the day from here." 

"Not the way I drive!" he laughed. "But yeah, it's a real pain in the ass." 

"You couldn't find anyone to buy from around here? Or go without?" 

"Yeah, right, vacation without weed," he snorted his contempt for the idea. "Problem is, I don't want to ask around too much because if I get busted one more time I'm gonna be in deep shit. Louie - he's my man in S.I. -- him I can trust. So, you coming or not?" 

"No! I'm supposed to be having a romantic vacation with my wife, remember?" 

"Yeah, I figured you say something like that. That's why I figured you, me and the girls should have a little orgy before I go. I want to have a nice fuck- buzz goin' when I leave. I was tryin' to get that redhead in on it too, but you kinda fucked that up, bro." 

"An orgy? Now? Um, well... Tuli's out jogging right now.' 

"Well, shit! I guess it's just you, me and Wanda Jean then," said Jimmy as he pulled out a phone and tapped a button. "Hey babe, got your face on? ...No, she's jogging. ...No. ...Yeah, I know. ...No, just come on over here. ...Yeah, of course. ...How the fuck should I know? He just said she went jogging. Now just get your boney ass the fuck over here, will ya?" 

"If she doesn't want to..." started Roy, but Jimmy held up a hand to silence him. 

"...Right. See you in a second babe," finished Jimmy. He slipped the phone back into his cargo shorts. "She'll be right over." 

A minute later Wanda walked in the front door without knocking. "Hi, Roy," she said while scanning the room. "Tuli back yet?" 

"Still jogging." 

"Bummer." 

"Well bro, while the bitch is away the player will play!" said Jimmy with a laugh. 

Roy opened his mouth to ask Jimmy to please not refer to his wife as 'The Bitch' but Jimmy had already moved on to more urgent considerations. "So, you ready to DP Wanda, bro?" 

Still foggy-brained, Roy felt unmoored, like events were pushing him along before he had a chance to think or react. All he knew was something about Jimmy's plan bothered him. 

"Umm...I don't know ... maybe..." he said. 

"Why don't we just wait for Tuli?" asked Wanda. 

"Cause you'll have all fuckin' day to lez out on Tooley and I wanna shoot my load and get on the road. Besides, I bet you'd like two cocks at once, wouldn't you? Come on, admit it." 

"Yeah, I guess," she said. 

"Hey, maybe we should..." started Roy. 

"Don't you start with me," said Jimmy. "Wanda, take his dick out and suck it. And if he complains again, bite it off," he laughed. 

Wanda laughed too. "Yeah, OK," she said with a grin that made Roy uneasy. She knelt in front of him and started opening his shorts. Jimmy got behind her. 

Wanda wasted no time in sliding Roy's manhood into her mouth. Her tiny fingers circled the base and cradled his balls as his cock slipped over her lips, past her teeth and up along her tongue. With her face locked on Roy's cock, Jimmy pulled Wanda up by her hips and yanked her mini-skirt down her legs. Crouching behind, he buried his face in her pussy. She shuddered at the sensation, her mouth quivering around Roy's shaft as she clutched his pelvis for support. Roy slipped his hands under her to hold her firm little tits and she hummed her pleasure around his burgeoning erection. 

But still Roy fought a growing sense of vague anxiety. He struggled to will his mind back into the calm, befuddled blankness of earlier and focus only on the pleasure of his cock slipping back and forth along Wanda's tongue. He let his eyes wander into the sleeve of tattooed vines extending up her left arm and coiling out across her shoulder. He grew hypnotized by the play of her wiry muscles beneath the tapestry of her flesh as he felt the pleasure build within him. He pushed her tube-top down her body and took her nipples in his hands. She hummed encouragement as she redoubled her attention to the sensitive cords of skin just beneath the helmet of his prick. If he could just relax he'd come any second. 

It was then that Jimmy ruined everything. Standing up behind her to line up his cock to Wanda's pussy, he reached forward he put the palm of his hand on the back of her head. "Come on, babe. Show Roy what you can do," he said as he pushed forward. 

She resisted as Jimmy pressed her face deeper onto Roy's shaft. Roy felt his cock force its way down her throat. His body erupted in goose-bumps at the tight, muscular feel of her esophagus but she began to thrash uncomfortably the further he filled her. Roy shrank back and pulled himself from her mouth. She gasped loudly as his dick popped free. 

"Jesus fucking Christ Jimmy, stop that," she said with a cough. 

"I promised Roy a deep-throat. Don't make me a liar." 

"Then you suck him off then. Roy's a lot wider than you and that fucking hurts." 

Jimmy didn't say anything but Roy could tell immediately that Wanda had said exactly the wrong thing. Jimmy's face had fallen from a mischievous grin to dead eyed fury in a blink. 

"Oh. I'm too small for you, huh?" 

"Jimmy, that's not what I..." 

"Maybe I should fuck you somewhere where you can feel it then," he said. Grabbing her hips roughly, he spat once onto her asshole and pressed forward with his cock. His eyes had a wild, vengeful look. 

"What are you doing? Ow! Use more fuckin' lube you dick!" 

"It shouldn't be a problem right? Not with my tiny dick, huh? So just fucking take it, bitch." 

"Hey... Come on Jimmy..." began Roy, but a cold stare from Jimmy shut him up. 

Wanda held onto Roy's cock like a lifeline as Jimmy pumped her mercilessly. She whimpered and swore as her tiny body twisted and shook from his vicious invasion. Roy stayed silent, just wishing this whole ugly scene was finished. He should try to stop this, he knew, but how? Jimmy was so damn muscular and Roy really didn't want to get beaten to a pulp this morning; not for Wanda, anyway. 

So Roy did nothing. Fortunately, it was soon over. Jimmy pitched forward with a grunt and shuddered as he erupted, balls deep in Wanda's backside. 

"There you go, did you feel that?" he said, slapping her ass hard as he backed away. He glared at Roy with a grim stare as he pulled on his shorts with an angry swiftness. 

"You're such a fucking baby. That hurt, you jackoff!" cried Wanda. 

Roy said nothing. He just stood there with his dick in Wanda's hand. 

Jimmy pointed at Roy as if accusing him of something. "When I get back it's Tooley's turn. We're gonna double up on your bitch - ass and pussy." He turned and walked off through the kitchen towards the back door. 

"Hey, I think that's up to..." 

"Fair's fair, Bro. You fuckin' owe me..." shouted Jimmy. "Later!" The door slammed shut behind him as he left. 

"Fuck," said Wanda. "He can be such an asshole." 

"Do you love him?" 

Wanda shrugged. "Oh he's usually OK. And he's got a real nice apartment, way better than I could afford as a goddamned barista. There's a doorman and everything." 

"Oh." 

Wanda pulled off her tube top and threw it aside. "Hey, you want to finish what we started? Come on, let's screw. You really do have a pretty good cock, Roy- boy." Her grin was suddenly cute and mischievous. 

"Uh, thanks..." said Roy as she pulled herself close to his chest. 

She was so tiny, easily more than a foot shorter than Roy. He felt his cock throb against her upper abdomen as she held him tightly. She took the initiative, pushing Roy back onto the couch and climbing up onto his lap. She pulled his face to hers and kissed him deeply. Roy kissed back. He circled his arms around her, feeling her body and pulling her to him. She rose up and guided his erection to the gates of her sex. With a satisfied sigh, she sat back and let him fill her. Their eyes met. Holding their gaze she began moving up and down, fucking him slowly as her breath came in short gasps. 

"Mmm, how's that?" she purred into his ear. She reached up and took fistfuls of his hair in her tiny hands. She pulled his head back and chewed on his neck as she rode him with increased urgency. "It's so nice to fuck a guy with some hair," she breathed. 

"Oh... Good," he said. Holy shit, she felt good: tight, miniature. It was like fucking a mythic species: a pixie or maybe a sexy hobbit. 

"Roooy, Some asshole keyed our ..." came Tuli's voice as the door swung open. She froze when she saw Wanda riding her husband down to his balls. 

"Oh...Hi honey," said Roy weakly. 

"Tuli!" gasped Wanda. "Come here... join us... I wanna kiss you." 

Tuli walked over slowly. She paused behind Wanda and, taking her shoulders in lightly in hand, pecked her gently on top of her head. Wanda came immediately, screaming out in a short bark as she quaked on Roy's cock. 

"Oh... I wish you'd got back earlier," sighed Wanda as she finally shook off the last of her climax. 

"Would you give me a couple of minutes alone with Roy, sweetie?" said Tuli. 

"Sure," said Wanda as she climbed off Roy's cock. She pulled on her top and skirt as she headed for the back door. "I need a smoke now anyway." 

Tuli just stood looking at Roy as she waited for Wanda to leave. Roy's cock was glistening with Wanda's dampness as she stared at it with disappointment. "So you changed your mind, huh?" she finally said. 

"Wha...?" began Roy. But then he remembered. On the way to the cabin last night with Tuli, who was exhausted and freaked out after their episode under the boardwalk, he'd suggested they keep the rest of the vacation "one-on-one". He'd put a halt to their little experiment and then completely forgotten about it. 

"Look Roy, we can screw around with other people or we can keep it strictly between us, but you have to make up your mind which it's going to be." 

"Oh shit, I forgot... I'm sorry." 

"Roy, we can't work this based on how hard your dick is at any given time." 

"Jimmy started it, I..." 

"Jimmy? Please, Roy. If were going to do this," she indicated his damp cock. "It has to be something we do as a couple. Do you really want to give me permission to fuck any cute jogger who comes up and asks me if I want to use the Jacuzzi at his condo? I could have today you know... twice!" 

Roy swallowed hard. She had a point. He tried to explain. "Listen, this shit doesn't come naturally to me and I don't know how it's supposed to work. I'd slept with a total of nine women before you. Nine. I'm trying babe, you have to believe me. But it's hard." 

Tuli smiled at him sadly. "Remember last night? I said I was scared I was relapsing back to my horrible slutty self? I'm still scared Roy. I don't trust myself if we start straying out of our relationship. I know how I am, Roy; that Wild Girl is still in there trying to get out. I don't need the temptation." He saw a tear fall down her cheek. "I love you Roy. I want to have crazy sex with you. Any other person we bring into our bed is to make our sex better, together." 

"Jesus. I'm sorry honey... I fucked up," he said. 

"It's OK. I'm sorry I bitched out. Maybe what you need is for me to..." 

She paused mid sentence when she was interrupted by a thump that came from the living room window. Her eyes popped open in surprise and disbelief at something glanced from the corner of her eye. 

"What was that?" asked Roy. 

"I... I think Wanda just caught the kid next store peeking in our window." 

"E-boy again?" he said, using their private nickname for the kid from cabin E; Tuli's not so secret admirer. 

"I think so. But she pulled him away from the window. I only saw some red hair and his glasses." 

It occurred to Roy that he'd seen E-boy reading one paperback after another down on the beach, but never wearing glasses. He got a sudden sinking feeling. "Black glasses? Clunky hipster frames?" 

"They were black." 

"Oh shit." 

That's when the front door burst open and Wanda re-entered driving Molly ahead of her. Molly was bent at the waist as she twisted in discomfort at the end of Wanda's tattooed left arm. With Molly nearly six feet tall and Wanda barely five, they looked badly mismatched as Wanda pulled her to the center of the living room. Wanda stood triumphant as she firmly held Molly's ear and squeezed. 

"Ow!" said Molly. 

"Look who I caught peeking in the window." she said as she released her ear. 

Roy sighed as he pulled a pillow onto his lap to hide his dick. This was getting way too complicated. 

"Did your brother send you to spy on us?" demanded Tuli in full-on teacher mode; as if interrogating an eighth grader over a breach in discipline. 

"My brother?" 

"We've seen him ogling my wife," offered Roy although he already knew it wasn't Molly's dorky brother that had prompted her to peek into their cabin. He wondered exactly what Jimmy had told her. 

"I don't pimp for my brother." 

"Well, what are you doing here then?" said Wanda, accusingly. 

"Oh... I don't know," sighed Molly as she sat, uninvited, on the couch. "I feel like I'm going frickin' crazy down here. My boyfriend's hitchhiking across Europe this summer while I'm working a shit job so I can afford my stupid textbooks next year. I get one stinking week off and I have to spend it on the Jersey shore at lame-assed Blaire-fucking-Island... with my family. And I'm sure my boyfriend's cheating on me over there. I'd feel better about it if I was fucking around too, but I haven't been with anyone in almost four weeks. I'm just so bored and horny I could die." 

"And Jimmy told you we're swingers?" asked Wanda, sounding more pissed at Jimmy than Molly now. "And invited you to come over and fuck around with us?" 

"Well, not in so many words, but... yeah, pretty much." 

Tuli sat down between her and Roy and reached up to remove the girl's glasses. Molly didn't resist. She had large chestnut brown eyes in a plain, wholesome face speckled with a constellation of freckles. She squinted at them in blurry trepidation. 

"So, you want to play with us, huh?" 

The girl swallowed nervously. "Yeah..." 

"Did James tell you about the initiation?" asked Tuli. 

Wanda smiled, suddenly very interested in where this was going. Tuli turned to her and Roy and winked. Roy grinned as he began to see Tuli's plan to get rid of the kid. At least, that's what he thought he was seeing. 

"Initiation?" said Molly, looking nervous. "What... What would I have to do?" she asked quietly as her eyes darted around the room. 

"Everything, sweetie," said Wanda. "Everything." 

"I'm not a lezzie, OK? I don't eat pussy." 

"Well, I'm not a lezzie and I do," said Tuli. 

Molly looked to Wanda and Roy. "I'll do anything else... I'm just not queer." 

"Well, maybe you should leave then? And when you go, stay the hell away from our window," said Tuli as she offered the girl her glasses. 

But Molly didn't take them. "I'll do anything else..." she said. 

"Take off your clothes then," blurted out Wanda. 

Tuli shot Wanda a grin as Molly stood and began nervously pulling off her tee- shirt and denim shorts. Roy looked hard at Tuli - a whatthefuck look - but she ignored him. Her eyes had a gleam that could only be described as predatory. Was it an act? He had no idea. 

Molly stopped undressing when she reached the bikini she was wearing beneath her clothes. She seemed to tremble and her eyes danced with reluctant desire as they inspected her body. As Tuli reached out towards her bottoms Molly grasped her lower lip tightly in her teeth and closed her eyes. As Tuli's hands slipped under the fabric she nearly jumped out of her skin. But she did not recoil, merely gasping as Tuli slid her fingers into her labia. 

"Oh my, you're so wet. I think you like being ordered around, Hmm? I bet what you really want is for us to make you do the all the freaky things you're too afraid to try," she cast a sidelong look at Roy before turning back to the girl. "I'm right aren't I?"  

===

Roy felt a sudden surge of panic. What the hell was his wife doing? He leaned in and whispered in Tuli's ear, "She's only nineteen!" 

"How do you know that?" asked Tuli sharply. 

"I...," sputtered Roy. 

"He showed up when I was talking to Jimmy this morning," answered Molly for him. "When Jimmy told him I was nineteen he told me to get lost. He was kind of a jerk, actually. I mean, Jimmy didn't have a problem with my age." 

"Fuckin' Jimmy!" growled Wanda. 

Tuli turned to Roy and gave him a pleased but sad smile. "So you saved her from Jimmy, huh? You're such a nice guy, Bubbs, but you don't know a damn thing about women." She kissed him sweetly. 

Roy looked at Wanda who was nodding in agreement. Molly looked embarrassed and nervous, but mostly impatient. 

Tuli spoke to Roy as if explaining a simple mathematical concept to a slow and stubborn seventh grader. "You're still stuck on that tired old idea of women as delicate flowers who need protection from the big bad world of sex. We are sex, Bubbs. Why do you think so much of society is geared toward tricking us into keeping our legs closed? We'd spend all day fucking if we could. We have a greater capacity for it and, I think, a greater aptitude. The problem is that it's just so hard for a girl to trust her instincts. Sometimes she only needs a little push down the naughty path. I've given Molly here every chance to bug out but look at her, she's ready to come if you so much as breathe heavy on her. Trust me Roy, Molly here wants nothing more than for me give her that little push." 

Tuli reached out and pulled down Molly's bottoms, exposing her auburn pubic hair. Looking equally terrified and excited, Molly reached behind herself to take her top off. 

Tuli looked at her as she continued speaking to Roy. "Most girls at nineteen are hot little collections of holes connected to brains still too terrified of being called a 'whore' or a 'slut' or a 'lez', to dare do anything fun with them. Of course our Molly here is curious, but she's been so conditioned by years of being told what good girls don't do, that it's only just occurring to her that there isn't a whole lot left - sexually - that's considered 'in- bounds' for a good girl like her. Meanwhile her boyfriend is running around, half a world away, screwing Euro-tarts one after another. But do people call him a 'slut' or 'whore'? No. He's just being a man! Such bullshit." 

Roy saw behind Tuli's mask of respectability again. Tuli the Slut had spoken and her face shone with righteous and potent power of the feminine libido. She had never looked so beautiful, desirable or frightening to him. She reached down and pulled the pillow off his lap, exposing his soft, tacky penis. 

"Now, get my husband hard again," she said. "With your mouth." 

Molly looked down into his lap with distaste. "But... he...," she pointed to Wanda. 

Wanda laughed. "That's right, eat my cunt-slop off his dick, bitch." 

"Wanda. Please," chided Tuli. "Molly, you can leave if you want." She held out her glasses again and nodded to the door. But Roy could see that Tuli knew Molly wasn't going anywhere. Indeed, Molly sank to her knees and took Roy's cock in her hand. 

The girl brought her mouth to his meat. She was hesitant at first, gagging a little at the taste of woman on his flesh. But she persisted, moving her face up and down as Roy grew larger, thicker and more rigid on each thrust. When Tuli stood to remove her clothes with Wanda quickly following suit he popped to full erection. 

"OK Molly, I want to see you ride my husband's cock," said Tuli as Tuli settled in next to Roy on the couch. Molly's eyebrows shot up her forehead when she saw Tuli settile in naked next to Roy. 

"Yes," breathed Molly. She climbed eagerly onto Roy's lap as Tuli reached over to help guide him into her body. Roy craned his neck to watch his wife's hand position his saliva slickened dick in Molly's lust-distended, russet-maned labia. Molly heaved a deep, shuddering sigh of satisfaction as she sank onto his shaft and felt it stretch the tender flesh of her young pussy. Looking over at Tuli, Roy saw Wanda pulling his wife's legs apart to push her face into her pussy. Tuli gave him a deep kiss as she trilled with pleasure. 

Although the position was the same, Roy found it was a much different experience being fucked by Molly as opposed to being fucked my Wanda. Molly was so much taller. Her pale, conical breasts bounced delightfully in his face as she moved on him. Her breath washed across his scalp. He took one nipple in his mouth then the other. Tuli stretched her neck to join him in kissing, licking and biting her hard, pink areolas. Her hand reached down to brush lightly across the girl's clit as Roy thrust into her from below. 

"Oh!" said the girl. 

"Do you mind me touching you?" asked Tuli. 

"Nooo... Don't stop." 

"Aren't you worried about being a 'lez'?" 

"No. No..." Her breaths were coming fast now as she sped up the rhythm. She leant forward mashing Roy's face between her tits. 

"What if I told you, you had to eat me before I'd let you come?" 

Her eyes were hungry and wild. "Anything... I'll do anything." 

"Get down here," said Tuli, reaching up to pull on of the girl's braids. 

She dismounted with a wet pop and dropped to the floor to crowd in between Tuli's thighs with Wanda. 

"Here, noob. Lemme show you how to eat a pussy," said Wanda as she reached around Molly's head to push her face into Tuli's sex. She resisted only a little. Soon they were both lapping up and down in the folds of Tuli's labia. Tuli tossed her head back and closed her eyes with a groan. With a hand on each girl's head and her legs spread wide she rode their faces with enraptured intensity. 

Roy watched for awhile from the couch before rising to move around and watch from behind Wanda and Molly. It was like every juvenile male fantasy come to life between his wife's thighs. As he slowly stroked his erection he grew increasingly transfixed with the frenzied rhythm of the girl's faces as they jockeyed for position in Tuli's vulva. He grew hypnotized by the undulations of Tuli's sweat-streaked body grew closer and closer to the ultimate pleasure. But still he resisted joining in; not because of any lingering tenseness from his and Tuli's brief blow-up, but because he knew he wouldn't last. The prospect of a long day attempting to keep up with three horny women had him spinning with sexual vertigo. But when Tuli's eyes opened briefly enough to fix him with a what-are-you-waiting-for look, he knew it was time to get involved. 

He knelt behind the girls and ran his hands down the crack of their asses into their pussy. They were both so wet. His fingers slipped frictionlessly through the velvety folds of their womanhood. They wiggled their tails together almost comically as he fed two fingers into each their squirming, gyrating pussies. Their groans came one high, one husky and he briefly allowed himself a fantasy of a row of lusty women in various sizes, one moaning in each chord. He imagined himself running up and down the line playing 'Smoke on the Water' with his cock, fingers and face. Hell, the way this vacation was going, who knew? Maybe by Saturday they'd have a fucking orchestra in there. 

But he could restrain himself no more. Leaving his fingers in Wanda he mounted Molly from behind and fucked them both as they pushed Tuli towards climax with their lips and tongues. Almost immediately Tuli began to come. The sight of her writhing on the couch in ecstasy, pulling at her own nipples with her legs thrown while as the two girls twisted like pale serpentines between her thighs was enough to push Roy over the edge too. A lively crescendo of grunting cries announced their mutual climax at opposite ends of Molly's body. Roy collapsed away from the group in glistening, panting pile of fuck-wracked flesh. 

Roy slunk back to watch from the easy chair. The women reconfigured themselves to focus their pleasure on Molly but as Roy watched them arrange themselves something outside caught his attention. He saw Molly's parents coming down the front steps of cabin E. Molly's dad wore a Hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts; mom was ready for the beach, dressed in scoop backed, plunging-front dark blue one- piece. Dad kissed Mom bye and walked to their van as Molly's sister and brother emerged from the cabin bearing the family's beach gear. They began calling out "Molly!" or occasionally, "Mary Margret Markey!" 

"You want to try to rejoin the action here Bubbulla?" came Tuli's voice from the knot of feminine flesh now rolling around on the floor. 

"I can try," he said. 

"I wish we had a couple of dildos," said Wanda. 

"There's a place up the highway," said Molly. "A porno store." 

"I don't know if we're budgeted for..." said Tuli. 

"They take credit cards; I found a receipt in my dad's wallet." 

"Ooooo, we should totally take a road trip," said Wanda." 

Tuli looked at Roy. He shrugged, a why not? 

"OK," said Tuli. "But let's finish what we started here..." 

*** 

Roy ended up sitting out the finale, content to watch the action on the floor while, outside, Molly's family gave up their search and headed to the beach. When the girls finally collapsed in a sweaty heap on the berber carpet he got up to to take a shower. After several long minutes fussing with the temperamental shower, he stepped out from his skin-scalding rinse and found that Wanda had rolled a joint from several of the resin-soaked roaches left over from Jimmy's oversized spliffs. The girls were sitting on the floor, passing it around. Roy declined it when it was offered. He'd decided he was done with that shit. 

The girls took quick turns washing the tackiness from their skins in water that vacillated between too hot or too cold to stand for very long. Afterwards they smoked some more of the strong roach-weed and discussed sex toys with increasing animation. Soon they were spacey and euphoric, giggling like kids. Stupid, laughing and slow, they followed Roy to his car. Fortunately, Molly's family was nowhere to be seen. 

At the car, Roy paused to inspect and lament the two parallel scratches that ran the length of his Chevy Malibu. Wanda thought it was hilarious and soon Molly and Tuli were laughing along. Roy swallowed his irritation. Somehow, he got them in the car and started off towards the causeway that linked the mainland with the sandy spit of Blaire Island. The whole way the girls giggled and talked over each other like a slumber party at one A.M. 

Roy followed Molly's vague and often too tardy directions while Tuli rambled out a monologue on how math isn't as hard as people think. "Its just remembering how numbers behave, and they're really aren't that many rules. And when you get it, it's like talking to God... God speaks in Math..." 

Roy rolled his eyes. He'd heard all this before. She talked about math when she was stoned and she called him a nerd! 

They finally spotted their destination a few miles from the Parkway. The structure looked like it had been a service station once, but now sold dirty books, raunchy films and perverted toys. The name of the place, written in large, pink letters across the front, was "BOOKSFILMS&amp;TOYS". 

"Should we park around the back?" asked Molly as Roy pulled into the lot from the highway. 

"Good idea," said Roy. "I don't want my wife to see me going into a place like this." 

Tuli laughed at that. 

As Roy coasted into a parking spot in front of the store, Wanda bounded out of the car before it had even stopped. Roy turned to Tuli. "Are you going to be able to control yourself," he said. 

"Probably not," she said. "So you'd better stick close." She turned, got out and walked towards the front doors without looking back. He followed, feeling like he was trotting into a mine field. 

They entered and maneuvered around the big elevated check-out that commanded the front doors like a fortress. The store consisted of shoulder high racks of DVDs, magazine and book racks were arranged radiating away from the checkout to give the clerk a full view of any browsing customer. The sex toys were in the back, in the opposite corner from the cashier where the arrangement of the other merchandise had left some open floor space. 

"Ooo!" squealed Wanda as she reached for a huge, doubled headed contraption. Tuli was drawn to the strap-ons. Molly glanced nervously around the store at their fellow patrons who were very deliberately trying to look like they were not ogling the girls from the corners of their eyes while doing just that. 

"There's a lot of guys here for a Thursday morning," she whispered to Roy. 

Roy hadn't noticed. There were eight or nine dudes loitering around, looking over magazines and checking out DVDs. It didn't seem out of the ordinary for middle of the day. However, the vibe was bad: resentful. Tuli was wearing her yellow sundress that clung to her body like paint and showed so much cleavage she seemed in constant danger of popping free. Wanda was wearing the same tube top and tiny skirt from earlier and Molly had left her tee-shirt at the cabin and was only wearing her bikini top with her daisy-duke shorts. When Roy looked up five or six of their fellow customers quickly looked away. These poor guys were just looking for something to jack off to and Roy had to come walking in with his three horny, giggling sluts. Even Roy could see that it wasn't fair. 

Fuck 'em, thought Roy. Let them hate me for what I got. He was seized by the same wicked thrill that had possessed him two days ago when he fucked Tuli up against the window thinking that the kid next store was watching, love struck and helpless. Now he wanted all these pathetic, pent-up jack-offs to know he was fucking these three girls. He turned back to His Women, suddenly pleased to see that they seemed intent on making a scene. His heart fluttered with a crazy thrill. 

"What d'ya think: two, three?" Wanda was holding up an armload of double headers of various design, interrupting Tuli who was inspecting the straps on a big, black strap-on. 

"Can I help you ladies wit' anything," said the cashier. He had left his fortress and now stood at Roy's elbow. He was thin, pale and looked generally greasy and unkempt. He wrung his hands nervously as he smiled at Tuli with yellow teeth. 

"You wish," sneered Wanda. 

He laughed, deciding to try to be in on the joke. With a leer, he said, "Y'know, if you wanna test-drive any of this stuff, I won't mind. Hahaha." 

Roy looked around. Every customer in the store was looking towards them, but quickly turned away when Roy's eyes swept over them. 

"But, what'll you do if we 'test-drive' something and we don't like it?" asked Tuli pointedly. 

"Huh? What?" 

"You can't sell it used. Right? What will you do with it if we use it and don't want it, hmm?" 

"Well," he said, laughing. "I guess I'd be willing to eat the cost for something like that. Hahaha." 

"Then how about this: we'll try out the stuff we want and we get to keep it all for free, since you'll 'eat the cost' anyway." 

"What? Right here?" 

"And right now." 

Roy had been laughing as Tuli argued the clerk into a corner, but he was now beginning to worry she was serious. She wasn't really proposing she and the girls fuck themselves with dildos while this little skeez watches, right? Roy feared he knew the answer. 

"Well, shit, I dunno. I don't actually own this store, I only..." 

"I'll pitch in to pay for their stuff," said a customer from a couple of aisles away. 

"Yeah, me too," said another. 

"I'm in." 

"Yup." 

Roy looked around, the crowd drifted closer while each voicing their commitment to pay for whatever Tuli and the girls decided they wanted to play with. Fistfuls of money were gathered. 

Roy gingerly stepped up behind Tuli. "What the hell are you doing?" he whispered into her ear. 

"Showing off," she said. "Like the other night in the window? Remember?" 

"Yeah, but, this is... really, really different." 

"Yeaaaah," she said with a wanton purr. "It sure is." 

"There's a lot of guys here. You could get raped. You could all get raped. I might get raped." 

"Oh Roy, I'm a middle school teacher. Crowd control is ninety percent of my job," she whispered. "A bunch of horny, lonely dudes isn't that different from a class of thirteen year olds. Besides, you're here. You'll keep an eye on these horny bastards for us." 

"Whoa, what? I don't think..." 

She frowned at him like he was letting her down. 

"I love you," he said. 

"Ditto, Bubbs. But you owe me after your little solo fling with Wanda this morning," she said as she kissed him. "I just want to show off with the girls. I just want an audience. That's all. Just keep them back. You're a tall, in- shape guy. It'll be easy for you." 

"I... um... OK," he said, checkmated and fighting an urge to vomit. 

Tuli winked and smiled. She turned back to the crowd. 

The girls gathered closer to Tuli. Molly seemed to be trying to hide behind herself, entwining her legs and crossing her arms across her chest. In the process she only managed to mash up a generous amount of cleavage which redoubled the men's ogling. Roy was surprised to see that Wanda actually looked nervous too, not as nervous as Molly of course, but still pretty edgy for someone who Roy had thought was essentially fearless. 

Tuli held up her hands and spoke. "Wait a minute here, guys. This has gone too far. There's no way this could work." She looked around at the assembling knot of men. They looked desperate, horny and, now, angry about getting jerked around by these teasing sluts. "I'm sure you'd never agree to all of our conditions." 

A low, murmured "???" came back to her. 

Tuli began speaking in her Teacher Voice: clear, in-command, loud and measured. Roy imagined her using the same voice to explain bathroom pass policy to a new class of kids. As she spoke she counted off her conditions on a hand held aloft. "One: no photos. I want the security cameras off and want all cell phones handed in. Two: I want the doors locked. Once we start, no one goes out or comes in. No exceptions. If that door opens, it's over guys. Three: No touching," she nodded to Roy as the crowd groaned its disappointment. "If you disobey it will piss off my man and he's an ex-Navy SEAL who will kill you without thinking." 

A low, murmured "OK" came from the crowd. Tuli looked at Roy with a hard look that said something like - don't fuck this up Roy! Roy nodded and tried to look threatening, as he imagined an ex-Navy SEAL might look while waiting for his wife to do an impromptu sex-toy show in front of a random group of South Jersey perverts. 

As word got passed around that three hot nymphos were getting busy in the sex toys section, a few more guys drifted in from the private video booths in back. The clerk ran to the front door to lock the two deadbolts and Roy followed to ensure that he also turned off the security cameras. Tuli gathered everyone's phones. One older dude claimed not to own a one, so she had Wanda search him thoroughly to verify he wasn't lying. The faces of the other patrons drooped with regret at not-having-thought-of-that. When Roy rejoined the crowd he did a quick count and tallied thirteen dudes with him in a semicircle around his wife, Wanda and Molly. Even Tuli looked a little nervous now. 

'Well, I don't really have a lesson plan..." she said, looking at the pile of perverse paraphernalia they had assembled. 

"We could..." began Molly, but she trailed off in embarrassment when everyone looked towards her. 

"What?" asked Tuli. 

"Well, we could start with some, like, hand-cuffs, and maybe this..." she held up a ball gag.  

===

"And who would we try that kind of stuff on, Molly?" asked Tuli quietly. The crowd drew a half step closer. Molly blushed as she grinned devilishly. Tuli picked up a pair of fur-lined manacles and handed them to Molly. "Put these on behind your back, dear." 

Molly snapped one cuff onto her wrist and, with her arms behind her, the other clicked shut. Her breaths were quick and shallow as the room inspected her. They doubled in intensity when Tuli stepped behind her, tugged off her bikini top and tossed it into the crowd. 

"Can I?" asked Wanda, holding up the ball-gag and gazing wickedly at Molly. 

"Do whatever you want with her while I put this one," answered Tuli as she picked up a strap-on with a long, pink, baroquely detailed faux-penis. 

Wanda was already shoving the ball-gag into Molly's mouth. Molly shot Tuli a pleading look that seemed to say: don't put me in the hands of this psycho bitch! Tuli only smiled and patted her head before gliding through the doorway leading to the video booths, looking for a place to change into her plastic dick. 

Roy watched the girls as Wanda pulled off Molly's denim shorts and bikini bottoms, leaving Molly nude as she stood facing the crowd with the wrists manacled behind her. Little Wanda was so short, she barely had to bend as she began kissing, licking and nibbling Molly's soft, pale breasts; leaving shimmering trails of saliva across and around Molly's stiff, pink areolas. Molly's head lolled. Her eyes grew dreamy and heavy-lidded with pleasure even as she looked at their crowd's hard, watching eyes with a pained expression of barely contained fear. The searing force of all those lustful stares on her bare flesh seemed to heighten Molly's senses and enflame her arousal. She moaned and panted in pleasure until, suddenly, her eyes flashed open and a gasp escaped around her gag. As Wanda moved away from Molly's chest, she left a steel nipple clamp biting into each of the girl's sensitive, trembling buds. 

"That's better," said Wanda with a smile as she admired her work. Her voice switched immediately back to bitch as she spoke to Molly again. "Turn around, Pup. I want these pathetic jerk-offs to get a good, long look at your ass and pussy." The crowd of men shuffled a little closer. Their hands were moving slowly and urgently in their pockets. 

Molly turned away from her audience obediently although she looked terrified. Wanda ordered her to spread her legs and bend over so, with her hands cuffed behind her back and her feet placed wide, Molly leaned forward. She bent further and further at Wanda's harsh, insistent orders until her head was down below the level of her ass. The girl seemed to be having trouble maintaining the position as the muscles of her long legs stretched beneath her smooth, freckled skin. Wanda took hold of the handcuffs to steady her and slapped Molly once across the ass. 

"Look at that boys," she laughed. "Fresh!" 

The men mumbled in approval. 

Mewing and moaning in her appreciation, Wanda slid her hand down along Molly's ass and let her fingers glide into and through the girl's labia. They could all see she was very wet. Nonetheless, Wanda picked up a bottle of oil and began dousing the girl's ass and vulva; rubbing the glossy, slick liquid onto the girl's flesh and pushing it into her body. Molly moaned lustily around her ball. 

"Psst!" came a hiss from Roy's left. He looked up and there was Tuli. Her fake cock was still dangling from her hand by its network of straps as she peeked around the corner. She looked annoyed. Roy wondered how long she had been trying to drag his attention from Molly's ever-slickening pussy and ass. 

"Sorry dear," he said as he ducked around the corner. "I was distracted." 

"Nineteen doesn't seem too young for you suddenly?" she said. 

"Don't give me any jealous shit.. dear," he said pointedly. 

"No. I'm just... It's this stupid dildo. I can't get it on. I'm just annoyed." 

"Here," said Roy, turning her around and squatting down behind her. "Let me take a look." 

It was a concrete ability where Roy stood head and shoulders above Tuli: dealing with anything mechanical, including, apparently, the straps of a complicated, high-dollar, strap-on dildo. He felt happilly useful as he fastened to phallus to his wife's pelvis, pausing occasionally to kiss her lightly on her bare ass. He got confused once when he let his attention wander outside the doorway, lured by a gagged squawk from Molly as Wanda began fucking her with an obscenely huge, jet black dildo. However, he soon had Tuli's phallus secured, despite the distractions. 

"All done," he said, patting her ass. His mind, distracted by the task and operating totally within the moment, hummed pleasantly in his skull. 

"How do I look?" asked Tuli. She turned to show him her profile with her long pink phallus poking out from under her sundress. 

"Silly." 

Tuli pulled her dress off and tossed it aside. She looked hot. However, even naked, with a big pink cock strapped to her pelvis, the look wasn't complete. "Hold on a sec. I think I know what you need," he said darting back out through the door. 

Roy walked out among the sex-toy displays. Molly was still bent over precariously. Wanda was now plunging three fingers into her ass as she fucked her with the dildo. The men had moved a little closer. Roy found the pair of thigh-high, black leather, four-inch heel boots he had noticed earlier. He checked the size. It was just right: size seven, Tuli's size. 

"Hey," objected the clerk. "Those're expensive." But the coiled hostility of a dozen horny men smothered his protests and he cowered away. 

Back in the foyer to the video booths, Roy helped Tuli get the boots on. They were awesome. 

"Oh. Wow." 

"Look good?" 

"Oh fuck yeah. Let me get out there. I want to see your entrance." He kissed her and left. 

Roy found a good spot for observation, over by a rack of flavored lubes. Tuli came sashaying out shortly thereafter. All hint of trepidation was gone. She walked with sublime confidence in those ridiculous and unbelievably sexy boots. She let her heavy bosom bounce and hips wiggle on each strutting stride as she sauntered up to the girls. Molly looked up at Tuli with a wide-eyed gaze full of relief and simmering anticipation. 

Wanda abandoned Molly for Tuli; leaving the huge dildo in Molly's ass and a purring vibrator in her pussy as she dropped down and began making a great show of licking Tuli's boots. She licked up from the bottoms of the heels to the tops of the leggings, up along Tuli's thighs to her strap-on where she began mouthing the rigid phallus. But Roy noticed little of their display. He was too busy watching Molly. 

Molly's legs quivered as she struggled to maintain balance. The fat rod in he ass, the buzzing vibrator in her pussy, the horny eyes surveying her body: it all pushed her further into a squirming, panting fever of arousal. But she'd been kept in that position for so long the discomfort and pain was increasingly intense. Roy found a perverse fascination in watching the tight muscles in her long legs strain and stand out against her freckled flesh. He studied her face as the pleasure and the pain battled for control of her overloaded senses. Long trails of sweat flowed her tortured musculature like water over the contours of the land. Her chest rose and fell with labored breaths as her tits giggled along with the gathering spasms of her over-taxed body. Finally, a long low groan escaped from the depths of her throat, her eyes rolled back and her skin began to glow with a deep pink blush. As she surrendered to her climax, her frame shook with the relentless, trembling contractions of pleasure. 

Then she fell to the floor with a damp splat. 

"You fucking bitch!" screamed Wanda as she turned from Tuli. "I told you not to move!" 

Molly flopped around on the floor as painful cramps clawed up and down her legs and the remains of her toe-curling orgasm echoed through her body. Wanda grabbed a red leather riding crop to begin thrashing Molly. Tuli restrained her. 

"Easy dear, I've got something for you," she said to Wanda as she handed her what looked like another strap-on. But this one had a bite guard on the base of a dildo with two straps to wrap around the back of a head. Dutifully, Wanda strapped it into her mouth, phallus out. 

Tuli and Wanda rolled Molly over and spread her legs. Wanda, on her knees, brought her head between the girl's thighs and began to alternate penetrating her pussy and ass with her face-cock. Behind her, Tuli set the rhythm by pumping a vigorous fuck into Wanda with her strap-on. Tuli twisted, turning to reach a nearby dildo and bring it to her own dark pucker. Roy watched as her face grimaced and body contorted until, finally, the black shaft was in and began moving easily inside her reluctant cavity. 

A few fellows applauded. "Christ! Their gonna use every fuckin' dildo in this place," whined the clerk somewhere to Roy's right. 

Looking around Roy saw every other man in the room had their cock out and was stroking heedlessly of his neighbors. Roy dropped his fly and liberated his erection. He began pulling his member slowly as he watched. 

Tuli's dissatisfaction with her strap-on was evident as she came to the realization that, although the cumbersome device looked good, it hit none of her pleasure spots. She pulled it off her body and cast it back into their toy pile. Rid of the constricting nylon straps holding the hard plastic firmly against her pudenda and feeling natural and womanly again, she sighed. 

She stood over the girls and, handing Wanda an acrylic double-header, she ordered them onto their backs. She wanted them impaled, ass to ass on the clear, hard shaft, she said. The girls were eager to comply. 

As they squirmed onto the toy, Tuli selected two more double-headers: flexible, latex, and creatively colored. She bent the purple one to a right angle and slid it into Wanda's pussy. She similarly bent the orange one and pushed it into Molly's pussy. Straddling their hips, she lowered herself onto the two upturned latex cock-heads. She eased Wanda's into her ass and let Molly's slip into her vagina. Going slowly at first she began slipping her hips back and forth, fucking the two girls as they writhed beneath her and grunted around their gags. Tuli began to rise and fall on each thrust, impaling herself in the pussy and ass as she fucked the girls. 

Roy watched as Tuli cycled her hips through a rolling motion, letting the flexible dildos push and pry at their holes as she balanced on those wicked heels. Every muscle in her body stood out with the effort. Her torso looked like it was carved out of buff colored marble. Roy gasped suddenly, realizing he had forgotten to breathe. That was his wife up there! His wife! She was so insanely hot, he couldn't stand it. Literally, he couldn't stand it as he realized his cock had begun to tingle and drip thick drops of pre-cum. With no time to spare, he jumped forward and brought his head to within inches of Tuli's big, bouncing tits. With a stroke and a tremulous rush, he flung his second load of the day onto her flesh, leaving shimmering pearls of himself to drip down and hang from her full and lovely breasts. 

As Roy backed away Tuli looked up at him with hot, feral eyes. There was an excited murmur rising all around. He saw the men circling in, their dicks in their hands as they stroked themselves to long-delayed climax. With a jolt of horror he realized his fellow perverts had taken his action as an invitation to do likewise. Thirteen hair-trigger cocks moved forward toward the grinding knot of womanhood on the porno-store floor. From the urgency of his own ejaculation he knew there was nothing he could do to stop them. He watched as a dozen dicks erupted onto the ladies. 

Molly was the most popular with his fellow perverts; more than half of them squatted and knelt around her gagged, upturned face to pump thick flows of sperm onto her young flesh. With her arms still held behind her back she could do nothing but let it rain down on her. A couple of guys squatted on either side of Wanda and she reached up to take their pricks in her little hands and start stroking. Roy mumbled something about "no touching", but they ignored him and came almost immediately, flooding Wanda's face with their heavy backlogs of pale spunk. 

Tuli, awkwardly balanced as she pivoted her pelvis on the cluster of dildos, was a more difficult target for the trembling and oozing cocks of the desperate jack-offs. However, a big, hairy, beer-belly bastard lost his patience. He got up close, reached behind Tuli's neck and bent her backwards. Her eyes were wide in surprise as his powerful hand held her. Her body was stretched tight and every find crease in her fine feminine frame was highlighted by the pink neon glow of some nearby displays. Her eyes went wide in surprise as she saw the huge man's gigantic cock; a surprise that doubled when an unreal flood of spunk poured across her face from it. The other men took advantage and popped out loads large and small across her face, tits and abdomen as she was held bent backwards and suspended by the big brute. Tuli froze and her breath caught in her chest. Held down, stretched out, impaled pussy and ass and dripping with the spunk of many strangers, she trembled and wailed as she began to climax. 

As Tuli sagged onto the girls beneath her and as the last of the horny customers spilled their seed onto the ladies' flesh, something caught Roy's eye. A straggler, probably ensconced in a back booth with a particularly noisy and nasty porno and unaware that the real thing was going on a few yards away, drifted up from the back. Roy saw the bald head with a fringe of ginger hair, the Hawaiian shirt, the khaki shorts. Roy watched in mute horror as the man peeked curiously over the shoulders of the clustered mass of men. Roy watched his face as he looked down to see his daughter on her back, ball-gag in her mouth, flushed and sweaty from multiple orgasms, thick puddles of sperm flowing across her skin. Molly's father reeled back, his eyes tortured with things that could never be unseen. Unnoticed by his daughter, whose glasses were askew and smeared with a thick film of man-seed, he carefully backed out of the room. 

Within seconds the store's alarms went off as the emergency exit in back was forced open. Everyone scattered. 

The girls, their limbs shaky and skin tacky, got themselves together with difficulty. Tuli pulled on her sundress, not bothering to search for her panties or remove her boots. Molly wiggled back into her shorts but couldn't find her bikini top. Roy randomly grabbed a tee-shirt off a rack of novelty shirts and tossed it to her. Wanda gathered their sex-toys, but the clerk began having second thoughts about surrendering so much pricey merchandise and began to argue with her, shouting over the sound of the alarm. He quickly relented when Wanda threatened to tear his dick off with a believable gush of vehemence. And so, haphazardly dressed and with two bags full of sex toys, they escaped to the car and pulled into traffic just as a police car rounded the corner two blocks away. Roy turned off the highway and began driving randomly down side streets. 

They drove in silence as the girls used up the box of Kleenex in the back wiping semen off their skin and blotting it out of their hair. Roy grasped the wheel tightly as he struggled to grapple with this strange new reality wherein his wife seduced young girls and subjected them to lesbian dominance exhibitions cumulating in cum baths. He looked over at Tuli, but she was staring quietly out the passenger's side window, lost in thought. Behind them, Wanda inspected her destroyed make-up in a compact while Molly was still trying to get clean, having taken the bulk of the drenching. When she finally looked up, her face was lively and ecstatic. 

"Holy shit! That. Was. Awesome. I don't even know how many times I came. And, like, squirtiest orgasms ever! Right? Holy shit." 

Wanda turned to Molly, her face set in a sneer and ready to say something nasty, but she cracked a smile instead. Bursting out in laughter, she said "Read your shirt, you stupid lezzie." 

The tee-shirt Roy had blindly grabbed for read, in large black letters, "I Love..." over a detailed line drawing of a wide open vulva. Molly began laughing hysterically along with Wanda as they rolled around on the back seat, clutching their stomachs, struggling for breath. Tuli and Roy were soon infected by their unhinged mirth. Roy had to pull over he was laughing so hard. They surrendered to the purging flood of hilarity as their sexual shock and moral exhaustion fed their hysteria. 

Finally their laughter subsided and they sat panting in their sex-stink as it rapidly flooded the car. 

"Now what?" asked Wanda. 

"I don't know," said Tuli. "That's going to be hard to top." 

Roy suddenly remembered Jimmy. He wondered how long it would be before he got back from Staten Island. He decided not to think about that now. 

"Well, how about lunch?" said Roy as he put the car in gear. "Our treat." 

"And then what?" said Wanda. 

"I don't know. I'm sure something will come up."

Greetings beloved readers, this is the last of a five part series. I will post each chapter about a week apart. Many thanks to fellow authors and occasional collaborators Friskee_cpl who gave me notes on the story and whose stories served as a vital inspiration for this tale. 

All characters are at least 18 years old 

* 

In their remaining years together -- a little more than forty five, as it would turn out - Roy and Tuli would eventually compile a vast vocabulary of inside jokes and favored phrases constituting a kind of private slang. Among this repertoire, their favorite would always remain the one that prompted vivid memories of the watershed event in the sexual history of their marriage; it was a single word: "caper". 

Caper: initially denoting a wild sexual adventure, it would evolve over the decades to eventually mean any sexual act. So ingrained would the slang become that their as yet undreamt-of children would pick it up too, using it ironically at first, but eventually as a handy code word when they sired impressionable children of their own. And so it would go for generations of Gilberts, all unknowingly referencing an off-hand comment that Roy made as noon rolled past on that fevered day and he looked down into the back seat of the car at the two, arguably stolen, shopping bags full of dildos, strap-ons, ball- gags and other assorted sex toys. 

"That was a hell of a caper that you girls just pulled," he said, shaking his head in lingering shocked disbelief. 

Tuli was sitting in the passenger's seat of the car with the door open and her legs stretched out. She was still wearing the thigh high leather boots she'd appropriated from the porno store along with the bags of sexual paraphernalia. She paused at dabbing her hair-line with a damp paper towel and smiled up at Roy. "A caper, huh? I like that." 

They were sitting in an obscure park that had little to offer other than a picnic table, an alarmingly filthy latrine, a functional drinking fountain and a boat ramp leading into the salt marshes behind Blaire Island. Tuli, Wanda and Molly were using coarse paper towels from the latrine to clean the spunk off their skin. Molly, who was the filthiest, was being helped by Wanda as she tried to rinse her hair under the spigot attached to the side of the drinking fountain. 

"Ow!" complained Molly. "That's cold... Watch your nails." 

"Quit fucking fidgeting then. Don't they teach you anything at that college of yours?" 

"They don't have any classes on how to wash cum out of our hair if that's what you mean!" 

Roy had found the park by accident as they cruised back street to avoid the cops and stopped so the girls could wash off at the tap. He wished he had found a place that didn't smell of festering shit and rotting bait, but at least it was private. He was glad for that, especially when Molly and Wanda took their shirts off and started splashing each other with cold tap water in the hot sun. 

Roy looked at Tuli, expecting her to tell the girls to settle down, but he could tell from her face that her mind was far, far away. It wasn't a dreamy look, it was pensive, brooding. 

"Everything OK?" he asked. 

"What?" she asked, pulling herself back from the deepest corners of her mind. 

"You seem... upset." 

"Oh. Sorry." 

"Is something wrong?" 

"No. Don't worry about it. It's stupid." 

"Oh come on babe, I think I've earned a little honesty. I'm dealing with our experiment pretty well, aren't I? I think I'm even starting to like it." 

"Oh really?" she asked. 

"What? You think I'm not?" 

"Well, you seem eager enough to share me with other girls, but..." 

"I just let a dozen guys jack off on you!" 

"Well," she paused to consider her words. "I had a great time, but I was kind of hoping you'd have those guys... I was hoping you'd take charge and have them - you know - do more." 

"WHAT!?" 

"See. It's stupid." 

"You said 'no touching'. It was like rule number two or something!" 

"That's the thing. I was hoping you'd... See, it's stupid and embarrassing, but I have this fantasy..." 

"Oh?" 

"No. Actually, let's drop it. I'm not comfortable discussing this." 

"I've done a shitload of stuff I wasn't comfortable with in the last couple of days. Don't pull that crap on me." 

Tuli didn't answer right away. Roy looked back and Wanda and Molly who were now sitting topless in the sun on the picnic table. Wanda was re-braiding Molly's wet hair and they were singing "Tik-Tok" together. Finally Tuli spoke up. 

"You're right Bubbs. You're right. I owe you some honesty. Can I explain with a story? It's from my Wild Days and it's pretty goddamned slutty." 

"Oh?" 

"I know I've kept you in the dark about that part of my life... It's just that I've found out that guys say they want to hear about the dirty stuff I've done but they don't, not really. They get panicky and self-conscious and start acting like total pricks. Before long they're treating me like shit..." A tear escaped her eye and hung on her cheek. 

"I would never..." 

"I know Bubbs. I know. That's why I'm telling you this. I think you've earned it. Shit, after the last couple of days I feel pretty confident I married the coolest guy ever," she smiled at him as he squatted in the gravel next to her. She reached out and placed her finger on his lips. "So just shut up and let me talk... or I'm not going to be able to get through this." 

Roy nodded silently. His stomach began to grow queasy. 

"OK. This was at the end of my junior year of college. Classes were over and I was just hitting the parties and hooking up a lot." 

Roy nodded silently. 

"I met this one guy, his name was Fred or Frank or something, I don't remember. He went to Princeton, typical Ivy League prick trolling for tail at the state university. But I wasn't too picky back then and he was a pretty decent looking guy so I let him chat me up. 

"He was pretty full of himself and seemed to think that if he kept casually mentioning all the cool crap his parents had bought him I'd eventually just throw my legs open and beg him to fuck me. I was playing along, but when he mentioned he had his own yacht I accused him of being full of shit. Before I knew it he was driving me down to a marina in Atlantic Highlands to show me. Sure enough, he had a sloop down there. It wasn't huge, but it was definitely cool: very swank." 

Roy wanted to ask if she'd screwed the Princeton asshole on his boat, but he knew the answer. Tuli had an odd fascination with boats, ships and sea-craft. Of course she screwed him. He kept his mouth shut. 

"So, the next morning this guy asks me if I want to go along when he sails up to Martha's Vineyard. He really was a complete prick but... how could I say no? He takes me back to my apartment at school so I can pack some stuff and he picks me up that evening but when we get back to the boat one of his buddies is waiting for us! The buddy's name was Dan or Don or something and I could tell by the look in his eye that he was expecting some action from me too. Now, ordinarily I didn't give it up if it seemed like some guy I hadn't slept with before was expecting it way too obviously, but I really wanted to sail up the coast so I went along with it. Besides, I was totally into a three-ways with two guys, even if they were both assholes... 

"You doing OK with this Bubbs?" 

Roy nodded his head even though the news that his wife had once whored herself out to two guys in exchange for a boat ride made him feel distinctly ill. 

"Well, good... because here's the nasty part. The next night we anchored at some marina in the Hamptons. We were out in the bay and this launch full of identical trust-fund assholes comes up along side. Fred or Frank or whatever his name was introduces me and they're all leering at me like... well, I could tell what they were expecting to happen. They start making these comments like, wouldn't I be more comfortable without my bikini and would I like to move down to the cabin? I was feeling like I was in waaaay over my head. Plus none of those fuckers even asked me if I wanted to be gangbanged, they were just assuming the Turkish slut with the big tits would be willing to fuck them all." 

She paused. Roy was finding it hard to breathe. 

"So, we go down to the cabin and I'm freaking out. I tell them I need to get some fresh air before I make my entrance and suggest they should be naked when I come back. So I go up to the deck, slip quietly over the side and swim to shore. Never saw any of those assholes again and, after that, my Wild Phase just kind of petered out... well, after I got home anyway. I had to do a few 'favors' in the course of hitchhiking back home." 

"So you escaped?" confirmed Roy as he exhaled with relief. 

"Yeah, I escaped. But, the funny thing is that I still think about it all the time. What if I'd stayed? What would it be like fucking a bunch of guys at once? I fantasize about it all the time. I was hoping it was about to happen under the boardwalk last night before those cops showed up. I was kind of hoping you'd let it happen at the porno store. 

"But you... you said no touching," repeated Roy. 

"That's the sick part, Roy. I want it to be a little coercive. I want you to make me do something that I'm too chickenshit to try on my own." 

"Um... holy shit Tuli. I... I didn't know." 

"How could you know, Bubbs? It's not fair for me to expect a decent guy like you to guess the depths of my... depravity. But you asked..." 

Just then the sound of truck tires on gravel came drifting to them through the cluster of pines that forced a bend in the road leading to the park. Tuli shouted "Someone's coming! Get your shirts on girls!" 

Molly and Wanda pulled their tops on before the truck pulling a trailer with a flat-bottomed johnboat pulled into the parking lot. With confused faces, the two old men inspected the odd crowd of provocatively dressed women as they began to maneuver the trailer into the water. 

"I'm hungry," said Wanda as she skipped up. 

"I can't go back to the resort with this on!" complained Molly looking down at the shirt Roy had grabbed for her in their rush out of the porno shop. It read "I Luv..." with a detailed drawing of wide open vulva. "If my dad saw me in something like this they'd shit a brick." 

Roy recalled Molly's father wandering in from the back of the store, peeking over the shoulders of the horny crowd, seeing his daughter sprawled on the floor and running off in shocked horror. Molly had no idea of course. Roy fought back the urge to vomit. 

"We'll find someplace in town that sells tee-shirts and get something less alarming for Molly. Then we'll get some food, our treat," announced Tuli. "You OK with that Mr. Gilbert?" 

But Roy didn't respond. Looking at the old men backing their boat into the marsh he felt a sudden wave of envy wash over him. An afternoon of tending crab traps and sipping tepid beer sounded mighty good right then. But when he looked into their crinkled, weathered faces he saw the envy returned: old men remembering a time when hot young, pussy was a possibility and a goal, not just a long expired fantasy. 

"OK," said Roy as he got into the car and started the engine. "Let's go girls. We've got time for another caper." 

Tuli laughed. "Caper," she repeated. "I like that a lot." 

*** 

Half and hour later, from his spot at the rail of the amusement pier, Roy could look down the length of the crowded beach as it stretched away to the south. The crowds were at their early-afternoon peak: mostly vacationers and day trippers from Philadelphia and New York looking for some easy sun, sand and sea. They clustered in loose knots around coolers and umbrellas, all showing more skin than not, frequently to their disadvantage. 

A laugh from one of the young mothers sitting in the shade of the nearby corndog stand brought Roy's attention back to the pier. There were two of them: puffy, pasty and poorly maintained. Exchanging a narrow-eyed glare over the top their oversized sunglasses, they were bonding over a little shared contempt, glaring hatefully at something approaching up the pier from the direction of the boardwalk. 

"Oh. My. God. Look at that whore." said one in disbelief. 

"I know!" said the other. "Total whore. You'd think they'd keep that sort of thing away from where families with children are trying to enjoy themselves." 

Without turning away from the rail Roy correctly guessed they were discussing Tuli. Her tight, low-cut sundress and the high leather boots she was still wearing looked more than a little trashy. He Turned and smiled broadly. Damn she looked hot. She wore trashy very, very well. 

"Hey wifey!" he called to her, loud enough to let the two mothers know to keep their fat mouths shut. 

"Don't distract me!" she said without looking up as she gingerly stepped towards him. "These stupid heels keep wanting to slip right between the eff-ing planks." 

"Then take them off." 

"I'd get splinters. I hate splinters." 

"Well, the boots look awesome at least." 

"Why don't men ever get turned on by anything easy or comfortable?" 

"I like it when you're nude. That's both." 

"You're so sweet... and so unhelpful." She gave him a peck on the cheek as she finally reached his spot at the rail. 

"You could buy some cheap flip-flops or something," he suggested. 

She shrugged. "We both know I'll probably never wear these outside again. I figured I should show them off while I can. I just wish they weren't so fricken hot." 

"Where are the girls?" 

"Molly found a new shirt but now Wanda insists on wearing the 'I Luv Pussy' one," said Tuli as she rolled her eyes. "They wanted to play skee-ball and, since I needed a break from those two, I gave them a twenty and told them to meet us here." 

"It's weird, I thought Wanda was going to kill Molly this morning but now they're like sisters." 

"Yeah, wanting to kill each other one minute and best friends the next... that sounds like sisters all right." She sat on the bench next to where he stood, crossing her legs tightly and pulling her hem as far down her thighs as she could. "I wish I hadn't lost my undies. If I topple over or sit wrong I'm going to give everyone quite a show." 

"Yeah, we wouldn't want that," he said. 

"There are kids around. I have my limits," she said sounding vaguely annoyed. 

The two young mothers moved away with a nasty backwards glance and a shared whisper. Tuli sighed. "Were they calling me a slut as I walked up?" 

"I don't know, I couldn't hear over the rollercoaster," lied Roy, motioning towards a car full of screaming kids as it banked around the near turn on the other side of the corndog kiosk. 

"Trust me, that's what they were saying. I could see it in their faces. They hate my slutty guts." 

"Don't worry what those doughy bitches think, babe, I love you." 

"Oh I can handle their contempt... Comes with the territory; it's just like old times in fact." 

"Back when you used to be a slut?" 

"I think we can drop the 'used to be', Bubbs," She sighed. 

"Are you still feeling down about the... um..." 

"My gangbang fantasy?" 

"Yeah. That." 

"I'll be fine Roy. Some fantasies are just too weird or dangerous or impossible to be anything more than daydreams. We might have got pretty close, but even I can tell it's a bad idea. I just need to stop thinking with my... Oh no. Now what?" 

Roy looked up to see Molly hurrying towards them. She looked worried. 

"I forgot my phone at your place and my family has been looking for me." 

"Oh shit. I'm sorry Molly." 

"Mom is usually pretty cool. I mean, she knows I'm sexually active and she's the one who took me to get birth control. But she's gonna totally freak out about what I've been up to today." 

"How could she even know?" asked Tuli. Roy cringed inwardly. 

"Because Mom sent my brother to search the boardwalk and he found me and Wanda. That bitch told him we were lesbian lovers!" 

"Where are Wanda and your brother?" asked Roy. 

Molly spun around and didn't see them following. "Shit! We gotta find them. She'll eat Tommy alive." 

Tuli sighed. "OK, let's go back to the arcade and rescue your brother from Wanda." 

Again Tuli began gingerly picking her way across the treacherous planks while Molly buzzed impatiently around her like a tall, red-headed puppy. By the time they were half way there Wanda and Tommy appeared from the noisy gloom of the arcade. Wanda was smiling wickedly from ear to ear. Tommy looked embarrassed, confused, pleased and flushed. Roy knew instantly what had happened. 

"I popped your brother's cherry in the toilet!" announced Wanda. "Twenty seconds of pure paradise. Right kiddo?" she laughed as she punched him in the arm. 

Tommy looked away embarrassed and his pink face went beet red. 

"Congratulations young man," said Tuli as if handing out a good grade on a test to a student. 

"Come on Tommy, lets get out of here," said Molly. She nearly shoved Tommy off his feet as she pushed him towards the general direction of the town. 

"Um, Yeah... OK..." said Tommy awkwardly. 

"You guys can compare notes on the way back... since I've fucked you both," taunted Wanda. 

Molly didn't respond, she only glared at Wanda briefly as she and her brother walked away. Her brother handed her his phone and she turned away to make the necessary call to her anxious mother. 

"That was fun," said Wanda. The 'I Luv Pussy' tee-shirt hung on her like a demented mini-dress and prompted quite a few double-takes as people walked past. 

"Come on. Let's find someplace to eat," said Roy. "I have a feeling I should probably find some place that sells oysters." 

"Oysters? Why?" asked Wanda. 

"I'll explain on the way," said Tuli. 

*** 

It was nearly four in the afternoon as they finally walked up to Roy and Tuli's cabin. Roy and Wanda each clutched a shopping bag full of sex-toys to their chest as Tuli walked unsteadily up the pea-gravel path in her stiletto heeled boots. 

"I'm starting to really hate these fucking boots," she said for the fourth or fifth time. 

"Ah, the Gilberts have returned," said a low voice with a vaguely British accent. 

Roy looked up from watching Tuli's careful footsteps through the gravel to find Mike from Kenya standing up from where he had been sitting on their front stoop. His white smile spilt his impossibly dark face as his eyes drank in Tuli with unconcealed lust. Roy noticed a bump visible through Mike's close-cropped hair where he'd banged his head against underside of boardwalk last night. 

"Mike?" said Tuli. "What are you doing here?" 

"You mentioned you were staying at this particular resort and you told me your names. You weren't very difficult to find. I thought I'd drop by to apologize for abandoning you last night." 

"Yeah, you did scamper off kind of hastily when those cops showed up." 

"Yes," he smile abashedly. "It was not my finest hour." 

"Who's this?" asked Wanda, stepping out from behind Roy, her head tilted like a curious kitten. 

"Wanda this is our friend Mike. Mike, Wanda." 

Wanda stepped forward to look Mike up and down. Her eyes were wide and lively. "Hey, I remember you. You were dancing with Tuli at the club last night. Oooo, you guys got nasty after we left, right?" 

"More or less," said Roy. 

Wanda stepped up close to Mike but he shied away. This amused her so she reached towards him with the left hand. Mikes face twisted up in fear at the sight of her heavily tattooed arm coming towards him and twisted away again. 

"What's with him?" she said. 

"I'm sorry... But your friend, she isn't a... a witch, is she?" 

"What if I am?" said Wanda, stepping forward again. Mischief made her eyes sparkle.  

===

"Oh come on Mike, you're studying to be a doctor!" laughed Tuli. "Surely you don't believe in..." 

"It is part of my culture. Witches are much feared. Please understand," he said with increasing panic. His voice cracked as he pleaded, "Please make her stop!" 

Roy and Tuli couldn't help but laugh as Wanda threw herself at Mike and latched onto him with her arms around his shoulders and legs around his torso. 

"I'll swallow your soul!" she cackled as she playfully bit his neck. 

Mike screamed in terror as he spun around frantically. "No! No! Get her off! Ahhhhh!!!" 

Unfortunately, that was when Jimmy showed up. And not just Jimmy; he was followed by three other muscle bound dudes, all seemingly stamped from the same beefy mold. 

"What the FUCK!" said Jimmy as he appeared around the front of Roy and Tuli's cabin. 

Wanda let go of Mike immediately. For the first time Roy could remember, she looked genuinely scared. 

"You're fucking niggers now! Jesus fucking Christ Wanda, I fucking knew this type of shit would happen once Obama became president." Jimmy looked from Wanda to Roy to Tuli. He looked betrayed and very, very angry. 

"I'm not involved in this!" cried Mike as he turned and ran away. Like yard dogs aroused by a fleeing cat, Jimmy's three meaty friends took off after him; pursuing out of pure instinct. 

"I was just..." began Wanda. 

Jimmy's arm flashed out. His fist hit Wanda full in the face and she flew backwards past Roy like a rag doll. Instinctually, Roy began to turn to help Wanda, but when Tuli launched herself at Jimmy, Wanda was forgotten. 

Tuli charged, dodged a slap and was able to punch Jimmy once in the ribs but Jimmy got hold of her hair and shook her off her feet. As she dropped to her knees in the grass, her ass and pussy peeked from under her dress and the straps fell from her shoulders. 

Roy attacked, finally determined to smash Jimmy's fucking face, but as he was still pulling back his fist Jimmy jabbed fast with his left and popped him hard in the mouth. He tasted blood as he fell backwards on his ass. 

Roy recovered quickly, shaking away the stars that swarmed in the edges of his vision as he jumped up. He advanced more carefully, looking for an opening. Still holding Tuli with a fistful of hair, Jimmy used her as a shield. She clawed and screamed as he held her at arm's length. The three parallel scratches down Jimmy's face showed he had let her get too close at least once. 

Jimmy and Roy traded a series of ineffectual punches while Tuli tried to get a leg free for a kick, but only succeeded in burying her left heel into the sod. Reaching around his wife, Roy threw a hook that Jimmy easily knocked away and that left him open for Jimmy, who connected solidly with a roundhouse to the side of Roy's face. Roy dropped to the ground again, hard. 

He rolled and tried to steady himself enough to stand. But when he looked up he saw Jimmy struggling to stay upright with Molly on his back, legs around his hips and her right arm wrapped tightly around his neck. Her face screwed up with effort as she squeezed his neck between her bicep and forearm while pushing forward on his head. Jimmy released Tuli and charged backwards, attempting to knock Molly off by smashing backwards into tree-trunks and cabin siding. But Molly hung on. As Jimmy struggled he grew slower and weaker until, finally, he dropped heavily into a sitting position. Molly continued to hold him, only relaxing the pressure when he went limp and rolled onto his side. 

"Jesus!" said Roy. 

"Women's defense seminar at school," panted Molly proudly. "I did pretty well." 

Roy remembered Wanda flying backwards like a rag doll. He turned around looking for her. "Where's Wanda?" he asked. 

"I was coming back from the lodge when I saw her driving away in your car so I ran over to see what was going on. I saw him beating the shit out of you two so I thought I'd settle him down." 

Roy checked his pockets. His keys were gone. They must have been flung out the first time Jimmy knocked him down. Now Wanda, of all people, had his car: fucking wonderful. 

"Well, thanks for saving us," said Roy, feeling a little less than manly at having been rescued from a fist fight by a nineteen year old girl. 

"Yeah, thanks," said Tuli. She was sitting crumpled on the ground, holding down the hem of her short dress to keep her pussy out of sight. Her hair had been whipped into a wild mess and her eyes were red from crying. Roy hated to admit it, but the sight of her in this vulnerable and disheveled state was a huge turn-on. He felt dark, atavistic urges tug at him: caveman urges. 

A crowd was spontaneously assembling around the periphery of the aftermath of the battle. They looked on the panting foursome still spread out across the ground with unconcealed interest but they kept their distance when the noticed the quantity of sex toys strewn about in a wide circle around the scene of battle. 

"Unggh," groaned Jimmy from within Molly's sleeper hold. Tuli instinctively scuttled away like a crab. Roy got up into a crouching position, ready to jump in if Jimmy should leap to the attack. 

"Easy, Beefy," Molly warned him. 

"Holy shit. Did you just... Did you actually take me down?" asked Jimmy. 

"Yeah. Sleeper hold, bi-otch." She smiled a proud grin. 

"Fuck, I'm impressed. Really. No one's beat me in a fight since I was fourteen." 

Molly released him. He smiled up at her. 

"It was kinda fun, riding you like bull," she said. 

He laughed. "You should try riding up front next time." 

She held his stare, "Anytime, Beef." 

For the only time Roy could recall, Jimmy seemed at a loss for words. "Ummmm, you wanna..." Jimmy let his eyes flit back to his cabin. "See my cabin." 

Molly looked around at the confused-looking crowd: none of her family were in sight. "Sure!" she said enthusiastically. 

"Help! Help! I've been captured by American red necks!" cried Mike's voice as Jimmy's three meaty friends escorted him back. They had his hands clenched firmly behind his back. His red and gray polo shirt was badly torn and his knee had a nasty looking scrape. As the group reached the growing crowd Jimmy's friend froze. 

"Jimmy? What the fuck?" said one of them as they looked down at him lying in the grass in Molly's arms among the dildo's and butt plugs. 

"Oh, shit. I forgot you guys," said Jimmy. Turning to Molly he explained, "These are my bros. Um, there's Paulie, Tony and that's Sean. I told them if they followed me down her I'd get them laid, but Wanda went jungle fever on me with that asshole and I'm guessing Tooley ain't interested any more. I, um... don't suppose you'd be interested ..." 

Molly looked suddenly horrified. "All four of you!? I don't think so, no way." 

Jimmy shrugged at his friends. "Sorry boys, you heard her. Now I hope you excuse me and Maggie 'cause we have some shit that we gotta take care of, y'know, alone." 

"My name is Molly, Jimmy," corrected Molly. 

"Oh yeah, right, Molly. Whatever." 

"What about this guy?" said Paulie, the one holding Mike's arm tightly behind his back. 

Jimmy scanned the audience of disbelieving faces. "Better let him go." 

"Please. Yes. Let me go!" 

"Fuck. This is bullshit," said Sean. 

Roy thought so too. It all seemed so wrong. He and Tuli were left crumpled in the grass while Asshole of the Year Jimmy was taking Molly back to his bed, probably to gape her asshole mercilessly like he'd done to Wanda this morning. Oh, and psycho-waif Wanda had his car somewhere: great, just fucking great. 

As Jimmy escorted Molly back to his cabin the three disappointed weightlifters released Mike and milled about looking lost, abandoned and betrayed. The crowd seemed to sense that any action that was likely to transpire was done but seemed reluctant to drift away. Mike stood on the grass next to Roy rubbing his shoulders. 

"Are you OK?" asked Mike. "You have quite a bit of blood on your face." 

Roy touched his lips and looked at the smear of blood on his fingers. He looked up and saw the three meatheads moving closer, trying to get a peek up Tuli's skirt. She noticed it too and squirmed in embarrassment. Except when her eye caught Roy's he could see it wasn't embarrassment that was making her squirm. 

It hit him like an epiphany: a eureka moment. Roy finally understood what Tuli really wanted. She'd been hinting and showing him and even straight up telling him for the last two days, but only now did he get it. The play-humiliation against the window, the sweaty hate-fuck with Jimmy yesterday morning, the eagerness with which she'd submitted to the two cops under the boardwalk, the dominance she'd exhibited on Wanda and Molly: it all neatly clicked into place like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. She wanted the thrill of hot, filthy sex again - the lusty stares of strangers, the feel of unfamiliar hands touching her flesh, the gush of hot cum into her body - but she didn't want the responsibility, heart ache and stigma affixed to unattached women of vast sexual appetite. She wanted to be led into the acts she desired but feared. She wanted Roy to make her a slut again, to remove the torment of sexual free-will which wasn't really free at all. With Roy behind her she could be a willing wife rather than another filthy cum dumpster. No wonder she understood Molly's desire for coercion that had seemed to Roy to be so frighteningly close to abuse. 

He wondered how much of Tuli's respect he had frittered away through his thick- headed obtuseness. He had to prove to her that he could be her strong and loving, but sexually demanding, man. He had to show her he could push her, dominate her, control her. As he thought of fucking her up against the window, or of Jimmy nailing her ass with her arms tied behind her back, or of her, Wanda and Molly squirming together on the floor of the sex toy shop, he realized he might even need to show he was willing to humiliate her. 

His mind crackling with uncomfortable but blindingly clear truths, Roy stood. 

"Could you help me up," sighed Tuli to Roy. 

"No," he said curtly. She looked up at him with surprise and he added: "Fuckmeat." 

He saw the pupils of her dark eyes dilate. 

Roy spoke calmly but firmly. "I want you to stay down there. I want you to crawl on your hands and knees back inside and put that on," Roy pointed to a package that contained some kind of back body stocking thingy one of the girls had taken from the store. 

Tuli's looked up at him, confused. "What..." 

"Did I say you could speak?" he demanded. 

Her eyes were sparkling with interest as she shook her head. She got up on her knees in front of him. 

"I said hands and knees." 

Tuli dropped down onto her hands in the grass. She reached around quickly to tug down the hem of her skirt. 

"And you are not to touch your hem." 

"Yes sir," she said, blushing. 

"Here," he said and shoved the package with the body stocking thingy into her mouth. "Go on now, get inside and get ready." She turned slowly towards the door and looked back with livid embarrassment as her exposed ass and pussy came into view under the hem of her too-short-for-crawling-around-on-all-fours sundress. Some of the lingering gawkers looked away in shock, many others stared in delight. 

"Mike, you still want to fuck my wife?" 

"I..." he looked around at the shock-faced crowd, whispered: "Yes" 

"How about you guys?" Roy said to Jimmy's three friends. "Think you can behave yourselves?" 

"You're going to let us..." Sean said as he looked over at Tuli. She had reached the stoop now. Her labia looked dusky and engorged; distinctly damp. Sean mouthed the words fuck her, while nodding her direction. 

"If you can act like men and not racist assholes, yes." 

"Hey, I'm cool. My sister's baby's father is a ni... an African American," said Sean. 

"Shit, I was in the navy, I fucked chicks with black guys before," said Tony. 

"I'm cool. I'm cool," said Paulie. 

"Then help me pick up this shit," said Roy indicating the scattered sex toys. 

"Dude, what are you doin' over there!" came Jimmy's voice from the front stoop of his porch. Molly stood half in, half out of the front door to his cabin. She looked impatient. 

Roy looked at Jimmy. So did Tuli, briefly, as she shuffled up the steps to the front door, flashing a glare of raw hate with her dark, expressive eyes. Obviously there was, or had been anyway, something about Jimmy that aroused her, but after today she looked like she'd rather do almost anything than let him touch her again. Unfortunately, that made Jimmy perfect for Roy's plan. After all, reluctance and coercion seemed to be big parts of what turned Tuli on. 

Roy swallowed his hatred and shouted back, "I was thinking, I still owe you a turn at my wife after this morning." 

On the faces of the remaining crowd every jaw dropped wide in disbelief. 

Tuli looked around. Anger, arousal, reluctance and embarrassment blazed rapidly across her face as she looked at Jimmy then at Roy. She was at the top of the steps to the cabin's front door now. Roy walked up and slapped her across the ass. "Go on, get in there," he said brusquely. 

As she paused to open the door he let his hand rest on her ass. He let it slip down her cleft and into her pussy where his fingers glided along the creases between her lips. She was wet; so very, very wet. He pushed his fingers forward so the tips slipped up under her clitoral hood and drew them slowly across her sensitive, distended bud. Her body tensed suddenly and Roy saw her ass blush vibrantly. Her whole body shuddered as she heaved a shallow gasp. Roy stood back, shocked that he'd just made Tuli come by barely touching her clit. 

When he turned back around, every watching face was blank with disbelief. Roy put the tips of his fingers in his mouth and licked them free of Tuli's delicious nectar with a leering smile. 

'Ho-lee-crap!" drawled one of the meatheads. 

"Me next, huh?" laughed another. 

"Man, you guys are..." began Jimmy as he strode up. Roy gestured for him to shut up. A managerial looking guy was approaching from the direction of the lodge. He didn't look happy. 

"What's going on here?" sputtered the resort manager as he looked around at the debris field of scattered sex toys. He looked hard at the cabin's open front door but Tuli had already crawled inside and out of view. 

"Nothing," answered Roy, insolently. "These gentlemen were about to help me pick up some of my wife's... souvenirs," he said, gesturing towards Mike, the meatheads and Jimmy. They all nodded in agreement and got quickly to work. Molly joined in, looking confused, annoyed and more than a little worried that her family would show up to find her picking up dildos with the married dude next store and a bunch of body builders. 

The manager sputtered, "I got reports that..." 

"Easy friend, we're cleaning up our mess. We'll be out of your hair in a minute." 

The manager glowered at them as they rapidly scooped up armloads of sexual paraphernalia. Finally, Roy showed Mike, Tony, Paulie, Sean, Jimmy and Molly in through the front door as the manager stood with his arms crossed across his chest. Roy smiled a "good evening" at him, but the manager's expression made it clear that his pleasantry would not be returned. Roy shrugged and shut the door. 

"Hey man, lemme get some weed before we get started," said Jimmy. 

"Y'know what, fuck your weed, Jimmy. Either help me screw my wife or just get the fuck out." 

"Hey bro, you're not still mad about..." 

"Just shut up Jimmy." 

Jimmy opened his mouth to protest, but his eyes shifted to a fresh vision behind Roy. Roy turned and saw Tuli in the doorway. She was ready for them. 

The black mesh body suit was really more of a black mesh singlet with satin garters supporting black mesh stockings. The ensemble left her pussy and ass exposed and she had not supplemented any panties to rectify the gap. She had supplemented her outfit with the black velvet choker she knew drove Roy wild and with her shiny, black, four-inch heeled pumps which clicked alluringly as she strutted into the room. 

'Whoa," they all said together. 

"Fuckin' A" said Jimmy. 

Poor Molly looked sad and forgotten. 

Tuli's face was stoic, ready for the next order from her man, willing to pursue his wishes no matter how vile or horrible. But Roy could read Tuli well, He saw the secret smile behind her eyes; the smile that told him she had figured out his game; the smile that dared him to push her as far and further than he through wise. Bring it on Bubbs, dared her eyes. I can take it. 

"Very nice," said Roy. He had to struggle to keep from saying it with too much enthusiasm. "But don't you think you should apologize to our friend Jimmy for the way you've behaved this evening?" 

Tuli's eyes flashed with anger, but she quickly gained control of herself and nodded. "Yes sir," she said. She walked up to Jimmy and got to her knees in front of him with her head bowed. "I've very sorry for my conduct, sir," she said with almost believable contrition. 

"Oh Yeah?" he sneered. "Fuckin' prove it." He pulled his cock from his shorts, it was already stiff. 

Tuli never looked up into his eyes as she brought his shaft to her mouth, but she did her job no less conscientiously. She lapped around the head, nibbled lightly up the sides and slid it back into her mouth. After a short while long strands of precum were stretching from the slit on his glans to her glossy, sperm coated lips. Jimmy was obviously struggling not to shoot too fast. 

"Shit bitch," he groaned as he pushed her away. "I'm going to have to stop you there or I ain't gonna last for the main event." 

Tuli looked up at Roy with large eyes mimicking subservience, but telegraphing victory. She taunted him without word or gesture. Is that all you got, Bubbs. 

Roy turned to Jimmy's friends. "Where you boys from?" 

Paulie answered for them. "Me and Sean are from Staten Island, Tony's from Brooklyn." 

"You guys want to fuck my wife?" 

They nodded eagerly. 

"Let me get my cam-coder," he said. "I'm going to want a memento of this." 

"Awesome," said Jimmy. "I'll want a copy of this." 

"You don't get shit Jimmy. You're lucky to even be here. Now shut up and stay shut up," said Roy. Jimmy flinched back like he'd been slapped. Molly laughed a little truncated giggle. Roy handed the camera to her. 

"Would you?" he asked. She nodded as she took the camera. 

The three big men gathered close and arrayed themselves around Tuli in a tight semi-circle. She visibly sagged under a surge of lust as three huge cocks were pulled out and brought to her face. Grabbing two and sucking the third, Tuli began to work. She attacked the task enthusiastically, even greedily, as she plunged her face down onto the fat cocks and began sliding her tongue up and down their veiny shafts. Her hands stroked and squeezed their cocks as she tried to maneuver them closer. Finally she began taking two of the beasts into her mouth at a time. The sight of her face surrounded and penetrated by those massive rods caused Roy's stomach to turn over even as it caused his cock to plump to full erection. She cycled through them, hands and mouth, until they too were leaking thick flows of pre-cum and twitching in desperate restraint of their pending release. 

"Go ahead and come in her mouth. I want you guys to last when you fuck her." 

"Mmmmm," groaned Tuli. She had her lips around two of their fat heads and was fluttering her tongue beneath them. 

"Oooh!" said one. "Nnngah" said the other. Their cocks started pumping a massive double barrel load of seed that gushed from the corners of her mouth in thick gets. She swallowed as much as she could but didn't catch half of it. She was a gooey mess as the third bodybuilder took handfuls of her hair and began roughly face fucking her. His ass clenched up and he pumped his load down her rapidly swallowing throat. Tuli sat back and gulped air as she wiped some of the cum from her face. She looked feral, her hair wild again, her eyes dilated.  

===

Roy pushed her forward onto her hands and knees. He pushed her down so her chin met the floor. He spread her ass and probed lightly at her pucker. She groaned. He saw a bottle of oil across the room, but he had a worse idea. Puckering his lips, he spat on her sphincter. He looked up and Mike was looking at him in perverse fascination. 

"Help me with this. I'm a little dry." Obediently Mike stepped up and spat on Tuli's asshole. Roy did again too. He pushed a finger into her and she groaned more loudly. "Still need some more," he said. They all joined in raining spit on Tuli's ass. She writhed beneath the horrible rain as Roy pushed two, then three, fingers in her. Molly hovered close, recording it all. 

"OK Mike, fuck that mess," said Roy. 

Roy took the camera from Molly as Mike lined up his cock and began slowly pushing it into Tuli's guts. She squirmed and barked little truncated cries as he filled her. Roy got in close, filming each punishing inch as it disappeared inside his wife. 

"Oh!" gasped Mike. "It's so tight. She is so hot." Finally he paused, balls deep in Tuli's ass. 

Roy scanned the crowd with his camera. Every eye watched greedily; except for Molly's, she was now on her knees in front of the body builders, urging them back to erection, her trepidation at handling so many cocks blasted away in the lust charged air of the little cabin. 

As Roy panned the camera around the room he let the auto focus slip past the men waiting their turn at Tuli and rest on the big picture window. There were faces, many faces, all looking in. The crowd outside still lingered, looking in now, watching his wife's willing debasement. 

Roy was playing director now. He ordered Tuli into Jimmy's lap. She straddled him as he bathed her tits with his tongue. Bring his cock to her pussy, she sank onto his cock. Roy ordered Mike back into her ass. Tuli moaned lividly they filled her. "You like that?" he asked her. 

"Mmmmm." 

"How about you Jimmy? Can you feel Mike's cock in there with you?" 

"Heeey. Shut the fuck up man." 

"Ohhhh. Ahhhh. Oh God. Oh holy fuck!" cried out Tuli as she came again. 

Sean entered the action with a newly rehardened cock and guided her mouth to his shaft. Soon his two buddies were joining in too, bringer her hands to their expectant cocks. Roy licked his lips with desire and anxiety as he recorded his wife taking all five of them at once. He felt hands on his fly, a mouth on his erection. He panned down to catch Molly wink up at him as she began sucking his cock. 

Roy and Tuli would watch that video many times of the next couple of years. It was with great sadness when they finally destroyed it the week after the birth of their first child. It was just too dangerous to have around, they had decided. But by that point they had it memorized anyway. Roy could recite the action by heart: how Mike came deep in Tuli's ass and dropped out; how Paulie took his place; how they all had to rearrange themselves so Jimmy could climb out from underneath and come in her mouth; how Sean and Tony double-stuffed her pussy, sending her into the noisiest orgasm Roy had ever heard; how they finished, her on her back on the coffee table with one in her pussy, one in her mouth and one between her tits; how she arose damp and sticky with the fluids of sex but with a face radiant and eyes wild and satisfied. The only thing he hadn't recorded was his own orgasm in Molly's mouth as he filmed his wife's first gangbang. 

But finally, the sexual marathon reached its conclusion. The air was tacky with the smell of sex, sweat and ass. Everyone seemed dazed, disbelieving of what had just transpired. All except Molly, who seemed to have fled after getting Roy off. He couldn't blame her, she had seemed pretty pissed off at being so thoroughly ignored. 

"Thank you very much, Gilberts," said Mike. "I'd better go before your redneck friends beat me up again." 

Roy shrugged, Mike had a point. He watched as Mike kissed Tuli once on her crusty, sperm-flecked lips and made a quick retreat out the back door. They never saw him again. 

"Hey," said Jimmy. "I only came once. Lemme take another poke." 

"No Jimmy. We're done. In fact, I thought I told you to leave when you finished." 

"Hey, no need to be a dick." 

"Whatever, Jimmy. Just get the fuck out of my cabin. Now." 

"Y'know, I ain't even gonna be pissed at you bro. You got a smokin' hot slut wife, you party hardy and in a fight you can take a punch and stay on the attack. You're hard-core fuckin' player, man. I gotta respect that. Here's my card, if you and the missus are ever in the city and want to party, give me a call. Seriously dude, I know some crazy cats in the city." 

He tried to hand Roy a card, but Roy didn't take it. Jimmy let it drop onto the end table. Roy said nothing. 

"Well, since me and Wanda Jean are through, I guess I'm gonna blow outta this fucking cemetery and just go home," said Jimmy as he pulled on the last of his clothes. "If you see that itsy-bitty little bitch, tell her if she wants her shit she'll find it out in front of my apartment by tomorrow morning." 

As he spoke Jimmy opened the door to leave. Molly was standing outside. She was in tears. 

"They left me!" she bawled. "They left without me..." 

"Wha?" asked Jimmy. 

"My family!" she sobbed. "I went back to our cabin and there was a note... from my dad. <sob> He said... He... said I'm a... a whore! He wants me to... <sob> ...to keep away from my sister <sob> so I don't turn her into a whore too!" 

Roy felt his skin crawl with guilt. 

"You want to come home with us honey?" asked Tuli. 

"So I can stand around and watch you screw some more? No fucking thanks!" 

"You can come home with me baby, it's OK," said Jimmy has he took her into his arms. She continued to sob into his massive shoulder. Roy looked at Tuli in surprise. Who would have thought that Jimmy could be tender? 

"What about Wanda?" asked Molly. 

"We're done. I was pretty fucking sick of her shit anyway." 

"Well... OK." Molly smiled. 

"Awesome." 

"So you headed back to the city?" asked Tony of Jimmy as he pulled his clothes back on. 

"Yeah sure. Let's get my stuff and we can get rollin'. Hey maybe we can all party at my place when we get back? Huh?" The guys nodded eagerly. Molly looked suddenly uneasy as she followed Jimmy and his buddies outside. 

"Christ," said Roy as he shook his head. "Poor kid." 

"She'll be fine," said Tuli as she struggled to pull herself up. "Every girl should have at least one huge-mistake relationship with a sexy asshole in her life. Besides, it sounds like she'll get stuffed by those guys tonight. Every woman should experience that too, lemmetellya." Tuli laughed. 

"I don't have to humiliate you every time we make love now, do I?" 

Tuli looked at him, suddenly hurt. "Is that what you were shooting for? Humiliation? I never really thought about it like that," she thought for a few seconds. She said brightly, "Oh well, I guess it worked! My God! I've never had such a good... Mmm, I can't even talk about it now." 

Roy was glad for that. 

drifted to the window as Tuli staggered to the bathroom and began fussing with the shower. Outside he saw Jimmy, Molly and the meatheads standing nervously as Wanda pointed a handgun at them. 

Roy bolted to the door and jumped outside. "Wanda! What the hell!?" 

"I'm sick of this motherfucker and I'm gonna shoot him." 

"Where'd you get the gun?" 

"Bought it," she said. "God bless America." 

"Don't rile her up man!" whimpered Jimmy. "She's nuts." 

"Hey, can I leave at least?" asked Molly as she cowered behind Jimmy's bulk. 

But from down the path came the manager. He had two guards on his flanks, tasers drawn. "That's it!" he sputtered. "I want you people out of here, now!" 

"Sounds good to me, lets go," said Molly hurriedly and started pulling Jimmy towards the parking lot. 

Roy walked up to Wanda. "Here, give me the gun before you get in trouble." 

"OK," she said handing him the gun. "It's not loaded and it only cost me a blowjob anyway. Hey, do you realize you're naked?" 

Jimmy and his entourage fled immediately as the manager and the two guards confronted Roy and Wanda. It took some fast talking from Roy to delay his and Wanda's arrest long enough for Tuli to come to their rescue. She was in a robe and was freshly showered but she exhibitted a weary-eyed hardness as she argued the manager into relenting. He agreed to not have them arrested if they all got out of the resort in twenty minutes. They agreed. 

"Where the hell am I gonna go?" Wanda was saying when Roy returned from throwing some shorts on. She looked lost, abandoned. 

"You want to stay with us for awhile?" asked Tuli 

Wanda smiled a big honest smile. "Yeah!" 

"Well, go get your stuff." 

"You bet!" she was grinning as she turned and ran back to collect her things. 

"Ummm... Where's she going to sleep?" asked Roy. 

"She's tiny. I think we can all fit on our mattress." 

"Oh, Tuli..." 

"You think it's a bad idea?" 

"Duh." 

"Yeah, well, I bet you'll like it well enough." 

"Of course. But..." 

"Oh, I imagine it won't last too long. I figure about five or six weeks or so before the arrangement blows up in our faces. It'll be messy, but it'll be fun. Well, except for you maybe." She leaned in, grabbed his crotch and spoke in a whisper: "We're going to keep you sooo busy." She kissed him. 

Roy stood, in a daze. The guards were staring at him in wonder, one of them flashed him a thumbs up. 

They got their stuff together and Roy lugged the suitcases to the car. They were still waiting for Wanda to bring out the last of her stuff -- she was a horrible over packer -- when Roy saw the wavy orange hair of Molly's mother approaching. 

"Excuse me," she said to Roy curtly. "Where is my daughter?" 

"You're... looking for her?" asked Roy. 

"What? Why wouldn't I be? What have you people done to her?" 

"She said her family disowned her and left!" said Roy. 

"God damn it. Why on Earth would she say that?" 

"She said her father left her a note disowning her..." 

"Dan? No he didn't. He's back at the lodge, drunk and weepy as an Irish Pope. He can barely speak right now, let alone write a note disowning our oldest child. All I know is that he said the couple in cabin F - you two apparently - have 'ruined' my eldest. So what the hell is going on" 

"I'm sorry," said Roy. "She left with that big guy in G. They split a few minutes ago." 

Molly's mother looked hard at him. "So Molly ran off with some older man? That figures. Where do you two come in?" 

Roy didn't know how to explain Molly's temptation to her mother; fortunately, Tuli jumped in, "We caught her spying on us through the window this morning. She... joined us. She was interested in a little experimentation." 

Molly's mom looked Tuli and Roy up and down, appraising them with an approving nod of her head. "Oh, OK... Good for her." 

"You're OK with that!?" asked Roy. 

"Well, I'm not that surprised. I figured she pull something like this eventually. In a way I'm glad she didn't do it during the semester and ruin her grades," 

"Knowing Jimmy, I imagine she's be plenty tired of him before the new school year starts," offered Tuli hopefully. 

"You two have kids?" asked Mrs. Markey. 

"Not yet," said Tuli. 

"Word of warning: girls are the worst. In my day I'd say about anything to get with a man I wanted. Hell, when I was that age I was throwing my legs open for any decent looking guy that came my way. I always figured Molly would get the hunger eventually. Poor Dan, after we first got married, I told him how promiscuous I used to be and he had such a hard time dealing with it; like he couldn't look at me without imagining me full of cocks. Now he has to go through the same ordeal over his daughter." She looked at Roy and laughed, "Sometimes I feel sorry for you men." 

Roy stared blankly. 

"I have a phone number for where Molly'll be saying," said Tuli. She took Jimmy's card from her purse. "Here's a pen to write that number down. I'd give you the card but it's our only copy." Roy looked hard at Tuli, but when the woman was finished she handed him the card and said, "Here, you hold onto that." 

"Why?" 

"He said he knows people. I bet we'd like to know people too." She winked. 

"Thanks," said the woman. "I'll give her a couple of days to wear herself out before I call. Here's mine," she handed them a business card that said she was called Katherine Markey and that she was a realtor. "If you ever want any real estate in North Jersey or if you just want some old mom to... you know, to play with." 

Tuli smiled and nodded. "Mrs. Markey!" she said in mock shock. "And you're a mother!" 

"Well, I used to be a slut once." 

Tuli laughed and nudged her as Wanda walked up with her last bag. "There's no such thing as an ex-slut, sweetie." All the women laughed. 

Roy bit the inside of his mouth. No. He was not dreaming.
