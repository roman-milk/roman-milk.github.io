Reading that one would give a bit of background to this one, but it is honestly not required to enjoy this story. For fans of my stories, they know what kinds of things to expect. This story deals with similar themes as the stories by wannabeboytoy, seducedHylas, and Dark Betrayal, namely cheating, betrayal, and heartbreak. If stuff like that isn't your cup of tea, then you probably shouldn't bother reading it. I do not condone any of these actions in real life. This is just a story. Enjoy.) 

October, 1692 

"My wife is not a witch!" Samuel Crow cried as the jailors drug hum away. Reverend Phillips followed him at a hurried pace. 

"I'm sorry, Sam, but the evidence is... I'm afraid... damning." the reverend replied. "We received word that there was witchcraft going on in your home. The city's patrol's investigated, and found three accused witches in your basement. And not only did we find the witches, we found suspicious paraphernalia as well." 

"Samuel, I had no idea about any accused witches in my home." Sam pleaded. 

"For what it's worth, I believe you. But as the owner of the home, I'm afraid the blame will fall on you." Phillips replied. 

The jailors tossed Samuel into a dirty jail cell and locked him inside. The reverend stuck by him as the jailors left. Sam got to his feet and grabbed the bars of the cell and spoke quickly to the reverend. 

"Listen, John." Samuel began, appealing to his friend. "This witchcraft business is nonsense! You know that right? There are no such things as witches or ghosts in the night." 

"Sam, I... I... it's just, bad things have been happening in town. Things I can't possibly explain. People doing things that I believed they'd never do. People committing sins in the eyes of the lord. People I trusted. I believe in the best in people, so the only explanation can be that there is evil afoot." 

"If you believe in the best in people, believe in me, believe in Madeline! We traveled to the colonies together! You knew my wife as a child. You know her. She is a woman of the church! She teaches the children. She is no witch. How could you of all people believe that?" Sam cried. The reverend looked pensive. 

"Then explain how three accused witches ended up in your home without you knowing. If you had no idea about this, then why would Madeline do this? Why would she house the accused?" John asked. 

"Because she knows, just like I do, that there are no witches. There is no witchcraft out there, and the only true evil is the distrust invading this city." Samuel stated, pleading for his friend to listen to reason. "My wife is a good person. She housed the accused because they are wrongfully accused! There is no such thing as witchcraft. This hunt is madness!" 

"I'm sorry, Samuel. God knows I believe you. I believe in you... and Madeline. I believe that you both believe what you say. But there are powers greater than mine that I cannot change. Once word has spread, there is not much I can do to change their minds. The accused women, the women found in your house, they have been accused of terrible things. Many of the men in town have admitted feeling something very... dark... about them. And, I hate to tell you, Samuel, I have heard similar rumors from men when they are around Madeline." the reverend admitted. 

"What?!" Samuel cried. 

"Yes, I have heard the whispers for some time. It is, of course, not my place to spread rumors." John stated. 

"These whispers are born out of jealously and envy. My wife is what others aspire to be. What men wish of their own wives. My wife is not one of those cursed women. She is no witch. I have loved her, I have lain with her. I have had children with her. I know more than anyone who she is. And she is not a witch, the devil's minion. She is good. She is pure! People are just spreading vicious rumors! That is the problem. People are afraid! They are scared and are seeing any little thing as witchcraft! Or demonry! You know my wife! You know she is a good, church-going woman! She would never even think about anything as ridiculous as witchcraft! Anything she did she did out of the goodness of her heart! She was protecting the wrongfully prosecuted, not encouraging witchcraft!" Samuel pleaded. 

"I know, Samuel. I trust Madeline, just like you do." John stated. "But, I don't know what I can do. Sam, this doesn't look good. I don't know if I can stop this." 

"Is there anything you can do?" Samuel begged. "Not about me, but about Madeline. Whatever happens to me is irrelevant. I will go to the gallows before I let anything happen to Madeline. All I care about is her. Is there anything that can be done to save her? To protect her?" 

"Well." John began. "There is something." 

"What? Anything!" Sam begged. 

"The church has some... abilities as well. Things not publicized, but things we have been forced to use more and more as this witchcraft, this devil's work, has increased. Unfortunately, the truth is, your wife will never be fully trusted again. That's just the way it is. Once an accusation has been made, you know as well as I do that it can never be the same again. We can't go back to how it used to be. But, we can use these... special abilities... to save Madeline. It will come at a cost. You will of course have to fully admit to the crime, admit to helping these witches, and absolve Madeline of responsibility. You will hang for this, unfortunately. And Madeline will pay a terrible price, but she will live." the reverend said cryptically. 

"The children?" Samuel asked, afraid. 

"They will be fine. I will see to it. Unfortunately, the devil's influence has found its way into your home. You and your wife will pay the consequences, but she will live." John assured. 

Sam stepped back, contemplating his suddenly approaching demise. 

"I'm sorry, Sam." John said to his old friend. Samuel looked fiercely at the reverend. 

"Just make sure you save her. Give me your word she will live. Save my wife, save my kids!" Sam demanded. 

"You have my word." John replied. Sam nodded. 

"Innocence must be protected." Sam stated. 

************ 

October 4, 2012 

"Samuel Crow was hung to death shortly after admitting guilt. Even though he was beloved in the town, and no one ever had a bad thing to say about him, he was still put to death! In exchange for admitting his guilt, Madeline Crow was spared. She was imprisoned in her home by the church. How they imprisoned her has been lost to time. Some said the church used their own brand of magic to imprison her. To bind her within her home. Others say they simply posted guards and posted fences to protect the townspeople from the darkness within. Her children were ripped from her, raised by others. She was practically tortured for the crime of protecting the innocent. Supposedly, her screams, her pleas of innocence were so constant that people couldn't stand to hear it. They say those cries drove people away from the town. And when these people put it together that this supposed witchcraft was nonsense, it was too late. The cries had stopped. When they finally opened the house and granted her freedom, the House of Crow was empty. The church claimed there was no way for her to escape, so even though they never found her body, she was marked as dead. Madeline Crow, an innocent woman, was dead, as was her husband, for no crime whatsoever. And those responsible for spreading this idea of witchcraft were never held responsible. The reverend John Phillips was the one claimed as being responsible for spreading the paranoia, but he was supposedly promoted within the church. But he eventually left the church mysteriously and was never heard from again." 

"Well, thanks for the summary, narrator." Nadine said from the passenger seat to her best friend, who just finished her speech. 

"I'm sorry." Sally replied, "It's just a tragedy what happened to her, and now, how she's built up and treated as guilty, treated as if she was actually a witch, that's just rubbing salt on the wound. You know? It's just twisting the knife." 

"Alright, hun, jeez! " Nadine began, "Sorry to insult your girlfriend you fucking dyke!" she replied quickly, before realizing it wasn't just her and Sally in the car, so she got quiet, blushed a bit, and mumbled an apology. 

Sally Samson was driving her parent's minivan as she drove her group of friends towards their goal. She looked at the rearview mirror at her gaggle of friends and smiled. It was definitely an eclectic group. They had some things in common. All of them were classmates, all in their senior year of high school, and all 18. But they had little in common other than that. 

Her eyes first fell onto her boyfriend, Alex. She always felt a little warmer when looking at him. A lot of people had told her that her and him were meant to be together. They were seemingly just set aside for each other. They were the top two students in the class, and it often felt like they were the only two that understood the ways of the world. They both felt set apart from everyone else, as if they were working on a different level. They both had been called old souls. So it was almost by default that they ended up liking each other. It felt like fate was pushing them together. 

As soon as they started dating, it just felt right. To both, it felt like they had met the person they were gonna spend the rest of their lives together. They could literally talk for hours about anything. Politics. History. Television. They had the same tastes in movies, in TV shows. They even had the sense of humor. The only subject she ever couldn't give lip service to him about was sports, but his buddies could talk football with him. And if there was ever any lull in their conversation, Sally would provide another type of lip service. 

Alex was the first and only guy she had ever gotten physical with. She couldn't resist him, but it wasn't like he was forcing the issue. It was just... he was so hot! Sally couldn't control herself around him. He drove her crazy whenever they were around each other. On top of being the smartest guy into school, he was also widely considered the school hunk. 

He played running back for the high school football team. Even though football was a foreign language to her, she loved watching Alex on the field. She loved watching him move so confidently on the field, bowling over the opposition. She loved watching the way his muscles flexed and shined with sweat as the game went on. She loved watching the way his tight football pants clung to his cute butt. She loved watching him drive his way on, using his manly strength to push forward, his hips and legs thrusting, his tight butt flexing... it always got Sally hot under the collar. 

Despite being a football player, he wasn't a typical jock. He was very soft- spoken, but when he did speak, it carried a lot of weight. Alex was one of those guys that just kinda commanded respect. He wasn't the super popular guy, but if you asked anyone, they would say they liked him. He never sought popularity, but it kinda came to him anyway. 

Part of that was due to his looks. He was tall and fit, but he was lean and not overly muscular. He had striking eyes, a boyish face, prominent jawbones, and shaggy, brown, unkempt in just the right way hair. He had the cutest, sly smile, and his dimples were enough to make any girl melt. But no girl could crack his code. He was an old soul, so he would not easily be lured in typical high school girl tricks. No, Sally was his first and only girlfriend, as far as she knew, and knowing that filled her with pride. 

In the far back seats were Tony and Timmy. Tony was a big guy. He was on the football team, and you could have figured that out just by looking at him. He was well over six feet tall and built like an ox. Just tall and thick and bulging with muscles. You would look at him and think he was a typical jock. But shockingly, he and Sally were longtime friends, since childhood. They had been neighbors most of their lives, and while him and Sally had little in common, they were still friends. He was like Sally's unofficial big brother. He was always around to protect her and have her back. He was not the brightest guy, and he would go as far as his body would take him career wise. But, he was a great, loyal friend, and he would be a friend to Sally for life. 

Timmy was sitting next to him. He was one of the few black students to go to their school. Sally and him had ben lab partners in chemistry their sophomore year, and it was there they became friends. And they remained friendly, but admittedly, he was closer with Tony and Alex than he was with Sally, since they were all on the football team. He was a wide receiver. He was about six foot, lean and muscular. He was a handsome guy, and he had no shortage of romantic success. 

In the middle seat, next to Alex, was Dom, Alex's best friend. They were an odd pair, as while Alex was quiet and laid back, Dom was outgoing and the life of the party. Dom was just fun to be around, and was as quick-witted as they came. And not only that, he was exceedingly worldly. His parents were rich, so he had traveled all over the world. He also was always the first guy to discover new bands, and in general, he was ahead of the curve on all things cool. He was one of the most popular guys in school. 

Sally glanced at Nadine next to her. Nadine was her absolute best friend in the world. They had known each other since pre-school, and had stayed friends all through school up to now, their senior year of high school. Nadine was a fiery Latina. She was always very loud and opinionated, and definitely not someone you wanted to get on your bad side. This was all in contrast to Sally, who was always very studious, quiet and humble. They were very much opposites, but they had always been best friends and that had never wavered once. Nadine had a tough exterior, but underneath her loud mouth and confrontational personality, she was fiercely loyal and a great friend. 

She was always that friend that grew up a bit faster than the others. She was the first girl to ditch the dolls and start becoming interested in boys. She was the first friend who started dating. So, even though Sally was more of book-smart girl, her best friend was always more street smart, to put it simply. Nadine had always been there to guide her less worldly best friend without worry of embarrassment. 

Although she could be a bit intimidating and tightly wound, Nadine was smoking hot. She was definitely curvy. She wasn't skinny as a rail like some of her female peers, but she was still quite fit and an athlete. The extra few pounds she did carry went to all the right places, making her curvy body extra juicy and sexy. She had a very large set of breasts, a pair of perky, firm DD's, and her consistently tight wardrobe always highlighted them. She had a round, shelf-like ass, heart-shaped and ripe like an unpicked fruit. Her skin was caramel colored, silky and smooth all over. She was a bit short, but her attitude more than made up for that shortcoming. And her face was very pretty. She wasn't the type to be too girly and wear tons of make-up, and the truth was, she didn't need it. She was naturally very pretty. Her chestnut eyes, long eyelashes, and thin eyebrows were striking, drawing any man's attention. Her curly brunette hair was typically in a pony-tail, feminine but not girly. Her lips were very plump even though her natural expression came across as a bit of a sneer, the look worked for her. 

Nadine had a major crush on Dom. She had had feelings for him for a while now. She was not very subtle, so she had done all she could to make it clear she liked him. He probably knew that, but he never pursued it. She was not his type. He was interested more in the cute, dressed down, hipster chick kinda girl. Nadine was more up front and brash than he was used to. Dom was always polite to Nadine, but he never returned her feelings. Plus, he had started seeing another girl at school. But that never stopped Nadine. She was too stubborn to give up. She kept pursuing him, even though he might be a lost cause. 

Whenever she was around Dom, she tried to cool her jets and be on her best behavior. She had a brash, kinda mean sense of humor, and she always thought it might a bit much for him. So, she tried to tone it down, but it was hard for her. 

While she was not much in the ways of school work, she always had an opinion, and she was accustomed to getting her way. In classes she would often get into loud disagreements. The only person who could keep her calm was Sally. 

Sally and Nadine where always looked at as an odd pair. While Nadine was not much of a student, Sally was literally the top student in the class, and she was always responsible and respectful. She had already locked up a full-ride scholarship, but she was not the type to sit back and relax. She was always driven for certain causes, and she always strived to give everything her best. And even though she was the perfect student, she definitely could get a fire under her for certain causes, and when she got worked up, very few could hold her back. She was very stubborn and headstrong. Nadine and her were more common than you would think. 

Sally was always an overachiever, and it didn't hurt matters that she was also classically beautiful. She was a stunning blonde, with crystal blue eyes, perfectly formed cheekbones, thin, sinewy lips, and a nice, tan complexion. Her smile could light a room, and it often did. And her body was nothing to sneeze at. She was fit and thin, thanks to years of running track. She was fairly tall, and her legs were nice and firm. Her belly was relatively flat, and she had a nice pair of B-cups. She was the type of girl who made other parents jealous that she wasn't their daughter. She was everything you could ever want in a daughter. And plus, she was always responsible, always professional, and always courteous. She was quite nearly perfect. 

The only time she ever got mad or worked up for were her causes, as her friends would refer to them. Every so often, she would dive in on different causes, and she would dive in hard. The economy, the poor, the genocides in Africa, and alternative energy were all among the causes Sally was involved with. And now, her new cause was to clear Madeline Crow's name. 

The story of Madeline Crow had become something of a local legend. As time moved on, what began as a tragedy became something of a ghost story. Over time, flourishes and embellishments had been added to Madeline's story. Suddenly, in these stories, she had been caught in the act, caught cursing people in town. She was apparently practicing dark magic and the occult, and they found her secret room full of occult imagery. None of this was true, of course. The actual story was far more tragic. There was never any proof of anything connecting Madeline to dark magic. But society had already made its mind up. In the eye of the world, Madeline was guilty. 

Madeline Crow was now synonymous with witchcraft. People told ghost stories claiming to have seen her. Kids played tag, and the tagged person was told that they were "Maddy Crow." Kids thought that if you said her name three times, she would appear and curse them. Every time some aspiring teenage filmmaker made a movie in town, it would be a poorly made ghost story involving Madeline Crow. There was the Week of Crow, a festival the week before Halloween with the theme of witchcraft, with Madeline as sort of a mascot. There was even a local metal band whose imagery was themed around Madeline Crow. They even had their van painted up, showing both a witch version of Madeline and a devilish version of her, both images sexed up to draw people in, both images based on the one existing image of Madeline. And during their concerts, they had imagery of her hung up that was practically pornographic.  

===

This image was a painting of Madeline. It was almost like a family portrait. It had Madeline standing with her husband and her two children. Most of the time, the women in these types of paintings seemed very dour and plain, but Madeline was not. She was strikingly beautiful, especially compared to the paintings of other women from around that time. Some people theorized that her uncommon, mature beauty was part of the reason she was accused of being a witch. No woman could be that beautiful in that day and time. She no doubt inspired jealousy in others, no doubt causing them to make baseless accusations. 

Copies of this painting were hung up around town, in various buildings, schools, the town hall, the mayor's office, and even local bars. For some, this picture was a haunting reminder of the town's dark past, and a reminder to not let a mob mentality rule. But some took these reminders as some sort of proof of how witchcraft had permeated throughout the town. A lot of people were freaked out by these paintings. They got a vibe from them. A lot of people walked by them and felt as if they were being watched. 

And people of course thought that Madeline's still standing house was haunted. People through the years had tried to sneak into the Crow house, to the point where the city was forced to have a cop present around the house to prevent any reckless youths from breaking in. But apparently, some people had broken in and claimed the house was haunted by Madeline's vengeful spirit. 

All of this was hogwash, obviously. People had gotten so interested in the fantastical that they had kind of lost the plot. It was a much more interesting, sexier story if Madeline Crow was actually a witch. There was a lot more meat to that story. But the truth was that what happened was simply a tragedy. Madeline Crow was wrongly persecuted and subjected to a punishment she did not deserve. 

No fate sounded worse to Sally. 

So Sally took it upon herself to vindicate her. None of the people who had broken into the house were ever there for education reasons. Some historians had tried to get permission from the city a few years ago, but the rumor was that the church had intervened and forced the city's hand in not allowing anyone to enter the house. This pissed Sally off. She was already interested in Madeline's story, but this pushed her over the edge and inspired her new mission. To prove Madeline innocent and show the entire town that she was someone whose fate should not be taken so lightly. She was someone to be honored and respected. 

"So Sal..." Tony began from the back seat, "What's your plan exactly?" 

"Okay," Sally started. "I spied out the house a few days ago. I know usually around this time, they have a cop car near the house, so we'll have to be careful. But, I noticed that they don't usually end up there until around seven or so, so we have time to get there before the cops would notice. Now, there is a fence there, and it is chained shut, but I did kinda borrow my Dad's bolt cutters." 

"Jeez, Sal, this is going to be full on breaking and entering." Dom said. 

"Are you sure this is a good idea, Sally?" Alex asked responsibly. 

"Guys, people have gotten caught there before. They just get sent away with a warning. If they catch us, we can just act like a bunch of rambunctious teens and they won't think twice." Sally replied. 

"We are a bunch of rambunctious teens... right?" Dom asked. 

"I mean, yeah, this will be fun and kind of a thrill, but this is a mission with a purpose. I want to find something to validate Madeline Crow's innocence. I've asked town historians, city hall, even the church if they have fully investigated this place..." she began. 

"Whoa, you went to the church and didn't tell me?" Timmy asked. 

"Yeah. So?" Sally asked, confused. 

"You should have told me. I would have come with you. I love those nuns there." Timmy joked, holding his hands in front of his chest as if holding a pair of melons. 

"Ewww, Timmy. Don't be gross." Sally said. "Anyway, everyone I asked all kinda dodged answering me. So, if no one wants to give me answers, I'll just get them myself." Sally said. Alex smiled. He loved her drive to do what was right. Sally saw him smile, and blushed in response. 

Sally was happy. Surrounded by her loving boyfriend and her loyal friends, all working together to allow her to do this research. Warmth filled her heart. 

This couldn't be going any better. 

************* 

Sally placed the car into park and switched off the ignition. They had done it. They had arrived. 

They had reached the Cursed House of Crow. 

All of her friends piled out of the car and into the cool autumn air. They all took a moment to take in the fabled house in front of them. It was definitely impressively large. And despite how ridiculous Sally found these ghost stories about Madeline, even she had to admit the house was definitely foreboding and a bit spooky. If you imagined a spooky, haunted house, you would imagine the Crow house. 

It must have been well designed to be still so well intact after all these years. It was two stories with a raised point in the middle. It was built out of dark wood with black formed steel around the windows and the roof. Nothing could be seen through the dark windows. Even Sally felt a chill go through her while looking at the Crow estate. Sally wrote that off as being from the sharp, biting October wind. 

"Even though I don't believe the ghost stories..." Alex started, "I will admit this place is actually pretty creepy." This caused the others to laugh nervously, because they were all feeling the same thing. Even though they all knew better, none of them were exactly excited to go inside. This house could be a haunted house in a movie and it wouldn't feel out of place. 

"Do you think this house has wi-fi?" Dom asked, phone in hand, causing the others to laugh, breaking the tension. Nadine laughed a little harder than the rest, causing Dom to smile uncomfortably. She was a cool girl, Dom thought, but it was obvious she liked him, and she wasn't exactly subtle about it. He would put up with her in social gatherings, but he didn't particularly care for her obvious come-ons and unsubtle flirting. He liked girls with a bit more substance. He had never once had a conversation with her that stimulated him in the least. He couldn't imagine ever dating her. Sure, she was good looking, but he was positive the conversations would dry up quickly. He couldn't imagine anything that they had in common, any common interests that could make a relationship with such a shallow, self-centered girl worth it. 

He glanced at Nadine and played with his phone. He put it to his ear as the others chatted a bit. 

"Hey, Rach, it's me." Dom said to his girlfriend. The others chatted, but Nadine stared bullets at him. "Yeah, I'm just hanging with some friends. I might get a bit delayed, but I should only be a few hours... yeah, definitely, I'll be there. Okay, talk you soon. Bye." 

Dom hung up and rejoined the group. He glanced at Nadine, and she looked at him angrily. 

"That was mean." Alex whispered as Dom stepped up next to him. Dom just sorta shrugged his shoulders. Alex rolled his eyes and spoke up. 

"So, what's the plan?" Alex said as the group walked slowly towards the house. 

"Well, uh, we go in and look around. Try to find something, some record of what happened. Maybe like a journal or document. Anything to find out what she was thinking after her incarceration. It shouldn't take too long. Only a couple hours." Sally said. 

"So, here's a question." Alex began. "How are we getting in?" he finished, staring at the door as they walked up the front steps and reached the front stoop. The other's looked at the door and realized it was padlocked shut. 

"Um, you think those bolt cutters will get the job done?" Tony asked. 

"Worth a shot." Sally replied. Tony lumbered back to the car to retrieve the bolt cutters. He returned to the front stoop of house. He put them in place and used his strength to once again use the cutters for nefarious purposes, sending the padlock to the ground as he snipped the lock. He set down the tool and waited. Sally smiled at him and reached to the door handle. She twisted it and pushed at it, but she walked into the door slightly as the door didn't budge. She tried again, shaking at the door, but it wasn't moving. 

"Is it locked or something?" Nadine asked. 

"If it's locked, what are we gonna do? Break in?" Alex asked. 

"I don't want to, like, destroy the place. I just want to get in." Sally replied. 

"Timmy..." Dom started. "You're black. You should know the best way to break into a house." 

"Fuck you." Timmy replied with a laugh. Being one of the only black students at his high school gave him a good sense of humor about his race. 

"You know, I don't see a lock." Sally said, bending over. 

"Step back." Tony said. Moving forward, he grabbed the door handle as the others stepped back. He reared back and slammed his shoulder into the door violently. The door budged a bit as Tony flexed his shoulder. 

"That must have hurt." Sally said. Tony grimaced a bit, but before anyone could react, he grabbed the handle, reared back, and slammed his shoulder into the door again. The door flew open with a crack and Tony slightly fell into the doorway. 

The House of Crow was now open. 

Tony nursed his sore shoulder as he stepped aside to allow an unafraid Sally to enter. Even though the others were a bit more nervous than they let on, they slowly followed behind her. 

The first thing they all noticed was the smell. The stale, musty air within smelled like wet, rotted wood and dust. All of them covered their noses as they adjusted to the scent. 

"Don't worry guys. You'll get used to it." Sally said. 

"I hope I never get used to this." Nadine replied. 

Sally reached into her bag and grabbed some flashlights. She passed them out among her friends. 

"Okay guys, be careful." Sally began, "Watch your step. There might be like, rats, or something." 

"Rats?" Nadine replied nervously, trying to act unafraid in front of Dom. 

"Don't worry, Nadine. We won't be here too long, hopefully." Sally replied. 

SLAM! 

All of them jumped as the door slammed shut. 

"Sorry guys." Tony said. "I don't know my strength sometimes." 

The room was dark now that the door was shut. They all lit up their flashlights and looked around, studying their surroundings for the first time. 

The house looked unlived in, obviously. Weeds and mushrooms were growing through the floorboards. Dust covered everything. The room itself was rather plain. They were in a large living area. The room had a few small tables and chairs. The walls were only lightly decorated. Everything was made out of darkened wood. There were shelves with plates along the walls. The main feature in the room was a large fireplace, made of rock. And above it, hanging on the stone, was the famous painting of Madeline Crow. 

Looking up at it, the painting of Madeline standing behind her family, adorned with her pilgrim-like clothing and a Mona Lisa smile, it captured each one of their visions. It was one of those paintings that when you looked at it made you feel as if the eyes were watching you. All of them looked away, eager to look away from the creepy painting. 

"So, uh, what's the plan?" Alex asked. 

"Well, we either go around as a group, go through each room one by one, or we split up and tackle everything quicker." Sally suggested. 

"Split up? That never ends well." Timmy replied. 

"Timmy, this isn't a horror movie." Sally stated. 

"Good, cause if this becomes one, we all know who goes out first." Timmy said, causing them all to laugh nervously. 

"Let's split up." Alex said firmly. "Three groups of two. I don't believe the horror stories, but I don't want to stick around too long." 

"Sounds good." Dom said. 

"I'll go with Dom." Nadine jumped in, excited to take advantage of the situation. 

"Uhhhhhhh... ohhhh-kay. I guess." Dom said slowly, unable to find a reason to say no. Nadine noticed his hesitation and winced a bit. 

"I'm guessing you two aren't splitting anytime soon?" Timmy asked Alex and Sally. 

"Uh, we'll probably stick together, yeah." Alex replied. 

"That's fine. Cause when all the ghosts appear, you're gonna want to be with us." Timmy replied, standing next to Tony. 

"Okay, Tony and Timmy, you guys take the first floor, me and Alex and Dom and Nadine will split the upstairs." Sally planned out quickly. 

"Okay, let's get going." Alex stated. Everyone nodded in assent. "Dom, let me talk to you a sec." 

"Don't keep me waiting." Nadine purred to Dom. Dom rolled his eyes and stepped aside with his best friend. 

"Hey," Alex began. "I know you're not into Nadine, but she's a good person, so try not to, like, hurt her feelings." 

"Alex, she is such, a..." Dom began, not knowing how to describe. 

"Listen, I know she's a bit much. But please be... polite." Alex said. Dom rolled his eyes. 

"Fine." Dom conceded, stifling his inner smart-ass in effort to appease his friend. 

"Good." Alex said, patting Dom on the shoulder and heading back over to Sally, Dom close behind. Once they reached the group, Sally spoke up. 

"Okay, guys, let's get to it." she said perkily. And just as she finished that sentence, a long, whining creak came from the floor above them. Once the creak ended, Sally looked around and noticed the apprehension in their eyes. 

"Oh, c'mon, it was just the wind." Sally said fearlessly. They all kinda laughed off the noise, but all of them were still a bit nervous. Unafraid, Sally marched up the stairs. Shrugging, Alex followed behind her, Dom and Nadine close behind. 

As they reached the second floor, Sally used the flashlight to light their way through the dark hallway. She swept away the cobwebs and led the way towards the first door. Approaching it, she grabbed the handle and pushed it. It was stuck, like the front door had been. She shook at it a bit, but before she could do any more, Alex stepped in front of her and used his shoulder to force the door open. 

Sally shined the flashlight inside the room, eager to appraise its contents. Her light shone on walls of heavy bookshelves, each loaded to the brim with books. 

"Ha Ha!" Sally laughed out. "Okay... I think we just found the motherload." 

Sally stepped inside, admiring the room filled with books and texts. There was a thick table and a sitting desk, with an inkwell and a feather. 

"Okay, I think I will spend, like, all of my time here." Sally said excitedly. She walked towards one of the bookshelves and ran her fingers over the heavy books. "This is awesome." she whispered to herself. 

"Okay, Dom, Nadine, you guys take the rest of the floor. I think Sal is gonna hunker down here for awhile." Alex suggested. Dom nodded and Nadine smiled at this. They walked away, leaving the two lovebirds alone. 

Alex looked over at his girlfriend, who already had her nose buried in a book. Alex was admittedly not as obsessed with this adventure as Sally was, but he was always up for anything. Even though the house was pretty creepy, Alex didn't think this house could have anything inside that could truly surprise him. Alex was very even-keeled, and it took a lot to make him truly uncomfortable. It would take a lot more than a creepy old house to freak him out. 

He kept his eyes on Sally and admired her for a few moments. A lot of people would kinda be overwhelmed by the fervor Sally got into when she was on the case in one of her missions. But Alex, well, he kinda liked it. He liked seeing her so worked up... so passionate. It kinda turned him on. 

Even though Alex and Sally were both kinda straight arrows, they actually had a pretty active sex life. Both of them had healthy sexual appetites and they enjoyed indulging those appetites with each other. People looked at them as being the type of couple who spent their time studying or talking about intellectual things, but they knew how to get down. Some of Alex's friends were surprised to hear that Sally was willing to put out, but she definitely did. Alex and Sally were definitely very active and very attracted to each other, and sometimes, Alex had trouble maintaining his cool demeanor around her. 

And when she got like this, almost in a fanatic fervor over new knowledge, he liked it. He couldn't explain it. Maybe it had to do with the fact that whenever she got like this, it always made her extra playful and passionate in the bedroom. But Sally just did something to Alex. He was always cool and in control, however there was something about Sally that just drove him nuts. 

She was everything he ever wanted in a girl. She was pretty. She was fit and thin but she still had good curves in the right places. A nice pair of B-cups and a cute, petite butt. Even though he was not the type of guy to be so shallow, he did still have his preferences, and luckily Sally met them. And fortunately, she was a blonde. Alex always had a soft spot for blondes. Blondes always seemed so bright and perky and full of life. 

Alex watched as she bent over to grab a book, pointing her cute, jean clad butt at him. And, despite his spooky surroundings, Alex realized that Sally's passion and body had left him painfully erect. So he couldn't stop himself from approaching his girlfriend's bent over form and pressing his crotch against her jean clad butt, putting his hands on her hips. 

"What are you doing?" Sally purred, feeling her boyfriend's sizable meat pressed between her butt cheeks. Alex had many qualities that attracted her to him. His great body. His scruffy, wild hair. His piercing eyes. His cute smile. His soft spoken personality. His fierce intelligence. Any of those things could get him a girlfriend, and that was what attracted Sally to him. So, later finding out that this seemingly perfect guy also happened to have a wrist- thick, nine inch dick was just icing on the cake. 

"I love you, hon." Alex whispered. 

"Well, I love you too, babe. But what are you doing?" she asked with a laugh. 

"I like seeing you so worked up." Alex whispered as Sally straightened up and pressed herself against him. 

"You seem to always be worked up." Sally countered with a sly smile. Despite his cool appearance, Sally's boyfriend always seemed to be ready for some action. Sally was shocked by how ready he was to get down all the time, and how surprisingly intimate and affectionate he was ready to be at all times, even in public. Sally didn't anticipate this wild side to him, but instead of turning herself away from him, it really turned her on and made her feel good. She loved how attracted he was to her, and plus, she loved seeing a bit of his darker, naughtier side. 

"I think I have good reason to be worked up." Alex whispered, kissing her neck. 

"Hey, this isn't the time." Sally said, reluctantly pulling away from his soft lips. 

"What, you don't know about my haunted house fetish?" Alex joked. 

"Oh, yeah, this place is so hot." Sally laughed out. She finally pulled away and turned to face him. Stepping close to him, she gave him a soft kiss and firmly grabbed his jean-clad shaft in her palm. 

"Save it for later, babe." Sally said, squeezing his dick softly, causing him to groan, "Don't worry, for helping me out, for bringing me here, I've got something extra special ready for you tonight." 

"Mmm, I can't wait." Alex purred, kissing his girlfriend. 

"Well..." she began, kissing him back, "You'll have to." she finished, stepping back, all business again as she went back to searching the books, leaving him high and dry. He had no expectations that she would want to get it on in the haunted house, but it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, that left his dick uncomfortably swollen in his pants. 

He didn't need to worry about it, though. He wouldn't have to wait that long. By the time he would leave this house, his balls would be completely drained. He just didn't know it yet.  

===

And he also didn't know that he wasn't the only person in this house who had sex on their mind. 

Nadine trailed behind Dom, watching his hot body as they walked, barely able to stop herself from jumping his bones and forcing herself on him. He was just so hot to her. He had the deep, brooding attitude that could drive any girl nuts, and the sense of humor to make anyone like him. He had close cropped brown hair and a bit of stubble that made him look rough and mature. He had deep, dark eyes that pulled you in. And his body was fit and sexy. And his demeanor made him even more sexy. He was surprisingly quiet for such a joker, but when he spoke out and made a joke it made his jokes even funnier. His words carried weight, and his ability to not have to force his humor on people made him even more appealing. 

Nadine wanted him bad. She racked her head over what to do to make it clear she was his for the taking. She had flirted and preened around him, but he had never made a move. He always came across like he was above the social games of high school stuff, and even though he had his choice of girls, he never seemed to date any of the girls in school. That was until recently, until he started palling around with that skinny bitch Rachel, who dressed in that stupid, ironic, hipster clothing. She didn't dress the part of a girly girl like Nadine did. Nadine dressed like a woman. Rachel dressed like a member of a lesbian indie band! But somehow Dom preferred her. Somehow, she landed the hottest single guy in school! Nadine was baffled by this. Didn't Dom know he could have her instead! And he could definitely have her in any way he wanted. 

"So, this is fun." Nadine said, following Dom, eyes on his cute butt. 

"Uh yeah, it's alright." he replied, never turning to face her as he kept walking. They came to a door and Dom pushed it open. He walked inside cautiously, with Nadine right behind. They emerged into a bedroom, with a large bed and a light shining through the dirty window. 

Both of them stepped into the room and Dom shone the flashlight through the room. There were a few pieces of furniture, like shelves and desks and a few other odds and ends. The bed looked simple, a wood frame and a thin padding that acted like a mattress. 

"That bed looks mighty comfy." Nadine suggested, walking towards it. 

"No it doesn't." Dom replied, not giving her an inch in her obvious come-ons and double-entendres. 

"It looks big enough for two." Nadine replied, moving in front of him, raising her eyebrows coyly. 

"Of course it does. It was for Madeline and her husband." Dom replied. 

"Oh, come-on, Dom. Loosen up." she said, stepping up to him, rubbing his shoulder. He backed away quickly. 

"Let's keep looking." Dom said, turning away from her. Nadine scrunched her eyebrows in annoyance. 

Dom thumbed through the furniture, looking for anything interesting. Nadine racked her brain for anything she could say to Dom. She looked around listlessly and glanced at the window. And when she did... 

"AHH!" Nadine squealed, jumping back, backing into Dom. 

"What is it?" Dom asked, looking around, unconsciously having grabbed her as she nearly fell back into him. 

"I saw... I saw a face! In the window!" Nadine said, legitimately upset. 

"What?" Dom asked skeptically. 

She wasn't kidding. When she glanced into the window, she saw the reflection of a face, as if someone was behind her. It wasn't Dom's face. It was a woman's face. An older woman, a woman who looked shockingly similar to... 

"It was Madeline! Madeline Crow! I swear!" Nadine cried out. She was breathing deep, clearly scared. 

"What do you mean? You saw her in the window?" Dom asked. 

"She... she... I saw her in the window. Her face. Reflected. It was like she was behind me. When I looked behind me she wasn't. It was only... you." Nadine said, looking up at him. It was only then she realized she was in Dom's strong arms. Dom's firm hands were on her body, around her waist. A shiver ran through her. Her nipples turned hard and her pussy moistened. Before she could think twice, she bent her knees, lowering herself until his hands slid up her sides until they were against the sides of her breasts. 

"Okay!" Dom said, leaping away from her. "You know, Nadine, I've tried to be nice. But, seriously, I should have fucking known." 

"I'm sorry, Dom, but I seriously did see something." Nadine cried out. 

"Bullshit, Nadine. Alright, I will make this very clear. I don't like you. I have a girlfriend. And I like her a lot. Face the facts that me and you will never happen!" Dom said firmly. 

"Dom, I..." Nadine began. 

"Stop! Just stop!" Dom cut her off. "I don't want to hear it! I am tired of your shameless flirting and your pathetic come-ons." 

"You can cum on me anytime." Nadine said quietly. 

"Nadine!" Dom said. 

"Sorry." she said quietly, tearing up. 

"Nadine..." Dom began, his tone softening. "I don't want to make you cry. But, it's just you come on so strong. You are so blatant to the point of being rude. You disrespect me and Rachel by hitting on me. I can't go along with that. That just doesn't work for me. I think you've just got to grow up a bit and face facts. You can't always get what you want." 

Nadine looked away, not wanting to make eye contact with him as he dressed her down. And not in the way she wanted him to dress her down. 

"Listen, Nadine, in the end, when it all comes down to it, you're just not my type. You'll make someone really happy, but it's not me. I know you like me, but it's just not gonna happen." 

"You're wrong." Nadine said quietly. 

"I'm not." Dom said. "I don't want to make this awkward, but I hope we can at least be civil." 

"I'm not wrong." Nadine said, a tear falling down her cheek as she turned and stomped out of the room down the hall. 

Dom sighed and rolled his eyes. He felt bad about making her cry, but she had made him so uncomfortable. She needed a taste of her own medicine. She needed the rough truth. 

Nadine needed a rough something else as well. 

Even though Dom had shut her down, even though her crush was farther from happening than ever before, she didn't know the truth. She didn't see the future. She didn't know how this day would end. She didn't know how happy she would be at the end of the night. 

The occupant of this house had big plans for Nadine. 

*********** 

"This is dumb." Timmy said. He and Tony were checking out the first floor, and they had progressed to the kitchen. 

"Yeah, but, I owe it to Sal." Tony said. 

"Owe it to her? Only one thing a girl could give me that would want to make me want to come here." Timmy said. Tony looked at him dully. "Sex. I'm talking about sex." Timmy explained. He wasn't the sharpest guy around. 

"Dude, shut up." Tony replied. 

"You like her or something?" Timmy asked. 

"No. It's not like that. She's like a sister." Tony said. 

"Yikes. I'm surprised you'd want to do those things to your sister." Timmy said. 

"Yo, shut the fuck up." Tony called out, stepping up towards him. Timmy backed away from the larger Tony, hands up. 

"Just messing with you man, just messing with you." Timmy said. 

"Whatever man." Tony muttered. "Why you even here?" 

"Well, unlike you, it's not cause I want to bang Sally." Timmy joked. Tony tensed up and began breathing deep like a bull. "Just playing man. Listen, me and Sal were lab partners, so we worked a bit together. She's a cool girl. I don't blame you for liking her." 

"Say one more thing and I'll fucking beat the shit out of you." Tony threatened the smart-ass in front of him. 

"I don't like her, but I do want to be friends with her. I want her to be able to invite me over to her house like we did when we were lab partners." Timmy said. 

"What? Why?" Tony asked. 

"Her mom is the hottest piece of ass I've ever seen." Timmy said with a sly smile. 

"What? You want to bang Sally's mom? That's fucked up!" Tony replied. 

"Sure is. But it would be fucking worth it. Have you seen her tits? That ass? She's gagging for it." Timmy said. 

"Dude, I can't fucking deal with you." Tony said, turning away as Timmy smiled and went back to looking. 

Tony wasn't the brightest guy. He'd been nicknamed the Ox by his teammates. He was big and strong but no one had any respect for him intellectually. Sure, he didn't get the best grades, but he didn't feel dumb. That was until he was around people like Sally, and Alex, smart people, which made him feel like he was missing out on things, a whole other world. He just knew things in his spectrum, like football, and gym stuff. But his peers could talk about politics and issues and not sound out of place. It was only then that Tony felt like an idiot. Despite his size, it was those moments that he felt like the smallest guy in the world. He just wanted someone to respect him. Respect what he could do. 

He thought he had that in Sally. She treated him different. Like a friend. Tony thought it could be something more, that is until she started dating Alex. Alex was a cool dude, but Tony couldn't help but resent him a little bit for being with the girl he liked. Tony soon realized she would never see him that way and he had no choice but to dive in to his other pursuits. Like football. Or weightlifting. 

So there Tony was, the biggest guy in school, respected by no one. Despite his large size, he didn't garner that respect from his peers. He was not a leader, he was a follower. A coach's dream, cause he was the type to be told to do something and be able to do it. He didn't like to think of himself as dumb, but deep down he was afraid he was just a big, dumb ox. No girl would want a dumb ox like him. He just wanted to find someone who appreciated his set of skills. But he hadn't found that. Not yet. 

"Dude, there ain't nothing here." Timmy called out, examining the stove. 

"Just keep looking." Tony replied, shining his flashlight at the wall. 

Timmy rolled his eyes and sauntered away. He looked away and noticed a door. It must have been a pantry or something. He walked over to it and popped open the door. He stepped inside and looked around. The room was windowless, so the only light came from his flashlight and the ambient light from the open door behind him. His flashlight shined through the cobwebs, examining the room. This pantry had no food in it. Any food that was once there was now gone, obviously. There were some shelves, but they were mostly empty. His flashlight did shine on a pair of large, white milk jugs, sitting on a shelf, but there wasn't much else. There were a few blankets and tattered cloth, but for the most part, this small room was mostly empty. Timmy was about to turn back and leave this room when... 

SLAM! 

The door behind him slammed shut, leaving the room mostly dark, other than the light coming from his flashlight. Timmy jumped at the sound of this and spun around and shone his light at the door. It was then he realized he wasn't alone. 

"AAHHH! HOLY FUCK!" Timmy screamed out. 

Some knocks came in from the now closed door. 

"Timmy, you alright." Tony's muffled voice came from beyond the door. 

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! 

Tony knocked again, beating at the door with the back of his fist. 

"You alright?" Tony called out. 

Timmy couldn't reply. He was in shock. Cause standing in front of him was another person. A person who shouldn't be here. But it was no witch. 

"Mrs. Samson? What are you doing here?" Timmy asked. 

Standing in front of Timmy was Sally's mom, Mrs. Jane Samson. A bodacious blonde if there ever was one. Jane stood in front of Timmy wearing a pair of skin tight, low-waisted jeans and a tiny white tank top. Her flat belly was exposed, showing off her perfect golden tan. Her top clung to her enormous, juicy, bouncy breasts. And by the way her hard nipples showed through the top, she was not wearing a bra. Her perfect blonde hair was done up on her head, and her piercing eyes and puffy lips were made her look like the sex bomb she was. 

Timmy didn't understand what he was seeing. She couldn't be here, but she was here. She looked fantastic, but something was off. She seemed to glow with some otherworldly light, highlighting her beauty in this dark atmosphere. 

"Mmm, so nice to see you here, Timmy." Jane gasped out, her voice breathy and airy, so unlike the seemingly reserved mature mother she always was around him. 

"How... How?" Timmy asked, the arrogant young man backing up in confusion. 

"I came hear to check up on Sal. I found out she was coming here, and I wanted to make sure she was okay. If I had known a big, strapping young man like you was here, I wouldn't have worried." Jane said, rubbing her palm along his fit bicep. 

"Uh, yeah, Mrs. S. I got this shit under control." Timmy said, his confusion being overwhelmed by his attraction to the mature, hot blonde with the massive tits in front of him. She got in close to him and pushed out her tits, exposing her cleavage to the black young man in front of her. 

Timmy couldn't help but stare. As his eyes got lost in the cavern between her massive jugs, he just couldn't look away. He was transfixed by the succulent flesh in front of him. If he could look up he would have seen the evil smile curl across her face. She stepped forward, entering the young man's personal space, and he had no way to stop her. 

"Timmy, are you okay, dude?" Tony said, slamming on the door. Tony looked around the room, hoping to find something to jar the door loose. He used all his strength to pull on the knob, but something was holding this door shut. Tony stood up and looked around, gathering his thoughts. He looked around and his eyes settled on the fireplace. Next to it was a cast iron poker that was built to stir up the wood in the fireplace. Tony ran over and grabbed it. He ran back to the door and jammed the poker between the door and the door frame, hoping to pry it open. He used all the strength in his body to try to force this door open and find out what happened to Timmy and to make sure he was alright. He didn't really like the guy, but he didn't want him hurt or anything. 

Timmy was not hurt. In fact, he couldn't be happier. He was lying on his back, pants around his knees, as Mrs. Jane Samson furiously rode his thick black cock. Timmy had his hands under her top, filling his hands with her gigantic tanned breasts. He pinched her hard nipples as she rode him. 

"Mmm, Timmy, I've wanted this for so long." Jane moaned out. 

"Mrs. S! You're incredible!" he gasped out. This woman was incredible. He just knew under her typical professional exterior she was a slut trying to get out. And holy fuck, this bitch could fuck! She was swiveling her hips as she rode him, and her cunt was the tightest fucking hole he had ever experienced, and he had fucked some girls in the ass. But Jane Sampson, this mature slut, had them all beat. 

"I'm better than all those teenage sluts, aren't I?" Jane asked. 

"Yes! Fuck yes!" Timmy praised, his eyes closing, the pleasure was so great. 

"OH! FUCK ME! You fuck me so much better than my husband! I love it! Timmy! Pledge yourself to me, and you will get everything you ever wanted." Mrs. S moaned out. "I'm gonna need this pleasure. I'm gonna need a strong young man satisfying my needs every day." 

"Whatever you want, baby. Whatever you want!" Timmy grunted out. He opened his eyes and tried to take in her voluptuous body, but he just couldn't get a good look at her. His vision was fuzzy, but he didn't really care. The pleasure of her tight, squeezing cunt was consuming his world. 

Tony was still at it, trying to force the door open. Finally, the wood could take no more, and the doorframe splintered, allowing the door to be opened. He dropped the fire poker and ripped the door open. 

He was staring into the darkness, unable to see anything. But he heard something, like some sort animal grunting. He pointed his flashlight within, until he saw movement. He saw what appeared to be something under a layer of dusty black fabric, writhing. Tony thought it was an animal or something. The noises coming from it were savage grunts, almost feral sounding. He moved the light around, and as he did, he saw Timmy on the floor, his pants around his ankles, and a huge smile on his face. The thing under the black fabric was on top of him, on top of his crotch. And then Tony saw the motion of limbs under the cloth, and his flashlight reflected off some long black hair, Tony suddenly realized the truth. A woman was on top of Timmy, wearing a dusty black covering. The savage grunting was coming from her, as she... as she... Holy shit. Tony realized the truth. This woman, whoever she was, was fucking Timmy. Tony didn't know who she was, this wild woman, he couldn't get a good look at her face. But she was just savagely riding Timmy, and he didn't appear to have any complaints. 

"Timmy! What are you doing!" Tony called out. Suddenly, the woman stopped writhing, and Tony could suddenly feel her turn her head and look at him. Before he could react, an unseen force shoved him from behind, sending him flying into the pantry, until he roughly hit the far wall face-first. He was knocked loopy, and the last thing he heard was the door slamming shut behind him, rendering the room pitch black. And now, he was trapped in this room, trapped with Timmy and this mystery woman. 

Tony was knocked silly and into a daze. He fell to his ass and leaned back against the wall he ran into it. As he began to regain his bearings, he heard footsteps approaching him, till he felt a presence directly in front of him. He didn't know who it was moving around, but he hoped it was Timmy. From within the darkness, a rustle of fabric was heard, and an almost ghostly pale, firm, bare female leg emerged. And it was a long leg... a smooth leg. So smooth... Tony shook his head and looked away, trying to escape the presence in front of him. But that was impossible. He felt the figure kneel in front of him, and he felt the presence move closer. He felt a breath at his ear. 

"We've got work to do." A ghostly female voice whispered into his ear. 

"AAAHH!" Tony screamed out, knowing he was in the presence of something deeply evil. 

He was not wrong. 

************* 

Unfortunately for the other people there, in the Cursed House of Crow, sound just seemed to die, so the noise made in the pantry was heard by none of the others. They just carried on blissfully unaware of the fact that they were under attack. Someone in the House was awake, and that person was not happy. 

Neither was Nadine. She had stomped away from Dom in a huff. She tried to just check out other rooms upstairs, but eventually, she just made her way back downstairs. She had settled into an uncomfortable chair in the living room and put her head in her hands, trying to hold back the tears. 

This just felt so wrong! She just knew her and Dom were supposed to be together. Whenever she thought of her and him as a couple, it just felt so right. It felt so meant to be. They would be so cute together! But no, he turned her away, just because she did a bit of light flirting with him. He got so mean with her, when the only crime she committed was liking him. Maybe he was afraid. Afraid of how much he actually did like her. That must be it. He pretends to like his dorky little girlfriend, but he still likes Nadine and wants to be with her. He didn't have to be so mean about it though. 

Nadine wiped away the tears. She didn't want anyone to see her like this. She didn't cry much in general. She wasn't that type of girl. She was the type to make other girl's cry, cause she was so much better than them in every way. She wasn't a girly girl, she was a tough chick. And as she wiped away the tears, she had to remind herself that tough chicks don't cry. 

As she got back to her feet, she thought about what Dom had said. Was he right? Did she come on too strong? Were him and her not truly meant to happen? No, it couldn't be. Dom just had to like her deep down. She knew it. And he would realize that when he saw her flirting with Timmy. That would make him jealous. She would hang off Timmy and show Dom what he was missing out on.  

===

Nadine sauntered forward towards the kitchen area, looking for Tony and Timmy. Her eyes scanned the room, noting the shelves and the cast iron stove. But what she didn't see was Tony and Timmy. She scrunched her eyes in confusion. Where the hell did they go? They didn't puss out, did they? 

Nadine was about to walk towards the front door and see if they had chickened out and went outside. She was stopped when she heard a noise. It was faint and muffled, but she could hear it. It sounded like... sucking. Vigorous, wet sucking. 

She followed the noise till she found herself in front of a door leading off from the kitchen. It looked like a pantry or something. Even though she thought this whole ghost thing was bullshit, she would admit she was a bit nervous by what she had seen so far. That face she saw in the window. This almost animal like sucking she was hearing. Something just felt... off. 

So, with trembling fingers, Nadine grabbed the door and pulled it open. 

She heard the sucking first. Now that the door was open, the sound was clear. But the room was still pitch-black, so she couldn't see the source of the noise. Flicking on her flashlight, she pointed it into the room. 

The light traveled along the dusty wooden floor, seeing nothing of note. That was until she saw a pair of shoes. She followed these shoes and used the light to travel up the legs of the shoe's owners. She saw a pair of bunched up jeans around his ankles, leaving his black legs bare. Nadine shined her light upward, to realize that on the floor was Timmy, his large dick out in the open, throbbing as he vigorously stroked it. His eyes were closed and he seemed blind to the world, lost in his own pleasure. 

Nadine was beyond confused. What the hell was he doing? Why was he stroking his impressively large cock, and in here of all places? 

"Timmy." Nadine called out. "What are you doing?" 

Timmy's eyes flashed open, revealing that they were glowing, in an inhuman red glow. Before she could really take this in, Nadine heard movement from the other end of the room. On instinct, she flashed her light towards the other side of the room, and what she saw stunned her. 

She saw a person, draped in a dusty black cloak, facing the wall, slightly bent over. This figure was moving slightly, shifting in place. The cloak was bulky, but judging by the figure's seemingly trim figure and long black hair, it appeared to be a woman. And that wet, sucking noise was coming from her direction. 

Nadine let the light trail to the ground, and it was only then she realized that this woman was standing over the large seated figure of Tony. Tony was seated against the wall, but everything above his waist was obscured by the woman in front of him and her bulky black cloak. The woman was bent over in front of him and pressed in close, her chest near his face, as if forcing something upon him. Tony was not fighting this invasion of his personal space. In fact, he was barely moving at all. 

And continuously, unstopping, was that same, sucking noise. It seemed to get louder, as if reverberating in Nadine's ears. In her head. In her mind. 

"Tony!?" Nadine called out. At this noise, the woman came to life, like a cockroach when the lights turned on. As quick as a flash, she ran to the side, disappearing behind some shelves, never once looking back. 

"Jesus!" Nadine screamed out, startled by her sudden motion. She was gone from sight in an instant, and Nadine watched as Tony, eyes glowing red, fell over onto his side. As if exhausted, his eyes lidded over as he fell into an instantaneous deep rest, his chest slowly rising and falling, creamy milk leaking from his open mouth. 

"Uh, jeez, uh..." Nadine gasped, backing away. She wanted to help, but she didn't want to go in there, with whoever that woman was. It couldn't be... no, it wasn't possible. Ghosts aren't real. But Nadine had to admit, that didn't look like a ghost. She looked very real. Then, who was she? 

Nadine didn't care to ask. She needed to get help. She needed to find Dom. He would know what to do. 

Leave it to an intrepid slut like Nadine to use even this attack on her friends as a way to get close to the man she wanted. 

*********** 

Sally ran her finger along the spine of a book she pulled from the bookshelf. She opened the first page and saw it was titled "The Mirror" in handwritten ink. She fanned through the pages until one page seemed to appear as the book fell open. The words on the page caught her eyes and she read through them. 

"You are not enough for him. You've always known that. You always knew his eyes would wander. You acted as if that weren't true, but deep down, you know you're not good enough. And you are not. The world will evolve, society will exist and grow whether you're a part of it or not. And he will move on, to someone more capable. And you will be forgotten. A faded memory, trapped within the sins of others. " 

Sally scrunched her eyebrows. It must be a diary or journal or something. Well, she would have more time for that later. She added this book to her stack of books next to her backpack. 

"What are you doing with all of these?" Alex asked, sauntering over next to her, eyeing the stack of books. He grabbed "The Mirror" from the top and fanned through it. 

"I'm uh, I'll take them home for a bit of light reading." Sally replied coyly. 

"You're taking them?" Alex asked. 

"Well, no one is gonna be looking for them." Sally justified. 

"Man, you're a bit more lawless than I thought." Alex said with a wry smile. "You're lucky I love you, or I'd call the cops on you." he added with a laugh. She giggled in response. 

The book he was holding slipped from his grasp as he only maintained a grip on one side of the book. The book was peeled open, one page pried apart. Alex regained his grip and he was to shut it when the words caught his eyes. He couldn't help but read them over. 

"All the wild women, the whores of the world, are yours for the taking. They will welcome you gladly, with open legs, ready rear ends, and magnificent breasts. The dark pleasures they can provide are the only things that can quench your desires. Your betrothed isn't enough. You know that. You say you love her. She's who you want, not what you need. You will betray her trust, in a manner vicious and true, and you will revel in her heartbreak. Her heart shattering will bring you pleasure. Cause your heart belongs to another. It's already too late. Your love has already began to fade from her and grow towards another. As you read these words, they invade your soul, making you mine. As I say your desire fades, your desire fades. As I say it rises, it rises. Your thirst for more grows as I put it to words, but the truth is these desires have always been there. Below the skin. All it required was for one as magnificent as myself to bring them to the surface. And I'm about to. I'll see you soon, my love, my future mate. 

M. C. October 3, 2012" 

"Hey, uh, Sally..." Alex began. She looked up at him, expectantly. Before he could finish... 

"Hey guys." Dom said, "Have you seen Nadine?" 

"What did you do, Dom?" Sally asked. 

"We, uh, we had a bit of a disagreement." Dom said. 

"Dom, I told you man, I told you to be nice to her." Alex said, distracted from his latest findings. 

"Yeah, dude, I know. She was just... you know how she gets. She was just pushing at me." Dom said, stepping inside. 

"Well, you'd better apologize." Sally said. "Don't bad mouth my best friend. Trust me, she'll make you regret it." 

"I know, I'll just let her cool off, then I'll talk to her." Dom said. "You guys find anything in here?" 

"Oh, yeah, lots of stuff." Sally began. "Lots of books. I don't have the chance to look at all of them now, but it looks like there's lots of good stuff here." 

"Hey, Sal, I was just gonna tell you..." Alex began, holding up "The Mirror." 

"DOM!" Nadine screamed out, running up the stairs. All of them turned their heads in confusion. They turned to look through the doorway, just in time for... 

"DOM!" Nadine screamed out again. Nadine ran past the study, not even taking a moment to look inside the room as she ran past. Sally, Alex and Dom watched her run past, and started to follow her. 

"Dom!" Nadine called out as she entered the bedroom. She stopped when she realized Dom wasn't in the room. She turned to exit the room, only for the door to slam shut in her face. Nadine grabbed the nob and tried to pull the door open, but it wasn't budging. She started pounding on the door. 

"Hey! Dom! Sally! Alex! Can you hear me?" she called out. 

Dom, Alex and Sally heard Nadine pounding on the stuck door. 

"Hey! Nadine! Can you hear me?" Alex called out. 

"Nadine!" Sally called out. Dom moved to grab the doorknob. He tried to pull it open, but it was stuck good. It wasn't moving. 

"Nadine!" Dom called out. "Are you okay? Can you hear us?" He didn't particularly like Nadine, but he didn't want her hurt. 

Unfortunately for Nadine, she couldn't hear them, even though they were about a foot away. Cause sound had a way of dying in the Cursed House of Crow, especially at the worst possible times. 

But even though Nadine couldn't hear her friends on the other side of the door, she did hear another noise. A very ominous noise. The long, whining groan of wood creaking from across the room. Nadine's eyes widened as she heard this. The door was stuck, and she had no choice but to turn around and face the source of this noise head on. Slowly, she spun to meet her fate. 

On the opposite corner of the room, seated in a chair, was the same cloaked figure as before. The top of her was bathed in shadow, but her legs and waist were visible. Nadine stared, wide-eyed at this cloaked figure. 

"Who are you?" Nadine asked, her voice shaking with fear. The seated woman didn't answer. For a few moments, she didn't even move. Then, without any words, she responded. 

The seated woman's legs began to spread. Nadine watched as the woman's ghostly white hand pulled up the bottom of her black covering, exposing her bare, pale white legs. She exposed more and more pale flesh, and finally, she pulled the cloak over her waist, exposing herself to Nadine. Nadine stared at her, wide- eyed. She should be horrified, but she couldn't look away. She just kept staring at the seated woman, and the flesh she was exposing. She was the last girl who would ever be into chicks, but something about the sight of this exposed woman was mesmerizing. Something about this sight made her lick her lips. Something about this sight made her drool with lust. 

"Why isn't this door opening?" Alex grunted out, pushing at the door with all of his strength, but it wasn't budging at all. He pulled away and let Dom try, but he didn't have any luck. 

"Nadine, if you're okay, let me know!" Sally called out through the door, but there was no response. 

"Hey..." Alex began, "Let's go get Tony and Timmy. They can get this door open, I bet." he suggested. 

"Yeah, good thinking." Sally replied, "Dom, you keep trying, we'll get the guys." Sally grabbed Alex's arm as she led him downstairs. Dom watched them walk away, and as soon as they were out of sight, he turned to focus on the door. He stretched out his arms, cracked his knuckles, and readied himself to use all of his strength to get the door open. 

He put his hand on the nob, turned the handle, and reared back to drive his shoulder into the door. 

The door popped right open. 

He wasn't expecting this outcome, so he kinda fell through the doorway as his driving shoulder missed the now open door. He stumbled in to the bedroom but regained his bearings quickly. 

"Nadine." he called out, looking around the room. The doorknob slipped from his fingers and the door slowly slid back into place, closing itself. Dom looked around, searching the dark room for Nadine. But he didn't see her, at first. 

What caught his attention at first were the whispers. He heard whispers carry through the darkness, audible enough to be noticed, but just quiet enough to be unintelligible. His ears followed the noise, and his eyes were drawn into the corner. It was there that he saw her. 

The light from outside shone through the dusky window, illuminating Nadine. She was on her hands and knees, facing the corner. She was locked in place, not moving from her position, but she was moving a bit. Her butt was swaying , and her head was moving around actively. Dom looked into the corner, and it was then he realized there was someone else in this room. 

She blended into the shadows. The corner itself in front of Nadine was black, as the light from the window didn't reach that far. It was there that this figure sat, in a chair in front of Nadine. This figure was dressed in a dusty black coat, which helped her blend into the darkness. And it became clear to Dom that that this figure was a woman when he realized what Nadine was up to. 

Nadine was on all fours, between the woman's legs. And this woman had lifted up her cloak, so even though her legs were bathed in shadow, their ghostly paleness allowed the trim, clearly feminine legs to be seen in the darkness. And Nadine, she was between the woman's spread legs, her face nestled in this mystery woman's crotch, her tongue lapping at the vagina in front of her. 

"Nadine!" Dom called out, in shock. What was she doing? Why was she licking this woman's vagina? What the fuck was going on? 

But Nadine was undeterred. She ignored Dom, for the first time ever. She just kept on lovingly licking the plump, bare mature pussy in front of her. She lapped at it like a cat, giving the full length of the cunt the pleasure of her wet tongue. Nadine nibbled, licked, and sucked at the cunt, completely enthralled by the act. Which was strange for a girl who always used the word lesbo or dyke as a vicious insult when girls showed even the slightest bit of affection towards each other. But now there she was, lapping at a woman's pussy and seemingly loving every minute of it. 

"What are you doing?" Dom called out. But again, Nadine ignored him. Dom watched, frozen to the spot, as a hand emerged from the shadows, equally pale as her legs. Her fingers curled out and patted Nadine's head appreciatively. 

And the whispering persisted. Dom tried to listen, but he couldn't make out the words. And the whispers got louder, like waves crashing into his ears. He could hear the noise but he just couldn't make out the words. He looked at Nadine, and the woman she was pleasuring. Nadine was looking up at the woman, worshipfully, and it seemed like something was being shared between them. That maybe these whispers were meant for Nadine to hear and not Dom. Nadine went on, pleasuring the woman in front of her. And the whispers got louder... and louder. 

And then they stopped. 

Nadine pulled away from the woman with a warm pop. Saliva and sexual juices connected Nadine's open mouth to the pussy of the woman in front of her. Nadine's body moved for the first time, rising into a kneeling position. Then, in one smooth motion, like a serpent, she turned to stare at Dom. 

And her eyes glowed a burning red. 

"Nadine?" Dom asked. She was staring at him hungrily. It was a look he had gotten more than once from her. But something about this was different. It was more confident. Not that she wasn't confident normally, but as she got to her feet, something about her seemed more... self-assured. 

She got to her feet, and slowly, confidently, she began to walk forward, towards him. Like a hunter circling her prey. It was as if she knew she had him wrapped around her finger. He couldn't rip his eyes from her growing gaze. 

"What are you doing? Are you okay?" Dom asked, stepping back. Something was wrong with her. Dom looked over her shoulder at the woman in the corner, and she just sat in place, as if watching the proceedings in front of her. What was up with her? Was she possessed or something? Was the woman in the corner controlling her? Wait, this was ridiculous! 

"I'm fine, Dom." she said assuredly. 

"Who is that?" Dom asked, nodding at the woman, still unable to break her eyeline. 

"Don't worry about her. Focus on me." Nadine said, glancing at her own body, guiding his eyes down to the only thing that could pull his eyes away from her otherworldly gaze. His eyes fell to her giant tits, which is where she obviously wanted him to look. Despite his dislike of her, he had to admit her body was spectacular. She had curves where they mattered. Nice, firm legs. A juicy rear-end. And perfectly ripe, succulent big tits. 

Typically, these things didn't matter to him. He wasn't that type of guy. He wasn't that shallow. To him, it was a point of pride that his girlfriend wasn't conventionally beautiful. He was the type of guy who kind of liked the fact that his girl-friend had a flat-chest and no ass to speak of. He liked the fact that she dressed down, and downplayed her looks. She was a pretty girl, but she had such character and personality. He thought about her. All the good times they had. And how much he loved her. 

But why was he suddenly having trouble remembering her name? 

And had Nadine's tits always been that big? 

Dom couldn't look away. They just looked huge in that top, which clung to her chest. Her hard nipples were apparent from under it, and they looked like they were positively throbbing. Dom tried to look away, but all he could think was... were those DD's? 

Dom shook his head, meeting her gaze again. Her glowing, red gaze. He had to not let himself be taken in by her abundant charms. He had to fight for what's- her-name. 

"What's wrong, baby? Having trouble focusing?" Nadine asked, her voice filled with lust. 

"What are you doing?" Dom asked. Something was wrong. In his head. She was doing something to him. He never thought like this? He never thought of girl's cup sizes? He never wondered about just how nasty Nadine was in the sack. He never wondered if she could take all of his thick cock down her throat. He never wondered if she would let him fuck her massive tits. He never wondered if she had one of those extra tight cunts he had heard so much about. He never wondered how much of his cock Nadine would take up her extra-tight asshole. Probably the whole thing. She would probably spread her cheeks like an eager slut and beg for the whole fucking length. Then suck it right after like a nasty whore would. And she would swallow his creamy load and beg for more. And she would get it. She would fucking get it... wait, what? 

Dom shook his head. What the fuck was happening? He had to get out of here. He turned for the door and attempted to escape. But, of course, the door wouldn't budge. He turned to face Nadine, who was slowly approaching. She seemed to be dripping with darkness. Dom was starting to think she truly was possessed. 

"What happened to you? What are you doing?" Dom asked. "What did you do to her?" Dom called out to the woman in the corner. This couldn't be happening. There was no way the myths could be true. But what other explanation could there be. 

"I told you to focus on me." Nadine said, drawing his attention to her. As he looked, she produced an old looking knife from her pocket. Dom stepped back. Nadine, her confident smile never wavering, took the knife and brought it to her neck. 

"No!" Dom called out, afraid she was gonna hurt herself. But before he could do anything, she brought the knife to the neck of her top and proceeded to cut at her shirt. The shirt peeled apart like the knife was cutting through butter. She slid the knife down her front, and as she did, her massive breasts began to try to force their way out. As she reached the hem of her top, her bra-covered breasts practically exploded out of them, forcing the ruined shirt to fall to the floor in tatters. 

Nadine's upper half was now only covered in a lacy black bra, and her tits were so ripe and juicy they were practically falling out of it. The smooth, caramel flesh was literally pouring from her bra, yearning to be free.  

===

Again, his view of her glowing eyes was broken as his eyes were drawn to her deep cleavage. So deep, deep enough to make him wish he could fall into it face first and never escape. 

"Nadine!" Dom called out. "Wake up!" Dom knew she was a slut, but he knew that this wasn't her. She wouldn't be this brazen. This was something else. A new force entirely. 

"Dom, don't you realize this is what we both want?" Nadine asked, getting closer. She stopped, unzipped her jeans, and slowly pulled them off. She stepped out of them and continued slowly approaching, now clad only in her underwear. 

Her panties matched her bra, black lace and tiny. Dom had to guess she was wearing a thong, knowing her like he did. 

"You want me, Dom. You want my body." Nadine whispered huskily, her lust-filled voice like a serpent, weaving around his mind. "You've wanted me all along. I know it. You've run from it for so long, but I know the truth. You love me. You have been in love with me for years. And deep down, you want to make our love official. You want to ditch the girlfriend, that pathetic excuse for a girl, and be with me, a real woman. A slut who will take care of you like you need. Who will give you everything you ever needed. Who will do anything you want." 

"Nadine. I love her. I can't do this. This is wrong! Even you know that, deep down. This isn't you. This is her work, isn't it?" he asked, nodding at the woman in the corner. 

"Don't worry about her. She just wants to watch us have our fun." Nadine purred. Dom backed against the door. Nadine approached her prey, knowing she had him trapped. She stepped in close, pressing her large rack into his chest. 

"Mmm, that's nice. Here's what's gonna happen. Here's what you want to happen. Here's what you've always wanted to happen. You are gonna make me yours. You are going to be betray your little girlfriend and choose me. Forever. After tonight, you will know which girl you belong to. Who owns your heart. Your soul. It has to happen this way. Cause betrayal is just so yummy. You have to know what I'm capable of. Just imagine, seeing what I'm capable of, combined with the vicious betrayal against your girlfriend, that will make the sex so much better. We were destined to do this. Destined to become lovers. We were made for each other." Nadine whispered. 

She pressed herself in tight, pressing her large breasts against him. She pressed her belly against him, feeling his desire for her. Without a fight, Nadine took his hands and placed them against her ass-cheeks, exposed by the teeny tiny thong she had tucked snugly between her cheeks of her hot Latina ass. Nadine felt him reflexively squeeze her ass-cheeks. 

"Just look into my eyes, Dom. I will make all your troubles go away." she whispered. She looked up, and his eyes locked onto hers. Her glowing eyes held his stare, as her lips slowly approached his. 

************ 

As soon as Alex and Sally hit the ground floor, they went searching for their two friends. 

"Hey guys!" Alex called out urgently. They looked around, but saw no sign of their two friends. 

"They better not have wussed out." Sally said to Alex. "Timmy! Tony!" she called out. 

Suddenly, footsteps were heard from the kitchen. Down the hallway in the kitchen emerged the two young men. 

"There you are." Sally said, relieved. Neither of them reacted as they approached the couple. 

"Guys, the door is jammed upstairs and Nadine is stuck inside!" Alex explained quickly. Again, neither of them reacted as they confidently approached. Alex noticed small smiles on both of their faces. 

"Guys, what's wrong?" he asked. As he looked at them, something seemed off. Then he saw their eyes. 

They glowed red. 

"Hey..." he began. Before he could finish, Tony reared back and took a swing at Alex. 

"Aaaah!" Sally squealed out. Alex ducked, dodging Tony's fist. 

"Hey!" Alex called out. Timmy jumped forward, trying to grab Alex. 

"Timmy!" Alex grunted out as Timmy grabbed the collar of his shirt. Alex grabbed his forearms to pull them away, but as he did, Tony jumped forward, drilling Alex with a punch to the gut. 

"What are you doing?" Sally squealed out, jumping away. Alex fell to the ground, gasping for air. Timmy tried to grab his wrists, but Alex reacted, swinging back, hitting the side of Timmy's head with his elbow. The force knocked Timmy back, but he didn't react at all to the pain. Alex tried to get to his feet. Tony ran forward to punch him again. Alex was able to duck, rear back, and punch back at him, cracking Tony in the jaw. That punch should have had him down for the count, but he merely recoiled before going on the attack again. 

"Sally, get out of here!" Alex called out, trying to protect her. 

"No!" Sally said. She grabbed a vase from near the chimney, and moved to hit Tony on the head with it. As if seeing behind himself, Tony turned and shoved Sally into the wall roughly, knocking her into a daze as her head drilled into the wall. 

She was seeing double, and in her daze, she saw Tony and Timmy overwhelm Alex, grabbing his legs and arms, dragging him towards the kitchen. 

"Sallly!" Alex called out, but by the time Sally's head cleared, Alex was gone and his voice had disappeared. Sally got to her feet and chased after Tony and Timmy. 

She had no time to think about what had happened. She just had to find Alex. She ran to the kitchen, and saw no signs of life. She checked the side rooms, the pantry, out the windows, but saw nothing. She heard a bang from upstairs. Fuck, she forgot! Nadine! And Dom! They could help! They just have to get that door open. Sally sprinted upstairs. 

She reached the landing, and as soon as she did she saw the door was open. Relieved, she ran towards it, pushing it open. She came to a stop when she saw what was inside. 

"OOOHHHHH! FUCK YES! FUCK YES! FUCK ME!" Nadine screamed out. 

Sally was frozen. In front of her was Dom and Nadine, both completely naked, and they were fucking. Hard. Dom was standing in the middle of the room and was holding up Nadine, the backs of her knees in the crooks of his arms, her arms around his neck as she furiously rode him. Both were covered with sweat, which appeared to be literally dripping onto the floor. Sally couldn't help but notice Nadine's huge breasts against Dom's rock hard chest. Her perfect ass flexing as she bounced. Dom's muscles straining as he held the slut in his arms. And what appeared to be a very large cock driving into Nadine. 

"What are you doing?" Sally asked, not understanding what she was seeing. But of course, they ignored her. 

"FUCK ME, BABY! FUCK ME! GIVE ME THAT FAT FUCKING COCK! DRIVE IT IN ME! GIVE ME THAT CUM! KNOCK UP YOUR LITTLE SLUT!" Nadine moaned out in pleasure. 

"FUCK I LOVE IT!" Dom grunted out. 

"I knew it! I FUCKING knew it! I knew you loved me!" Nadine squealed out. "Forget about your stupid, ugly fucking girlfriend! You belong to me now!" 

"YES! FUCK YES!" Dom grunted, more beast than man. 

"What the fuck is going on?" Sally screamed out. Both Dom and Nadine turned to look at Sally. Both smirked, and their eyes blazed red. 

"What's wrong Sally?" Dom asked, smiling wide. 

"What's wrong, hun?" Nadine asked, kissing Dom on the cheek over and over again. 

"What the fuck? What the fuck?" Sally asked herself, backing away as the two lovers laughed and resumed their vicious copulation. Sally turned and ran back downstairs. 

"Is this what you wanted to see?" Dom asked, turning to face the corner, where the woman in black was still seated, watching the action. Dom could practically feel her smile. 

Sally stumbled away from the action. What the fuck was happening? Something had happened to everyone! But what? What happened? It couldn't be the so-called witch? No, that wasn't possible! That whole thing was a myth. But what could be happening? Were they poisoned or drugged or something? But their eyes? What could explain that? 

Sally ran downstairs and hit the ground floor. The room was still and silent, which sent a cold chill through her bones. Sally looked behind her, at the front door. It was cracked open, some light spilling in. 

She could just leave. Leave and go get some help, because something was happening here that was more than she could understand. She should go. Alex told her to. Alex... no, she had to stay. She had to find Alex. She wasn't leaving without him. 

But where could he be? She looked through all the rooms in the first floor. She racked her brain, trying to think of anything she had learned in her research. The living room. The bedroom. The study. There was the kitchen, the pantry, the basement... wait, the basement! The room where Madeline was found. Where she was captured. Of course! The basement! She hadn't found the basement. That's where they were. They had to be. 

Sally ran away from the front door, towards the kitchen. She looked around, looking for any secret door. She ripped open the pantry door. She was about to look inside when... 

"Aaah!" she squealed out. Tony and Timmy emerged from the darkness in front of her. She turned to run away. She ran back towards the front when... 

"Shit!" Sally called out. In front of her where Dom and Nadine, both nude. Both were still sweaty. Dom's large dick was hanging between his legs, and cum was leaking from Sally's best friend's pussy. 

"Don't worry, Sally." Nadine purred. "We won't hurt you." 

Before she could move, Tony grabbed her arms roughly from behind. Timmy slipped a black hood over her head. 

"No! No!" Sally called out as the cloth covered her vision. She tried to fight back from the strong arms holding her, but it was of no use. She tried to keep fighting, but something on the cloth was making her woozy. Within moments, she was being dragged along the floor, her heels dragging on the floor as Tony dragged her in his arms to the basement. 

Where the woman in black awaited. 

************** 

The smell was the thing that woke up Sally. It smelled hot, like a source of heat was nearby. There was also a burning smell, which led her to think something was cooking nearby. 

She started to stir a bit, and it was only then that the black hood was ripped off her head, revealing to her where she was. 

The room she was in, no doubt the basement of the house of Crow, looked to be made of dark stone. This room looked alien in relation to the house above. Torches hung from the wall, casting an orange hue throughout the room. Strange artifacts and decorations filled the room, as if tools for some mystic or something. 

In front of her was a large, cast iron cauldron, gurgling due to the fire beneath it. Behind the cauldron stood Timmy, looking back at her. Behind them, on a bed on the other side of the room, were Nadine and Dom, fucking roughly, doggy-style, dripping with sweat. Sally turned away from them, and it was then that she noticed, lying on a bed to the left of the cauldron, was Alex, a black hood over his face as well. He wasn't awake, but his chest rose with his breathing. 

"Alex?" Sally called out, moving to stand from the wooden chair she was in. Before she could, Tony's large hands reached down from behind her and forced her to stay seated. Breathing deeply in fear and confusion, she looked around some more, only to notice that to the right of the cauldron, bathed in shadow, was the woman in black. 

Her upper half was bathed in shadow, but her lower half was visible, wearing a dusty black cloak. She sat in her chair, facing Sally, as if watching her... appraising her. 

"Who are you?" Sally gasped, having an idea of who she might be, but afraid to admit it, and what that might mean. 

For a few seconds, the only sound heard was the gurgling of the cauldron. Finally, the woman moved, her hands grabbing the armrests on the chair, her ghostly pale hands visible. The woman rose from the seat, and something about this motion frightened Sally, as if this was final proof that this mystery woman was indeed real. 

She stepped forward, approaching Sally. Her shoes clicked menacingly on the wooden floor. As she walked forward, more of her emerged from the darkness. She slowly approached, walking almost menacingly slow, like a hunter approaching wounded prey. More of her cloaked body emerged into the light, until only her head was still hidden from Sally. 

"So nice to finally meet you, Sally." the mystery woman said, her calm, British accent reaching Sally's ears. The woman stepped forward, emerging from the shadows. Sally moved back in her seat and gasped in fear and shock, her chin quivering. She was seeing what could only be a ghost. She couldn't explain what she was seeing. Because standing in front of her was a person who couldn't be there. A person who supposedly died 300 years ago. 

Madeline Crow. 

Her face looked the same as it did in the paintings. She looked like a 40- something woman, and she had maintained the good looks she appeared to have in all the art of her. Her skin was pale, but a nice, creamy pale. Her face looked to be very elegant and classy, not like a crazed woman like most visualized witches being. Her eyes were a cool grey, and she had very thin eyebrows. Her mouth seemed very tightly drawn, but her lips were plump. She had very few wrinkles, as someone should if they were born over 300 years ago. Her hair was long and black past her shoulders, shiny in the firelight. A streak of light blonde, almost grey hair interrupted her liquid black hair, providing the only interruption in the waves of black falling from her head. 

"I've been keeping an eye on you for some time now, Miss Samson." Madeline said, her voice cool and unaffected by the fear she was causing. 

"How... how are you here? Are you a gh... a ghost?" Sally said, not believing what she was asking. 

"Sally, you know there is no such thing as ghosts." Sally said with a small smile, removing her black cloak. Underneath, she was wearing colonial clothing, clothing fit for a pilgrim from her day. She wore a gray vest over a black shirt and a long black dress down to her ankles. She handed her dusty cloak to Timmy, and he moved to hang it up. Once he did, he ran back and moved Madeline's chair forward, out of the darkness, closer to Sally. 

Madeline was quite tall, so it felt like she towered over the seated girl. Once her chair was in place, she sat back down, straightening her dress as she did so. 

"My journey here was a long and winding one." Madeline began. "The product of a corrupt church and how that corruption can spread among even the best of people. How they attacked and persecuted people without evidence. How they persecute and condemn the innocent to protect their own agenda. Me and my friends fell victim to this... betrayal. A culture of fear created by a corrupt church to trick people into accepting their attempts for power. My peers and I were persecuted unjustly. My life destroyed. My husband killed. My children ripped from my breast. All to further the church's grip on society." 

"But... how are you still alive?" Sally asked. Even in her fear, she was ever inquisitive. 

"The church, in their infinite wisdom, decided to place a curse on me." Madeline replied. 

"A curse?" Sally asked. 

"Yes, despite of their attitude on witchcraft, the church had more knowledge of the dark arts than any of their accused witches. They cursed me, bound me to this house, waiting for me to die, so they could, in their words, 'protect the innocent'." Madeline explained. 

"But, how is that possible? There is no such thing as witchcraft, or magic." Sally said. Madeline smiled as she looked at the girl as if she were simple. 

"Dear, I thought much higher of you. I think all the proof of magic is the person staring you in the face. A woman who was born more than 300 years ago is standing in front of you, and you wonder if magic is possible." Madeline said. Sally didn't know how to reply, so Madeline continued. "They cursed me to this house, so I could not escape. Trapped from the outside world, so they were protected from me." 

"Why couldn't you escape?" Sally asked. 

"Because I COULDN'T!" Madeline said, a crazed look in her eyes. "Because the house wouldn't let me! I would approach the door, stare out at the outside world, but a force greater than me blocked me from taking that step outside. It was hell. It was torture to see the world moving and be stuck in here, in this prison. I'm afraid I went slightly mad." Madeline said with a crazed giggle. 

"But how are you still alive?" Sally asked. 

"Can you really be considered alive if you can't die?" Madeline proposed, confusing Sally. "I outsmarted them. Out-thought their plan. But it cost me my soul. I sold my soul to maintain my life. To outlive those who placed the curse on me, so that one day I would get my freedom. And my revenge." 

"What do you mean, you sold your soul? Sold to who?" Sally wondered. Madeline smiled. 

"It's not about who, dear." Madeline said mysteriously. "You'll realize that selling your soul is not a simple transaction. It means sacrificing any purity in a desperate maneuver to preserve life." she added vaguely. 

"Wait, what are you talking about?" Sally asked. 

"Dear, do you truly not understand yet?" Madeline asked, looking at the teenager like she was simple, again. "Do you not know yet...?" 

"Sally..." Madeline began, "I am a witch." 

"Ha!" Sally barked, "No way." 

"I am a witch." Madeline reaffirmed. "I have been all my life. From my youth, I felt... different. I had this power I couldn't explain. I could do things I wasn't able to do. I tried to hide it. Tried to suppress it. But the more I did, the more it came out in unexpected ways. It wasn't until I came to this country and we settled here that I came across a book. A book which explained how to harness my power. I couldn't resist the temptation." 

"No. This isn't right. You weren't a witch. You were just providing protection, a safe haven to the accused. Protecting them from the church's witch hunt." Sally said. 

"I was protecting them. Cause they were my students. My apprentices. I taught them everything they knew. Before me, they were just whores. But with me, they were something more." Madeline explained. Sally looked on, in disbelief. Madeline slightly rolled her eyes, before holding out her palm. Sally watched in shock as a goblet flew from across the room, landing in her palm. Sally sat wide-eyed at this seeming proof of Madeline's talents. 

"But then, it's your fault. Your housing these apprentices put your family in danger. Put them at risk." Sally questioned. 

"NO!" Madeline said angrily, setting down the goblet. "I did not put my family in danger. The church did that. The church made this a war. My family was taken from me because of their fear of what they don't understand. The church attacked me out of fear of what I could do. Fear that I would threaten their grip on society. The church operates on fear! They cursed me and believed they had me defeated. But alas, they did not. I found a spell on my own, a spell no sane witch would normally even touch. I had to make terrible sacrifices, terrible sacrifices..." she repeated, staring off in silence, "I made these sacrifices, and it bought me time. Bought me time to watch from here, and figure out how to escape from this prison. I paid for immortality with my very soul, and I intend not only to escape, but to get my humanity back as well." she said. 

"I have watched for years from here. Watched society get more and more corrupted, watched darkness overtake this society. In my time, they saw me as evil. Now, I would fit right in." Madeline added. 

"How did you watch society from here?" Sally asked. 

"Oh, I have my eyes all over this city." Madeline replied coyly. Sally suddenly recalled the paintings of Madeline all over town, and the way their eyes seemed to follow you. "That was how I kept myself sane. Focused. I was able to learn, to adapt my language to match yours. I watched from afar as every facet of society was corrupted. The church. The government. The schools. All of them are now corrupt bodies, destroying society, infecting it from the inside. That's how I saw you. Asking around, pleading for my case to be heard. I admire your integrity and your drive. You would have been a perfect student for someone like me. Too bad it was not meant to be. The influence of the coven has been snuffed out, buried in their corruptions, yearning to be free. My influence must be made, my words must be heard, my talents must be taught. And I will thank you, because you have bought me my ticket out of here."  

===

Sally looked around, studying her friends. Dom and Nadine were still fucking the shit out of each other. Timmy was standing in place, awaiting others. Tony was still behind her, standing guard. And Alex was still unconscious on the bed. 

"What did you do to my friends?" Sally asked. 

"It's been so long since I've had the chance to test my powers. And I am heartened to see your friends took to it so, so quickly. They were dying to have my influence in their lives. Nice to know my skills are still strong." Madeline said. 

"Your skills?" Sally asked. 

"Your friends belong to me now." Madeline explained to her. "I used some of my favorite spells on them, and they took to them like they were born to serve. And now, your friends care for me more than they ever cared about you. They now live to make me happy and make sure my wishes come true. They no longer care about their relationship with you. They don't like you anymore, but now, they love me." 

"What?" Sally declared. Without saying a word, the others spoke up. 

"I love you, Madeline." Tony said from behind Sally. 

"Love ya, baby." Timmy said. 

"I love you, Ms. Crow." Dom called out. 

"I fucking love you, Madeline." Nadine screamed out, still getting roughly fucked. 

"I attacked these four, but neither you nor your boyfriend. You both are still clear headed. I need you two for the last part of my plan." Madeline said. "This cloth keeps him frozen in place. He can hear everything we have said. He knows exactly what I am. He knows exactly what I've done. I'm gonna want you to remember that after what happens next." With that she stood up and strode over to the prone Alex. She reached down and ripped off the black fabric covering his face, and as soon as the fabric was gone, Alex woke up. 

"What the fuck... what's going on?" he called out, lifting himself up onto his elbows. He didn't know how to explain what had just happened to him. 

"Alex!" Sally called out. "Are you okay?" 

"Sal, are you okay?" Alex asked. 

"I'm fine." Sally said, moving to stand, but Tony held her by the shoulders in a seated position. 

"What happened to me?" Alex asked, looking around for the first time, studying his surroundings. He thought he was in one of those nightmares where you are paralyzed, but once he awoke and noticed his strange surroundings, he began to realize he wasn't dreaming. He was truly in the nightmare. 

"What is this?" he moved to look back at Sally, but just as he did, Madeline stepped between them. 

"Hello Alex." Madeline said. 

"This can't be real." Alex said, studying her. Beginning to recognize her, he pulled back. "Is this... are you... are you really...?" 

"Madeline Crow. Nice to finally meet you." Madeline said. Alex backed up, not believing what he was seeing. 

"What's going on?" he asked. 

"Let me explain what's about to happen, dear." Madeline began, sitting on the end of the bed. She reached forward to grab his hand but he pulled away. Timmy stepped forward and grabbed him by the wrist, forcing him to hold his hand out so she could take it. Once she did, she gripped his hand roughly, not wanting to let it go. Her palm was cold to the touch. Despite the fact that he was a strong young and her, by all appearances at least, a normal, mature woman, he couldn't free his hand from her grip. 

"Listen!" Madeline said firmly, moving in closer. Unable to get away from her, she moved closer till she was sitting right next to him. He pushed himself against the wall, but she pushed herself close to him, so he was trapped. She moved her mouth to his ear and spoke. 

"Let me tell you what's about to happen," Madeline repeated, her voice silky smooth. "I put a spell your friends, but I would never do that to someone like you. They're all my subjects, but that is because someone like me can entrance weak minds in my sleep. All of them are weak, driven by insecurity. Tony... he's afraid he's too dumb to be loved. Timmy... he so desperately wants to be seen as a man and to be taken seriously as one. Nadine... she's afraid she'll end up alone, so she pushes too hard on those she desires. And Dom... you're best friend, even he is just like the rest. He wants to be mysterious, so he places these facile layers on to distract people from the fact that he is just like everyone else." 

"But you two... you and Sally, you two are more than that. You two have substance. You two are very interesting. Your girlfriend there, she is wise beyond her years. An old soul. A brilliant mind. A spirit for knowledge that is unmatched. And so untouched by the corruption of society. She is pure. Innocent. You couldn't ask for more from a girl. And you, my dear. You are something special. A natural leader. A wise mind. An old soul, like your girlfriend. Someone who has substance. A person who always thinks of others before himself. A person who would rather have everyone else be happy even if it means a sacrifice on his part. A person who has found true love at a young age and never wavered from that. Your parents must be so proud of you. As her parents are of her, no doubt. You both are model citizens and wonderful people." Madeline paused. 

Alex looked at her, confused. Where was she going with this? Unfortunately, he was about to find out. Madeline spoke up again. 

"That's why it'll be so much fun to break you." 

She moved in even closer, really invading his personal space, making him shiver. She began to whisper into his ear, loud enough for both him and Sally to hear. 

"I'm going to convince you to betray your girlfriend. I'm going to lay out my case, logically. You're a smart young man, so I will lay out the facts, a finely-tuned argument 300 years in the making, and you will have no choice but to take my side, because it is the correct one. And, in doing so, you will betray your true love, viciously and brutally. You will choose me instead of her. Your heart will lie with me after tonight, and you will disregard the love of your life for something so... much... better." 

"You will betray your cute, young, bright girlfriend in favor of a witch, frozen in the body of a 45-year old, but so much older in spirit. A woman who practices the dark arts. An admitted witch of the highest order. A woman who's power in witchcraft is unparralled. A woman who has converted countless numbers into her followers. A woman who trained many in her talents. A woman's whose power was so great it threatened the influence of the church. A woman who the church and society has classified as 'evil', someone bathing in the waters of sin. They call me 'The Devil's Mistress'. Someone dark of spirit and mind. Someone too dangerous to be allowed to even interact with others. My influence is too great. My skills are too powerful. A woman who has enslaved your friends. I'm telling you all of this so you both know exactly who you're dealing with. So that despite these so-called negative qualities, this is the woman who you are starting to fall for." 

"What? What are you talking about?" Alex asked, confused. 

"You're going to betray your girlfriend and choose me. No magic. No spells. Just you and me. Two people. And, in committing this betrayal, you will provide me with the final ingredient which will allow me to escape from my prison." Madeline said. 

Alex looked away from this woman near him. Sally had led him here to prove this woman was innocent, but not only was this woman proven to be a witch, she was still alive and on the attack. She wasn't bombastic like a movie villain. She was sinewy and velvety, like a serpent, uncomfortably intimate. She seemed relatively clear-headed, but every so often, her eyes would flash with insanity, exposing the madness within. Alex was rarely flustered, but here and now, he had to admit he was afraid. He glanced over at Sally, and she was just as nervous and fearful. 

"And now it's time to show you my most powerful weapon. The thing that made the church so terrified of me." Madeline said. Madeline released his hand, and he pulled away and sat against the wall, not wanting to look at her but not knowing what else to do. Despite his hopes otherwise, it felt like an unseen force was forcing him to stare at the witch stood near the cauldron. 

Sally and Alex were both watching as Madeline stood before them, light from the torches flickering across her colonial clothing. For a few moments there was a tense silence. The only sounds heard was the wet squelching of Dom's dick as Nadine rode him on the far side of the basement. Madeline looked at Alex and Sally, watching them, making sure their eyes were on her. Then, she acted. 

She brought her hands to her chest and brought her fingers to the buttoned up seam in the middle of the shirt. She reached inside of her top, slipping her fingers between the buttons, giving her a grip on each side of her top. Then, in one fluid motion, she ripped her top apart, sending the buttons flying. She stretched her arms back so the tattered clothing could fall from her arms, onto the floor. As it did, her skirt, seemingly on its own accord, followed it, leaving Madeline Crow standing in a pool of clothing, completely naked. 

Madeline stood resplendent, standing nude before the teenagers in front of her. Sally and Alex couldn't help but take her body in. And they were taking it in, as it was a body built to be taken in. 

Madeline's flesh shined in the darkness, her skin as pale as snow. Her skin was so creamy and pale she could truly be mistaken for a ghost. She had not been in the sun for hundreds of years, so of course she would be pale. But on her, this paleness was not a negative. She worked this look to perfection. 

A lot of colonial clothing was made for full coverage in order to prevent indecent thoughts in others. Clothes made to hide the body, to prevent people from indulging in the sins of the flesh. And it became clear to both Alex and Sally that this bulky colonial clothing did its job, because neither of them had any idea, until now, that Madeline Crow had a hot fucking body. 

It wasn't until they saw Madeline in the flesh how incredibly sexy she was. Sure, they had noticed that she was a beautiful, elegant, classy looking woman, but her body didn't scream class. It screamed sex. It screamed of the dark delights she could offer. 

Madeline had long, firm legs, lightly muscled in just the right way. Her firm thighs were evident even in the darkness. Between her legs was her pussy, completely devoid of hair, so they could clearly see the puffy lips of her sexy, mature cunt. She had wide, child bearing hips, and her belly as flat and fit, the only interruption in the pale expanse of sexy belly being her small, sexy belly button. But none of these aspects of her body were as eye catching as what came next. 

Madeline Crow had gigantic breasts. They were monster tits. Just terrifyingly large. They appeared to be incredibly soft. And perfectly round, and cleavage formed naturally in just the right way. And they just stood magically firm, standing proud on her chest, defying her age. They almost looked swollen, pulsing with desire. And her round, rubbery nipples looked they were throbbing, just begging for a mouth to bite, chew, suck, and worship them. The flesh of her chest looked unblemished, just a perfect set of massive, firm, mature breasts. 

Madeline spun slowly and bent over, leaning both hands on the bubbling cauldron, pointing her ass at both Alex and Sally. And it held up its end of the bargain. It was full and round and firm, two perfect cheeks. Her ass was a masterpiece, a heart-shaped piece of perfection. 

The long expanse of her back was exposed, and it was as firm and sexy as the rest of her. The only interruption of this pale expanse was her silky black hair, which hung past her shoulders. 

Madeline spun back around and faced the young lovers again and saw the awe in their eyes as they realized the truth. That Madeline Crow was fucking stacked. And in this context, her classy, mature looks became even more impressive. Her piercing eyes. Her plump lips. And almost no wrinkles. Just seeing her face, you would view her as a beautiful, mature woman. But now, seeing her body, there was no other way to think of her other than a gorgeous, hot-bodied, sexy older woman. 

"Now, you see why I had intimidated the church. I suppose I can't blame them. My body is built for sin." Madeline said. 

"What are you doing? Why are you naked?" Alex asked. But Madeline didn't reply. She was looking at Sally. She was such a smart girl. She knew what was about to happen. She was starting to suspect what Madeline had planned. 

"Sally knows." Madeline replied. "Don't you?" 

"You can't do this! This isn't right!" Sally said. 

"What?" Alex asked. Madeline turned to face him. 

"Alex..." she began, walking toward him, her huge breasts jiggling. "Tonight, I'm taking you for my own needs. Tonight is the night you unleash me upon the world. Tonight is the night you and I become lovers." 

"You're kidding me?" Alex said, incredulously. 

"Why would he want to do it with you?" Sally asked snottily. At this point, she figured there was no point in being polite. At this point, despite the ridiculousness of the situation, being confronted by a 300-year-old, hot bodied witch who was trying to seduce her boyfriend in a haunted house, at its core this was really no different than if the school slut was trying to steal Alex from her. Pleasantries were useless. The claws had to come out. 

"Just look at me, dear. That's all the answer you need." Madeline said, opening her arms, showing off her lush form to Sally. Sally gritted her teeth. Even though this old woman was evil, and a witch, and a nut, Sally had to admit her naked body was not one you wanted your boyfriend seeing. 

"You're just an evil old lady. Alex is a good guy. He would never be interested in an old skank like you!" Sally called out. 

"Is that right?" Madeline said, raising one of her thin eyebrows. Madeline turned to face Alex. Sally looked over at him as the old witch turned, and she couldn't help but notice his eyes flick upward. It wasn't possible that he was checking out this old lady's butt... no, not possible. 

Madeline approached Alex's seated form. 

"This is what you want, isn't it Alex?" Madeline asked, her large breasts quivering with each step. "I know it is. It has been foretold. I know you and I are destined to be together. Meant to be lovers. Fated to be mates. Not only will your heart lie with me tonight, but your body will as well." 

Alex was still forced to be seated by Timmy, but he tried backing away from the approaching witch. 

"Tonight is a night for furious breeding. And your girlfriend will bear witness to our inevitable copulation. So accept your place, and by the end of the night, you will have taken part of a sacred rite: the conception of a child." Madeline offered. 

Alex gulped as she got closer. This crazed older woman was offering to have a child with him. This was crazy! Madness! He was only 18. He wasn't ready to have a kid, especially with this crazy old witch who had captured him and his girlfriend. Madeline approached and as she got close, he felt Timmy's grip on his shoulder's lessen. Alex didn't think. He acted. 

Quick as a flash, Alex grabbed Timmy's wrist and tossed him forward, his head smacking into the heavy cauldron. Finally free, Alex got to his feet. Tony stepped from behind Sally and ran towards Alex. Madeline stepped back and gestured towards Sally. Suddenly, Sally's hands and legs were stuck to the chair, as if glued on. She couldn't move! 

Tony ran forward and took a swing at Alex. Alex ducked under the punch and kneed Tony in the gut, knocking him to the floor. Dom got up and approached his best friend, completely naked. Dom smiled evilly and jumped at Alex. Reacting fast, Alex punched in front of him, connecting with Dom's jaw, knocking him to the ground. 

As Dom fell to the floor, his falling body revealed Nadine, standing nude behind her recent fuck partner. 

"Hello, Alex." she purred. "Do you like my body?" 

"What? Nadine! What are you doing?" Alex asked. 

"I'm just giving you a peek of what you always wanted to see." she began, approaching him calmly, her eyes glowing red. "I've seen you eyeing me up. No one would blame you. My body is hotter than Sally's. And besides, all guys want to fuck their girlfriend's hotter best friend." 

"No." Alex said quietly. He had three large guys on the floor, but it was Nadine that had him frozen. He couldn't help but notice her large breasts jiggle with each step. He couldn't help but notice her firm body and exposed pussy, on display for him, her best friend's boyfriend. 

Alex was frozen momentarily, but that was all that was needed. As he stepped back from Nadine, he felt a hand dig into his scalp. He opened his mouth in surprise as he felt his head being guided. As he turned to look back at who had a hold of him, Madeline used her grip on Alex to force his head against her breast, forcing her hard nipple into his open mouth. 

Alex was stunned. One second, he was fighting for his freedom from this woman, the next he had her nipple forced into his mouth. He obviously didn't want this and tried to pull away, but somehow the strong young man was unable to break the witch's grip. He couldn't pull away. Alex's face was being smothered in the soft flesh of Madeline Crow's breast. And there was seemingly nothing he could do about it. 

He tried to close his mouth, but Madeline had stuffed as much nipple into his mouth as she could, rendering his efforts useless. He had no choice but to take the cap of her giant breast into his mouth. Her hard nipple scraped against his tongue, aching for pleasure. Madeline gripped his head roughly, holding him in place. With her other hand, she reached up to cup her swollen breast. As soon as she cupped her giant tit, she gave it a firm squeeze, forcing milk to squirt from her hard nipple into his open mouth. 

Alex felt liquid squirt into his mouth, and still unable to pull away, he had no choice but to swallow the sweet fluid, barely registering it was milk. Madeline squeezed her swollen, spongy, swollen-to-the-brim with-milk breast, filling his mouth with her mother's milk. 

Alex didn't realize that he wasn't fighting quite as hard to pull away. He was being force fed milk from Madeline's giant breast, and he couldn't do anything to stop it. And this unholy tableau of sex was taking in place directly in front of Sally. 

Madeline maintained her firm grip on Alex, forcing him to drink her milk. As she did, she looked down at Sally and raised an eyebrow pointedly, as if she believed she was proving her point to be correct. That Alex and her were meant to be lovers. Madeline showed off, pointing her breasts outward, making them look even bigger on her slim frame as the young man's mouth stayed attached to her hard nipple. 

"Aaaahhh, that's it! Take my milk!" Madeline groaned out loudly, closing her eyes. 

It was sweet, agonizing bliss for Madeline. Her breasts had been eternally swollen with milk since her capture. She had been producing milk for her second child at the time, and when she found the spell to escape death and maintain her youth for hundreds of years, her body at that point was frozen in place, meaning her breasts had been filled to the max with milk since her capture, perpetually full, no matter what she did, without a mouth to take her milk. So, as the young man took her nipple and she could literally feel the milk being drain from her swollen udder, she shuddered in a long awaited bliss. She knew the relief would be temporary, as her jugs always refilled quickly, but the pleasure of having her tits drained was worth the wait. 

She opened her eyes and looked down at young man attached to her tit. She smiled down at him, knowing that despite his earlier pleas, he was enjoying this. Probably due that there was nothing quite like sucking on a massive breast. And also, Madeline knew her breast-milk was something special.  

===

Madeline had said that she wouldn't use any of her magic against the young man to get him on her side, but that wasn't entirely true. Sure, she wouldn't just put him under a spell like she did the others. But, that didn't mean she couldn't grease the wheels a bit. Madeline knew her breast milk could be quite addictive. She knew that one taste could drive a man wild with lust and dark thoughts. So although at first it was simply Madeline forcing her milk upon him, she could now feel his mouth lightly sucking at her nipple. 

Alex couldn't explain it. He shouldn't be in any way enjoying this. He was being forced into this! He shouldn't take any pleasure in this, this was just so, so wrong. But God her milk tasted good. As soon as it hit his tongue, he felt like a man dying of thirst being given a drop of water. He had to have more. So, despite this predicament, he found himself not fighting back as strongly. He found his hands resting on her full hips. He was letting her fill his mouth with the sweet substance. And once the pressure of the milk within her full breast was lessened, and the flow of milk slowed a bit, Alex couldn't stop himself from sucking ever so lightly as to help pull more milk into his mouth. He pressed himself into her just a bit and made sure his mouth completely surrounded her nipple, making sure none of the precious fluid escaped his mouth. And he let his tongue circle around her nipple, soaking it with his spit, cause that probably made the milk come out easier, right? And he found himself biting lightly at the rubber nipple, making her moan in satisfaction, cause making her moan probably made her milk really flow. 

"Ohhhh, that's it!" Madeline moaned out. She turned to look at Sally. "Your boyfriend is really enjoying this." 

"Bullshit!" Sally replied, "You're making him do this!" 

Madeline smiled and removed her hand from the back of his head, essentially freeing him from his soft prison. Sally waited to see her boyfriend pull away from the crazy witch, but she was shocked when he did not pull away. He didn't move. His mouth stayed firmly attached to the nipple. Sally looked closely, and only then did she notice his cheeks hollowed as he fervently sucked at Madeline Crow's nipple. 

And he was sucking away. Alex's mind was being clouded, and all he could think about was the soft breast in front of him. All he could think about doing was sucking on Madeline's breast and swallowing all of her milk. So now, he was aggressively sucking on Madeline's giant breast, hard, trying to inhale the milk she was producing. It was just so good! He couldn't stop himself. He would happily drown in the sweet fluid. 

He felt the flow of her milk slowing down. Sally watched as Alex let his hands run up Madeline's sides and before she bat an eye, he slid his hands up and cupped both of her massive breasts. 

"Alex?" Sally called out, but he couldn't hear her. He was too busy squeezing the witch's breasts hard, enveloping his hands in softness while trying to draw the rest of the milk out. Madeline's other bared breast was bursting with milk as Alex squeezed it, coating his palm. 

"Switch breasts, baby. It needs your mouth." Madeline whispered to the young man. 

"So good!" Alex grunted as he popped his mouth off her wet nipple, his mouth and her swollen nipple connected by strands of saliva and milk. Quick as a flash, he dove for her other breast, so swollen with her milk, so aching for his mouth. 

Alex was now brazenly squeezing at the older woman's rack, lost to the world. Sally could only watch in silence. She was in shock. Her boyfriend wouldn't do this to her. Madeline, this bitch, was doing something to him. 

"You bitch!" Sally screamed out, sensing that Madeline might have succeeded in tricking her boyfriend into letting this go way farther than it should. "You fucking bitch!" 

Madeline turned and stepped back towards her bed. Alex followed, unable to stop feeding on her prodigious rack. Over Alex's shoulder, Madeline looked at Sally smugly, sensing victory was soon at hand. She guided the young man till his back was facing the bed. Cradling his head, she forced him back onto the bed, keeping her nipple in his sucking mouth. She forced him back till his head hit the bed. Under his head, was the soft cushioning of the bed. And smothering his face, the softness of Madeline's massive breast. His mouth kept sucking at her breast, swallowing her milk, letting her do whatever she wanted. And she was about to take advantage of that. 

Sally watched as the crazed woman leaned over her boyfriend's face, her massive udders hanging over his face, one of her nipples jammed in his mouth. Madeline swiveled so she could look at Sally and continue her seduction. 

"Stop! Alex! Snap out of it! She's using her magic on you!" Sally called out. 

"Afraid not." Madeline replied. "I think he just really likes me." 

"Bullshit!" Sally called out. "You're a witch! An old lady! Why would he like you?" 

"You think he isn't in love with me?" Madeline asked. Smiling smugly, she ran her hand down Alex's fit belly. Meeting Sally's gaze, Madeline slid her hand under Alex's jeans, snaking her hand around his dick. "Oh... what's this?" she asked. 

With a flick of her fingers, Alex's pants flew down to his ankles as if being forcefully pulled down, exposing his lower half. Sally was now confronted with the sight of this crazy, old witch with her fingers snaked around her boyfriend's cock. Sally's secret prize on her perfect boyfriend. Sally's favorite toy. Alex's throbbing, pulsing, dripping nine-inch shaft, now in the hands of this ungodly witch. 

"You think you understand him, but apparently, you do not." Madeline stated. "It looks like I know your boyfriend more than you do. I know what he truly wants. Truly needs." 

Madeline bent over, bringing her mouth to his ear. "Let me give you something even better to taste." She whispered. With that, she pulled her nipple from his mouth with a pop, getting up on her knees. Alex was dazed under her, allowing Madeline to straddle his face without a bit of fight. Smiling at Sally from across the room, she bent over and pointed Alex's huge dick at her face. Opening her mouth, she lowered her head. 

"NO!" Sally called out, but there was no stopping this. 

Madeline opened her lips wide and allowed Alex's throbbing dick into her open mouth. Looking up at Sally, she closed her lips around Alex's thick shaft, her plump lips wrapped around the young's man massive meat. 

Her mouth was like velvet, enveloping the young man's beefy dick in softness. She dove in, practically swallowing his large meat. Her plump lips were stretched around the pulsing shaft, and as she choked on his dick, her lips reached the root of his cock, feeling the pulses of pleasure running through him. 

Alex grunted in pleasure. He was still in a haze from her magic milk, so he wasn't thinking clearly. All he knew was that there was a hot, wet, tight mouth smothering his cock in pleasure, deep-throating him, and at that moment, nothing could stop him from enjoying the pleasure. Even though the woman bringing him that pleasure was an over 300-year old witch, in a body that stopped aging in her forties, a witch who had attacked him, his girlfriend, and his friends. A witch who had enslaved his friends, captured and used them for her twisted plans. A woman who trapped his girlfriend to a chair and forced her to watch as she took advantage of her boyfriend. A woman who proudly advertised her status as an evil witch and intended to get revenge on society for her years of capture. None of that mattered. What did matter was the following: her breasts were huge, and the milk she produced was quite nearly the tastiest liquid he had ever drank. And her mouth just inhaled his dick in just the right way, swallowing it to the root, her tongue laving his shaft in firm licks, her saliva soaking his cock, her throat trying to coax the cum from his balls. 

It didn't matter to Alex at that moment that this woman had attacked his friends. She could suck dick like she was built for it, sucking far more deeply and sensuously than Sally ever did. Sally was always energetic but tentative when sucking his dick. She wanted to bring him pleasure, but she was not able to handle his larger than average size. But Madeline clearly was, and despite his altered state, he noted this. Despite his image as a perfect boyfriend, there was some still some things he craved that Sally wasn't giving him. Like, a full-on, knob to root blowjob, like what Madeline could give him. 

His back arched off the bed as Madeline sucked on his shaft hard, making him wince in pleasure. He grunted out loud, loud enough for Sally to hear his pleasure. And as he did, a drop of nectar from Madeline's dripping, mature cunt hit his tongue. And although he found her breast-milk nearly addictingly good, he wasn't ready for her cunt juices. Her juices hit his tongue and it was like a shock to his system. The juice was like a catalyst, inciting a jolt of energy to hit Alex, jerking his body shockingly. But Madeline was unaffected, attacking his dick from the tip to the balls like a wild woman, sucking on his dick ferociously, her black hair falling on his things as she made his cock throb. As Alex began to jerk around, Madeline simply lowered her lower half, forcing her cunt to consume his vision, his mind, and his soul. 

Alex's eyes flew open as the scent of her cunt hit his nose. He had a taste, and almost as if his body demanded more, he couldn't stop himself from diving upward, mouth open, surrounding her cunt with his mouth. 

Sally watched as her loving boyfriend and this crazy witch fell into a deep, wet 69 with each other. She watched as Madeline choked on her boyfriend's dick. She watched the line of spit get past her lips and soak Alex's heavy balls. She watched Madeline cup his balls and play with them lightly like a good slut would. And even though her view of Alex was obstructed, she noticed sadly that her boyfriend was diving into Madeline's cunt. 

Alex was baffled. Madeline's cunt tasted incredible! Her juices tasted amazing! His tongue was already tired as he ferociously attacked her mature pussy with his eager tongue. His tongue dove into her cunt, lapping her pussy walls, desperate to gather as much of her magical juices as he could. They tasted so good, and fogged his mind in the same wonderful way her milk did. He lightly nibbled at her clit, for no other purpose than to pleasure the deranged slut on top of him. Alex scrubbed his face against her cunt, wanting her juices to coat him, wanting that smell to cover his face. 

Sally watched Madeline as she sucked off Alex, and she had to admit that Madeline knew what she was doing. Her lips formed a tight seal around his shaft, allowing her to really hollow her cheeks, as if trying to suck the cum out from deep in his large, reluctant balls. Cause no matter what Madeline was doing to him, Sally knew Alex didn't really want this. He didn't want to enjoy this. He didn't want to give that crazy slut his cum. Sally clung to that belief. 

Alex had to cum. He was right on the edge of cumming down this witch's throat, but she knew just the right way to keep him on edge. He tried to dive into her cunt harder with his tongue, hoping he could convince her to take him over the edge. But nothing could bend her will. She didn't want him to cum. At least not yet. 

Finally, she popped her mouth from his thick shaft, her spit literally covering it, bands of saliva and pre-cum connecting her mouth to it, as if trying to pull them back together. She ground her cunt against his mouth roughly before pulling herself away. She rotated on the bed, straddling his crotch, ready to make their inevitable love official. She knew the effect her breast-milk and cunt-juice could have on a man, and she also knew those effects were unfortunately momentary. She knew she had to move this along. She knew she needed his fat cock in her tight cunt when the fog in his mind lifted, and when it lifted, and with a clear mind he experienced what her pussy could do, he would be hers for good. 

"Are you ready for this, dear?" Madeline asked Sally as the girl watched the older woman straddle her boyfriend and readied herself to fuck him. She grabbed his cock and held it against her pussy, drawing out the moment. "Are you ready to watch your boyfriend fuck me! Are you ready to watch your boyfriend fuck the shit out of my tight cunt and fill me up with his cum! Are you ready to watch your boyfriend's final betrayal?" 

Madeline's eyes around the city had seen a lot, and so she was able to adapt her dirty talk to keep up with the times, and now, she could keep up with the best of sluts everywhere. 

"Alex! Wake up! Do something!" Sally begged. But the witch had done something to him. He looked dazed, almost drugged, his lips swollen and soaked with the witch's evil juices. She knew he wasn't in the right mind to stop this. And she was right, because Madeline quickly force herself down, slowly forcing Alex's huge dick into her tight, mature cunt. 

Sally was forced to watch as the wide, round tip of her boyfriend's dick entered the confines of this evil woman's tight pussy, splaying her puffy lips apart until his thick cock sunk into her welcoming hole. 

"Aaaaahh!" Alex grunted out. 

"AWWW FUCK! FINALLY!" Madeline moaned as she sunk onto Alex's huge dick, ready to have the long elusive orgasm she had needed since her imprisonment. Over 300 years of sexual desire, built up, bottled up till this slut was ready to burst with lust. And all that energy was about to be focused on the young man beneath her. 

He didn't stand a chance. 

Alex's balls pressed against Madeline's ass as she buried the entire shaft inside her. She gasped softly as she felt his sack against her ass, knowing she took the entirety of the young man's huge dick in her tight cunt. 

For a few moments, she just sat in place, adjusting to the young man's size. She had never been with a man that large. They didn't make them this big back in her day. She swiveled her hips, gently moving around the pole inside her, soaking it with her dripping juices, letting it marinate. 

Her pussy had some magical qualities as well. Her cunt and her juices could drive a man wild, and any cock inside her seemed to suddenly get filled to bursting with cum, more cum than the man knew what to do with it. Cum that needed to go somewhere, specifically, the warmest, tightest hole he could find. Whether this effect was due to her magical abilities or her tighter than tight cunt didn't matter. All that mattered was that once inside her, there was no escape, and there would be none for Alex. Now that he was inside her, he would have to cum. And that, in the end, was the whole point. 

So, even though the effects of her addicting milk and cunt-juices were wearing off, the effects of her tight cunt were just taking shape. While the young man's head would soon be clear of her magical juices, his balls would soon be full of cum. So any decisions he made from that point on would be made with his dick, not his head. 

Just what Madeline wanted. 

With a few flicks of her fingers, Alex's pants flew off his ankles and his shirt flew upward and off, leaving the young man nude below her. She reached down and scratched his pecs lovingly... almost intimately. She still only slightly rotated her hips, waiting for the young man to come to. Sally watched this woman's perfect, pale, mature ass swiveling and flexing. Sally watched the witch's cunt spread around her boyfriend's thick cock. She watched as the witch looked back at her smugly, as if knowing victory was at hand. 

Madeline looked down at Alex. She could practically see the fog lift from his eyes, until he realized where he was. He realized he was on a bed, in the basement of a haunted house, in the lair of a deranged witch, surrounded by his enslaved friends, and his captured girlfriend, and a naked, voluptuous, sexy, evil witch on top of him, as naked as he was. Her huge tits hanging down. And he was balls deep inside her. 

What was he doing? What possessed him to do what he had done? Why had he sucked those massive, fleshy tits? Why had he swallowed her tantalizing milk? Why had he allowed her to suck him off? Why had he so eagerly swallowed her delicious pussy juices? 

Alex looked over at Sally, and saw the hurt on her face, and his heart dropped. What had he done? He had betrayed his girlfriend! He didn't mean to! He didn't want to, but she did something to him! That had to be it. He had been entranced by her somehow. He had to get away! He had to let Sally know what had happened. 

"No!" Alex called out. He raised his hands to fight off the older woman. But she was quick. She grabbed his wrists to deflect his attempts at freedom. Sally's heart rose at this, seeing her boyfriend had not been completely enchanted. Alex was strong. He tried to push Madeline off of him, but she was able to maintain her grip and keep his hands off of her. 

"Sally!" he called out, still wrestling with the witch. "She did something to me!" 

"I know, baby, I know!" Sally said, relieved. Her boyfriend's love was too strong for Madeline. The only chance she had was to use magic on him, and even then, the effects seemed to be temporary. Their love was winning out. 

But then Madeline slapped Alex's hands onto her boobs. 

All that fight, all that desire to escape seemed to just... fade away. For the first time, Alex had Madeline's huge boobs in his hands with a clear head. Now, there was nothing to stop him from admiring them. Admiring their softness. Their massive size. Their round shape. Their incredible firmness. Her deep, deep cleavage. The way her hard nipples dug into his palms. The way milk would leak out under even the slightest pressure. So basically, all things considered, they had everything a man could ask for. 

Madeline took advantage of this sudden change. She squeezed his palms, forcing him to squeeze her tits and really embracing their size and softness. He had quickly gone from fighting her to feeling her up. 

"It's okay." Madeline said softly, "Just feel my great, big breasts. You don't need to fight this. You need to embrace this." 

For a few seconds, Alex was again entranced by her. He hated and despised this evil woman, but her breasts were just huge. He had never seen breasts so big, let alone felt any. He had never felt anything so soft, so firm, so fleshy and big. They were so big it felt like they could swallow him up in softness. The warm breast milk dripped down his palms, making her flesh wet and smooth. He hated this woman, but God what he wouldn't give to lick that milk off her tits. That delicious milk... 

He shook his head and tried to pull away from her. And although his grip on her tits was temporarily gone, she gave him a squeeze with her cunt to remind him that she still had a very tight grip on him. 

So lost was Alex in Madeline's prodigious rack he had forgotten he was balls deep in this bitch. Her tight, squeezing mature cunt was gripping his young, thick, pulsing cock. And although Alex was disgusted by this woman's evil, manipulative ways, her cunt was driving him fucking wild. The way it squeezed him tighter than any pussy he had ever felt, even Sally's. Alex couldn't believe this old, colonial, deranged witch had such a tight, wet, vice-like hole. His cock was tingling, the cum set to burst forth, ready to explode from his ready ball sack. 

How could he both detest this woman and enjoy her cunt? How could he be attracted to her and also disgusted by her evilness? How could he love his girlfriend and also be under this woman with his cock buried inside her extra- tight cunt? How could he both hate this woman and be so close to cumming inside of her? This woman had his mind split in two.  

===

"Listen dear..." Madeline began, leaning forward, forcing her breasts into his still outstretched palms, filling his manly hands up again. "I could make you cum at any point, and my plan would probably work. But I haven't waited 300 years for probably. For this to work, I need not only your cum... I need your heart. I need your loyalty. And I will get it, whether you want it or not. By the end of this night, you will belong to me." 

Alex was in conflict. Her cunt had him so on edge that he could barely move without cumming inside her and filling her cunt with what felt like the biggest wad of cum he ever shot. He tried to pull his hands from her rack, but he had little room to maneuver, and his hands had minds of their own. Despite hating this woman, he loved squeezing her huge, soft tits. He couldn't stop himself. He was so on edge by the never-ending squeezing and tightening of her silky cunt that he couldn't control himself. Madeline looked over her shoulder. 

"Look at me Sally!" Madeline called out, looking at the scared girl. She was confused about her boyfriend and terrified on many levels by what Madeline was doing. Madeline was destroying her world. "Sally!" Madeline said more firmly, getting the scared girls attention. Sally looked up at the witch. 

"I want you to look at me." Madeline purred. "Look at my ass! Look at how firm it is. How round and juicy it is. And look at your boyfriend's cock. Look where your boyfriend's cock goes inside my cunt. Look at how wet it is. Look how swollen it is. Look how it's throbbing with need. Look at how much my pussy is stretching around it. Imagine how good my cunt must feel. Imagine what your boyfriend must be feeling. My tight cunt... my hot body... my huge tits... any normal man would have cum by now. Even Alex. But, I put a bit of a spell on his cock and balls. He can't cum until he has permission... from you." 

"What?" Sally asked, beyond confused. 

"I've been waiting 300 years for one good orgasm. And I'm going to get it. I'm going to fuck your boyfriend until he can't take it anymore. Until he is begging for it. Until the sweet pain is too much to bear. He will need to cum, but he will not be able to until you tell him it's okay. He can molest my hot body, put his hands all over me, and it won't be enough. He needs you. He needs your permission. He will need you to ease his pain. He will need you to be complicit in your own downfall, complicit in your boyfriend's betrayal. That is the only way he can cum. Got it?" Madeline said. 

"What?" Sally repeated. 

"Sally, don't do it! I can take it! I love you!" Alex pled while using Madeline's squishy breasts to relieve his stress. 

Madeline laughed to herself. 

"That's good, because I have a lot of orgasms I need to get out of my system, and your dick is clearly big enough for the job." Madeline said, turning to face him. Alex swallowed deep. He knew he was in for something he was unsure if he was ready for. 

He had no idea. 

Smiling arrogantly, Madeline dug into his chest with her nails as he dug into hers. She slowly lifted herself, exposing Alex's soaked dick to the air once more. Madeline had been right. It was literally pulsing with need. 

"Ugh!" Madeline grunted out, driving her hips into him. She repeated this motion, up and down, up and down, up and down. While it was an effort to drive his thick shaft into her small, tight pussy, as his dick became more soaked with her cunt-juices, the journey became easier. Madeline sped up till her ass was slamming into his thighs loudly. 

"Uh, UGH, you like that baby!?" Madeline said, cackling as she rode the young man like she was riding a bull. 

"No... NO! I don't!" Alex gasped desperately, gripping her breasts, easing his pain by squeezing their softness. And as he did, milk squirted from her nipples, soaking his hands and chest. 

"You want to feed again, my love?" Madeline asked, not losing her focus as she fucked his cock roughly into submission. The pleasure he felt was so great his cock was almost numb. There was too much sensation for any one man to deal with. He could barely move. His eyes were closed to blind himself from the feelings of bliss, and his mouth was gaping open in pained pleasure. 

Madeline swept his hands from her tits and leaned forward till her udders hung over the young man. Reaching up with one hand, she squeezed one massive breast, milk firing from her hard nipple, crossing the gap and into his open mouth. Madeline watched the milk pool there for a moment before the milk hit his tongue and he realized what was there. He swallowed quickly as the milk kept coming. Unconsciously, his mouth leapt forward and reattached to her hard nipple. 

"There you go, Alex. Feed." Madeline cooed, as the young man fed himself on her mother's milk. "You know how good that milk makes you feel. You know how badly it fills you with desire. You know that milk makes you just want to explode." she whispered. 

Sally watched this intimate looking conversation from afar. This was torture. This witch was torturing her boyfriend with pleasure. He could barely move. She was forcing himself on him, and he was in too much pleasure to stop her. Alex was furiously sucking on the older woman's breast, finding a small comfort in the storm. Both of the two lovers were working up a sweat as Madeline never stopped bouncing. 

Sally watched her boyfriend's swollen cock go in and out of this deranged woman's cunt. Her boyfriend didn't want this, but his body was being deceived. Used and abused by this evil woman. She couldn't be mad at him. This was Madeline's fault. She was doing this. 

"You bitch!" Sally called out, "You evil bitch! I can't believe I ever believed in you!" 

She looked around at her friends, hoping for help. But Tony and Timmy were simply looking at Madeline lustfully. On the other side of the room, Dom was spooned up behind Nadine, sucking at her neck as Nadine looked at the scene before her with an evil glint in her eye. 

"Oh Madeline! Your body is so hot! I'm gonna cum!" Nadine squealed, cumming on Dom's cock. 

There was no help to be found for Sally. 

"I'm not so bad, Sally. I just want to bring your boyfriend pleasure. That's not so bad, right?" Madeline asked, smiling evilly. 

Madeline bounced on the young man's dick. Sweat was now dripping down their bodies. Madeline had her breast ballooning against his face, smothering him as he sucked away. His hands had fallen to her hips, gripping her lightly as she rode him. She ripped her nipple from his mouth. 

"Alex!" Sally called out, "Can you hear me? Are you okay?" 

Alex was grimacing in pain. His eyes were still closed, and his mouth was still open. 

"Alex! It's okay! Listen, I love you! We can get through this! We can escape!" Sally plead. The thwumping of Madeline and Alex's skin colliding echoed through the room. 

"Talk to your girlfriend, dear. Tell her what your feeling." Madeline commanded softly, hands on his chest as she bounced on his dick. 

"Sally..." Alex grunted out. 

"Alex!" Sally called to him. "This will be okay. We can get through this. 

"Sal, you don't understand... I can't." Alex said, his voice pained. 

"Alex, I love you! We can do this!" Sally replied. 

"OH FUCK, THAT COCK'S GOOD!" Madeline screamed out. 

"We?" Alex asked. 

"Yes, me and you. Together. We are stronger together." Sally said. "You can resist." 

"I LOVE IT! I LOVE THAT FAT COCK!" Madeline screamed. 

"Sal, I can't." Alex said. "I need to do it!" 

"What?" Sally said. 

"Sally, I need to cum!" Alex begged. 

"FUCKING SHIT FUCK!" Madeline squealed out, her mastery of modern dirty talk shining through. 

He was trying to resist, but the pleasure was overwhelming his mind. He couldn't think. He couldn't focus. The need in his balls was overwhelming rational thought. 

"Alex, stay strong!" Sally said. "You can get through this!" 

"I can't do it! I'm not strong enough!" Alex replied. Madeline kept bouncing, her huge, pale tits jiggling with each bounce and her juicy ass flexing. Madeline was gripping his cock with her cunt, driving him insane. Sally saw every bit of Madeline's body trying to coax the cum out from her boyfriend's balls. 

"Alex, you can't! I can't tell you to... I can't do that!" Sally begged. Suddenly, Madeline lifted herself from the young man, his soaked, swollen cock slapping against his belly once it left her cunt. Madeline spun and gripped his cock, stroking it furiously as she looked at Sally. 

"Look at it! Look at how swollen it is!" Madeline seethed out, looking insane with lust. She was right, Sally realized. Alex's dick had never looked that big. It looked like it had grown an inch since she last saw it. It was pulsing with his heartbeat, leaking pre-cum like a faucet. It was the type of cock a girl looks at and can just tell is brimming with cum, right on the edge of a huge explosion. "Do you even understand what he is going through? He needs this, Sally. He needs to cum! Don't you want your boyfriend to feel good? Don't you want him to be happy? To feel no pain at all?" 

Sally looked conflicted. She didn't want him to give another woman, this witch, his cum. But she didn't want her boyfriend to be struggling like this. Seeing her indecision, Madeline straddled Sally's boyfriend again, sitting on his cock until he was balls deep in her cunt again. Madeline shook her hair and grabbed Alex's wrists, slapping his hands on her boobs again. Alex immediately started squeezing them again. Madeline dug in and began to bounce again. 

"Ughh! UHHHH! FUCK!" Alex called out. He was squeezing Madeline's tits roughly, the milk squirting onto his hands and his chest, so both of them were now soaked in sweat and breast-milk. Alex's eyes opened wide and looked at Sally. 

"Sally! Please!" Alex begged, his eyes looking more intense than she had ever seen. Madeline's black hair hung down, dancing over the young man's neck. 

"I, I, I, I.... I can't!" Sally stammered. 

"C'mon Sally! Please!" Alex called out. Sally shook her head. She couldn't do it. 

"Fuck her, Alex! Fuck her hard!" Tony said. 

"Fuck that hot bitch! Make her cum!" Timmy added. 

Madeline smiled gleefully. This was going perfectly. She was so close to victory. And she knew that Alex's imminent betrayal would give her the biggest orgasm ever. 

"SAL! C'MON! I NEED IT!" Alex grunted. 

"No, Alex! Stay strong!" Sally begged. 

Alex started panicking. He was losing control. His sanity was slipping away. The only thing that was stable to him was Madeline. Her soft breasts, so good to the touch. They were just so massive and round and firm. He didn't care about Sally and his relationship. He didn't care that he was fucking an evil witch! He just had to fucking cum! Was that so much to ask!? 

"SALLY!" Alex called out, feeling himself slipping. 

"I can't!" Sally sobbed, tears streaming down her cheeks. 

Alex looked up at Madeline. Despite her age, and how evil and deranged she was, she was still just fucking gorgeous, and she was fucking him ferociously, like an animal. It didn't matter what she done to him and to his girlfriend and their friends. She was built to fuck, and she was bringing similar instincts out of him. He was losing interest in maintaining this loyalty bullshit. He just needed to drain his fucking balls. 

He looked up at Madeline as she roughly bounced on him. He saw her massive bouncing tits, so swollen and firm, leaking milk everywhere. He looked across her pale, creamy skin. So sexy. And he looked up at her gorgeous, mature face, her elegance hiding her true evil. 

He looked up at her and she looked down at him. A sexy, evil smirk crossed her lips. 

Alex snapped. 

Quick as a flash, Alex sat up and wrapped his arms around the older woman's waist. His firm, muscular chest pressed against her massive, robust breasts, sweat and milk mixing between the two. She ground her cunt around his dick as he sat up. 

Sally watched from her chair, still stuck in place, as her boyfriend's hands slid down to cup Madeline's ass-cheeks, squeezing her juicy ass lustfully as she ground herself against him. And as Sally looked at her boyfriend's face, time seemed to slow down. With an almost wolfish, evil smirk across his mouth, his face approached the witch on top of him. Slowly, their mouths parted. Tongues appeared from both of them as their mouths moved closer. And finally, as Alex and Madeline's lips met, as their tongues entered each others' mouths, Sally screamed out. 

"NOOO!" 

Sally watched the older woman's soft lips press against her boyfriends. She saw their mouths moving as they maneuvered their tongues, making this kiss deeper. This was wrong, Sally thought. This was too intimate. What was happening? 

Alex and Madeline fell to the bed in each others' arms as they rolled around, furiously making out. This older woman wrestled with her hunky boyfriend, sweat mixing. This looked less like forced sex and more like two completely willing participants. 

"Alex!" Sally called out, but there was no response. Alex rolled on top of Madeline and propped himself over her. Alex's strong, muscular back and bare ass were visible to Sally, as were his strong arms as he held himself over the old woman. She released her grip on him and spread her legs, so the only thing connecting them were their conjoined genitalia. Alex was completely free to escape. He could leave the bed and rescue Sally. He could save the day like the hero Sally knew he was. 

What would he do? 

Not even once looking back at his girlfriend, Alex lowered his hips, driving his large dick balls-deep inside the insane witch. 

"Alex!" Sally called out, now more worried than anything. What was he doing? Why wasn't he escaping? Why was he continuing this? Why was he still fucking her when he could escape? Alex didn't respond. Sally looked between his legs as he drove his rock-hard, throbbing prick into this sexy old-lady's evil cunt. It had never looked bigger. Sally could practically see the cum sloshing in his sack. 

Alex's hips rolled as he drove himself into her, never slowing down, his muscular frame moving smoothly and undulating like a serpent as he fucked her. 

"Alex! What's going on!?" Sally screamed. 

"LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO ME!" Alex roared, his voice harsh and strained. All eyes in the room were on Alex. The room was frozen except for him and Madeline. 

"What!?" Sally asked. 

"JUST LET ME FUCKING CUM!" Alex screamed out, not once slowing down in pleasuring the old bitch under him. 

"No! Alex... I can't!" Sally begged. 

"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!" Alex screamed out. He drove into Madeline harder. Madeline wrapped her arms around Alex's neck let her legs rise into the air, pointed towards the ceiling as the young man pounded her into oblivion. She was so close to cumming, but she was holding back. She knew if she held out just a bit more, then this cum might be something special. 

"I fucking love you." Alex said quietly, staring down at the deranged witch he was fucking. She smiled knowingly. If Sally would have just let him cum, it wouldn't have come to this. He wouldn't have had to willingly fuck this evil slut. This could have been done with, but she selfishly made him hold back, just to maintain a loyalty she should know they had. If this evil bitch made him cum, it wasn't his fault. It wasn't a betrayal. It would have been simply a physical reaction. This told Alex she wasn't so sure of his loyalty. That deep down, she was jealous and unsure of him. And that insecurity led him to this, this torture Sally was letting him take. She was selling him out for her own sake. 

But not Madeline. She had done nothing but bring him pleasure. Incredible, world-changing pleasure. And her hot fucking body was just so fucking sexy. 

Sally was the angel on his shoulder and Madeline was the devil on the other one. And it was becoming clear whose voice mattered to him more at this point. 

Alex dove down, his lips meeting Madeline's again. She ran her hands across his muscular back lovingly, tracing his taut muscles with her fingers. 

"Alex!" Sally called out, worried. What was he doing? "Alex!" she repeated. Alex picked up the pace, fucking the evil witch harder, his swollen balls slapping against her ass. Alex reached down and cupped one of Madeline's massive breasts, cupping it in his hand, squeezing it, bringing his mouth to it and again attacking it's rubbery cap, forcing more milk into his mouth. 

"ALEX! What are you doing?" Sally screamed out. Alex kept driving into the witch, Madeline's legs bouncing in the air as he drove into her. He pulled his mouth from her breast. 

"Let me fucking cum!" he growled at his girlfriend. 

"Alex?" Sally said, unsure. This wasn't sounding like him. 

"LET ME FUCKING CUM IN HER TIGHT FUCKING CUNT! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO FUCKING ASK?" Alex screamed at his girlfriend. 

Sally was in silence, taken aback. He had never yelled at her before today. He had never gotten angry. Seeing this part of him was scary. 

"Let him fucking cum! FUCK YES, I LOVE THAT DICK!" Madeline screamed. 

Sally started sobbing as her boyfriend and this evil old lady fucked the shit out of each other. Alex drove the thick dick that used to belong to Sally into Madeline, this crazy witch. Their sweaty bodies writhed together, his tight muscles against her creamy flesh. 

"Aww, FUCK!" Alex screamed out, Madeline's tight pussy driving him mad. 

"SHIT! I LOVE YOU!" Madeline told Sally's boyfriend. 

"I LOVE YOU TOO!" Alex groaned out. "UGHHH YES!" 

"Please stop!" Sally begged. But they didn't bother listening to her. She barely mattered to them. They were too engrossed in each other. Alex, her sweet loving boyfriend, was willingly pleasuring this insane woman. Somehow, someway, he had lost himself. This woman had changed him. In the act of sex, she had somehow spread her poisonous ways to her boyfriend. The longer this went on, the more he would be changed. There was only one way to stop this. 

"Alex... you can cum!" Sally cried out. Neither of the two lovers responded. Sally rolled her eyes sadly. "Alex! YOU CAN CUM! Cum inside her and end this!" Sally screamed out, giving permission to her boyfriend to betray her. 

"CUM, MY LOVE! CUM INSIDE MY CUNT! UGHHHNNN, FUUUCCCKK! CUM INSIDE ME! GET ME PREGNANT!" Madeline screamed. 

"HGNNNN! FUCK, MADELINE!" Alex screamed out, turning the corner, his balls boiling. He drove into her harder, the entire bed bouncing as they rutted. "FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK!" Alex grunted. 

"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH! FUCCCKKKKKK!" Madeline screamed, her voice echoing through the Cursed House of Crow, her scream ringing in Sally's ears. 

Alex drove into her, burying himself completely in her unbelievably tight cunt. Sally watched as Alex's balls clenched. 

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Alex screamed, the pleasure too strong, nearly in tears as he reached his climax. 

Sally saw his balls tighten, and could practically see the cum firing from his balls and into Madeline's cunt. She saw Alex ass tightening as he drove himself into her, trying to force the cum inside her as deep as it would go. 

"AHHH! THAT'S IT! CUM INSIDE ME! BETRAY YOUR TRUE LOVE! GIVE ME YOUR CHILD! MAKE ME CUM!" Madeline moaned out. Her body quivered as she came, grinding against Sally's boyfriend as they rode out their violent orgasms. This went on for what seemed like forever, their bodies grinding against each other, drawing out their combined pleasure. Making sure his cock was completely buried within the older woman's tight grasping cunt, making sure his seed got as deep within her as possible. Sally watched her boyfriend's dick, watching it swell and clench, watching it pumping his seed into the 300 year old witch. Sally watched in shock as her boyfriend just kept cumming. He couldn't stop himself. His cock was like a firehouse, firing cum everywhere. Luckily, his cock was inside a pussy, so instead of making a huge mess, he simply filled Madeline's sweet cunt with hot cum. Sally was disturbed to see cum leaking from the deranged witch's cunt, showing that her boyfriend had completely filled her up to the brim.  

===

Finally, they both relaxed, collapsing against each other, gathering their strength and clearing their heads. Both moved only slightly as they came back to reality. Sally watched her boyfriend, hoping that now since his balls were empty, he could now understand what he did and remember his love and loyalty for his girlfriend and stop this evil bitch once and for all. 

Alex rolled off of Madeline and laid next to her, as both tried to regain their strength. Both were still covered with sweat, but both his chest and Madeline's mountainous peaks were covered with her milk. And Alex's dick, even though drained of cum, was still swollen and semi-hard. But Sally knew there was no way he would be up for more action after what she just saw. It would take a while for him to recover. 

"Alex?" Sally called out tentatively, unsure of what he would say. But it was Madeline who responded, rolling off the bed, getting off her feet and walking towards Sally. 

"Sally, don't you understand? Your boyfriend and I are lovers now. He gave me his seed, his heart and his soul. He belongs to me now. You gave him to me. You allowed him to cum inside of me. You gave permission. I would have made him cum anyway, but I just wanted to hear you say it. Ha ha! Now, thanks to you, he's mine now." Madeline said. 

"Bullshit! Alex can speak for himself. You tricked him. You forced him into this!" Sally cried out. It was then that a pair of hands went around Madeline's waist, clearly Alex's strong, manly hands. For a second, Sally's heart rose, seeing her boyfriend about to fight back against this evil bitch. But then, Alex's big, strong hands reached up and cupped Madeline's massive breasts from behind, squeezing them firmly. Alex's face appeared over Madeline's shoulder, no trace of the sweet, articulate young man Sally loved. He looked like some, arrogant, sex-crazed asshole, some idiot jock who thought only with his dick. 

"Alex?" Sally called out tentatively. She watched as her boyfriend's hands squeezed Madeline's large rack, the milk squirting forth from her nipples onto Sally's jeans. 

"You ready for round two?" Madeline whispered to her young lover as he nuzzled her lips with his mouth. 

"I don't think I can get enough of this body." Alex whispered hotly. He pressed himself against her, his belly against her back, his cock wedged between her ass cheeks. 

"Mmmm, I know it, dear." Madeline replied. "But what about your girlfriend? She'll see everything, again." 

"If she doesn't care about me, then I don't care about her." Alex whispered again. 

"What? Alex! I love you!" Sally cried out. 

"It was you who tortured him. Put him through that ordeal!" Madeline began. "Your selfish loyalty caused him pain. Your weak mind underestimated him. Your soft heart broke his, and made him fall for me instead. I have claimed him as my own now, thanks to you. You were complicit in your boyfriend leaving you, and his betrayal of you is what made me cum. His betrayal made him mine, and will allow me to escape." 

"Alex!" Sally called out, desperate to see any part of him she recognized. 

"We could leave now..." Madeline offered to Alex. "Or, you can fuck my ass in front of your girlfriend and betray her some more? It's up to you." 

This set Alex off. He attacked her neck savagely with his mouth, sucking on it, licking her soft skin. Alex dragged her back and forced her onto the bed. She got on all fours, her ass pointed at Sally. 

"Alex! Don't do this! We can escape! We can get out of here!" Sally pleaded. Alex glanced back at Sally, a dark glare across his face as he looked at her, followed by an evil smile. Sally didn't recognize him. Madeline had changed him. Transformed him. Corrupted him. Tainted him with her evil ways. He wasn't Sally's anymore. He was Madeline's now. 

With a cocky swagger, Alex joined Madeline on the bed. Madeline's ass-cheeks spread naturally in her position, showcasing her tasty looking asshole to the young man. Without hesitation, and as if knowing what how this act worked, he got behind Madeline, used his hands to spread her cheeks, and worshipfully ran his tongue up along Madeline's ass crack. 

"No!" Sally called out as she watched her boyfriend's tongue run across this evil woman's asshole. The same tongue that had been in her mouth, on her breasts, against her vagina, was now furiously rimming the asshole of this crazy, evil witch. Alex palmed her ass-cheeks as he soaked this older woman's asshole with his saliva, showing no hesitation in performing this sinful act. 

"Oh! That's it! Lick my asshole! Stick your tongue inside! Please!" Madeline begged. Sally watched her boyfriend point his tongue and stab at the older woman's ass, desperate to get his tongue inside of her. "UHH! Harder!" Madeline seethed. "Do it! Force it in! Harder! Harder! Harder! HARDER! HARDER! HARDER! FUCK YES!" Madeline squealed. Sally watched as her boyfriend's tongue broke through, entering this older woman's asshole. 

"Suck my ass, boy! Suck it! Suck it hard! DO IT! FUCCCCCKKKKK!" Madeline squealed as the young man closed his lips around her asshole and sucked at her, circling his tongue against her tight asshole, wetting it with his saliva. 

Sally couldn't believe what she was seeing. Part of her was wondering if she was the one who had lost it. What she saw didn't make sense. Her boyfriend was sucking the asshole of an insane witch, and he was loving it! He had fucked her once, and was about to fuck her again... up the ass! 

This went on and on, Sally's boyfriend's face planted between the firm cheeks of Madeline's ass, sucking and rimming her. Sally was silent. Her words couldn't stop him anymore. 

Alex pulled away from Madeline's ass and moved up behind her, slapping his now hard dick against her ass-crack. Alex reached down and moved himself into place, his cock poised against this older woman's asshole. 

"Do it!" Madeline spat out. "Fuck me! Fuck my ass!" 

Grabbing her hips, Alex pulled her back as he pushed forward, flexing his hips, until finally, the older woman's asshole gave way, allowing his thick shaft to enter. Alex pushed himself forward, forcing more of his cock into Madeline's asshole. 

"AHHHH! That's it! Take my ass! Make it yours!" Madeline grunted out. Alex looked down at Madeline's asshole, stretched to the brim around his shaft as he forced more of his meat inside of her. He kept pushing his cock into her, her asshole shockingly accepting every inch of his thick shaft until her asshole was wrapped around the root of his dick and his hips met her ass. 

"Fuck my ass, boy! FUCK ME!" Madeline screamed. Alex reached forward and grabbed the witch's long, black hair, pulling her head back as he pulled his hips back. Removing everything but the tip from her asshole, Alex pulled back on Madeline's hair, driving his cock back into her ass. 

"That's it!" Madeline screamed out. Alex began pumping in and out, driving his cock into the older woman's welcoming ass. Alex drove himself from knob to root inside of her tight ass, feeling her asshole gripping his shaft, smothering it with pleasure with each stroke. 

"Your ass is so fucking tight!" Alex cried out, smacking the older woman's juicy ass-cheek. 

"Mmmm, your supposedly loving girlfriend never gave you her ass, did she?" Madeline asked. 

"No! Of course not!" Alex grunted out. 

"Hmmm, denying you pleasure again. Oh fuck yes!" Madeline cried out smugly. 

Sally was silent. This wasn't her boyfriend anymore. He had been twisted and warped by this evil woman, so in her mind, none of his words were really him. But, as she looked around at her friends, all now watching the action avidly, she saw all their eyes shining red. But Alex's eyes were the same crystal blue. Whatever spell her friends were under, Alex wasn't. So deep down, she knew that every decision he made was not from any spell. The only spell he was under was the spell of the older woman's hot body. And this was what made Alex betray her. This made Sally's heart break. 

"Fuck her ass, Alex! Fuck it hard!" Nadine cheered on, as she curled up in Dom's arms and watched the action avidly. 

Alex kept fucking the witch doggy style, driving his thick meat into her tight asshole. He bent over her and reached down, pawing at her breasts, squeezing at them while driving into her. 

"Give it to me! Give me that fat cock! Fuck my ass harder! Spank it again!" Madeline cried. Alex slapped her round ass, causing the flesh to jiggle as he drove his thick prick into her as roughly as he could. Both of them were swaying and moving around as they fucked, the force of this fuck rougher than anything Sally had ever seen. This fuck would be too hard for most women, but not Madeline. 

"More! MORE! HARDER!" Madeline begged. Alex was more beast than man, fucking this older woman as hard as he fucking could. His hard dick slid in and out of the older woman's ass, pulsing with pleasure. Her ass was even tighter than her tight cunt, which was the tightest hole he had ever fucked, until now. This was tightness. This was what real sex was. Hard cocks and tiny, tight holes, eager to be stretched. Eager to be fucked as hard as possible. 

"AHHH, I'M GETTING CLOSE! MAKE MY ASS CUM! FUCK MY ASS TILL YOU MAKE ME CUM!" Madeline grunted out, her voice hoarse. 

"Fuck, your ass is so tight! I fucking love it!" Alex cried out. 

"Tell me you love it more than your girlfriend! Tell me you love me more than her! Tell me I have your heart now! Betray your girlfriend one last time! Then you can cum!" Madeline ordered. 

"Ughhh, I love it! I love your ass! I love your asshole more than my girlfriend! I love your tits more than I love her! I love every bit of you more than the best part of her! I love you, Madeline! I love you more than I love her!" Alex grunted. 

"AHHHH! FUCKKKKK! ALMOST THERE! MAKE ME CUM, LOVER! Fuck my ass and MAKE ME CUMMMM!" Madeline screamed. 

Alex was almost over the edge. He drove his thick cock into her. One stroke. Two. Three. 

"UGHHHHHH! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK! DAMMIT I'M FUCKING CUMMING! AHHHHHH!" Alex screamed out, burying his shaft to the root in the old witch's asshole, just in time as her hole tightened, setting him off, his cock exploding. 

"I'm GONNA CUMMMMM! FUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKKK!" Madeline screamed, pleasure overwhelming her as she felt the young man's cum beginning to fill her ass. 

The lovers grunted and flexed and jerked around as they came, losing control of their bodies during this sweet pleasure. Alex drove the older woman into the bed as they both came, waves of pleasure coursing through them as Alex filled her ass with cum. 

Sally again had to watch and see the disturbing sight of seeing her boyfriend's ass flex and his balls clench as he filled another woman with cum. She again watched him driving his thick cock into another woman and filling her with cum. 

Finally, the two lovers relaxed and Alex's sweaty body slid off of Madeline, falling to her side. He was quite nearly out of energy. Madeline was not. Madeline slid off the bed and got to her feet, her thighs coated with the cum leaking from her cunt, and the rest of her hot body covered with sweat and milk. Madeline faced Sally and walked slowly towards her. 

"Followers come forth!" Madeline called out. Tony and Timmy approached, as did Nadine and Dom, hand in hand. Alex was still on the bed, gathering his strength. 

"You guys! Wake up! Please! Help Me!" Sally begged, looking at her possessed friends, but they barely acknowledged her. They looked at Madeline adoringly, worshipfully. 

"It is time to finish the potion and complete my journey. My escape." Madeline declared. "I am ready for you each to make your donation." Madeline approached Tony and Timmy, who were standing next to each other. She reached forward and grabbed at the hands of both. Palms facing up, Madeline ran a finger across the hands and fingers of both. Finally, with a quick motion, she used her sharp nails to draw a drop of blood from each. She gathered these drops onto her fingernails, dripping them into the gurgling cauldron. 

"Blood of the followers, willingly offered." Madeline said to herself. She approached Nadine and Dom and ran her fingers across their foreheads. She gathered their sweat across her fingers and let it drip into the cauldron. 

"Sweat of the followers, eagerly exerted." Madeline said. Madeline leaned over the cauldron and let her breasts hang down over it. She reached up and squeezed her breasts, milk squirting again from her massive breasts and into the mixture. 

"Milk of the mother, happily given." she said to herself. Madeline turned to face Sally. She walked forward and approached the young girl. Madeline bent over and ran her fingers along Sally's cheek, gathering a tear on her finger. Madeline smiled and turned to go back to the cauldron, shaking her ass at the young girl, showing off its perfect shape and her boyfriend's cum leaking from it. 

"Tears of the innocent, uncontrollably sacrificed." Madeline said, letting the tears drop into the cauldron. She then reached down to her crotch and gathered some cum onto her fingers. She reached into her ass-crack and scooped some cum from there as well. 

"Seed of the betrayer, forcefully taken." she said. The potion lit up, glowing in orange light, as if letting them all know the potion was complete. 

"Ahh, cum, truly the most magical substance a man can provide." Madeline began, licking the remaining cum from her fingers. "One fluid, capable of saying so much. Making life. Cementing love. Breaking hearts. Love. Life. Heartbreak. Betrayal. One fluid, capable of so much, depending on how it's used. It's truly a wondrous thing. And it's quite tasty as well." 

Madeline hovered over the cauldron and used a large ladle to stir the mixture, the potion thick and heavy. Madeline used the ladle to scoop some of the potion out and poured it into a goblet. Setting down the ladle, the nude witch approached Sally. 

"Sally, I'm gonna need you to drink this." Madeline said. 

"Uh Uh. No." Sally said, closing her mouth tightly, shaking her head. Tony approached her and grabbed her head and chin, forcing her mouth open. Madeline took advantage, forcing the contents of the goblet into Sally's mouth, filling her mouth with the gross fluid. It had the consistency of cake batter, but the taste of rotted vegetables. It tasted awful, but the fluid seemed to have a mind of its own, sliding to the back of her throat, eager to be swallowed. Before she could think twice, she consumed the fluid. 

Sally felt a wave of nausea hit her as the fluid entered her stomach. She got dizzy and fell from the chair as a wave of heat and sickness went through her body. Her vision was fuzzy and she couldn't think straight. The only thing clear was the evil cackle of victory echoing in her ears. 

********** 

Sally's head was heavy as she began to regain her bearings, hoping that what had happened was simply a nightmare. Her boyfriend had betrayed her. As had her friends. Her boyfriend fucked another woman, an evil insane woman, and had reveled in it. It couldn't be true. It couldn't be real. As her vision cleared up. She looked up at her friends. All of them were now dressed and cleaned up. Tony, Timmy, Dom and Nadine. Then she saw Madeline, clothed in her colonial clothing again, with her arm around Alex, fully clothed again. He looked like he normally did, but there was a certain arrogance across this face to let her know that this nightmare was reality. Sally leaned up against the wall, sitting against it as the older woman approached. Madeline kneeled in front of the 18- year-old. Sally looked at this woman, terrified at the damage she had wrought. 

"I thank you for coming here, Sally." Madeline said. "With your help, I am now free. I can leave this house for good. Thanks to you." 

"What?" Sally asked, confused. 

"It's the house that's the key." Madeline began. "That was the trick they used when they imprisoned me. Instead of simply cursing me, they cursed the house and bound me to it. In a way, it is clever. If they simply cursed me, there are ways to work around that. But to make the curse outside of me was a way to prevent me from breaking it. It took a long time, but I figured it out. And even though they were very clever in their plot, I was more clever. I found a way to escape. The curse lies with the house, and I am not able to break said curse while inside it. But... I can transfer the curse. That is why they blocked this house, prevented anyone from entering it. But you, you ambitious girl, brought you and your friends and your boyfriend here, allowing me to make my escape." 

"The world betrayed me. They locked me in here to protect the innocent. Now, I get my revenge. I created a betrayal, and am now protecting the innocent. I recreated what happened to me in a different light. I made your boyfriend betray you for me. Now he is my property and I will take him for my uses. I will take your boyfriend, and your friends, and they will help me get my revenge. I know you cared deeply for them, and they use to feel the same for you. Not anymore. Now, they care for me more. We will leave this place, now that I am uncursed. The world is corrupted. No place for the innocent. I reversed the curse, Sally. Where as before, what kept me here was that I was the person called corrupt, the world was innocent. Now, the corruption has spread, and the only place locked off from that world is here. In you. You are the innocent being protected from the corruption." 

"What are you saying?" Sally asked, scared. 

"You have inherited my curse, Sally. Meaning, the house holds you now, and you cannot escape. The world is corrupt, and you are innocent, and that separates you from it. You are trapped here, for eternity, unless you figure out how to break your curse." 

"WHAT!" Sally cried out. 

"I'm afraid so. It was the only way for me to escape. You have now inherited not only my imprisonment, but my immortality. As long as you are here, you will not age. You are frozen as is, much like how I was. I am now mortal again, and I have never felt more alive. And your only way to escape is to recreate the circumstances of your imprisonment. Specifically, your only way out is to steal someone's true love, make them a betrayer, and transfer your curse to them. But don't worry. You have all the tools you need to learn to make the correct spells and potions. You have all the books you will need. But the only question is... do you have the body for it? Do you have what it takes to steal another woman's man? Considering you lost your man to an old lady like me. And looking at those feeble breasts, I think your chances are low." Madeline said with a condescending laugh. "So you'd better get settled here. I think you're in for a long stay." 

"Wait! You can't do this! I came here to vindicate you! I came here to help! How could you do this to me!" Sally said, panicking. Madeline smiled arrogantly as she stood up straight. "Alex! Please! Listen to me! Don't leave!" Alex matched Madeline's arrogance, uncaring as he looked down at his girlfriend, unaffected by her panic. He truly was corrupted. 

"Nadine! Dom! Please!" she begged. Nadine wasn't paying attention. She was making out with Dom, unaware of what Sally was going through. She pulled her lips away and looked at her best friend. 

"I can't wait till Madeline lets me fuck Alex! I always thought he was really tasty looking! Maybe I can get Dom and Alex to double team me!" Nadine said with a laugh. 

"Dom?" Sally pled. 

"Nadine said once we leave, she'll let me fuck her ass. So... I'm gonna go." he said, his eyes glowing like Nadine's were. 

"Tony! Timmy! Help me!" she screamed out. 

"Give it up, Sal. Madeline's gonna help me fuck your mom. I can't wait. I'm gonna fuck your mom and take your Daddy's place! I'm gonna seduce your mom, make her take my dick, and destroy your parent's perfect marriage! I can't fucking wait! Thanks for bringing me to Madeline. Thanks for making this happen" Timmy replied, unsympathetic. 0

"What! You can't? They've been in love since they were kids!" Sally cried out, but Timmy just laughed evilly. Seeing there was no hope there, Sally moved on. 

"Tony! Please!" she begged. 

"You broke my heart. I'll break yours." Tony said succinctly. 

"Don't worry, Sally. Your friends will be well cared for. Dom and Nadine here will be together forever and have lots of beautiful babies together. They truly were made for each other. Timmy will have a very important job. Your mother will be quite panicked with you gone. Timmy here will explain what happened, and give her all the comfort she will ever need until she betrays you too and forgets all about you. And judging by what I've heard, she will need a lot of comfort. Tony here will be my bodyguard. I will give him guidance and purpose, and I will fix him up with someone special. One of my followers. And Alex... I will keep him well cared for. I will give him all the children he needs, and he will be my most fervent supporter. He gave me my freedom, the final ingredient for my escape, and that will not be forgotten. I will give your boyfriend whatever he needs. Anything he's ever wanted, I'll be the one to give it to him." Madeline explained. 

"Goodbye Sally." Madeline said. "And remember: Innocence must be protected! Ha Ha!" she added with a lilting laugh. With a nod, she pointed her head at the door, and began walking away, the others following behind her as they headed up the stairs. 

"No! You can't do this to me! This can't be happening!" Sally said, trying to stand, but the effects of the potion made her head swim. She couldn't stand up straight. She heard the footsteps above her, but she just couldn't move. Finally, gathering all her focus, she got to her feet and tried to follow the others. She had to get up. She had to fight back. Otherwise, her world was ending. Her boyfriend had been stolen from her. Her best friend's had all betrayed her. Her parent's marriage was on the precipice of destruction. A great evil was about to be unleashed on the world. And she was about to be trapped in this fucking house! Sally had to fight on. She had to fight back. 

Madeline approached the front door hopefully. Despite her cool demeanor, her hand was shaking as she reached for the handle. For the first time in over 300 years, she would be leaving this fucking house. 

Grabbing the cool handle, she pulled the door open, revealing the cool night air and the full moon in the sky. Madeline stood in the doorframe. This was it. This was the barrier she had never been able to cross. The spell stopped her from being able to cross this entranceway and leave. Part of her wondered if her maneuver had been for naught. The cool night air blew in, making the old witch shiver. She looked around, studied her surroundings a bit, and smiled. Suddenly, she knew the truth. 

She was free. 

With a sure step, Madeline stepped outside, setting foot outdoors for the first time since her capture. The cool air blew across her, but the sensation was glorious. Her feet hit the ground, crunching the leaves beneath her. The others followed behind her. Madeline turned to face them and smiled. 

"Let's go! We have a world to conquer!" 

Minutes later, the van was driving away from the Cursed House of Crow. Six people entered, and six people left. 

Alex drove the car. He glanced over at the others in the car. Next to him was Madeline, looking forward, never wavering. Alex glanced at his friends. Tony and Timmy were in back, smiling evilly, their eyes glowing red. 

In the middle seat was Dom and Nadine. Like their friends, their eyes blazed with red. But they were not sitting tight. Nadine was bent over, fishing Dom's dick from his pants. Dom was fussing with his phone, and as he put it to his ear, Nadine's mouth wrapped around his thickening shaft. 

"Hey, Rachel?" Dom said into his phone. "Yeah, it's me. Uh, listen, shut up. I'm breaking up with you." There was a long pause. "Why? Cause you look like a lesbian." Nadine smiled around Dom's cock at this. "And besides, I'm fucking another girl now, and she's way hotter than you, and that's really all that matters, so..." 

Dom hung up and allowed himself to fully enjoy the blowjob he was getting. 

"We have a lot of work to do." Madeline began. "But first, I need a new wardrobe. Nadine, you must take me shopping. I need to blend in. I'm afraid these clothes are rather plain by today's standards. And besides, I am desperate to try on some of those thongs I've heard so much about." 

All the teens laughed at this, and the witch smiled, satisfied her control was absolute. A new world was ahead of her. And Madeline couldn't wait. She had a church to get revenge on. And a world to conquer. She licked her lips in anticipation. 

All the teens were so engrossed by Madeline that none of them cared to look back at the house they just left. If any of them bothered to look back, they would have seen a figure in the doorway, unable to cross that barrier and leave the house. They would have seen that figure fall to her knees, sobbing. 

And if they opened the windows and listened, they would have heard her screams.

(Epilogue) 

Mother Superior Catherine stepped into her office. It was Halloween Night, and the church was throwing a Halloween Bash. For the most part, it gave some of the church goers and some of the nuns an excuse to dress slutty and hook up with guys, and Catherine was totally okay with that. Catherine stepped away when she was told someone was waiting for her in her office. 

Catherine stepped in and noticed a woman standing by a window. Catherine realized this woman looked familiar. She had seen her seated at the back of the church these last few weeks. She never spoke to anyone and or said anything. She just sat and watched. But what stood out about her was her looks. She was an older woman, probably in her 40's but she was clearly beautiful and elegant. Also, she dressed like a woman half her age, wearing tight, body hugging clothing and sporting a blatant whale-tail. 

But this night, she took advantage of the Halloween theme. She wore a long black dress, like something a witch would wear. It was made of black material, with lacy parts all over, and as the woman turned to face her, Catherine realized the dress was very low-cut, showing off the woman's expansive chest, pouring from her tight dress. 

"Can I help you?" Catherine asked. 

"It's nice to see you've embraced your corruption." the woman said. 

"Excuse me?" Catherine asked. 

"Well, just look at yourself." the woman said, indicating the nun's body hugging habit, and the way it showed off her huge tits. And her heavily pregnant belly. "Nuns typically didn't get knocked up back in my day." 

"Times have changed." Catherine replied. 

"Is this your first?" the woman asked. 

"My second." the nun stated. 

"And married as well? How is your man?" the woman asked. 

"He's wonderful. Still the mayor, hopefully soon something more than that." Catherine replied hesitantly. "And you are?" she asked, eyebrow raised. 

"My name is Madeline, but you already knew that." she said. Catherine walked around her desk as the woman took a seat on the other side. 

"I'm sorry. Should I know you?" Catherine asked. 

"From what I can tell, this whole town knows me." Madeline replied. She dug out a picture from her clothes and held it out to Catherine. Catherine looked at it. It was a famous picture in this city. A picture of that old witch, Madeline Crow, who died hundreds of years ago. Catherine looked back at the woman, only to realize this woman looked exactly like the woman in the picture. 

"You're not saying...?" Catherine asked. 

"I am." Madeline replied. "Don't act like you don't know me, bitch! This may be a very different church than the one I knew before, but you still have the same secrets. The same corruption. Trust me, I've seen it. I know you still have your secret files out there about the sins and dark magic the church has committed. Crimes committed against people like me." 

"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about..." Catherine said. "But if you are who you say you are, how did you escape?" 

"I used some very dark magic to keep myself alive these many years. Until a group of teens entered my home, and I was able to transfer my curse onto a girl who had come there to vindicate me. I feel so sorry for that poor girl, trapped due to the magic the church performed. I take no blame for her current predicament. That is on you. The church." Madeline explained. 

"So, why are you here?" Catherine asked. 

"I am here to deliver a warning to the church. I know who you are. Despite my imprisonment, I kept my eyes on you. I watched you come in and embrace your corruption. I watched you spread your tendrils to the government, to the handsome, successful mayor, seizing control of the city. And I had to admit, even I was impressed at how brazen you were. Your convent has gotten very large. I've seen your girls all over town, beautiful girls, doing some very naughty things to 'help' the church. I had girls like that once, in service to me, but the church murdered them in cold blood. But I'll get them back. My loyal followers used to do whatever I wanted. They tracked down the reverend who imprisoned me, and they made him pay. Oh, they made him pay. But getting my revenge on him does not absolve the church of its crimes against the innocent. The church has been a corrupt institution for far too long. Unfortunately, my followers could only do so much, and too much time has passed. So sadly, they are all gone now. For years, I was alone in this world. But no longer! I already have gathered followers. And they have been very busy." 

Madeline paused, thinking about the group of teens she had acquired, and what they had been up to since her capture of them. Tony had been a loyal bodyguard, as she knew he would be. Madeline was working hard to find her former apprentice's spirit, to bring her back to life, bring her sprit to modern day. And once she was back, she would be Tony's bride. Timmy had taken to her guidance beautifully. Madeline could tell he would be quite talented when under the right leadership. He had already bedded Sally's gorgeous mother, and had flaunted this affair in front of Sally's father, tearing apart their marriage efficiently. Nadine and Dom had spent most of their time in bed, fucking each other's brains out. Nadine had commanded them to breed, and they were more than happy to comply. As was Timmy with Sally's mom. And finally, there was Alex, her most loyal follower. He was there whenever she needed him, doing whatever she asked. That mainly consisted of fucking her brains out and filling her pussy and asshole with cum, and the young man was always happy to do it. She was taking the same advice she had given to Nadine and Dom. She needed to start breeding as soon as possible. They needed to increase their numbers as quickly as they could. She needed Alex to fill her up with cum and give her lots of babies. Lots of babies. 

"My followers will be tenfold than what they were before. And then I'll make you pay. Your church is very different, but the corruption remains the same. Like I said, I know who you are. I know what you are capable of. And it won't happen again. This time, this visit, I'm simply giving you a warning. Next time, I won't be so nice." Madeline warned. 

"Are you threatening me?" Catherine asked, "Cause if you are, you don't know who you are dealing with." 

This made Madeline smile. She stood up and smoothed out her dress, showing off her massive rack. 

"Well then, next time we meet will certainly be a surprise for one of us." Madeline said. 

"Yeah, I bet." Catherine said. Madeline smiled arrogantly and walked out of the office, shaking her butt at the nun. Catherine paused, making sure she was gone, and picked up the phone. She dialed the numbers quickly, and waited for a reply. As soon as she heard a voice on the other side, she spoke up. 

"We have a problem." Catherine said. "The witch is free." 

As the nun listened to the voice on the other end, she knew something big was coming. 

If Madeline Crow wanted a war, she would get it. Report_Story
