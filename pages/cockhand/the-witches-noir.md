***** 

October 29th. 

A beautiful fall morning, the leaves turned to the colors of autumn. Trees a lovely shade of gold and red on Mockingbird Lane, lining both sides of the street. The dawn's early chill just starting to dissipate as the sun begins its task of warming the day. A slight breeze rustles the fallen leaves and a bird begins its morning song. 

In a nice two story home Tabitha Smith is getting out of her morning shower. Drying her body off and thinking about the day ahead. A full day of classes to get through before the weekend. 

Next door, her best friend Jenna, is also getting her morning rituals out of the way. Best friends and neighbors their entire lives, they get ready for school. Their homes nearly identical. Their parents nearly identical. Their school schedules nearly identical. 

As Tabitha brushed her long auburn hair she looked at her body in the mirror. Slim with just enough curves. Her green eyes were her most striking feature. Flat tummy and perky breasts. Not too big but just big enough. 

As Jenna looked at her own reflection, in her home next door, she smiled. Her big breasts definitely her best asset, next to her pert little bubble butt. Her blonde hair the same straight style as her best friend Tabitha. 

At the same time, both girls got ready for the day. Tabitha wearing only her favorite bat wing necklace as she picked out her clothes. Jenna wearing just a tiny little cross on a chain. A gift from her great aunt. She only wore it cause she loved how it looked hanging in her cleavage on days she wore a low cut top. Days like today. 

Both girls favored black, crisp clothing. Almost but not quite a goth look, that went along with their favorite thing to do. Which was practicing witchery and witchcraft. It all started a few years ago, with Tabitha suggesting it. Always her follower Jenna quickly took to it. 

With a quick text to each other the girls finished getting dressed and ready. Tabitha wearing a long black skirt with a lace overskirt and a black tank top covered by a purple sweater. Jenna had decided on black skinny jeans with a red tunic shirt over. Both girls with the same black flats, loads of dark eye makeup, pale complexions and plenty of silver bracelets. 

They met in front of Jenna's house and began the short walk to school. Chatting about the coming Halloween and talking about classes and girly things, they held hands. It wasn't a sexual thing, just best friends and almost sisterly. As the morning warmed up they arrived at campus and the first thing they saw was the hated group. The barbies. The cheerleaders. 

The head cheerleader Britney saw them and it started at once. "Oh look, here come the freaks," she giggled. Her partners laughing behind her. "Good morning freaks," she went on, laughing. Jenna simply lowered her blue eyes and quietly kept walking. But Tabitha glared at the barbies and told Britney, "Fuck off plastic bitch!" 

"Just keep walking like your girlfriend," Britney snapped as they passed the group of cheerleaders. Tabitha just glared and gave her the one finger salute. 

"You wish," Britney said, laughing. Finishing with the classic insult, "Dyke." Before it could escalate, Jenna tugged Tabitha away. Her hand pulling as she quietly removed herself and Tabitha from the situation. 

"Don't let her get to you Tabz, she's not worth it," Jenna told her, but Tabitha was fuming. Her pale skin flushed red in anger. "Now that," said Jenna, pointing at the school's star quarterback, Chad, "is definitely worth getting worked up over," she giggled. Tabitha rolled her eyes and kept walking with Jenna. 

While not out about it, Tabitha was quite a bit bisexual. Preferring girls, she never shared that secret with anyone but Jenna, and Jen teased her about it constantly, as only best friends can. But she was still angry. Ignoring Chad, Tabitha was boiling in her skin. 

"I'm going to fix that Britney one of these days," she said angrily. "She will be so sorry she messed with us," she went on, as Jenna dreamily watched Chad. His blonde hair like hers, his muscles rippling like some sort of greek god. He was a walking dream to her, and she would do anything to be with him. He was all she could think about sometimes. Sometimes in the shower. Sometimes late at night. She bit her lip and thought maybe she would think about him tonight. Her panties moistened at the thought of that. 

Meanwhile Tabitha couldn't stop being angry. She thought all of the stupid games and all the mean spirited nonsense would stop now that they were freshmen in college. And to some extent it was true. People were more accepting of diversity at the University, and there were even a few girls like her and Jenna. A few witches here and there but not a coven. Not yet. Maybe that would change but for now, all she could think of was how to get back at Britney. 

Most of the rest of the morning passed as it usually does in a school of this nature. Classes and a bit of socializing in the halls and in the library. The usual amount of grab ass and the usual wankers. 

Jenna and Tabitha had almost every class together and spent the day studying with each other in quiet corners and what not, when not at lectures and such. The only time they saw Britney again was in passing, and every time she had some comment to make. Usually something rude and usually something to do with the girls being freaks or lesbians. 

Jenna took it all with a calm demeanor, but inside Tabitha was raging. The only thing holding her back was her best friend. She kept thinking, if Jen can take it, so can I. And that helped her through her day. 

The fall afternoon was crisp, almost chilly, when the last classes were finally drawing to a close. Tabitha and Jenna started for home, holding hands again. The leaves blowing across the campus and the sun beginning its slow autumn's descent. 

The smell of wood smoke from fireplaces and the smell of fall filled the air. Both girls walked quietly for a time, thinking their own thoughts. As they passed the practice fields both looked on, with differing thoughts. 

Tabitha watched the cheerleaders stretching, her nemesis Britney at the front. All in workout shorts and sweats and the like. While she actually hated the head cheerleader Britney, she did feel a stir of something like lust when she watched her stretching. After all, who wouldn't? The blonde cheerleader was quite the object of many fantasies around the campus, and poor little bisexual Tabitha was no different. Yes a grudge fuck would do quite nicely. With a giggle she cut that train of thought. 

Jenna, meanwhile, caught sight of the object of her fantasies. The star quarterback. Chad. She saw him, in shorts and a muscle shirt, throwing practice passes and very quietly, she nearly swooned. Her body trembled a bit at the thought of his muscular arm around her, and she bit her lip. 

While both girls walked, quietly lusting, neither one even entertained the possibility of a tryst. You see, it was quite well known that the head cheerleader and the star quarterback were such a cliche couple. Why would they not be? They were such a perfect couple that their gene pool, if combined, would probably produce some kind of genetically perfect offspring. 

So it was that Tabitha and Jenna just held hands and quietly walked home. As they got to their neighboring houses they stopped to talk for a bit. Complaining about homework and such. The houses on their lane were decorated with pumpkins, goblins, and such-and-such ghoulish and garish goodies. The trees so lovely, the smells of Fall in the air. 

"Call me later Tabz," Jenna said. Squeezing her best friend's hand. "We can figure out the weekend," she added. Smiling. 

"I will Jen but don't forget, I'm driving my parents to the airport tonight," Tabitha told her. Looking at her house, at her cat in the window. A black feline with a temperamental nature. Perfect for a young witch. Tabitha's parents were leaving that night to spend Halloween in Vegas, a four day adventure. She decided to stay because Jenna couldn't go, of course. 

"Awww okay Tabz," said Jenna, giving Tabitha a mock pout. "I'm sorry you have to spend Halloween with poor little me," she said, giggling at Tabitha. The breeze blowing her blonde hair and catching her golden highlights. Tabitha noticed and smiled at how beautiful her best friend was. 

"Don't forget you promised to help me clean up my grandma's old cabin Jen," Tabitha reminded her. At this Jenna rolled her eyes. Tabitha's grandmother had passed away a few years ago and her cabin had sat abandoned, until recently when her parents had decided to sell it. It was in decent condition and just needed some cleaning and for some old boxes to be disposed of. Nobody had been out there to really look at the place, as the old woman had only used it occasionally. Her house in the hills being her primary residence. 

"My parents said we could spend the weekend, watching scary movies Jen, and eating pizza!" Tabitha exclaimed. Bringing a smile to Jenna's face. "I'll sneak us a bottle or two of merlot, and maybe we can try some spell casting again," Tabitha suggested. Again, causing Jenna to grin quite cheerily. 

While wanting to be witches, and trying to cast spells, both girls were not quite successful. No matter how much sage they burned, and how many different attempts, nothing ever really came of their efforts. But that didn't stop them from trying. Both girls just thought they needed the right atmosphere and the right vibe and the power would flow and they would become full fledged witches. 

So with a warm hug and promises to call later that night, maybe have a sleepover at Tabitha's house, the two young wannabe witches parted ways for the evening. 

All Hallows Eve...Fifty years earlier... 

In the darkly shadowed sub-cellar, six witches gather in a semi-circle. Chanting in an ancient tongue, all of them naked save for hooded black cloaks. A seventh witch leads the chant. Rose Smith, a beautiful auburn haired, green eyed woman, also naked save for patent leather thigh high boots with high spike heels. Strapped around her waist, a viciously long, thick, black rubber cock. Ribbed and with a bulbous head, the shaft covered in oil. Her arms raised in supplication as the other six of the coven raise their chant to a fever pitch. 

The group of women in a semi-circle around a raised stone altar. The top carved with a pentagram, the sides etched with arcane sigils of diabolic nature. And spread eagle, chained to the altar, naked, a trembling young blonde. Gagged and chained down tightly, her arms and legs spread wide, tears running down her face. 

Stepping forth, Rose Smith moves up onto the altar, between the young girls spread legs. Kneeling, she places the tip of the brutal rubber cock to the entrance of the blonde's slit and begins her invocation. 

"Hear us, our dark Master, and heed our wishes," she says, as she eases the tip into the squirming girls pussy. 

"Accept this virgin sacrifice, Lord X'har, and grant us that which we desire," she intones. Her last word punctuated with a hard thrust of her strapon into the blonde's virgin pussy. Breaking her cherry in one hard thrust. The coven chanting louder, and more frenetic. 

As Rose Smith slid out, the virgin blood seeped onto the altar slowly, into the dark pentagram. With a smile, Rose stood up, looking down at the helpless girl as she sobbed. The chanting stopped, and all became silent. Every woman holding her breath, awaiting whatever may happen next. 

Slowly, a mist, a fog, begin to take shape. Filling the room along one wall, creeping towards the altar. A collective gasp came from the coven, as the realization of their summoning begin to manifest itself. The mist becoming as smoke, so thick as to be impenetrable. Through the silence of the room, came a deep, heavy, breathing. 

"Who dares awaken me?" came a guttural voice. Deep and threatening. Another gasp from the coven as two red and baleful eyes appeared in the thick grey smoke. "Who deems themselves worthy to invoke my presence?" the voice continued. A palpable presence filling the room with horror. Two of the coven cackling in terror and fainting down to the floor. 

"I dare to invoke you Lord X'har," Rose Smith said, a tremble in her voice. "Give to me that which I desire and accept this virgin as sacrifice," she finished. 

For an eternity, silence and the demon's deep breathing filled the chamber. Then it spoke, in nearly a joyous voice. 

"I require more, mortal, and I shall have more," he said. His presence still as yet, only the two red eyes glaring from the mist. In an instant, tentacles burst from the smoke, in all directions. Wrapping around six slender hooded necks, and snapping six slender hooded necks all at once. Their bones cracking like dry twigs in a dry forest. Pulling back, the tentacles retracted and all at once, the entire coven perished and disappeared into the mist. The hapless young blonde chained to the altar perished as well, her heart not up to the task of the horror she was witness to. 

Standing, naked save for her thigh high boots and strapon cock, Rose Smith prepared to die, her aspirations a fool's quest and her greed unfulfilled. Awaiting her fate, resigned, Rose prepared for damnation. The tentacles claiming the blonde from the altar, easily breaking the binding chains. Leaving Rose alone, facing the smoke and mist. 

Then a grin and a sneer came to her face, as a taloned, black as obsidian claw came from the mist. Around two fingers, two silver chains dangled. On each chain a pendant. One a sun, one a moon. Presented to her, as she grinned in evil glee. 

"The dark and light as one, the moon rules the sun," the voice said, as the claw tossed the talismans at Rose's feet. They fell with a jingle, and as slowly at it appeared, the mist and smoke faded. Leaving Rose Smith alone, chuckling, in front of the virgin blood stained altar... 

October 30th 

After a four hour drive into the mountains, and a quick stop at the last gas station for 30 miles before the forest wilderness, Tabitha and Jenna open the door to the old cabin. The musty smell assaulted their nostrils first thing, then the dusty smell of aged wood and old books. There were some tracks on the porch from a racoon or some such animal but on the whole the place looked undisturbed. Jenna looked around and Tabitha checked the mailbox, and both girls came up empty. They looked at each other and burst out laughing, a girl's weekend alone, a witching weekend alone, and Halloween to boot! 

"This is going to be easy," Jenna said, looking around the kitchen. The shelves neatly organized and tidy except for a bit of dust. Tabitha nodded in reply as she checked the fusebox, finding that the cabin still had power. The furniture was neatly arranged, a small television in the corner. 

"I hope you brought Netflix," Tabitha said, as she looked at the old tv set. "No way we're getting dish up here," she giggled. Jenna grinned and reached into her bag, pulling out a tablet with a few memory cards. 

"No need Tabz, I got ten hours of Gossip Girl and ten hours of Kim and Khloe," she giggled. Rolling her eyes Tabitha laughed and asked, "But do you have anything worth watching?" 

After some laughs and some looking around, the girls got to work. Cleaning and dusting about. Tabitha found a mop, and soon the hardwood floors looked shiny and new. Both girls wearing little shorts, halter tops, flip flops, and of course their favorite necklaces. 

Taking a break, Jenna looked at some pictures on the wall. "Tell me about your grandma Tabz," she said. Looking at one picture of the beautiful Rose Smith with a group of young, equally beautiful women. 

"I never really knew Grandma Rose," Tabitha said, as she was finishing up mopping the room. The only spot left was a section under a rug. "She passed on when I was still very young, under strange circumstances, so I'm told," she continued, as she put down the mop and bent over to move the rug. 

Putting down the photograph, Jenna bent down and helped Tabitha pull the rug over and roll it up. After they put the rolled up rug aside both girls looked at the floor. At a hidden trapdoor. Tabitha tilted her head and said, "Huh." Jenna looked at her and smiled, then both girls knelt down, opening the heavy wooden portal. 

Peering down, they saw a set of stairs leading to darkness. Tabitha looked at Jen and said, "You go first," with a laugh. Jenna looked back at Tabitha and both girls started giggling. Taking out their phones for light, they slowly and very cautiously started down the stairs. 

Getting to the bottom, they saw it wasn't so creepy. Just a basement. Looking around, Jenna found a single bulb hanging with a pull chain. Turning it on, Jenna and Tabitha looked around. 

"We're not cleaning this mess," Jenna said. The dust thick and the shelves full of cobwebs. Looking around, they found jars of preserves. All sorts of jars. More dusty old brooms, at least three of them, the old style of straw, were leaning in one corner. There were no windows to the outside, but there was a stack of old newspapers and a pile of old clothes. 

Looking to the other side, opposite the door, they found it. A chest, very heavy looking and made of some sort of solid dark wood. Bound with golden straps and the lid locked shut with an old style of padlock neither girl had ever seen before. 

"Do you think it's full of your grandma's treasure?" joked Jenna. Tabitha laughed but she was thinking the same thing. The heavy chest looked out of place and they both noticed it was unusually free of the dust that covered every other surface in the basement. 

"We need to find the key," Tabitha said. "I don't suppose you saw any old keys laying around upstairs?" she asked Jenna. The reply she got, of course, was a shrug. 

"We don't need a key," Jenna said with a wink. Taking a hairpin from her blonde tresses, she giggled. "I never told you, my uncle was a few things and a thief was one of them. He taught me a few tricks before he uh, went away," she giggled. Kneeling down, Jenna examined the lock. Tabitha just shook her head as she watched. 

It took all of two minutes for Jenna to pick the lock and it clicked open with a satisfying metallic pop. Looking at each other, both girls smiled. 

"We're gonna be rich," Jenna giggled as she tried to open the heavy lid. It took both girls using all their strength to finally lift it up, and when they did, both girls could almost swear it felt like the chest exhaled a deep breath. Like a breath that had been held for years, blowing out in triumphant escape. 

Looking down into the chest, Tabitha sighed and said, "I guess we're not going to be rich." Jenna giggled and held Tabitha's hand, replying, "Yeah, but it looks like your grandmother was a freak." 

In the chest, were less items than it would have held even it it were a tiny percentage full. The freak comment from Jenna was brought on by seeing a pair of black patent leather, thigh high, spike heeled boots. On top of them was a particularly long, thick, veiny, and realistic black strapon cock. That brought a giggle from both girls. 

Next to that lay a book bound with some kind of strange looking hide. From some kind of animal perhaps. No title or words on the cover save for some strange symbol neither girls recognized from any of their witchcraft books. And just there, on top of the book, two shiny silver chains. Each with a different pendant. A sun, and a moon.  

===

Save for those items and a long, bejewed, and ornate type of key, the chest was empty. Tabitha picked up the key, and turned it over in her dainty hand. Her black fingernails shiny next to the dull silver of the key, and complimenting the jewels on the skull shaped end. 

"What do you think it opens?" Jenna asked. Both girls looked around again, but no door was forthcoming. "I bet it opens the real treasure chest," Jenna continued, giggling. As she giggled, Jenna reached into the chest and picked up the silver chains, letting them dangle from her fingertips. 

"These have to be worth something," she said. "They're heavy, like high quality silver." The chains swinging from her fingers, catching the light and shining brightly. 

Tabitha shrugged and put the key down, then picked up the book. Slowly opening it, she told Jenna, "It's warm?" That brought a frown and another shrug from her best friend. Both girls may have thought it weird, but that didn't quell the curiosity inimical to young girls. 

A trace of wonder in her voice, she opened it and said, "I recognize some of these words Jenna, this is a magic grimoire. A spell book. My grandma was a witch!" she exclaimed. Her eyes wide in surprise and delight. Jenna bounced a little and giggled. Both girls looking at the pages, the words written in some sort of red ink and several of the pages scribbled in pencil. It never occurred to the best friends that perhaps the book was written in blood and bound in human flesh. But that's none of my business. 

"This spell is for luck, and this one says something about sissification. This one says bimbofication. And this one is for turning straw into gold!" Tabitha went on. Her voice rising in pitch. "Here, a love spell, and this one is to ensure a plentiful harvest," she kept going. Jenna wasn't as practiced at reading the symbols or the strange words as Tabitha, but she understood enough to follow along. And she agreed with whatever Tabitha was saying. 

"This book is just what we needed Tabz," Jenna said, as they looked over the pages. Tabitha already forming an idea in her head. Biting her lip at the devious thought. Bimbofication for her nemesis Britney, just as a little payback. It could always be reversed by reading the spell backwards. Thats how it works. And just to help her best friend, a love spell on the dreamy quarterback Chad. Just for Jenna. Yes, it would be perfect. 

"Tomorrow is Halloween Jen, let's try it then and see how it works?" Tabitha suggested. Giggling, Jenna nodded yes and bit her lip as well. "We might make fine witches after all," Jenna agreed. 

That's about the time Tabitha made a big mistake. Her first one. A doozy to start with. Picking up the necklace with the moon pendant she said, "I'm going to try this one on, try the other one Jen." 

As Tabitha was clasping the necklace around her neck, Jenna picked up the one with the sun pendant. An eerie feeling crept over her and she shivered but nevertheless reached back and clasped it on her slender neck. Both girls looked at each other and giggled, at first. Nothing happened but then, the delayed reaction was nearly instant. 

Tabitha felt the power, the magic, flow through her. She laughed and thought she would fly through the basement ceiling and through the cabin and around the world. For a fleeting few seconds the power coursed through her body, making her feel invincible. Then she lost control. The strange feeling of power giving way to the feeling of a loss of herself. The magic within the demonic pendant far too powerful for Tabitha to control. 

Jenna, meanwhile, felt nothing at first. But as Tabitha was feeling raw, unchecked power, Jenna began to feel a weight on her shoulders. A binding weight full of feelings of dread. Feelings of fright, and the need to be comforted and taken care of. Taken control of. She whispered, "The dark and light as one, the moon rules the sun." 

As the power of the demonic pendants continued coursing through both of them, Tabitha smirked at Jenna saying, "I know where the key fits now," she said. Picking up the ornate key and pointing to one of the shelves. "Open it Jenna," she commanded, and Jenna went to the shelf. Tugging on it, it slid open to reveal a hidden door. As she revealed the door, Jenna whispered again, "The dark and light as one, the moon rules the sun." 

Both of the necklaces felt warm now, the pendants beginning to glow softly. Tabitha stepped forward and the key seemed drawn to the hidden lock. The hidden knob. Both turned easily with a click that was too loud for the small secret door. As it creaked open, a breath as if from the dust of ages blew past both girls, blowing their hair. 

Tabitha's eyes took on a baleful tint as she turned to Jenna, once again saying, "You first but, you don't need those clothes." Jenna only nodded quietly and untied her halter top, pulling it off before stripping her shorts and panties. Stepping out off her flip flops she started down the uneven stone steps into the darkness. Tabitha watched her best friend head down naked before making her own changes. 

As Jenna reached the sub-cellar and stopped, she looked around. In the darkness she couldn't make out the features of the room. The chill causing her big pink nipples to stiffen. Hearing clicking coming down the stairs she turned, and in the shaft of light she saw her best friend Tabitha. 

Using her phone as a flashlight Tabitha illuminated Jenna, eyeing her naked body up and down. From her dainty little feet and up her long legs to her thin tummy and over her big breasts. Only her little cross and the sun necklace adorning her pale skin. With a grin, Tabitha reached the bottom of the steps and Jenna saw what she was now wearing. The thigh high boots, and the demonic moon necklace, and around her waist the huge black strapon cock. 

"You won't be needing this Jenna," Tabitha said. Sneering, with a flick of her finger the little gold cross and chain snapped off Jenna's slender neck and flew into a corner of the chamber. "Now let's light some candles," she continued. Her phone's light illuminating a small table next to the foot of the steps. Upon which rested a box of wooden matches and a candle snuffer made of brass. 

It took the two girls five minutes to light the dozens of candles in sconces, on stone outcrops, and in the few candelabras spread out around the room. All the while, everytime Tabitha told Jenna something the reply was always the same. The dark and light as one, the moon rules the sun. Neither girl realizing they were under the necklace's baleful and spiteful influence. 

Pointing to the stone altar, Tabitha told her best friend, "Lay there Jenna, on your back." Her grin wide and ominous under the candles flickering light. As Jenna lay on the altar she shivered, despite the odd fact that the altar was somehow warm. Neither girl realizing that the sigils and pentagram were not the type of magic iconography they were familiar with. Smiling, Tabitha walked around the altar, using the chains already in place to secure Jenna down tightly. Her wrists and ankles cuffed and spread, Jenna could only lay quietly as Tabitha did her work. Stepping back, Tabitha bit her lip with lust. 

"I've watched your body Jenna, waiting for this moment. You've been such a tease," she told her helpless friend. "I'm sorry," was Jenna's only reply. Quietly watching, her eyes glued to the massive rubber cock swinging between her best friend's legs. Tabitha grinned, and said, "You will be," as she took a candle, black and tapered, from a sconce. 

Walking alongside Jenna's chained down body she grinned, saying, "The moon rules the sun, the agony makes us one." With those words she tilted the candle, letting the hot wax drip and pour all over Jenna. All over her big tits. All over her cleavage. Down her tummy. And at the last, drip drip dripping hot wax across and over Jenna's blonde pussy. Giggling as she did it, rejoicing in the whimpering, gasping, and mewling in pain coming from her best friend. 

For her part, with every other drop on her perfect body, Jenna could only gasp, "The moon rules the sun. The moon rules the sun." 

"It's time Jenna," Tabitha said. Putting the candle back in its place she turned. Standing at the end of the altar and stroking the thick strapon cock. Tabitha spit in her hand and used that saliva to lube the veiny rubber shaft. Then again. Then once more until the black cock was shiny and wet. Jenna quietly looked up at the ceiling, her eyes fixed in place on a spot of what looked like dried blood. Her mind a blank. 

Crawling up onto the altar, over Jenna's chained and spread body, Tabitha rested the length of the strapon shaft over Jen's slit. Slowly rubbing it back and forth, looking down to see how deep the penetration would be. All the while keeping a wicked grin on her face. The rubber cock and the little pink pussy shiny and wet, easily rubbing together. Then she put the tip to Jenna's entrance. Holding herself up with one arm, her other hand reaching down she guided the tip into Jenna's tight slit. 

"Remember when we played truth or dare last weekend Jen?" she asked, as she pressed the tip just in. "Remember how you confessed you were still a virgin?" she continued, pressing the tip a bit more. 

Chained down, wrist and ankle, her eyes glazed over, and her pink slit parting ever so slightly to Tabitha's strapon, Jenna only replied, "The moon rules the sun." Her little cross long gone and the only pendant around her neck being the silver sun. Resting just in her cleavage, just between her big tits. 

Tabitha's green eyes took on a baleful glint as she pressed the tip in slowly, making Jenna moan softly. Repeating the mantra, the moon rules the sun, Jenna was helpless on the stone altar as Tabitha grinned and slipped in another inch. The thickness of the rubber cock gripped tightly by Jenna's juicy sluice. The cock now held in place by Jenna's pussy, Tabitha moved up a bit and rested her body on both arms. Gaining leverage. 

"Yes Jen, the moon rules the sun, as it always has been," Tabitha said. Punctuating her final word with a hard deep thrust. In one motion, burying the cock all the way inside Jenna and breaking her cherry all at once. Jenna squealed out her mantra now, the words lost in her gasping yelps. 

Leaning down, Tabitha started to kiss Jenna passionately. Her tongue invading Jenna's mouth and swirling around as the cock began to plunge. In and out, over and over again. Tabitha started to pump Jenna harder, fucking her deeply. Jenna's pussy seeping her virginal blood slowly down her slit, and oozing onto the stone altar. Neither girl noticed the temperature in the chamber drop. As lost as they were in carnal lust, neither did they notice the candles flickering as a breeze, a cold breeze, blew through the room. The only sound was the slapping of bodies, the wet squelch of a juicy pussy getting fucked, and the high pitched gasps and moans of a girl taking a long thick cock. Her first. 

"I would guess you're a virgin here too?" Tabitha asked, as she slowly slid the cock out of Jenna. Reaching down to reposition the head. Lining it up with Jenna's tight little rosebud. "That is perfect, just perfect," she said. Slowly pressing against the tight little anal ring, slowly breaking through. Slowly sliding in. 

This time, when her second cherry was broken, Jenna stopped repeating her mantra of the moon ruling the sun. This time, she started screaming. Her body adding more virgin blood to the stone altar. A chill draft blowing across her naked body. Tabitha in thigh high boots, and wearing a brutal strapon, giving Jenna her first experience with anal sex. Grinning as she nailed Jenna's chained body to the stone altar. Tabitha's new necklace jingling as it dangled and clinked against Jenna's new necklace. On into the night. 

The full moon shining lit the cabin with an eerie glow as the girls did the bidding of the demonic necklaces. The wind blew the autumn's gold and red leaves from the trees, and the noise of fall filled the woods. As some deeply hidden part of Jenna screamed inside her, helpless to stop what was being done, the girls unwittingly opened a door to another dimension. The ritual, once started, could not be completed until another sacrifice was made. Jenna, deep in her psyche, was aware of what was happening, but was unable to stop it. 

Tabitha, with a grin and a fell laugh, was also aware of what she was doing. But unlike Jenna, the power of her necklace only made her lust stronger. Her desire more tangible. Her quest for satisfaction a thirst that Jenna's body could not quench. 

And so the long night drew to an end. 

October 31st, Halloween 

Tabitha awoke with a start from a terrible dream. Sitting straight up in bed and looking around, she realized she was at her grandmother's cabin. The night before a distant fading memory, soon out of her grasp. 

"No more wine," she said to herself. Her mouth dry and her head aching. Slowly moving to the bedside, she realized her body was completely naked. Giggling, she said to herself, "Definitely no more wine." 

Wrapping a sheet around her body, she went to find her best friend Jenna, thinking the hangover was probably contagious. No recollection of the previous night, she roamed into the living room. There on the sofa, curled up and covered in a wool blanket, she found Jenna. 

Already awake, Jenna looked up at Tabitha and both girls groaned. Sitting up, her blanket covering her, Jenna also realized she was naked. Completely naked. And for some reason, she felt different. A little sore between the legs in addition to her throbbing head. Tabitha and Jenna looked at each other and both girls burst out giggling. Not the exuberant giggles like the day before but rather, strained and weak chuckles. 

"Never drinking again, like, ever," Jenna swore with a pained giggle. "Agreed!" exclaimed Tabitha, instantly regretting her raised voice as her head throbbed in unison. "I can't even remember last night," Tabitha continued, a bit softer of voice. 

"Me either," Jenna agreed, wrapping her blanket tighter around her naked body. Neither girl quite cognizant of just how naked they both were. No necklaces, no jewelry, and even the flesh completely hairless from the neck down. Both girls completely naked and spent, and it was only the morning. 

"Tabz, a shower, some aspirin, and then some breakfast yeah?" Jenna said. Holding her head with one hand, and groaning. Even the birds outside were quiet, but that silence was too much for two girls nursing epic headaches and epic body aches. "Oh and also Tabz, never drinking again," Jenna giggled. Tabitha in complete agreement. 

The day began, with the warm autumn sun making its slow ascent over the cabin in the woods. Birds here and there chirping, but never too near the domicile. A gentle breeze rustling the trees and overhead clouds making their slow drift across the azure sky. Inside the cabin, the smells of morning. 

The scent of two freshly showered girls. Flowery and perfumy, with hints of lilac and lavender and a touch of exotic plants. Overlaid with the smell of frying bacon, and the scent of fresh strawberries. Music playing at a low volume, the aspirin not quite finished dispelling the headaches dull throb, as both girls entertain the task of a hearty morning's repast. 

While Jenna sat at the table picking at strawberries and flipping through a magazine, Tabitha spotted something on the coffee table. Something bizarrely overlooked all morning, yet now beyond overlooking. A book, bound in hide, open to the middle. With a flash she remembered. The spell book. 

"Jenna!" she exclaimed, giving her best friend a start. Scurrying over, Tabitha picked up the book. 

"My grandmother's spell book! It's Halloween!" she excitedly exclaimed, expunging any extra excision of excretious ecstacy, ever so evenly equally epiphonic. 

Jenna giggled and moved to Tabitha, still walking tenderly. Still sore. Still wondering why. Sitting on the sofa softly, Jenna quietly groaned and Tabitha sat down as well, looking over the open book resting on the coffee table. Flipping the pages and reading the arcane text. 

"We can try these tonight Jen," Tabitha said, looking over the pages and sipping her coffee. "I want to try this bimbification one on that bitch Britney," she went on, as Jenna read, or tried to read, the pages. "And just for fun, let's do this love spell on Chad? For you?" she suggested. Jenna bit her lip and smiled, nodding in approval. 

"Are you sure you can read this Tabz?" Jenna asked, the archaic script beyond her blonde comprehension. "It looks different from the Latin we studied," she went on. The pages covered in writing that barely resembled the dead language. Several glyphs that were unrecognizable and a few pictures drawn in shaky lines. 

"Of course I can Jen," Tabitha replied confidently. Making her second mistake. Underestimating the power of the spell book and overestimating her talents. As she flipped the page to the love spell her wrist tapped her coffee mug, causing a bit of the drink to splash onto the page. Smearing the pencil written script just a bit. Quickly wiping it, she giggled and said, "Ooops." Her third mistake. The wiping of her hand smudging the words just a little. Just a bit. Just enough. 

"We'll try this tonight Jen Jen, down in the cellar where it's quiet and dark, where we can focus," Tabitha said smiling. Jenna grinned back and nodded in approval. And at that, the day progressed. 

The day went on with both girls sort of puttering about, doing some final cleaning. They found some cloaks, hooded ones, in one of the closets, and decided that would be what they wore for the nights spell casting fun. After a while and with the aspirin kicking in, the girls felt better. The throbbing in their heads eased up a bit, and Jenna felt a little less sore. Not completely better but a little less in misery. She still didn't feel quite right but put it down to the wine. Neither girl remembered the previous night's debauchery, and had they done so they would have got the hell out of the cabin with great haste. 

As the sun started to fall, casting long shadows, a chill began to form in the cabin. Halloween chill, gloomy and foreboding. Jenna was apprehensive and Tabitha felt nervous. Neither girl realizing it was a sense of impending doom. 

Tabitha looked over the spell book a few times, the love spell smudged from her earlier accident. Reading it to herself she thought she could improvise, and get the words right. Easy peasy. Jenna took a bath while Tabitha went down to the underground chamber to light candles, having showered first. The stone altar with its arcane glyphs prominent in the candle light. 

At long last, the sun set and the full moon rose to cast its baleful light once again on the cabin in the woods. As they prepared, the girls quietly put on heavy dark makeup. Neither one adorned with jewelry. Jenna put her long blonde hair in a ponytail. A high ponytail. 

"So we try the love spell on Chad first, and then we bimbify Britney yes?" Tabitha asked Jenna as she applied heavy dark eye shadow. Both girls just wearing bra and panties as they prepared. 

"That sounds good Tabz, but will it work if we don't have a talisman from them?" Jenna asked, as she checked her dark red lipstick. "I mean, we won't know until we go back to school anyways right?" she continued. The soreness in her body faded to a dull ache. 

"It will work if you believe it will Jen," Tabitha told her, as she brushed her auburn hair. "You do know we have to be naked for this though, right?" she asked Jenna. Nodding yes, Jenna smiled and looked at Tabitha with a blush. 

Looking at themselves in the mirror, both girls were prepared. Blonde and auburn hair perfect, heavy goth makeup, and unadorned by any type of jewelry. Holding hands for just a minute, Tabitha and Jenna looked at themselves. Two beautiful young witches, the future looked promising. Armed with a new spell book, and smiling at each other they knew they were prepared for anything.  

===

"Well, you ready Jen?" Tabitha asked, looking at her best friend. Jenna smiled, nodding yes and biting her lip. Both girls left the restroom and headed for the bedroom where the heavy hooded cloaks were laid out. 

"You first," Tabitha giggled. Jenna giggled back and unclasped her bra, sliding it off. Tabitha watched Jen and noticed just a little how her big tits looked bruised and had hickeys on them, but didn't say anything. The memory of what she had done to her best friend the previous night still out of her grasp. 

As Jenna slid her panties off Tabitha began to strip as well. Both girls completely shaved down below now, they chalked it up to the heavy drinking again. Getting the cloaks over their naked bodies, Tabitha and Jenna looked at each other, with a smile. 

"This is going to be good," Tabitha said. Jenna nodding in agreement. 

The girls headed down to the basement, naked save the cloaks and hoods. Then they headed to the chamber under the basement. The air was noticeably colder down there, and both of them shivered. Tabitha with her tummy doing turns from excitement and Jenna feeling a bit scared. 

They stopped and looked at the altar, the soft candlelight flickering. The chamber cast in shadows and the air positively cold. Both girls shivering, Jenna biting on her lip nervously as Tabitha took out the spell book. Her grandmother's spell book. Of the sun and moon necklaces neither girl had a memory, and their absence from the cabin went unnoticed. 

Skimming over the pages Tabitha found the love spell, and read through it to herself, skipping over the part about needing a talisman from the object of the spell. Looking at Jenna she said, "I got this Jen Jen, you ready?" 

Nodding yes, Jenna said, "What do we do first?" Tabitha pointed to the floor in front of the stone altar and said, "Let's kneel there, and I'll start the spell." 

The girls both walked to the altar and slowly kneeled down. Their hoods up and their heads bowed down. As Tabitha began the reading, slowly and carefully, she got to the smudged part from her earlier accident with the coffee, and tried to say what she thought were the right words. And that was her last and worst mistake. 

As she went on, a mist began to form, across from the girls and over the stone altar. Jenna looked up and her mouth dropped. As Tabitha read the final words, a low chuckling came out of the fog, as it thickened and swirled. Tabitha gasped and Jenna's eyes widened in terror. The ritual complete, the next step had begun. 

As Tabitha dropped the book, Jenna screamed in horror. Tentacles, slimy and wet came from the mist, quickly and before either girl could react. Jenna froze in shock as the slimy tentacles wrapped around Tabitha. Around her wrists, and her ankles, lifting her and spreading her limbs wide apart. More tentacles shot out from the mist, the ends grabbing with claw like appendages. Grabbing and yanking, ripping the cloak from Tabitha's body. Stripping her as she screamed. 

"Jenna! Reverse the spell!" Tabitha screamed. The tentacles lifting her now naked body in the air. "Read it backwards!!" she squealed. The tentacles wrapping up her legs and around her slim waist. Each wrists and ankle gripped tightly and spread as Tabitha struggled and fought. The chuckling coming from the mist seemed to fill the room now. 

Jenna knelt down and picked up the book, looking from page to page in a panicked hurry. At last finding the love spell she quickly found the end of it. She was not nearly as practiced at this sort of thing as Tabitha, so as she tried to read it backwards and as Tabitha screamed, Jenna stuttered over the words. Missing one, then the third, then again at the ninth. Trying to read the words quickly and decipher them backwards, Jenna was failing utterly. The chuckling growing in volume, filling the chamber now with a throaty laugh. 

Looking up at Tabitha, Jenna stopped trying to undo the spell. The two girls locked eyes, Jenna's blues and Tabitha's green. For just an instant and just the space of a deep breath. Then Tabitha's screams were cut short as the tentacles yanked. Tabitha's naked body pulled quickly out of sight into the mist covering the altar and the end of the chamber. Jenna whimpered, then gasped. Then screamed. 

Hands, clawed hands, gripped her arms from behind her. The skin black as ebony, and covered in tough scales. Sliding down Jenna's arms and pulling her wrists up, one clawed hand gripped both her wrists together and pulled. Holding her arms up, and lifting her body until she was standing on her pretty pink painted toes. The other clawed hand gripped her cloak and as Jenna gasped, screamed, and struggled, ripped it off her naked body. 

Exposing her and holding her up by her wrists onto her tiptoes, the demon then reached around and groped Jenna's big tits. Pulling the nipples taut and twisting them. Her screams bringing chuckles from behind her. Deep throaty chuckles full of malice and sadistic intent. Then the Beast spoke, his voice a deep bass rumble full of gravel and spite. 

"What have we here, a fledgling witch, so young and vital," the demon said, as his clawed hand squeezed and lifted Jenna's big tits. His other clawed hand easily keeping her wrists held together and her body lifted onto tiptoes. "Such folly in you, such foolishness," he went on, by this time his claw tracing down Jenna's flat tummy. Then as Jenna screamed, the demon reached between her legs and slid one long finger into her newly bald slit. Pushing it in and wiggling it around. 

"Ah yes, your sacrifice was very pleasing to me, as was your summoning," he said. As his long finger explored Jenna's soft insides. Wiggling and then moving in circles deep in her channel, holding her up by her wrists. 

"Your friend is a fool, just like her ancestors throughout history," he explained, as he began finger fucking Jenna with two long thick fingers. Her squeals and gasps high pitched and desperate. "So many of her brood have attempted to bind me, so many times," the demon explained, as he held his long fingers deep in Jenna's tight pussy. Making her groan, making her scream and making her...wet. Against her will the demonic influence brought her arousal to a fever pitch, as he began pumping her with his evil digits. 

"Despite their best 

efforts to bind me, it is they that have been bound, over and over again throughout time," he went on. Chuckling as he held Jenna up by her dainty wrists, her feet just leaving the ground. Held up and held in place by his fingers impaling her slit. "BEHOLD!" he exclaimed. 

The mist and smoke filling the end of the chamber cleared. Just a little bit, just enough. Her blue eyes widened in shock and horror as Jenna indeed beheld her best friend Tabitha. Tabitha's naked body held suspended and stretched in an X shape by the tentacles wrapped around her wrists and ankles tightly. The origin of the appendages shrouded in what remained of the mist at the other side of the unholy stone altar. 

Jenna and Tabitha locked eyes, and if she was able to, Tabitha would've screamed at the sight of the demon holding her best friend up by her wrists and plunging its horrid fingers into her wet slit repeatedly. As it was, Tabitha had her own problem. Namely, the thick slimy tentacles probing her own wet slit and sliding up her tight ass. The only thing keeping her from screaming to the high heavens was the long slimy tentacle wiggling its way down her esophagus. 

Jenna watched in horror as Tabitha was held suspended, tentacles wrapping and encircling her best friend's pale skin. Probing Tabitha everywhere, and slipping into her. Undulating and pulsing with grotesque tremors as they fucked the poor girl's every tight hole. Wrapping around her breasts and squeezing them, the ends of several of the tentacles opening into sucking maws, attatching themselves to her nipples, her clit, her flesh, and suckling. 

The demon X'har chuckled and pulled his wet fingers out of Jenna, then plunged them into his fang filled mouth. Sucking them clean, saying, "Such divine nectar, so sweet and innocent, you shall be mine forever." 

Jenna finally found the wherewithal to scream as he let her arms down, tugging them behind her back as he stood behind her and holding her elbows together. Leaning Jenna forward and kicking her legs apart, so her big tits were pushed out and her feet were on tiptoes. Jenna's pink nipples like two bullets, pointing out and down, as she felt the horror of a thick, demonic cock, teasing up against her wet bald pussy. Again she screamed, as the thickness slipped in, just the tip, and she could feel it pulse with a demonic heartbeat. 

Tabitha watched, tears streaming down her face as the tentacles plunged and invaded her body, while her best friend Jenna was held in place, tits jiggling as she screamed, and the long veiny thickness slowly impaled her tight pussy deep. Then both girls locked eyes again, and the horrid sexual aberration began in earnest. 

"Such lovely creatures are young, nubile witches," X'har said exhultantly, as he held Jenna by her elbows and slowly fucked her. Savoring every inch of her tight young cunt, making her feel every vein as he slid in and out of her. Grinning at Tabitha, enjoying the sensation of plunging into Jenna while he made her watch her best friend being used in every way by the multitude of slimy, pulsing tentacles. 

"Such foolishness in young spellcasters, such folly, such hubris," he continued. Punctuating each word with a hard and deep thrust into Jenna, making her squeal with each one. Her body glistening with the strain even in the supernatural cold of the subterranean chamber. The candles flickering and Tabitha long since given up to resisting the fucking the tentacles were giving her. 

"Reap the rewards of your pride, young necromancers, reap the benefits of your knowledge," X'har said with a final bellowing laugh. And with one final deep thrust, he began filling Jenna's womb with his demonic seed. Cumming into her deep, the foul emissions from his cock thick and copius, filling her up and making her insides burn. Her screams echoed up the stairs and through the cabin into the woods. 

At the same time, the end of each tentacle buried in Tabitha's ass, pussy, and mouth, began to ooze their own final reward. Filling her up until her tummy was full and bloated. Her eyes half shut in exhaustion and her body bruised and sore in every place. Filling Tabitha up with the foul cum from demonic and debased origin, in an unnatural mockery of the insemination Jenna was undergoing. The two girls locked eyes once more. Jenna's blues and Tabitha's greens, as the mist finally enveloped them, and all faded to black. 

The realtor looked around, as she showed the cabin to the last prospective buyer. Pam Sims had been selling places like these for many years. Estates and property that had been on the market after the owners had moved away or passed away. But none had given her the chills like this place. 

Her skin crawled everytime she set foot inside the cabin, and each and every time she couldn't leave fast enough. She was glad this was the last showing of the day, and resolved to drop the cabin from her listings whether it sold or not. 

The potential buyer, a tall raven haired beauty that only gave her name as Miss Kessler, hadn't said much. Only saying she loved the location and only grinning when Pam had shown her the cellar. Looking around and nodding, Miss Kessler remarked how perfect the cellar was, even as she paid special attention to the shelves in the corner and a large wooden chest on the floor. 

As Pam showed Miss Kessler the back of the property, fenced in and ringed by trees, Miss Kessler said at last, "This place seems nearly perfect, I think it would be a great place to spend my vacations away from the noise of the city." 

Pam could only quietly agree that it was a serene getaway, as Miss Jane Kessler noticed at the very back of the yard, the statues. Walking to the backside of the property, slightly hidden by a grove of brush, the statues became more obvious. 

"Yes, don't worry Miss Kessler. Should you purchase this property we can easily have those horrid things removed. They really do give me the creeps," Pam said with a shiver. Looking away. 

"Oh no," Jane Kessler said. "They are quite simply amazing, I would insist you leave them. And I've made up my mind, I will take this property immediately. I believe the paperwork will be minimized by the fact that this will be a cash only transaction?" she asked Pam. 

Pam positively beamed at the sound of that, and as she walked back to the car with Miss Kessler she took one last look back at the cabin and shivered. Thinking of the statues. The four statues nearly hidden in the back. The four clean, alabaster and granite wrought statues that looked as if they were chiseled only yesterday. 

Two young nubile women, cast in ivory white stone and 

perfect in every way. Naked, on all fours, facing each other. Lips locked in a passionate kiss, white stone tongues pressed together. Each one with a single tear drop from the left eye. Each body perfectly molded in the pure white stone, one with a sun carved onto the small of her back, the other one with a moon. 

And the other two statues, also wrought perfectly in black granite. Their black bodies muscular, and grotesque in their beauty. Long forked tongues out, lascivious and obscene. Cloven hoofs, and each with horns crowning their brows. Each one holding the hips of the alabaster statue on her hands and knees in front of them. Each of the pair of them, with solid and thick black granite cocks, buried in the alabaster wrought cunts of the girls in front of them. Buried deep. Buried for all eternity.
