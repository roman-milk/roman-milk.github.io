Casandra's Guy
==============
#1 

===

I met Cassandra in college during my sophomore year. I'd seen her around campus since my first day as a freshman, but our paths had never crossed. One night I was at a party and there she was, surrounded by a platoon of male admirers. We made eye contact, I smiled, she looked away and I went and got myself another beer. 

I was outside on the back patio catching a breath of fresh air. It was a clear night and I was looking up at the stars when a voice behind me said, "Which one do you think I should have named after me?" 

I turned and saw Cassie standing there. "Which ever one is the brightest of course," I said. 

She smiled at me and said, "Why haven't I met you?" 

"We don't seem to travel in the same circles." 

"I saw you looking at me inside. Why didn't you come over and introduce yourself?" 

It was my turn to smile at her and so I gave her my biggest and brightest and said, "I can't stand crowds." 

She stuck out her hand and said, "Hi, my name is Cassandra, but my friends call me either Cassie or Cass." 

We talked for a bit and then I asked her out, she accepted and so began my on again, off again relationship with the woman who would one day end up as my wife. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Cassie and I dated off and on for about three months before deciding that we should give it a go as a steady couple. Three months into our steady relationship I arrived at Cassie's sorority house to pick her up for a planned evening out. One of her sorority sisters handed me a note that Cassie had left for me and it said that something had come up and she would call me the next day. I went out, had dinner and caught a show. After the show I decided to stop and have a drink and I went into a place just down the street from the movie house. 

I was sitting at the bar sipping a Coors Lite when I heard a familiar laugh behind me. I turned and saw Cassie sitting in a booth holding hands with some guy. Somebody dropped a few quarters into the jukebox and when the music started Cassie and the guy got up to dance. He pulled her close, she tucked her head into his chest and he dropped his hand to her ass and I saw her smile as his hands moved over her ass while they swayed to the music. 

I finished my beer, got up and left. I am a somewhat curious kind of guy so I drove over to the sorority house, parked and waited. Seven in the morning came and Cassie still hadn't come home. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was in my apartment when Cassie called, but I let the machine pick up the call. I went out that evening and when I came home at three in the morning the machine had three more calls from Cassie on it, all of them asking me to call. I let the machine take four calls from her on Sunday and it wasn't until Monday afternoon that we connected. 

I had two hours to kill before my next class and I was sitting in the student cafeteria sipping coffee and reviewing my notes from my last class when Cassie dropped into the seat across from me. I looked up at her and then back down at my notes. When I didn't say anything Cassie said, "I've been trying to reach you all weekend. Where have you been?" 

"Out trying to drown my sorrows." 

"That sounds pretty serious. Dare I ask?" 

"I saw my girl in a bar Friday night. She was dancing real close with some guy and didn't seem to care at all when he dropped his hand to her ass and left it there. In fact, she smiled and buried her head in his chest when he did it. But even though it didn't seem to bother her, it bothered me. Hence, I've been drowning my sorrows." 

"I can explain baby." 

"No you can't Cassie. You had a date with me and you stood me up to go out with another guy. There just isn't any good explanation for that. 

I looked at my watch, "Got to go. Time for my next class" and I got up and left her sitting there. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Cass was sitting on my doorstep when I got home that night. "Can I come in? I'd like to talk." 

I shrugged and stepped aside to let her in. I motioned for her to take a seat and then I sat down and motioned for her to go ahead. 

"First off Bob, you don't own me." 

I didn't say anything, just sat and watched her. 

"I know that we are going steady, but I'm young and when I meet someone I think I'd like to get to know better I'm going to want to go out with him. I'm not ready for marriage sweetie and I want to look around while I can. What's wrong with that?" 

"Not a thing Cass. It is the way you did it. You had a date with me. I had reservations made for dinner and I had already purchased the tickets for the movie so we wouldn't have to stand in a long line. All of that went into the toilet when you stood me up. You want to date other guys - fine - that's your choice, but make a date with another guy and then fuck over me to keep it? No fucking way Cassie. Speaking of fucking, did you fuck him?" 

"Don't be silly." 

"What did you do?" 

"We had dinner and then went to the bar and had some drinks and danced and then we sat in his car and talked for a while. He had me back to the sorority house by midnight." 

I stood up and walked over to the door, opened it and turned to her, "Leave Cassandra. Just get your lying ass out of here." 

"I'm not lying Bob." 

"Oh yes you are Cassandra. I was curious about you and your date so when I left the bar I drove over to the sorority house and waited for you to come home. I was still sitting there waiting for you at seven in the morning before I finally accepted the fact that you were probably in his bed and gave up waiting. Get out Cassandra. It is bad enough that you did it to me, but I'll be fucked if I'm going to sit here and be lied to." 

"Bob, I swear..." 

"Out Cassandra, just get the fuck out!" 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Three weeks went by and one day I came home from class to find Cassie sitting on my doorstep again. She wanted to talk so I let her in. We sat down and she said, "I've missed you. I know I screwed up honey and I'm sorry. Not seeing you for these three weeks has made me realize that you're my guy. Can we work it out honey? Can we put it back together?" 

She was gorgeous, she was a fantastic piece of ass and I was so in love with her that I couldn't think straight when she was around so I forgave her and we got back together and in doing so I planted the seeds of what would come back later to haunt me. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was four months before it happened again, but Cassie had learned. She called me on a Thursday and told me that she had met a guy who "was really cute" and she wanted to get to know him a little better and she had agreed to go out on a date with him. 

"We don't have anything planned for this weekend so I told him I would go out with him Saturday. I just wanted you to know so that you don't think that I'm sneaking around behind your back." 

Things were a little 'chilly between us for the next couple of weeks, but eventually I let her persuade me that it was me she really loved and things smoothed out. Cassie did that to me six more times before we graduated and each time we ended up back together. I guess that I was pussy whipped - Cassie was that good. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

A month before graduation (and two months after her last little "walk about") Cassie asked me when I was going to get around to asking her to marry me. I might have been pussy whipped, but I wasn't stupid. 

"I hadn't planned on asking you to marry me." 

Cassie sat there and looked at me with a stunned expression on her face. "What? But I thought we had something going for us. I thought that you loved me." 

"I do Cassie, but being in love doesn't automatically mean that I have to be stupid. I'm not about to marry a woman who always seems to find a really cute guy that she wants to get to know better. You have been doing that to me for as long as we have been keeping company and I love you so much that I always ended up forgiving you for it and staying with you. That was something that I could do as long as we were single, but there is no way I would put up with that if we were married and quite frankly, I don't think you will ever change." 

"You can't mean that baby. You know you are my guy. Sure I've checked out other guys, but isn't that what a girl is supposed to do? Make sure that she picks the right guy before getting married? I've looked honey, and you're the best there is. You are my guy baby, the search is over." 

"That is what you are saying now Cass, but I've been through this too many times now. Each time I get the "You're my guy" speech and I say okay and let it go, but two or three months later you have another cute guy that you just have to check out. I don't believe that you are ever going to change and I'm not about to get married to a woman I can't trust." 

"Okay then, how about this. We live together for one year and see how it goes. I'm serious about this honey. You're my guy and I know it so just give me a chance to prove it." 

What could it hurt I thought and besides, I really did like having her around. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

We graduated, found jobs and set up housekeeping together. Everything seemed to be working out well for us and I began to think that maybe I was Cassie's guy after all. About six months into our arrangement the company sent me out of town for two days. The day I got back I went straight to the apartment from the airport and as I came in the front door the phone started to ring. The telephone answering machine took the call before I could get to the phone: 

"Hi Cassie, this is Daren. Hey listen, I had a great time last night and I'd like to do it again. Give me a call, okay?" 

He gave his number and hung up. I dropped my bags and walked over to the machine and looked down at it. Should I erase the message and not let Cassie know that I knew or leave it and see what happened? I opted for the latter and went into the bedroom and unpacked. 

When Cass got home I was in the kitchen and she came in and gave me a big hug and a kiss. "Welcome home Tiger. It's only five-thirty, but are you ready for bed?" 

"In a little while maybe. You have a message on the machine." 

Cass went over and hit the PLAY button and I saw her face cloud over when she heard the message. She looked over and saw me watching her, "It isn't what you are thinking honey." 

I just stood there and looked at her while the message played out. When it was over Cassie hit the DELETE button and then came over to me and put her arms around me. 

"It isn't what you think. One of the girls I work with asked me to stop after work and have a drink with her. You were gone and I didn't want to come home to an empty apartment so I said yes. While we were there she got a call from her boyfriend on her cell phone and she told him where we were and to come on over. He got there and we had a couple of drinks and then a friend of his came in, saw him and came over to join us. The four of us were sitting there talking when a band came in, set up and started to play. We had some drinks, I danced with both guys a couple of times and then I got up and left. He must have gotten my number from Sarah. Honest honey, that's all there was to it." 

I must have looked a little skeptical because she said, "Come on baby, give me some credit for brains here. If I were doing what you are thinking would I have given him my home phone number? No I would not have. I would have given him my cell phone number or my number at work. Come on baby, it's been two days now, take me to bed." 

It sounded reasonable so I put it out of my mind and forgot about it. The rest of the year went by quickly and Cassie again brought up marriage and so I asked, she said yes and we tied the knot. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

A year went by and Cassie and I were doing great. Our relationship was strong, we both had good jobs and we liked what we were doing. We had settled into a comfortable life style, bought a house, furnished it and fell into a routine. She stopped with the girls from work one night a week, usually on a Tuesday because that was the night I bowled. I played cards one night a week with my buddies, usually on a Thursday because that was the night Cassie played cards with her sorority sisters from college. The only other times she went out were the nights when I was out of town. On those nights rather than sit home alone she would have dinner with one or two of the girls she worked with. And then one evening I found out just how stupid I really was. 

I came home from work just in time to see Cassie grab her purse and head for the door. "We going somewhere?" 

"Not we honey, just me." 

"Where are you going?" 

"I've got a date." 

"You have a date?" 

"Yes. Sarah introduced me to a friend of her boyfriend and he asked me out." 

"You are serious? You are actually going on a date with another man? Cass, has it occurred to you that you are married now, not single and back in college?" 

"It will be all right honey, trust me" and she walked by me and out the door. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was sitting up waiting when she came home at three in the morning. "Oh, you're up. I expected you to be in bed." 

"Not hardly. We have some talking to do." 

"Oh well, all right. Come on, we can do it while I undress" and she headed for the stairs. I followed and sat on the bed and watched while she took off her clothes. 

"I want an explanation Cassie. I thought we had a good marriage and I would like to know why you just tossed it on the trash heap." 

I saw the hickey on her neck as the turtle neck sweater came off and I saw the love bites on her tits when her bra came off and I knew what I would find if I took the time to look at the crotch of her panties. 

"Don't be silly honey. I haven't thrown anything away. I'm here aren't I? You can always trust me to come home to you." 

"I can't believe the attitude you are taking. You are here, you came home, so it's all right?" 

"It always has been in the past. I mean you always sulk and pout for a while - I suppose that it has to do with ego or male insecurity - but we always end up back in each others arms. You're my guy baby, you've always known that." 

"That was different; we weren't married then." 

"Oh come on Robert. You know very well that I've been doing it since we got married and you have turned a blind eye to it." 

"No Cassie, I did not know." 

"Of course you did. You know full well what I do on Tuesday nights and some Thursdays and you know what I'm doing on the nights you are out of town. I know that you like to pretend otherwise because it soothes your masculine pride, but you know that you have known." 

"Have you forgotten why we lived together for a year Cass? It was to make sure that you were through with running around on me. Why would I have done that Cass if your running around was something that I was willing to suffer through?" 

"Baby, baby, baby. You know I was still doing it. You heard that message on the recorder and you let yourself believe what I told you even though you knew what was going on. Now come on and stop this foolishness and let's go to bed. I want you to make love to me." 

"Haven't you already had enough dick tonight?" 

"Don't be crude honey. Yes, I have had sex tonight, but now I want to be made love to." 

I walked over to the dresser and opened the drawer where Cassie kept her sex toys, grabbed a dildo and tossed it to her. "Here you go Cassandra, the only lover that you'll have in this house" and I left the room. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I spent an hour sitting in the living room just staring at the wall and shaking with anger and then I got up and went to the spare bedroom and tried to go to sleep. I tossed and turned a lot, but I finally did manage to fall asleep. When I woke up Cassie was in bed with me, one leg over mine and an arm around me. I pulled myself away from her and she woke up. 

"What are you doing here?" 

"I belong here. You are my guy and I'm supposed to be with you." 

"Horse shit Cassie. After the shit you pulled on me yesterday and what you admitted to last night when you got home this marriage is over and I don't want you anywhere near me." 

"Don't be silly honey. I love you and you know I do and I know that you love me. The fact that I need a little something different once in a while doesn't mean that I don't want to be married to you. Come on honey, let's start the day out right, make love to me." 

"Cassie, give it up! We are through. I don't know how you got it in your head that I knew what you were doing and that I was giving you tacit approval by not bringing it up, but you are wrong. I did not know and had I known this farce of a marriage would have been over long ago. Now just leave me the fuck alone" and I got up to take my shower and get ready to go to work. 

When I came downstairs Cassie was waiting for me. "Honey, please, we need to talk." 

"We talked Cassie, we talked when you got home last night and I heard more than enough and I didn't like any of it." 

I grabbed my briefcase and went to work. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Fortunately I was in the end stages of a project and I was able to lose myself in my work that day and not have to spend time thinking of Cassie and our dead marriage. I had thought about it on the way to work and again on the way home and I had begun to make a mental list of the things that I was going to have to do. 

Cassie wasn't home when I got there and I sat down at the kitchen table and began to write down all the things that I had come up with. Find a divorce lawyer, find a realtor to sell the house, close out all joint accounts, etc., etc., and I was debating on whether or not to cancel the life insurance policy I had on Cassie when I heard the front door open and Cassie call out, "Honey, I'm home." Big fucking deal I thought and I went back to my list. 

Cassie came into the kitchen and I looked up to see her smiling at me. "Hi honey" and she bent to kiss me and I turned my face away from her and she frowned. 

"Come on honey, don't be like that. You know you love me. It will work out; it always has. I've thought about it all day and I think I have finally figured out what the problem is. I don't know why I didn't see it sooner; it was right there in front of me all the time. You feel left out. Well I've taken care of that honey." 

The doorbell rang. "Here he is now. A little early, he must be eager. Come on honey, let's go welcome our guest." 

She headed off to answer the door and I just sat there shaking my head. It didn't seem to matter what I said to her or how forcefully I said it, in her mind everything was okay because she just knew that I loved her and that I knew that she loved me. I got up to go see what she was up to now. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

She was leading a tall good looking man toward the kitchen and she said, "Bob, this is Paul. Paul, this is my husband Bob." 

The man stuck his hand out; caught by surprise and not knowing what else to do I took it and we shook hands. 

"Paul has been after me for about a month now so today I called him and asked him over. I know this is sudden and that you weren't expecting it, but I'm sorry about having left you out for so long and I wanted to get a quick start on making it up to you. I know that this is all new to you and you may want to ease into it. You may only want to watch the first time or two or you may want to just jump right in. There isn't any pressure honey, just do what you want. Come on Paul" and she took him by the hand and headed off toward the bedroom. 

I just stood there and stared at her back as she walked away with Paul. I'd spent two and a half years with her in college, lived with her for a year and had been married to her for just a little over a year. After all that time you would think that I would know her pretty well, but it was now obvious that where she was concerned I really did not have a clue.  

===

And it seemed that she didn't know me any better than I knew her. How could she possibly think that I could accept what she was doing? Where did she get the idea that just because she said she loved me and that she knew that I loved her that everything was okay? And just where in the hell had the idea that all that was wrong was that I felt left out come from? Did she really think that I was going to follow her and her lover, boyfriend or whatever he was to the bedroom? 

I grabbed my coat and was headed for the door when I heard Cassie shout, "Oh Jesus yes, just like that, just like that" from the bedroom. I don't know why, but all of a sudden curiosity got the best of me and I headed for the bedroom. 

Paul was lying on his back and Cassie was working her way up and down on the biggest cock I had ever seen on a human being. 

"God, I've never been so full" she moaned, "I'm going to be stretched out of shape for a week." 

She rocked back and forth and moved up and down and moaned in pleasure, "Oh yes, oh yes, oh god yes. Don't stop baby, don't lose it, don't lose it, work with me baby work with me, stay with me, stay with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" and she had the strongest orgasm I'd ever seen. 

Paul gripped her and rolled with her ending up on top and then he started pounding her pussy to reach his own climax. Cassie moaned and grunted as he slammed into her and just as he said, "Here it comes baby, here it comes" Cassie had another large orgasm. Paul rested on his hands for a couple of moments and then he lifted himself off of Cassie and fell to the bed next to her. 

A minute passed and then Cassie sat up and smiled at me. The she got on her hands and knees with her ass toward me. 

"Come on honey, make love to me while I get Paul hard again." 

I should have turned and run screaming from the room, but I didn't. I had been fascinated by the sight of Cassie riding that huge cock and the sounds that she had made while doing it. Also, her cunt had looked like I could have put my clenched fist into it when Paul had pulled out and for some perverse reason that I couldn't understand I wanted to - no, I had to - see what it felt like to follow that huge piece of meat into her. 

As I undressed I watched her put both hands around Paul's cock and lean down and take it in her mouth and I wondered if she would choke to death when it got hard. I moved up behind her and put my hands on her hips and pushed my cock into her cunt. It was hot and it was wet and it felt good, but there was no way in hell that I was ever going to be able to cum fucking her pussy - there just wasn't any friction. But my cock was hard and after being drug into this affair I wasn't going to leave the room without cumming and Cassie's mouth was full so I went for the only other available option - her asshole. 

Cassie had never liked anal sex, but that was just tough shit (pardon the pun) as far as I was concerned. I had a hard on and she only had one hole available that was tight enough to get me off and besides, I wasn't all that happy with her right then anyway. I didn't give her any advance notice; I just pulled my cum covered cock out of her pussy, lined it up with her anal rosebud and then pushed. Cassie screamed, but it wasn't all that loud because she had her mouth full of Paul's cock. I suppose I should have warned Paul so Cassie wouldn't bite off his dick, but I didn't owe him anything and he had gone after Cassie knowing that she was married. 

Whatever, when I pushed in and she screamed she tried to pull her mouth off of his cock, but he grabbed her head with both hands and wouldn't let her go. It took me three or four strokes to get myself all the way into her ass and she screamed and groaned and tried to pull away from me, but I held on tight and wouldn't let her go. I had a good grip on her hips and I held on tight as I started banging away at her ass as hard as I could. Cassie's screams turned into moans and groans and she kept trying to pull away and that only made me try to fuck her harder and faster. Then, about three or four minutes into it Cassie started a long, low moan and she stopped trying to pull away. In another minute she was actually pushing back at me and the thought of her responding excited me enough to push me over the edge and I came. My cock started to go soft and I didn't want it to. I wanted to stay in Cassie's ass and from the way she was pushing back at me I think that she wanted it to. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

But my cock didn't stay hard and when I pulled out of Cassie's ass I immediately started wondering just what the hell I was doing taking part in Cassie's sick little sexcapade. That wasn't the kind of guy I was. Why was I letting her pull me down to her level? 

I saw that she had a good three inches of Paul's cock in her mouth and she was jacking him off with both hands. I shook my head in disgust and started gathering up my clothes. Cassie had Paul hard and was ready to take him on again and when she pulled her mouth off of him she saw me getting ready to leave. 

"Where are you going Bobby?" 

"Anywhere away from here." 

"No honey, go and wash yourself. I want you in my mouth while Paul stuffs me again." 

When I heard that I snapped! I'd had enough. I dropped my clothes on the floor and walked back over to the bed. I grabbed a handful of Cassie's hair and pushed my dirty, slimy, shit-coated cock into her mouth, "You want it clean you fucking whore, you clean it." 

I held her head with both hands and started fucking her face as Paul got up and got into position to take Cassie from behind. As soon as he pushed into her my whore of a wife gave a moan and started pushing her ass back at him. In less than a minute she was so lost in being fucked by that huge cock that she had forgotten all about how filthy my cock was and began sucking on me. I let go of her hair and stood there wondering at the sluttishness of it all. Paul was pounding away at Cassie and he looked at me, "You sure have one hot sex maniac here. I wish my wife was like her." 

"You're married?" 

"Yeah, to the hottest looking, coldest fish in town. I prowl because I can't get any at home." 

I wondered which of us really had it the worst: Me with a wife who did too much or him with a wife who did too little. At least in his case, if she wasn't fucking him she probably wasn't out fucking everybody else. My thoughts were interrupted by Cassie taking her mouth off me and telling Paul that she wanted to be on top. Then she turned to me and said, "I want you in my ass honey. I want Paul in my pussy and you in my ass at the same time." 

Good God, I thought, just how depraved is this woman that I married? Still, the idea of being in her ass again did appeal to me so I got on the bed and moved behind her. It wasn't as easy to slide into her the second time as I'd thought it would be. Paul had her cunt stretched so tight that I not only had to fight the tightness of Cassie's ass, but the fact that his super large cock was pushing up at the thin membrane separating the two chambers and taking up some of the room. 

It was awkward trying to establish a rhythm with Paul and while the sensation of our two cocks rubbing together was weird on another level it was also extremely exciting. Even though our threesome had been Cassie's idea from the groans she was making I didn't think she was enjoying it all that much and that thought made me happy. In fact, it made me so happy that I started banging into her butt harder to try and add to her discomfort. Banging into her harder however caused me to climax faster and it wasn't long before I sent my second load of the night to join the first in Cassie's ass. 

As soon as my limp cock was out of Cassie's ass and I was off the bed Paul rolled her over and got on top. Cassie's legs came up and locked around him and I gathered up my clothes and left the room while Paul pounded into her and she cried out in pleasure. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

In the spare bedroom I laid on the bed and stared up at the ceiling and wondered why I hadn't stuck to my guns when I told Cassie that I hadn't planned on asking her to marry me. I knew then what she was so why had I let her convince me that marriage would change her? Was she right when she said I knew all along what she was doing? Had I been pushing the knowledge deep down into my subconscious where it would remain hidden so I wouldn't have to confront her? Was she right when she said that it didn't matter because I knew that she loved me and that I knew that I loved her? Did I really? 

And what about our night? The ease with which Cassie had handled it told me that it hadn't been the first time that she had been with more than one man. As for the threesome itself, part of me was disgusted with myself for having done it and lowering myself to her level, but part of me had been loved seeing that huge cock of Paul's being swallowed by Cassie's little pussy. And what about my not wanting to leave her ass after I had come in it - my wishing that my cock would stay hard so I could stay there? I fell asleep to the sounds of Cassie begging Paul to fuck her and with a headful of questions that I didn't have any answers for. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I woke up the next morning with Cassie wrapped around me. As soon as I stirred I felt her hand slide down my body and take hold of my cock. 

"Good morning my love" she said, "How are you feeling this morning?" 

"Embarrassed." 

"About what?" 

"Taking part in what you did last night. I would feel better about myself if I had just taken my coat and left." 

"Don't say that honey, you had a good time, I know you did." 

"No Cassandra, what I had was an overwhelming curiosity to see if you could actually take the huge thing that Paul had without hurting yourself. Everything else happened because I had to stick around to see." 

Cassie giggled, "He was awesome, wasn't he. I had no idea that he was so well equipped when I agreed to see him." 

"Yeah, well you certainly seemed taken with him last night. You didn't even notice when I left the room. There is a bright side to this I suppose. He can be your fulltime boyfriend when I move out." 

"Damn it honey, stop talking like that. You are my guy and I'm not letting you go. As far as Paul is concerned he was a one-night stand. He was great and I would love to be able to play with him three or four times a week, but I can't do that because it wouldn't be fair to you." 

"What the hell does that mean?" 

"It means that if I kept seeing him you would never be able to make love to me again because you wouldn't fit any more. As it is you will probably have to settle for my ass and blow jobs for the next few days to give me time to tighten up." 

"What the fuck is wrong with you Cassandra? We are through!! The marriage is over and we are through, through, through!!!" 

"Don't be silly Robert. If we were through my hand would be holding a limp dick right now instead of a rock hard cock." 

I hadn't been paying attention to what her hand was doing while we were talking, but she was right, I was hard, and I didn't fight her off when she lowered her head and took me in her mouth. Neither did I run from the room when got on her hands and knees and said, "Go slow honey, I have to get used to this ass thing." 

The unfaithful cunt knew me better than I knew myself. As I slid my cock into her hot, tight ass she moaned and laid her head down on a pillow. About two minutes into the ass fuck she said, "Maybe once a month. What do you think honey, once a month?" 

"Once a month what?" 

"Maybe I could see Paul once a month. Would that be okay?" 

Fucking bitch I though as I pounded my cock into her tight ass. I guessed I'd better get used to using it. Report_Story
