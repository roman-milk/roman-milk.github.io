* 

He had gone by many names. Saint Nicholas. Kris Kringle. Old Saint Nick. If anyone asked, he said that he preferred simply being called Nick. Many people doubted his existence, but he was definitely real. He was the man who went by the name Santa Claus. 

He often laughed at the various depictions of him throughout the world. Most had him imagined as a jolly old fat guy with a puffy white beard. He was amused by the absurdity of this thought. If he was ageless, why would he be old? Nick was in fact quite young in appearance, and very much in shape. He was hundreds of years old and still maintained the appearance of a man around the age of thirty. He had been blessed in many ways. He was blessed to be ageless. He was blessed to have some abilities some would call magic. And he was blessed to be married to his lovely wife, Agatha Claus. 

They had met many years ago, and he knew it was love at first sight. She was very cute, and pleasantly plump, which was the fashion at the time. She was a hard worker and was very supportive of his job. She knew what she was getting into when she married him. Agatha became an invaluable part of his life and his job. Being chosen as his true love made her ageless as well, so they had been together for many years, bringing joy to millions. Nick was living a great life. 

Nick's job had evolved in many ways. What started as a small operation had become something greater. As more people believed in him, his operation became bigger. Now, Christmas was a big business. But describing it as a business made it sound so cold. It was a friendly, happy business, centered around bringing joy and the spirit of Christmas all over the world. Nick had never heard any complaints from his helpers. 

His helpers assembled the toys and gifts and they were all placed into Nick's magical bag, which held the gifts for everyone in the world. Giving these gifts to everyone in the world was the greatest part of his year. Well, he gave gifts to most people in the world. Only the people on the 'Nice' list received gifts. The people on the 'Naughty' list were another story entirely. 

Nick was dismayed to see that more and more people ended up in the 'Naughty' category every year. Nick thought the problem was they didn't have enough Christmas spirit. It was his job to leave them a stern reminder of their naughty ways and leave them a lump of coal in their stocking. His helpers retrieved the coal. It wasn't the best job in the world, but it was a necessary part of the Christmas process. 

The worst part of this job was leaving the coal for the people on the 'Naughty' list. This was why he generally took care of this first during his travels on Christmas, so he could end his night on a high note by giving gifts to those deserving. That was where Nick found himself now, on his sleigh, flying through the chilly, starry night. 

His sleigh was enchanted, along with his reindeer, enabling him to travel all over the world to every house in the span of one night and make it back to the North Pole in time for Christmas morning with Mrs. Claus. His helpers created the list, separating those who were nice from those who were naughty. Nick could read a quick summary on each person on the list, explaining why they ended up on the list they did. The easiest way to do his job was to go alphabetically, which was how he ended up, early in the night, at the house of Beatrice Adams. 

Nick checked his list to verify the facts before going inside. His sleigh kept him warm as he sat in the snowy night. He was dressed smartly in a crisp red suit, looking very handsome. He wore a red cap, as a nod to the many depictions of him. He glanced at the list. 

Beatrice Adams- 28, NAUGHTY: Bad Attitude, Has Stolen Money, Lied to Friends and Family, Has Been Intimate with Strangers, Has Been Intimate with Married Men, and generally not pleasant to be around. Very Little Christmas Spirit. NAUGHTY. 

Nick shook his head. This was not an unusual circumstance. The 'Naughty' list had gotten longer and longer. Christmas spirit was at an all time low. Even those who had Christmas Spirit sometimes didn't believe in him. When those people looked back at those presents marked 'From Santa', they figured it was from their parents, not him. It was disappointing to see his work unappreciated by so many. But those who did appreciate it made it all worthwhile. 

He stepped out of the sleigh, grabbed his bag, and made his way towards the chimney. Within moments he had made his way through and now stood into the warm interior of Beatrice's living room. He quickly glanced around, taking in his surroundings. She had a nice looking Christmas tree set up which was lit by white lights. 

He looked around for a stocking, but was unsurprised to find none. Nick started to walk towards the tree, reaching into the bag to find a lump of coal. His hand wrapped around a hunk of coal, and as he started to lift it out, a light flipped on. Nick jumped quickly, and looked back to see a woman staring at him. 

"Who are you?" said the woman, confused and a little scared. This must be Beatrice. She had a silk robe wrapped tightly around herself. Nick had to admit that she was very pretty. She had long brown hair and was tall and tan. Nick had only been caught a few times, so he was flustered. 

"I'm sorry." he said, "You weren't supposed to find me." 

"Are you robbing me?" Beatrice asked. 

"No, of course not." Nick stammered. 

"Then who are you?" Beatrice asked. 

"Well, I'm Santa Claus." Nick said, standing straight. Beatrice laughed out loud. 

"You're kidding, right? Do you think I'm an idiot?" Beatrice asked, less afraid, more defensive. 

"No, of course not. I am actually Santa. But you can call me Nick." Nick said. Beatrice just smiled brightly. 

"I'm gonna call the police." Beatrice said, walking towards her phone. 

"That won't be necessary." Nick said. Beatrice stopped. 

"Listen, Nick. Santa's an old, fat guy." Beatrice argued. 

"Don't believe everything you hear, Beatrice." Nick replied. Beatrice stared at him narrowly. 

"How do you know my name?" she asked. 

"Well, you were on the list." Nick replied. 

"Oh, a list, huh? Well, that proves everything. You couldn't just be some crazy stalker." Beatrice argued. 

"Beatrice, I can prove it." Nick argued. 

"How?" Beatrice replied. 

"Give me the name of one of your friends. I'll tell you what they want on the list." Nick argued, pulling the book that contained the list out of his pocket. 

"Okay, fair enough. How about Veronica Decker?" she asked. He skimmed the list and found her name. He read through her description. 

"Well, she's on the naughty list." Nick replied. 

"I bet she is." Beatrice said with a smirk. "Am I?" 

"Yes." Nick replied simply. For some reason, this made her smile. 

"What are you gonna give me? A piece of coal?" Beatrice asked. Nick pulled his hand out of the bag, holding a lump of coal. She laughed. 

"Okay, either you're really committed to your story, or you're the real deal. What else do you have in the bag?" she asked, curious. 

"I have the gifts for all the people on the nice list." Nick replied. 

"Don't you think I deserve a little something nice? I've been a good girl." Beatrice asked. 

"Well, according to my list, you have been naughty." Nick explained. 

"What does it say I did?" she asked. 

"Well, it says you've had a bad attitude, you've stolen money, you've lied. And you've had relations with strangers and married men. Among other things." Nick said. 

"Well, that's fair. But with a body like this, it's hard not to be getting laid." Beatrice said with a laugh. 

"Well, just cause you can do something doesn't mean you should." Nick said. 

"Whatever." Beatrice said, rolling her eyes. "I still don't believe you're actually Santa. Any of that stuff you said could be found by any crazy stalker." 

"Well, do you want to see the reindeer?" Nick asked. This caused Beatrice to raise her eyebrow. Nick started walking towards the front door. Beatrice considered this proposal and decided that if he was bluffing she would call it. 

"Okay. Show me your reindeer." she said, slipping on some slippers. Nick opened the door and led her outside. She rubbed her arms to keep herself warm as she followed him out. He walked halfway down the front walk, before turning around and gesturing towards the roof. She stood next to him and turned around, looking up at the roof. There stood nine reindeer and Santa's sleigh, waiting for Nick to return. Beatrice's eyes widened. She turned to Nick. 

"Holy Shit! You're Santa Claus!" Beatrice exclaimed, finally realizing the truth. 

"I told you." Nick replied. "C'mon, let's get back inside. I don't want you to catch a cold." Nick said, gesturing her to go back inside. They both quickly returned to the warm confines of Beatrice's home. Beatrice was still in awe. 

"Holy Shit! I mean, wow. I didn't think you were real." Beatrice said. 

"I know you didn't." Nick replied. "I hope I've changed your mind." 

"You did! Just wow. So, how do you do it?" Beatrice asked. 

"I have some powers some would call magic or supernatural." Nick said. "But, I am on a schedule. So I should get going if I want to make breakfast with the Mrs." 

"Wait, I have so many questions. So there is really a Mrs. Claus?" Beatrice asked. 

"Yes, of course. I have a picture actually. Our 150th anniversary is coming up soon." Nick said, pulling out a picture of Agatha before handing it to Beatrice. 

"She must really like her breakfasts." Beatrice mumbled to herself, taking in Agatha's plump shape. 

"What?" Nick inquired. 

"Nothing." Beatrice said with a bright smile. "So, are you ageless, or something?" 

"Yes, I have been blessed to never age. Me, and whoever the woman I love is, are ageless. It is wonderful to spend hundreds of years with your true love." Nick replied. 

"Wow, that's amazing." Beatrice replied. "So that bag has gifts for everyone? Is it all just toys, or what?" 

"No, there's gifts for both adults and children. Anyone that was on the 'Nice' list, did nice things, and believes in Christmas receives something from my workshop." Nick replied. 

"Well, you've convinced me. I've seen the error of my ways. Don't you think I deserve something nice?" Beatrice asked. 

"Well, if you can behave yourself, then maybe next year you'll end up on the "Nice' list." Nick replied, reaching back into his bag to retrieve the coal he had put back into his bag earlier. Beatrice pouted, demanding immediate satisfaction, but it seemed as if he was not going to budge. She looked Nick up and down, realizing he was actually very handsome. In her mind, he would be classified as a fucking hottie. He was tall and strong, and that crisp red suit flattered him. Plus, he had the ability to give a person anything they wanted, and he was ageless. That kind of power was very attractive. She decided to try a different tact. She saw Nick set the coal under the tree and stand straight back up. 

"Well, Beatrice, I hope you have a Merry Christmas. And I hope you learned your lesson. When I return next year I hope you're full of Christmas Spirit." Nick replied. 

"How about you fill me with Christmas Spirit right now?" Beatrice said. 

"What?" Nick replied, turning to face her. As he did, Beatrice slipped her robe off of her shoulders, revealing her nude form to him. He couldn't help but take a quick glimpse. He was Santa Claus, but he was still a man. Her breasts were quite large, larger than most. Her body seemed very firm and fit, and her shaved vagina was exposed to him as well. 

"What are you doing Beatrice?" 

"I'm showing you why I'm on the 'Naughty' list, Nick. Look at this body. Can you blame me for wanting to do naughty things? It's what I was made for. Who am I to deny it?" Beatrice replied. 

"The measure of a good person is being able to control their urges." Nick argued, frozen to the spot. 

"Oh, you're right. I'm a naughty girl. I'm a bad girl. But you like that don't you? Is that why you made so much noise, hoping to get caught? Hoping to get caught by a bad girl, and see what naughty things she's capable of." Beatrice added. 

"Of course not! Don't be ridiculous!" Nick argued. 

"I saw that picture of your wife. She's a little fat, don't you think?" Beatrice asked. 

"How dare you?" Nick replied. 

"Well, you've kept yourself in shape over the years. Don't you think she should have as well? She thought she was set, so she got lazy. She got fat and sluggish. Bad girls like me don't get lazy. We keep ourselves in shape for our men. But she didn't. What a shitty wife." Beatrice asked. 

"I can see that you'll never be on the 'Nice' list." Nick replied. 

"Oh, that's true. I'll always be a bad girl. It's funny, Nick, I've never heard any stories about Santa Claus having children. Do you have any kids?" Beatrice asked. 

"Well, uh, no, unfortunately, we have not been able to conceive." Nick replied, not understanding why he was still here. 

"Hmm, that's sad. A man who brings joy to millions of children can't have any of his own. It's been a 150 years, Nick. I think you can give up trying to have kids with her. Why not give it a shot with another woman?" Beatrice offered. 

"What?" Nick replied, stunned. 

"That's right. I'm offering everything. You can fuck me... any way you want. You can breed me... as many times as you want. Just make me your true love, and you can have everything you've ever wanted." Beatrice offered, approaching him. 

"I can't cheat on my wife." Nick replied. "Plus, you're a naughty girl." 

"I am, Nick, and yes you will cheat. Your wife can't possibly be any good in bed. I can just tell. You are one of the most famous men in history. You bring joy to millions. How much is it to ask to have a sexy wife willing to do all the things you want to do, and to have the children you've been desperate to have. You deserve it." Beatrice asked. 

"I have to go." Nick said, making his way to the chimney. Beatrice bounced over, and stood before the chimney, cutting him off. 

"I know you want to go to all those ungrateful, sniveling little brat's houses and give them toys that they won't appreciate because they are too greedy and spoiled. And you want to get home to your wife, who has done nothing to remain attractive to you? Why?" Beatrice asked. Nick was stunned, unable to speak. She stepped closer to him. 

"Nick, trust me. My milk and cookies are the best you'll ever have." She added. "Just look at me, Nick. Look at these tits." She said, cupping them in her hands, their soft flesh pouring through her fingers. They were capped by hard nipples. "These are double D's! The best around. They are so soft. Some have called them supernatural. And my pussy. My sexy, shaved pussy. It is unbelievably tight. Some have said it feels like magic. And my ass?" she started, before twirling around, exposing her full round ass to his gaze. "This ass has brought more cheer to people than you have! I think we're meant to be together." she added. 

Nick couldn't believe this. He had never been in a situation like this. Her naughtiness was bringing out a dark side in him. He had never seen a body like hers. He had to admit that her body blew his wife's body out of the water. Did Beatrice have a point? He had brought joy to millions. Didn't he deserve to take some time for himself, to take some real, personal joy in her hot body? What was he thinking? He was Santa Claus! He couldn't do this, could he? This girl was evil. She was on the naughty list. He could see her devilish smile as she faced him. There was no doubt how naughty she was. His eyes couldn't help but travel down. He couldn't control the thought that popped into his mind. Damn, look at them titties! 

Beatrice knew she had him in her clutches. Before he could react, she pulled him into a deep kiss, driving her tongue into his mouth. Beatrice's tongue was soon mashing against Nick's. She held his head in her grasp as they frenched. His hands naturally reacted by holding onto her hips. But a slut like her wouldn't be satisfied by that. She grabbed his hands in hers and guided them to her ass. On reflex, his hands squeezed her perfectly round ass cheeks. Nick and Beatrice French kissed a few minutes. Nick was consumed by the kiss, so Beatrice took advantage by lowering her hands to his zipper and unzipping his pants. She reached inside, and her hands wrapped around the root of what felt like a very large dick. She let his pants and underwear fall to the floor, revealing a huge, ten-inch penis. She pulled away from him. 

"Holy shit, Nick! You're huge! Come with me. I'm fucking you." Beatrice commanded, grabbing his dick, leading him to her bedroom by it. Nick was in a daze as he stepped out of his pants and followed her. As they entered her bedroom, she ripped off his suit coat, and lifted off his shirt, revealing his nude form to her eyes. 

"Nick, my goodness! You're a fucking hunk!" she said as she admired his fit form. She pushed him back, forcing him to fall to the bed. Nick didn't know how he got there. He had never been the type of guy to demand sex. He just didn't work that way. Sex simply didn't play a big part in his life. But he was transfixed by Beatrice's bouncing breasts as she crawled on top of him. Nick couldn't believe he had fallen under the spell of this naughty girl so easily. She reached down and grabbed his penis, pointing it at her vagina. 

"Merry Christmas." She said with a smug smile before lowering herself on him. Nick was in shock as her tight vagina squeezed his penis in just the right way. As he was completely buried inside her, he stared into her eyes. 

"How's that pussy feel, Nick? Do you like it? Don't you like being inside my tight little cunt?" Beatrice teased. She was right. It wasn't a vagina. What she had was a cunt. A tight cunt that was squeezing his dick perfectly. Beatrice started to bounce. 

Nick tried to fight the feelings she was bringing out in him. He wasn't supposed to be liking this. He was on the 'Nice' list every year. But with every bounce, he was feeling more and more naughty. His eyes opened and looked into hers. He was more animal than man at this point. He was seeing red. He flipped her over, wrestling with her until he was on top of her. He started to drive into her, asserting his control. 

Her tight cunt felt amazing. All he had ever experienced was Agatha's nice vagina. But this naughty pussy felt spectacular. It was doing things to his dick he didn't know were possible. Only a naughty pussy was capable of doing these things. 

"Haha, you've wanted this since you read my name on that list of yours. You knew how naughty I was, and you wanted a piece. Didn't you? Your naughty like me now, aren't you. You're on the naughty list now, aren't you? Tell me how much you love this. Tell me how much you need this." Beatrice whispered in his ear. 

"UHH, IT FEELS SO FUCKING GOOD!" Nick yelled out, before burying his dick inside her, releasing his seed in her fertile body. 

"That's it." she coaxed, "Fill me with that Christmas spirit. Give me those children you've been desperate to have." She came along with him, as she held his head tightly in her hands. After a minute, he rolled off of her, worn out from fucking this whore. What he just did ran through his head. He cheated on his wife! And it was with some whore off of the 'Naughty' list. What had he done? He had to get out of there. He rolled off the bed. 

"I need to go." he mumbled.  

===

"You're not gonna just leave me, are you?" Beatrice asked, stretching out like a cat. 

"I have work to do. I have to a lot of houses to get to." Nick said quietly, starting to get dressed. 

"Nick, look over here." Beatrice asked. Nick had been avoiding looking at her. He glanced at the bed. There was Beatrice, on all fours, her ass pointed at him with her hands pulling her cheeks apart, exposing her asshole. 

"What would make you feel better, Nick? Giving gifts to ungrateful people who probably don't believe in you, or showing one of your true believers how real you are by fucking her up the ass and having the best sex of your life." Nick stood there, stunned. "C'mon, Nick. I gave you the best sex you've ever had just minutes ago. Don't you think I deserve a reward?" Nick still didn't move, but his eyes were glued to her hot ass. "I've been a naughty girl, Nick. Don't I deserve a spanking? Teach me a lesson, Nick. Please?" she begged, moaning out her words. 

Nick looked at her with a mixture of hate and lust. He reared back and gave a perfect ass a hard spank. He watched her firm ass cheek jiggle and turn red as she moaned out loud in pleasure from the spank. She was a true whore. Nick dropped his pants and joined her on the bed again. He positioned his dick at her asshole and started to push. They both groaned out loud as he buried his dick in her ass to the root. He grabbed her hips and started to fuck her. 

"Fuck me Nick. Fuck me!" she yelled out. He reached under her and grabbed her firm breasts, squeezing them like he'd been aching to do. He pinched her nipples, causing her to moan out loud, and her asshole to clench around his dick. 

"You're not gonna be able to give this up, will you? You love me now. You realize that? You wouldn't be fucking me so hard if you didn't love me. You love me more than your fat wife? I'm capable of giving you all the things she never does. I have a part of your heart now. That makes me ageless, like you. Don't you get it? We can be together forever. You can have this body forever. It can all be yours. My ass, my tits, my pussy. They can be all yours. You want to marry me, and dump that ugly wife of yours. Don't you! Or are you too afraid that us being a couple would cause too much of a stir? That's okay. You can stay married to her, and keep up appearances. But I'll be with you, in the North Pole, a spoiled brat who you give gifts to throughout the year. You stay married to her, and I'll be there for you whenever you need me, which will be often. You'll have Mrs. Claus to take care of all the nice stuff, and you'll come to me for the nasty stuff. I'll be Mistress Claus!" she laughed out loud as she finished her speech. 

Nick drove into her harder at this last statement, causing her to moan out loud in orgasm, which caused him to reach his climax as well. He released more of his pent up seed deep inside Beatrice's ass. He collapsed to the bed, exhausted. She crawled off the mattress, and dragged his gift bag into her bedroom. 

"You don't mind if I go through this, do you?" she asked. 

"Take whatever you want." Nick said, not caring, knowing she deserved whatever she wanted for making him cum so hard. Nick fell into a light sleep as she fished through his bag. Within half an hour, she had retrieved some sexy swimsuits, some very fashionable clothes, and some incredibly expensive jewelry, including a huge diamond ring on her finger. She was having a very Merry Christmas. 

Half an hour later, Nick woke up in a panic. He was behind schedule. If he didn't get going, not everyone would have a Merry Christmas. He quickly moved to get dressed when Beatrice slowed him down. 

"Don't worry, Nick. It's okay. Listen, I went through your nice list. A lot of those women on that list are total bitches. And some of the guys are absolute pricks. None of them deserve a Merry Christmas. Just give them a lump of coal. It'll be okay." Beatrice said. Nick looked her still nude body. His only thought was how sexy she would look in one of those sexy Mrs. Claus outfits that some naughty women would wear. (The real Mrs. Claus would never wear such a thing, of course.) Beatrice was right. Nick would not be able to give her up. 

"Okay, that's fine. Are you ready to go?" Nick asked. Beatrice smiled wide at this. 

Within minutes, Nick and Beatrice were flying through the air on his sleigh. Beatrice was having the time of her life. Nick wondered what Mrs. Claus would think of this sexy woman arriving with her husband. She would never think Nick was capable of cheating. They could continue their affair for years without her knowing. This thought made Nick smile. He was now a permanent member of the 'Naughty' list. 

"Where to first?" Nick asked. Beatrice opened the list of names, and pointed at a pair of names, a husband and wife. The husband was on the 'Naughty' list, and the wife on the 'Nice' list. 

"I fucked this bitch's husband. You can't hold that against him, can you? Plus he had a big dick, so he deserves a present. And his wife is a total bitch. I don't care about all this nice crap she did. If she can't hold on to her man, she deserves a lump of coal." Beatrice said. 

"Whatever you say, Beatrice." Nick replied, realizing her knowledge of how the world really worked would be an invaluable tool in the future. His 'Naughty' and 'Nice' lists would never be the same with her in charge. She leaned over and whispered in his ear. 

"How hot would it be if Mrs. Claus wakes up to find a lump of coal in her stocking?" Beatrice whispered, her fingers tracing his hardening dick. She pulled away before he could respond. She stood up and walked to the edge of the sleigh. 

Beatrice had never been happier. Beatrice leaned over the edge of the sleigh, and yelled out into the night sky in joy. She was having a blast. She reached under her blouse and pulled it up her chest, exposing her massive breasts for the world to see. Nick didn't know if her nipples were hard from arousal or the cool night air. He didn't care, as long as he could see them. Beatrice yelled out three words into the night air. 

"Merry Christmas everybody!" 

She went back over to Nick, her massive breasts exposed. Nick couldn't take his eyes off of them. As she pushed a hardened nipple into his mouth, she brought her mouth to his ear, licked his earlobe, and whispered softly. 

"And more importantly, Merry Christmas to me."
