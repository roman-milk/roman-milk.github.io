Authors note: This story has two endings. I wrote the story and then my proofreader said it needed a different ending. Actually what she said that she saw the possibility of multiple endings, but I'm too lazy for that. But, since I have the screaming hots for the lady and want nothing more than to have her sit on my face I thought I'd better give her something to keep her happy. I do hope you enjoy. 

+++++ 

Mindy stood in front of the mirror and adjusted her veil for the tenth or eleventh time. She hated to admit it at this late date, but she wasn't at all sure she should do it. She wanted to do it, God knew that she loved Rob with all her heart, but the question was, "Should she do it?" Should she start her marriage to Rob on a lie? Rob was going to slip his ring on her finger believing that she was a virgin when the truth was that she was anything but. There would be a least - at least! - a half dozen sitting in the church and watching her walk down the aisle who had beaten Rob to what he thought he would be the first to get. 

She knew that Rob was the one the first time she laid eyes on him. Halfway through their very first date she was planning on how to fuck his brains out when he took her home. She would give him the best sex that of his life - so good that he would never want to leave her side. By the time they got to her apartment she had done a complete one-eighty. She dared not let him see how good she was in bed; he would think she was a slut and he would never see her again. All he would get on that first date was a quick kiss on the cheek and he didn't get much more on the next two. 

They did do some heavy petting on the fourth date, but when he put his hand on her breast she pushed it away even though her pussy was flooding and it was all she could do to keep from reaching for his cock. By the sixth date she had convinced herself that Rob would prefer a virgin bride and she reluctantly kept her legs closed to him. After he had asked her to marry him she had let him play with her breasts and she had even let him suck on them a couple of times. She had given him several hand jobs, but she had never let him get his fingers into her for fear that she would lose it and he would find out just how big a slut she was. 

Her pussy had been dripping all morning in anticipation of consummating the marriage and now here she was having serious doubts about whether she should even go through with the wedding. What would happen if Rob found out that she didn't go to his bed a virgin especially after she had denied him all these months? The more she thought about it the more certain she was that he would find out. She could think of two of her ex-lovers who were assholes enough to find some way to let Rob know that they had fucked his woman. 

Shit!!! She had built herself a cage and she was getting ready to step into it and have the door lock behind her. She couldn't do that to Rob, she just couldn't. She tore off her veil and threw it on the floor, grabbed her purse and headed out the back door of the church. She crossed the alley, putting a row of houses between her and the church, flagged down a cab and two hours later she was in her car and on her way out of town. 

+++++ 

Rob looked at his watch, took a deep breath and let it out. Forty minutes to go and he and Mindy would take the vows that would bind them together for the rest of their lives. He couldn't believe how lucky he was to find her. She was beautiful, sexy looking, intelligent, had a great sense of humor and she was a perfect match for him. He had known she was the one when he first was introduced to her. He hadn't thought he'd had a chance with someone that perfect and he had been both surprised and overjoyed when he asked her for a date and she said yes. 

He had spent almost all of that first date trying to make up his mind on how to handle the end of the evening. Should he try to score or not? He wanted her so bad that it hurt, but what if he made a move and it upset her? No, he couldn't take a chance on driving her away. He settled for a kiss on the cheek and the promise of a second date. He hadn't pushed it on the next two, but by the fourth date he felt he could try. As soon as he touched her breast he got shut down. After that they moved into doing some serious necking and that was about it until he asked her to marry him. 

Mindy was perfect and he was overjoyed that she was going to be his. Yeah, sure, overjoyed. So why was he so nervous and jumpy? Hell, he knew why. It was because she was a virgin. She was a virgin and that fact made him nervous as all hell. He remembered what happened to his cousin George. His wife Amy was one hot looking bitch and she looked like sex oozed out her pores and she had been a virgin when George married her and then when it was too late George found out that Amy believed that the only reason to have sex was to make babies and she wouldn't make love unless it was her fertile time. Then she got pregnant and said, "The job is done" and that was the end of sex for George. 

And then there was his buddy Tom. Marge was a virgin when Tom married her and according to Tom, even though she was always ready and willing she would only do it missionary, with the lights off and wearing a nightgown. Tom said the only time he even got to see her tits was when he caught her in the shower. 

George and Tom could have avoided all of that if they hadn't gone along with that, "I'm going down the aisle a virgin" story. Mindy was one hell of a sexy looking lady, but was it just sexy looking? Was she going to be sexless in the bedroom like George's wife Amy had been? It had taken him months before he got to play with Mindy's tits, but it never seemed to turn her on. She had given him a couple of hand jobs, but that didn't really tell him much. Once when she was stroking him off he had tried to gently push her head down toward his cock and she had come unglued. Did that mean that she wouldn't give head after they got married? He loved head, both giving it to his partner and getting it. No way he could see a marriage without oral sex. And what about anal? If she wouldn't do oral there was no way in hell she would even think about anal. 

He looked at his watch again - twenty more minutes. He thought of all the sex he'd had and how much he enjoyed all of it. Damn it!!! This was his future he was gambling on. No! No way! He couldn't do it. He loved Mindy, but he wouldn't live in a sexless marriage and since he had no way of knowing what might happen he wasn't going to chance it. He snuck out the back door of the church and when they came looking for him to tell him it was time he was in his apartment packing. 

+++++ 

Mindy was tired. She had been driving for almost five hours; add to that the emotional trauma of the last six hours and she was exhausted. She saw the sign that said there was gas, food and lodging at the next exit and she put on her turn signal and aimed her car up the exit ramp. The sign said food and gas to the right and lodging to the left and she figured she better get her a room first so she made a left turn and a hundred or so feet down the road was a Super 8 Motel. 

After she checked in she asked where the best place to eat was. She was told she had three choices. Bud's Bar at this end of town, Millie's Cafâ€š in the center of town and Benny's Tavern on the other end. Bud's served half pound ground rounds and steamed hot dogs, but that was all. Millie's was a regular restaurant, but didn't have a liquor license. Benny's Tavern was also a pizzeria. Mindy felt like pizza so she drove through town to Benny's. The place was packed. The guy at the motel hadn't mentioned the dance floor and the live band. 

She saw an open seat at the bar and she headed for it. As soon as she was seated the bartender was there asking what he could do for her. She ordered a Coors's Light and then asked if she could buy pizza by the slice. Told she could she ordered four slices of cheese and pepperoni. When he set the beer down in front of her he asked: 

"Are you alone tonight or are you with somebody?" 

"Why do you want to know?" 

"Tonight is what we call "Doe's Night." Unescorted ladies get their drinks at half price." 

"What's the reason behind that?" 

"It draws the single ladies and the single ladies draw the males - the Bucks." 

"Cute. Well I guess you can put me down as a Doe because I'm all alone." 

The bartender smiled at her as he said, "But you won't be for long. Not a pretty lady like you." 

She took a sip of her beer and looked around. There did seem to be a lot of single guys sitting at the tables. She wondered if one or two would hit on her. The thought almost made her cry. By rights she should have been five hours married and getting ready to slip away from the reception so she and Rob could consummate their marriage. Just the thought of what she had done to Rob made her feel rotten. He deserved better than that. God, she had so looked forward to being his wife. She doubted that she would ever find another man as perfect for her as he was. 

She wondered how long he had stood there waiting for her to walk down the aisle toward him. Steady girl, she told herself, just remember that you did what you did for him. You loved him enough to spare him the anguish he would have gone through when he found out that you had not come to him a virgin. 

The bartender came back with her pizza and she ate them and ordered another beer. When she got to her destination she would write him a letter of explanation of why she ran and hope that someday he might be able to forgive her. She was taking a sip of her second beer when a soft voice from behind her said: 

"Excuse me miss," and she turned to see a man about her own age standing there. 

"Yes?" 

"I hope you won't think me to forward, but it certainly would be a crime to let you sit there and let all that good music go to waste. Would you dance with me?" 

She smiled as she thought that if she weren't in Benny's she would certainly be dancing at her reception. Why not? She needed to do something to cheer herself up. 

"I'd love to" she said as she got off her barstool and then followed him out onto the dance floor. The dance turned into three and when he invited her to join him and his friends at their table she agreed. There were three guys and two girls at the table when she and Jim went to sit down. Charlie was the odd man out and he and Jim kept her on the dance floor most of the night. 

Six or eight beers later she had decided that since this was the night she was supposed to go to her marriage bed and that she had gone six months without sex (and was as horny as a billy goat) that either Charlie or Jim was going to get lucky that night. It was going to be hard to choose. They were both good looking and they were both trying hard to score. By midnight both of them knew she was going to pick one of them and both were pressing hard to be the chosen one. 

By mid-night fifteen everyone else who had been at the table had gone and just three of them were sitting there. Mindy was ready. Her pussy was dripping from the anticipation and she needed to make a choice and get on with it. Her indecision must have shown on her face because Charlie jokingly said: 

"You could flip a coin." 

She knew he meant it as a joke, but the idea suddenly appealed to her. "That's a great idea," she said as she dug in her purse for a coin. She came up with a quarter and said, "Okay, who gets to call it?" The two guys looked at each other but before either one of them could say anything she said: 

"I'll do it. Jim, you get to be heads and that makes Charlie tails. I'll flip it up in the air and let it hit the floor. When it comes to rest we will look at it and see who won." 

She flipped the coin up into the air and the three of them watched as it turned over and over and over as it rose and then fell. It hit the floor on edge and rolled away. The three of them looked all over, but couldn't find the coin and Jim jokingly said: 

"You know what that means, right?" 

"No," Mindy said, "I don't know what that means." 

"It means you get both of us." 

Charlie laughed and said, "Now that is one hell of a good idea" and both men were caught flat-footed when Mindy, who was no stranger to threesomes, smiled and said: 

"You're right. That is a hell of a good idea, let's go. I'm in the motel at the edge of town." 

"Our place is closer and more comfy. Plus we have a kick ass stereo system if we want to dance and a refrigerator full of beer." 

"Okay, your place it is, but the only dancing I intend to do is horizontal 

+++++ 

The gas gauge showed less than a quarter of a tank and Rob decided that it was time for a pit stop anyway so he took the next exit that had a sign indicating that services were available. The sign at the end of the exit ramp had an arrow showing that he should turn right for gas stations. As he cruised through the small town he saw a neon sign that said, "Burgers and Beer" and he decided to stop in there after he gassed up. 

As the numbers rolled on the pump display he wondered again, for the eleventh or twenty-fifth time, if he had done the right thing in leaving the church. For all he knew Mindy could have been an absolute tiger in bed. Yeah, but she also could have been like his cousin's wife Amy. It was too big a risk for him to take. As much as he loved and craved sex there wasn't anyway he could stay in a sexless marriage. He needed someone with the same hungers he had and if Mindy would have had them they would have shown, wouldn't they? Wouldn't there have been some indication, even a small one? 

He loved her, God knew he loved her, but love alone couldn't hold a marriage together. He knew that. He had seen that happen to family and friends. You needed love AND a good sex life. Everyone he knew who had a failed marriage had said that sex was the reason for the failure. Anywhere from not getting enough to getting it someplace else. No, he was convinced he made the right choice, both for him and for Mindy. If she were anything like George's wife or Tom's wife he would be making her life miserable with the frequency with which he would be trying to have sex. He would constantly be pushing for oral and anal sex as well as regular conventional sex. Looking back he realized he should have been more aggressive in trying to score, especially after she had said yes to his proposal. He should have explained his feelings and fears. She might have said she was looking forward to learning about and enjoying sex in all of its many forms. She might have even made love to him to put his fears to rest, but he never gave her the chance. 

He wondered how long she had waited in the room before they told her he was gone. He would write her and explain when he got to where he was going, not that it would matter to her. She would probably fly into a rage whenever his name was mentioned. He couldn't even crawl back to her and beg forgiveness. How could anyone forgive what he had done? He finished filling his tank, paid and then headed for the place where he'd seen the "Burgers and Beer" sign. A couple of burgers and a beer to wash them down and he'd get on the road again. 

The place was bigger than it looked from the outside. A small dance floor in the center of the room, a bar along one wall, booths along the wall opposite and tables between them. There was a pool table in the back and a jukebox against the back wall. He took a seat at the bar and looked at the menu hanging on the wall behind it. Only hot dogs and hamburgers and a note across the bottom that said, "We don't do fries!!" The special was a half-pound ground round with a slice of Bermuda onion and he ordered one - well done - and asked the bartender what was on draft. He settled for a Bud Light and as he sipped it he looked around and saw that the place was fairly full. 

There were several couples on the dance floor dancing to the tunes from the jukebox and he thought of how that was what he was supposed to be doing right then. He was supposed to be dancing at his wedding reception. He remembered the way Mindy had felt when she was in his arms and it was all he could do to keep from crying. God damn it! How could he have been so stupid! Why hadn't he used his head? Why hadn't he just gone ahead and married the woman he loved and given them a chance. He would have known before the night was over what he had to look forward to in the way of sex and if it looked like it would turn out the way it had for George and Tom he could have kissed Mindy goodbye and gone for an annulment. 

His burger came and he ate it as he sipped his beer. When the burger was gone he noticed that the pool table was empty so he picked up his beer and headed back to it. He put the money in, racked the balls, broke the rack and started shooting. He had half the balls off the table when a soft voice from behind him asked: 

"Like some competition?" 

He turned and saw a very nice looking redhead standing there. 

"I wouldn't be any competition I'm afraid, I'm lousy at pool. I'm just killing some time." 

"Then we are evenly matched since I can't shoot for beans either." 

"Okay then, I guess we can mess around for a bit." 

"Ooooh, that sounds good to me?" 

"What?" 

"Messing around sweetie. I'm Brenda" she said and stuck out her hand. "Rob" he said as he took the offered hand and shook it. 

He put more money in the table and when the balls dropped he racked them. "Eight ball?" he asked. 

"Sounds good" she said and he handed her a cue stick and said, "Ladies first" as he pointed to the rack. She gave a throaty laugh and said, "I'm no lady sweetie, not even close." 

She broke and nothing fell on the break and he missed on his first shot. She screwed up her next shot and he thought that she was indeed as bad as he was, either that or she was trying not to hurt his ego. 

"I haven't seen you in here before" she said. 

"First time." 

"What brings you to this bustling metropolis?" 

"Just passing through. Stopped for gas and a quick bite to eat before getting back on the road." 

"Where you headed?" 

"Don't know. Have a couple of weeks off, pointed the car north and started driving." 

"So you aren't in any real hurry to get anywhere?" 

"No, not really." 

"Well, how nice for me." 

"Pardon?" 

"You are here, not in any hurry to get anywhere and I need someone to shoot pool with and dance with. You aren't going to refuse me, are you?" 

"Why me? The place has a dozen guys who appear to be here alone." 

"I've lived here all my life sweetie and I know most of them and they are for the most part losers and I don't want anything to do with them. You on the other hand are new and therefore interesting." 

"I'm interesting? I've never had a sexy looking redhead tell me that I was interesting before. Maybe I shouldn't get back on the road." 

"Good sweetie, how about we forget about pool, I want to dance." 

Brenda felt good in his arms and he was reminded of the fact that he hadn't had any sex since he started dating Mindy. That thought triggered the thought that he was supposed to have made love to Mindy that night. He wasn't sure if it was the thought of Mindy or the way Brenda felt in his arms that brought on the erection, but whatever caused it Brenda felt it and she didn't pull away from it. In fact, she moved in closer and whispered in his ear: 

"I did mention that I found you interesting, didn't I?" 

Half a dozen dances and a couple of beers later Brenda said, "We need to get out of here sweetie." 

"I don't have a place to go to." 

"Sure you do sweetie, my place. Come on, let's go." 

+++++ 

Mindy looked around and said, "I didn't expect a house. I thought that a couple of single guys who were roommates would be sharing an apartment." 

"The house is cheaper than an apartment. It has three bedrooms so three people splitting the cost makes it less expensive than an apartment.  

===

"You have another roommate?" 

"Yeah, but don't worry, we aren't going to share you with anyone else. Are you ready to see the bedroom?" 

"God yes! More than ready." 

She undressed and sat down on the edge of the bed and watched as Jim and Charlie stripped down. She had never expected to do a threesome ever again. Threesomes were to have been a thing of the past when Rob slipped the ring on her finger and she said, "I do." But now here she was with two very nice hard cocks standing right in front of her. She reached out and took a cock in each hand and then leaned forward and took Jim's in her mouth. She licked and sucked on him for a bit and then she moved her mouth to Charlie's. For the next five minutes she alternated between the two men, licking, sucking and caressing their balls. 

Charlie told her to lie down, that he wanted a taste of her pussy, but Mindy said no. 

"Maybe later, but right now I need a cock in me." 

She stood up, pushed Jim down on the bed and then she spread her legs and lowered her head. Just before she swallowed Jim's cock she looked over her shoulder at Charlie and said: 

"Well, what are you waiting for?" 

Charlie needed no further invitation and he moved up behind her, took her hips in his hands and probed for her opening. Mindy felt the cock head pushing and she pushed back and felt him split her. Oh God, it felt so good to have a cock in her again. It had been so long and she had been so ready to have sex that night. She almost cried since it wasn't Rob, but still, it felt so damned good. 

She moaned as Charlie pushed deeper into her. Her feet were planted on the floor and she supported herself with hands on either side of Jim's legs. Her mouth was locked firmly around Jim's pole and her head was bobbing up and down as she shoved her ass back at Charlie to meet his thrusts. Charlie pounded her steady for several minutes and then he panted: 

"I'm ready, are you protected?" 

Not wanting to get pregnant too soon into her marriage Mindy had gone on the pill two months ago and she took her mouth off of Jim long enough to moan: 

"In me, I want you in me. Fill me lover, fill me." 

Charlie gave several more hard pushes and then she felt the liquid heat fill her and that trigger the first of the many orgasms she was to have that night. Charlie pulled out of her and then Jim pulled her down on the bed and rolled her onto her back and she spread her legs wide so he could mount her and then she clamped her legs around his waist and cried for him to fuck her and fuck her hard. Jim rammed his cock into her as she screamed and had another orgasm. 

Charlie stood watching for a minute or so and wondered if it might be possible to keep this one. Then he went over to the bed, knelt by her head and she turned her head to the side and opened her mouth so he could slide his cock into it. Jim came and then Charlie took his place as Jim replaced Charlie in her mouth and then they both came and switched again. Mindy had screaming orgasm after screaming orgasm as the two men took turns on her. 

Finally they took a break and were sitting on the side of the bed sipping beer. Jim asked how she felt about anal sex and Mindy just smiled and asked, "Do you have any Astroglide or KY?" 

"I'm pretty sure we do." 

"You will need to work on it to loosen me up since no one has been there in a while." 

Jim got up and left the room and minutes later he was back with a tube of KY Jelly in his hands. Mindy pushed Charlie down on his back, got on her knees and started sucking his cock. Her ass was up where Jim could get at it and she felt the coolness of the jelly as he began working on her butt hole. She moaned as the first finger slid into her. Jim worked on her asshole for a good five minutes and when he had three fingers in her he figured she was loose enough. Charlie saw Jim lubing up his cock and he reached down and got Mindy under her arms and pulled her up on him. At first she was confused and then she felt Charlie's cock sliding along her crease and suddenly she knew what was happening. 

"Oh you nasty boy" she moaned as his cock slid into her pussy and he pulled her down so she was lying on his chest. She felt Jim's cock push at her asshole and she took a deep breath and waited for the pain that would turn into pleasure. Jim pushed past her sphincter and she moaned as he moved steadily deeper and deeper into her bowels. As soon as he had as much of himself into her as he could get he stopped pushing and held himself still to let her get used to him. When she started pushing her ass back at him he knew she was ready and he began to fuck her. Charlie let Jim set the pace and then he worked to establish a rhythm and then the two men took their pleasure from their new fuck toy as she screamed and screamed: 

"Fuck me, fuck me hard, make me cum, oh sweet Jesus fuck me, fuck me, fuck me." 

+++++ 

As they entered the living room they heard the loud, "Oh God yes, fuck me, fuck me hard" and Brenda giggled and said, "It sounds like my roommate scored. Think you can make me scream louder?" 

"I can damned sure try." 

As Rob pushed Brenda's legs apart and lowered his face to her bald, shaved pussy he thought again to how much he had looked forward to eating Mindy's pussy. He slid his tongue along the crease and Brenda moaned. He licked her slowly for a minute or so and then he slowly started working it into her pussy. She moaned again and hunched her hips up at him. He used his fingers to spread her open and saw the hard little nubbin of her "Man in the boat" and he latched onto it with his mouth and Brenda wailed, "Oh fuck yes." He smiled to himself as he thought she hadn't screamed as loud as her roommate, but he was just getting started. 

He worked on Brenda with his tongue and fingers until she had cried her way through an orgasm and then he moved up on her. 

"It's been a while for me honey so I might be a little quick on the first one." 

"As long as there is a second and a third time," she said as she pulled her knees back and opened herself for him. He slid into her hot box and her legs came up and clamped him and she moaned: 

"Oh yes lover, push it deep and fuck me, fuck me hard." 

He lasted a lot longer than he thought he would, but still not as long as he would have liked. Brenda didn't seem all that disappointed. As soon as he had cum she had squirmed out from under him. 

"My turn" she said as she lowered her head and swallowed the head of his cock. He looked down at her head bobbing up and down on his joint and the thought that it was supposed to be Mindy doing that to him on that night almost caused him to pull away from Brenda and leave, but only almost because it was a truism that a stiff dick had no allegiance and it wasn't going to leave that hot mouth. 

When Brenda had him as hard as he was going to get she swung over him and used her right hand to guide his cock into her as she lowered herself down. He gripped her and rolled her over onto her back. 

"If I'm going to make you scream louder than what's coming from the next room I need to be on top so I can pound hard and deep." 

"Pound away lover, pound away and make me scream." 

And he did. 

+++++ 

Mindy was lost in a fog of lust as she sat on Jim's cock while Charlie pumped deeper and deeper into her ass. She was moaning and whimpering as the two men used her and made her orgasm. She'd had so many that she didn't think she would be able to get up and walk when they finished with her. The loud, "OH shit! Oh yes!" cut through the fog and she said: 

"What was that?" 

"It sounds like our roomie found a playmate for the night." 

"Oh fuck yes! Again, again, harder damn it harder" came through the walls and she remembered all the screaming she had done as Charlie and Jim did their level best to fuck her eyes out. She realized that if she could hear them they could hear her and somehow that excited her and she slammed her ass back at Charlie and screamed out: 

"Yes lover, yes. Fuck my ass, fuck my ass, fuck my ass." 

Brenda giggled, "Sounds like my roommate is having a good time. Would you like to try my ass and see if you can make me scream like that?" 

"Got any KY?" 

"I'll find something lover, even if it is only a stick of butter." 

She was back moments later with a can of Crisco. "We had a tube of KY in the medicine cabinet, but it isn't there so I guess from what we are hearing through the wall that we know where it is. This should work though" and she handed him the can of Crisco and then got on her knees and put her head down on a pillow. 

It worked very well and while Brenda's screams might not have been loud enough to drown out the screams from the next room he knew that whoever was in there heard them. 

+++++ 

Mindy was exhausted. She hadn't been fucked so hard or so often since a week before she started dating Rob. Oh God, why couldn't it have been his cock in her that night. She fell asleep thinking of Rob and what could have been. 

Brenda washed off his cock with a warm, soapy rag, dried it with a towel and said: 

"If I can get it up again can I have it one more time?" 

"I'd be a fool to say no to that." 

"Yes you would, wouldn't you." 

But try as she might she just could not get him to rise to the occasion again. He fell to the bed totally wiped out and he fell asleep dreaming about Mindy and what should have been. 

+++++ 

The screams woke him up. "Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh fuck yes!" came through the wall and he opened his eyes to see Brenda leaning on an elbow and looking down at him. 

"How in God's name do you get any sleep around here with all that racket going on?" 

"I've never heard it before. There must be something very special going on over there. In the three years we have lived together I've never heard a peep out of that room and my roomie has somebody in there on the average of twice a week. I wonder if they heard us last night. You did do a pretty good job of making me scream. I think we owe it to them to try and drown them out, don't you?" she said as she reached for his cock. 

+++++ 

"Are you sure you won't stay for a couple of days?" Charlie asked as he dropped her off at the motel. 

"I had a grand time last night Charlie. You and Jim were just what I needed last night, but I really do have to go." 

She leaned over and kissed him and then got out of her car and went into her room. She closed the door and then leaned back against it and then the tears started to flow. She threw herself down on the bed and sobbed into the pillow. "I'm sorry Rob, I'm so sorry." 

+++++ 

She let his limp cock fall from her mouth after cleaning off the residue from their last coupling. "I'll put on the coffee," she said as she put on a robe and then left the room." He dressed and followed her into the kitchen. There was a man sitting at the table leafing through the morning paper and he looked up as Rob came in and said: 

"Good morning. Brenda's bell ringer I presume?" 

"Rob, this is Jim, one of my roommates." 

Rob raised an eyebrow and said, "Oh? I thought your roommate was the woman I heard." He shook Jim's hand and said, "It sounded like you rang a few bells of your own last night." 

"She was loud, wasn't she. I had help. Charlie and I could barely keep up with her. Charlie and I tried to talk her into sticking around for a few days or forever, but she wanted to hit the road." 

"Charlie?" 

"My other roommate" Brenda said. "We all got lucky and then struck out it seems." 

"Struck out?" Jim asked. 

"Yeah. I tried to talk Rob into staying, but he says he has to hit the road too." 

Rob had one cup of coffee, kissed Brenda goodbye and headed for the entrance ramp to the Interstate. Just before he pulled on to the ramp he saw a red Miata parked in front of the motel just up the road. It was just like the one Mindy owned and his eyes teared up and he cried, "Oh God Mindy, I'm so sorry" and then he was on the Interstate and heading north. 

+++++ 

Christina's ending. 

Mindy was sitting at the kitchen table watching Charlie put the coffee on when she heard, "OH FUCK!" and she turned and saw Rob standing in the doorway. 

"What are you doing here?" they both said in unison, and then Mindy said, "How did you find me" just as Brenda walked into the room. 

"You two know each other?" she asked. 

Neither Rob nor Mindy answered the question; they just stared at each other. Brenda looked from one to the other and then said to Mindy, "You must be the screamer who spent the night in Charlie's bedroom." 

"She is indeed and I'm trying hard to talk her into staying." 

Just then Jim came into the room and said, "I second that emotion. I'm in love and I'm going to ask her to marry me." 

"Oh no you don't," said Charlie, "I asked her first." 

"That was you in the next room last night? You and two guys?" Rob asked and he got his answer in the way that Mindy looked away from him. "That sure did not sound like any virgin that I ever heard before." 

Mindy looked at Rob and said, "I wasn't a virgin Rob, that's why I ran." 

"You ran? Oh sweet Jesus" and he started to laugh and then said, "I spent all day yesterday and most of last night hating myself for leaving you at the altar and you weren't even there." 

"Would one of you tell me what is going on here?" Brenda asked. 

"Yeah" chimed in Charlie, "I think we would all like to know." 

Mindy took a deep breath and told what she had done and why and when she finished Rob laughed and said, "Ain't that a kick in the ass. You ran because you weren't a virgin and I ran because I thought you were" and then he told his side of the story. 

Brenda looked from one to the other and shook her head. And you both ended up here, not only in this town, but also in this house? Amazing, just fucking amazing. It is a sign if you ask me." 

"A sign? What kind of a sign?" asked Jim. 

"Obviously these two were meant to be together and somebody or something worked damned hard to get them here at the same time. Not only that, but in such a way that she didn't have to face him and confess she wasn't a virgin and in a way that showed him that his fears that she might not like sex were groundless." 

"Yeah, maybe," said Jim, "But how do they get past last night?" 

"Well, I guess last night never happened." 

"What?" said Charlie. 

"Last night didn't happen. What he did cancelled out what she did and what she did cancelled out what he did. Neither one has anything that they can hold over the other so basically it was a non-event." 

Mindy looked at Rob, "Is that true Rob? Was last night a non-event?" 

"No baby, it was definitely not a non-event. What it was was a wake up call. If you can forgive me for being stupid I can most certainly forgive you for being scared." 

"What do we do now?" asked Mindy. 

"Road trip!" Brenda said. 

"What?" Charlie and Jim said almost in unison. 

"Road trip! We load these two love birds in the car and we go for a ride." 

"Go for a ride? Where?" asked Rob. 

"Las Vegas is only four hours away," Brenda said, "We can have the two of you there, married and in bed by six tonight." 

She looked from Rob to Mindy and then back at Rob as she said, "Unless Mindy would rather stay in Charley's room and play with him and Jim while I keep Rob busy in mine." 

"Oh yeah. I like that idea" Jim said. 

"Sorry guys, you were great" Mindy said, "But I almost lost Rob once in the last twenty-four hours and I don't want to go through that again." 

"I'll second that" Rob said.

The Hawaiian Wedding Song played over the sound system as Mindy came toward him where he stood with a minister who was also an Elvis impersonator. Brenda was the Maid of Honor, Jim was acting as Best Man and Charlie was going to give the bride away. A far cry from the way it was supposed to have happened the day before, but it felt right - it just felt right. Report_Story
