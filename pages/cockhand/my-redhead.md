Maureen and I had hit that point in our fifteen-year marriage where everything was run of the mill and taken for granted. The excitement had gone out of our sex life and we were more or less going through the motions as a duty to each other more than anything else. I knew it, but I wasn't aware that Maureen knew it until the night she looked at me across the dinner table and asked me a question. 

"Have you ever thought of cheating on me?" 

The question was totally off the wall, but even so I didn't have to think hard to come up with the answer, "Sure I have." 

"Have you?" 

"No, of course not." 

"Why haven't you?" 

"Fear mostly." 

"Fear of what?" 

"Getting caught. Getting caught and having a good idea that getting caught would be the end of our marriage and I don't want to lose you." 

"What if you knew that it wouldn't come between us, would you then?" 

"What's this all about Maureen?" 

"It's about holding on to our marriage. I've been watching you for a year now. You are restless and feeling tied down and you don't seem to be satisfied with me or what we have. So I've decided to let you go out and find out if the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. So go ahead, go out and sow some wild oats." 

"You can't be serious." 

"Oh but I am. I know that I'm the best thing that ever happened to you and at one time you knew it too. You've apparently forgotten and the best way to remind you is to let you go out and play. The only stipulation is that you have to tell me everything. No secrets - you have to tell me everything you do and who you do it with." 

"Why?" 

"Who knows. Maybe you will learn something and bring it home and it will spice up our sex life." 

I didn't quite know how to take that. I had never been told that it would be all right to be unfaithful before and to be honest I wasn't all that sure that I wanted to be. Also in the back of my mind a little voice was asking why she was doing it. I mean, I can count on the thumbs of one foot the number of married guys I know whose wives have told them to go out and get some strange and then come home and tell them about it. The more I thought about the more I began to think I was being set up. She wanted me to do it so she could. I could picture it in my mind, "Well, you did it so it should be all right for me to do it." Also, regardless of my answer to her question in the affirmative I really had no interest in other women and I damn sure didn't want Maureen fucking another guy, so what to do? 

The obvious thing was to do nothing and that is just what I did. A week went by and then Maureen asked me if I had found any one to play with yet and I told her no. 

"Why not. There are plenty out there. You ought to be able to find one at that bar where you stop off after work for a beer with your buddies." 

"I don't know Maureen. I haven't gone after anyone since going after you. I wouldn't even know what to do any more." 

"Bullshit honey. All you have to do is pick one you like, buy her a drink and hit on her." 

I told her that I would try it, but I didn't. Once or twice a week for the next three weeks Maureen would ask me how I was doing and then one night just to shut her up I called her from the bar and told her I would be home late. 

"I got a hot date, if you know what I mean." 

"What does she look like?" 

"Later honey. I have to go now before some other guy moves in on her." 

I hung up the phone and went back to shooting pool with my buddies. 

I expected Maureen to be in bed asleep when I got home, but no such luck. She was waiting for me and wanted to know all the details so I had to make up a story as I went along. I told Maureen that a hot looking redhead and I had made eye contact and the redhead looked interested so I bought her a drink. One thing had led to another and we had gone to a motel and made love several times. I told Maureen that the redhead had sucked my cock and then we had sixty-nined and then we had made love - three times. Maureen grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the bedroom, "Hurry baby, I want you to do everything with me that you did with her." When I fell asleep I was exhausted. 

Maureen woke me up with a blow job the next morning and then she asked me when I was going to see the redhead again. Well, the previous nights sex had been the best in a long time and I was interested in getting more and so I said, "She asked me if she could see me tomorrow, but I wasn't really sure how you were going to take it so I didn't commit." 

"Well you call her today and commit because last nights sex was fantastic and I want to do it again." 

For the next three weeks I had fictitious dates with my imaginary redhead on the average of three times a week and every time I would go home to find Maureen waiting up for me. She would drag me into the bedroom, ask me what I had done with the redhead and then she would want to duplicate it. Finally I decided to play it to my advantage. The one thing that Maureen had never let me do was have anal sex with her. One night when I got home Maureen asked me what Jessica (the name I had given the redhead) and I had done. I shrugged and went into the bathroom. When I came out Maureen asked, "What's wrong baby. Didn't tonight go well?" 

"I don't want to talk about it sweetie." 

"Come on baby, you know the deal - no secrets!" 

I hesitated and Maureen said, "Come on baby, give." 

"She asked me to fuck her in her butt." 

"She actually let you fuck her in her ass?" 

"Yes." 

"She liked it?" 

"Must have. She was begging me the entire time to do her harder and faster and just before I left we did it for a second time." 

Maureen looked at me for several seconds and then said, "I guess we can try it once." 

I spent ten minutes working on Maureen's ass with my thumb and fingers and a liberal amount of KY Jelly and when I finally pushed my cock in her she went nuts. I did her ass twice before we fell asleep and in the morning she wanted to do it again. I was beginning to love my redhead - she was making my life so very interesting. 

It was just a little over a month since my affair with the redhead started and I was sitting at the dinner table with Maureen when she said, "How are you getting along with Jessica? Still have a hot affair going?" 

I told her that things seemed to be going well. 

"Good. I'm glad that you are having a good time. I've felt so guilty these last two years. I feel a lot better now that you are seeing Jessica." 

"Why have you been feeling guilty?" 

Maureen looked away from me and was silent for several moments and then she said, "I've been having an affair." 

"For two years?" 

She still wouldn't look at me, but she shook her head yes. Then she looked up at me and said, "But I don't love him, not the way I love you. I like him and he's exciting to be with, but I would never leave you for him. I would never leave you for anyone baby. He came along at a time when I was feeling down and unwanted and we clicked and things just seemed to happen. And it didn't seem to be hurting our marriage any so I just kept seeing him. But I was feeling guilty all the time and it was showing up in our sex life. I couldn't bring myself to make love with you after I had been with him. It's weird that I want you so much after you have been with Jessica, but couldn't face you when I had been with Mark. But now you have Jessica and you and I are getting along better than ever so I think things are working out just great." 

She grinned at me, "Maybe you and Jessica can double date one night with me and Mark, wouldn't that be a kick?" 

She stood up from the table and said, "Come on baby, take your hot and horny wife to bed." 

She headed toward the bedroom and then turned back toward me and gave me a big smile, "By the way, Mark says thanks for turning me on to anal sex. He just loves my ass." Then she turned and headed for the bedroom leaving me staring at her back. Report_Story
