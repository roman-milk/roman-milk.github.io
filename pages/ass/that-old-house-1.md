================ 

He got more than a house - for better or worse 

This is my first foray into Erotic Horror. Although there are horror/evil elements, in the end it's a romance, with a heavy paranormal theme. I wasn't sure if this went in Erotic Horror, Non-human, or Romance. Let me know if I got it wrong. 

This is a long, slow-developing, complex story. Very long, approaching novel length at 56,000 words. You might want to check out the number of pages before starting. It's more than a couple of hours read. Thank you in advance for your patience. 

Thanks to PatientLee, Dakota_Lynn, and my Writing Group for their valuable input, perhaps making a confusing read almost readable. They're also responsible for eliminating almost a quarter of the length. 

This is an entry in the 2013 Halloween Contest. 

================ 

For four years I'd driven by that old house. It was high on a hill, hidden by the ancient trees around it. You could occasionally glimpse one of the four towering chimneys through a break in the foliage, but even in winter I could barely make out the silhouette of the building. 

It was only a few hundred yards off the interstate. Twice, my curiosity had gotten the better of me, and I'd tried to get closer to it. The sheer cliff where they'd cut through for the highway, made any approach from the west impossible, so I searched for adjacent roads. After a few hours of wasted effort, it was clear there was no avenue up to the house proper. Studying the latest street maps, I could find nothing that got me anywhere near the hilltop. 

I didn't know why I was so drawn to the place, but it was always on my mind, a compulsion. I studied surveying maps and asked around the nearest town, several miles away, but couldn't find out any more about it. I researched properties for sale and old tax records, all to no avail. 

There was a history to the house, and old records, but everything seemed to end around the 1930's. I ran into a blank at every turn. The more of a challenge it proved, the more stubborn I became. My obstinance was both a blessing and a curse. 

The place was well off the beaten path, in backwoods Virginia, and I was only out in the area every couple of months or so, when working with a rural customer. More often than not I just drove past, staring up at the mystery. Straining to see just a little more, something to assuage my curiosity. 

Finally my patience surrendered to my obsession. I planned a day excursion, and one fine morning I parked my car at what I thought was the nearest and most likely access point, sprayed on an extra helping of Deep Woods Off, and started hiking in. It was hard going, no trail to speak of, which surprised me. Places like this were always targets for neighborhood kids to hang out and get in trouble. Perhaps the scarcity of local population, combined with the difficulty of access discouraged it. 

The route couldn't have been much more than half a mile at best, and yet the thick undergrowth and vicious thorns kept me at bay for nearly 2 hours. I fought through, determined, clingy vines grasping at my legs, immense deadfalls abruptly blocking my route, hidden thorny branches shredding my skin, unsurpassable thickets forcing me deeper into the woods. After a few hundred yards I was exhausted, silently cursing the dark foreboding woods that sought to deny me my goal. The woods opened up to larger, more sedate forest giants that silently observed my implacable progress, before closing in again as I reached the top of the hill. When I finally broke free into the open, the manse stood before me, magnificent and sad at the same time. 

It was huge, beyond my expectations. Three full stories, with 2 large chimneys on each end of the house, maybe 15 feet apart. The building was stone, five window openings on the end facing me, stacked 2-2-1, now just gaping holes in the side of the building. 

The front was impressive, with a wide double doorway in the center, bracketed by two window openings on each side. On the second and third floors there had been five windows each. Now just dark smudges on the ancient fa√ßade. 

The original porch was long gone, but with some effort I climbed up the front into the entrance. I was holding my breath, eager to view the interior for the first time, my mind adrift in the contemplation of the wonders ahead of me. The first sight was a punch in the gut. 

Decrepit ruin and rot, devastating in its completeness, that was my reward. It was well lit, the light from the window openings flooding it, and daylight streaming down from above. Looking up, I could see the sky through the three intervening ceilings and the roof. Portions of the floors were still intact, as were many of the joists, pillars and beams. I carefully maneuvered my way along the walls, to see some of what lay hidden from view. Each step was an adventure, the soft rotted wood eager to pitch me into the darkness below, if I strayed from the safety of the joists. 

Soot blackened walls, and charred beams told me a fire must have destroyed the place. From the look of things it was the worst on the third floor and attic, with the ground floor somehow surviving with the least ruin. Significant damage, but not the hollowed out shell the top floors had become. 

I made it most of the way up the stairs to the second floor before the creaking of the rotted wood underfoot had my heart racing too fast to continue. When a board disintegrated underfoot, compulsion yielded to common sense, and I gave it up as too dangerous. I had peeked over the top into the floor space above, but it was difficult to tell where rooms had been. In a few places, hints remained of what might have been walls, but fallen detritus from the floor above made even that a guess at best. The devastation was near complete. Carefully working my way back down, legs trembling, I retreated from the house, my curiosity only further inflamed. 

From the outside the place was majestic. The stone looked perfect, the proportions ideal. The outline of the steeply pitched roof and those 4 fantastic chimneys against the sky were breathtaking. I walked around the building, still at a loss for how the exterior walls could look so solid, with so little inside to hold them up. 

There was a 30 yard area surrounding the house, where the trees had not yet dared to trespass. The grass and clover intermixed, on the peak of the hill, where the decrepit mansion now stood. I could only imagine what it must have looked like in its glory. 

I wondered if it was possible to restore it to that glory. 

I knew I wanted to try. 

* * * 

It took me six months of effort to track down the ownership of the property. It was considered unimproved, the House not even showing up on paperwork. Fifty year old businesses exchanged land ownership, their actions hidden behind the corporate veil. 

Actually contacting the owner proved almost as difficult. The House had become my hobby, taking over much of my free time, occupying my thoughts. I made countless phone calls, mailing in public information requests, spending hours and hours at the local courthouse and records room. 

Eventually my stubbornness won out. I found myself in a senior home halfway across the country, nervous to finally meet the person who I believed was the actual owner. I glanced around the room, dizzied by the combination of opulence and decay. The furniture, wallpaper, artwork, were so different from the nursing homes I was familiar with. Nothing modular or modern, it spoke of a different age, and a different class of clientele. At the same time my senses were assaulted with a variety of smells conflicting with each other. Bleach, mildew, urine, dust, and an overall mustiness that was depressing. The curtains were inexplicably closed blocking out the sunlight, leaving vague shadows in its place. 

One of the assistants wheeled out an elderly woman in a wheelchair. She looked like she might have been around at the turn of the previous century. Her gray hair, or what was left of it, was carefully combed back. She had makeup on, an elegant dress, and jewelry. She had clearly made herself up for my visit. 

"Mrs. Madison? I'm Jack Thompson. I hope you don't mind my coming to speak to you." 

She giggled. The sound seemed out-of-place, coming from her. "Mind? Of course not. It's not every day that a lady has such a handsome young man come to call. Would you like some tea? Ralph would be happy to get us some." 

"That would be very nice. Please." 

"I'm so glad you've come by. I don't get many visitors these days." 

"I'm very happy to be here. You're not an easy woman to find, Mrs. Madison." 

"Beverly, please. Mrs. Madison sounds like my mother-in-law. I shouldn't be that hard to find. I'm afraid I've been cooped up in here for nearly 20 years now." 

Cooped up? I could understand that feeling. I would want out of that environment, given any chance. "Would you like to go outside? It's a beautiful day out." 

"Do you think we could?" 

"I don't see why not, Beverly. Why don't we have our tea out on the lawn?" I'd seen several tables outside, and thought it would be pleasant to be outdoors. Far more pleasant than where I stood. 

"That would be divine." 

I guided her wheelchair out the door, taking the ramp out to the spacious front lawn, and steered her to an open table with some shade. I parked her there, briefly wondering why more people weren't outside on such a gorgeous day. 

"I'll be right back with our tea," I told her. 

"Thank you, Jack." 

Ralph was looking around for us, with a serving tray in his hands. 

"Sorry, Ralph. Mrs. Madison and I will be having our tea outside at one of the tables. I hope that's not a problem." 

He didn't seem concerned, and passed me the tray. I returned to Beverly, and set one of the cups before her. She lifted the lid off a matching small bowl, and using silver tongs, she added two sugar cubes to her cup. I'd never seen a sugar cube before. I was fascinated with her slow precise movements. Everything about her whispered grace and elegance. 

"I love the spring, don't you?" she asked, sipping daintily from her old- fashioned china tea cup. 

"Absolutely. Spring and fall are my favorite seasons by far." 

"I'm afraid my spring and fall have passed me by. I'm well into winter by now." 

"A very lovely winter it is," I told her, smiling. I was surprised at my own mild flirting. Something about her set me at ease. 

"You're sweet to say so. It is lonely." 

"I'm surprised. I'd expect half the men in the house to be courting you." 

"Oh, there still are a few, but mostly silly old fools." 

"I'd say the ones who aren't are the fools." 

She smiled. "I'd agree with you, but that would be awfully brazen of me, wouldn't it?" 

Beverly seemed to have her wits about her, and was quite easy to talk to. We chatted about the weather, and I found out she was a baseball fan, and we argued a little about the American League East. 

She pushed her cup away, and raised her head to the sun, basking in it. "I'm sure you didn't come out here just to flirt with an old woman." 

I blushed. "Beverly, do you own a piece of property in Virginia? A hillside burned out home on a piece of rural land, not too far from the Chesapeake?" 

She thought about it. "I own a few properties. Most of them leased out. In Virginia you say?" 

"Yes. The House looks very old. Not much left on the inside, but the outside is still impressive." 

"I believe that was my Uncle Donald's place. A very sad story. His young wife and infant daughter perished in the fire. He couldn't stand to live there and moved west. He left me the property in his will. That must have been over 40 years ago." 

"I've been fascinated by the old house on the property, and would like to try to restore it. Would you consider selling the place?" 

"You're not from around here? You live out that way?" 

"Yes ma'am." 

"You've come a long distance to discuss this, haven't you?" 

"I've been working for almost a year to find out who owned it, and to try to buy it." I confessed. 

"Why would you want to rebuild it?" 

"Honestly, I don't know. It's been on my mind since I caught my first glimpse of it, nagging me incessantly. When I finally hiked my way in to see it, I couldn't help but imagine what it must have been like in its hay-day, and would love to see it restored to its previous glory. I have an image in my kind of what it should look like, and I'd like to take my time rebuilding it, and live there." 

"Quite a fascination you've developed." 

"Yes it is. It consumes me. I'm not rich, but I think I could give you a fair price for the place." 

She looked at me long and hard. She didn't speak for a couple of minutes. I didn't pressure her to. "Perhaps we could come to an agreement," she said. 

"I hope we can." 

"The truth is, I don't need a lot of money. I'm fairly well off, and as you might imagine, my needs are simple, and I don't have a lot of expenses." 

Before I could answer she continued. 

"I have a confession, Jack. I'm lonely. And I've thoroughly enjoyed the time we've spent together." 

"As have I, Beverly." As have I? 

"Could you do something for me? Keep me involved in your project. Talk to me. Call me regularly. Maybe send me pictures of your progress. I have no family, and the days get longer and longer. I'd love to see what you can do with the old place." 

"If we can come to terms, I'd love to have you involved. I'd be happy to call you as often as you wish, and send you weekly pictures of my progress, if any. Videos of the place. Whatever I could do." 

"When it's done, could you take me out there, to see it? Please?" She reached out with her small, cold hands, and placed them over mine. 

How lonely she must be. "Ma'am, I'll fly you out there whenever you want, at my expense. There's no access currently, but once I've cleared a road to the house, I'd love to have you come out to view it as it is now, and to see what I can make of it." 

Her eyes glistened as she looked off into the distance. "You won't forget me once I've signed it over, will you?" 

"We could guarantee I wouldn't in the contract." 

"I just need your word." 

"Beverly, you have my solemn word. Like you, I have no family. I never knew my parents. I have no wife, no girlfriend, no children. I'm quite alone in this world, and can't think of anybody I'd rather share this adventure with." 

Her eyes welled up, and tears started to slowly trickle down her cheek. "Jack, I'm rather tired. I'd like to go in now." 

"Of course." Disappointed, I rolled her away from the table and wheeled her back into the building. At the threshold she stopped me. 

"Are you returning east immediately?" 

"My schedule's open," I assured her. 

"I'll have my lawyer stop by tomorrow. If you could come by for dinner, perhaps we can conclude our deal." 

"Wild horses couldn't keep me away. Thank you." 

* * * 

Back in my room I was nervous. We hadn't agreed on the price, and once the lawyers got involved who knew what would happen? I was so close. I had a hard time getting to sleep that night. 

In the morning I felt much calmer. I believed Beverly. I was convinced she wanted this as much as I did. I went out and did a little shopping, prepared to show her how serious I was about keeping her involved. 

I stopped by the home at 4:30, not certain what time dinner was. I appeared to have guessed correctly. She and a distinguished older gentleman were seated at a table, waiting for me. 

Beverly beamed. "Jack! I have to tell you, I haven't been this excited in ages. I'd like to introduce you to my friend, Jerome." 

Jerome stood and shook my hand. He had a determined gaze, and a firm handshake. "Convince me I should approve this." 

"Now Jerome..." Beverly chided. 

"No, Beverly, he's right. He has your best interests in mind. Allow me, if I may." 

Once again, I explained in detail, how I'd first seen the place, and come to be enthralled by it. I reviewed my research, my desire, and my place in the world. He was quiet, letting me go on. 

I opened my briefcase, and pulled out the gift. "Beverly, this picture frame can show a variety of photos." I turned it on, and she saw the digital images of the house in its current state. "I can hook this up to the internet, and put it in your room. Then whenever I have new pictures, I can remotely put them on your picture frame for you to see, that same day." 

She seemed excited by the idea. She was watching the picture frame, and I showed her how she could move the pictures back and forth in order, pause at any one, or leave them in slide-show mode. 

I held up my smartphone. "This phone took the photos I just showed you. I'll keep it with me at all times on the property, and I promise I'll take plenty of pictures every step of the way. I'll upload them as soon as I have internet access." 

Finally, I pulled out another cell-phone. "This is for you. I've programmed my number into it. The bill will come directly to me. You can call me anytime, and I will try to call you every day. I don't want to commit to every day, since I'm not sure I can keep that promise. But I will do my best." 

Beverly looked over at her lawyer, with a big smirk on her face. "Jerome?" 

He sighed. "Damn it. Alright, I'm convinced. Sign here." 

He pushed a paper toward me. 

"We haven't agreed on the price yet," I said, hesitating. 

"I'm sure you can afford it." He flipped the contract back to the first page and pointed. The sales price was $1.00. 

I was flabbergasted. "Beverly, that's not fair." 

"Jack, it's just an expense for me. I pay taxes every year on a piece of land I never see and make no money off of. You'll be doing me a favor. Please agree to this." 

I could feel the tears welling in my eyes. My dream was coming true. "I... I don't know what to say." 

"Say yes and sign the paper. Save your money for the repairs. I suspect they will not be cheap." 

I looked over at Jerome, who shrugged. "She wants to do this. Trust me, there's no stopping it now. And financially, it won't hurt her in the least. Sign the contract." 

I signed the paper, and went around the table and asked if it was Ok if I hugged her. She struggled to her feet, leaning heavily on my arm, and let me embrace her. I held her a long time, until I could control my emotions. My shoulder was wet when I finally eased her back into her chair. 

As I took my seat she thanked me. 

"I'm the one who should be thanking you. You've made it possible for my 5 year dream to come true." 

"Jack, this is the happiest and most fun I've had in longer than I care to admit. Follow your dream. Just don't forget me." 

"Never. I swear." 

Jerome interrupted. "That's done. How about we have dinner? It's getting late." 

* * * 

It was a daunting task ahead of me. I tried to make sure that my work didn't suffer, but I spent every weekend working on my project. My holidays and vacation time were spent laboring on the House. Every day I called Beverly, in the morning, reviewing my progress, if any, the day before, and discussing my future plans. Over time our discussions moved away from the House, and encompassed our lives. We talked about my job, my project, and my Spartan life away from the two. 

"Jack, why don't you date?" 

"I don't have the time, right now. I'm rather focused on my work and the House, and it doesn't make me very sociable." 

"BS. You're a handsome young man. You should have a girl." 

"I'd like that very much. And someday I hope I will. But that's in the future." 

"But you dated in the past?" 

"I have. That didn't work out so well. I think I'm too intense for most of the women I meet. The same fixation I have on the House, I tend to have on whatever I'm working on." 

"Go out tonight and relax. Chat up a girl. Buy her a drink." 

I laughed. "Ok, Mom, I'll see if I can't go out for a beer tonight. No promises about the girl."  

===

She was quiet. "Mom. Nobody ever called me that." 

"I'm sorry, I hope I didn't offend you." 

"Offend me? It's the nicest thing you've ever said. I should be so lucky." 

"Beverly, you're the best thing to happen to me in ages. I can't tell you how happy I am to talk to you each day. I don't think I knew how lonely I was before you." 

I heard her sniffle. "Enough already. You'll make an old woman cry. Go to work before you're late." 

"On my way, Mom. Don't nag." 

"What else are Moms for?" 

* * * 

The property was huge, and 90% covered with old-growth trees. The woods seemed ancient, and sometimes a little scary. Mostly oaks and hickory, some walnuts, poplars, and a scattering of other trees broke up the oak-hickory monopoly. Only the perimeter, near the roads and property line, was populated with newer, denser growth, creating a natural barrier to the outside world. 

I found the original entrance to the property, by working my way backwards from The House. The original path I'd taken to the building in my early explorations had the newest trees. Something had cleared out the old-growth there, whether it was a fire, or logging, I don't know. Smaller trees, dense undergrowth, and innumerable thorn thickets made it almost impassable as I'd learned. The original road traveled through older, massive trees, many 50-60 feet or taller, with diameters of 3 to 4 feet common. Only as you approached the main road, did the trees give way to the newer, dense woods I'd encountered my first time out. 

The idea of getting all the permits necessary for building scared the hell out of me. I was immensely relieved when the county inspector came out to visit the property. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy, extremely helpful, and even excited to be involved in the process. It seemed like I got a ton of waivers for restoring a historic property, as long as I didn't do anything to change the exterior. The biggest issue for him was the design of the front porch, the type of windows used, and the look of the roof, as long as I left the stonework intact. He seemed to be on the phone half the time he was with me, calling in questions, and each time arguing for the minimum amount of oversight. I grew to like and respect Andrew, and assured him I'd keep him in the loop. 

After weeks of research, I selected a used portable hydraulic sawmill to purchase, figuring I could use it to cut my own wood, and sell it when I was done. Together with a rented Caterpillar and some diesel generators and worksite lighting, I worked from dawn to nearly midnight. No fear of neighbors complaining, not from over a mile away, with the woods serving as a natural sound barrier. 

I sold my townhouse and moved from downtown to a month-by-month rental at the edge of the suburbs. From there I had a forty minute commute to work, but I was only a little more than an hour from The House. I spent more and more of my time there, building wall supports, replacing the large beams, installing new joists, slowly giving The House a new skeleton. 

I never seemed to have enough time for the house. I moved an inexpensive used trailer onto the property, so I no longer had to leave on the weekends. It gained me a another 6-8 hours of work, and gave me a place to store my tools out of the weather. 

I've always been handy with tools. I can thank my second foster parents for that. Still, it seemed every day I was confronted with some new challenge, which inevitably required research and experimentation. I didn't mind. My obstinance and willingness to make mistakes usually saw me through. Unfortunately, that meant often doing the same job two or three times until I got it right. 

I had some regular laborers I'd hired, along with the occasional specialist. I even found some interested volunteers who were fascinated with the effort. A few experts on old stone houses became my online friends, and were exceedingly generous with their advice and connections. The work was progressing but I was exhausted. 

The wood we cleared from the 600 yard winding entrance road was a good start, and we cleared most of the trees from the top of the hill back another 20 yards or so, more in the back. Unusual or very large trees I left in place; I liked the look and had a hard time cutting down trees that old. Besides, they were hell to work with. The sawmill was getting heavy use, grinding out board after board for the flooring, decking, and some of the walls. I learned a lot in the process, especially about costs. For the wood to be usable indoors, I had to have it kiln dried, which meant having it hauled almost 40 miles and waiting another two weeks or more to get it back. I experimented with air drying some of the wood, which I would use later in the year. A lot of work, and plenty of blisters and splinters later, it looked like I had enough wood left to build another two houses if I so desired. The smaller branches yielded a firewood pile large enough for me to into the business. 

I located some experts to help with cutting the huge beams needed to replace the original ones that hadn't survived. A single huge standing dead white oak provided all I needed. That was a whole new experience, trying to work with beams that were a foot wide and deep, and 30 feet long. The assistance I need for that put a dent in my budget. A big one. 

Everything was expensive, and I had over $80K into the work before I could even see much progress. Electricity and phone service didn't look like they were going to be too difficult, but water was a major issue. One more thing I hadn't counted on. It cost $12,000 to get water into my house. The bills kept adding up, and I realized I didn't have enough money to finish the work. I considered a mortgage on the land, and took out a loan from my 401K. 

I made good money, and saved what I could. I had made a tidy profit off my place in the city, a fixer-upper I'd polished up. I did much of the restoration work myself, and the experience was turning out to be invaluable. Despite doing as much as I could myself, and using available materials, everything was so damn costly. I paid. I didn't have any other choice. 

I still talked with Beverly daily, often twice a day or even more often. I realized that after nearly seven months, I was probably going to have to put much of the work on hold, while I slowly built up some funds. It was fall, and I knew that winter would put a halt to much of my work. I hated the idea of anything slowing me down, but my options were dwindling. 

It had taken me nearly two months just to get the walls supported properly so I could do the necessary interior work. I managed to get the roof completed, and had replaced the huge interior crossbeams the floors rested upon. Working the upper floors, especially the third floor, was an adventure. The damage up there was extensive, and I seemed to have more mishaps 30' feet in the air than I would have cared for. Maybe it was me, nervous about working up so high; twice I came close to falling, boards shifting underneath me, or the weight of a beam unbalancing. I lost two full days when a central joist shifted badly, falling to the floor below, and I followed, fortunate to avoid serious injury. After that, I was more cautious, putting up temporary plywood sheets over the floor holes. It was time consuming, but at least I could work without breaking out in a cold sweat every time I looked down. It was not work for the faint of heart. 

By the end of summer the floor and ceiling joists were nearing completion. I decided to stop the intermediate work, close off the top floors, seal up the windows and do what I could to make the main floor livable. I wanted to get out of my rental place and move into The House. It would make more money available for the work, and in spite of the 3-4 hour round-trip commute, I could work on it every evening, doing some interior finish. 

Some will consider it blasphemous, but I had no interest in restoring the home to its original condition. My research and visiting experts agreed The House was probably late 18th century, with several changes made to it. One cornerstone had 1791 carved in it, but another said 1803. Either way The House was ancient, and probably deserved a lot more attention to historical significance than I was interested in giving it. I loved it for what it was, and wanted to make a place I was happy to live in, in comfort. If that meant not scouring the countryside for period flooring and paneling, that was fine by me. I wasn't rebuilding somebody else's dream house, I was building mine. And I knew exactly what I wanted. 

With the first floor wiring in, some basic plumbing, and a workable kitchen, I was tapped out. More than $180K invested, and from the outside, you could barely tell, except for the new roof and entrance. But the place was livable. Mostly. Andrew, my county inspector had come by, hanging out for a couple of hours, signing off on the first floor wiring and plumbing. He explained that was unusual in itself. 

"But then again," he laughed. "There's nothing 'usual' about any of this project. Takes some big cojones to take on something like this on your own." 

"That or just too ignorant to understand the challenge." 

"You understand," he said, "you can't live in a house that's partially finished." 

"Of course," I told him. "I'm still living in the trailer." 

He grinned. "Just make sure it stays there. I don't need my ass chewed out." 

"Last thing I want, believe me. I appreciate all the help. I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started." 

He nodded. "That's understandable. Not a lot of restoration of 220 year old mansions going on. You know, it's gorgeous. You did a hell of a job maintaining the exterior." 

"Didn't have to do much," I admitted. "Hard to believe how little damage there was to the outside walls. Only one chimney needs any work. The windows are a pain, I admit." 

"Whatever you're doing, keep it up. If you have any special issues, just let me know. We'll work it out. Don't keep me in the dark." 

I nodded. "Every step of the way. I promise. Hell, I need someone watching over my shoulder, last thing I need is to screw up big time. I can't afford it." 

I'll say this. I had never met so many helpful, generous people, as I did working on that old house. Andrew was just one of them, but easily the most important. Not only was he helpful, but he was keeping everyone else off my back. I owed him one, and once the place was a little more livable, I was determined to have him and his family over for a nice dinner and tour. 

The windows were in on the first floor, and I didn't have to worry about heat, with four large fireplaces on the main floor, and unlimited fire wood. A few hundred dollars for a chimney sweep had them cleaned out, and I was assured they were usable, but needed a lot of TLC, one in particular. I put a temporary trap door to the second floor in, and I had a spacious one floor apartment. 

With camcorder in hand, I toured the place, commenting on the work done, what remained to be finished, and naming each room. I was proud of the work I'd completed, and could see the place finally starting to come together. Beverly was ridiculously pleased with the video, and held regular showings of it in the TV room at her place. 

My company's fiscal year ended in October, and a week later I received a sizable end-of-year bonus, my largest yet, over $10K. It allowed me to purchase some additional furnishings, and to move forward with a small plan that had been developing in my mind. 

"Beverly?" 

"Jack! You're calling late. What's up?" 

"I think I'm about done for the year. I'll be doing some interior work on the upper floors, but probably won't get any major improvements accomplished until the spring." 

"That's a shame, you were making such good progress. Everyone here loves the video." 

"I think it's time for you to come out and see what I've done with the place. Would it be Ok for me to come out and get you next weekend, and let you view it?" 

"Do you have the time? It seems you could spend those days working on your house," she said. 

"I'd much rather spend a little time with you, to be honest. I'm worn out from burning the candle at both ends, and could use the rest. A friendly face would be nice to have around for a couple of days. Just let me know what you need, and I'll set you up a room." 

She fought my suggestion for a bit, but I knew her heart wasn't in it. She finally agreed to come out, but only if she could pay her own way. "You don't have to come get me, I'll have my nurse put me on the plane. If you could just meet me at the airport, I'll be fine." 

I argued but she insisted, and reminded me that I could pay for her flight when the place was finally finished. "I couldn't stand it knowing you spent your money on me, when you could be putting in another window, or completing a wall. I'll be alright. I'll send you the flight details as soon as I have them worked out." 

I spent that week sanding the rough hewn oak floors, sealing and staining them. I prepared a room for her, and another for myself, with a bed, drapes, linens, even a dresser and nightstand. I loved how the porch had turned out, and used a little of my funds to furnish it with a few rocking chairs, and a hanging bench swing out of an old movie. A couple of small tables to hold a drink or a book, some planters with fresh wild flowers to give it the homey look, and I considered it a job well down. Things were definitely coming together. 

On the Thursday before I was to pick her up, I took a long weekend and moved out of my rental. I had spent many nights in my trailer, but I was looking forward to my first night inside The House I'd practically rebuilt from scratch. 

I had a small blaze going in the fireplace, and was relaxing, telling myself I was going to do no work for the next four days, except for whatever problems showed up when I actually moved in. 

Electricity was available, but I wasn't ready to go through all the inspections it would require to get it turned on, nor the expense. I had a used diesel generator in an insulated shed out back that provided the minimum electricity I needed, especially for the small RV refrigerator and well pump. For lighting I used kerosene lamps, and I had a large propane tank out back for my kitchen stove and on demand water heater. I was almost embarrassed to put in some low- power LED light bulbs in the kitchen and bathroom, the new technology feeling so incongruent. 

I relaxed in a comfortable lounger in the living room, sipping on some hot chocolate, fighting off the evening chill. The old girl was still getting used to her new fittings. The wind through the upstairs floors was annoying, and The House was constantly creaking and settling, as the wood dried and all the changes slowly blended in. 

I wasn't used to the sounds of the night, the noisome animals, birds, and insects. I had somehow thought The House would be quiet and lonely, but it seemed alive with noises, and just outside my door were acres and acres of woods that hadn't seen this much change in scores of years. 

I went to bed that night exhausted to the bone, but with a huge smile on my face. I was living my dream. How many people can say that? 

I woke to the sound of my door creaking open, scaring the bejesus out of me. I was certain I had closed it. I got up and looked around but the front door was locked and bolted, and the windows were all shut. I checked the door latch, expecting some shoddy work on my part had left the recess misaligned, but it closed firmly. 

I closed the door again, checking it, and settled back down. Although everything was going well, I was feeling a moment of loneliness. I hadn't dated in over a year and was yearning for a woman's company. I closed my eyes and stroked myself slowly. I pulled back the sheets and let the cool air bathe my body. My hand moved casually, but I found myself getting very excited. Drafts of air seem to caress me, tantalizing the head of my cock while my hand stroked the shaft. The feelings were all to brief, as I came mightily, my essence pooling on my belly. I opened my eyes, and searched for something to clean up with, settling for my dirty shirt, before settling back down to sleep. Good thing I got that out of the way; wouldn't be appropriate behavior with my guest arriving in a couple of days. 

When I woke, the door was open again. What the hell was going on? I was going to have to check on that. I took my first indoor hot shower, and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the water heated up, and how crisp the water felt. No sulfur odor, no lack of water pressure. 

The House smelled wonderful, of fresh wood, and the fireplace. I walked around, king of my small domain, and made myself a large breakfast, another extravagant treat. I hadn't been eating as well as I should have, and the heavy manual labor had me dropping almost 15 pounds and tightening my belt. 

In spite of my promise to myself, I found an immediate problem. I hadn't made a ramp up to the entrance. A wide set of steps led up to the front porch and I spent the morning constructing a removable ramp I set in place over half the steps. Just in time. I spent a few more minutes walking around The House, opening doors, drawing back curtains, making the place look as open and bright as possible. 

I cooked myself a big fat hamburger with potato chips, still indulging myself. Afterward, I neatened up the kitchen, made myself presentable and headed out to the airport. Over two hours later, I was waiting in the terminal for Beverly to be rolled out by the airline attendants. 

I saw her before she saw me. She was in an airport wheelchair, dressed to the nines, and being pushed by a young woman. As soon as she was past the security area I rushed to her and gave her a hug. I felt like I knew her better than anybody else in my life, sharing the last 7 months with her, albeit by long distance. 

"Jack! You're skinny as a rail! And that tan looks like you just strolled off the beach." 

"Lots of hard outdoor work can do that to a guy. I feel great. Slept like a baby last night, in my new house for the first time," I told her proudly. 

"That's wonderful! I was surprised you waited this long. Jack, this is my nurse Karen. If it's alright by you, she'll stay with me. She can tend to my needs, knows how I like things, and remembers all that little stuff I can't be bothered with." 

"Like your meds? Speaking of which, it's about that time." The woman turned to me and stretched out a hand, which I shook. "Pleased to meet you Jack. You certainly have breathed new life into cranky here." 

"Cranky? Beverly? She's the sweetest, least cranky person I know!" 

"To you maybe." 

"Keep it up, Karen, and I'll cut you out of my will," Beverly warned. 

"Again? Isn't that the 3rd time this month?" 

"It'll stick this time." 

The nurse rolled her eyes, giving me a smile. "Yes ma'am. Sorry ma'am. Never happen again ma'am." 

"And none of that smarmy lip either, girl. You're the one that's always wanted to see D.C." 

Their easy banter betrayed a close companionship that I found myself jealous of. Then I smiled. If it made her happy, all the better. 

"Can I drive?" I asked, moving toward the handles of the wheelchair. 

"Please. I'm begging you," Karen laughed. 

We headed for the luggage area and waited for their bags to arrive. Her personal wheelchair was delivered, reassembled after the flight, and Karen prepared the pillows on it, before helping Beverly into it. 

I'd traded my Honda in for a used truck, when I'd started all the work. It was a crew cab, and we were able to place the luggage and wheelchair in the rear. Karen got in the back, and I lifted Beverly into the passenger seat. I was surprised how light she was, and wondered if it was hauling all that lumber around, or if she really was lighter than air.  

===

"You can put me in the truck now, Jack. Although I certainly don't mind being held by such a handsome young man." 

I was embarrassed I'd been standing there holding her, and set her into the cab. I was always a little surprised when she called me handsome. I knew better. Striking, maybe, with the large scar down the side of my jawbone, eyes too small and narrow, nose too wide. Wild hair which I could do nothing with and pretty much let it do whatever it would. No, not handsome. Still, it was nice to hear it from her. 

We were already in D.C. so I gave them a short driving tour of the monuments and downtown, pointing out all the famous landmarks and buildings, to their contented oohs, and aahs. Then we headed south. It was a long drive, so we broke it up, stopping at a Cracker Barrel for dinner. From there it was less than an hour before I was turning up my private entrance, no trespassing signs displayed boldly. 

"So this is your new road?" Beverly asked, as we bounced our way up the hill. 

"It needs some work, but paving it will probably be the last thing I get around to, if I can help it. We'll be on it for a while, almost half a mile, and my initial quotes are over $30K to get it done." 

"Would gravel work?" Karen asked from in back. 

"Yeah, and that might be an alternative if the winter proves too much. Still pretty pricey, and then the whole expense is lost when I finally get around to paving it." 

"Awfully secluded out here," she said, looking at the encroaching trees. The canopy was dense, letting little light through. 

"Nearest neighbor is about a mile up the road. I've only met a couple of them. Nothing but farmland across the way. The nearest town is only about 8 miles away." 

We drove that last bit in quiet, before the road opened up, crested the hill, and The House came in view. 

"It's magnificent!" Beverly exclaimed. 

"It's huge!" Karen chimed in afterwards. 

I pulled up in front, and we unloaded the wheelchair and escorted Beverly into The House for the first time. 

"It's beautiful," she said softly, looking around. 

It was dusk, and we only had a few minutes of daylight left. I set about lighting the kerosene lamps and getting the fireplaces going. The library and sitting room were our makeshift bedrooms, and each had its own fireplace. The huge living area hosted another one, as did the dining room. Only the kitchen at the back of The House was left without. With fires crackling and popping in all four rooms, I finally had time for my guests. 

Karen had brought in the bags, and settled Beverly in front of the living room fireplace, where she could watch our actions while staying warm. 

"Your pictures didn't do the place justice," Beverly told me, when I finally settled into my lounge chair near her. 

"That's why you had to see it in person." 

"Are you happy with how it's going?" 

"Beyond happy. I'm just aggravated it's taking so long. I imagine it'll be a couple of years before I'm done with this place. Of course, a house like this one will never be really done." 

Karen was preparing tea in my kitchen, making herself at home. For the first time I wondered what it would feel like to share this place with a woman. Someone, hopefully, that loved the place as much as I did. 

"You've done an amazing job here. It must have been a lot of work. The woodwork alone must have been exorbitant," Karen said. 

"All the wood is from the property. Mostly hardwoods. I know a heck of a lot more about trees and wood then I thought I'd ever have to. Come spring I may thin out some of the woods, and sell the trees off to the lumber mill. I may even make enough to pave that road, who knows?" 

"How much land is it?" Karen asked. 

"Nearly 500 acres. Over a mile of road frontage, and well over half-a-mile deep. We've even got a creek on it, but I haven't been down there yet." 

Beverly had been quiet, but seemed to wake up a bit. "You're doing a wonderful thing here, Jack. This place seemed so sad, so forlorn, and you've managed to breathe life back into it. It was a shame for us to let it go so." 

"You've been here, then?" 

"Twice, a long, long time ago. Once as a young girl for my Uncle's wedding. It was amazing. So big, so beautiful. It was old even then. He restored it for his wife, who was from Philadelphia. Then years later, after he passed away, I came out once to see it after I'd inherited it. I couldn't stand to be here, it was so dreary and gloomy. They'd only lived in it for a little over a year when the fire happened. Uncle Donald was out of town. Aunt Mary and little Elizabeth were trapped on the top floor nursery and couldn't get out. When the volunteer fire department showed up, they found them dead outside the house. She'd jumped from a window rather than burn. Aunt Mary was still holding Elizabeth. It destroyed Uncle Donald when he found out. He was never the same. Never got re- married. Not that he gave up on women. He was a black sheep for a while, leaving a series of bastards in his wake. Great gossip for the family, but I could never feel anything but sorry for him. He left the place as it was, refusing to sell it or fix it. It sat here empty for at least 75 years now. Such a shame." 

"That's so sad!" Karen exclaimed at the end. 

"It is, but even sad stories can have happy endings. I think Jack is just the man to make this a happy place once again. He's certainly made a wonderful start of it." 

We didn't last much past that. Karen put Beverly to bed while I cleaned up a bit, and she joined me in the living room. 

"I'm sorry I didn't know you were coming. I would have bought another bed. You can sleep in my room, and I'll take the couch," I offered. 

"I'll be fine on the couch. That way I'll hear if Bev needs me in the night. Besides, I don't think you'd fit on the couch." 

She had me there. She was small, only about 5'2" and I'm near 6'1". She had a better chance of squeezing in than I did. 

I gave her some blankets and a pillow off my bed, and left her. "Thanks for coming. She seems comfortable around you." 

She came over to me and pulled me down for a kiss on the cheek. "She's more alive than I've ever seen her. It's you and your project, filling her with joy. You're a good man, Jack." 

"It's been good for both of us. Goodnight Karen." 

"'Night Jack. Sweet dreams." 

* * * 

I loved my home, but it was doing weird things to my brain. Once again I awoke in the night, and my door was open. I got up and checked on the ladies, both sleeping soundly. I closed the door firmly, determined that I would do something about that when my company was gone, and tried to get back to sleep. 

I was restless, and the sounds of The House weren't helping. I heard a regular creaking noise, and sat up in bed to see my rocking chair rocking back and forth. While I was staring at it, it slowly stopped moving, making me wonder if I'd been seeing things. Maybe a draft from the fireplace. Weird. 

Lying back down, I felt my need arising again. I wasn't at an age where I felt I had to relieve myself daily; I suspect it had something to do with the young lady sleeping on my couch. Either way, I was feeling horny, and my rod was already at half-staff. I closed my eyes, casually playing with myself, while I drifted in that space between half-awake and half-asleep. My consciousness was slipping away, but the feeling below my waist was intensifying. My mind was playing tricks with me, and I thought I felt somebody settling onto the bed. I opened my eyes and glanced at the empty bed beside me, and at the closed door to my room. 

Nothing. Door shut. Just the empty house messing with me. 

Looking down, I was hard as a rock, and the crown was bright red as if on the verge of coming. I settled back down, mocking myself for my behavior, and made an effort to finish what I'd started. I stroked myself firmly, letting the cool air caress the sensitive head, which was feeling incredible. When I could hold back no longer, I released, pumping hard, until the throbbing stopped. Looking down, I was surprised to see how little I'd come, just a little stickiness on the head and dripping down my hand. Nothing like the torrent from the night before. I guess that in spite of the intensity of it, I wasn't in the same recovery mode as I'd been as a teenager. 

* * * 

I awoke to the smell of coffee and bacon. I breathed deep, stretching. It smelled so good. So right. 

I was cold, and found I'd kicked off the covers in the night, and I was lying there with an embarrassing hard-on. I threw on some pajamas, in deference to my guests, added a heavy terrycloth robe, in order to hide my condition down below, and made my appearance. 

Karen laughed when she saw me. "I thought that might wake you, sleepy head. Why don't you wash up and then you can set the table?" 

Bev was on the front porch, enjoying the early morning. I went out and greeted her, leaning down and kissing her on the cheek. "Good morning, beautiful." 

She giggled and swatted at me. "I'm immune to flattery young man." 

"Just stating the truth. Having you two here makes everything so perfect. The House seems like a home." 

"It's nice," she sighed. "I'd almost forgotten." 

"I'm going to clean up now, breakfast will be ready in a few minutes." 

"Thank you. Now run along. A grown man in a robe and pajamas? What is the world coming to?" 

I went as fast as I could, and was setting the table in record time. Karen was laying out scrambled eggs, toast, pancakes and bacon. A veritable feast. I got my knuckles smacked for pilfering a piece of the crispy, thick cut meat-candy. 

"Wait your turn, bucko. Why don't you bring in Bev? And be careful, she's cranky in the morning." 

"Who are you talking about? She's the sweetest, kindest thing." 

She rolled her eyes at me, an ability she'd perfected. "Go on now. Before it gets cold." 

I wheeled Beverly in and sat her at the head of the table. We consumed our feast, and I plead no contest to the claim I ate more than half by myself. I asked what they wanted to do, and Beverly made it clear she planned to relax on the porch. Karen was happy enough to explore the area, and see the sealed off upstairs. 

After breakfast we set Bev up outside with a table and a pot of tea. The woman loved her tea. I also made sure she had her cell phone which miraculously had reasonable reception where we were. Then Karen and I dressed for hiking and decided to explore the woods a bit around the place. 

It was nice, walking and chatting with her, exchanging bits of our backgrounds, and a love for the outdoors. We made a series of small forays, returning to The House regularly to check on Bev. 

Bev was enjoying a book and the fresh air, and shooed us away each time we returned. 

"If you don't leave me alone for at least an hour, I swear I won't be responsible for my actions!" she finally announced, giving us our marching orders. 

We decided to hike down to the road and back, and I was surprised to find myself getting hungry after all the walking. I pointed out several of the different types of trees to Karen, who picked up on the differences quickly, pointing out various specimens on our return hike. 

"What did she charge you for this, if you don't mind my asking? She's notoriously stingy, and it must have cost a pretty penny. Do you come from money?" 

"Money? I come from foster homes. Six of them growing up. No, I don't come from money. I didn't realize quite how large the property was, and I was hoping just to buy The House and access to it, but she signed over the whole place." 

"Now you've got me curious. What was it, the Lotto? Did you cash in on one of those internet startups? Spill." 

I laughed. "I never got to make an offer. She sold it to me for a dollar." 

That stopped her in her tracks. "One dollar! But...that's crazy!" 

"That's what I said, but her lawyer backed her on it. The only condition was that I kept her up-to-date on the progress, which I would gladly have done anyway." 

She started walking again, shaking her head. "Old Bev is full of surprises, isn't she?" We walked along in silence for a bit, before she spoke up again. "Best deal she ever made." 

"How's that?" 

"She was wasting away. We thought she'd pretty much given up on life, and then you came along. She could talk of nothing else each day except what you were working on, and how the house was coming. She was a delight to be with after every one of your phone calls. I've known her for several years and have never seen her happier. She deserves a little happiness. She's a good soul." 

"It's been good for me, too. It's nice to have someone to share this with. She's the closest to family I've ever had, and I've known her maybe seven months. Hard to believe." 

"It is hard to believe. Hard to believe you don't have someone to share this with. No special someone in your life." 

"My own fault. Too driven to get through college, working and studying. Too focused on success at business, paying off my loans, working two jobs for three long years. Too fixated on this house for the last couple of years. I wouldn't have been good company." 

"Thinking of settling down a bit now?" 

I laughed. "Not for a while. Everything I have is tied up in The House. I'm broke, and will have to work hard to scrape together the next 100 grand it'll take to finish this place the way I want. No, I think I'll be busy a while longer." 

She skipped to the side of the road and returned with one of the last fall wildflowers. "You've got to stop and smell the roses occasionally. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." She smelled the flower and held it to my nose. When I went to smell it she pushed it in my face and took off running up the road, laughing. 

I caught her after a short ways, and grabbed her, swinging her off the ground. "Dull boy? You are a troublemaker aren't you?" 

She struggled in my arms for a second then twisted toward me. I was shocked when she gave me a quick kiss, and almost fell when I released her. 

"Impertinent boy! I'm going to tell Bev how you manhandled me." She was skipping up the road backwards, wagging her finger at me. 

I jogged up next to her. "Do it and I'll tell her you kissed me." 

"You're rotten! I did no such thing. You kissed me!" 

"Keep it up, devil-girl, and I'll do it again." 

She took off running. "You'd have to catch me first!" 

Ornery thing. Karen wasn't a kid, I'd guess early thirties, probably had me by a couple of years, but I couldn't help smile at her playful antics. She had a full figure, and when she ran any red-blooded man would recognize how womanly that figure was, with a narrow waist, wide full hips, and tapered legs. Definitely worth catching. 

Catch her I did, and when she turned to me I leaned down and kissed her, longer this time. She came into my arms, hugging me, returning my kiss. She pulled away, catching my hand in hers. "Ok Romeo, I won't tell if you don't. Deal?" 

I was still surprised at my own actions. It took me a few seconds to come to grips with myself. I gave her hand a squeeze. "Deal." 

I was nearly 30 years old, and felt like I was fifteen all over again. Holding hands with a girl at the skating ring, going around and around in circles, never wanting the evening to end. Alas, at the end of the road she dropped my hand and jogged up to The House. 

"How's it going, cranky-puss?" 

"Where have you two been? Leaving me alone up here for hours on end! You're just in time. If you'll help me to the restroom I won't embarrass myself." 

I checked the time. We'd been gone 55 minutes. 

Karen leaned down and gave her a hug. "I'm sorry, Sweetie. We lost track of the time. Let's get you inside." 

Beverly reached up and patted her hand, as she was wheeled indoors. "So long as you two had a nice time." 

"He's a handful, but it was nice." 

* * * 

After lunch Bev took a nap, and I opened up the top floors and showed Karen around. She was suitably impressed with the open layout and the work done so far. The third floor was a little sparser, with the floor and ceiling unfinished, and I'd left it completely open. She even wanted to see the attic, so we headed up the last narrow stairwell and she got her wish. 

Back on the third floor, she walked around the room. "I wonder which window it was." 

I hadn't thought about it, but gave it some consideration. "It looked like the worst of the fire was in the front of The House. It was probably one of the rear windows." 

She had stopped at the single window on the east side of The House. "I don't think so. I think it was this one." 

"Really? Why?" 

"I don't know. I just do." She shivered. "Can we go back down now?" 

"Of course." 

Back on the main floor, she asked me what my next project was going to be. 

"I'm going to start on the second floor, room by room, and when that's done, I'll get going on the top floor. I'll probably run the wiring myself, then bring in an electrician to sign it off. I'm still not too comfortable with plumbing. I guess I'll wait for the spring to bring my plumber Charlie in to finish that up. Maybe I'll be able to afford it by then." 

"You've got your work cut out for you. That's for sure." 

"Yeah, but you know, I enjoy doing it. It makes me happy to see it slowly come together. The House feels more alive with every board I lay, every nail I drive. Sometimes I forget I need to sleep and work long into the night." 

"That's good. You're right about the house. It's like it's alive. Watching us, while it slowly heals under your care." 

I laughed. "I don't mean alive like living, just, I don't know, alive." 

She just shrugged. "I don't know what I'm thinking. At least it seems friendly. For the most part." 

"For me, I'm surprised how cozy the downstairs feels, with all that stone and open space." 

"It's nice. You've made it that way." She wandered away from me and went to Bev who was awake and letting us know it. 

I had opened a few of the windows, to let the air in, and walked around partially closing them, as the day cooled a bit. I still loved the fresh air, and would take it hands down over the muggy city atmosphere. Being a couple of hundred feet higher than the surrounding area appeared to help a lot. 

Bev looked good, her cheeks pinking up, her eyes bright. "It's a different world up here. A different time. You can almost forget all the bad things going on elsewhere," she said. 

Karen agreed. "No doubt. I could be anywhere, not an hour and a half away from D.C." 

"We've talked so much about your plans for the house, what are you planning for outdoors?" Beverly asked. 

"Hadn't given it much thought. I wouldn't mind having a nice garden up here some day. I've also thought about clearing a few more trees off the southeast side. From the roof, you can see for miles. In that direction, if I opened it up, I could look out from the porch and see nothing but trees and farms almost to the river. To the south and west, I'd like to leave them as they are, blocking the view and the sound of the highway." 

Karen liked the idea, and I found myself interested in her opinion. "Have you thought about clearing the area around that huge oak tree to the northeast? It could be so picturesque. Maybe put a bench underneath it?" 

"Hadn't thought about it, but it wouldn't be too tough to do. A couple of days work, and I can always use the wood." 

"Can I see this tree?" Beverly asked. 

I'd be hard pressed to ever say no to her. 

We took her out, and gave her a tour of the area, as much as we could within her transport limitations. The old oak was huge, and had successfully held its own against the encroaching wild. The lowest branches could have been trees on their own, stretching out sideways, fighting for space. In some ways the tree was much like The House. Standing strong and solitary, taking whatever time and nature threw at it, and weathering it all.  

===

Bev asked to take a break under the tree and we parked her there, while we sat on the ground nearby. We talked about her past, her childhood, what the country was like in the thirties and forties. 

She had been in love, married young, and her husband of eight months joined the nascent Army Air Forces after Pearl Harbor. He'd died over the skies of Europe, and she'd never married again. 

"It wasn't for lack of trying. I met some wonderful men, but they always dimmed in comparison to my Bill. I led an exciting life, but it was often lonely. I wouldn't wish that on anyone." 

I understood her feelings. I'd grown up alone, and figured it was a part of life. Even the few relationships I'd shared did little to ameliorate my feelings of isolation. In truth, the odd relationship I had with Beverly was the one thing in the last 1/2 dozen years that had kept my loneliness at bay. 

I reached my hand over and placed it on her knee. "I hope you're not feeling too lonely. I'd like to think that we'll be friends for a long time." 

She smiled, patting my hand. "I'd like that. The last several months have been very nice, and this weekend has been wonderful. I'm so glad I let you talk me into coming." 

Karen added her $.02. "Ditto to that. This has been a great break. I can't tell you how happy I am you decided to share it with me." 

We broke up our little party, as the day slipped away. We rolled Beverly back in The House, and cranked up the fireplaces. Karen took over in the kitchen. 

"Anything in the refrigerator off limits?" she asked. 

"Hardly. Everything's fair game. If you need anything that's not in there, it's about 40 minutes round trip to hit the store." 

"I think I can manage with what you've stocked. You've got enough food in here to feed an army. Any special requests, Bev?" 

Beverly shook her head. "Surprise me, and don't hold back - no diet tonight." 

I was happy enough to sit back and chat with Bev while Karen took care of the dinner. I felt decadent, letting her do the work while I took it easy. It was a feeling I could get used to. 

The aroma of meat cooking in olive oil and garlic was combating the fresh smell of the outdoors, where it was doing some serious ass-kicking, and even putting up a decent defense against the fragrant fires burning freely in all four fireplaces. So different from my antiseptic work place, and the stench of the city. 

Beverly was watching me, as I inhaled deeply. "I know." She closed her eyes and breathed as deeply as she could. "It's great to be able to draw a line between yourself and the rat-race." 

Amen to that. 

I was asking her about her extended family, which she had casually mentioned earlier. "No, nobody very close. Some distant children and grandchildren of my cousins, haven't heard from any of them in years. My cousin Angela was the last to stay in touch. I've left a little something for all of them in my will, kind of spiteful. Just enough to let them know I was there, and if they look into it, they'll see a bunch of charities getting what might have been theirs, if they'd cared enough. A phone call or even a Christmas card would have been nice. I guess I shouldn't expect so much. Nobody writes anymore. It's email this, facebook that, and twittle notes, just blabbing your life and personal affairs to the world, and never really connecting. I sometimes think I've lived just a little too long." 

I shook my head. "I know it might sound selfish, but I hope you live many more years, and come and visit as often as possible. You bring The House alive." 

She laughed softly. "It's sweet of you to say so, Jack. But it's the young girl in the kitchen livening this place up." 

"Hardly. She's a guest, and nice to have around, but as far as I'm concerned, you're family. At least the closest I've ever had." 

She reached out and held my hand, squeezing it softly. I was getting all mushy. Too much time away from the big tools. I needed to go out and fell a tree, get my testosterone going again. 

Before it could get too maudlin, Karen called to me from the kitchen. "Alright, slacker. Why don't you drag your cute butt in here and set the table? Dinner's only a few minutes away." 

Cute butt? The woman was delusional. 

I set about getting the table ready, peeking at Karen's culinary effort. A simple Italian dinner, she had meatballs, meat sauce, spaghetti, bruschetta, and was browning some Italian sausage. I hope she'd cooked a lot. It smelled divine. 

Dinner tasted even better than it smelled, and I stuffed myself to the point of bursting. Beverly couldn't praise Karen enough on all she'd pulled together, and I think she was getting embarrassed from all the compliments. 

"C'mon Bev, it's just spaghetti and meatballs. No big deal." 

"Best I've eaten in ages," I managed to blurt out between bites of sausage. 

"That I believe. You eat like a starving lumberjack," Karen laughed. Hers was a strong, throaty laugh, and I liked the sound of it. A lot. I'd have to see what I could do to make her laugh more often. 

"Hey! I'm only trying to make you feel appreciated. Wouldn't want any of this to go to waste." 

"If I ate like that, you'd have to roll me away from the table, without the benefit of a fancy chair like Bev has. More like Violet in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." 

"So if I squeezed you, I'd get blueberry juice?" I teased. 

"Well I guess you'll just have to try it and see what you get," she shot back. She had a devilish look in her eye that had me blushing. 

"Karen, don't tease the boy. I don't think he's been around this much womanhood in a month of Sundays." 

"I hear it, but I don't believe it. I bet he's a heart-breaker in disguise. A wolf in lumberjack's clothing." 

After dinner I cleaned up, fair's fair, while the ladies enjoyed their coffee and tea. We tried our hand at Hearts for a while, and I got to hear a little about Karen's past. She'd married young, no kids, and it had fallen apart early. She'd gone back to school for her RN, and worked for a couple of years in a large hospital before she got tired of the long hours and lousy shifts. 

She'd then spent another couple of years as a traveling nurse, seeing the world before she got tired of the frequent travel, and turned to the upscale nursing home where Beverly was. 

"She's the best in our place, no doubt about it," Beverly said. "It took some real finagling on my part to get her away from there for this trip." 

"Hell, Bev. You and Weird John are the only things that keep me in that place." 

I got to hear about Weird John, the conspiracy nut, and his dealings with aliens and UFOs, as well as his secret government background, which gave him an encyclopedic knowledge of the world, at least the Post WWII, pre-80's version. 

They had me almost rolling on the floor, hearing some of his escapades, but I should have been paying more attention to the cards. The ladies were teaming up against me, and I was getting whipped. We were playing for pennies, and I was already six bucks in the hole. 

We bundled up Beverly in a blanket and retreated to the porch, where I indulged in a small Scotch and a cigar, with the ladies' permission. 

"I wouldn't have taken you for a cigar smoker," Bev observed. 

"It's pretty rare. Maybe a half-dozen a year. But this seems as good an occasion as any, breaking in my new porch." 

We enjoyed the crisp, cool evening air. I don't think I'd ever opened up to anyone as much as I did with those two. It was just so easy, so comfortable, like I'd known them for years. 

My childhood had not been a happy one, and it wasn't something I ever talked about, but between the two of them, they managed to squeeze most of my past out of me. 

"It's hard to picture you as a delinquent," Karen remarked. 

"Yeah, my counselors told me I was just trying to get attention. Luckily I got tired of the schooling, and detention, and joined the Army at 17. Four years as a Ranger straightened me up, and Uncle Sam paid for me to get a degree. Took less than 3 years, turned out I wasn't quite as dumb as I'd been led to believe." 

Bev looked at me like I'd grown a second head. "Army? You are full of surprises, aren't you?" 

"It's not for everybody, but it was good for me. I loved being a Ranger, belonging to something where my past didn't matter beans. Do your job, keep your nose clean, be willing to take a lot of crap the first year, and it's not a bad gig. I made some real friends for the first time in my life. Thought about making a career of it, but I still felt I was missing out on something." 

I took a long puff, playing at blowing smoke rings. "I always felt like an outsider, a transient, never fitting in. Until I stood in front of The House. From that moment I knew, absolutely, without a doubt knew where I belonged, and what my purpose was. I'm lucky. I doubt one in a thousand people get to follow their dream and live with purpose." 

Turning to Bev, I took her cool hand in mine. "I...I'll never be able to thank you enough for giving me this chance. It would have killed me if I hadn't been able to do this. You need to know this is the kindest, most generous thing anyone's ever done for me. Ever could do. I'll never be able to repay you." 

Bev squeezed my hand, smiling gently. "Don't be foolish, Jack. You gave me my life back. Finish restoring the old girl, and we'll call it even." 

We chatted a bit more about nothing much. It didn't matter. Sitting on that porch, with them, was about as good as it gets. Nearly 30 years old, and I finally understood what it was to be content, to have family, and to belong. 

Bev reminded us it was getting late, and I gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek, while Karen settled her in. I moved to the swinging bench I'd installed, taking the blanket and the last couple of inches of cigar with me. I told myself it was just getting more comfortable, but down deep I hoped that Karen would respond to the invitation. 

I needn't have worried. When she walked out to the porch, she glanced at my empty chair, then looked over and found me on the porch swing. She smiled as she walked over and I lifted the blanket in invitation. Karen settled in next to me, nuzzling up close, as I pulled the blanket over her. 

"How is she?" 

"Exhausted but ridiculously happy. She looks better then she has in ages. I suspect the fresh air and good company has a lot to do with it." 

"I imagine the meals aren't hurting. I haven't eaten this well in, heck, I can't remember how long it's been. Maybe ever." 

"Good," she said softly resting her head on my shoulder. "I feel a little like a squatter here, and it's nice to think I can contribute in some small way." 

I maneuvered an arm around her shoulders and hugged her close. "Don't think that way. Your presence here is a delightful surprise. I can't believe how easy you are to be around. It's like I've known you for years." 

She giggled. "It seems like I've known you for months. You know you're all she talks about. If I had to sit through that video of 'The House' one more time, I think I'd have done something rash. And yet all I knew of you was that voice of yours, your words, and your work on the place. In the future you might want to figure out a way to get yourself into some of the pictures. You are nothing like I'd pictured." 

"Oh really? And how did you imagine me?" 

"Shorter. Rounder. Older. Balder." 

"Ouch! Is that what I sound like? I guess old Bev didn't paint a very flattering portrait of me." 

"But she did! I mean, according to her you were some Greek God, fallen to earth, or maybe a Hercules, half God, half man, able to undertake any task, no matter how impossible. I figured it for hyperbole. I mean, really? Tall dark and handsome, keeps his promises to an old woman half a country away, and restoring a mansion from scratch, with little more than desire and a Swiss-army knife? Come on!" 

I had to laugh. "I'll have you know my Swiss-army knife is the deluxe edition." 

She giggled along with me, and we settled into a comfortable silence for a while. 

"Jack?" 

"Hmmm?" I answered quietly, realizing I'd been halfway to falling asleep. 

"I know I was a little silly on our hike today, maybe even a bit brazen. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm not trying to come on strong, but it's just been such a delightful couple of days." 

I gave her another hug, or tried to, realizing my arm was falling asleep. "I loved every minute of it. It's been nothing but work for me for too long now. Your attitude is contagious. I haven't been this happy in a long, long time." I struggled to move my arm a little to restore the circulation, but she made it easy for me by turning sideways and lying down in my lap. 

"I'm glad. I know our time is short, and I may never see you again, but as silly as it seems, I'm having the time of my life here with you." She surprised me by taking my hand, which was resting on her belly, and moving it up to her breast. It filled my hand nicely, and I gave it a gentle squeeze. 

She closed her eyes, and I stroked her hair while I caressed her. I felt myself hardening, embarrassed that my erection would be pushing against her head. She just smiled a little, and turned her face toward my stomach, rubbing her cheek against my hardness. "Mmmm," she whispered, "Is that for me?" 

"You're driving me crazy," I confessed. 

"Li'l ole me? Why? I'm just lyin' here, doing nothin'." Her exaggerated southern drawl was fuel to the fire. 

"And you're doing it incredibly well." 

She finally opened her eyes, and I could see I'd lit a fire inside her. "I think it's time for bed. Shall we?" 

* * * 

I closed the door to my room quietly, nervously. She was sitting on the bed, observing. 

"I have to admit, I feel a little awkward with Bev right next door," I said. 

She gave me a knowing smile. "I understand. But believe me, she'd approve. Hell, she'd eagerly take my place if the excitement wouldn't kill her." 

We undressed each other quietly, slowly, taking the time to get acquainted with each other's bodies. When I had her naked I pulled her into my arms and gave her the kiss I'd been thinking about all afternoon. She molded herself to me, and kissed me deeply, completely. I was mesmerized. 

We climbed into my bed and it was like we were old lovers. The awkwardness was gone, and we spent an eternity just getting comfortable with each other. When she went down on me, I had to pull the covers back to watch, carefully ensuring they still covered her, keeping her warm. 

It was a delightful, intimate act. She wasn't working to get me off, she was just enjoying herself, playfully familiarizing herself with my most private part, occasionally looking up to bask in my adoration. 

Then she was climbing on top of me, sliding my hardness inside of her. She sighed as she settled onto it, taking my full length. "God, it's so nice, so hard, so smooth, so perfect. Like its owner in so many ways." 

She had me blushing. Surprising for the intimate position we were in. "Believe me, whatever you're feeling can't hold a candle next to what I've got going on here. You are amazing." 

She ceased her rocking and laid down on my body, while my hand caressed her bare back down to her delightfully full ass. "That's nice to hear. I was worried I might not even remember how to do this. It's been a while." 

"You needn't have worried," I assured her, holding her butt while I thrust up into her slowly and steadily. "You are incredible. God's truth. I can't believe how wonderful I feel here with you." 

She gasped when I thrust into her harder. "Jesus, and to think I almost turned the old biddy down! Fuck me, Jack." 

The eternity of foreplay, and the leisurely suck had me nearly on edge. Being inside of her, and having her so completely was just too much to bear. I pounded into her as hard as I could from our position. "I'm so close," I groaned. 

"Come in me. Let me feel it, come for me Jack. I want to feel you come inside of me," she whispered into my ear. 

It set me off, and I filled her, erupting powerfully, thrusting up hard and lifting her hips with each needful burst. 

Gasping, I slowed to a halt, holding her tightly in my arms. "Amazing," I told her, turning her chin up so I could kiss her softly. 

She slid off of my body to the side, holding me close, her leg over mine, her wetness pressing into my thigh. I felt a breeze, and pulled the covers over us. They'd somehow ended up almost completely off, barely covering us from the knees down. 

I looked over at the open doorway. Damn. I'd have to fix that. What if Bev had been up and about? 

In the middle of the night, I found myself half-awake, and fully aroused. Her hands were cool and soft, barely touching me, but my response was anything but cool. I felt a burning fire in my loins, and groaned while she got me off. So intense, so powerful, after what we'd been through earlier. I moaned my pleasure, and thanked her softly, before drifting back asleep. 

* * * 

I awoke with a start, hard again. I reached for her, but the bed was cold and empty. Again, the covers were completely astrewn. I looked toward the doorway, but it was firmly shut. I could hear movement outside, and smelled fresh coffee. 

I half wondered if the night before had only been a dream. 

I put on a pair of boxers and my robe, and answered the call of coffee. 

Bev was already seated at the table, enjoying her morning tea, and nibbling on a piece of toast. She was dressed nicely, her hair coiffed immaculately, always so proper. Made me feel like a bit of a lout, wearing only a robe. I went over and gave her a kiss on the cheek good morning, then went and got a cup of the coffee, peeking at Karen parked over a pan of pancakes in the making. 

"Good morning," I said hesitantly. 

She turned and gave me a big smile and a wink. 

I was confused and hesitant. I had no idea what to do next. It wasn't like it was a situation I was used to. So I just stood drinking my coffee, taking sidelong looks at the little vixen who'd rocked my world. 

"Please!" Bev sighed. "In my day, when a boy and girl did what you guys did in the night, he'd at least give her a kiss in the morning." 

I felt myself blushing hard, but it gave me the excuse I wanted. I gave Karen a hug, and a short sweet kiss. "She's right you know." 

Karen pulled me back down for a more thorough kiss, before turning back to her task at hand. "Clean up a bit, breakfast's almost ready." 

I obeyed, beating a retreat. I imagined my breath was nowhere near as fresh as hers had been. 

I was closing the door, when I heard Karen address Bev. "Yes we did, and yes it was incredible. Satisfied, nosy?" 

I couldn't hear the reply from behind the door, and tried to block it out as I washed my face, brushed my teeth, swiped a razor across my face, and ran a brush through my unruly hair. 

I sat down next to Bev, and helped myself to a stack of pancakes, while Karen took a seat across from me. 

"Next time, could you at least leave my door open? Do you know how hard it is to listen through these walls? Jack, I think you might have done too good a job there." 

I almost choked on that first bite. 

"Wouldn't you prefer a front row view? We could park you right beside the bed if you'd like," Karen asked sweetly, finishing the job Bev had started, leaving me choking and coughing and grabbing for my juice. 

Bev took it in stride. "I'm not sure if this old ticker could handle it, but I dare say it might be worth it. Of course I wouldn't want to cramp your style." 

Karen abruptly looked serious. She reached out and took Bev's free hand in hers. "Seriously. Anything you want. I owe you for this one." 

That finally got to her and Bev blushed. "I'm just teasing, you little hussy!" She turned her attention to me. "I really am glad that you guys found some comfort in each other." She put her tea down, reached out for my hand, and placed Karen's hand in mine.  

===

"And now I owe you twice," I told her. "First for giving me this wonderful place to fix up, and now bringing this sexy, saucy wench into my home." 

I guess she wasn't quite done teasing. "I'm just glad you were up to both tasks." 

Karen rolled her eyes, "Keep it up, old woman, and I'll see what kind of meds I can slip you to give us a little privacy." 

Bev heaved an exaggerated sigh. "Privacy? Again with the privacy? And I thought we were making progress." 

Fortunately that was the end of the teasing, and we discussed what we could do with our last full day together. They were leaving the following morning, but I didn't really want to think about it. 

We settled for a relaxing morning of doing nothing, followed by a picnic under our immense ancient oak. 

After lunch, Bev confessed to being a little tired, and asked for a nap. We were only too happy to accommodate her. 

Karen and I hadn't had more than a couple of moments alone all morning, and I desperately wanted to share some time with her. I loved the old woman, more than I thought possible in such a short time, but wouldn't mind spending a couple of hours away from her. 

Karen put together a snack and grabbed a tote bag, while I did a little maintenance of the fireplaces. Then we headed out for a walk. She wanted to see the stream I'd mentioned. I warned her it might be a bit of a hike, and got a machete out of the trailer to deal with any overgrowth. 

We chatted amiably, mostly about The House, what work I intended to do over the winter, and about old Bev. The walk was a bit strenuous, including climbing over and under logs, and cutting our way through the underbrush in a few places. Our conversation turned to both of our jobs before too long. 

The stream wasn't that far away, we soon found out, not more than a couple of hundred yards from the hilltop. Easy enough to find, we just walked downhill until we hit it. We reached the water at a point where we had about a 5 foot drop. Looking up and down the bank from where we stood, it looked like there was a more open area a short ways downstream. We cut back into the woods, and worked our way downhill, towards the main road. 

We spotted the opening, an incredibly huge tree dominating a space probably 100 feet across. We approached it in awed silence, the trunk easily as broad as the old oak by The House, and stretching to the sky. The smooth bark and incredible size made its identification easy. "Beech, largest I've ever seen," I informed my pretty companion. 

"My God, it's gigantic!" she gushed. 

I walked around the massive trunk, which forked into several secondary trunks, each as big as the enormous oak near The House. The trunk at its base must have been over 6 feet in diameter. There were numerous other beeches in the immediate area, but none half as large. There was an area 40 feet or more around the base of the tree, where almost nothing grew. I looked around more carefully, and recognized that the woods had changed dramatically, down near the stream. It was ancient, probably as old as our country. Maybe older. The floor was clear of growth except for thick moss and ferns, a fallen log nearly as tall as me stretching across the running stream. It was incredibly beautiful. 

"Can you imagine how ancient this tree is? The things it's seen? It must be hundreds of years old." 

"No kidding. I bet it's even older than Bev!" Karen laughed. 

I was running my hand around the trunk, and stopped. "Come here, you've got to see this." 

Karen hustled over and gasped when she saw where I was pointing. A huge heart had been carved into the tree, nearly two feet wide, with Don + Mary etched in its center. The carving was so old the letters had stretched until each was an inch wide, and had mostly healed over, making it difficult to read. I watched her reach out, her fingers tracing the heart's outline. 

"I guess we're not the first ones to find this tree," she said softly. 

"Sad," I murmured. "He must have loved her a lot. Built this beautiful home for her, and then never returned to it." 

Karen nodded. "This is a beautiful place. The running water, the open space, the shade of the tree, the thick moss under foot. Like a fairy tale." 

She was turning slowly, taking in the atmosphere of this magical locale. She faced me and smiled, slipping into my arms. "Thank you for this. I'll never, ever forget it." 

I leaned down and kissed her, and let her pull me down to the forest floor. The moss underfoot was nature's softest pillow. Our kissing intensified, and my hands explored her wonderful body. 

"Make love to me, Jack. Here, in this cathedral." She sat up and slid her shirt off, then reached back and undid her bra. 

I took off my shirt and placed it on the ground, moving her onto it. She giggled, pulling out of my hands, and pulling a blanket out of her tote bag. She passed it to me, and we stretched it out on the bed of moss. We each continued disrobing until we were naked in each other's arms again. 

She chuckled. 

"What?" I asked, smiling at her joyfulness. 

"We've got an audience," she said, pointing. 

About 10 feet away, a large black squirrel was perched on its hind legs, watching us. 

"He's going to get a show," I teased. 

She rolled onto her back, opening her legs for me. "Promise?" 

I moved over her, ready. "Absolutely." I rubbed my stiffness against her, pressing between her moist lips. I could hear her wetness. She was more than ready. 

It was beautiful, making love to her in the open air, feeling the breeze against our bodies, hearing nature all around us. The moss was incredible, so soft underneath us, making the experience dreamlike. The sound of the running water was a comforting constant in the background. 

I felt strong and refreshed. The feeling of being inside her was amazing. I was pumping her easily, long firm strokes, no urge to hurry, no need for completion. The simple act was all I needed. I looked into her eyes, studying her, watching the emotions flutter across her face. She was getting excited, her breath coming faster, her hips driving back against me. 

I kissed her softly, and was surprised by her passionate response. I picked up the pace, moving faster, taking her, claiming her, Mother Nature our sole witness. 

She whimpered softly, pulling me down and hugging me tightly. I fucked her faster, harder, more desperately. 

"Oh God, oh God, oh GOD!" she moaned loudly, her whole body tensing underneath me. 

Her orgasm excited me to no end, and I sought my own release, moving my hips, searching out just the right friction and angle to enhance the feeling. When I found it, I started a nice motion, long strokes finishing deep inside of her, pulling out to the very edge of her warm treasure. "You're incredible," I told her softly. 

"Jack, Jack," she gasped, arching underneath me, "soooo good," she groaned. 

I was getting close, moving faster, spreading my knees wider, driving with my hips. "Fuck," I groaned. "Incredible." 

She cried out loudly, coming for me again, and the experience pushed me over the edge. I slammed into her, making her scream for me. I came hard, pounding out rope after rope deep inside of her. 

We lay in each other's arms, catching our breath, and reveling in the afterglow. 

I gave her a kiss, and got up, slowly dressing. I enjoyed watching her cover up her body, getting those last few glimpses of her nakedness as she hid it away. I passed her the blanket, and pushed the moss back into place, where my actions had left dents and divots. 

"Whatcha doin'?" she asked. 

"Making the bed," I told her, earning a chuckle. 

We walked back hand-in-hand, quietly. I helped her over logs, and through the brush, while we slowly started chatting again. 

"It's all so unbelievable, surreal," she said, as we saw the edge of the forest at the top of the hill. 

I laughed. "You're getting the bug. It's been eating away at me for 5 years." 

"I can see how. This place is addicting." 

I don't know what came over me, but I didn't want it to end. "If you need a fix over the holidays, the door is always open." 

She hesitated, her hand clutching mine. "You'll be too busy," she whispered. 

"Not for you. Consider it, please." 

"I'll think about it," she said shyly. She turned and gave me another quick kiss, before we broke out into the open. 

The evening was quiet, with a simple steak and baked potato dinner prepared on the outdoor Weber grill by yours truly. We moved out to the porch, and talked long into the night. 

"What are you doing for Christmas, Bev?" I asked. 

"Ham, with a house full of old farts, unless I have a better offer," she giggled. She was sipping on her second glass of wine, and I think she was already smashed. 

"I get off from Christmas through New Year. I'd love the company." 

"I was only teasing. I couldn't stand to interfere with your work," she said. 

"Actually, I could still get a lot done, if you didn't mind. And still take Christmas and New Years off," I assured her. 

"No promises, but I'll give it some thought." Bev answered. "I think I'd better call it a night. It's getting late." 

I got up to give her a kiss goodnight. Karen prepared her for bed, while I closed The House down for the night. 

* * * 

After our afternoon dalliance, I wasn't sure if Karen would be up for some more fun, but she showed up in my room while I was still working at the fireplace. 

We were more playful, exploring each other's bodies, teasing and exciting each other until the urge to go further overwhelmed me. Our lovemaking was different, more urgent, more demanding on my part. We tried a variety of positions, and I prolonged the act as long as I was physically able, taking breaks whenever I got too worked up, alternating between the use of my mouth, my hands, and my needful cock. After seeing how sexy she was climaxing, down by the stream, I was determined to have her come for me again, successfully, a few times. 

I wasn't inexperienced, not by any means, but making love to Karen was different than anything I'd experienced, in a wonderful way. We meshed together perfectly, and when I could hold back no longer, I was completely satisfied, and enjoyed the feeling of my release within her. 

We were both utterly exhausted, and she fell asleep in my arms, with me drifting off soon after. 

During the night, I partially awoke again to that incredible feeling between my legs. I sighed peacefully, accepting her generous gift, moaning softly for her. I allowed her to get me off, remarkably quickly given the circumstances. I gave her my seed, and rolled over to take her in my arms, cuddling close for warmth in the cool room. 

* * * 

I was sorry to see them go, after such a short visit, and told them so. 

"Please say you'll come back soon," I told Bev, with a hug at the airport. "If not at Christmas, then before the spring. I miss you already." 

Bev cackled. "I know what you're missing already. And as much as I'd like to help you with that, I suspect I'd break a hip or worse." She reached up and gave me a kiss. "Thanks for sharing this. It's wonderful. Really." 

I gave Karen a more intimate hug. "Come back soon." 

She smiled, and squeezed me tightly. "I'll do what I can. These last few days have been nothing short of amazing. You're a hell of a man, Jack." 

I kissed her, letting it prolong. "You're quite a woman yourself, Karen. I feel so spoiled and refreshed, and can't wait to get started on the second level." 

"Stay in touch. I left my number on the kitchen table." 

"Too late," I teased. "Already got it from Bev. You'll be hearing from me." 

"Looking forward to it." 

I hated to see them go, but I was aching to get back to work on that old house, to get her in better shape for their return. 

* * * 

That day was spent working on laying out the walls on the second floor, integrating the large vertical posts. I was originally going to lay it out much like the first floor and original design, with a large central hall and stairway, opening into four rooms on each side. I was still astounded by the pure size of the place, wondering how much space a single family needed. I remembered that back in the day, large families were not uncommon and servants might be housed as well. A spur of the moment decision had me changing things, creating only four spacious bedrooms, each essentially a suite. 

With the first and second floors completed, I would have 4 huge bedrooms, each with its own full bath, on the second floor, with a kitchen, living room, dining room, study, bath and pantry on the first. I was thinking of leaving the third floor with a completely open layout, since it was unlikely I'd need to use it at all. 

Which was good. The 3rd floor creeped me out. 

It was drafty, the ceiling was lower, and the fact that the original occupant had leaped to her death from there wasn't helping. Plus, after my couple of close calls while working, I wasn't all that keen on spending any more time there than needed. 

I did want to put in the windows on the second and third floors, but I was going to have to take my time on that until the funds improved. The House had 5 windows in front, two on each side, and three more in back. Twelve windows on the second floor. The third floor had 5 in front but only 1 on each side, and two in back. At over $240 a pop, I had enough money left to complete the second floor windows, but it would leave me nearly broke. I decided to just do the front, for the aesthetics, and one on each side. I'd leave the other five until my cash-flow was better. There was a lot of interior woodwork I could do in the meantime. 

Between the trip to the airport, morning goodbyes, and closing off Bev's bedroom, I didn't get a lot done, but I was still feeling pretty good that I had a plan. 

Dinner was lonely, and I wasn't up to making anything fancy, so I scavenged sandwich fixings out of my depleted food stock, and called it a day early. 

I'd come to enjoy the late night porch drink and smoke, and indulged once more. A single malt and cigar was a nice way to end the day, and I told myself I'd have to put in a stock of both. 

I felt a little better after receiving the call from Bev. They'd made it back in one piece. 

"I had to call," Bev explained. "I know I said I wouldn't, but I had to tell you. The last few days with you were the best I've spent in decades. Thank you, Jack." 

"Bev, I feel exactly the same. I love this place, love working on it. For the first time ever, there's something wrong. It feels empty. I miss you already." 

She giggled. I loved that giggle. It seemed to strip away the years. "I know what you're missing, young man." 

"Tease all you want, crazy woman. You know the truth as well as I do. I miss my partner, my friend, my adopted Mom." 

"I miss you too, Sweetie," she said softly. "I can't thank you enough." 

"You're coming for Christmas, right?" 

"I told you I'd think about it." 

"You had half a day. Don't make me go down there and kidnap you." 

"Fine. You're mean, to twist an old woman's arm like this. Can I bring Karen again?" 

"You better. Unless you're planning on doing all the cooking." 

"Right. I'm sure that's the reason." 

"You're a terrible tease, aren't you Mom?" 

"You're just figuring that out? It's not like I have much else to do these days. You wanna talk to her? She's standing right here, trying to act all cool and collected. Think I should make her wait any longer?" 

"Let's make her sweat," I teased. "You know I'd rather talk to you than anyone else." 

"Who's teasing now? Love you, Jack. I'm putting her on." 

"Love you too," I said quickly. 

"Love me? You barely know me! This is so sudden," Karen said softly. 

Shit. Oh shit. "Uhh," I started. 

"I'm kidding, Jack. Don't have a cow. I'll let her know what you said. Ol' cranky puss is in rare form. Flying makes her grouchy." 

"You keep saying that. I don't see it." 

"You're a guy. She's sweet on the guys. One guy in particular it seems. Can't say I blame her." 

"I miss you already. You're coming back for Christmas with her, right?" 

"Is that what she meant by twisting her arm? You talked her into it?" She sounded pleased. 

"Seems so. You wouldn't be mean enough to send her alone, would you?" 

Karen laughed. "If you're inviting, I'm there. I'm no fool." She stopped her giggling. "I miss you too. God, it's like I've known you for years, not a few days." 

We chatted for a few more minutes before she begged off. "I really do need to take care of Bev. These long trips are hard on her. Thanks for calling. Think of me." 

"Non-stop, I expect. Take good care of her." 

"Of course. I owe her big time." 

Going to bed I reviewed my plans for the upcoming week. Unfortunately my job still beckoned, but I should still get in plenty of work time each evening, four to five hours at least. 

My bed was lonely. I missed Karen. I found myself stroking an erection, almost laughing. I didn't masturbate more than a couple of times a week, often less, but the recent spate of sexual escapades had me hard as a rock, without my new playmate to take care of things. 

The room was warm from the heat of the fireplace. I pulled the covers aside, and closed my eyes, remembering. I could almost feel her stroking me, sliding her warm mouth over my cock. The feeling was incredible, tingling, setting my nerves on fire. 

I looked down at my hardness, standing tall, basking in the feeling running up and down my shaft. I grabbed the second pillow, putting it behind my head, propping myself up. I was getting close, so close. 

With a gasp I bolted upright. I was being stroked, but it wasn't me. 

It wasn't anybody. I was alone in bed, but I had felt it, a smooth soft movement up and down my length. I looked around, doubting my own senses. 

Then it started again. A tingling feeling, that set the hair on my legs to standing on end. A soft movement, up and down my rod. It wasn't a stray breeze, or some other oddity. It was clearly a stroking. I gazed down between my legs. I didn't see anything at first, then I noticed the skin on my shaft was shifting up and down with the movement. 

Was I crazy? Was I dreaming? What the hell was going on! 

The feeling was intense, and I felt a new pressure on the head, enclosing it. Without warning, I felt the urge to come burst upon me, and I groaned as I exploded. It was powerful, and my hips bucked against the invisible force, spasm after spasm of pleasure emptying me. Yet when it was over, I looked down at my wilting cock to see it was dry and clean. No evidence of what had just happened. 

I didn't believe in ghosts, or spirits, or succubi, or any other supernatural visitor, but my brain was short-circuiting, and I had no explanation for what had just happened. 

Suddenly I was clammy, cold. I pulled the covers up and huddled underneath them. 

It took me forever to get to sleep. 

* * * 

I was useless at work the next day, my mind still in a fog. It must have been my imagination, or a very real dream. I managed to answer a few calls, and avoid any serious snafus. I was glad when the end of the work day rolled around. 

I delayed going home, stopping by the hardware store and ordering the windows, then hitting the grocery store to restock. I even splurged at the local Wendy's. By the time I finally got to The House, I had convinced myself that it had been my imagination. 

An imagination that was running amok. 

I found myself imagining things, touches to my hair, something brushing against my hip. I was normally pretty quiet when on my own, but I was talking to The House, asking if anybody was there. What did they want? What was going on? 

At least moving some wood and tools up to the second floor distracted me for a while, and I worked later than I would normally during the week. I still opted for a scotch on the porch, nervous about going to bed. I made it a double.  

===

When I finally retired to my room, it was well after midnight. I put on a pair of boxers, and climbed under the covers. I kept my hand clear of my waist, in case playing with myself had been a catalyst to whatever the hell happened. I felt foolish, more convinced than ever that my mind was playing tricks on me. 

I fell asleep easier than I would have thought possible. 

It was cool in the room. I was slowly waking to that same wondrous feeling. My covers had been pushed aside, and my cock was sticking up out of the fly in my boxers, hard and happy. I almost leaped out of the bed, when I recognized the stroking from the night before. I reached my hand down to see if I could feel anything, but there was nothing to feel. Moving my hand up and down, I sensed that same tingling, almost like static electricity, and the hair on my arms stood up. When I pulled my hand away, the tingling went away, but the feeling surrounding my cock lingered, and if anything intensified. 

What the fuck? 

What was happening to me? Inwardly, I knew I should be concerned, but I felt nothing but pleasure. I wasn't scared. I wasn't even nervous. I was being pleasured, being tended with gentleness. I moaned. The intensity was as strong as the previous night, stirring me strongly. 

"You're going to make me come," I said softly. 

I felt that enveloping closure around my cock. Not warm precisely, but blocking the coolness of the room. The crown of my head was being teased, my shaft stroked. I felt the end approaching and watched. I came hard, grunting, and saw my cum disappearing. Rope after rope I expelled, only to watch it immediately fade away. 

The stroking continued for a brief moment longer, and then to my amazement, my cock was tucked back into my boxers. 

"Why?" I asked the empty room. 

I didn't really expect an answer and I didn't get one. 

* * * 

Once it started, it only got worse. 

I was marginally more useful at work, and was able to complete a customer visit without fucking up too badly. I was making slow progress on The House, sometimes speaking to Bev and/or Karen on my phone while working. I didn't mention my late night visitor of course. I didn't believe it, how could they? 

I went back to sleeping naked, and found that if I made myself available when I got in the bed, my spectral friend would go to work right away. The feelings were intensifying, the stroking more pronounced. I imagined it was a mouth finishing me, and felt the reaction more intensely. I could feel suction. The tingling was as strong as ever, but the motion had a more physical element. 

Each time I came, I was still surprised to find myself clean and dry afterward. The release was exhausting, leaving me cold and trembling, yet frighteningly satisfied. 

My visitor was becoming greedier, and I was waking most nights to another erection being tended to. I experimented with staying in bed in the morning, stroking myself, and quickly found my helper was willing to take over for me. A steaming hot shower afterward took care of any lingering aftereffects. 

By the time the weekend arrived, I considered myself lucky. All the stories I'd heard about ghosts or spirits had never hinted at this. No eerie noises, no furniture clattering, no strange footsteps. Just a willing sex buddy, with the singular goal of getting me off. Was that really so bad? 

I took a break midday on Sunday, after lunch and a call to my girls out west. I cleaned up, stripped down and climbed in my bed naked, waiting to see if anything would happen. It took a couple of minutes and I wasn't disappointed. 

It was different. I felt the touch, but this time it was on my chest, fondling me, stroking me. The tingling was minimized, replaced with the feather-light contact. The caressing slowly moved southward, bypassing my limp cock, and focusing on my legs. I looked at the bed to see if I could detect any movement, but it was all limited to my body. 

My cock wasn't left alone long, and I felt the motion on it, the slight pressure caressing, then surrounding me. I quickly hardened, imagining invisible hands stroking me to readiness. 

I relaxed, giving myself over to the feeling, letting my spectral guest work. I could feel the motion clearly, imagining where the fingers enveloped me, the lone thumb opposite. The mouth settled down early, encasing me, moving further down my shaft. 

"That's nice," I murmured, being rewarded with a teasing of the head. 

As was usual, I came rather quickly, but my ghostly fellatrix continued to stroke me, playing with me, teasing me, rapidly restoring my hardness. It took longer the second time, but I was able to deliver a second gift after a few minutes. 

I felt the movement again, moving up my body, brushing across my nipples. A gentle tingling pressure against my lips almost made me jump, but I held still, feeling the pressure return, a soft hint against my parted lips, but undeniable. 

I closed my eyes, wondering what the hell was going on. 

"Who are you?" I asked softly. 

It might have been my imagination, but I thought I heard the faintest of whispers. 

"...friend..." 

* * * 

It had only been three weeks since Bev and Karen had left, and three more weeks until they'd be coming back out for Christmas. I was hard at work, determined to impress them with the updated second floor. 

Things were moving ahead great. I was completely energized, my real-world job doing well, and The House effort was paying off. My first several months of working on The House on my own had been difficult emotionally. I was alone, except for the remote Bev, who at the time had been a wonderful anchor, but seemed more like an audience than a participant. 

The long weekend together had changed all that. I saw her as a partner now, so much of her life vested in my project. Karen was in, too. Whereas Bev focused on every detail of The House, Karen was fascinated with the place as a whole, especially the property, the landscaping, the stream and our fabulous forest. Each day I continued to send them pictures of my work, holding back a few surprises for their visit. 

The time since then had introduced a new partner into my plans. 

My bedtime visitor was making her presence more known. I thought of my uninvited guest as a 'her', I guess my macho self couldn't imagine anyone satisfying me sexually as anything else. 

The touches were becoming common events, brushing against me whenever I took a break. Only inside The House, although the porch was included. It was crazy, I know. No other word for it. I loved her touch, and started seeking it out. After a day's work, I'd come home tired. I'd change, prepare myself dinner, and unwind on the porch, calling my girls nearly every evening. About a week earlier, I'd felt her touch on my cheek, my neck, while on the phone. I don't know what made me do it, but I stood and lowered my pants and boxers. I was speaking with Karen, having finished my call with Bev, and the sensation started. I was hard within moments, but the touch was different, teasing. It was only after I got off the phone that the real action started. 

I leaned back, sipping a beer, and let her pleasure me. The warmth was there, the sliding pressure, the gentle movement. I lasted a couple of minutes, completed another orgasm that left me dry, got dressed and proceeded to work on the upstairs. 

My new daily routine had me putting on a robe for dinner, getting my spectral blowjob, working a few hours on The House, getting another one after my evening shower, waking to another in the middle of the night, and starting the day right with yet another. I didn't understand it. There was something about her touch that brought me to near instant readiness. It seemed no matter how often I came, she could always get me ready for more. 

I was talking to her now. Not getting any response other than the usual touch or caress. I'd finished framing all the rooms upstairs, installed the wiring, and was starting to put up the walls. I expected that by the end of the weekend, I'd have two of the rooms finished on the inside. I was leaving the plumbing and hallway walls open until I got my electrician to sign off on the wiring. Most of each paycheck went for more things for The House. Other than gas and food, I had few expenses. 

I was pleasantly exhausted, relaxed, the fire keeping the room toasty, the covers pulled aside. It was late, after 1:00 am, and my friend was in a hurry. I was barely in the bed, before I felt her touch. 

I chuckled, getting comfortable. "We can go twice in a row, if you like," I said. 

She worked me through the first one pretty quickly. I groaned my release, and was surprised to feel her touch moving up my body. Looking down I could see the sparse hairs on my chest moving as the caress continued upward. It advanced to my neck, and across my cheeks, until it seemed my face was being held. I moaned as a faint pressure descended on my lips, a gentle touch opening them. An incredibly sweet invisible kiss. 

My erection had returned, and I groaned as I felt another touch, down there. A renewed pressure, enveloping me, invisible lips still grazing mine. It started moving, and my hips responded automatically. 

"God that feels good, Mary," I groaned. 

As quickly as that, all the sensation disappeared. I was left with an aching hard-on, and a fear that my words had frightened my friend off. I was stunned for a moment, the haze that enveloped me during my visitations slower to disappear than her touch. 

I had never given the visitor a name, not in my head, and certainly not out loud. I don't know why I said that, or picked that name. I guess that's not completely true, moments after I was alone, I suspected the reason. Bev's Aunt Mary was the one who had met her untimely demise in The House. I didn't know any other Mary, and once I thought about it, I realized I associated her with The House stronger than anything else. 

After the way I'd scared her off I guess I was wrong. Hell, the original house had been built at least 140 years before she ever graced it with her presence. Who knows how many dozens of people lived in it over the years? Or if that even had anything to do with what was going on. 

I didn't get woken up in the night. After waiting almost half an hour in the morning, I didn't receive my morning gift. I felt bad, mildly depressed, while I worked on one of my side projects the whole morning. No touches during the day, no mystery caresses. I was alone in The House. 

A brief call to Bev raised my spirits a bit after lunch, and I went back upstairs to work on the bedrooms. The walls were finished with the same wood I was using for everything. Drywall would have been easier, but nothing was cheaper than free wood, and I certainly had enough of that. I used it for the flooring, for the walls, even for the ceilings. I loved the feel of it, the smell, and knowing it came from the property. Mostly hickory for framing, white oak for paneling, and red oak for the flooring. I couldn't bring myself to cut down any of the most spectacular specimens, but clearing the road to The House gave me plenty to work with, including a good bit of pine nearest the road. The diversity of the trees still amazed me. 

After dinner, it was back to side projects before calling it a night. I waited, hopefully for a late night visit, but was disappointed. 

By Sunday night, I was starting to think it had all been my imagination. A ghostly friend with benefits? Right. I'd made great progress on the second floor, and was feeling good about things again. I made an early night of it, calling the girls, sipping my scotch on the porch, and settling in with a cigar. 

I showered the sweat off, and gave it another 30 minutes or so, exposing myself, hoping for a visit. No luck, however, and I settled in for a restless night. 

When I woke, it was still pitch dark out, and my covers were gone. I was hard and being serviced. "Sorry," I said softly. "I didn't mean to offend." 

The action continued, more demanding, and after a couple of minutes of attention, I moaned my release. I was happy for the moment, and settled back in. I pulled the covers up, and almost laughed when they slowly slid off my body again. The touching started, caressing my chest, then shoulders. I felt movement on my hardening cock, and once again, the feeling of complete envelopment. 

"Thank you, that's incredible," I whispered softly, as my mysterious visitor slid up and down my length. 

I closed my eyes, and felt her brush against my lips. I kissed her back, thrusting upward needily. Something moved between my lips and I opened my mouth. I opened my eyes, and found myself staring into a mirage, a barely visible pair of dark eyes gazing back at me. 

My heart raced and I had to resist screaming. The eyes moved away, and I could make out the barest outline of a feminine face, almost a shimmer in the air, the surrounding room clear behind it. The motion was still going on at my waist, and even the fear couldn't stop me from responding. I was getting close, too close, when the movement stopped. The phantasmal face moved downward and captured my cock, only moments before I erupted. 

The feeling was stronger than ever before, and I gasped, shooting off over and over again, until I was totally spent. I lay there sweating, my chest heaving, fighting off a case of the shakes. Looking down, I saw the face was gone. That's all it ever was, no body, not even hair, just a hint of a face. A beautiful one. 

Trembling, I reached for the covers, only to stop when they slowly crawled up my body, covering me up. My lips were brushed against momentarily, and I was left wondering for my sanity. 

* * * 

The following week passed, and I was back into my regular daily schedule. No more faces, but I was serviced three or four times a day. I still spoke to her softly, only of my pleasure. No names, no questions. I didn't want to scare her away. 

On Tuesday I was given the flight arrival times for Bev and Karen. They'd be arriving a week from Thursday on December 23rd, in the evening. I had Friday off for Christmas, so that worked out perfectly. The following week was our Christmas shutdown, from the 27th, through New Years. I'd have plenty of time to spend with the girls. 

Jim, my electrician inspected my electrical work, and after insisting on a few changes, signed off on it, for a couple of hundred bucks. I called Andrew, took Friday afternoon off, and had him out. He looked over the work, signed off his paper, and gave me the nice green tag I needed to keep going, at least legally. I took the opportunity to invite him and his family out over the Christmas holiday. I think I surprised him. 

"Maybe Sunday the 26th?" I offered. 

He grinned. "I need to check in at home, but I know Brianna would love to see the place, after all I've told her. You don't mind the kids?" 

"Heck no. One day I wouldn't mind filling the place with my own. Try to talk her into it. I'll have some guests over, the original owner and her nurse." 

He smirked. "I know you're not going to tell me you're living in there." 

"Of course not! My trailer may be a little crowded, but it's still here." 

He grinned. "Alright Jack. No more questions from me. But if you could get the third floor wired and the plumbing finished, as well as put in the last windows, I imagine we can find a way to get you a habitation permit. Please don't drag it out too long." 

"Believe me, if I had the funds, I'd do it tomorrow. It'll be a few more months probably, but I'll see what I can do." 

"If you want, I can talk to Dale at the bank. I'm sure he could work out a short-term loan for you. It's not like you don't have a couple of million dollars of collateral here." 

A couple of million? "I doubt it's worth anywhere near that." 

"Are you kidding? Nearly 500 acres, worth at least $4 grand an acre? Hell, the guys at the University are hammering on me to get everything from the creek north declared a national treasure. Dr. Jansen is convinced you have a State Champion beech on your property. Your lumber alone is probably worth three times what the land is, although it would be a real shame to cut any of the old growth down." 

I was stunned by his numbers, and realized I had no idea what I was sitting on. "I think I'm in way over my head. I'm gonna need some help. Shit, I hadn't even thought about what the property taxes were going to run me." 

"That shouldn't be too bad. I'm guessing that 490+ acres of the land will come under agricultural timber management. It'll cost you a few thousand a year, tops. The property taxes on the house will cost you more than that. I wouldn't sweat it yet. As long as you don't do anything with the land other than right around this house, you should be safe. I'll ask around." 

Once he'd left, I knew I needed to take some time and do some real research and planning. I was feeling more than a little stressed. 

Saturday, the daily caresses continued, and it seemed like things were back to normal with my special friend. I received my morning wake up call, a surprise lunchtime relief, and another visit during my porch unwinding time. I had completed a couple of my surprise projects, and was particularly relaxed. 

I was talking to her again, describing what I wanted to do with The House, asking her opinion on decisions, not expecting any reply. It was similar to what I was doing with Bev. I'd hate to think how weird it would have looked if anyone saw me. 

At dinner, I even set her a place at the table. I wasn't so far gone that I served her food, but for some reason I thought she might join me. 

"Bev and Karen are coming for Christmas next week. I hope you don't mind." 

Of course there was no response. 

"I really need to figure out a worthy present for Bev. You know she's the one who sold me this place. Gave it to me really. I couldn't have done any of this without her." 

After a suitably long pause, I continued. "Andrew's probably bringing his family by for dinner next Sunday. It'll be nice to have a full house. I don't know what it was like in your day, but now there's a million ways the government messes with you. We're lucky to have him on our side. He could have made this hell on us, but he's been a Godsend." 

I continued my one-sided conversation throughout dinner and the cleanup. I was feeling good about the inspection and my progress. I knew I'd be able to finish the four bedroom walls the next day. I only put in a couple of hours after dinner and decided to call it a day. 

"Join me on the porch? I think I'll have a night cap and we can hit the bed early. We both deserve to celebrate a bit. This was a big day." 

I didn't dress down for my break. I had my drink and a smoke, and chatted. I knew she was with me. I could sense it. 

"I wish I knew something about you. What I should call you. I think we'll be together for a long time. I know I'm not going anywhere, this is my dream house." 

I told her of my obsession with the place, hunting down information on it, tracking down Bev. I rehashed my first meetings at the senior home, and her generous gift. I even told her about what I knew of the history. 

I was out there a good hour, in the cool night air. I was getting cold, and figured I'd had enough. "Come to bed, beautiful? Celebrate with me?" 

I was only a little surprised when I felt her wispy kiss. 

I took a quick shower. I wanted to be clean for her. Why? I have no idea. It was important to me. I dried off, brushed my teeth, combed my hair, and retired to my bedroom. I built up the fire to keep the chill out, pulled down the sheets, and climbed on the bed. 

I felt her touch within moments, making me hard. "Can we take it slow? I'm here for you. As many times as you want, tonight. Whatever you need." 

I guess she took me at my word. She teased me, her always faint touch just a whisper against my flesh. Her kiss, on the other hand, was firmer and warmer than ever. I had a flash of her face, it materialized for only a few seconds. Her hair was long and dark, piercing eyes that drilled down to my very soul, lips that offered a hint of a smile.  

===

"You are beautiful," I whispered softly. "So young and beautiful, it makes my heart ache." 

Her appearance faded after a few more seconds, but I knew where her face had gone, as my shaft was taken into her mouth. "I love how you do that," I told her. 

She took her time, teasing, getting me close twice before finishing me. That was something new. New and delicious. I felt her touch, exploring my body, then some more of her delightful kisses. 

"I mean it. As much as you want tonight. Three, even four times, if you'd like." 

I had no idea what I'd invited. The second blow job was a quick one, following only a few minutes after my invitation. Unbelievably, her touch had me hard again. I sensed her movement. "Ride me beautiful." 

It was agonizingly sweet. Her slow, gentle movement, her soft caresses, the occasional kiss. I saw something new, I hadn't noticed before. There would be a pause, and the angle of my cock against my body would change. She was changing position. 

"Enjoying yourself, wild thing?" I teased. 

The motion sped up, and I moaned as the pleasurable feelings reached a new plateau. "You are simply incredible," I confessed. "That feels amazing." 

My cock was pointed forward, and I knew she was hovering over me, rocking back and forth on my cock. My hips were working with her. I could swear I felt her breath on my face. Her face appeared for a moment. She was smiling, and damn if she didn't wink at me, before disappearing again. 

"So...damn...good," I moaned. "I hope...you're...enjoying this." 

Her lips claimed mine, almost real in their firmness. The movement changed, an odd feeling, moving around my cock. I realized she was grinding against me. The lips were gone. I had a short glimpse of her face, coming into focus for only a second, forehead crinkled in concentration, eyes squeezed shut. 

"...coming..." 

It was shocking. Mind blowing. I gasped my own pleasure. "Gonna..." 

Abruptly, my cock was uncovered, and I shot my load into the air, far more than I had any right to for a third time. Moments after I started coming, the head was covered again, and the remainder disappeared into nothingness. The action continued, and when it stopped, my cock was clean once more. 

I chuckled. "You finally speak to me, and that's what you've got to say? Coming?" 

She moved up my body, touching, caressing, toying with me. 

If I expected a break, I was sorely mistaken. Her touch became frenzied, all over the place, tagging and moving, surprising me. Her lips met mine, and moments later something was pressing my lips. I tested it with my tongue, and felt a firm nipple which I sucked on for the few moments it was present. 

I was ready again, and accepted that there was something impossible about her touch. Instant full hardness, and I was being ridden again. It didn't seem natural, hell, it wasn't natural. My heart was beating like a hammer, my skin clammy and chilled. I felt cold, everywhere except my burning hot shaft, driving into my spectral girlfriend. "Fuck me," I groaned. 

Her presence became more solid after each new time. I could feel weight on my hips for the first time, hands resting on my chest. It was still a soft, almost feathery touch, but it was there. Physical contact. Real. 

My focus was narrowing, vision tunneling, my pulse beating loudly in my head. I reached down to touch her, my hands meeting no resistance. The hair on my arms stood on end, goose bumps rising. 

She was merciless. The warm tunnel encasing my shaft was moving impossibly fast, pulsing around me, tingling, driving me crazy. I groaned, legs shaking, muscles tensing. I needed to come for her. I had to. Desperately. 

I felt the end approaching, her movement stretching out, longer strokes, demanding. Something was probing my mouth, but what it was, I had no idea. Those dark eyes appeared above me, my narrowing vision incapable of seeing anything beyond their burning need, gazing into mine. I was paralyzed, helpless, muscles cramping. The sounds escaping my throat were indecipherable, even to me. 

I cried out, thrusting madly, as my cock settled deeply inside her, tracking her movements, inescapable. My seed jettisoned powerfully, continuously, pumping incessantly, until I lost my grip with reality and consciousness. 

* * * 

I was cold, trembling, clutching my covers. Someone was stroking my hair. I cracked my eyelids, and saw those dark orbs staring back into mine. The last I'd seen of them, they'd been on fire, intense. Now they appeared soft, concerned. 

"...sorry..." 

I reached out to her, and watched in amazement as her head took shape, no longer transparent, now translucent, as solid as I'd ever seen her. Her lips were full, corners turned down in concern. Her long hair shimmered, hanging naturally. My hand met resistance as it touched her cheek, and her own cupped mine, holding it against her face. 

"You're b-b-beautiful," I managed to croak, through chattering teeth. 

Her lips parted, a smile painting her face. Her hand appeared before me, her slender fingers caressing my face. Her fingertips touched my eyelids, and I closed them, drifting off again. 

* * * 

I ached. The sheets were wet, sticking to my skin. I pushed the covers away, struggling to sit up. I lowered my legs over the side of the bed, stretching, clearing my head. I looked around, getting my bearings. I was alone. 

As if reading my mind, I felt her touch, sliding down my bare back. "Hi," I said softly. 

Two hands, brushing across my shoulders. 

"That was... different. I think we'll call two the limit in the future." I tried to sound casual, and not reflect the fear of her I felt for the first time. Instinctively, I knew there was no malice. She understood no more than I, the risk in completely submitting to her. 

The touch lingered on my skin as I stood. I stumbled to the shower, and stood under the hot water, lathering up thoroughly, until I felt clean once more. I was surprised that I didn't feel sore between my legs. Overall I felt better, just worn out. When I was done bathing, I put on my robe, and hit the kitchen. 

I set the table for both of us, and made myself a couple of sandwiches. It was past 1:00 in the afternoon, and I felt listless, drained. Lying in bed, I'd spent my conscious moments trying to understand what was happening to me. I took a pad of paper and wrote notes placing them on the table in front of her seat. From right to left, they read "Don't Know", "Yes", "No", and "Maybe". I looked for something lightweight, and placed a plastic bottle-cap in front of the notes, centered between the 'Yes' and 'No'. 

I sat with my sandwich and chips, took a big bite, and waited a moment to make sure my friend joined me. "You have a hard time speaking, don't you?" 

The bottle-cap trembled, and moved in front of the 'Yes'. My heart leaped. 

"Did you know it would be like that, last night?" 

The piece of plastic shifted over a couple of inches in front of the 'No'. 

I took a couple of bites, wondering how far I wanted to push it. "Does it bother you, for me to ask these questions?" 

The bottle-cap moved onto the 'No', on top of the note, and bounced up and down a couple of times. Pretty emphatic. 

"You want to communicate with me?" 

The cap rose up and settled directly on the 'Yes'. 

"Good," I said, working on my sandwich. I took a drink of my soda, washing it down. "You're getting stronger, clearer. You need what we're doing, don't you?" 

The bottle-cap rose up and settled back down on the 'Yes'. 

"Is there anything else I can do, to help?" 

The cap shifted, then slowly moved to the end 'Don't Know'. 

"Is this difficult for you? Tiring? What we're doing now?" 

The cap shifted downward, moving raggedly before settling over the 'Maybe'. 

That seemed like an odd response. Not difficult? Something else? I thought about it, trying to make sense. I spoke my thoughts aloud. "Not really difficult or tiring, something else? I can see you're getting stronger, more substantial. You're speaking, showing me yourself. Your touch is firmer. You don't seem to mind touching me, that's more frequent." 

I wasn't paying too much attention, my thoughts rambling. I saw the cap was shifting, and after my last words it shifted in front of the 'Yes'. 

"Making yourself seen, speaking, that's more difficult," I said. 

The cap shifted over to the 'No', then slid to the 'Maybe' and back to the 'No'. 

"No? Not more difficult? But you do it much less. There must be a reason. Half a dozen words, you seemed willing enough to show yourself while we were doing it. If not difficult, why not? It is... what... costly?" 

The cap jumped over to the yes. 

"Costly... draining?" 

Yes. Yes. Yes. 

I think I understood. "What we do, you need it to get stronger. Becoming visible, talking, things like that, it drains you." 

YES. The cap came down strongly. 

"I see. The touching, the small movements, they don't cost you much, do they. The other stuff does." 

YES. 

"So what we need to do is save your energy, while building you up. Is that right?" 

The cap didn't move, but moments later, I felt her lips on mine. It was always a little surprising. The kiss lingered, firmer, warmer. 

"I'm going to take that as a 'Yes'." 

The lips tickled my ear, and a soft breath seemed to caress me. 

"...please..." 

"Shhh. Save your strength. No talking, just kiss me." 

She did, and I think we had an understanding. I thought about what was happening, how easily I accepted the insanity. While I ate, I saw the papers shift. The 'Yes' moved to my right, the 'No' to my left. I was a little confused. I felt a firm tug on my right earlobe, and the bottle-cap was placed on the 'Yes'. A few seconds later, there was another tug, this time on my left ear. The cap settled over the 'No'. She wasn't very subtle. 

I chuckled, and tugged my own right ear. "I get it. 'Yes' on the right, 'No' on the left." 

That earned me a tug on the right ear, and another feathery kiss. 

I cleaned up after myself, and headed to the bedroom to dress. I laid out my clothing and removed my robe. I had wanted to do a lot today, and I'd already blown the entire morning. I felt her touch, gentle, tentative. 

My thoughts returned to how she'd drained me, worn me out the night before. I don't believe she meant to do it. For some reason, as foolish as it may seem, I felt no animosity, no fear. If anything, after seeing her that morning, I sensed remorse. It was an accident. We just had to be more careful. 

I shifted the clothing over, and lay in the middle of the unmade bed. "Let's fill you up, beautiful." 

The lips on mine were soft, gentle, but consistent. Her tongue was between my lips, moving slowly, brushing against mine. Then they moved down my body, and I was hardening in her mouth. She was gentle, taking her time, letting me last a few minutes before I came for her. 

Her lips returned to mine, briefly. 

"Enough for now?" 

I felt the tug on my right ear. Yes. 

"Good. We'll do it more, but spread it out, Ok?" 

'Yes.' 

"Alright. I have a ton to do if we're going to get this house straightened out. Time for work." 

I got a quick little kiss, and some teasing touches while I got dressed. I think we understood each other. 

* * * 

Things had changed. No doubt about it. I was energized again, working hard on The House. Every few hours I'd take a break, and if I opened my pants, I soon was on the receiving side of another invisible blowjob. I got lots of little touches, and occasional responses to my talking, little tugs on my ears, soft caresses. No images, no speech, just the pleasure, and light touches. 

My evening calls were still happening. I wasn't disclosing everything I was working on, but kept Bev and Karen updated. I was eager to see them, but a little nervous about whether my ghostly girl was going to make herself known to my guests. I didn't know how to approach discussing it. 

Evenings we spent together, and while we were engaged in our trysts, she'd show herself to me on occasion, sometimes teasingly. Her breast would appear in front of my face, moments before her nipple would ease down to my lips. Her eyes, her face, commonly showed up in front of mine, just a quick glimpse to let me see her, see what she was feeling, how she was responding. 

I know it was physically impossible, but I was coming for her five, six even seven times a day, often twice before sleep. Workdays, it was usually five or six times. And still, every time she touched me, I was ready for her again. 

Wednesday, I needed to take a break. "I have to do some Christmas shopping. Do a little decorating. I guess I'm going to have to settle for what I've completed so far. Any ideas?" 

I don't know why I asked. It wasn't like she would answer. Especially not during my welcome home blowjob. I delivered her reward, and headed into town. I didn't have a lot of money to spare, but I wanted to find something nice. 

Main Street had several boutique type stores, but I was having a hard time finding anything I liked. I had found a couple of little things but I wanted something better, more meaningful. I turned onto a side street, with several antiques set out on the sidewalk. 

I stepped into the cluttered shop, a variety of 'antiques' on display. In some ways, it seemed almost like a yard sale. Lots of the things seemed like junk, and yet scattered among them were obvious treasures. An older, gray-haired, largish woman was observing me. 

"Anything special I can help you with?" she asked. 

"Just browsing," I said, not wanting to be bothered or pushed. I looked up at her, and froze. On the wall behind her were numerous old pictures, and just over her shoulder was my house. 

She caught my glance. "An old picture perhaps? They're all local, mostly photos from the 20's and 30's." 

I moved closer, leaning over the counter. "The House?" 

She turned and looked at it. "One of our most famous. Over 200 years old, you know. South of here, a few miles. Beautiful, wasn't it?" 

"How much?" 

She smiled, and pulled it off the wall, looking on the back. "It's an original, not a print. Most of the others are more reasonable." 

"No, that one." 

"I could let you have it for $250." 

$250! For a picture? For that I could put in another window, and it got me no closer to the gifts I needed to buy. Still, how could I pass it up? 

She saw my hesitation, and pulled down a different picture. "Main Street. 1907. All but two buildings are gone now, $20, $36 with the frame." 

I ignored the picture, studying the others on the wall. 

She tilted up the original picture. "You really like this one, don't you? Tell you what? It's Christmas, let's make it $220, and I'll wrap it." 

I pulled the picture closer, studying it. I was stunned. The porch I'd built was almost a mirror image of the one in the photo. I examined the landscaping, trying to determine what the plants were, how I could replicate the layout. 

She breathed deeply, almost a gasp. "You're him, aren't you?" 

"Him?" 

"The guy rebuilding the house. You're him." 

"Guilty." 

"Why now?" she asked. 

"I just got possession 8 months ago. I've wanted to fix it up for 5 years." I looked up at her, and her smile had changed. More genuine, less 'salesy'. 

"I understand. My husband and I got bit bad by one of those old places. It's an addiction." 

"Obsession." 

She nodded. "How's it going? Making good progress?" 

"The exterior and first floor are almost complete. I was hoping to have it completed by spring, but it's more expensive than I ever could have imagined. I've nearly run out of money, so I'll be taking it slower in the near future. I guess I'll still be able to do some of the interior finish work, but I was really counting on getting all the windows in this year." 

She had a cute laugh, which set her whole body bouncing. "Tell me about it, every penny I make seems to get poured back into the bottomless pit we live in. Thank God my husband earns a good living." She paused a moment, while I studied the picture more carefully. "Let me check my books. I think I have some things you'll want to see." 

She disappeared in back. I thought it was rather trusting of her, leaving the place empty. It was a long time before I heard from her. At least 20 minutes, and I was getting antsy as my time for shopping ticked away. I was checking out the other pictures, but kept returning to my house. 

"Lock the front door, Honey? And come on back." 

I followed her directions, and walked through the back door. If I thought the front was cluttered, the large back room looked like a hoarder's wet dream. 

She was tugging something off a shelf, and it looked like she was stuck. I helped her, moving a broken desktop out of the way, while she pulled a large ornately framed mirror free. She carried it to the corner, among a dozen more items. An eclectic collection. Then a framed picture caught my attention. The frame was cracked, one corner broken off. The glass was clouded. None of that mattered. 

It was her. My girl. 

"These are all supposed to have come from your house. Part of an estate sale I picked up about 20 years ago. Little of it has much valuable, mostly common stuff, and not in the greatest shape. I understand it was scavenged from the house after the fire." 

"How much?" 

"For the picture?" 

"For all of it. How much for all of it." 

She was slow to respond. "The picture up front as well?" 

"Please." I gazed at the young woman in the photo. She was seated on my porch, an ivory and lace full length dress carefully spread around her ankles. Her hair was up. Even in faded sepia tones she was absolutely stunning. 

"You know the story?" 

I nodded. "I bought the property from the original owner's niece. She filled me in." 

"Sad. Lovely girl to die so young. They had a baby." She shuffled through the stuff, and pulled out a silver frame. A picture of the family showed the wife seated, husband standing over her shoulder, a beautiful infant in her arms. A handsome family. They looked happy. I'm certain they were. 

"$250," she said softly. 

"And for the rest of it?" 

"For all of it. You should have it. It belongs in that house. I'll almost break even. I would only ask that you invite me up to see it all sometime when you're finished." 

It wasn't fair to her. I have no idea what antiques are worth, but it had to be more than that. "Let me pay you $500. I know it's not enough, but it's all I have." 

She shook her head. "Save your money for the restoration. I'm sure you'll need it. I'd feel guilty if I slowed you down." 

I looked up at her, stunned by her generosity. "Sunday? I'm having a few people up Sunday. The House is not nearly done yet, but I've made a lot of progress. Could you and your husband make it?" 

She was slow to respond. "My daughter's family is coming up for Christmas." 

"Invite them. Please. I'd love to have you come. You have no idea what this means to me." 

She grinned. "I think I do. Look at my business. Everything tells me a story. If you can help turn that tragic old building into something wonderful again, it would be a miracle. I understand." 

No you don't, I thought. "Can you make it?" 

"I'll try. I'd love to, I just have to convince the rest of them. Any special time?" 

"Anytime after 2:00. I'm serving an early dinner." 

"I don't know how long I'll be able to stay, but we'll be there. Thank you." 

"No, thank you. This is perfect. I can't believe how fortunate I am to have found your place." 

"Surely you don't think it's a coincidence, do you?" she asked enigmatically. "Some things are meant to happen. I'm certain this is one." She closed her book. "There are a few more things around her somewhere. When I have a chance I'll see if I can hunt them down." 

I paid her, thanking her profusely. I loaded up my truck, still unable to believe my luck. I was never much of a believer in fate, but that was changing. I mean, seriously? What were the odds?  

===

* * * 

I walked in the front door, empty handed. "Mary? I need you to do me a favor." 

It was only the second time I'd called her by her name. The first time she'd disappeared for two days. I hoped our new connection would prevent that. 

The feathery touch against my cheek, and the soft kiss reassured me. 

"I've got a surprise. I'd like you to hide until I call you. No peeking, alright?" 

The gentle tug on my right ear was her reply. 

Ten minutes later I had all her things in the living room. The picture of The House was centered over the fireplace. Her photo was on the wall beside the door, where I could see it every time I left. The family picture was centered on the coffee table. 

"You can come out now," I called out loudly. I only had her word that she hadn't watched me the entire time. I trusted her. 

I was shocked when after a few moments she appeared nearby, in her entirety. A naked slender beauty knelt down and studied the picture on the table. She turned to me, and I saw her wonder. 

"...how?..." 

She stood, her hand reaching out, touching her old belongings, running her hand across them. An old iron. A metal coffee pot. A large wooden chest, the lid twisted askew. An old china plate, with two tea cups and one saucer. A heavy cast iron pan. An odd shaped glass vase. The mirror. A set of nested rattan baskets. An ornate brass candlestick telephone. The largest item was a strange little table, with a padded surface on a little more than half of it, and a square raised wooden tabletop beside it, with a single drawer. None were in great condition. 

I had placed the small table against the wall. She stopped before it, looking back at me, and pointing at it. I nodded. She walked over to a space against a different wall, and pointed again. I moved it to where she indicated, and she knelt beside it, then touched the floor a few inches away. I shifted it over, and she stood. She waved at the old phone, and tapped the wooden surface. I placed it where she'd pointed. She sat on the padded seat, her hand stroking the wooden surface, grasping the phone. 

Her image shimmered, wavering and disappeared. A moment later I felt her hand in mine, and she was pulling me. I was towed into the bedroom, and her hands tugged at my belt. I undressed, and climbed in the bed, feeling her join me. 

I was hard in moments, and inside of her. She used me for a few moments, and her face appeared before mine. 

"...how?..." 

I explained my find, the odd coincidence, the generosity of the shopkeeper. "They are all yours, aren't they?" 

Her lips met mine, my cock still moving within her. A gentle tug on my right ear confirmed it. 

"There may be more. If there is, I'll try to get 'em. She'll be here on Sunday." 

Her movements accelerated, and I could no longer talk. I don't know how she did it, but she'd cranked up my need, and moments later I was beyond any chance of thought or reason, desperate to come for her. She moved down, took me in her mouth just in time for me to erupt. She finished me, gave me her touch, and then she was riding me again, my renewed hardness enveloped. 

"Can I call you Mary?" 

The tug. 'Yes.' 

I had a difficult request. "I... I'd like to give something to Bev and Karen. I was thinking the China cup and saucer for Bev, and the vase for Karen." 

The lips touched mine, she tugged my left ear, a clear 'No', and then she was doing it to me again, inflaming my desire, driving me crazy. I groaned, thrusting toward her. Moments later she was draining me. 

The entire experience hadn't taken ten minutes. Ten glorious, insane, heart- pounding minutes. I lay back gasping. She had other things in mind. Mary was impatient, taking my hand, tugging, drawing me off the bed. I followed, weak kneed as she led me up the stairs, and to the front bedroom to my right. I was guided to the fireplace. I saw the dust brushed away, and the large center stone on the bottom moving. I reached in and helped her. The back of the stone had two grooves, just deep enough to get your fingers under. It was heavy, and difficult to move. At least six inches thick, with a 2 inch lip. After I had moved it out of the way, a metal box rose out of the hole, over a foot long and eight inches wide. It was at least six inches deep, and looked solid. 

It landed in front of me, and the lid opened. It was nearly full. I saw jewelry, coins, and some papers on the bottom. A large necklace arose, and my hand was turned upward, the stunning piece placed in my palm. It was a flower, close to two inches across, numerous diamond encrusted petals set in white gold, with a huge yellow multi-faceted stone in the middle. It looked like a daisy. 

"For Bev?" I asked, nervously, handling an item which likely cost what I earned in a year. At least if those diamonds were real. 

Moments later I received my confirmation, with a gentle tug. 

From the box, what was clearly the matching ring emerged. A smaller flower, maybe half the pendant's size, it had the same pattern, the diamond petals, and the central bright yellow stone. My other hand was turned upright, and the ring placed in it. "Karen?" 

'Yes.' 

"It's too much, Mary. These are heirlooms, priceless. I should keep them with The House." 

A firm tug on my left ear let me know she disagreed. A very firm pull. 

"You're sure?" 

She almost pulled my right ear off. I had no idea she was that strong. Foolish me. 

"Alright, I get it. You're going to give them a hell of a Christmas." 

The jewelry was taken from me, placed back into the box which was closed. It rose and settled in my hand. 

"Thank you," was all I could say. I stood, and felt her lips against mine. 

I followed her back downstairs, her pull leading me along. I ended up in front of her family picture. 

"...thank you..." 

* * * 

I was restless at work, unable to concentrate. Luckily, we had an office party, and nobody seemed to notice. I left as early as I could get away with, eager to get to the airport. I had 11 days off, and only had to use my 2 floating holidays, not a single day of vacation. That was important, since I was down to less than 16 hours. My project had taken all my free time. 

Bev was flying into Dulles, which meant another 20 minutes to get to the airport, but I was still there half an hour early. I had made a brief stop on the way, and was watching the flight boards intensely, looking for their gate arrival. 

They were eight minutes early, which was great, but they were also the last ones off the plane. I was a nervous wreck, when I finally saw them exit the glass doors into the baggage claim area. I ran over to them, and their grins matched mine. I leaned over the wheelchair, and hugged Bev, never wanting to let her go. 

"I missed you," I told her softly. 

Karen pried my fingers off the flowers I was holding, while Bev hugged me back. "You are just a big baby, aren't you?" Bev teased. 

I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and turned to Karen. Our phone calls had been wonderful, but I was feeling just a little awkward. I needn't have worried. She calmly passed the flowers to Bev, then leaped into my arms, throwing her legs around me, and kissing me soundly. Of course I kissed her back. 

"Miss me too?" she asked, her tone teasing. 

"You have no idea." 

She let her legs slide to the ground, hugging me. "I think I have a damn good idea." 

Bev waved the flowers to get my attention, and I took them from her. "Uh, sorry about that." I sorted them out. One was a large wildflower bouquet, which I handed to Bev. The other, a small assortment of three roses, red, yellow and white. "I didn't know which kind you preferred," I said, handing them to Karen. 

"Are you kidding? I love them all. Thank you." 

There was considerably more baggage this time, it looked like they were planning to stay for a month, not a week. But then, I'm a guy. A pair of jeans and a half-dozen pair of socks, boxers and t-shirts, would have fit in a day- pack. 

The weather was cool, bordering on cold, and would get colder. It was supposed to hit 40 that night, nothing like the last time they'd been visiting. I was glad they were both wearing winter coats, I wasn't sure if they'd even have any. 

I cranked up the heat as soon as we were in the truck, directing the air-flow toward Bev. "It just got chilly in the last couple of days, timing kind of sucks," I said. 

Bev chuckled. "All the more reason to sit in front of the cozy fireplace, and drink a hot toddy." 

I'm not sure I even knew what a hot-toddy was. 

On the trip to the house, they queried me on the progress, and I caught them up-to-date. Not like they didn't know, with the nightly calls, and never-ending stream of photos. I'd been carefully filtering the pics, trying to keep a few things back for a surprise. 

I asked them how things were going at the home, and if there were any new stories from Weird John. We talked about what they normally did for Christmas, and about some of their favorite Christmas memories. I have to admit, I didn't know anything about their religious views, if any. 

I'm kind of a non-denominational Christian generalist, having been forced to attend a variety of denominations in the various foster homes growing up, none really sticking. I was raised with Christian values, and a hodgepodge of mixed guidance. I didn't think about religion much, and hadn't attended a service since the military. 

Bev was a regular churchgoer. Methodist, and attended most Sundays with several other residents at the home. She certainly wasn't one to push her religion on you, as demonstrated by the fact that I didn't even know what she was. 

Karen was a lapsed Catholic. She'd been married in the church, and had gone as a child, but stopped in college. She'd only been a dozen or so times in the last 10 years, a somewhat typical Easter/Christmas Catholic. 

They both had great stories about childhood Christmases but not much since then. Bev went on for a good 10 minutes about her last Christmas with her husband. Obviously one of her favorites. 

"To be honest," I told them, "I don't have a lot of great Christmas memories. I hope you two are going to help me change that." 

Karen patted me on the shoulder from the backseat. "I'm hoping that this might be the first of many magical holidays together." 

That was clear enough. 

The conversation was animated, and ate up the time driving to The House. It was good, keeping my mind off the biggest concern I had. Mary. 

The woods looked different, the fall foliage gone, many of the trees bare, a vast field of giant stick figures. The House didn't look much different, a few more windows in place since they'd been there last, but from the outside, pretty much the same, except the porch had been painted, white with green trim. Now it was nearly a perfect match for the old photo, right down to the chairs and swinging bench. Most of the surprises would be on the inside. 

I hadn't been home after work, so I knew I needed to get the fires going first, as soon as I got the ladies indoors. I lifted Bev out of the truck and into her wheelchair, and rolled her up to the front door. Karen jogged ahead and opened it for us. I barely had her in the door before she spoke up loudly. "Jack! Wait! Stop!" 

I got nervous, glancing around to see if Mary was up to something, and saw that Bev was staring at the telephone bench. "How... is that... where did you get that?" she gasped, rolling the chair forward on her own, reaching out to touch the padded bench, then grasping the antique brass candlestick phone. 

For a moment, I was too stunned to answer. Mary had been up to something. I don't know how much energy it cost her, but she'd moved things around. The family picture was over the living room mantle, not the picture of the house. The picture of her was no longer by the door. Strangest of all, a fire was burning in the living room fireplace. 

I'd setup the fireplaces before leaving that morning, so it wouldn't have been that much work to get it going. One of the foot-long fireplace matches would have done the job, but the fact that it was burning at all had me rattled. 

"Jack?" Bev asked, holding up the old phone, and looking back at me. 

"A, uh, antique store in town. You'll get to meet the owner on Sunday, when we have a few people over. She had a bunch of stuff she had bought at auction that was supposed to have come from this house. She sold it all to me." 

She looked around the room, her gaze returning to the stand. "How did you know it belonged here? I remember it perfectly. It was the first time I ever used a phone. They were so proud of it." 

How would I know? Good question. "It just seemed like the right place to put it." 

Karen had walked over to the fireplace, standing in front of it, warming her hands, examining the picture above the mantle. "Is this them?" 

"Let me see," Bev said, pointing, giving me directions. I pushed her over in front of the fire, took the picture off the wall and handed it to her. 

She examined it carefully. "That's my Uncle. I barely remember what Aunt Mary looked like, and never saw the baby. But that's Uncle Don." 

Karen was leaning over her shoulder. "They were a good looking family. He's a hot tamale, and she's gorgeous." 

Bev passed me the photo, and I came close to dropping it when I felt Mary's soft touch on my cheek. I carefully hung it back up. "Let me get the other fires going, and I'll unload the truck while you two get comfortable. I'll only be a moment." 

I moved from room to room, carrying a lit cedar strip with me, getting the fires started. In the dining room I found where the picture of the house had been relocated, sitting on the mantle. In my bedroom, I was alone. "Mary, are you here?" 

The tug on my right ear assured me she was listening. 

"Thanks for starting the fire. That was a kind gesture. Is it ok that they're here?" 

Another 'Yes' tug. 

I can't believe I'd avoided the simplest question about her presence while they were visiting. "Do you want me to let them know about you?" 

A firm tug on the left ear. 'No.' 

"Do you ever want them to know?" I looked around, hoping that my guests wouldn't see me seemingly talking to myself. 

'Yes.' 

"You'll let me know when you're ready?" 

I was hunched over the fire, while it had already started. I felt her lips graze mine, and the gentle tug of a 'Yes'. 

"Does it bother you that I'll be sleeping with Karen?" 

I had to wait a while. I never got an ear tug, just a poke in the nose. I almost laughed out loud. "I'm going to take that as mixed feelings." 

Another soft kiss. Then a teasing nibble at my lip. 

"I'll find time for you, I promise. I don't know how and when, but I will." 

I had spent too much time in the room already. I stood and felt a soft touch against my crotch. I was instantly hard. "Mary!" I hissed. 

I could almost swear I heard a giggle as I adjusted myself, and almost ran through the main hall out the door to fetch the luggage. I hoped the cool air would settle me down. Who knew that my damn permanent house guest was a tease? 

As I carted the luggage and boxes into the house, my thoughts returned to Karen and our relationship. Hard to avoid the thought, when I lifted her suitcase, and she nodded toward my room. It's clear she planned for us to take up where we'd left off last time. How could I tell her I had a girlfriend, as bizarre as it was. Was I cheating on her? Would I be cheating on Mary? What the fuck was I getting myself into? 

I didn't have to address the issue too soon. While I was unloading, they spent their time in the bathroom. They had brought enough to stay a while, it seemed. Four large suitcases, two big boxes, and their carryon bags. I was still finished before they were, and started lighting the kerosene lamps as it was starting to get dark out. 

As soon as the women came out of the bathroom, Karen headed for the kitchen. "I don't suppose you ate, either?" she said. 

"Nope. Not since lunch." 

"I'm going to whip something up. Anything off limits?" 

"No. I need to go shopping tomorrow, for Christmas dinner, and for having a few people over the next day." 

"What's a few?" Karen asked. 

"I think it's six adults and some kids, I don't know the numbers, so let's plan on an equal number of kids." 

Bev chuckled. "You don't know the number of kids? I take it these aren't close friends of yours." 

"Not close friends, but very generous and good friends. Andrew, the county inspector who's been helping me with all the paperwork and inspections to make this place legal, his wife Brianna and their kids. I think he has two. The other is the owner of the store who sold me the things scavenged from The House, her husband and her daughter's family. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm such a lousy host I don't even know her name, or that of any of her family." 

That got me some ribbing for being such a man. Karen was so outgoing, I had little doubt she would have had the names, birthdays, next-of-kin, and past history out of both of them after their first meeting. 

I sat down next to Bev, relaxing before dinner. It already felt like home again, with the two women in the house. It had felt empty without them. Mary had been welcome company, ameliorating my loneliness, but the noise of the women's presence, the sound of footsteps, the chattering, clattering of utensils, brought the place to life. 

"Thanks for the changes in the bathroom. It helps a lot," Bev said. I imagine it was an uncomfortable subject. I'd installed heavy duty rails beside the toilet. I'd added a seat for the bath that could be removed. 

"In the future, would you rather I added a powered lift to get you upstairs, or convert the downstairs bath to your needs." 

She looked at me curiously. "What are you saying, Jack?" 

"When you come to stay. Would you rather have your bedroom upstairs, or remain down here. Upstairs the room will be larger, and I can design the bathroom to be friendlier. Otherwise I can convert the one down here." 

"The way things are now is fine. It's not worth the effort for a week's visit. There's so much more you can do with your time," she insisted. 

I shook my head. "I'm not saying this right. I want you to stay. Stay here with me. Live in our house. Would you rather be upstairs with me, or down here?" 

She looked surprised. It was a few moments before she responded. "Jack, I'm not well. I would be a lot of trouble. You don't want an old crippled woman in your house. I need care. It's just not reasonable." 

I turned and took her hand in mine. "I don't give a damn about reasonable, Bev. I need you here. I miss you all the time. This is our home. We've built it together. You've been beside me every step of the way. You're going to live here. The only question is upstairs or downstairs." 

"No, Jack. I'm fine where I am. You can invite me out to visit now and then, and I'd appreciate it. You're young. You're going to want a wife and family soon. Young people to fill this house. I won't be a burden to you. It's not fair. Not fair to you, or to the family you'll have one day." 

"Bev, you need to understand, as far as I'm concerned, you are my family. My entire family. Any woman that would consider you a burden is not the kind of woman I would want to marry and have children with. I love you, Bev, like the mother I never knew, and I want to see you every day. I want to hear your laughter, and put up with your nagging and teasing. I won't be happy without you here with me. In our home." 

She was shaking her head slowly, and I saw her eyes glistening. 

I continued, "If it's your friends at the home, you can go to visit them as regularly as you want. If you're concerned about the winter weather, you can even be a snowbird, alternating your time between here and there. I'll miss the hell out of you, but we can make it work out. Don't leave me here alone."  

===

"It all sounds so wonderful, Jack, but I don't think it's feasible. I can't take care of myself. I have my medications, doctors. I need full-time assistance. You have your job, and you need to move on with your life once you've finished this project." 

I laughed. "We can work it out. Heck, I can sell off a chunk of the land, and we'll have more than enough money to hire a full-time nurse. We have plenty of room in the house. Four huge bedrooms upstairs, and enough space on the third floor to house an entire staff if need be. I earn a good living, and once I finish most of the work, my expenses will drop to almost nothing. If you want to do this, I guarantee we can make it work. You should know I can be as stubborn as you. I've only had my Mom for about 9 months, there's no way I'm letting her get away." 

Her hands squeezed mine, a few tears etching their way down her cheeks. "I never expected this. It's very sudden, and a little scary. I'm 88 years old, and have spent the last 17 years in Sunset. You've only been around me for a few days. I'm not an easy person to live with. Just ask Karen. What if you get tired of me? What if you change your mind? You're talking about a major upheaval in your life." 

I just grinned. "Upstairs or downstairs?" 

"Are you even listening to me, Jack?" 

"I listen to every word you say, crazy old woman. I just don't care about the issues. We'll work them out. You belong with me, and that's where you're going to end up. You can decide now, or you can dilly-dally for a day, a week, a month. When it's all said and done, my Mom will live with me. The only question is whether I set you up down here, or at the top of the stairs on the left." 

"And I don't have any say in it, I suppose?" she said. 

"Of course you do! That's why I'm asking. Upstairs or downstairs?" 

"You know you're a very frustrating young man." 

"I love you too. I think upstairs would be better. Rather than put in one of those ugly chair things that go up the stairs, I can put in a simple lift in the back of the house beside the pantry. It's best to do it now before I finish the upstairs." 

Karen called out from the kitchen. "If you two can stop plotting over there, I could use some help setting the table. Dinner will be in five minutes." 

I got up and gave Bev a kiss on the cheek. "You don't have to decide now. I can give you until Monday. That's when I'll start the changes to put in the lift." 

I left her staring into the fire, while I went to do my share of the dinner preparation. 

It was too soon to bring it up, but when I saw myself in the future, I pictured Karen by my side. It was insane, I know. I'd never been able to sustain any relationship with a woman for more than a few months. The truth was, I never saw any need to, I wasn't interested in long term. I wasn't ready for it. Somehow, that had changed, sneaking up on me. Maybe it was The House. Maybe I was just getting older. It could have been all the thinking I'd been doing about Mary and Don, and having a family. Whatever it was, when I thought about finishing The House, in my mind, Karen was there with me. 

There was no way I was going to bring it up so soon. I'd probably scare her away, screaming, running for the hills. I'd spent 72 hours with the woman, and talked to her on the phone for less than two months. Even I'd have to wonder about my sanity. Never mind the whole Mary business. 

I set the table, and stood behind her, sliding my arms around her waist. "I can't tell you how glad I am that you're here." 

She chuckled, wiggling her butt against me. "I'll let you show me a little later. Go get cranky, dinner's ready." 

We weren't seated five minutes before Bev set her silverware down, and turned to Karen. "Did you know about this?" 

Karen looked confused, rightfully so. "About what?" 

"His plans. Upstairs or downstairs." 

"What plans?" Karen asked. 

"She has no idea, Bev. It's my idea, and I wouldn't dream of talking to anybody else without discussing it with you first," I said. 

"Not much discussing, is there? You've already made your mind up." 

Now I was the one that was confused. I thought she'd be happy. It was right, I knew it was. "Are you mad at me? Am I wrong? Don't you want to be with me?" 

Karen looked back and forth between us, her forehead wrinkled in confusion. "What are you guys talking about?" 

Bev turned toward her. "He expects me to move in here. Soon, from the sounds of things. He wants me to choose whether my room should be upstairs or downstairs." 

"Upstairs?" Karen asked. 

"I'll put in a lift over there," I said, pointing to the back of the house. 

"Upstairs, then." She grinned. "This is wonderful! Aren't you ecstatic! You're always talking about what it would be like to live here." 

Bev blushed, and took a sip of her wine. "Be reasonable. I'd just be in his way." 

"Bullshit," Karen said, never one to mince words. "This place has all the space you need. The man can build a house of matchsticks and spit, he sure as hell can do whatever it takes to make things easy for you. For what you're paying at the home, you can hire a full-time live in staff. What's there to think about?" 

"His life, for one. What kind of life will he have if he has to spend all his time taking care of me? How will he ever meet a woman, settle down, raise a family, if I'm underfoot? It's not fair to him." 

Karen snorted, and it wasn't very lady like. "Now you're just arguing for the sake of arguing. You two are good for each other, and you damn well know it." She turned back to me. "Upstairs. That's where she'll be, and her nurse can be in one of the other rooms, or up on the third floor. That way you won't have to retrofit the first floor bath either. You're sure you can put in some kind of elevator?" 

"Yeah, I have plenty of space. If it's just between the first floor and second floor, it can be pretty reasonable. If it has to go to the third floor, it will more than double the cost, but it could be useful to get things up there if I need to use that space." 

"I would imagine the two story model would be fine. What kind of time frame are you talking about?" Karen asked. 

Bev interrupted. "Hey! This is my life you're talking about." 

"You don't want him spending all that money just to get to the third floor, do you?" Karen asked. 

"Of course not!" 

"And you don't want the whole world knowing your business, living on the first floor, your bathroom shared with all the guests, right?" 

I just sat back and let Karen do all the heavy lifting. I should have gotten her involved in the first conversation. 

"I didn't even say I was going to do it!" Bev snapped. 

"Of course you are. I don't imagine the house will be ready until the spring, it'll give us plenty of time to do everything you need to get moved here. Now stop being so obstinate and thank the man. You know you want this as much as he does." 

Bev shook her head. "It's not fair to him." 

"Of course it is. You've had more life in you the last several months than you have in years. You two are family. You belong in this house, and if you'd stop playing the martyr, you'd admit it," Karen insisted. 

I grabbed Bev's hand, giving it a squeeze. "I don't want to railroad you into something you don't want to do. You need to know this is something I want just as much as I wanted to fix up this place. It won't be complete without you. I won't nag you anymore, just think about it. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. It's what I want. The only question is: do you want to be here, with me, in our home? Think about that." I winked at her. "And once you've decided, let me know if it's upstairs or downstairs." 

"I won't be a burden to you," Bev insisted. 

"Good. I'm glad we agree on that. You'd never be a burden, Mom." 

She shook her head at me, but she was smiling. That was good. "You are a stubborn one, aren't you?" 

I laughed. "If I wasn't, I'd never have met you, would I? I wouldn't have a chance to live my dream. I wouldn't have a family." 

"We'll talk about it later, Ok? This isn't something you decide spur of the moment. It's complicated. There are so many things we'd have to deal with." 

"Tell me about it. It's like The House. I had no idea how difficult or complicated it would be. Still, the decision was made in a single moment. Once you agreed to let me fix it up, everything else was just details. It's the same with us. The decision is easy, the details we can manage." 

Bev finally laughed. "Alright, already. Let a woman breathe! You said I could tell you Monday." 

"Great. Monday it is. Unless you want to tell me Saturday morning. That would be the best Christmas gift you could give me." 

"Don't press your luck, Jack. Monday," Bev said. 

That was the last of that subject for the moment. I readily fell into my new role, cleaning the dishes and watched Karen disappear into the bedrooms, doing some unpacking. I poured myself a scotch, gave the fire a poke and settled in next to Bev. 

"No tree, Jack?" she asked. 

"I was going to cut one from the property, but couldn't find a decent one. Kind of funny, all these trees and none the right type or small enough. Besides, I couldn't decorate it until you guys were here." 

We talked about our preference in tree types, and Karen joined us, the conversation turning toward decorations. Another issue I had, owning almost no decorations to speak of. On my own, I had never even put up a tree. 

It was later than they were used to staying up, and Bev was knackered. Her word, not mine. Karen took her to the room, and moments later they were calling for me. I hurried over and saw they were checking out the mirror. 

"Yeah, that was one of the items," I said. 

Bev nodded, "It's lovely, but it belongs out in the hall. It used to be near the phone table, so you could check yourself before you went out. It's a miracle you could find any of this original stuff. You'll have to show me what else you found." She smiled. "Tomorrow, I can barely keep my eyes open right now." 

"Of course. There were only a dozen or so items. Get your rest, we have a busy day tomorrow," I said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. 

I banked the fire in the dining room, and locked up. It was a little chilly to move the party out to the porch, as much as I loved it. I sat in front of the hearth, waiting for Karen to settle Bev in for the night. 

My hair was mussed, and I turned to find myself alone. "Hi beautiful," I whispered. 

I got my spectral kiss, and felt something new. A weight settling in my lap. "This is nice, isn't it?" 

'Yes.' 

She was acting odd. Doing things around the house, sitting in my lap. "You're not jealous, are you?" 

I got another kiss, and a fluttering touch against my right ear. "A little?" 

The kiss was long, different, teasing, opening my lips. I opened my eyes, and saw hers gazing into mine, for only a moment. 

"Save your energy, beautiful. It's going to be difficult to keep you fueled up." 

The weight disappeared. "Who're you talking to?" I heard Karen say from nearby. 

Shit. "I'm going crazy. I find myself talking to The House all the time now," I explained. 

She came over and sat in my lap. I saw her big smile when she felt the erection that Mary had left me. "I guess you missed me." 

"What do you think?" I teased, wrapping my arms around her. 

Her arms slid around my neck, and I was kissing my second girl, only moments apart. Except this time, my hands could wander, caressing her body, imagining possessing it shortly. She must have had the same idea. She broke off the kiss, and pulled her shirt off over her head. I ran my hands down her sides, noting that her love handles were almost gone. She hadn't been heavy, her body deliciously soft and curvy. It seemed like she'd slimmed down a few of the curves. 

I hoped she wouldn't lose much more. I loved the way she was. Awesomely feminine. Still, I imagined she worked hard to do it. "I never would have thought you could have gotten any sexier. I guess I was wrong. You look amazing." 

She beamed. "It was just a couple of pounds," she said. 

"Just the right amount. Any more, and you might lose some of these fabulous curves," I told her, sliding my hands around her hips, up her waist, and cupping her breasts. 

She giggled, leaning into my hands. "Maybe a few more off the hips," she said. 

"God, I hope not much. I love your shape, and your ass it to die for." 

"Please, I've got a fat ass," she said, brushing my hands away from where they'd dropped down to squeeze her butt cheeks. 

I pulled her head down and kissed her deeply, feeling her relax, leaning into me. "I love the way you are," I whispered. 

"You don't think my butt's too big?" she asked. 

It's something I didn't understand about women. They always seemed to be unhappy with their looks. Why couldn't they understand a man didn't want to make love to a stick? A man wants something to hold onto. An ass with some give to it, breasts that shook when her body moved. Soft padded flesh, not skin and bones. Skinny women might look gorgeous, dressed in the latest fashion. Real women looked better once those clothes came off. 

"Why don't we retire to the bedroom, and I'll let you know." 

"Eager, are we?" she teased. 

"I think I've been extremely patient." 

She smiled and brushed my lips with hers. "You have been. You deserve a little reward." 

"A couple of rewards?" 

She laughed as she climbed out of my lap. "I think we can manage that." 

She was as eager as I. I pushed her onto the bed and stripped her naked. Alright, I was wrong, the pounds she'd lost hadn't taken away any of her curves, only accentuated them. "God, you're beautiful," I said, stripping off my pants while taking in her nude form. 

She blushed. "Thank you. I... I'm a little intimidated. Your body is so magnificent, and mine is so blah." 

I laughed, shedding my shirt and pulling her to the center of the bed. I was hard and ready, and took only a few moments to push inside of her, hearing her sexy moan. "I'm hardly magnificent, and trust me, if anyone should be intimidated it's me. You are sexiness incarnate." 

She gasped as I pounded into her, without any preparation. "Can you tell, Jack? Can you feel it? How my body responds to you? I've never felt this before, what you do to me." 

I couldn't talk. Could barely think. I leaned over her, pumping her desperately. My need should not have been so great. I'd come four times the day before, and once that morning. Yet it felt like I'd been without sex for a year. She was responding underneath me, grunting under my ardent attention. She was so beautiful, her face reflecting her desire for me, her tits shaking with each new thrust, her hips meeting mine, matching my need. 

After only a few minutes, I was done, unable to hold back any longer. I dropped down, clutching her in my arms, breathing hard, my head buried in her shoulder. I felt her fingers digging into my flesh, fingernails tearing my skin. My thrusting was animalistic, pounding her frantically until I erupted inside of her, pumping her full. 

I gasped, panting, trying to press even deeper into her, my cock straining to claim her even more. I slowly recovered my senses, bracing my arms, lifting my weight off of her. She took a deep breath, staring at me in wonder. Her lips turned upward and she chuckled. "I guess you did miss me a little." 

I kept pumping her gently, while the remains of my erection allowed me. "Just a little? You think?" 

She turned her head, kissing my forearm. "That was incredible," she answered. "I've never felt so wanted, so... feminine." 

I was looking into her eyes, when I felt an intrusive touch. Mary was with us. Her touch trailed down my back, brushing my rear, then rubbed me where I was inside of Karen. She gasped, her eyes opening wide, and I felt her body tremble beneath me, as I became stone hard inside of her. 

"Ornery girl," I laughed, as I long-stroked Karen. 

Whatever the touch did for me, apparently it had similar results for her. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and she trembled underneath me, the tendons on her neck straining, mouth open in a silent scream, her hands clutching at open air. I pushed her legs back, tilting her hips up. My arms reached around her knees, holding her exposed, as I continued driving deeply inside of her, slow and steady, enjoying the feeling. 

She was an open nerve, coming frequently, moaning, grunting, nonsense words escaping her lips. She had stopped breathing, her head tossing side to side, turning red. I slowed my motion, then drove deep inside of her, grinding deep, holding steady. I leaned down and kissed her, waiting for her to come to her senses. 

She took a huge breath, and reached up for me, pulling me down hard, arms and hands clutching me. "Oh, God!" she groaned, as I started thrusting into her again. Her hands weren't the only ones touching me. My spectral girlfriend was caressing my lower back, sliding down my thighs. I was nervous she'd touch my cock again, or worse, do whatever she had to Karen, and possibly drive her insane. 

Fortunately, Mary's touch was gentle, but not intimate. I continued driving into Karen, watching her respond, in a more normal fashion. 

"Don't stop," she moaned. "Never stop." 

Never is a long time, but I knew it wouldn't be soon, as long as Mary didn't intervene. I rolled her over onto her belly, entered her again, and lay on top of her, pinning her down, feeling her soft ass give with each stroke. I loved that feeling, and told her so. 

"I've decided. Your ass is perfect. Don't change anything." 

She trembled, her head turned to the side, eyes closed, her ass-cheeks shoving back against me. I loved the position, my hands free to move, my weight pressing her into the bed, her pussy open, available. My legs surrounded hers, knees outside her thighs, ankles over her calves, controlling her. I reached underneath her body, grabbing her tits, mauling them, while I continued to possess her. 

Her body responded as I could never imagine possible. It felt incredible, making her mine, toying with her, pleasuring her beyond anything I thought feasible. Her response was the ultimate turn-on. 

I didn't change anything, but I felt her response changing, her pleasure building. I nibbled on her neck, squeezing her tits, pumping her steadily. She tensed up, her groans accelerating, hands clutching at the sheets. "N-n-n-ooo, no, no, no, no," she gasped, her no's becoming louder. 

Her excitement was contagious, exciting me. My thrusting grew more urgent. "Come for me, you dirty girl," I growled into her ear, as I felt my finish impending. I bit down on her neck, making her moan. 

Her grunts were no longer intelligible, simple sounds of surrender, goading me onward. "Come, damn it!" I demanding, pounding into her. 

"Gonna. Fill. You. UP!" I said, reaching for my release, the pressure already beyond my ability to resist. "Aaaah!" I grunted, slamming my cock to the root, coming painfully hard. 

Karen screamed her own huge release, coming on my spurting cock, shaking beneath me, while I continued vacating my balls inside her warm confines. 

When I rolled off of her, exhausted, physically shot, she continued lying where she was, breathing hard, clearly as worn out as I was. I gasped as Mary intruded, feeling her movement around my cock, cleaning it and leaving me hard, without the wherewithal to do anything about it. I moaned as she took care of me. 

I looked over to find Karen staring at me. "Jesus, Jack! What the hell was that?" 

"I missed you, beautiful." 

"Holy shit! That was insane! I never, ever felt anything like it. I thought I was going to lose my mind there for a bit." She slid over next to me resting her head on my chest, her soft hand caressing me possessively. She reached down and pulled the covers up, cuddling in closer. 0 

===

"You bastard," she mumbled, "You've ruined me. Ruined me for anyone else." 

"Good," I answered, pulling the covers over her shoulders, kissing the top of her head. At the same time, the covers were moved away from my waist, my greedy girl refusing me rest, her ghostly touch taking its time milking me for her need. 

When she'd satisfied herself, she covered my shivering form and I faded away into slumber. 

* * * 

I woke to the smell of coffee, on the verge of another release for my demanding phantasmal guest. I chuckled. "Used up a lot of energy, didn't you?" 

Her movements increased in intensity and I groaned through my finish, trying to keep it down. I glanced over at the closed door. "You can go again," I said softly. "It's going to be difficult to find private time for you for the next couple of days." 

I leaned back and stifled a moan as my tortured cock rose again from her mystical touch. 

I was feeling the guilt again, with no idea what I could do about it. Her stroking was working its magic. "You're really Ok with Karen?" 

The motion below paused, and I received a hint of a kiss and a gentle ear tug. 'Yes.' 

Then she was back to business, getting me off a few teasing minutes later. Foolishly, I offered her one more, the guilt gnawing away at me. When she was finished, I was spent, totally drained. It took more energy than I thought I had to make it to the bathroom, stumbling, crawling under the shower, waiting for the water to heat up. I huddled in the tub, the water beating down upon me, until it was too scalding to stand, and I took a half-hearted swipe at the cold water knob. A few minutes later my shivering had stopped, and my heart rate was near human. 

"You alive?" I heard Karen's voice tease. 

"Barely. No thanks to you, wild child," I told her, trying to hide my weakness. 

She laughed that sweet, full laugh of hers. "No way, buster. You're not putting that on me. I was the innocent victim." 

"Innocent?" 

"I was! At least before you got your evil hands on me." 

She walked into the bathroom, and placed a coffee mug in my hand. "Clean up your act, handsome. I know it's your house but I don't think Bev's heart will survive another naked stroll through the house." 

"Oh crap," I moaned, after sipping from the life-giving brew. 

She giggled. "I appreciate the welcome last night, but I think we need to dial it back. You look like death warmed over this morning, and I'm not sure I'll ever walk normally again." 

I didn't answer, gripping my cup with both hands, sipping away. 

"You've got about 10 minutes. How do you like your eggs?" 

"Anything but raw." 

"Scrambled alright?" 

I nodded mutely, then ducked my head under the running water. Ten minutes. It was going to be a long day. 

* * * 

Once I had breakfast in me, I felt considerably better. I shared my list of errands with the women, and less than an hour later we were out the door. I'll admit, working with Bev made everything take a little longer, but I didn't mind. I was thankful for the truck; the bed was a handy place to carry her wheelchair. 

Rather than start in town, I hit the highway, and cruised another 15 minutes south toward Fredericksburg. Just off the exit were a couple of shopping centers, and a Wal-Mart. Perfect for my immediate needs. By the time lunchtime had arrived, the backseat of the truck barely had room for Karen. We had our groceries, decorations, and quite a few odds and ends. For me that included jewelry cases, some more gifts, and wrapping paper. 

They were happy to hit one of the local restaurants, and I was feeling on top of the world, eating with my two lovely guests, and having accomplished 90% of what I'd intended. 

"That covers most of my needs," I explained. "Anything particular you guys want to do?" 

Bev shook her head. "I found everything I wanted," she said, sipping her drink. She had insisted on going through a separate check-out than me, and had a few bags bulging with mystery contents. 

Karen echoed her sentiments. "Enough for the next couple of days. I think we're done." 

"No, not quite done," I reminded her. "We still have to get a tree. Don't let me forget to buy a tree stand, as well." 

"What are the plans for tomorrow?" Bev asked. "Do you mind if we go to Sunday service?" 

I hadn't thought of that. "I don't know which church is which, in town. I think there are at least three. We can check it out. I'm guessing you'd like to go to a Methodist church." I glanced back at Karen. "Is that Ok with you?" 

She nodded. "Christmas Day service is fine. I'm willing to go wherever Bev wants." 

I figured I could kill two birds with one stone. I knew that there was a church on the way into town, with a Christmas tree lot out front. I imagined it would be slim pickings, but we'd find something. 

It was the first time for the women to see Millville. I figured the population for somewhere around 10,000-12,000. The old downtown area was six blocks long, running parallel to the water, and there was a decent sized shopping center before you hit the entrance to the highway. 

Bev was willing to provide her opinion from inside the warm cab of the truck, as I dragged over tree after tree, and displayed them for her. Ten minutes later, we'd picked out our favorite, and it was tossed in the bed of the truck. The church was Catholic, but they were happy enough to point us toward the Methodist church. We drove by and checked out the Christmas day service times, listed out front. 

As we drove through the downtown, storefronts and light-posts decorated for the holiday, Bev expressed her approval. "Not too gaudy, but definitely in the spirit of things. It looks like a nice place. Clean." 

"I'm surprised there's this many places open on Christmas Eve," Karen said. 

"Anyone up for a treat?" I asked, when I saw the local social hot spot was open. A family owned ice cream emporium called the Double Dip. "Decadent homemade ice cream," I teased. 

"I don't imagine one little sundae with chocolate syrup, nuts and a cherry would hurt," Bev said casually. 

Karen got a single scoop cone, dipped in chocolate. I was convinced they served the richest, most delicious chocolate shake in the free world, and ordered a large. I bought two gallons of their ice cream for our dinner party. Chocolate and vanilla. Yes, chocolate was my idea. It was my weakness. 

We drove to The House in quiet, each of us intent on satisfying our sugar craving. Slowly cruising up the dirt lane, I sighed. "I love this." 

"The view? It is gorgeous," Karen said. 

"No, doing these errands with you two. Enjoying a morning out, and leisurely sharing a treat, instead of gobbling it down alone." 

Bev nodded. "It is nice, isn't it?" 

"Perfect," I said. 

As we crested the hill, I heard Karen cry out from the backseat. "Hey! What's that under our tree?" 

"That's one of your Christmas presents, nosy. You're not supposed to be peeking." 

"Peeking? How can I miss it?" 

I turned and drove across the grass, over to the old oak. I had cleared away a few nearby smaller trees, and the underbrush. A half circle bench surrounded the bole of the tree, and a picnic table stood a few feet away. It took most of a day, to complete it all, but it looked damned inviting, if I do say so myself. 

Karen laughed. "Can't you do anything half-assed, Jack? It's perfect. It seems everything you turn your hand to is perfect." 

"Hardly. I was hoping to put in a path from the house, and never got that far. The bench around the tree was supposed to go all the way around it, but I couldn't figure out a way to work around the big root in back, and gave up. I guess it's good enough. Up close you'll see there's plenty of flaws in the woodwork." 

Bev chuckled. "She's right, Jack. It's perfect. I can only imagine how delightful it will be to sit under the tree in spring, relaxing, reading a book, the hilltop breezes rusting in the leaves. Idyllic." 

"Karen gets the credit. It's her idea. I'm just the manual laborer." 

I pulled up to the house, and parked in front. It took us a few minutes to get Bev situated, and the fires stoked. The house was still warm. The foot thick stone and triple paned windows provided excellent insulation. The multiple layers of decking and flooring above seemed to do a decent job as well. Once we had everything out of the truck and into the house, I got a little assistance putting up the tree, and the decorating started. 

Music was something I enjoyed, but I didn't have much of a stereo. Just a simple old fashioned boom-box which played CDs. I placed my solitary CD of Christmas music in the holder, and cranked it up, while we decorated the tree with the new decorations. When we were done, it was still rather sparse, but it looked damned good to me. 

Before we started with the rest of the decorations, Karen brewed up some spiked eggnog which we enjoyed while decorating The House. I saw a garland I had placed on the dining room fireplace mantle move by itself, and I was reminded of my spectral guest. 

"Join me in the bedroom?" I said softly, in her direction. 

I felt guilty leaving her out. I took a few small decorations into the bedroom, and placed them on the bed. "Help me decorate our room?" I whispered. I got a quick little kiss, and watched in amazement as the shiny silver garland moved to the headboard. It made me feel amazingly good, that she'd play along. I placed a few things around the room, a nutcracker, a sitting elf, some evergreen branches, and watched as they were each adjusted. I noticed for the first time her picture on the wall, where she'd moved it. 

I walked over to the picture, once more reminded of her beauty, and the life she'd lost. "I've got to go back. I'll see you in a bit. How about a kiss?" 

I received my requested gift, a nice soft lingering touch to my lips, and another teasing rub of the crotch. 

"Damn it, Mary! I've gotta go out there like this," I griped teasingly. 

She ruffled my hair, and gave my right ear lobe a tug. Ornery thing. 

As we finished up the bulk of the decorations, I was given new orders. The women had some wrapping to do. I had to take one of Karen's boxes and move it to Bev's room, and I was told to make myself scarce for a while. 

"It works both ways," I told them. "I've got some wrapping to do as well, so no interruptions." 

Bev glared at me. "I hope you didn't do anything crazy. Having me here is gift enough. That and our beautiful tree oasis outside." 

"Not too much," I told her, knowing full well I was going to catch hell for the jewelry. "I need a minute. I'm going to do my stuff upstairs so I'll be completely out of your way." 

"That works," Karen said. "We'll go into the bedroom. Give us a knock when you head up stairs. We'll let you know when we're done." 

Bev laughed at our antics. "Geez, you two! It's just Christmas present wrapping. Not international intrigue. We don't need to make such a big deal out of it." 

Once they'd moved into the room, I hit my own, closing the door behind me. "Mary, I need you." 

I almost jumped out of my skin, when her eyes appeared before mine, twinkling. I got a quick kiss, and a rub. And like that, I was ready. I reclined on the bed, as my pants made a quick journey to my ankles. My ornery girl was in a hurry. She got like that sometimes. It only took a few minutes of her attention to have me stifling a groan, erupting into her demanding mouth. 

Taking a moment to catch my breath, I pulled my pants back up. "I'm going to wrap the presents now. I'd like you to do me a favor. Can you stay with the girls? I'd like a little privacy." 

I received a brief kiss, and a tug on the ear. Then she was gone. 

It was odd, I'll admit it. I couldn't always tell when she was around, but most of the time I knew when she wasn't. Ok, I know that doesn't make any sense. It was more a case of, when she had been around, making her presence known, I knew when she left. If that makes any clearer. Oh, never mind. Suffice it to say, she was no longer with me, and I knew it. 

I made a quick trip out to my trailer, gathered up the presents, found my wrapping paper, tape and scissors and retreated upstairs. 

Wrapping the gifts for Bev and Karen was easy enough. I placed the jewelry in the cases I'd bought, and did the best I could wrapping. Let's just say that's not a skill I've mastered, but I did what I could. I attempted to hide the nature of the gifts, by placing the small objects inside of larger boxes, which I did a similarly poor job of wrapping. 

The bigger job was for Mary. I had retrieved the family portrait, and removed the photo and glass. The picture glass had not survived well. One corner was cracked, the soot seemed permanent. I had some reservations about replacing the 80 year old glass with modern, but I brushed those aside. The antique frame meant little to me, it was the picture that mattered. Ten minutes and two failed attempts working with a glass cutter for the first time, finally yielded a replacement for the frame. I cleaned it the best I could, put the glass back in, and gently wiped down the photo, testing a corner to make sure I wouldn't damage it. I put the whole thing back together, and examined the picture closely for the first time. 

There was no denying Mary was a beautiful young woman. They looked so happy, it broke my heart thinking of how little time they had together. I noticed for the first time, she was wearing the necklace that I was about to give to Bev. I couldn't see it, but I had no doubt she'd been wearing the ring as well. 

I wrapped the picture in holiday paper, only covering the front, leaving the back exposed, so I could hang it, while still wrapped. 

There were a couple of more items I still needed to wrap. I was done sooner than I expected, and transported the gifts downstairs under the tree. The final job I had to do was to hang the stockings from the mantle. I hung four. One each for Bev, Karen, and myself. The other was for Mary, of course. I had decided to tell the women it was in honor of the previous inhabitants. It wasn't a lie, just not the entire truth. 

Standing near the door to Bev's room, I could hear the women chatting and laughing. I stepped back, not wanting to intrude, but I did want to get one of their attention. 

"Mary?" I whispered. 

I waited, and didn't detect her presence. I called out to her two more times with no success. We didn't have many chances to be alone, Mary and I, so I improvised. 

I knocked on the door, opening it a crack. "It's me," I called out. "I'm almost done, I'll be upstairs if you need me. I hung some stockings, but I didn't know if you had your own, so let me know when you're ready." 

Karen appeared in the open door, grinning. "You're not trying to peek, are you? Naughty boys get coal in the stocking." 

"No peeking. I just wanted to let you know I'm finished down here, so you have the first floor to yourself. I'll be upstairs if anyone wants to come up." 

She giggled. "You're acting weird, Jack. Now get lost, or there'll be nothing under the tree. Give us a little time." 

I leaned forward for a kiss, taking a quick glance around the room. She chuckled and pushed me away. "You're just like a little kid! Don't tell me you weren't trying to peek. Now behave or I swear, no Christmas goodies for you!" Her eyes twinkled as she gave a quick meaningful glance down below my waist. 

"Meanie," I told her, stealing a quick kiss before retreating. I headed back upstairs, and waited a moment to see if Mary had gotten the hint. "You here?" I asked softly. 

My belt unbuckling answered that readily enough. 

I chuckled. "No rush, I think we have plenty of time. We can go twice if you want." I stepped out of my pants, reclining on a couple of the thick pads I had lying about while working. "I'd like that. Slow and easy, if we could." 

My girl was willing. She took her time, teasing, playful. For the second round, she unbuttoned my shirt, and went for the real deal. Her lips pressed against mine, as she mounted me. 

"I love when you do it like this," I told her, feeling the decadent movement on my cock, her touch soft on my chest, my face. Her nether embrace solidified, firming up, a slight pressure impacting my hips and thighs with each movement. I groaned my enjoyment, hoping she'd let it go on for a while, no hurry, just an intimate moment for the two of us. 

My God, she felt good. 

"C...Can I see you? Just for a moment?" 

Her face slowly appeared before mine, a smile on her lips, those dark eyes of her searing. They closed, while she moved up and down. Then she faded away, leaving me yearning. 

Her movement accelerated, firmer, more demanding. I felt the adjustment as my cock pointed upward, ridden hard. I almost laughed, thoroughly distracted, when her breasts made a brief appearance, bouncing up and down, in time with the pressure on my cock. 

"Go ahead and tease me, you wicked thing." 

I moaned when the view of my shaft disappeared, her pubic hair blocking the sight. It was beyond bizarre, watching my rod disappear inside of her, only a tiny bit of her visible, the top of her thighs, her crotch, her wild curly growth. I reached down to touch her, feeling the resistance, my finger gliding through her hair, down to her cleft. 

Her up and down movement stopped, becoming an insistent grinding while I felt a pulsing around my shaft. It was too much. I groaned her name, and thrust upward, amazed when she didn't immediately pull away, letting me finish inside of her. I hated to lose the sight of her, when she disappeared. 

I collapsed backward, exhausted, completely spent. I pulled the pad around my shoulders when I felt her touch again, gentle, cleaning me. I almost laughed. Didn't want to waste any of it. Not after working that hard. 

The tug on my shirt brought me to my senses. Mary was trying to button it. I reached for my pants, pulling them up, and adjusted my shirt. I lay back down, waiting for the chill to leave, enjoying her touch, as the buttons on my shirt slowly closed, from the waist up. 

I pulled the pad closer around my shoulders, resting, recovering. "Stay with me a bit," I asked softly. 

'Yes'. A tiny kiss confirmed her presence. 

My eyes were closed, and I was totally relaxed. "Someday, I want to fall asleep with you in my arms." 

Her answering kiss was long and firm. A 'Yes' if I'd ever heard one. 

* * * 

She was in my arms, solid, yet soft. Her lips on mine, real and demanding. Her touch once more aroused me, and I moaned. I almost said her name out loud, before I heard her words. 

"Jack, time to wake up. Nap time's over." 

I was still in a haze, half-asleep, but I recognized who I held. I drew Karen close. "Don't wanna. Stay." 

She kissed me again, her hands gliding over my chest, her fingers opening a button, the buttons which Mary had worked so hard to close. Karen's hand slid inside, flesh on flesh. "I'd stay forever," she whispered, "But Cranky's worked up. Besides, I need to start dinner." 

I hugged her close, pressing my face into her hair. Smelling her, nibbling her neck. "Stay with me." 

She settled down, no longer so insistent, content in my arms. It was all so wonderful. So right. 

"Love you," I whispered, without thinking. 

I immediately felt the change in her, a tensing, followed by an attempt to crawl into my skin. "Not like this, lover," she whispered nervously. "Tell me when you're awake. Tell me then." 

For a moment I'd felt nervous, then it slipped away. I moved my lips over hers, a soft kiss, that heated up, growing passionate, before cooling again, our lips gently grazing each others. "Won't change anything. You know it." 

Her hand stroked my cheek, and I opened my eyes to find her gazing on me lovingly, the look unmistakable. 

"Later, please, Jack. I need to hear it when you're clear-headed." 1 

===

I rolled with her, putting her on her back, kissing her firmly. "Whatever you need. I...I was afraid to tell you. It's too soon. I didn't want to scare you away." 

She awarded me a shy little smile. "You could never scare me away. You should know that by now." 

"I love you, Karen McCoy. Like no woman I've ever known." 

"Please don't trifle with me, Jack. I couldn't take it." 

I kissed her again, then sat up, buttoning my shirt. "You know it's true. Hell, I wouldn't know how to trifle with you. The only question now is what we do about it." 

She got on her knees, and wrapped her arms around my neck, leaning her forehead against mine. "We have an eternity to think about it. A whole week." I received a quick kiss. "We gotta go down there, or I'll never hear the end of it." 

I helped her to her feet, and followed her down the stairs. I don't know why I had said it. It was like I couldn't help myself. I was happy to get it out of the way. Now she knew, for better or worse. Only one thing bothered me. 

She hadn't said it back. 

* * * 

The House had been transformed. Nine months earlier, it had been a shambles, a hollow shell. A month ago, it had been rendered barely habitable. Now it was a home. 

The smells of the holiday filled the air. Dinner on the stove, the fire in the fireplace, the tree and its decorations. Outside, a light drizzle had started. My first thought was disappointment, it would have been nice to have a white Christmas. Then, as the falling rain damped the outside noises of the world, bringing a crispness to the air, amidst the faint patter of raindrops against the windows and porch, I realized how wonderful it was. How perfect. Our world, encapsulated on that hilltop, isolated by distance, the dark, and now the elements. 

I opened the front door wide, standing in the doorway, breathing deep of the clean air, embracing the cool wind carving around my body. Karen and Bev were still chatting. I don't know how women do it. Together for hours and hours every day, they can always find something new to talk about. The most common daily event was worth an hour long discussion. Their voices rising and falling, changing timbre, inflection, pace, alternating in ragged blocks, that was my Christmas music. No finer had ever been written. 

I don't know how long I stood there, staring out into the night, the cold air pressing against me, the heat of the interior against my back. The sound and smells of the inside and outside dueling around me, as I served as a human shield, keeping my home, my women, safe from the elements. 

A caress against my cheek. "You feel it, don't you, Mary? It's a home again." I said. "Was it like this for you?" 

"Jack! You're letting the cold in!" Karen called out to me. 

"And letting the heat out," Bev added. 

I closed the door, shivering momentarily. It was cold outside. I needed to get a thermometer, I imagine it was below 40. 

With a few quick steps, I reached Bev, enveloping her in my arms. I buried my face in her neck, hugging her. "Best Christmas ever," I told her. 

She laughed, ruffling my hair. "You're frozen! Warm up by the fire." 

I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and turned to the blazing wood, crackling comfortably. I held out my hands, letting the heat leech the cold from hands and arms. 

Sitting cross-legged on the floor, I looked around at my home. Once more seeing the decorative changes. The stockings above my head were no longer empty. The picture above the mantle, Mary's gift, was still wrapped. The tree a few paces away was floating amid a sea of brightly wrapped gifts. 

Karen settled in behind me, her arms wrapped around my waist, her legs outside mine. I felt her press against my back, her breath on my neck. "Happy?" she asked. 

"As happy as I could ever imagine." 

She kissed me just under the ear. "It shows." 

I held her arms, where they clutched me. "It's true you know. What I said." 

"What?" 

"I love you." 

"We barely know each other," she whispered. 

"True. I know it's too early. I told myself I wouldn't say anything. I didn't want to scare you away. I...I'm too intense sometimes, I understand that. Too focused. Single-minded. I'm sorry about that." 

Her lips caressed my neck from behind. "I like it. Determined, I'd call it. Persistent." 

I laughed. "Obstinate, stubborn, is what I was always told." 

Bev reminded us of her presence. "I think I'm ready to call it a night. It's been a long day." 

While Karen went through the bathroom, and bedtime preparations, I made sure the bedroom fires were healthy, and banked the living area ones, putting the lamps out, and locking up. 

I peeked in on Bev, giving her a hug and kiss goodnight, took Karen by the hand and led her to my bedroom. 

Mary left us alone for the most part. Unlike the crazy unbridled passion of the previous night, it was a night of slow easy loving. I didn't need Mary's help to get up for Karen a second time, and it was even more relaxed than the first one, with her laying on top of me, as I joined with her, holding and caressing her, accepting her kisses. 

I fell asleep with her in my arms, and barely woke when Mary gave me my middle- of-the-night treat. 

* * * 

What can I tell you about that first Christmas in The House? It was all I'd ever hoped a Christmas could be, in every way. The only thing missing was snow. 

I woke with Karen in my arms, and when she left to take care of Bev, getting her ready for the day, I gave Mary the first two of my Christmas presents for her. There's not a lot I could give her, but 30 minutes in the morning was a start. 

We had a light breakfast, and I could tell the women felt the same excitement I did. We make the 9:30 service in town, where we met many of our neighbors for the first time. We were minor celebrities, once people learned I was the one fixing up The House. I felt an almost overwhelming pride to be there with Karen and Bev, while they bragged on me and what I'd accomplished so far. I'm sure a lot of people were wondering what our relationship was, but nobody was gauche enough to ask, and we weren't offering. At least I wasn't. 

We were home before noon. Our first order of business was to get comfortable. It only took me a few minutes to change down to jeans and a t-shirt, and I had the fires roaring by the time the ladies appeared. I think they were as eager to get to the presents as I was, although I was a little nervous, and knew I'd catch a lot of grief for overdoing it. 

Bev was parked in front of the fire, with her ever-present tea. I was recruited to help with the dinner, and it was almost 1:00 pm before we were finally able to settle in and open the gifts. 

I was feeling a little guilty. After Karen passed out the presents, I had a pile in front of me, larger than both of theirs combined. "Way too much," I told them. "I thought we agreed to keep it sane." 

Bev pooh-poohed my complaint. "They're little things, and a lot are for the house, it's not a big deal, Jack." 

The smaller gifts went quickly, while I opened one for each they opened. Karen was expressive and appreciative for the small presents, a sweater, a gift certificate for a mani-pedi in town, a tree ornament, fuzzy slippers. Bev made a big deal out of hers, a tea cozy, a set of walkie-talkies, a silk scarf, a matching gift certificate to Karen's. 

They exchanged gifts with each other, and I got half a dozen items for The House, new shirts, sunglasses, all of them great gifts. The girls each had one big package remaining, the ones I'd given them. I had two in front of me, one small box, and one very large one. Before opening those, I told them I wanted to open one more. 

I went to the picture, and removed it from the wall. "A gift to The House," I explained, and unwrapped the touched up frame with new glass and the cleaned photo. The women both told me it looked great, and that we'd have to work on the other original items, to get them in shape. The hint of a kiss on my cheek, standing in front of the picture, was the 'thank you' I was happiest to receive at that moment. "Like it?" I asked. 

She knew who I was addressing. I got another quick kiss, and a tug on my right ear. 

I sat with the women, and they insisted I open the big present. It was from both of them. 

The box weighed a ton, and rattled when I shifted it. I tore through the paper like a big kid, and tore open the top. It took a few moments for me to realize what I was seeing. 

"How...where..." 

Karen laughed. "I saw there was a salvage auction. I was actually looking for something that would fit the house, maybe a 100 year old door, an old dresser, whatever. When I saw that come up, I knew you had to have it. It was a bit more than I could afford, so Bev was generous enough to help." 

I was pulling out the items, examining them. It was period hardware, at least a century old. Glass door knobs, brass handles, hinges, kick plates, keyhole covers, sash locks, large iron hinges, and many I had no idea what they were. There must have been over a hundred items in that box. Many didn't match, but I was surprised how many did. 

The women were laughing, when I finally realized how long I'd been looking through my box of goodies. I had a couple of dozen items spread out around me. "I guess I have my work cut out for me." 

"Do you like it?" Karen asked nervously. 

"It's incredible. Perfect. I can't believe it." I pushed the box to the side, and gave each of my women a big hug and kiss. "Best Christmas present I ever got. Even better than my first bike." 

Now I was nervous. The last two gifts were the shoebox sized disguised jewelry items, labeled 'OPEN LAST'. That, and the small box I had left. 

Karen picked hers up and shook it. I saw her grin. "Feels like a book." 

I did my best to hide my feelings. Excitement, nervousness, and that little bit of guilt. 

She was a woman. She carefully opened the paper, putting it to the side to be reused. I tore gifts open. She opened the box, and I saw the look of surprise when she found another wrapped gift inside. "Like a Russian nesting doll," she commented, setting the empty box to the side and unwrapping the second package. This was a little harder to disguise, it was an oversized ring box. She opened the lid and I heard her gasp. "Oh my God," she whispered, pulling it free and gazing at it. 

"Is...Is it real?" she asked, trying it on her finger. 

"I'm not sure what it is. It's old, we'll have to have is appraised." 

"It's fantastic. Gorgeous. But it's way too much, Jack. We agreed." 

"Like my box of goodies?" I reminded her. 

She extended her hand staring at the ring on her finger. It was old-fashioned. Not what young women wore any more. But there was no denying it was stunning. 

Karen turned to Bev. "Open yours Bev." 

Bev's hands were shaking. I didn't know if it was from the excitement, or something else. The interior box wasn't a surprise this time, and she pulled out the paperback sized interior gift. She unwrapped the second item, and took a moment before opening the felt covered jewelry box. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes a moment, and her trembling hands lifted the cover back on its hinge. 

She stared at it a moment, then turned to me. "Where did you find it, Jack?" 

I blushed. "During the renovations, I found a hideaway in one of the fireplaces upstairs. It was in there." 

"You don't know what it is, do you?" 

"I imagine it was Mary's." 

She gave me a mysterious look. "It was. You can't give me this. It belongs in a museum. I could never wear this." 

"It's a necklace, Bev. It was made to be worn. Nobody deserves it more than you. Hell, it's yours anyway. It was part of The House that you should never have given away." 

She removed it from the box gingerly. "Get the picture, Jack." 

I knew which one she was talking about. The family picture where Mary was wearing the necklace. I passed it to her. She pulled it close to her face, gazing on it. "I remember it. She wore it on her wedding day. It was her mothers, and her grandmothers before that. A family heirloom." 

"See. It should stay in the family." 

She shook her head. "What do you think the center stone is, Jack?" 

"I don't know. Topaz?" 

"It's a diamond, Sweetie. Back then it was one of the largest canary yellow diamonds in the world. Over 60 carats. The matching ring is nearly 20 carats. This isn't something you just give away. It would pay off all your repairs a dozen times over. Maybe more. When it was first bought, by Mary's grandfather, it cost over $20,000, in the 1880's. I shudder to think what it's worth today. Everyone thought it was lost forever." 

Her words surprised me. I knew it was pretty, but that was crazy. Who even knew diamonds came in yellow, and over 60 carats? I stood, and took it from her hands, removing it from the case. I opened the latch, stood behind her and placed in on her neck. "I want you to wear it. I know nobody else who could do it justice." I closed the clasp and kissed her on the cheek. "I love you, Mom. Please accept it. I know it's what Mary would want." 

Her fingers rose slowly to touch it, while the tears coursed down her weathered cheeks. "It's too much," she whispered. 

"Nothing's too much for you." 

Karen had come over and was kneeling before Bev's wheelchair. She placed her hand against Bev's chest, next to the necklace. "We can't split these up." 

I was ready for more argument, but Bev settled it. "Thank you, Jack. It's an incredible gift. We're both more than happy to accept your presents." 

Karen continued to argue. "They're a set. It's obvious. You should have both Bev." 

Bev smiled, and patted Karen's hand. "I'm certain they'll be a set again someday. Until then, I think it's appropriate we each wear one." 

Karen blushed, and gave Bev a hug. "Open your last gift, dear," Bev said to me. 

I tore open the paper, and found a folded envelope inside. "Don't say a word about it, Jack. Not one word, other than thank you." 

I opened the envelope and found an invoice for a paved road to The House. It was stamped 'Paid In Full', in red. I started to open my mouth, to tell her no way. She'd already given me the property. A $30 grand road was out of the question. 

"Not a word!" Bev snapped. 

"Seriously, Bev..." 

"If anything crosses your lips other than 'Thank You', I'm giving you the necklace back." 

I glanced over at Karen, and she was smirking. "You knew about this, didn't you?" I asked her. 

"Tell her thank you, Jack, or you're getting the ring back too." 

I closed the envelope, and went over to Bev for another kiss. "Thank you." 

She nodded, grinning. "That wasn't so hard, now, was it?" 

"You're a trouble maker, crazy woman." 

She laughed. "Like you have room to talk. Now let's clean up this mess. Monday, we need to get these appraised and insured." 

Karen prepared our dinner, and Bev watched over me as I sorted through my box of old toys. I wondered how much things had changed over the years, what kind of changes would have to be made to the doors to handle the older hardware, or if I'd need to replace them. I sorted the like ones into groups, looking for enough to keep the floors similar. They were obviously heavily used, and I wondered how I should clean them. 

I heard Bev's giggle. I looked up and she was smiling. "Like a big kid." 

"Better than a train set," I admitted. 

Things were off for a while, a little awkward. I wasn't sure why, but by dinner everything was back to normal. I was happy as any human could be, and I don't think I was alone. 

After dinner we played a little cards, talked about the party the next day, and called it a night early. I thanked them both for the best Christmas of my life. 

Karen thanked me in the bed an hour later, and a couple of hours after that, I thanked Mary in one of the few ways I could. 

* * * 

The 26th was a gorgeous day. According to my truck, it was about 60 degrees out, cool, but not uncomfortably so. Karen and Bev had me running around like a mad man getting everything ready for our guests. 

Andrew, his wife Brianna, and his two kids were the first to arrive. Brianna brought an apple pie that looked delicious, and they gave us a welcome mat as a housewarming gift. 

I accepted it warmly. "You know that officially The House isn't finished yet," I reminded him. 

"So I hear. I also hear it's damned close. Still looking forward to how you finish it." 

It seemed so different, kids running around, five adults wandering about, peeking into corners. 

My new favorite shopkeeper showed up in a full van. She stood outside, gazing up at the building, while I went out to join them. 

"Unbelievable," she said, and gave me a hug. She turned and waved her husband over. "Ron, this is...uh..." 

I laughed. "Jack. Please to meet you Ron. Now if you'd just introduce me to your wonderful wife, we can get the names out of the way." 

He chuckled, informing me his wife's name was Marge, and introduced me to the rest of his brood. Daughter Jean, her husband Drew, and their two kids. I escorted them into The House, did the rest of the introductions and mingled a bit. Before long I was giving everyone the tour of The House, listening with more than a little pride to their praise. 

Ron was the most inquisitive. I learned he'd done the repairs on his own century old home. "You did all this?" 

"I had help. Some of those beams are pretty heavy." 

Andrew laughed. "Don't believe a word of it. He did it all. Even the wiring and plumbing, I don't care whose signatures are on the work." 

"Where'd you get the wood? Mostly oak isn't it?" Ron asked. 

"Off the property. The majority came from clearing the road. The trees there were younger, most less than 60 years old, and a lot easier to work with." 

"The only place around where 60 year old trees are the new wood. You've done a hell of a job," Ron observed, running his hand over the wood paneling. 

I took the men on a tour of the hilltop, while the women chatted, gathered around Bev's location. The kids were running around checking everything out. I'd given them the run of The House. 

Ron's eldest, Dave, I'm guessing around 14-15 years old, came running over to us, while they were looking over the bench under The Oak. "Mom said to come back. Holly hurt her hand." 

We all hustled back, and I found out that Marge and Ron's granddaughter had her hand pinched when the third floor trapdoor closed on her. There were a lot of accusations among the kids over who'd closed it. I went up to check on the situation myself. The door was closed, and when I went to open it I was shocked by Mary's appearance. A firm tug on my left ear, a definite 'No.' 

"What happened?" I said out loud. The kids and parents were gathered at the foot of the stairs. A cacophony of answers came out of the kids, but the only answer that mattered was a whispered "...Danger..." 

"Who locked this?" I asked, looking behind me. The bolt holding the doors shut had been slid in place. It had been open when I gave the adults the initial tour. All I got was denials from all the kids. 

I opened the bolt that joined the twin panels, and felt a sharp tug on my left ear. I understood that Mary had strong feelings about the third floor. I opened the doors, and felt her hand on mine, pushing back. "...No..." she warned. 

As rarely as she spoke to me, and the effort I knew it cost her, the two consecutive phrases had me hesitating. Still, The House was my responsibility and I needed to check it out. Stepping into the wide open space, there was nothing out of place. The windows were boarded up, the fireplaces temporarily bricked off. The two light bulbs illuminating the space did a poor job of fighting off the shadows. The access to the attic was still closed. Nothing there to see. 

I turned to see Andrew peeking up through the opening. I stepped his way, and my bowels turned to water when I felt a firm push in my back. I would have blamed it on Mary, I recognized the type of touch, but Mary had made it clear in the last few weeks she wouldn't go past the last couple of stairs. No way she was up there with me. 2 

===

I stumbled into the stairwell opening, propelled by the shove. If I hadn't caught the edge of the door, I would have fallen through the opening, taking Andrew with me. As it was he caught me, teasing me for being clumsy. "Careful, Bub." 

"I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. It must have been an accident," I tried to explain, while pulling the doors shut above me. The door slammed shut, in spite of my trying to control its descent. My hands were shaking when I slid the bolt home. 

"Probably best to make that area off-limits," I said. "Nothing up there anyway." 

The brief bit of excitement was forgotten shortly after, when the kids hit the outdoors, once Karen had taken care of young Holly's pinched fingers. Nothing serious, thankfully. 

I tried to be a good host, but my mind was working overtime. Mary's warning, the accident, the firm push in my back, they all had me worrying. I had a bad feeling. 

Mary and I needed to talk. Not now, but soon. 

* * * 

Our little party was a hit, and as soon as our guests had departed, Karen put an exhausted Bev down for a short nap, while I started the cleanup. My nerves calmed a bit, but I still considered hunting Mary down for a private discussion. In the end, I decided to postpone it for the following day. I was going to spend a good part of the next few days working on the second floor and figured I'd have some privacy then. 

"They're nice people," Karen observed. 

"I know. I can't believe how lucky I've been so far." 

She chuckled. "It's not luck, Jack. Likes attract." 

I shrugged it off. I knew better. "Any interesting gossip?" I teased. 

"Girl talk. They're curious of course." 

"About?" 

She laughed. "About everything. If you're single. How we came to know each other. How long Bev and I are staying. What you do for a living. If you plan on living here, or selling the place when you're done. What kind of pie you like. The list goes on and on. I think you're going to be the topic of a lot of town conversations for a while." 

"That's all I need." 

"Get used to it. What did you expect, rebuilding the hilltop haunted house, and doing it almost in secret, by yourself?" She leaned in and gave me a hug. "I told them you had a Swiss-army knife, deluxe model." 

"Haunted house?" 

"Can you believe it? Marge and her daughter had a ton of scary old tales. Local legends. Ghostly images walking around the property. A Halloween haunted house party in the 50's that ended up with two injured kids. Children disappearing in the woods. They must have had half-a-dozen different stories to tell. Probably more." 

"I never heard anything about any of that." 

"You're not the most social guy in the world. Hell, you didn't even know the name of most of your guests. That's weird even for you," she teased. 

She was passing me the dishes to put away, as she went on. "These kinds of places always create stories, rumors, and suspicions. You're not getting spooked are you?" She raised her hands high, her fingers forming claws. "Ooooooh," she moaned, "I'm the ghost of Christmas future." 

"I don't think a sexy ghost like you would frighten many people off," I told her. 

"They did say that the building had burnt down before. That's kind of scary. According to Marge, it's cursed. Burnt down at least 3 times. Bev's uncle had to build it up almost from scratch like you did. Of course, nobody mentions how common it was for buildings to burn down back then. Chimney fires, everything made of wood, no fire alarms, and too far away for volunteer fire departments to do much good. Is it a surprise if there were a couple of fires over a span of 200 years?" 

That wasn't making me feel any better. Maybe I should invest in more fire alarms. Andrew had insisted I put in the minimum. 

I wasn't the best host that evening. We talked, and snacked on leftovers. Bev mentioned how popular her 'costume' jewelry was. The girls had a good laugh at that. I spent a few minutes on my phone, accessing the internet and found a certified gemologist in Richmond that would probably be able to appraise the jewelry. After some discussion, and more than a little push-back on my part, the women finally convinced me to let them take the truck down to get the jewels appraised and insured, while I got back to work on The House. 

At least it would give me some time to 'talk' with Mary. 

* * * 

Once they'd left in the morning, I retired to the bedroom undressing for some quality time with my favorite house 'haunter'. Mary wasn't long before making her appearance, and she was eager again, making my first a quick one. 

As she settled in for a more leisurely time, I spoke with her. "Can we talk about the third floor?" 

Her actions stopped, and then I felt the tentative tug on my right ear. 

"After, alright? Maybe while I'm working upstairs." 

I had another short tug, one of her wispy kisses, and then she was back working her magic, dealing with my rock hard erection. She took her time, riding me once again, until I couldn't resist her any longer. Not that I worked very hard at it. 

I spent the better part of the day working on the plumbing, one of my least favorite jobs. I was always concerned I was doing something wrong, and it took me twice as long as it should have. 

Mary was with me. I knew she was, and she reminded me with the occasional caress. At my first break, I took out one of my carpenter pencils, and marked up a board. "Don't Know", "Yes", "No", "Maybe", and a new answer "Other". 

"You don't like the third floor, do you?" I asked her. I knew the answer, but she rapidly moved the pencil tip to 'No'. 

"We're not alone here, are we?" I think she understood I wasn't talking about Karen and Bev. 

The pencil shifted, and I was a little surprised when it tilted upward and underlined the 'No'. 

Shit. There was a time when all of this would have seemed like so much nonsense. But there was no doubt in my mind that Mary was very real. Which opened up so very many possibilities. 

"Did...did they have anything to do with what happened to you?" 

The pencil shifted over and settled over 'Yes'. 

"More than one?" 

That answer was less definitive. The pencil shifted from 'Yes' to 'Maybe' and ended at 'Don't know'. 

"You think so, but you're not sure?" 

'Yes'. 

"They're dangerous, aren't they?" 

Another ambiguous answer. A firm 'Yes', the tip tapping on the answer, before it moved over to the 'Maybe' and finally 'No'. 

That had me talking out loud. "Yes dangerous, but no? Not always? Not everywhere? Maybe only up there, or on certain occasions. Crap. I wish I could... we could talk." 

Her concerned face appeared before me, and her lips moved. "...protect you..." she said, before fading away. 

That woke me up. Was she protecting me, us? How? Why? What kind of protection? Damn, this was getting weirder by the minute. 

"Are we safe on the first two floors?" I asked. 

I got a tug on my right ear, before the pencil move to 'Yes'. Then it hovered over 'Maybe'. 

I sighed. It was difficult to communicate with Mary. I wondered how hard it was for her. "I think I need a break, and time to think about this." I opened my pants and leaned back, inviting her attention. "Thank you for watching the kids, that could have been a mess, couldn't it?" 

I got a tug on the right ear, a quick kiss, and then I was no longer able to concentrate on anything but her attention. 

An hour or so later I receive a call from Bev. "Working hard?" she asked. 

Not as hard as I had been just a few minutes earlier. "Always. How are you guys doing?" 

"We're getting a lot of attention. The main appraiser here is excited. We're going to be at least a few more hours. Apparently records exist for our jewelry, and she's going to start out confirming them." 

"What's this going to cost?" I asked. I had no idea how much something like that would run. 

"It depends. How do you feel about publicity?" 

"What kind of publicity?" I asked. 

"If we only want an appraisal for insurance purposes, she says she can do both for under $500." 

"Five hundred dollars? To appraise jewelry?" 

"If we allow her to write it up, take credit for the appraisal, she'll do it for free. Apparently it's a big deal. A famous set of jewelry reappearing after 80 years." 

"I don't know, Bev. Isn't that dangerous?" 

"She says she'll keep our names and address out of it. I don't think it will be a problem. Once the item's existence is known, it would be hard for anyone to lay claim to it." 

"It's yours. If you don't mind, I guess I don't. Is she talking numbers yet?" 

"No. I mean, well, she hazarded one number, for the set, but I don't know if she's serious. She says that's what an auction might bring." 

"Auction? How much?" I asked. 

"Three million. She says that's a minimum. Do you understand now, Jack? This isn't something you just give away." 

I was unable to answer. Three million? I was thinking closer to a hundred thousand. It only cost $20K new. Hell, the diamond wasn't even clear. It was yellow. 

"Jack? You still there?" 

"Yeah. It's kind of hard to believe, you know." 

"I know. We'll have a better handle on it in a few hours. She's making a lot of calls. She wants to send pictures out. If you don't mind, I'm going to allow her." 

"Whatever you want to do, Bev. It's yours. Yours and Karen's. Just be careful, Ok? I get nervous thinking of you two driving around with more than a million dollars of jewelry." 

"We'll be careful. You do the same, alright?" 

"Of course. I'm always careful. Still have all my fingers and toes to prove it." 

"I'll call before we leave. Karen says you're on your own for lunch, and we'll probably pick up dinner on the way back." 

"Alright. Love you, take care." 

"Love you too, Sweetie. See you later." 

After a leftovers lunch, I had a short discussion with Mary. I didn't learn much more than the third floor was dangerous. She confirmed The House had burnt down before her husband Don had it fixed up. She had heard it had burned down more than once. She believed our third floor guests were responsible for the fires. 

She also seemed to believe if we stayed away from the third floor, we were probably safe. That was about as good as I could hope for. 

I wondered if all those crazy TV shows about Ghost Hunters, and such stuff had any validity to them. If there was somewhere I could go for help. Of course my main concern was exposing or endangering Mary. Damn it, one more thing I'd have to look into. But not so long as the women were there. 

I got a bug up my ass, and regretted not having the truck. I wanted to lock that trapdoor. Prevent any accidental contact. For the moment, I toe-nailed about a dozen nails into where the doors joined, a temporary but moderately effective lock. 

It was good to be with Mary. I loved my women, but hated that I couldn't make time for my spectral girlfriend while they were around. I did my best to restock her energy, until I was feeling the effect too much to continue. She recognized the impact on me, and when I made a fifth offer, she zipped my pants up, and gave me a nice long kiss. 

"Later then," I promised. 

I got another kiss, and a tug on my right ear. 

The women showed up at dusk. They were obviously worn out, but seemed pleased with their outing. They made me carry a couple of heavy boxes into The House. They'd obviously done more than wait idly for the appraisal results. Over a dinner of fried chicken and mashed potatoes I received both the good and bad news. 

Bev stared the conversation. "It's all official. The jewelry's the real deal. Apparently the set has a name, The Duchesses Daisies." 

"Jewelry has names now?" 

"Not normally. Only rare, important pieces. Nina wants us to consider a new name. The Lost Daisies." 

"This is too bizarre for words," I told her. "You get to rename the jewelry?" 

"It's going to be big news. The necklace stone is still among the half-dozen largest in the world, and one of the clearest. It's all a bit of a shock to me as well." 

Karen interrupted. "Even the ring is practically priceless. This is more than a little crazy, Jack. You don't know me well enough to be giving me a million dollar ring." 

I was still having a hard time working with the numbers they were talking. But I knew I didn't have a choice. The jewelry wasn't mine to give away. It was Mary's. And she'd made her decision. "I guess I'm going to have to get to know you better, then," I told Karen. 

Karen pulled out the papers. "It's not a joke. Tell him, Bev. Or I will." 

Bev looked nervous. "At least $4 million at auction, probably more like $6 million, with a possible high end of ten or so for the right buyer. That's for the set. Individually, the value goes down about 40%. Matching large yellow diamonds are impossibly rare." 

"You know how insane this sounds?" I told her. 

"It's a problem, Jack. We can't insure them," Bev explained. 

"Why not?" 

"Insurance would run around one percent of the value, and that's only with the right security. We're talking over $60,000 a year in payments." 

"You're kidding," I blurted. 

"Hardly. There's really only two things we can do," Bev said. 

"And those are?" 

"Either we keep them totally secret, never wear them, never let their existence be known, or we let the whole world know about them, which would make it impossible for them to show up on the market. We'd still have to keep them locked up at the bank when we're not wearing them." 

I had to laugh. "What a mess. I just wanted to give you something nice." 

Bev reached out and held my hand. "It's more than nice, Jack. It's incredible, and just like you. It's my family's heritage, and you have no idea what this means to me. We just have to figure out what to do about it." 

I nodded. "For now, I think it's best if it goes back into its original hiding place. That worked for almost a century." 

Of course, they wanted to know more about that. After dinner, I ended up carrying Bev up the stairs, with Karen following, dragging long a chair. Once I had them in front of the fireplace, I pulled up the stone that covered the secret hideaway. 

We put their jewelry back in the cases, and lowered it into the hole, covering it up again. I put the log rack over it, hiding its existence. 

"How did you ever find that?" Bev asked. 

Good question. "Just cleaning. I...uh...was washing the stones down, and the water kept leaking away. I thought it might need repairs. I had no idea it was a secret vault." I felt a little guilty lying to them. This guilt thing was starting to get to me. 

* * * 

I think we all felt better, once the jewelry was in a safety deposit box at the bank. While we were out, I was able to pick up a few things I needed at the hardware store, before we returned home. 

The rest of the week was all I could hope for. I'd almost forgotten to get Bev's commitment, but Tuesday at breakfast I had a little note at my table place. 

Upstairs. 

I laughed, and promised I'd get right on it. 

We'd eat our meals together. I'd work from breakfast until dinner on my projects, occasionally with Karen assisting, but mostly they had their own projects they were working on. Tuesday afternoon, I was surprised to hear a sewing machine running downstairs. I learned I was going to be getting drapes. Of course it was my job to hang them. The women ran errands without my even knowing about it. I just kept plugging away at the second floor, my only company Mary, most of the time. 

It did give me the opportunity to spend a lot of quality time with Mary, and keeping her needs met. A couple of nights, when she was feeling ornery, she'd get involved in my session with Karen. Those were quite exhausting, and Karen warned me after the third one, that I'd have to keep the craziness down to no more than twice a week, or she'd never get anything done. We got a lot of ribbing from Bev the following mornings. 

I was informed we were going to a New Year's Party in town. Marge had insisted, and the women seemed eager to attend. That meant I lost them for the whole day Friday, while they went shopping and got prettified. 

It was worth it. Bev was elegance personified, and her necklace had been cleaned and shone like the sun from her chest. Looking at her, I could only imagine how beautiful she must have been in her youth. "Don't let any of those young men run off with you, gorgeous. I'll bet you're the best looking woman at the ball." 

She laughed. "I'll take that bet. Karen cleans up nice." 

Holy shit, did she ever! I'd never seen her in anything but casual wear, mostly jeans and oversized shirts. I knew her body was fabulous, but I wasn't expected the vision of loveliness that exited my room around 9:00 PM. I was struck dumb. 

She posed for me, then I saw the nervous look on her face. "You don't like it?" 

That broke me out of my trance. "My God, woman, are you insane? I love it! You're gorgeous!" 

A huge grin broke out across her face. "Not too much?" 

A little too much cleavage, a bit too much leg, a tad too tight, all too incredible for words. "I don't dare leave your side all night. I'll lose you for sure." 

She walked forward on her almost non-existent three inch heels. "Silly man. No way you're ever going to lose me. You'd have to throw me away." 

The only item of jewelry she was wearing was her ring. I felt odd for a moment. Like the items should be worn together, but there was no way I was going to suggest that. Instead I asked for a moment. 

I went to my room, and called out for Mary. I felt her touch. "Would it be Ok for Karen to wear your pearls for the party tonight?" I asked as I opened up the box. There had been a worn suede bag inside of it containing a pearl necklace. I had realized at the time that Mary had been around during the flapper era. I wondered how often she had worn it. 

I received a tug on my right ear, and she ruffled my hair. That usually meant that she was happy with me, so I didn't worry about it. "Gimme a kiss, beautiful," I said softly. "I wish you could go with us. Maybe next year we'll hold New Year's here." 

I got my kiss, and returned to the women. I held up the pearl strands. "Will this go with your outfit?" 

Bev laughed. "Pearls go with everything, dear man." 

They were longer than I expected. I was used to more of a choker style, but these hung down almost to her waist. Bev called Karen over. She had her lean over, and tied a knot in the strand, about halfway down her cleavage. "Mary's?" she asked. 

"Yeah, she said it's Ok," I added without thinking. 

Bev looked up at me, and I realized what I said. "I mean, I'm sure she wouldn't mind." 

Karen stood back and posed for us. "How does it look?" she asked. 

"You're stunning," I told her. 

She smiled, blushing. "I already know your opinion. I mean the pearls." 

"Perfect." 

Bev didn't think so, and adjusted the knot upward a bit. "Be careful with these. We'll want to get them restrung as soon as possible. Silk lasts a long time, but not forever." 

I felt like a goofball, wearing a plain suit, with these women dressed up as they were. "Remind me next year to rent a tux. I look like a homeless guy next to you two." 

Bev took my hand, chuckling. "That's how it's supposed to be, Sweetie. You're never supposed to look better than your women. I know it's hard for you to tone it down, but I think we'll be fine for tonight." 

"I feel almost as foolish driving you ladies in a truck. You deserve a stretch limo." 

Karen slid her arm in mine. "Not on your driveway. Maybe next year." 

That sounded like a plan to me. 

* * * 

We were a hit. At least the women were, always surrounded by admirers. I had to fight my way through the crowd a couple of times. I would have been more nervous, if there weren't as many women around them as men. 

The party was at the local VFW. I learned it was the biggest hall in town, other than the high-school gym. They had it fixed up nice, and even had a local band. $50 a couple bought your entrance and a bottle of champagne. Our table of eight contained Marge and Ron, as well as two other couples. It was a little crowded squeezing Bev in, but nobody seemed to mind. We were royalty. We were sitting with both the Mayor and his wife, as well as the high school principal and her husband. 3 

===

I learned that Sarah, the principal, had a doctorate in history, specializing in the Civil War. She was utterly fascinated with The House, and had stories to tell. According to her, it had served as a Civil War makeshift hospital. It had been burned to the ground, and more than a dozen people were supposed to have perished in it. It wasn't making me feel any better. 

"Never heard of a place with such bad luck. Burned down in 1863 after the battle of Fredericksburg. You know more than 3500 men perished that winter in Stafford County alone. After an aborted attempt to rebuild it around 1870, it wasn't until 1878 that it was rebuilt and lost again around 1920. Then again in 1929. Such a shame, it's such a beautiful building." She was staring into her drink as she spoke, then abruptly looked up at me. "I...I'm sure it was just bad luck. Times have changed. I'm certain you won't have any issues like that. I think we're all counting on seeing the mansion on the hill, with all four chimneys belching smoke for many years to come." 

"I hear it's supposed to be haunted," I mentioned casually. 

She looked at me with amusement. "There are always rumors about old dilapidated buildings. As you can imagine, four fires make for good rumor fodder." 

"Four? I thought you said three?" 

"Three while it was inhabited. The first rebuild ended with a fire. The owners gave up after a series of issues. Seems like they didn't quite have your perseverance." 

She went back to playing with her drink. "Besides, I think we're a little more civilized now. Surely you don't believe in haunted houses." 

"Of course not. This is the 21st century," I assured her, lying through my teeth. 

"I hope I'm not too presumptuous, but I'd love to see what you've done with the place sometime." 

"I'm still working on it. I'm hoping to finish getting it fully habitable by the spring. I'd love to have you visit then." 

I had a better time than I thought I would. I danced with Karen several times, but we spent far more time getting to know our neighbors than we did dancing. Bev had no shortage of admirers, and she had them eating out of her hand. She had the pedigree, of course, with family in the area for many years. I was even chatted up by a few single women, but with Karen and Bev giving me the stink- eye any time one of them hung out for any length of time, I was playing it as safe as possible. Still, it was good for the ego. I did manage to get one dance each with the ladies at our table. 

At midnight I claimed my New Years kiss, from each of my women, and was surprised to receive several more. Not as many as Karen, who had far fewer than Bev. No doubt Beverly was a big hit, and basking in the attention. 

Shortly after midnight, I was able to pry my women free from their admirers, and as I drove them home, I wondered if I'd ever have a year better than that one. I doubted it. 

* * * 

The weekend was quiet. We all slept in Saturday, and I took Karen for a walk down to our favorite spot by the Lover's Beech, as we'd come to call it. "I hate for you to go," I told her. 

"I hate to leave. But I have a job. We've got to get Bev back anyway, and start working out the details to get her moved out here." 

"Are you going to be able to come with her?" I asked. 

She stopped walking, moments before reaching our clearing. "Are you asking?" 

Shit. I'd never even brought it up. It was all about Bev. I don't know what I'd been thinking. 

"Karen, I'm going to be asking for your patience a lot. I'm an asocial fool, who doesn't know how to behave around women. I hope you know how much I want you here. I guess I just assumed, which in retrospect is idiotic." 

She smiled, and slipped into my arms. "I can be patient. But I need to hear it. Ask me, Jack." 

"Karen, I...you know I love you. I can't imagine my life without you. I've never known happiness, true happiness, until I met you and Bev. I want you here, with me." 

She hugged me tight. "Can I consider my ring an engagement ring?" 

I hugged her tightly. "You know I'm an idiot, don't you?" 

She nodded. "Pretty much. But I love my big handsome idiot." 

"Come back to me. I'll get you a real engagement ring. One you can wear all the time." 

"That's a suck-ass proposal, idiot," I could feel her chuckling. 

"Damn it, Karen. I know I suck at this. I love you. I'd love for you to be my wife, the mother of my children. Will you return to me and marry me?" 

"Kiss me, darling idiot of mine. One kiss, and I'll be yours forever." 

I kissed her in the shade of The Beech, only a few feet from where Don and immortalized his love for Mary. 

When we broke apart, she had tears in her eyes. "I shouldn't tease you. But it was that or break down crying. Of course I'll marry you. It would take a crate of dynamite to blast me away from your side." 

I kissed her again, and my hands wandered down her back, to cup her delicious ass. She giggled. "It's too cold out for a repeat of last time. Take me home Jack. Take me home and let me love you." 

We walked back hand-in-hand. "I never expected any of this, you know," she said softly. 

"No kidding. All I wanted to do was fix up an old house." 

We laughed, swinging our arms like kids. "Elizabeth Taylor would be eating her heart out. My ring is better than hers." 

"What ring?" 

"God, how do you even survive on your own, Jack? The Richard Burton ring. The Elizabeth Taylor Diamond. Everyone knows that. She wore it almost every day. It's bigger than mine, but it's white, common. Mine's yellow." 

"Yellow is better?" 

She laughed. "Hell yeah. It's all the rage. Less than 0.1% of diamonds are yellow. Large ones are almost never found. Mine's a keeper." She slowed down a bit. "Hey, if Liz could wear hers every day, why can't I wear mine?" 

"Hell if I know. Would it stand up to daily wear? Is it built for that? Wouldn't you worry about losing it? It's so big, won't it get in the way?" 

"Don't bother me with facts right now, Jack. Let me fantasize." 

"That's only fair I guess. I'm already living my fantasy." 

She gave my hand a squeeze. "Keep it up, big guy, and by the time I get done with you, there won't be anything left to fantasize about." 

Back at The House, real-life interrupted any immediate opportunity for fantasy fulfillment. Bev needed help, and after that, it seemed like we were constantly busy, preparing for their departure the next day. 

I caught the two women huddling together before dinner, and I was on the receiving end of a lot of furtive glances. Bev sat with me around the fire while Karen put the finishing touches on our evening meal. She didn't look my way as she spoke, her words soft and careful. 

"It's very sudden, Jack. Don't get me wrong, I love her to death, but everything's happening so fast." 

"I know. Don't you think I know, Bev? I wasn't going to say anything. I swear. I just couldn't help myself. My life seems to be hurtling down a tunnel, out of control. The thing is, the more I let go, the better it gets. She's the one for me. I know it." 

"Be careful, that's all. Don't hurt each other. It would break my heart to lose either one of you." 

"I'll do my best, I promise. You'll help, right?" 

She looked over and gave me a grin. "I'll see what I can do. You have to admit, it's one heck of an engagement ring." 

"It is, isn't it?" 

* * * 

That night with Karen was different. We joined quietly, intensely, then again, more passionately. We didn't speak much. I believe we were both feeling a bit melancholy, having to separate again. 

Afterward we lay together, holding each other. "As fast as you can, Ok?" I told her softly. 

"Don't forget me," she whispered. "You're going to have half the county chasing after you now. Don't let them catch you, Jack." 

I gave her a quiet hug. "Not a chance. I don't know how much you believe in destiny and fate, but for the last year or so, it seems like my life is almost out of my hands. Things happen, and for a reason. Like Bev bringing you to me. It's meant to be, babe. Nothing can change that." 

"I'll do what I can," she said. "I'm going to need some help from you. It's going to seem like I'm nagging you sometimes." 

"I understand. Whatever it takes to get your cute little butt back here." 

She giggled. "Little butt? I think you know better by now." 

"Alright, cute perfect butt." 

"I love you, Jack. I think I have since that first day here. You seemed so out of reach, I still can't believe it. Don't pinch me if I'm dreaming." 

She squealed when I pinched her bottom. "It's not a dream." 

"It is. Dream come true. Never wake me." 

"Alright. We'll never wake each other, deal?" 

"It's a deal." 

* * * 

The morning was a farce. We all pretended to be in good moods, but you could feel it in the air. Nobody wanted things to change, but we all had things to do before our lives could mesh fully. After breakfast I loaded up the truck, fighting back the tears. I'd had one perfect week. Now it back to being alone again. 

We were quiet on the drive to the airport. We chatted a bit, but there was none of the open gaiety we'd shared on their arrival. 

I watched them through security. I stood beside the cordoned off snaking line of travelers, waving, hoping they'd look back and see me. I smiled for them, standing on tiptoe when they looked my way and waved back. They had the same forced smiles. Hide the pain. It was as if I'd lost part of my heart, when they turned the corner out of view. 

I sat in the truck until I could see again. I never thought it would be that difficult. Never thought I could feel that deeply about anything. I was wrong. 

I took a few last deep breaths, and headed home. I had a lot to do, and only a couple of months to do it. 

* * * 

Mary was my solace, and I found myself depending on her more and more. Any outsider would have chalked me up as a crazy man, the way I talked to her all the time. 

For the next couple of months, I was working like a fiend. I put in my hours at work, managing to do a good enough job not to garner too much attention, good or bad, but I'd lost my heart for the work. My mind was always turning to The House, and my absent women. 

I was tired of working on a shoe string budget, and took Andrew's advice. The bank had no problem with issuing me a construction loan, with the parcel of the land on the far side of our creek as collateral. With $80K in the bank, I stopped doing the work piecemeal. I called in Charlie to finish the plumbing, and hired some help to install the windows. 

I was a little wary of the last, since almost all the windows were on the third floor. It seemed as if my concerns about any 'guests' up there were unfounded. It only took two days, and about five grand to get the job done, while I was at work. 

The lift was another $18K, and that was after I'd done most of the prep work myself. I had to admit the small elevator was gorgeous, especially once I'd finished paneling the inside with my wood. My concern about the third floor issues was raised once more, when one of the contractors had an accident, falling into the elevator shaft. Luckily, he only fell as far as the roof of the elevator, and there was no serious injury. The company was bonded and insured, and I was off the hook as far as any liability was concerned. After that I was determined not to use any unlicensed help, at least not where the third floor was concerned. 

My daily calls with the women were becoming marathons. We talked for hours, and it was the only thing keeping my mood elevated many days. The calls, and sweet Mary. 

It was three weeks after they left, when a pounding at the front door interrupted my Saturday breakfast. I was eating late, after spending an intense morning with Mary. Our extended time for each other was paying dividends, and she was showing herself more often. That morning, during our second play session, she'd ridden me with a passion, her angelic face visible to me nearly the entire time. 

I answered the door, and found Marge and Ron standing there. 

"Hope we're not interrupting?" Marge said. 

"Of course not. Now I feel like a jerk for not calling sooner. Come in!" 

The both glanced around. Ron spoke first. "We heard that Bev and Karen left." 

I nodded. "Temporarily. The House still isn't complete. I hope to have them back by March at the latest. It should be permanent then." 

Marge grinned. "That's great news. Beverly's a hoot. She left a lot of broken hearts after that New Year's party." 

I offered them drinks, but they had other things on their mind. "I found a few more items for the house. Sorry it took so long. Want to help us get them out of the van?" Marge said. 

I was eager to, and joined them outside. It was a cold January morning, my breath clearly visible, the frozen grass crinkling under foot. There were two large boxes in the van, and a dresser. It had seen better days. 

"These weren't with the others. They all need significant repair," Marge explained. "I keep those in the shed at home. That's why I couldn't find them." 

"No excuses necessary. You have to know how excited I am to have any of the original furnishings. I insist you allow me to pay you for them this time. I can't have you bankrupting your business." 

She flushed, closing the door behind her. "They're not all that valuable in the state they're in. Although I'll admit, one of them could be with a little love and care." 

I was opening the boxes. The first one made her words quite clear. There was a crystal chandelier in the box. Many of the crystals were loose on the bottom, and two of the arms were bent. The wiring coming out of the top was a mess. I had no doubt that when it was restored it would be stunning. 

"I take it you're referring to this?" I asked. 

She nodded. "It's the best, by far. I'm sure it'll be gorgeous when you're done with it." 

"Be honest with me, Marge. What is this stuff worth?" 

She seemed hesitant, which I thought was odd for somebody who I'm sure dickered about prices all the time. "Fully restored, probably 3 or 4 thousand. Not even a third that in its current condition. I know a few of the crystals are missing, and they're going to be a pain to replace." 

"And the rest of it?" 

"Not much. Not half of what the chandelier is worth." 

Ron was keeping out of it, trying to organize the parts of the dresser. 

"Two thousand, for all of it?" I asked. 

She shook her head, "I was thinking more along the lines of $1200." 

I chuckled. "We're being honest now, right? What could you get for it in the store?" 

She gave me a smile. "I am being honest, Jack. In its current condition, $1500 would be a reach." 

"And after the repairs?" 

She was slow to answer. "Maybe 4 grand. But I'd have to put more than a thousand dollars into it, in order to get that." 

"Maybe we can work something out," I offered. "Come up to the second floor for a minute." 

They followed up the stairs, and I showed them where I had the antique hardware spread out. "I'm going to have a third of this left over when I'm done. How about I pay you $1800, and whatever's left. Can you use this stuff?" 

She was inspecting the various pieces. "They'll sell like hotcakes. Everyone needs them, they're relatively inexpensive, and they show well. I think we have a deal." She picked up a pair of ornate drawer pulls. "Where'd you find this?" 

"It was my Christmas present from Karen. She says she found it at a salvage auction." 

She nodded. "More than one auction, I'd hazard a guess. Many of these are from different periods. At least 3 or 4 different homes. Must have cost a pretty penny." 

"I wouldn't know. They refuse to share that kind of information." 

Ron had given up on the chest. "So, how can I help today? Marge has got to open the store, but I'm open. Put me to work." 

A week later, I was hanging the chandelier in the dining room, and I thought Mary was going to go crazy, she was so happy. Like all good relationships, when Mary was happy, I was happy. She made sure of that. 

Ron became a weekend regular, and by mid February, we had two of his friends chipping in on occasion. Having the extra sets of hands came in handy, and the second floor started to take shape. Bathroom work was where I was weakest, but with their help, it all came together, faster and better than I could have ever managed on my own. 

I learned they all owned old homes they'd restored. Their combined experience was invaluable. They helped change the rooms downstairs back to their original purpose. A lot of the finer finish work got completed, hardware was installed, and the last week of February, Ron showed up at my door, grinning from ear to ear. "You owe me $975." 

I looked at him in surprise. It was the first time he'd talked about charging me for his help. He reached to the side of the entrance, and pulled a door out for me to see. 

It was nothing short of incredible. Sturdy, massive, it had old stained glass work about head high. It would be ideal for the entrance. He nodded toward the other side of the entrance, and I saw its mate. "No way that cost less than a thousand," I told him. 

"Marge found it at one of her auctions. She swears it's worth at least three, but that's the great thing about auctions isn't it? Only took a couple of evenings to get it in shape. So what do you think?" 

"I think it's perfect. I don't know what to say." 

He laughed. "Say you're going to write me a check, and let's see what it's going to take to get these installed." 

It wasn't a perfect fit, but close enough that we could get them hung in a day. A long day, with Marge bringing us dinner, but once we were done, it was worth every moment of the effort. 

"It's really starting to come around, isn't it?" Marge observed. 

"To say the least." 

"The new drive is quite the improvement. I hate to think what that must have cost." 

The paving team had spent two full weeks getting the road put in. They had worked with me, doing what they needed when I was in the office, working from 8 to 6 most days. What used to take 15 minutes to get from the road to The House, now took less than 5. I never realized what a change that would be. I found myself a lot more willing to run out for anything I needed, with the trip duration cut in half. 

Andrew made regular appearances, and I think he was as happy as I was, when he did the final sign-off the last week of February. "I never thought you'd be able to finish things this quickly," he admitted. 

"I couldn't alone, but I've had a lot of help the last few weeks. The loan gave me the funds I needed. I don't think I would have been done before the end of summer otherwise." 

I shook his hand and we shared a couple of beers, reminiscing over the changes. "What are you going to do next?" he asked. 

"There's still a ton of work to do. Lots of little jobs I've skipped over. There's the ice-house out back which I'd like to do something with. I still need to get electricity run up here. Once spring is here, there's a lot I'd like to do with the property. Getting rid of that ugly old trailer is pretty high on the list. Trust me, my work is far from done." 

"I'm glad I was a part of it. Most fun I've ever had while working." 

"Don't think I don't know how much you've helped. Without your guidance and greasing the skids, I don't think I could have finished in two years. I appreciate it more than I can say. I hope we can remain friends." 

"Me too. Brianna still can't stop talking about your Christmas party." 

"You guys will have to come out once the girls are back. I expect they'll want to hold an open house once the weather breaks." 

"Love to. Brianna would kill me if I turned it down. If there's anything else I can do for you, ever, you let me know." 

"Same here. I owe you. I hope you'll give me a chance to pay you back sometime." 

"You owe me nothing. It was a treat working with you. I've got bragging rights in the office. No, we're even." 4 

===

The women informed me they'd be ready by mid-March. It had taken longer than I'd hoped, and I still knew I'd be rushing like crazy to pull things together. Now it was a matter of outfitting the rooms, getting Bev's bathroom in shape, and making the place presentable. I'd been lax with the day-to-day upkeep. That would have to change. 

As much as I hated working on the third floor, there was more I wanted to do there as well. I kept putting it off, finding a reason to do anything else. I had run out of excuses. 

* * * 

Mary wasn't happy with me. Every time I headed up those last stairs, she'd interfere. I was having none of it. 

"Mary, I'll be careful. We're running out of time before Bev and Karen get here," I explained while carrying my gear upstairs. "Nothing dangerous, I promise." 

I hated the trapdoor. It destroyed the appearance of the second floor. I had decided to enclose the top of the stairwell, and add a heavy duty door, which locked with a standard key. It meant some framing and paneling, as well as installing the doorframe. It was going to be as solid as I could manage. 

I could feel Mary's unease, a palpable concern. She hung out at the bottom of the stairs, and always was waiting there when I came back down. For her sake, I did all the cutting and trimming on the second floor. It took me about half again as long that way, but I knew it helped her. 

I'll admit it. I felt uneasy up there. I don't know if I was becoming sensitized to a presence such as Mary's, but there were times I could feel a malevolence about me. On those occasions I simply put my gear down and returned to the second floor. It was usually a good excuse to provide for Mary's needs, and my own, if I'm brutally honest. About the third or fourth time she figured it out. 

"...you know..." 

"I do. I can feel when they're unhappy. Most of the time it's not bad. When I sense whatever it is, I leave. Give them some space. Alright?" 

Her fingers brushed my face, her lips descended on mine. I felt the familiar tug on my right ear. 

I grew a little complacent then. Less wary. Now that I could feel them, I was less fearful. I could go up to the third floor, and the moment it started to get bad, I headed down the stairs. 

The rest of The House was as ready as it was going to get, before the women arrived in less than a week. The last thing I wanted was for Karen or Bev to go up there, so I was determined to do whatever was needed before they arrived. 

There wasn't a lot required. I needed to close in the area above the elevator, for safety's sake. I wanted to put in a rough floor on top of the existing underlayment, thick enough to provide another level of insulation. Since I didn't plan on anyone being up there, the insulation was a big deal, I wanted to stop as little heat loss through the third floor as possible. This meant interior shutters on the windows, which added another level of safety, and sealing off the fireplaces. It also meant going up to the attic, and adding as much insulation as possible. 

It went surprisingly smoothly, and I let my guard down. I rarely felt the unwanted presence, and reacted to it quickly when I did. There were no incidents. 

Until I walled in the fireplaces. The west facing ones weren't an issue. I wasn't doing a fancy job. It wasn't the cheapest thing in the world but for about a hundred bucks, I could build a wall of fire bricks closing off the fireplace, backing them with a wall of tinder blocks. It only took a couple of hours each. I hoped to get all four done in a day. 

It was the front fireplace on the east wall where the trouble started. I had no warning at all. I stacked the bricks to the side, brought up my mortar, and as soon as I had the first row in place, I felt it. The hair on my arms stood on end, my entire body tingled, and then I was rolling across the floor, the bricks flying my way. I scrambled as quickly as I could for the stairwell, diving through it. I felt a thud as one of the bricks impacted the wall behind me, and then I was stumbling down the stairs as rapidly as I could, gasping. 

I felt Mary rush past me, and the door at the top of the stairs slammed shut. The bolt slammed in place, and she was with me, touching me, checking me, soft kisses landing on my face. 

Someone up there didn't like me. That much was obvious. 

* * * 

I'm not a quitter. I'm stubborn. Some would say obstinate. I let things settle down for a couple of hours, and returned upstairs. Mary tried to discourage me, but like I said, stubborn. I wasn't up there for more than a minute or two before I felt it. The anger, the hate, the evil, directed my way. I retreated to the stairwell, and closed the door behind me. Maybe now wasn't a good time. 

I relaxed for a minute, trying to calm Mary by making myself available to her. I think she was pissed, because she ignored me. 

So I planned. Looked for an alternate solution. I came up with what I thought might be a simple yet elegant one. Once things had calmed upstairs, I'd return with a pre-built wall which I could simply slip in place. Forget the bricks. I'd place a steel plate over the fireplace, and brace it with steel rods I could anchor it to the floor. The whole thing wouldn't take more than a minute tops. The only real question was if both fireplaces on the east side needed this kind of treatment, or just the front one. For simplicity's sake, I decided to prepare for both. 

I took the measurements of the fireplace opening on the second floor, since the second and third floors seemed to be the same dimensions. With the list in hand, I said goodbye to Mary, and made for the hardware store. 

Alright, I know nothing about buying steel. I discussed my idea and it was suggested that I buy 1/8 inch diamond plate aluminum, and back it with drywall, then a plywood panel. It seemed more complex than a simple steel plate, but the weight difference was a big factor, and I didn't have to worry about welding. I went home with the materials, and worked late into the night, building my fire breaks. 

The next morning I checked upstairs. Calm again. I carefully made my way toward the fireplace I hadn't approached the day before. I got within a couple of feet and waited. Nothing. 

I carefully cleaned up the mess from the previous day's fiasco. I stacked the bricks in front of the rear fireplace and retreated to mix some mortar. An hour later, three of the fireplaces were now blocked off, with only the southeast corner one still open. 

Downstairs, I was gathering up my instant wall, talking to Mary as I did so. "It should only take a few seconds," I explained. "I think I can get everything pretty close, then slam it up against the firewall and wedge it in place in about 10 seconds. Two or three good hammer blows should anchor the braces. If anything gets rough I'll get out of there as quick as I can, I promise." 

A painful tug on my left ear told me her opinion. 

"I have to do this, Mary. The issues are fires, right? The bad guys are on the third floor. Where do you think the fires come from?" 

Of course she didn't answer. She so very rarely did. 

"I bet they come out of the fireplace somehow. Maybe an ember from a fire on a lower floor. Perhaps one that gets out of hand up there. I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances. I think if we can seal off those fireplaces, we'll be a lot safer." 

I lugged the gear up the stairs, and put it on the top landing. I braced myself, my heartbeat starting to accelerate. Mary appeared before me, her face concerned. She leaned in and her lips caressed mine. 

"...careful..." 

"I'll try. I swear. I don't want to lose all the wonderful things that have come into my life, but I'm not going to let whatever it is up here ruin my life." 

She stayed visible, and moved out of my way. As soon as I opened the door to the third floor she disappeared. I understood. As scared as I was, I could only imagine how terrified she must be. Whatever it is had destroyed her life. 

Those thoughts energized me, fueling my own anger. I moved the gear within about 6 feet. The braces where already attached to the blocking sheet. The two four inch nails had been started at the foot of each brace. My hammer was ready on my belt loop. 

I could feel the sweat dripping down my neck, cool behind my ears. My hands were already starting to shake. For a moment I imagined Mary, leaping out that window, rather than face a burning death. I picture her baby in her arms. 

"Fuck this," I growled. I picked up my contraption and slammed it up against the opening. I braced my back against it, my hammer already in my hand, and with a hard blow, I drove the first nail into the floor. 

I felt it, the tangible evil, making the hair on the back of my neck rise. I drove the second nail into the ground, with two rapid blows, and turned to the other brace. 

It was horrible, I could feel it, smell it, taste it, enveloping me. I drove the hammer down and before the second attempt, my eyes were tearing, throat scalding. Disgust raged through my body. I continued hammering downward, blindly, feeling the occasional true impact. 

The miasma of malevolence frightened me, beyond anything I could imagine. I dropped the hammer, trying to crawl away. I was hit from the side, rolling over before scrambling forward again. I felt myself grabbed from my legs, pulled backward. I fought, kicked, clawed at the floor boards, the door opening only a scant few feet away. I rolled on my own, kicking backward, impacting nothing, while losing a couple of more feet. 

I screamed my frustration, anger at the unfairness, while the adrenalin coursed through my veins. Kicking out as fast as I could, scissoring my legs, I struggled forward a couple of more feet. I felt it then, that same foreboding, enveloping evil. It wouldn't let me go. Not this time. 

I looked at the open doorway, only a couple feet away. Something I could grab onto. A grip to cling to. A possible escape. My struggles could get me no closer. 

Mary had been right. I was foolish to try. My stubbornness was my own demise. I thought of Karen, Bev. Only a couple of days away. I'd failed them as well. Failed everyone. My fingers scrabbled at the floorboards, leaving bloody trails where my nails had broken free. 

They might get me, but I wouldn't surrender. Never surrender. Never, ever, surrender. My struggles continued uselessly, and inch by inch I slowly lost ground. I raised my eyes, toward that impossibly distant refuge, maybe a yard away. 

There she was, watching. Visible, the fear contorting that beautiful face. 

"I'm sorry," I told her as my strength failed me. "Sorry..." 

I slipped a few more inches away, and knew that at least I'd tried. I blinked back the tears, and felt something hit my head. Again. I looked up, and saw a field of tools in front of me, more appearing out of the doorway. I grabbed a screwdriver, sliding backward several inches when I lifted my hand. I drove the blade into the floor with all my strength, grabbed near the bottom and pulled. I regained the inches I'd lost. A breaker bar was near, to my left. I desperately clutched at it, lifted it high, and drove the hooked end into the boards. With two anchors, I made quicker progress, moving forward several more inches. 

I was abruptly released, and collapsed from exhaustion. It was very nearly my demise. Looking into the doorway, Mary was waving at me. I felt the agonizing blow in my side, and looked down to see my hammer claw driven into my flesh. I screamed out, and swung my breaker bar against the hammer handle, tearing it free, my flesh with it. I bit through my lip, fighting the pain, as I scrambled forward, feeling Mary's pull, falling through the doorway and down the stairs. 

The door above me slammed shut, and I heard the rain of implements pounding at the door from the other side. Then Mary was with me. Sweet Mary. My unlikely savior. 

* * * 

Eighteen stitches for the jagged wound in my side repaired the worst damage. Bandages over my fingertips, a few more stitches in my lip, and a warning to be more careful was the extent of it. I was released from the emergency room that same night. 

I slept at home in my bed, on the second floor. Or at least I tried to. I was too close to the evil. I could sense it above me. The Master bedroom fireplace shared the same chimney as the evil one above. After an hour of restlessness, I moved down to the first floor, and collapsed on the couch. 

Gasping in terror, I awoke to Mary's touch. The nightmare had been so real, slowly being dragged backward into that fireplace, my body catching fire as it passed across the hearth. I was bathed in cold sweat, panting, and Mary was there. Moist cloth across my forehead. Touching me gently her eyes appearing before mine. 

I groaned as she removed my pants, and trembled as I hardened for her. Then she was on me, and I was in her. That pretty face before me. Caring, worried, kissing my brow. 

"I didn't know," I whispered. 

She soothed me the only way she could, calming me, draining me, and taking my fear and self-loathing with it. 

I slept in spurts through the night, waking exhausted, trembling. And Mary would sooth me again. And again. 

Only when the dawn's early light bathed the room, did I sleep soundly. 

* * * 

When I woke, it was close to noon. I called in sick, and spent that day recovering. Talking with Mary, telling her my fears, my concerns. 

"Nobody goes up there. Nobody." 

She tugged my right ear firmly. 

"I should have listened to you. I'm sorry." 

Her fingers trailed down my cheek, and brushed my bruised lip. 

"Thank you. I...I don't know if I could have done that. If I could face that again. I can only imagine how difficult that must have been." 

She kissed me, quieting me, before soothing me once again. It was good for both of us. 

It was nearly dark before I dared go up to the second floor. I listened at the bottom of the stairs, hearing nothing coming from above. I gathered my courage, to do what I had to do. My legs were shaking as I went up the first step. 

She was above me, pushing me backward. 

"I have to. I have to lock that door. Make sure they can't come down." 

Abruptly, I was alone. Then I heard the bolt sliding home above. The terror faded for a moment, and I sat on the step, trembling. 

She took my hand in hers, and led me to my bed. She stayed with me through the night, making her presence known each time I woke up. She took care of my, soothing me, bringing my cock to attention, then slowly, gently, filling my need. Whatever it was up there had nearly broken me. Mary put the pieces back together. 

* * * 

By dawn I was restless. I got up and showered. Mary joined me, her touch bringing the usual results, and she won me my release under the relentless spray. I shaved, and put on decent clothes. Cooked myself breakfast. Called in to work. Tried to introduce some normalcy back into my life. I had to pick up Karen and Bev at 3:00. I couldn't let them see me like this. 

Routine helped. Bringing in firewood. Doing the dishes, cleaning up the 4th room upstairs, which I'd been using at my workshop. Every so often I'd go to the base of the stairs and listen. By lunch time, I could make it up to the third step before my heart would race out of control. 

Mary did what little she could. Touching me, ruffling my hair, giving me unexpected kisses. She even had me chuckle once, as she teased me. 

"You're going to have to be good now. They'll be home this evening." 

All that got me was another erection, which she dealt with promptly. 

A little after one I confirmed their flight was on time. I did a last few things, then headed out. I hope the blackness in my heart wouldn't show. 

* * * 

It was so good to see them walk through the security gates, I almost broke down then and there. I ran to them, showering them with hugs and kisses, while they laughed at me. 

"No flowers?" Karen teased. 

"I thought it was your turn," I told her, forcing a smile. "I figured the daisy would last a life time." 

She laughed, and waved her ring under my nose. She was wearing it. I should have guessed as much. 

It didn't take long to get their stuff. Most of it had been shipped. They only had two suitcases each. They'd left a few things behind after the last trip, and casually informed me they could shop for whatever they needed. 

"You're back for good? Tell me you're all done. This is it," I said. 

Bev gave my hand a squeeze. "It's done. You're stuck with me." 

"Us," Karen added quickly. "Stuck with us." 

"Good." 

* * * 

Things started off a little rocky. I imagine I was a big part of that. I still had issues, which I was struggling to overcome. I needed to find time to be alone with Mary now and then, for my own mental health. Only she could understand what I'd been through. 

My stitches were a cause of worry, but I assure both Karen and Bev it was a fairly tame accident, and there was nothing to be concerned about. 

The elevator was a hit, as were the new bedrooms. The new entrance road was a home run. They couldn't believe how much it did to remove the sense of isolation. For that matter all the changes were appreciated. We had guests almost right away, and within a month, we'd purchased a handicap accessible van, for Karen and Bev to use. They wasted no time getting integrated into the community. I was a little slower coming around. 

It was early April, and the weather was warming. I had notice some very strange changes in Bev. She was always in a great mood, and I caught her talking to herself, laughing, on a couple of occasions. I don't know how I could have taken so long to recognize it. 

I heard her chatting to herself in her bedroom, while Karen was out running an errand. I peeked in on her, and she suddenly got quiet. She turned toward me smiling. "I didn't hear you walk up." 

A gentle caress of my cheek and I could sense Mary was with me. It all fell in place. 

"You know," I said simply. 

"Know?" 

"About Mary. How long, Bev?" 

She leaned back in her chair, smiling. "Whatever are you talking about, Jack?" 

"C'mon, Bev. Give me a break. I don't know how I missed it this long. And I'm a little pissed at my girl, hiding it from me." 

"Is she your girl now?" 

"She has been since the first time you guys arrived. How long for you?" 

"Calm down, Jack. Have a seat. What's the matter? You're not jealous are you?" 

"No. But I don't like being played for a fool." 

"Like you did me?" Bev answered, her words sharper than usual. 

"I only hid it because it was so impossible. Nobody would ever believe it. I asked her if she was going to make herself known. She said she'd let me know when she did. I guess that was a lie. How long, Bev?" 

"Jack, if you don't calm down and relax, we're not going to have this conversation. There's no reason we can't discuss things like we always do. I would think you'd be happy about the turn of events. Now do you want to talk, or argue?" 

It took about 10 minutes before I was calm enough to talk reasonably. I felt betrayed by Mary. When she touched me, I pulled away, irritated. Bev kept speaking quietly reasonably, until I could deal with it. 

"I knew something was weird around Christmas. Your behavior, and the way you talked about her. How she said it was Ok to wear the pearls on New Year's Eve. The way you talked to yourself when nobody was around. Something wasn't right," Bev explained. 

"Then your bizarre attitude toward the upstairs. Your occasional bouts of unhappiness, the way you kept sneaking off around the house, Karen and I both noticed, and talked about it. We were concerned for you. She wasn't that happy you kept the picture of Mary in your bedroom. She put it away once, and it immediately reappeared." 

"I didn't do that." 

"I know. Now. I didn't then. I caught you talking to yourself, and found out you weren't. You were talking to her. Mary. I could hear you. I wondered for a moment if you weren't losing it. So I asked her. Over and over, until finally she relented. I let her know I was concerned, that I was worried for you, and how you'd changed. She opened up and told me. It's only been about a week now." 5

"And Karen's in on it too?" 

"No. Karen can't see her, can't hear her, can barely feel her, and only if Mary really works at it. She's not family, and is too distant. She's not open." 

"Why did you hide it from me? Both of you?" I asked. 

"We didn't mean to. We were both concerned for you. I was someone she could turn to. We're a lot alike, Mary and I." 

I felt her settle in next to me. Her soft touches, tentative. 

"Is she the same for you as me?" 

"No. She can communicate with me easier. It takes much less effort for her to speak with me. We don't know why. She says the same effort it takes to move something, she can talk to me. On the other hand, I'm not nearly as receptive to her touch. I've never seen her, but she says you can see her easily, when she makes the effort." 

I turned to Mary, where I felt her pressed to my side. "Is that true?" 

She appeared before me, smiling, nodding sadly. She pressed her lips to mine, and tugged my right ear. 

"You didn't see her just now?" I asked Bev. 

"Nothing. I could tell where she was from your reaction, but that's it. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I wonder if it's us, and not her." 

"How much has she told you?" I asked, nervous. 

Bev grinned. "Everything. And I mean everything. Like where she gets her strength from, if you're wondering. Pretty hard to believe." 

Once I got past the irritation, it was better. Mary settled into my lap, while Bev and I talked on and on. For the first time I could question Mary, through our intermediary. Strangely I didn't have that much to ask her. 

Our big question was how Karen would fit in. How would she take it? Bev and I both recognized how upset she would probably be, to find out she was sharing me with a woman who'd been dead for 80 years. A beautiful young who was getting a lot more sex than she was. We both understood we couldn't cut Mary off, only to have her fade away. 

Until we had that figured out, we were sitting on a powder keg. In the meantime it was business as usual, unless Karen was out of The House.

Things happen for the strangest reasons. I wonder if there isn't some great cosmic comedian guiding us all. 

Karen came home, after the heart-to-heart with Bev. She was glowing, but looked a little nervous. She called me downstairs, and I escorted Bev. She didn't need me to push her, she'd picked up a powered wheelchair, which gave her the run of the house. In the living room, Karen pulled me over to the couch and sat down with me. 

"I got some news today. It wasn't what I was expecting. I hope you're Ok with it." 

I didn't have time to wonder what she was talking about, because Bev immediately blurted. "You're pregnant!" 

"Bev!" Karen snapped. 

Bev looked suitable chastened while my mind did flip-flops. "Pregnant?" 

"Are you angry? I know we haven't talked about it." 

"Angry? Are you crazy? This is wonderful!" I stopped abruptly, wondering how she felt about it. "I mean, I think it's wonderful. Are you happy?" 

She launched herself into my lap, kissing me. "As long as you are. I'm going to keep it." 

"Of course you are. Was there any doubt?" 

She shook her head. "I was just nervous to spring it on you. I think we might have to start talking about a date. I know I'm wearing your ring, but don't you think it would be good for our baby to have married parents?" 

"Tomorrow if you want," I told her. "Whatever you want." 

Karen and Bev looked at each other. "I don't think we're in that big a rush. I'd like to do it up right. Church wedding, lots of friends, the whole works." 

I hugged her tightly, readily agreeing with whatever she wanted. I wasn't about to deny her anything. 

She was carrying my baby. 

* * * 

We hired a housekeeper to help with caring for Bev, and to assist Karen with the day-to-day chores. Four women in the house, albeit one of them a little hazy. I wasn't complaining. I was happy. 

When we got a chance, Bev, Mary and I would get together and talk. We were still trying to figure out how to deal with letting Karen in on our bizarre secret. Mary and I were getting together whenever we could, and it was getting awkward. We'd come close to getting caught, twice. We had to come up with a solution and soon. 

Life took care of that. 

* * * 

It was a Saturday in May. Karen was showing, and all the more beautiful for it. I'd gone into town on an errand, leaving Karen and Bev alone. 

I got home, and was barely in the door, before Mary had me by the hand, tugging me forward. On the second floor I found Bev at the base of the stairs, looking upward. I saw the third floor door was open, and my blood turned to ice in my veins. 

"She wouldn't listen," Bev told me anxiously. "She says it's high time someone cleaned up there. I tried to stop her, I did." 

Like Bev, I tried. I did. I made it up four stairs before my limbs locked up. I couldn't. "Karen?" I called out, hoping to coax her down the stairs. It was time, no matter what the fallout, she had to know. For her own safety, and that of our child. 

No response. I fought my way up one more step. "Karen!" I shouted. 

"Jack!" her desperate scream did what my own desire couldn't. She was in danger. Our baby was in danger. I took the stairs two at a time, fighting the terror welling up inside me. In the doorway I found her quickly, huddled in the corner, shaking. There was a broom in her hands, mop and bucket nearby. She was crying. Worse, my makeshift fireplace jam was askew, and flames were clawing their way out, edging past the end of the hearth, the wooden floor starting to blacken and smoke. 

I don't know how I managed it, but I ran across the floor toward her. Before I reached her I was flung against the wall. "Run!" I screamed at her. 

"I can't!" she cried, sobbing. I saw her struggling to move, going nowhere. 

I screamed toward the stairwell. "Get help! They've got her. There's a..." I got not further, before being thrust away from her. 

I got back on my feet, fighting back, once again feeling the malevolence, choking me, sending my heart racing out of control. I fought it, struggled forward, reaching for her. "Take my hand Karen!" 

She reached out toward me, then slid across the wall, landing on her ass next to the fireplace. She was shying from the flames, turning her face away. The floor was charring, and looked like it was about to go up. 

I struggled forward, making slow progress, taking blows to the body, but narrowing the distance between Karen and myself. "Come to me, please," I begged her. 

She seemed unable to resist at all. Sobbing she reached toward me. "Help me," she begged. 

I was almost to her, when the fireplace cover broke free, flying past me. A huge tongue of flame lashed out, a good three feet into the room, singeing my eyebrows. I screamed out, leaping toward Karen, only to fall short, and tumble to the side. She was screaming, moving inexorably toward the fire, her flailing arms and legs doing nothing to stop the movement. 

Another tongue of flame burst forth, and one of the floorboards ignited. It was slow to catch, but I knew it was the beginning of the end. The memory of my last encounter was vivid in my mind. But I wouldn't give up. Never. I crawled forward with all I could, reaching toward her kicking leg. Somehow, I got my hand on the cuff of her pants. I started pulling, a deadly tug of war. 

Instead of pulling her away from the fireplace, I was only drawing myself closer. She screamed again, as her other foot passed through the flames, the bottom of her jeans smoking. "Jack!" she shrieked. 

Then she was tumbling into my arms. I knew why. I could feel her. Mary was there. I don't know how she did it, but she was with us. Fighting with us. For a moment I saw her, an out of control wild woman flailing away at the dark. And then she was gone. 

I couldn't let her sacrifice be for naught. I ran for the stairs, dragging Karen behind me. I made it half way before I was thrown backward, tumbling, refusing to release my fianc√©e, my partner, the mother of my child. She was being dragged from me, and I saw the flames on the floor had spread, still only a few feet across, but growing. Our time was running out. 

I threw myself at an angle, back toward the corner, away from the fire. Karen followed, still crying, screaming for help. 

Then Mary was back. We were free again, and I wasted no time fighting toward the stairs. I thought I was going to make it, and then I was running alone, Karen skidding across the floor, sliding rapidly toward the flames. She seemed to hit a wall just a few feet short. 

"You bastards!" I found myself screaming, as I ran forward, grabbing her by the waist, and pulling. She was nearly hysterical, but she clung to me, as I struggled to free her. 

As abruptly as before, I knew I'd lost Mary again. Karen was being pulled from me, and for all my effort, I was losing. The fire was larger, several feet across, stretching into the room. I could feel the searing heat already, and I couldn't imagine how bad it was for Karen. 

She was slipping from my grasp as I was pummeled. I saw the naked fear in her eye, and prayed that Mary could help us one more time. I couldn't do it alone. I couldn't last time, and this time it was worse. 

"Leave her alone!" 

Karen fell into my arms, and I could feel it. The strongest ever. Mary was back. Then I recognized the screaming fury, heard the words, the tone. 

"Get out of my house! Leave us alone! I'll kill you. Kill you all!" 

Tears rolled down my face, as I picked up Karen, holding her, backing up slowly toward the stairs. The fight was no longer mine, and I almost pitied the bastards. 

The window shutters flew across the room, the glass shattering, letting the cool air in. Window after window burst open, and I was hunched over Karen protecting her from the flying glass. I couldn't stop watching, as the wind seemed to take form, the fire blown out, the fireplace suddenly black and empty. 

Mary appeared before me, and pushed me toward the steps. I heard the shrieking and pounding at the far end of the room. I turned and carried Karen down the stairs. 

At the bottom, I knew what I'd find, before I ever got there. Bev was lying on the floor, facing up the stairs, eyes open, staring lifelessly. I could still hear her voice, echoing down the stairwell. I put Karen down beside her, pulled my Mom's still warm body into my arms, and lost it. 

* * * 

"Go find Nana." 

"Mom!" the precocious tyke sighed, exasperated. "She's already sitting down." 

Karen turned toward the table, facing one of the two empty seats. "Bev, you know how I hate that. You're supposed to be watching Donnie." 

"Aunt Mary left him in the bathroom. You know how he's getting. Doesn't like to be helped. He'll be here in a moment," I explained. I turned to the gorgeous lady sitting across from me. "You know the rules, Bev. Napkin off the plate when you're here." 

"Spoilsport," Bev teased, shaking the napkin loose. 

I still couldn't get over how different she was from Mary. She looked like she was in her twenties, giving Mary a run for the money in the looks department. She teased me a lot, but she wasn't like my other wife, seated beside me, patient as always. 

None of us understand it. Bev doesn't need what Mary does. I'm not sure where she gets her energy from, but she has it in abundance. She claims it's love, and as long as we keep popping out kids, she'll stick around forever. The kids can hardly tell the difference between her and their parents. She's as real as can be, as far as they're concerned. Yet I can barely sense her touch, and Karen can't at all. 

Both Liz and Donnie react to Mary much as Bev did. They can't see her, except a hazy outline on rare occasions, but they can hear her, and sometimes feel her. After 5 years, with me she can appear almost as real as Karen, when she wants to. I don't tell Karen that. She still has some jealousy issues. 

Not many. Not after that day. I had a hard time explaining it to her, and a harder time getting her to believe it. No matter how hard she tries, she's not open to contact with them, accept a very rare touch. 

But she understands. Bev gave her life to save her, to save us. Mary risked her existance, and was almost lost. It was weeks before she was more than a hint in the air. I might have thought we'd lost her, if Bev hadn't assured me she was there. 

I feel sorry for Karen, and I know sometimes she feels left out. But she's loved by all of us, and when she gets out of sorts, it doesn't take much to remind her how loved she is. What we all risked. 

Bev says we're safe. They're gone. She proudly proclaims she kicked their ass, and when we tease her at what cost, she laughs at us. She feels better than ever. She says she was on her last legs, and now thinks she'll be around to see her grandkids have grandkids. She just may at that. 

Alright. It's not the most normal household. It's not that normal a house. But it works for us, most of the time. We have our issues, and I wonder how the kids are going to turn out, later in life, with the kind of upbringing they're receiving. If nothing else, it should be interesting.
