Wild Card Gone Wrong
====================
#1 

===

My name is Eric Jensen. I'm a journeyman carpenter. I'm 28 years old. I stand 6' 2" and weigh just over 200 pounds. I'm not bragging but I'm very good at my job. I know every aspect of building a house. I can pour cement, frame, roof, finish, pull wire and do the plumbing. Framing is what I do best. I have a couple of tricks I use. I can study a blueprint for a few minutes and remember all the dimensions. It gives me an edge because I don't have to go back and look all the time. I can also drive nails with either hand. 

My wife is Sarah. She is 5' 3" tall and weighs 115 pounds. She is half Irish with red hair and green eyes. She has perfect pale skin and is built like a lingerie model. We have been married for 5 years. I met her on a blind date. Yeah, go figure. She was a friend of one of my coworkers wives. We hit it off immediately. We were fucking our brains out on our third date. Nine months later we were married. She works as a real estate agent. We both made good money and wanted for nothing. 

I have a brother that lives in Florida. He moved there to be near our Mom. Our dad passed away two years ago. The big C got him. Mom took it hard and Gary transferred to another office near her. She lives in their guest house. Gary is two years older than me. He is married and has two beautiful kids. Mom spoils the crap out of them. His wife, Amy works as a real estate broker for a nation wide company. He is in some kind of sales and is very good at it. He can sell ice to Eskimos. 

I was working for a guy in the San Diego area. He was trying to start up a business building tract homes. He was a pretty good carpenter but not a good business man. He folded after just six months. Yep, I was out of a job. I decided to take some time off and do some work around the house that I had been letting go. My wife started looking at me sideways after a few days so I decided it was time. I went job hunting. 

I'm driving around in my Dodge three quarter ton Dooley. It has side cabinets on it to carry and lock up all my tools. I find a tract that was about half finished. I ask around for the boss. 

"Hi, My name is Eric. Do you need any help?" 

"What do you do?" 

'All of it." 

He looks me over and smiles. 

"I need a framer. Are you up to it." 

"Can I have a audition?" 

He takes me over to a slab that was ready to be framed. He hands me the plans and says, "Show me." 

I didn't say a word. I look at he plans for a few minutes, walk to my truck and dig out my tools. I walk back and say, "Bring me a unit of two by fours and some nails." 

He glances at my tool belt an sees two hammers. They are thirty two ounce framing hammers. He doesn't say anything. He motions to the forklift driver and tells him to bring me the lumber. I quickly lay out some boards and start to work. I keep my head down and concentrate on what I was doing. I work for about an hour switching hands with my hammer. Yeah, I was showing off but I needed a job. He must have been impressed. He hollers at me. 

"Hey, Eric." 

I look up and see four other guys standing by him. They are all smiling. 

"Tomorrow morning at daylight." 

He turns and walks away. I have a job. 

I knew Sarah has a short day so I call her. 

"Hey, baby. I got a job and I'm headed home." 

When I use the phrase 'headed home" she knows she is getting fucked. We play a little game. She would hide somewhere in the house. I would hunt her down, drag her out and fuck her right on the floor. We both love doing it. She was a passionate woman and it was all I could do to keep up with her. 

I pull into the driveway and hop out. My cock was half hard already. I open the door and walk in. 

"I'm home, Honey. You know what's going to happen when I find you." 

I take off all my clothes and start looking in all the usual hiding places. I finally find her in the bedroom closet. She is on the floor with some clothes over her. I see part of her foot sticking out. I grab the closet door and pull. I guess I was a little excited. I rip it off the hinges. She squeals as I grab her by one ankle. I pull her out. She is stark naked and wet. I drop to my knees between her legs. She squeals again as I spread her legs. I lick and suck her to two quick orgasms and move up. I feed her my cock as fast as she can take it. She locks her ankles behind my ass and away we go. She cums two times before I dump my cum in her. We both cry out as we cum together. 

We hug and kiss for a while right there on the carpet. I finally let her up. 

'You animal. You just walk in her and take what you want, huh?" 

"Yep. And you're just what I want. I though we would celebrate me getting a new job." 

"Oh yes. I hope you get another new job tomorrow." 

"Let's go out to dinner and dancing tonight." 

"You're on, big guy and you owe me a new closet door." 

********************* 

I show up the next morning. As I look around I see that John knows his business. He is well organized and has good employees. It looks like a production line. His crews are the right size so as one crew finishes the next one needed is just finishing. I found out later that he gives cash bonuses if the job is ahead of the bid. Sometimes he would show up with a couple of cases of beer at quitting time. He takes good care of his crews and they work their asses off for him. 

I work for him through that spring, summer and into the fall. I have a good nest egg built up. I keep the bonus money in a coffee can in the garage. I'm planning on surprising Sarah with a vacation in Hawaii. I have about $3000 saved. 

One day we're all on the job, but some thunder storms came through and the whole site was a mud hole. None of the equipment could run in it. We're waiting for John to show up and I'm sitting under a framed and roofed house with some of the other guys. We're drinking coffee and telling lies. My cell phone rings. 

"Hello" 

"Eric. It's Amy. How are you and Sarah doing." 

"Holy crap, Amy. It's been ages. We're good. How's Mom, Gary and the kids." 

"We're all good. Guess what?" 

"Ummm. You're knocked up again?" 

"No, you silly. I'm in town. I'm here for a seminar. Can we meet for lunch?" 

"For sure. I'll call Sarah and we'll meet you. Where are you?" 

She tells me the hotel and I call Sarah at home. She had mentioned she didn't have any clients today. She doesn't answer and the machine takes the call. I don't leave a message. I try her cell phone and it goes to voice mail. She is probably out shopping and forgot her phone. I'll make plans for us to see Amy for dinner. I'll fill her in when I get home. 

An hour later John shows up and sends us all home. I head out to Amy's hotel. As I walk into the restaurant I see Marcie sitting with some girlfriends. I ignore her and look for Amy. 

A little about Marcie. I call her "The Nose". She has her fucking nose in every ones business. She is also the biggest gossip on the planet. As you can tell, we don't get along very well. She's friends with my wife for some strange reason. They are as different as chalk and cheese. Marcie is just coming off a tough divorce. He old man got sick and tired of her and left. She is really bitter about it. I'm heard her talking to Sarah about it "How could that asshole leave me. I'm a great wife, blah blah blah." I'm surprised they lasted as long as they did. 

Anyway, I find Amy and we hug and she gives me a quick kiss on the lips. It's nothing unusual. She is just a kissie feelie kind of girl and she loves the crap out of Gary. We have a nice lunch and catch up on everything. She is due for a meeting so I walk her to the elevator. As we walk out of the restaurant I notice Marcie is looking at us. She is about to twist her neck off getting good look. I see her out of the corner of my eye and just keep walking. Of course, Amy has a firm grip on my arm. A quick hug and a kiss and Amy goes into the elevator. I go out and get in my truck and drive off. I decide to stop at my favorite watering hole for a couple of beers. I nurse a couple of beers and shoot the breeze with some of the guys know. Three hours later I get up and leave. 

I pull into the driveway and park. I go in and the house is empty. I look in the garage and Sarah's car is gone. I go in the bedroom and change into shorts and a t shirt. Back in the den I go to turn on the TV. 

I decide to call her cell phone. 

"Hello." 

"Hi, baby. Where are you?" 

"I'm at Mom's she isn't feeling well. 

"Nothing serious I hope." 

"I don't know. I'm going to stay overnight. I'll call you tomorrow and let you know what's up." 

"OK, tell her to get better." 

"Goodbye, Eric." 

I notice she sounds a little strange. I chalk it up to her Mom being sick. I go to the kitchen and make a snack. I kick back and watch a movie. I wake up later and go to bed. 

I wake up the next morning and reach over for Sarah. I need to get rid of my morning wood. Me and my wood are disappointed. I take a shower and make some coffee. The weather is still crappy so I know I have the day off. I kill some time and decide to call Amy. 

"Hello' 

"Hi, baby. How's Mom?" 

"I'm taking her to the doctor." 

"Oh crap. Do you need any help?. I'm off today" 

"No, I'll handle it." 

That tension it there but stronger. Again I think it's just because her Mom is sick. 

"OK, call me if you need anything." 

"Goodbye, Eric." 

I screw around for the rest of the day. Nothing but crap on TV. Not even any good games on. After I eat some dinner I decide to crank up my laptop and cruise through some porn. Before I can open my favorite site I see an email. It's from Sarah and it has a video attached. 

I double click on it and a bedroom appears. A big king size bed with a canopy is in the back ground. 

"What the fuck is this?" 

I see Sarah standing in front of the camera with her hands on her hips. She is completely nude. 

"You dirty cheating son of a bitch. How dare you cheat on me. I'll show you, you son of a bitch. Just you fucking watch." 

The camera pans over and I see two black guys sitting on a sofa. She walks over to them and turns. I go into shock and click the pause button. This woman has lost her mind. I would never cheat on her. My brain goes on tilt. My stomach knots up and I run to the bathroom and yark up my dinner. I hug the toilet for a few minutes and finally get enough strength to stand up. I wash my face with cold water and go back to see what the fuck is on the video. I click play. 

"This is Leon and Tyrone. I'm going to fuck them and you're going to watch, you cheating bastard" 

"No, Sarah. Don't do this. Please, no, no." 

I sit there in a stupor, watching her take their clothes off. They are both sporting about seven inch cocks. She grabs both and turns to the camera. She smiles and strokes them. They both come up full hard. They must be at least ten inches hard. 

I can't form words. All I can think is, "Don't to it. Please. Don't do it." 

In total shock I watch as she leads them both to the bed. She sits on the bed and starts sucking on their cocks. She switches back and forth, stroking one and then the other. She looks at the camera. 

"Look, Eric. See these big cocks. They're way bigger than yours. I'm going to really enjoy taking them both at once." 

"I sit there watching and the tears come. I can hardly see the screen. I click on the stop button. Her viciousness shocks me to the core. I knew she had a temper but nothing like this. This is way past revenge. 

I try to regain some kind of control over myself. She thinks I cheated on her. Then it hits me. I was with Amy yesterday and that bitch Marcie saw us. That fucking bitch couldn't wait to call her. The man hater has convinced her I was cheating. 

My eyes keep going back to the screen on my laptop. I don't know if I want to see the rest of it or not. I slam the lid shut and get a bottle of whiskey out of the liquor cabinet. I don't bother with a glass. I drink my self into unconsciousness. 

I wake the next morning and try to move. Everything hurts. My head feels like someone has driven two nails into my temples and my mouth tastes like the bottom of a bird cage. Well done, asshole. Your troubles are still here and you just added a little more with a beauty of a hangover. I promise God I'll never do it again. I stumble into the bathroom and eat a hand full of aspirin. I fall into the shower and let the hot water run over my aching body. I dry off and stumble to the kitchen. I put some coffee and sit at the table. 

"Fuck! Fuck. What a bunch of shit came down my pipeline and it all landed in my lap. I've lost the love of my life and the best fuck on the planet. She fucked two guys and made a video for me. It amazes me that she didn't come to me and ask me about it. I could have explained it and we could have gone to dinner and everything would be great. Instead she listens to the man hater bitch Marcie. A nice pile of shit I'm sitting in. The aspirin kicks in and I feel a little better. 

********************** 

Marcie 

I'm sitting in the hotel restaurant with two of my friends. It's been a month since my divorce was final and I'm still pissed about it. My asshole husband just up and had me served out of the blue. He never told me why. The papers said some irreconcilable bullshit. My friends have been here for me since all of my misery started. I don't know what I would have done without them. 

We're sitting here chatting and I see Eric walk by. He is headed into the bar. I wonder what he is doing in a hotel bar in the middle of the day. I know it can't be anything good. He's a carpenter. What reason could he have to be here. I'll keep my eye out. 

Forty five minutes later I see him walking out with a beautiful woman on his arm. They are laughing and having a great time. They head around the corner to the elevators. By the time I can get there they are both gone. I watch the floor indicator stop at the third floor. It hits me; that bastard is cheating on my friend. I quickly call Sarah. 

"Hello." 

"Sarah. What ever you're doing drop it and meet me at my house. I have something terrible to tell you." 

"What, Marcie. What happened." 

"Not on the phone. This has to be in person." 

"I can be there in fifteen minutes." 

"OK, bye. 

As I pull into my driveway I see Sarah pull up to the curb. We both jump out. 

"What's so terrible that we have to meet like this. You sounded like you were in a panic." 

"Come inside. Not here on the street." 

Sarah sits down at the kitchen table and I pour two glasses of wing. 

"I was at the Radisson having lunch with Trixie and Jane. I saw Eric come in and go to the bar. I knew he was up to no good. What possible reason could he have going in a bar in the middle of the day. Later I saw him come out with some blonde floozy on his arm. They were laughing and she was hugging his arm like they were old friends. They turned the corner toward the elevators. Before I could get up to see where they went they both disappeared. I watched the floor indicator go up to the third floor. I knew right then they went up there to fuck. 

"That dirty son of a bitch. How could he do that to me. I've been the perfect wife to him for all these years. I'll cut his nuts off, that bastard." 

I see her tears running down her cheeks. I run and get a box of tissue. 

"What a fucker he is. You have a ton of wild cards to play. The way their were carrying on I'll bet they've been fucking for a long time." 

"What's a wild card?" 

"He cheated on you, now you can fuck someone to get even. We need to plan some revenge for him. Pay that rat bastard back." 

"Great idea. I want him to feel the pain I feel. What can we do." 

"I've got an idea. You fuck someone and we'll make a video for him. Then email it to him. Get some guy with a bigger dick than his. Guys always worry if about the size of their dick." 

"OK, who do we get? I don't know anyone like that." 

"I remember two guys who were at a friends bachelor party. They were both huge. Ten inches at least. I'll call her and get their number. They are both black. That should add a little pain for that asshole. You could do them both." 

"Oh my god. I've never done it with a black guy, let alone two guys." 

"This will be the payback of the century. Two black guys with huge dicks." 

"Let's do it. I want him to burn." 

"OK, I'll set it up. I have a high def video camera. I'll shoot it for you. All you have to do it open your legs. They will do the rest. This is gonna be so great. I would like to be a fly on the wall watching when he sees it.' 

************************ 

I'm ready to go to work so I call John. 

"How's it looking on the site, John." 

"It's still a little wet. We should be good to go the day after tomorrow." 

"OK, see you there." 

Even with all the shit coming down on me I can't let him down. I need to get my shit all in one pile and show up for work. I spend the rest of the day getting well. I hydrate myself and eat a couple of a square meals. By the end of the day I feel almost normal. 

All the while I'm trying to figure out what to do. I'm really hurt that my wife just fucked up a perfect marriage. I'm super pissed at fucking Marcie. I wish I could smash her face but I know she isn't worth going to jail for. I know I'll need a lawyer to look out for my interest. I look through the yellow pages and pick one out. I call and set up an appointment. He had a cancellation and can see me tomorrow. I really don't want to pull a scorched earth on her but I'm going to do something. I'll think of something later. I know the marriage is done and I'll be moving on. 

The next day I show up at his office. I give him all my details and show him a copy of the video. 

"Damn. She is really pissed at you. I've been doing this a long time and I've never seen anything like this." 

Well, she has this friend that is a man hater. I'm sure she put her up to it." 

"Wow, some friendship." 

"What ever she asks for I just want a fifty fifty split with no alimony. She makes about the same as I do." 

"No kids are involved so this should be a real quick one. Everyone signs and we wait ninety days and it's final." 

********************* 

Two days later I'm banging nails. Every nail is Marcie's head. I smash her again and again. I look up and see a guy in a suit looking around. He approaches John and says something. John points at me and he walks over. I know what he is up to. 

"Are you Eric Jensen?" 

"Yep." 

He hands me a manila envelope and says, "You've been served." 

He turns and walks away. John walks up. 

"What was that all about?" 

"I just got my divorce papers. Sarah and I are splitting." 

"What? I thought you guys were OK." 

"I did too. After all this shit is finished I'll probably leave the area. I'll stay with you till we finish this tract. Then I'm quitting." 

"I see. We'll miss you around here. You're one of my best men. I'll give you a letter to take with you. You probably don't need it but I'll do it anyway. You're good enough to get a job anywhere." 

"Thanks, John. It's been good working for you. I'll miss it too." 

"Where you planning on going?" 

"I don't know yet. Maybe up north." 

"I know a guy up in Healdsburg. It's north of San Francisco on highway 101. Maybe you could hook up with him. I'll give you his name and number. He's an old friend of mine." 

"Thanks. That may be just far enough for me." 

*********************** 

We meet with both attorneys. Sarah wants the house and alimony. We counter with a fifty fifty split, sell the house and no alimony. Her attorney advises her to accept it. He tells her if it goes before a judge it will be split that way so there is no sense asking for more. I give it one last try to explain what happened. I don't do it for a possible reconciliation. I just want her to know how she fucked up. She calls me a liar and a home wrecking cheater. I give that idea up and drive home.  

===

I put my payback plan into action. I'm going to use the video. I load the video into my movie maker program. I edit out everything but her fucking the two guys. I dig around in her desk and find her back up disc. I copy all of her email addresses into my mail program. I plan on sending this to everyone she knows. 

Two months later we finish the tract. I collect my last paycheck and bonus and go home. The house has sold and I have a week to vacate. The divorce is final and I never hear a word from Sarah. I's just as well. I decide not to wait any longer. I load all my tools and personal stuff up. With one look back I drive away. As I head north on Interstate 5 I sense a release. Each mile the weight on my shoulders lessens. Sarah is in the past and it's behind me. I've got a nice little stash under my seat. With my cash and the money from the sale of the house I have just a little over $250K and a bad taste in my mouth. I figure a little mouthwash will fix that. 

********************** 

I pull into the outskirts of Healdsburg, find a relatively nice motel and check in. I connect to the motel WiFi and open my email program. I start a new email and for a subject I put "How to end a marriage" I include all the addresses I got from her disc. I attach the edited video and click send. I think how nice it would be to be a fly on the wall when she tries to explain that to all of her friends and family. With a smug smile I unpack. I had noticed a Denny's when I stopped at the motel. I get something to eat and come back to my room. I watch TV for a while and fall asleep. 

The next morning I go apartment hunting and find a nice furnished two bedroom in a nice part of town. I get moved in and go to meet the guy John put me onto. He doesn't have anything going at the time but he has a bid in on a fifty unit tract. Two weeks later his bid is accepted. He gets the surveyors and the earth movers in and the tract is ready to go. All the houses are on slabs and he got the cement contractors and plumbers going right away. Two weeks later the lumber started showing up. I start to work. He has trouble getting skilled carpenters so I had to take some under my wing and train them. It slows me down but the work is getting done. 

On weekends I start looking around for a house to buy. I find a three bedroom, two bath on five acres that needs some work. It belonged to an old couple. They got too old to take care of it and the kids took them in and put the place up for sale. It has a two acre vineyard that's in pretty bad shape. I didn't know anything about grapes so I leave it alone. I get the place for a song. Nice and quiet. I work on it on weekends and get it in good shape. It just needed a new roof, sheet rock and a new kitchen and bathrooms. I finally get moved in. 

Keeping busy has helped me push all the pain and anger from my mind. My depression lifts and I finally start to feel right with the world. It's time to start looking around. Mrs. Palm and her five daughters just aren't getting it done. A couple of guys tell me about some Indian Casinos up north. They said they serve some pretty good food at the Sho-ka-wah Casino near Hopland. I decide to try it first. 

******************** 

After enjoying a nice T bone steak dinner I make my way to the Blackjack tables. I'm not a high roller and haven't played much but I know the basics. I watch the tables to see which dealers are hot. I notice a cute little blonde talking to the pit boss. A seat opens at one of the tables and I sit. It's a $5 minimum bet table. I buy in $100. Five minutes later the little blonde pushes in. As I'm looking her over she notices and smiles. I see her name is Brenda. She looks pretty good to me and I mentally think I'd like to knock the dust off of her. I notice she isn't wearing a wedding ring. 

"Hi, Brenda. Please be gentle with me." 

She smiles and says, "We'll see." 

Twenty minutes later I'm buying another $100. I try betting some for her but my luck doesn't change but I get her attention. On my third buy in I notice she is checking me out. She is sly about it but I watch her out of the corner of my eye. 

I decide I've had enough abuse and color up. I leave her a $20 tip and head for the cage. I cash in and go home. On the way home I think about her. She seemed real nice while she took my money. Maybe, just maybe. 

Two more days of banging nails and I go back. I find her table and buy in another $100. We smile at each other and start playing. Over the next half hour I catch a few cards and we both win. I continue betting for her knowing that she will notice. Just before she goes on break she asks my name. I give her my best smile and my name. 

Over the next month I go in about twice a week. She is friendly with me and greets me by name. As I leave one evening I make a note and put it in a stack of four red chips. I hand it to her. She smiles, taps it on the rack and puts in her shirt pocket. The note said, "For dinner and some conversation call me. 

Friday night my phone rings. 

"Hello." 

"Hi. Is this Eric or is it some kind of a joke?" 

"It's no joke." 

"So you want to go out to dinner, huh?" 

"I couldn't resist asking such a beautiful lady. The answer is yes. Are you up of it?" 

"You seem like a nice guy. Let's give it a go." 

"OK, make a reservation at your favorite place for tomorrow evening. I'll meet you there." 

"OK, I'll text you the place and time." 

"Great, see you there." 

"Bye bye." 

I do a little happy dance around my living room. 

******************** 

As I'm driving to the meet up, I'm thinking that it was a good move to meet her there. We would both have the chance to run if things don't work out. 

I walk in and see her sitting in the waiting area. She looks up at me and flashes a big smile. Of course I return it. The second thing I notice is that she looks way better in real clothes instead of her dealer clothes. She is wearing a short denim mini skirt. God bless whoever invented it. She was wearing a semi transparent white blouse with her lace bra showing. My cock twitches. 

"Hi, Brenda. It's nice to see you away from the casino." 

"Hi, Eric. I like to get away now and then. Dealing is kind of high pressure. Not many places you work with a camera recording every move you make." 

We followed the hostess to our table. 

"Ok, what's your favorite wine?" 

"Ummm White will do. How about a white zin." 

"OK, seafood it is." 

We sip our wine and check out the menu. She orders the seafood combo and I order prawns. It's easy random chat as we eat. About thirty minutes into dinner her phone rings. 

"Please excuse me. I should take this call." 

She answers and all I hear is short replies. "Yes, no, yes, yes. Good bye." 

I smile and ask her, "Was that your escape call." 

"OK, I'm busted. It was." 

"I don't see you running toward the door." 

We both chuckle. 

"Not yet. By the way, when is yours coming." 

"I don't have one set up. I figure I can just out run you if I need to." 

"I don't see you running either." 

"What's the old saying, My mama didn't raise no fools." 

We finish the evening off with nice relaxed chat. I notice she is nice to be with. She smiles a lot and has a good sense of humor. Most of all I see that she seems comfortable with herself and doesn't come on as a phony. 

I walk with her to her car. She turns and puts her hands on my shoulders. I put mine on her waist and pull her toward me. She lets her arms slide around my neck and we hug. She leans back and gives me a quick peck on the lips. 

"Thanks for a nice evening, Eric." 

"Thank you too. Was it nice enough for a repeat?" 

"Yes, it was. Let's go for next weekend." 

I give her a quick peck on the lips and watch her get in her car.. I feel like my feet aren't even touching the ground. I stand and watch her drive away. I'm feeling something good will come of this. The next few dates will tell. 

Monday at work all the guys notice my mood change. I get lots of remarks about getting laid and falling in love. I just smile and keep working. Finally they let up. 

Tuesday evening I make my appearance at the casino. I take a seat at Brenda's table and buy in $500. She gives me a funny look and pushes my chips to me. I change up a green for five reds. I bet two green and a red for her. She looks at me and smiles. She deals me a black jack. She pays my $75 and $7.50 for herself. 

"Good start. Let's keep it up." 

She just smiles. I win the next three hands. I stay about even for the rest of the evening. I just smile at her and walk out the door. 

Wednesday I beg off work early and go looking for car lot row. I find a BMW dealership. I find a nice two year old two door. I pay for it with a wire transfer. I have them call a detail shop to pick it up. Three hours later they call me that it's done. I ask them to deliver it and tell them I'll drive the guy back to their place. I'm now the proud owner of a nice clean BMW. 

For the rest of the week I stay away from the casino. Thursday evening I send her a text. "Friday night. Dinner and dancing. Text me the place and time." Ten minutes later I get a reply. "Pick me up at six." and her address." 

I pull up to the curb in front of her house. I trot to the door. She opens the door and my mouth drops open. She is a vision of beauty. A burgundy dress that hugs he figure. The hem is at mid thigh. Spaghetti straps hold it up. Nipples are poking through the thin fabric. There's something about blondes in burgundy dresses that fires my rocket. 

"Eric. My eye are up here." 

"I know. I'm just admiring the scenery. I'll get to them in a minute." 

We both laugh. 

"I should have brought my gun. I'm gonna be fighting guys off all night long." 

"Don't worry. I only dance with my date." 

I drive and she navigates. We enjoy a nice dinner and follow the music to the dance floor. The hostess seats us and I order a carafe of White Zinfandel. We sip and chat for a few minutes. A fast set starts and I pull her to the dance floor. I'm not a really hot dancer but I hold my own. After three songs we return to our seats. 

"Great idea, Eric. It's been a long time since I went dancing." 

"A long time for me too. I guess you can tell by the way I dance." 

"You did just fine. You have nothing to be ashamed of." 

A slow set start and I take her hand. She moves into my arms and my cock twitches. Her firm breasts are against my chest. I can feel her hard nipples through my shirt. I pull her a little closer and my cock presses against her. She doesn't pull back. A few minutes later she pushes against me. My cock is half hard by now. She looks up at me and smiles. I lean down and give her a kiss. She holds on and returns it. I feel her tongue touch my lips and I let it in. I pull her tighter against my cock. I hear her gasp. She moves a little sideways and I feel her mound on my thigh. Our breathing rate goes up. The music stops and I don't notice. She taps me and brings me back to the present. She pulls me back to the table. She looks at me and I can see it in her eyes. I lean over and whisper in her ear. 

"Go in the ladies room and take off your panties. Bring them to me." 

Her eyes pop open and she gives me a naughty smile. Without a word she stands up and and walks away. A few minutes she comes back. She smiles at me and hands me her panties. 

"I feel so naughty. You're such a bad boy suggesting that." 

"You are naughty. I like that in a woman." 

"You're a bad boy. I like that in a man." 

We dance three more slow ones and go back to our table. 

"Let's get out of here, naughty girl." 

She just smiles. We go to the bar and I settle up the tab. As we walk up to my car I reach down and slap he gently on the ass. She squeaks and jumps a little. She turns and I take her in my arms. We kiss for a few minutes. I reach down and grab her ass. I work her dress up and hold her naked ass cheeks. She moans in my mouth. She pulls back and looks at me. 

"Eric, take me to you home and make love to me. Make me feel like a woman. It's been so long." 

I just smile and help her into my car. As we're driving along I suggest. 

"Wanna get more naughty?" 

"Ummm. What did you have in mind?" 

"It's dark. Take your dress off. Ride to my house naked." 

"Oh my god, Eric. You are really bad." 

She thinks a minute and slowly lifts her dress over her head. 

"Like this?" 

"Just perfect. Now if I can just make it home without wrecking." 

I keep glancing at her as I drive. All she has on is her black thigh highs and her heels. I reach over and caress her thigh. She gasps and pulls my hand to her pussy. I slide one finger into her wet slit. She moans and holds it in her. She turns and looks at me. 

"You need to get naughty too. Take yours off." 

'You'll have to help me. I'm driving." 

Between the two of us we get my shirt off and my pants down around my ankles. She leans down and takes off one shoe and pulls my leg out of my pants. She does the other and I'm completely naked. 

"That's better. No, concentrate real hard on driving." 

She reaches across the console and grabs my cock. She strokes it up to full hard. She manages to move around and kisses my cock head. I almost hit another car. 

"Pay attention to your driving. You'll kill us. I wanted this the second time I saw you." 

"I wanted this the first time I saw you. And now all the blood is running from my big head." 

She laughs and sucks half my cock in her mouth. 

"Oh fuck. This is gonna be quick. It's been a long time." 

She mumbles something around my cock and keeps sucking. I feel a stirring in my loins and my cum shoots into her mouth. She squeaks through her nose and stays on it. She catches every drop. I almost hit another car. 

"Keep driving, bad boy. This is just the beginning." 

By the time we get to my house she has stroked my cock back up to full hard. I pull up to my house and get out. I go around and open her door. She jumps into my arms with her legs around my waist. I let her slide down till my cock shaft is toughing her wet pussy lips. I hold her and move toward my doorway. I stop and lift her. I line my cock up with her wet pussy lips and let her down on it. She groans and my cock head parts her pussy lips. 

"Oh god yes., Eric. Yes. Yes. Give it all to me. Make me your woman." 

I let her down till our bones meet. I hold her up with one hand and open the door with the other. As I take us to my bedroom I feel her pussy muscles squeezing my cock. I pull out of her and drop her on the bed. 

"No no. I want it. Shove it back in me." 

"All in good time, naughty girl. We have all night." 

I spread her legs and move between them. 

"Put your hand behind your head. Open up and give me all of you." 

She moans and does what I ask. She open her legs for me. I kiss her left nipple and tweak the right one. She moans for me. I switch back and forth. He nipples swell up like strawberries. I hold both of them and kiss my way down to her pussy. I give it one long lick from bottom to top. She cries out and humps up. I slide one finger in her and kiss her labia. She moans for me. I attack her pussy with every trick I know. Three fingers in her pussy rubbing her G spot. She has her first cum of the evening. 

"Oh god, yes. Fuck yes. Fucking god yes." 

I make her cum three more times and go for the big one. I rub her G spot and suck up her clit. He body goes stiff and she screams. Her orgasm rips through her body. 

"Oh god, Eric. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. God yes." 

I move up and hold my cock head against her pussy lips. She finally moves her hand from behind her head and grabs my ass cheeks. She pulls down and pushes up with her hips. The exquisite feeling of my cock filling her takes over. I push down and bump her clit with my bone. She cums again. I hold against her clit and let her work on it. She makes herself cum two more times. 

"Make me cum, baby. Make my cum shoot in you. Make me fill your pussy." 

"Fuck yes. Cum in me. Fill my hot pussy. Shoot that hot cum in me." 

I start stroking and she squeezes me. My nuts pull up and I cry out and fill her. She squeals and cums with me. We both grind against each other till my balls are empty. 

She holds me in her saddle and locks her legs behind my thighs. 

"Am I heavy on you, baby." 

"No. lay on me. hold me and lay on me. I want to hold you. It's been so fucking long. I really needed this." 

"Too long for me too. I almost forgot what it was for." 

"Bull. You didn't forget. You did everything perfect. I've never cum that many time before. Not ever." 

Finally she rolls me off and snuggles her back to me. I have a face full of hair and two hands full of Brenda. 

"Hold me, baby. Hold me tight." 

"I got you." 

I hold her ass against my wet, half hard cock. She squeezes it with her cheeks. It slowly fills with blood. 

"I feel something against my ass. Is that yours?" 

'It's ours. Wanna do something with it.. 

"Yes. I want you take me doggie. It's my favorite way." 

I tweak both of her nipples as she rolls on her stomach. I move behind her and hold her by her hip bones. I line my cock up and push in. My balls touch her clit and my pelvis bone pushes against her ass. I push in hard and hold in her. She squeezes my cock and moans a little. 

"Fuck me Eric. Fuck me hard and make me your bitch." 

I pull back a little and slam into her. She meets my thrust with one of her own. I thrust into her faster and faster. She squeezes me harder. I grab a handful of her hair and pull back. Her back arches down and I go in deeper. She moans and cums. 

"Yes. Take me. take me. Fuck me hard. Slam that big cock in me." 

I feel it coming on and I grab both of her wrists. I pull her arms back and pound into her. She starts cumming and cumming. My cock flares and I give her my second load. She pushes back and milks every drop from my cock. 

I fall on her back and we both collapse. I hold her back to me again. 

"Yes. So good. You're so good for me. You make me cum and cum. What a lover you are." 

"Your hot pussy makes me do that. It's all your fault." 

'I'll gladly take the blame for that." 

We snuggle and kiss for a while and fall asleep. 

******************* 

I wake the next morning and find myself alone in bed. I hear noise coming from the kitchen. The smell of bacon cooking assaults my nose. I stretch and get out of bed. My morning wood leads me into the bathroom. I urinate, brush my teeth and hop in the shower. I smile as I wash the cum and pussy juice off my body. I dry off and give myself quick shave. 

I stand in the kitchen door getting a good look at Brenda. I haven't had a good chance to check out her body. I was too busy last night to take a close look. She is facing away doing something on the stove. He naked ass catches my attention first. It's just a little wider than the ideal model, but it looks sexy as hell. Last night comes to mind as I remember holding her naked ass cheeks when we kissed at her car. Two nice hands full. She must have heard me and she looks around. 

"Good morning, bad boy. Enjoying the view." 

'Yep, and a mighty nice view is is. Nice ass you have there. In fact the whole package look pretty damn good." 

"Quit perving on me and sit down." 

"OK, I'll sit but I won't stop perving." 

She smiles and pours me a cup of coffee. She hugs me to her full breasts. I kiss each nipple and hold her by her ass. 

"Eat first. We can play later. You need to build up your strength. You're gonna need it. I'm gonna fuck your ears off today." 

"There you go, threatening me with a good time." 

I pat her on the ass and she sits. We both dig in. I notice she is giving me a serious look. 

"Something on your mind, baby?" 

"Just wondering about what baggage you're packing around. We all have some, you know." 

"Yeah, I have a little. I had a bad divorce a while back, but I'm pretty much over it. It's just a bad memory now.  

===

'Want to tell me about it?" 

"Do you want to hear about it?" 

"Maybe we should compare war stories. Might help us understand each other better." 

"Ok, here goes. My wife had this friend that was a man hater. She saw me in a hotel restaurant with my sister in law. She was in town for a seminar and called me. So anyway, she couldn't wait to tell my wife about it. It was obvious that I was there to screw another woman. She worked on my wife all day and convinced her. So, instead of asking me about it, my wife picked up two black guys and made a video of her fucking them. I guess it was her idea of revenge. She wanted to hurt me. She emailed it to me. She never believed me when I told her the lady in question was my sister in law. I was in bad shape for a while. The rest is history. We split everything and I moved up here. 

"Wow. That sounds terrible. How could she not ask you about it first." 

"That bitch friend was the problem. She played my wife like a cheap fiddle." 

"It been a little over a year ago. I'm fine now. What's your war story?" 

"Not quite like yours. I came home early one day and found my husband in the living room getting fucked in the ass by his boyfriend. I never suspected he was bi. It was pretty easy to walk away from that. We didn't have any kids or many assets so it was over and done with quickly. That was two years ago. I got over it really fast. I still have that picture in my mind. I laugh about it now when I think about it." 

"I'll bet your mouth fell open when you saw that. I can see you standing there, speechless." 

"OK, enough of this downer stuff. Let's get this kitchen cleaned up and get back to business." 

"Good idea. Not that I've seen you naked in the daylight I see some places I want to inspect closer." 

"You look pretty good in the daylight too. Nice cock you have there. I'm guessing eight inches and I like the uncut part. First one I've seen. It looks like it needs more attention." 

"It's been neglected for quite a while. I'll expect you to change that." 

"Oh fuck yes. You can bet the rent money on that. I've got some neglected parts too." 

We spend the next two days trying to fuck each other to death. We're almost successful. Sunday night I take her home. We kiss goodbye and promise to get together as soon as possible. 

***************** 

Over the next few months Brenda and I become closer and closer. We profess our love for each other and she moves in with me. She keeps her job at the casino. She doesn't want to sit around the house all day alone. She does manage to get on day shift and soon gets promoted to pit boss. Six months after she moves in we decide to get married and start a family. Two month later she misses her period and she gives birth to a beautiful 7lb 3oz boy. She quits her job and ten months later she give birth to a beautiful 6lb 10oz girl. We decide two are enough to keep her busy and I get a vasectomy. 

I lose touch with all my friends in San Diego and never hear a word about Sarah. I suspect that Marcie has turned her into a carbon copy man hater. It would be a shame if that happened. She can be a very loving wife. 

Brenda and I are planning on retiring and growing old together to watch our grandchildren playing in our yard.
