I looked out the window at the freshly fallen snow. Up and down the street the houses were all decorated for the season. Santa's and reindeer on the roofs, Nativity scenes in front yards, outside trees strung with lights and inside trees shining through windows. Holiday spirit was everywhere, everywhere but in my house. I turned from the window and took in the scene. The tree lying on the floor, shards of glass from broken light bulbs and shattered Christmas ornaments. I suppose I should have seen it coming; Candy always did have a temper and she hadn't liked her Christmas present. She hadn't liked it at all. But what is it they always say? It isn't the gift, but the thought that counts? I took one last look at the mess and decided that cleanup could wait until the morning and then I went up to bed. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Candy and I had been married for five relatively trouble free years. I was her second and she was my third. We both had jobs in middle management and the two paychecks, along with no kids, meant that we were able to maintain a pretty good life style. Candy and I were party people and come the weekend you could almost bet that we would be at a party, throwing a party, or out on the town drinking and dancing. 

Candy was a beautiful and sexy woman and she attracted tons of male attention in staid circumstances and dressed conservatively. At parties where the liquor was flowing, the music is loud and the inhibitions lowered and she was dressed to kill the attention she was paid bordered on the outrageous. She was constantly hit on and men spend considerable time trying to separate Candy from the herd and get her to a place where some privacy would give them a chance to try their luck. Candy would fend them off good naturedly, but that never stopped them from coming back and trying again. 

And me? As with most men who have the great good fortune to have as desirable woman I had to learn to live with it. This is not a hard thing to do when you have absolute trust in your partner. I'd sit back secure in the knowledge that Candy was mine and that regardless how persistent the men were she would shrug them off. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Candy had a best friend. Marlene and Candy had known each other since grade school and were closer than most sisters. I didn't know Marlene all that well, but I didn't like her. There was just something about her that did not sit right with me. When I met Candy and we started dating Marlene always seemed to be around and I know it sounds silly when I say it, but whenever Marlene was around I felt 'bad vibes'. 

Fortunately, for my piece of mind, Marlene got married about six months before Candy and I did and Marlene's husband took a job in another state and they moved. Marlene and Frank were married in a civil ceremony and of course Candy just had to be there and I got drug along. I remember looking at Frank and wondering just what a together guy like him could possibly see in Marlene. Even though I barely knew either one of them I would have given odds of twenty to one against their union lasting. 

Frank and Marlene flew back to be there when Marlene and I married and I could not help but notice how haggard Frank looked and I wondered if it was caused by his new job or his new wife. 

Marlene might have been out of state, but that didn't mean she was out of Candy's life. The two of them talked on the phone two or three times a week and some of their weekend calls lasted for over two hours. One Sunday, after one of those two-hour calls, Candy asked me if I would mind if she took a couple of days and went to visit Marlene. 

"I have some comp time coming and things are not going well between her and Frank. She needs some cheering up." 

"Do you really think it wise to go down there and inject yourself into the middle of their problems? You just might make matters worse." 

"She is my oldest and dearest friend honey, but I'm not blind to her faults. She can be a little hard to live with and maybe my being there will take some of the pressure off Frank." 

I didn't think her going was a good idea, but I was smart enough to know that my trying to talk Candy out of it would only put a strain on our marriage so I just said: 

"You know her better than I do sweetie and if you think visiting will help go ahead." 

Candy was gone for five days and when she came back she seemed troubled about something. I assumed that her visit had not gone as she had expected, but I didn't pry and after a couple of days had gone by she was back to her old self. 

Six months went by and then Candy again asked if I would mind if she went to visit Marlene. I didn't want her to, but I didn't have a good reason for saying no and I knew I couldn't get away with just saying, "I'd really rather you didn't." All that would accomplish is having Candy ask me why and, "Because I don't like her" would not have been an acceptable answer. Candy was gone four days and when she came back she was a little out of sorts just as she had been after her first visit. But as with the last time after a couple of days she was fine. 

Over the next year Candy would take a three day weekend once every three or four months and go visit Marlene and she always came back just a hair out of whack, but after a couple of days whatever funk she was in would go away. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Then one day Candy came to me and said: 

Baby, can I ask you for a huge favor?" 

"I don't know why not. I never say no to you, do I?" 

"You just might this time." 

"Why would I do that?" 

"I'm not blind baby. You've never said a word to me about it, but I know that you don't care for Marlene." 

"I thought I hid that rather well." 

"Maybe from others, but I know you too well." 

"I take it that this huge favor has something to do with Marlene?" 

"She and Frank have split up and she's moving back up here. Can she stay in the spare bedroom until she can find a job and a place of her own?" 

I didn't want to say no - I wanted to scream "Hell no!" but all that would have done is make things uncomfortable between Candy and me. To keep the piece I had no choice but to say okay. A week later Marlene moved in and she hadn't been there a week and things started to change. Nothing major at first, just Candy and Marlene spending a lot of time together in the kitchen laughing and talking, which in itself was nothing, but it always seemed to taper off or stop when I came into the room. 

Next, Marlene and Candy started going out one night a week for a 'girls night out.' Next it was the two of them taking off every Saturday and Sunday to look for an apartment that they never seemed to find. The one thing that it took me weeks to notice was that when returning from the night out or the apartment hunt Candy would be just a bit distant from me, just as she had been when she returned from her visits to Marlene. It never more than a day, but it was there and I noticed it. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was at work one day when my secretary told me that there was a Frank McBride on line three for me. Frank was Marlene's husband or rather her ex-husband so I took the call. After a quick change of pleasantries he cut right to the chase. 

"I've agonized over this, first telling myself that it was none of my business and thinking that maybe you already knew - that you and Candy had one of those open marriages - but the more I thought about it the more I knew I had to call you. I wouldn't want it on my conscientious if you got AIDS." 

"What are you trying to tell me Frank?" 

"I'm not going to tell you anything Hal, what I'm going to do is send you a package. You can check it out and make up your own mind. The fact that Marlene is up there with you says that I have made up mine. I mailed the package this morning so you should have it by the day after tomorrow. Take care and good luck" he said just before he hung up. 

I couldn't for the life of me figure out what Frank was trying to tell me. I wasn't brain dead of course so it was obvious that whatever was in the package concerned Candy as well as Marlene and it was equally obvious that Frank didn't think I was going to be happy with what was in the package. His comment about an open marriage and AIDS gave me a hint of why he and Marlene split, but I had the utmost trust in Candy. 

The next two days dragged. Thursday morning a package arrived at my office. I told my secretary that I didn't want to be disturbed and I closed my office door and opened the package. The box contained videotape and an 11x14 manila envelope. I opened the envelope and found two dozen 8x10 pictures and a copy of a report from Simpson Investigations. The photos were of Marlene, Candy and three men and they had obviously been taken in a bar. The lighting was poor, but the photos showed the two women and the three men either dancing or sitting in a booth. The dancing photos that had Candy in them showed a man's hand on her ass as she smiled at him, a man's hand on her right breast as she smiled at him and two photos of a man's leg between hers and pushing against her crotch. Only one of the booth shots showed Candy clearly and in it a man had his arm around her and she was smiling at him. 

The other photos showed Marlene kissing the three men, being felt up by them and in a couple of the booth shots you could see a man's hand down inside her dress and on her tits as she smiled at him. In another you could actually see her hand on a man's cock as it stuck up out of his fly. 

The report from Simpson Investigations stated that they picked up the subject (Marlene) and an unidentified female companion (Candy) at 1945 hours at the subject's residence. The subject was followed to Harry's Bar and Grill where the subject and her companion met three as yet unidentified males. The report went on to say that the two women were observed being "exceedingly friendly" with the three males. 

"At one point the subject was observed stroking an exposed erect penis in the booth where the five were sitting." 

"At 2215 hours the two women and three males left Harry's and walked across the street to the Venus Motel and entered room 116 where they remained until 0130 hours. The subject and her female companion were then follow to the subject's residence arriving at 0205 hours." 

It looked as if my 'absolute trust' in Candy was a little bit misplaced. I took the videotape and went down to the conference room where we had a TV/VCR set up. I locked the door behind me and watched the tape. All it showed was Marlene and Candy walking from the bar with the three men to room 116 and going inside at eight-fifteen and it showed them coming out of the room at one-thirty. 

I had been married twice before and both marriages had ended when I caught my wives cheating so I already knew about how denial worked and how much waiting around hoping things weren't really all that bad and would get better would hurt in the long run. I called my friend Roger, who was also my lawyer, and asked him if he could spare me a few minutes of his time. He said he could fit me right in and so I went right over to his office. He pretty much told me what I had already figured out for myself. I didn't have a case, at least not based on what I had. He went over them point by point: 

"The photos mean nothing by themselves. We don't know what transpired in the instant before the picture was taken or in the instant after. The photo could have been taken the very instant that the man placed his hand on Candy's ass and the very next instant she could have shoved the hand away or slapped the man. The same goes with the photo of the man's hand on her breast or the man's arm around her. We don't know what happened immediately before or after and the investigators report doesn't mention Candy or what she did. Their subject was Marlene and that is who they concentrated on. 

"The tape proves nothing more than the two women went into a motel room with three men. They didn't go from the bar to the office and rent a room, which means one or more of the men were already staying there so you couldn't show intent to commit adultery. Once in the room we have no idea what they did. They could have played cards or watched videos for all we know. 

"What we believe went on doesn't matter, only what you can prove in court and you have no proof. What you have is a very strong reason to believe that your wife is cheating on you. You have two options: confront Candy and hope she admits it or hire your own investigator to get the goods on her." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

And so that is what I did. I hired a firm of private detectives and turned them loose. They quickly established that on the 'girls night out' Candy and Marlene hit the bars, picked up men and took them to motels. Because it was never the same bars or the same motels the investigators were having a difficult time getting good audio or video proof. 

"Do you have to travel as part of your job?" the lead investigator asked me. 

"Frequently." 

"Could you take a long trip, say four or five days, or fake a business trip of that length?" 

"I could, but why?" 

"Both women live in your home. It is where they are most comfortable and I believe that if you were gone for several days they would take the men they pick up to your house rather than a motel. It will be fairly easy to wire your house for audio and video." 

At dinner that night I told Candy that I had a business trip coming up the following week. "I'll be leaving Monday and won't be back until late Friday or maybe even Saturday so you have your work cut out for you." 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean between now and Monday morning you have to give me enough loving to hold me for a week." 

Candy smiled, "I can do that." 

And she did. She exhausted me almost every night until Monday came around. She even passed on her night out with Marlene just to stay home with me. 

Monday morning I kissed Candy goodbye, told her she could reach me on my cell phone if she needed me and I left the house on my pretend trip. I drove across town and checked into a hotel and then went to work. Marlene had found a job so Monday after both women had gone to work the detective agency went into the house and wired it. Tuesday morning the detective called me and told me that the two women had gone out, picked up two men and had gone to a motel. Tuesday night was a repeat of Monday night except the two women took the three men they hooked up with to a motel. 

The Thursday morning call told me that we'd hit pay dirt. The women had picked up two men and had taken them to the house. Thursday night it had been three men. The detective told me I could stop by his office on Friday afternoon to pick up the report and the tapes. I told them I would be there that afternoon and then I called Candy at work and told her I would be home that evening. 

That afternoon I went to the office's of Myron Investigations to pick up the report and the tapes. 

"Have you viewed them?" 

"Yes, we have viewed the product of both evenings." 

"Did we get what I need for a divorce?" 

"That's hard to say." 

"I don't understand. Did we or did we not get evidence of my wife cheating?" 

"Again, that is hard to say. You will have to view the tape and make up your own mind." 

"Oh come on. You either have her on tape fucking another man or you don't." 

"Well I can be clear on that. Your wife did not, on either of the two nights we have tape for, have sex with another man." 

"What are you saying, that she isn't cheating on me?" 

"Again, that has to be your determination. You will have to view the tapes and make up your own mind as to that." 

I paid the bill and then I took the tapes and went back to my office. Everyone had cleared out for the weekend so I went into the conference room, locked the door behind me and sat down to watch the tape. The Wednesday night portion started with Candy, Marlene and two men coming into Marlene's room. Marlene and the two men immediately undressed, but Candy went over to a chair, sat down and watched. 

Marlene went to her knees in front of one of the men and started sucking his cock. The other man walked over to Candy, waved his cock in front of her face and said: 

"Come on honey, get your clothes off and let's have some fun." 

"Sorry, but I told you before we even left the bar that I don't cheat on my husband. You knew before we even got here that it was only going to be you two and Marlene." 

"What is it? You get your kicks from watching?" 

"Whatever. The only thing you need to know is that you aren't going to get lucky with me." 

The tape covered a three hour period and I fast forwarded through most of it and through it all Candy sat in the chair and watched as Marlene took both men in all three of her holes. I did stop the fast forward at one point and watched as Marlene took one of the men in her pussy and the other in her ass. I didn't like Marlene, but I couldn't deny she had a great body and looked sexy as hell taking it in two holes. Just listening to her was as erotic as watching. She had just finished sucking one man hard while the other was over waving his cock in Candy's face and trying to get her to play and Marlene had hollered: 

"Hey, stop bothering her and get over here. I need that cock and she doesn't want it." 

The guy reluctantly left Candy and walked over to Marlene who told him to get on the bed on his back and when he did she climbed over him and lowered herself down on his stiff cock. She leaned forward, almost lying on his chest, and then said to the other guy, "Okay Stan, you know what to do." The other guy moved up behind her and pushed the head of his cock at her butt hole. 

"Easy Stan, go slow, take it easy and let me get used to it. Oh yeah, oh yeah baby, like that. Jesus that feels good. Slow baby, slow and easy, slow and easy" she moaned as he eased his way into her shitter. When he had it all in Marlene moaned, "Just hold it there baby, just hold it there and let me get used to it. Okay, slide it back, oh yes baby, like that. Now in baby, slow and easy. A little harder now, a little harder, a little faster." 

While she was doing all that moaning the man under her was pushing his cock up into her pussy. It took a couple of minutes, but the two men finally got a rhythm going and then Marlene really got vocal. 

"Oh yes, oh yes, oh sweet fucking Jesus yes. Harder, harder damn it, fuck me harder, make me cum, get me off, please get me off." 

The guy on the bottom didn't do a hell of a lot except lie there and let Marlene work her pussy on his cock as she moved back and forth on the cock in her ass. Off to the side Candy had a hand up her skirt and she was obviously fingering herself as she watched, but that was the only sexual thing she did in that room that night. 

Finally Marlene cried out, "I'm cumming, I'm cumming, oh yes, oh god yes yes yes yes YES!" and she fell forward and just laid on the bottom man's chest until the man I her ass spent himself and pulled out. The bottom man wrapped his arms around her and rolled her over on her back and then he fucked her fast and furious until he came. That was it for the two men and they got up and dressed and Marlene walked them out. 

The next section of the tape showed Candy coming into our bedroom, undressing and getting on the bed. Two minutes later a naked Marlene came into the room and go in bed with Candy. 

"I saw you girlfriend. I saw you with your hand up your skirt. When are you going to let it go? You want to or you wouldn't be stroking your pussy while watching me. You are missing out on some great sex." 

"How many times do I have to tell you Mar? Hal has two ex-wives who got to be ex-wives because they cheated on him. I love him and I don't want to be an ex- wife ergo, I don't cheat."  

===

"Well all I can say is that you are missing out on a hell of a good time. Come on baby, do me." 

My jaw damned near hit the floor as Marlene spread her legs wide and Candy moved between them and went down on her best friend. Candy slipped a finger into Marlene's pussy and Marlene pushed her ass up off the bed. Candy fingered Marlene as she lowered her mouth to her girlfriend's hairy mound and her tongue joined her fingers and then she worked on Marlene's pussy for a couple of minutes. "Aaaahhhhh" Marlene moaned as she had a small orgasm. 

"I'm cumming baby, I'm cumming." 

Candy pushed Marlene's legs wide apart and as her mouth worked on Marlene's cunt Marlene's moans became more urgent: 

"Yes, yes, oh god yes sweet baby, lick my clit, lick me, oh sweet fuck yes, I'm cumming again baby, I'm cummiNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG" she cried as her body shook with a strong climax. 

After she had settled down Marlene said, "Oh God baby, that was so damned good. You do that better than anyone else ever has." 

Candy reached over, turned of the light and the two women snuggled up together and in minutes I heard the regular breathing of people asleep. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I needed a drink and my boss had a wet bar in his office and I went down to it and got myself two inches of Black Jack and an ice cube and went back to the conference room and started the tape. The two women and three men came into the room and one of the men said: 

"Why ain't we using the room across the hall? It's got a bigger bed." 

"That's my husbands bed so we won't be using it." 

"Why the fuck not? He ain't here and he'll never know." 

"No he wouldn't" Candy said, "but I would. The bed in here is plenty big enough." 

Marlene was already stripping and the three men started undressing. Marlene was naked first and she went over and helped one guy get his pants off and then she went to work sucking his cock while he took off his shirt. When the three were naked Marlene moved to the edge of the bed and the three men followed her. Marlene was sitting on the edge of the bed and the three men were lined up in front of her with their backs to me. I saw Marlene's eyes go wide and a look of astonishment came over her face. 

"Holy shit! I don't know if I can take that. Candy, you have to look at this." 

Candy got up from her chair and walked over to stand by Marlene and I saw her eye brows go up and a look I didn't recognize come over her face. My view was still blocked by the backs of the three men, but it looked like Candy reached out to touch something and then jerked her hand back as if it had been burned. She turned and headed back to her chair, but stopped once on the way to turn back and take another look at whatever it was. 

Marlene told the one man he would have to wait until the other two had loosened her up before she would screw him and then she laid back on the bed and two of the men moved to get on it with her. The man left standing looked at the three people on the bed and then he turned to look at Candy and I saw what all the commotion was about. He had a cock the size of a horse. I would guess at it being eleven or twelve inches and very fat. The two men on the bed were already at work on Marlene, one in her pussy and one in her mouth, and Big cock turned his attention away from them and looked over at Candy sitting on the chair watching. 

Finally he walked over to her. "I know what you said at the bar, but that was before you seen this" and he waved his huge stiff cock in her face. "You want it honey, you almost took hold of it a few minutes ago. You want it and it wants you. Come on honey, join the party." 

Candy looked from his cock to his face and then back at his cock, "I...I... I can't." 

"Sure you can honey. Ain't nobody but those of us here in this room ever gonna know. Come on sugar, you want it, you know you do." 

Again Candy looked from his dick to his face and then back to his dick. "No, no, I...I...can't." 

"Come on, touch it, feel how hard it is, feel it throb and then tell me you don't want it." 

Candy seemed almost in a trance as she reached for his cock and then held it in her hand. She just sat there in the chair and held the cock and stared at it. After a few seconds the man began to rock back and forth as he fucked her hand. After thirty seconds or so he stopped and Candy looked up at him and then back down at the cock and she started stroking him on her own. One hand went down and held his ball sac as the other jerked him off. 

"Come on honey, let's stop playing around. Get naked and let's get it on." 

Candy let go of his cock and stood up. She lifted her skirt and pushed her panties down. "All right honey, I knew you would play" the man said, but the look on his face changed to one of surprise when Candy sat back down in the chair. She wrapped her panties around the end of the man's cock and went back to jacking him off. At one point she had it so close to her face staring at it that I thought she was going to take him in her mouth, but she didn't. 

Another minute and he groaned, "Here it comes honey, here it comes" and maybe thirty seconds later he pulled a limp cock out of Candy's hand and panties. By then, over on the bed the man in Marlene's pussy had cum and the man in her mouth had moved to her cunt. Big Cock went over, got on the bed and pushed his cock at Marlene's mouth. After that it was gangbang Marlene. She did manage to take all of Big Cock before they were done, but she absolutely refused to even let him try her ass. She did one triple penetration with Big Cock in her pussy and the other two men in her mouth and ass and it was a sight to behold. I decided then and there that like her or not I was going to keep that tape. 

In the background I saw Candy get up and leave the room. When Marlene had wrung the three men dry they had dressed and she had walked them out. The scene changed to Candy coming into our bedroom. She quickly undressed and grabbed a hairbrush off of her dresser and then got on the bed and used it as a dildo. What she had done with Big Cock, or the thought of the huge cock, must have had her right on the edge because she had an orgasm almost immediately. 

She got up, took a shower and then naked she got in bed and started reading. After maybe five minutes she put the book down and got up and went to the bedroom door. She opened it and started for the other room, and then stopped dead for maybe a minute and then turned around and went back and got back onto the bed and grabbed her hairbrush again. She was pounding herself furiously when Marlene came into the room and hopped on the bed with Candy just as Candy arched her back and climaxed. When she had come down from her high Marlene said: 

"What happened girlfriend? I thought tonight you were going to do it. I thought Lex really got to you." 

"He almost did. You will never know how close I came." 

"You should have baby, you missed out on a great felling. I've never been that full and that turned on at the same time. You might never have a chance at something like that again." 

"From my point of view that is a good thing. I will not cheat on Hal. I love the man and I will NOT let myself lose him." 

"It doesn't make sense Candy. Hal would never know." 

"But I would Mar, and I wouldn't be able to face him." 

"Oh well, it's your life" and she laid down on her back, spread her legs and said, "Do me baby, make me cum" and Candy did the same thing she had done the night before and she went down on Marlene. 

I shut off the TV and sat there staring at the wall. Now I knew what the detective meant when he said I'd have to make up my own mine as to whether she was cheating. Did she? Technically yes she did. The hand job was still a sex act with a man other than her husband and what she had done with Marlene on both nights was sexual interaction with another even though it wasn't a man. 

Christ, I didn't know whether to be pissed or not. Candy had made it plain on both nights that no one was going to get in her pants and she told Marlene that she loved me too much to cheat on me and take a chance on losing me. But what the hell was up with her going bar hoping with Marlene and then going along to watch? The most disturbing thing to me was the pussy munching when Marlene's lovers were gone. That bothered me; that bothered me a lot. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Candy ran to greet me when I came in the front door. She threw her arms around me, kissed me and told me how much she missed me. 

"I hope you had dinner on the plane lover, because I didn't cook for you tonight. I planned on dragging you straight up to the bedroom. If you are lucky I might leave you with enough strength to get out of bed in the morning so you can have breakfast." 

"I don't think so Candy, we need to talk. Is Marlene here?" 

"No, she's gone out." 

"Good. I'd rather not have her around for this." 

"What is it Hal, what's wrong?" 

I went into the kitchen and sat down at the table and motioned Candy to take the seat opposite me. "I had a call from Frank the other day and while he wouldn't talk about why he and Marlene split he said he would send me a package that would explain everything." 

Candy's face lost its color when she heard that. I opened my briefcase, took out the photos, the videotape and the report that he sent me and slid them across the table to Candy. 

"Suppose you read that, look at the pictures and then tell me why I shouldn't treat you the same way I treated the last two cheating whore's I married. While you are reading I'm going to go unpack and take a shower." 

I left her sitting at the table staring down at the photos and the report. It was twenty minutes before I came back down to the kitchen. Candy had been crying and when I walked into the room she wouldn't look up at me. After a minute or two of silence I said: 

"Well? What have you to say for yourself?" 

"It seems like you have already made up your mind Hal, does it really matter what I say?" 

"Not if it doesn't matter to you." 

"What does that mean?" 

"It just means that if you are willing to accept what I am thinking so be it." 

"It isn't what you think Hal." 

"Come on Candy, how could it not be what I think. Two girls go out together to a bar, pick up three guys, go to a motel room with the three guys where they stay for three hours? What am I supposed to believe, that you played Monopoly?" 

"No, but I didn't do anything with any of those men." 

"What? You telling me that you just sat there and watched Marlene play with the three of them?" 

"Yes Hal, that's all I did." 

"And I'm supposed to believe that?" 

"You probably won't, but that is the truth." 

"So what is it, you are a voyeur?" 

"No, I'm more like a body guard." 

"You will have to explain that one to me." 

"Marlene is a nymphomaniac. I know that doctors say that there is no such thing, but doctors don't know Marlene. Marlene loves multiple partners and she's had a few bad experiences when she's been alone with several guys. I go along to keep her safe." 

"I can't see two or three guys not being able to sit on you, tie you up and then do whatever they want with Marlene, or you too for that matter." 

"I have that Llama .380 that you bought me when we had that rash of break ins in the neighborhood." 

"You walk around carrying a gun in your purse?" 

"Just on the nights I go out with Marlene." 

"How in the hell did you carry it with you when you flew down to see her?" 

"I didn't have to take it with me. Marlene had her own gun, a little .32 automatic. I used that when I visited her." 

"A .32 isn't going to stop someone." 

"It makes them stop and think when it is pointed at their crotch." 

"You've done that?" 

"Twice." 

"And you expect me to believe this?" 

"Whether you believe it or not Hal, it is the truth." 

"Is that what all your trips to visit Marlene were about?" 

"Mostly." 

"And your girls nights out now that she is back up here?" 

"Yes." 

"And you maintain that you have never done anything when you were out on those little jaunts?" 

"I've been felt up several times, but I've never had sex with another man." 

"Never done anything sexual?" 

"No, well, I...I...I guess I did once." 

"What was it?" 

"I gave a guy a hand job once." 

"Why?" 

"I don't really know. I guess it was because his dick was so huge and I was curious as to how hard something that big could be. I couldn't believe he had enough blood in his body to make it hard and still leave his body enough blood to function." 

"And that's it? No other sexual activity on your nights out?" 

"No Hal, that was the only time. What are you going to do?" 

"Try and make myself believe you. Try and see if I can get by this, but my trying has a price." 

"What?" 

"I want you to sever your relationship with Marlene. I want her out of this house by Sunday and I don't want you to have anything more to do with her." 

"Oh come on Hal. She's been my best friend for over twenty-five years. I can't turn my back on her." 

"Your choice Candy. Bottom line is if she stays in your life I go. And if she goes and I stay, I stay only as long as you stay away from her. One more thing. I'm not stupid so I'm going to get myself tested for social diseases as soon as I can get an appointment and I want you to do the same. The only sex we will have will be with condoms until we both get a clean bill of health. That means for at least six months because that's how long it takes for HIV to show up." 

"Hal I swear to you I've not had sex with another man since I met you." 

"I've always believed in better safe than sorry Candy. Your story is so far out of left field that I'm going to believe that it just might - might - be true, but like I said, I'm not stupid and I'm not taking any chances. Those are my terms Candy. You either accept them or you don't." 

I got up from the table and left her there staring at my back.

Marlene found an apartment on Saturday and by Sunday afternoon she was moved into it. Candy had apparently explained my position to Marlene and a lot of tears flowed and Candy was a bear to be around for a couple of weeks. Four months went by and as far as I could tell Candy never even met Marlene for lunch or coffee. They did talk a lot on the phone, but I didn't care about that. All I required was that Candy and Marlene never go anywhere together or be alone together. 

Candy didn't like the feel of condoms so our sex life slowed down some, but other than that our relationship seemed to be as strong as it ever was before I got Frank's package. Then came the week that the company sent me out of town on business for three days. I told Candy and then I called up the detective agency I'd used earlier. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was two days before Christmas and after dinner I handed Candy a gift-wrapped box. 

"What is it?" 

"An early Christmas gift." 

She peeled off the wrapping paper and found a cardboard box. Inside there were three 10x14 manila envelopes and a videotape. The envelopes were lettered A, B, and C. 

"What is it?" 

"Start with A and then watch the video. When you are done with watching the video read B and then open C. I'll be upstairs." 

I left Candy sitting there and went up to our bedroom. A was the detective's report from my faked business trip. B was the report from the detective on the business trip I had just taken and the video of course was the one from my faked business trip. Envelope C contained the divorce papers. 

I was packing a bag when Candy came storming into the room. "You bastard! How could you do this to me?" 

"I gave you a choice Candy, me or Marlene and you picked Marlene." 

"So what? You already knew that I was telling you the truth when we had that stupid meeting in the kitchen. I told you that I just sat and watched. For Christ's sake Hal, you saw it on the video." 

"Yes Candy, but that wasn't all that I saw on the tape, was it? I saw you and the guy with the huge cock and I saw how close you came to taking it in your mouth. I saw you after you left the room go nuts with a hairbrush while you thought about that huge cock and I saw you get out of bed naked and start to go over and join Marlene and her studs. You didn't, but you almost did and I knew that if you kept running with Marlene the day was going to come when you would slip. 

"What else did I see Candy? I saw Marlene have unprotected sex with five different men and then I saw you go down on her and suck their junk out of her. You don't have to fuck to get VD Candy, you can get just as easily from sucking a cock or eating a cum filled pussy. As much fucking as the little whore does she could already have been diseased before that video was even made. Every time you ate her pussy Candy you took a chance on getting something and bringing it home to me. That was the reason for the condoms and the testing, to make sure that you hadn't already gotten something and passed it along to me. That was another reason for me wanting you to stay away from Marlene, so you wouldn't pick up something if you turned out to be clean. 

I gave you a chance Candy. All you had to do was stay away from Marlene, but did you? I left you alone for three nights Candy, and what did you do? You went bar hoping with Marlene and then to a motel on all three nights. You made your choice Candy, and it wasn't me. Now if you don't mind I'd like to finish packing." 

"You're going to go? You're really going to leave me?" 

"Yes." 

She stormed out of the room and minutes later I heard a loud crash and the sound of breaking glass. A door slammed, I heard the garage door opener start to operate and then there was silence as I continued to pack. Report_Story
