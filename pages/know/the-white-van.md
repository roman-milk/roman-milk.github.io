It was a chance remark that started it all. I had just walked off the elevator at work as Charlie was saying to Mel: 

".....Becca and Phil if they can make it." 

Then they saw me and said, "Good morning Rob" and then the two of them headed for their desks. As I walked into my office I was wondering if it was my wife Becca that they were talking about and if it was why would she be "making" something with Phil? That overheard remark made me uneasy. In fact it downright disturbed me. 

I sat down, turned on the computer and brought up the program I had been working with the last couple of days, but as I stared at the screen it wasn't work that was on my mind. I was remembering the last company Christmas party. I'm not much on dancing when we go out, other than country western, and Becca loves to dance so it is not unusual for her to dance a third of the dances with me and the other two thirds with anyone who asks her. 

The last company party was no exception and while she did dance with several others I did notice that she danced quite a few dances with Phil. I commented on it on the drive home. A trace of a smile passed quickly over her face and then was gone. I expected her to say something like, "Why Rob Daltry; I do believe that you are jealous" or something like that and pass it off, but she didn't. What she said was: 

"He was a better dancer than any of the rest of them so yes, I did dance more with him than anyone else." 

I couldn't press it without getting into territory I knew I should stay clear of, but what I knew about Phil was that he was a cock hound; the kind of guy who drew comments like "He would fuck a snake if some one would hold it's head" and I wasn't all that happy that Becca had spent so much time with him. A little irrational of me perhaps since I was there and had my eye on them and Becca had never given me any reason to doubt her, but I just did not trust Phil at all. I shook it off and got to work. It couldn't have been my Becca they were talking about since the only place she could come in contact with Phil would be at company events and the next one was the company picnic and that was still months away. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

As I drove home that night I thought about what I would fix myself for dinner. It was Becca's card night so I would be on my own. Becca was an avid bridge player and I couldn't stand the game. I liked to play cards, but I just could not get into bridge, Becca belonged to a group that played every Wednesday night and that is why I would be cooking for myself. 

There was plenty of food in the house, but after looking at the possibilities and finding nothing that appealed to me I decided to pamper myself and go out to eat. I settled on the Olive Garden and I was working on my salad when I saw Bill and Helen Winters come in. I thought it odd since Helen was part of the group that met to play bridge, but then I guessed that everyone needed a night off sometimes. They noticed me and waved and I waved back. They joined a couple at a table and I got involved with my veal scaloppini. 

When I got home I turned on the TV and watched for a while and then I headed off to bed. I took the book I'd been reading off of the nightstand, propped myself up with some pillows and then read till I got sleepy. 

In the morning I got up and showered even though I knew it would piss Becca off. I would wake up half an hour earlier than she needed to get up and the shower would wake her and she would always be grumpy with me over it. I would just shrug and tell her to get home earlier from her card game and she wouldn't have such a short nights sleep. 

I was in the kitchen having my first cup of coffee and paging through the morning paper when Becca came into the kitchen. She poured herself a cup of coffee and sat down opposite me. I put down the paper and said: 

"Have a good night at cards?" 

"God no and in fact I'm almost sorry that I went." 

"I thought you loved bridge?" 

"I do, but last night I was paired with Helen Winters and she is the worst bridge player I have ever seen. She made so many boneheaded blunders that I wanted to crawl across the table and strangle her." 

Suddenly I was having bad thoughts. I was having some very, very bad thoughts." 

"Helen Winters? I've not heard you complaining about her before." 

"That's probably because she never upset me before like she did last night." 

I finished my coffee and got up and as I put my cup in the sink I said, "I guess you will just have to hope you don't get paired with her too often." 

The obvious question in my mind as I drove to work was where was Becca last night? She obviously wasn't playing cards with Helen Winters. It ate at me all day and by four in the afternoon I decided to take a gamble and I called Helen. 

"Hello?" 

"Helen, this is Rob Daltry. I'm sorry to bother you, but something has been bugging me and before I confront Becca about it I decided that I should prepare myself with some information." 

"On what?" 

"What happened with the Wednesday night bridge group?" 

"We ran out of players. Marge Holbrook left Dan and ran off with a truck driver. Bev Marshall got married and her husband moved her to Jamesville and Mary Ellen found out that her husband was using her card night to play around with one of the filing clerks where he works so she quit. We just didn't have enough people to play. Why?" 

"Becca just seems to get bent all out of shape every Wednesday and she gets majorly bitchy with me. I've had enough of it and I'm trying to line my ducks up in a row before I have a sit down with her over it." 

"You would think that after three months she would be over it. My God, it is only a card game." 

"My thoughts exactly. Thanks Helen. Take care." 

Three months? Three fucking months? Where the fuck had Becca been going every Wednesday for the last three months? 

And what the fuck had she been doing? And almost like it was the answer to those questions came the memory of "....Becca and Phil if they can make it." Something was sure enough rotten in Denmark, but I was going to want a lot more information before I confronted Becca on things. I was going to have to wait for the next Wednesday to get answers, but answers I would get and God help Phil and my wife if what I was starting to think was true. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Rebecca Anne Porter had been a part of my life since the ninth grade. Becca was the first girl I ever dated and the first girl I ever kissed. We dated off and on through the tenth grade. It was off and on because her parents wouldn't let her have a steady boyfriend until she was in the eleventh grade. 

On the first day of classes when we started the eleventh grade I asked Becca to go steady and she said yes. We went steady for about four months and then one day just before the Christmas break she gave me back my letter sweater and told me she was breaking up with me. There was a guy who had just transferred in from out of state, he had asked her out and she wanted to go out with him. Without a word I turned and walked away as she called out "Wait Rob, wait." 

I was upset. No, I was mightily pissed and my attitude became, "Okay, you want to date another guy? Well that works both ways." I ignored Becca and whatever she was doing and for the next six months I dated at least a half a dozen girls. A couple of times I was at parties or events and Becca was there also, but I made sure to avoid her. A couple of times I saw her head my way and I pointedly turned my back and moved away. 

Summer came and I got a job working for a landscaper and a couple of times when I got home from work my mom told me that Becca had called and wanted me to call her back, but I never did. Did I want to? Yes I did. I missed her terribly, but pride kept me from picking up the phone and dialing her number. She had dumped me so fuck her and the horse she rode in on. What can I say? When you are a teenager and getting used to girls you are allowed and probably even expected to be stupid. 

School started two weeks before Labor Day and on the first day of class for my senior year I was sitting in Mr. Patterson's room waiting for class to start when Becca took the seat next to me. I glanced quickly around the room, but there were no empty seats that I could get up and move to. Becca saw me do it and said: 

"No way to get away from me Rob unless you want to skip class, but if you do that you are going to have to skip a lot of classes because I'm going to have the seat next to you in every class we have together." 

"Why? Why bother?" 

"Because I want to get back on good terms with you. Because I miss you. Because we had something nice and I miss it." 

"You miss it? You're the one who threw what we had away." 

"I didn't throw anything away Rob; you just took it wrong." 

"Wrong? You gave me back my letter sweater, told me that you didn't want to go steady with me any more and I was wrong?" 

"You walked away before I could explain." 

"Explain what?" 

"I didn't want to stop seeing you Rob; I just wanted to date other guys too and I couldn't do it if we were a known steady couple. I still wanted to date you." 

"So? That's what you wanted. It wasn't what I wanted so that hardly means that I took it wrong. You dumped me Becca. You dumped me for some dickhead who moved here from out of town. I didn't get that part wrong." 

Then I heard, "Mr. Daltry; if you and Ms. Porter could hold it down we can get on with class." 

I looked around and saw Mr. Patterson and everyone else in the class looking at us. After class was over Becca stuck to me like glue and followed me down the hall. And just before I went into Mrs. Osbourne's room Becca said: 

"Meet me in the cafeteria at lunch time. Please Rob? If after lunch you still don't want to have anything to do with me I'll leave you alone." 

"Maybe" I said as I walked into the classroom. As Mrs. Osbourne droned on about what she expected of us I was thinking about Becca and I decided to meet her at lunch and see what she had to say. When I got to the cafeteria Becca had already staked out a table and twice while I was going through the line I saw friends of hers walk up to the table and start to sit, but Becca said something and they moved away. 

As soon as I sat down Becca went right at it. "Rob honey, I like you more than any other guy I've dated, but we are both young yet and don't have a clue where life is going. I've watched my parent's friends as couple after couple break up and get divorced. I've promised myself that it is never going to happen to me. I'm going to get the right guy and do it right the first time. That means that I have to meet different guys, date different ones, see what is out there, and learn about them so I can make informed judgments. 

"And it isn't just me Rob. You should be doing it too. Right now you think that I'm the one for you, but do you really know? Have you gone out with other girls so you could have a basis for comparing? I know you have dated other girls, but you have never stayed with any of them long enough to get to know them. Gail was the one you were with the longest, but it was only three dates so you really didn't get to know her all that well did you." 

She must have been keeping a closer eye on me than I'd kept on her if she knew just how many dates I'd had with any one girl. 

"So just what is it you are saying here Becca." 

"That I want to spend some time with you, but I don't want it to be an exclusive thing. We both need to see other people." 

I didn't know what to say so I just sat there looking at her in silence. I don't know what she thought I was thinking, but after sitting there and looking at me for several moments she said: 

"You will get all the good ones Rob. You will get Labor Day Weekend, the county fair and the senior prom, but I want to be free to say yes if someone interesting asks me out. I will never break a date with you to go out with someone else, but I can't say yes if I'm going steady." 

I sat there silent for several more seconds and then said, "It won't work Becca. You just said it yourself. You told me three dates with Gail wasn't enough time to really get to know her. How many dates would it take to really get to know someone? Ten? Fifteen? Twenty? Let's use ten. Ten dates, since your parents only let you date weekends, would take three months. That's three months I wouldn't see you and don't tell me that you would date me at the same time you were dating the other guy. It wouldn't work and you know it. Say you dated him on a Friday and he asked to see you again Saturday and you said no, that you already had a date with me for that night. You think he is going to hang around for three or more months for you to go out on ten dates with him so you can get to know him better while you are alternating dates between him and me? And what if in the middle of all that you meet another interesting guy? No Becca, that just won't work for me." 

I got up and headed for my next class. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

What Becca had said did touch a chord in me. It was true that I hadn't really taken the time to get to know any of the other girls I dated. I dated, had fun and then asked another girl out. I didn't spend a lot of time on other girls because Becca was the one that I wanted. It finally got through to me that with Becca I was only ever going to be one of many and if I couldn't handle that I needed to start seeing what else was out there. 

Labor Day came and went and I never called Becca. She called the house and left a message the week before the county fair, but I never returned the call. I dated a couple of girls, but after a couple of dates it was obvious that while we liked each other nothing was going to come of it. 

My eighteenth birthday was on the twenty-ninth of October and my parents surprised me by giving me a car for a birthday present. That freed me up to date more often and having a car made me a little more appealing to some of the girls and I started getting more dates. It wasn't until my fourth date with Pauline French that life got interesting. The first two were nothing out of the ordinary. I did get kissed goodnight and on the third we made out hot and heavy and I was definitely hoping for more. 

The fourth we went to the Burger Barn for burgers and fries and then went and played miniature golf. We had just finished the last hole and I asked Pauline what she would like to do next. She looked me right in the eye and asked: 

"Do you eat pussy Rob?" 

It was one of those moments when you know that the wrong answer was going to be life changing. The honest answer would have been no, but there was more to it than that. The fact of the matter was that I was a virgin. I'd had my mouth on a breast or two and I'd had my fingers in a pussy or three (mostly Becca). I'd gotten a hand job twice (and not from Becca), but that was the extent of my sexual experience. A no answer would probably mean no more dates with Pauline and a yes answer, if she wanted a demonstration, would show me to be a liar and would probably mean no more dates with Pauline. And Pauline was one hot looking babe. I gave the only answer that I thought could save the day. 

"I haven't yet, but I've always wanted to try it." 

It was an answer that saved me the embarrassment of admitting that I was still cherry. Pauline looked at me for a second and then said: 

"Here's the deal. I'm a virgin and I plan to stay one until I get married, but I like orgasms. Guys love to have their dicks sucked, but most are unwilling to return the favor. If you are willing to date me knowing that you are never going to go all the way I will suck your cock as long as you eat my pussy. What do you think?" 

To say I was stunned would be an understatement. I had no idea that Pauline was like that. Let's face it. Guys talk and a dozen guys had dated Pauline and not one of them had ever said anything about Pauline that would have led me to expect something like that from her. I was still standing there with my mouth hanging open when she said: 

"Well Rob; how about it?" 

"I guess, umm, I mean yeah, sure." 

"Okay then; drive us out to Steven's Point." 

When we got to the point we got on the back seat and she pulled up her skirt and pulled off her panties and then said, "You first." Pauline had obviously done it before because she started leading me through it step by step. I was nervous as hell and half afraid I was going to barf, but I dug in and found that it didn't bother me. She told me where to touch, what to rub, how to lick it and suck on her clit. I must have been doing something right because she was crying "Yes, oh yes" and her body was shaking. 

I have no idea how long I was down there before she pushed me away and said, "Your turn now." I won't even try to describe my first blow job other than to say I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. When I took her home she asked "Tomorrow?" and I of course said yes. 

For the next three weeks Pauline and I went out three or four times a week and every date ended up out at Stevens Point. At the end of those three weeks I found out that girls talk too. It was a Monday morning and I was just coming out of Mrs. Osborne's class when Becca stepped up in front of me, said: 

"You bastard!" and slapped my face. "I know what you have been doing with Pauline French." 

"So? What business is it of yours?" 

"It is supposed to be me damn you." 

Now bear in mind that I hadn't spoke to Becca since our talk in the cafeteria some months back. I'd seen her around, but I hadn't spoken to her and if it looked like she was going to head my way I turned and beat feet in the other direction so to have her in my face bitching about what I was doing with Pauline made no sense to me. 

"You are out of your mind Becca. You are the one who pushed me away so where the hell do you get off?" 

"You are supposed to be mine Rob. I explained it all to you." 

"And I told you I wasn't going to have anything to do with what you wanted. I am not yours Becca and I haven't been yours since you broke up with me. Now unless you plan on beating me some more I have a class to get to." 

"I want us back together Rob." 

"A little late for that Becca. I'm with Pauline now and we are getting along just fine." 

"But she doesn't love you Rob; she's just using you because you are the only one who will do what she likes. She is already talking about how hard it is going to be to find someone to take your place when she goes off to college." 

That wasn't ground breaking news since I had known that all along. That she was going off to college I mean. I was too, but she was going back east to Smith and I would be going to a college closer to home. I also knew that even if Pauline and I went to the same college we were not destined for a life together. Becca was right in that Pauline was using me to get what she wanted, but I was using Pauline to get the same and all of a sudden I was supposed to give it up because Becca wanted to get back together? I didn't think so. 

I would have loved to have Becca back and to have things back the way they were before she broke us up, but I didn't think I could trust her not to want to go out with other guys if she found one she thought she might be interested in. I'd never forget the how and why she had broken up with me in the first place so I just shrugged and said: 

"That might be so Becca, but until she leaves we are a couple. Got to go or I'll be late for class." 

I walked off and left her standing there. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Never underestimate the power of the female fraternity. It was two days after being slapped by Becca and Pauline and I had just finished a very satisfying sixty-nine. I was feeling all warm and fuzzy in the afterglow of my orgasm when Pauline said: 

"I had a talk with your old girlfriend yesterday."  

===

"Oh?" 

"She asked me to drop you so she could get you back." 

"And you said?" 

"I told her I would think about it." 

"And just what is your thinking on the idea?" 

"In four months we graduate and I'll be gone anyway so I'm thinking "Why not." Who knows; I may need a favor from her some day." 

"Anyone stop to think that if you drop me I won't go back to her anyway?" 

"Why wouldn't you? She's good looking and she obviously cares for you." 

"Just not enough." 

I told Pauline about why we broke up in the first place and then said, "I don't trust her not to do it again. And anyway, why would I want to go back to fighting her just to try and get my hands on her boobs after what I've had with you. No thanks. If you drop me I'll just go looking for another girl like you." 

"You won't find one sweetie; I'm one of a kind, but you could maybe make yourself one." 

"Make myself one?" 

"She wants you back pretty bad and that kind of puts you in the driver's seat. Tell her you are going to look for someone who will do what I do and see if she will agree to it to get you back. There may even be a bonus in it for you." 

"What kind of bonus?" 

"Prom is in three months and a lot of girls give up their 'pearl of great price' on prom night. You already know it isn't going to happen with me, but you may be able to make it happen with her." 

"You are sounding like you have decided to do it and are trying to convince me I'm going to come out of it all right." 

"Well sweetie, to be honest about it I have decided to do what she asked." 

I stood up and reached for my pants and Pauline said, "What ere you doing?" 

"You just told me that we're through. I'm getting dressed to leave." 

"Whoa up there cowboy. I didn't say it would be tonight or even this week. I just need to do it in time for you to ask her to the prom. Say maybe a month or six weeks before." 

"I guess that means that we aren't going to the prom." 

"In the first place sweetie you haven't asked me and if you had my answer would have been "Sorry, but my parents are taking me back east the week of the prom." 

"I stood there, pants in hand, undecided as to what to do and then Pauline said: 

"Get back over here sweetie and let me blow on your trumpet for a while." 

I dropped my pants on the floor and got back on the bed with Pauline. 

++++++++++++++++ 

Pauline cut me loose seven weeks before the prom and the first thing I did was make a list of the girls that the other guys said were 'easy.' Two days after my 'release' I called Debbie Walling. I took her out three times and found out that the rumors about her were bullshit. Next on the list was Stella Felter. Another girl the target of bullshit rumors. Before I could call Gail Luoma, another name on the list of "sure things" I got a call from Becca. 

"What are you doing Rob? Why are you dating Debbie and Stella? You need to be with me Rob." 

"I think we have had this conversation before Becca." 

"I want us back together Rob." 

"I don't think so Becca. I need a girl like Pauline. I got very used to what we had going for us and I'm looking for a girl who can pick up where Pauline left off." 

"I'll do whatever I have to do to get us back together." 

"I seriously doubt that Becca. I remember how much I had to fight just to get a hand under your sweater." 

"I mean it Rob. I will do whatever I have to do to get us back together." 

+++++++++++++++++ 

She wasn't as good as Pauline, but then Pauline had gotten plenty of practice and Becca did get better with each date. Becca did come every bit as unglued as Pauline when I ate her pussy, but the steel curtain came down when I tried to have intercourse with her. 

"Pauline didn't do that. She said the reason she did what she did was so she could stay a virgin." 

I lied and said, "That doesn't mean anything. She promised me that she would give me her cherry at the prom." 

"Maybe I will at the prom, but not now." 

"What's the difference; then or now?" 

"I'm not ready Rob. Maybe prom night. And I'm only saying maybe." 

Becca did give it up on prom night and after that there was no turning back. Becca and I were a steady couple for the rest of high school and all four years of college and never once did she date or tell me she wanted to date other guys. We were married three months after finishing our degree programs and the next eleven years were among the best of my life. I had thought that our marriage -- that we -- were rock solid and now I wasn't so sure. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Wednesday I was parked in a rental car where I could see Becca's car in her company parking lot. She came out at five after five and when she pulled out of the parking lot I followed her. She drove to the other side of town and pulled up in front of a ranch style house on Beacon Street. I pulled over and parked and watched her get out of her car, walk up and enter the house. She didn't knock or ring a bell; she just opened the door and walked right in. 

I sat there watching and five minutes later Charlie pulled up and got out of his car with a woman who wasn't his wife. Next came Mel and his lovely wife Judy followed by another two couples I didn't recognize. The next arrival was the one I hoped I wouldn't see. Phil pulled up, parked and went into the house. Two more couples showed up and they appeared to be the last. 

By the time the last couples had shown it was starting to get dark out. I waited another thirty minutes and then I got out of the rental and approached the house. I hoped that there weren't any nosey neighbors looking out their windows as I made my way around the house that everyone had entered. I finally found a window where the blinds had a gap in them and I peeked in and saw a sight I had never seen before. 

It was a full-blown orgy. 

Mel's wife was being fucked by Charlie. The woman Charlie had come with had two guys working on her. She was on her hands and knees with her mouth on the man standing in front of her and the other guy was nailing her from behind. Another woman was riding a guy cowgirl while a man stood next to her and watched while he stroked himself, but I didn't see Becca in the room. 

I moved on around looking for another place where I could see in. I came to a gate and slowly opened it and walked into the back yard. The back yard had a six foot privacy fence around it so the owner's must not have felt the need for drapes or blinds. I could stand off to the side and look in through the sliding glass patio door and into what seemed to be the family room of the house. And in that room was the worthless cunt that I was married to. Phil was in her ass, Mel was in her pussy and some guy I didn't know had his cock in her mouth. Another woman and two men were standing there watching. I turned away sickened by the sight. Before I reached the gate I barfed on the side of the house. 

I made my way back to the rental, drove it back to the rental place and then went on home. As I drove home I contemplated what I was going to do. I came up with a dozen ideas and I had to discard all of them because any one of them would have put me in jail for a very long time. One would have gotten me the death penalty. I needed a way to make four people pay, but would leave me enjoying my freedom. Phil, Mel and Charlie would be fairly easy to get to since they all worked for me. I couldn't fire them, at least not for what they were doing to me, but I would find a way to get to them. Becca would take some thought. 

I got home, made myself a pretty stiff drink and then settled down on the couch to watch some TV. I was watching something, I'm not sure what it was, but it showed a group of Hell's Angels on a motorcycle run to somewhere and as I looked at them an idea began forming in my mind. 

I was in bed pretending to be asleep when Becca got home. She took a quick shower -- she always claimed it was for my benefit because five of the card players smoked and she didn't want me to smell the stink on her -- and then she crawled into bed and snuggled up next to me. I lay there wondering at the affection she showed me after what she had just been doing. I was still wondering as I slipped into sleep. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day I started making phone calls and gathering information. Using the information I gathered I made more phone calls and Friday I met a man for lunch and we did a deal. Friday night when I got home from work I told Becca to put on her dancing shoes because we were going to go to the Golden Spur for some good old country western dancing. 

At the Spur I nursed one drink while getting a good half dozen doubles into Becca. We danced and had a good time and around midnight I told Becca that it was time to go. Becca whined that she still felt like partying. 

"Maybe again tomorrow baby, but I've had a long day and I'm beat." 

Once in the parking lot I walked her to the car and as we got to a white van parked next to us a man got out and said: 

"Is this her?" 

"Indeed it is." 

He took an envelope out of his pocket and handed it to me. "You want to count it?" 

"No need." 

He turned and opened the side door on the van and there were five guys sitting in it. Two of them jumped out and grabbed Becca and hauled her into the van as she cried out: 

"What the hell is going on here? What the fuck are you doing?" 

As a rag was stuffed in her mouth I said, "You said you still felt like partying so enjoy." 

Marcus closed the door of the van and I said, "Remember; no visible marks." 

"No problem. When do you want to do the other part?" 

"See how this goes. If it goes right maybe in two weeks." 

He got in the van and drove off. Becca liked multiple partners? She was going to have a weekend full of them. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Saturday I slept in and then went out and played eighteen holes. I went out for dinner, caught a movie and then went to bed fairly early. Sunday I worked around the house and around six I got a phone call. I opened the garage door and about five minutes later the white van pulled in and I closed the door behind it. Marcus got out of the van and I asked: 

"How did it go?" 

"She was reluctant at first, but by the third one she decided that since it was going to happen anyway she might as well go with the flow. Thirty-one and most more than once if you are interested." 

"And the film?" 

"I had five cameras running. I'll get it all transferred onto CDs and get them to you sometime later in the week." 

He opened the side door of the van and I saw Becca passed out on the floor. I don't think there was an inch of her that didn't have dried cum on it. Marcus saw me looking and said: 

"She was almost passed out there at the end and a half dozen guys whacked off and shot all over her. She's pretty tired; she didn't get any sleep until I loaded her into the van." 

He helped me carry her into the house and up the stairs and we dumped her on the bed in the spare bedroom. We shook hands and he said: 

"I know the plan, but if she pisses you off again before then make sure and let me know. The guys really enjoyed her." 

I opened the door and he backed the van out and I closed the door and went to watch some TV. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Becca was still asleep when I went to work in the morning. I smiled and said "Good morning" to Phil, Mel and Charlie the same as I did every day of the week. Let them think I was the clueless husband. That would make my getting them easier. I spent part of the day on the Internet getting information that I would hopefully put to good use. 

When I got home that evening and walked through the connecting door into the garage I saw Becca at the sink and she looked pretty ragged. She must have called in sick or I would have beaten her home. She turned and screamed "You bastard!" and threw a dish at me. I ducked it and it smashed into the wall behind me. I moved quickly to her and grabbed her arms. 

"You mother fucker! How could you do that to me?" 

"It was easy once I found out how you really spend your Wednesday nights." 

I saw fear come over her face and she struggled to get loose. I forced her down on a chair and she said: 

"What are you going to do?" 

"That will depend on what you do. You do what I want and we might get by this. You don't do what I want and you are out of here on your ass." 

"I don't want that. I love you Rob; I really do." 

"Don't give me any of that shit. No way you could love me and do what you have been doing. How the fuck do you think I felt when I found out you were fucking the guys I work with? The same guys that smile at me and wish me a good morning while they are laughing at Becca's clueless husband behind his back. But what really pisses me off is that while I'm sitting at the goddamned computer reading about this shit and wishing I could do it you are out doing it behind my back." 

"You? You would do that?" 

"Damned right I would. This is what is going to happen Becca. Not this Wednesday, but a week from this Wednesday you are going to have your little party right here in this house. I don't care what you have to do to make it happen, but you make it happen or you are out of here on your ass and you will not let anyone know that I know. Do you understand what I'm saying? 

"Yes. I think, but how am I supposed to get them to come here?" 

"I will set it up so that Phil, Mel and Charlie think I'm going out of town to take care of some things that came up concerning my father's estate. Tell them that you want to do it on your own bed. Lead them on. Ask them if they wouldn't like to fuck Rob's wife on Rob's bed. The bastards will probably jump at the chance. Once it gets going I'm going to walk in on it and I want to see those assholes faces when I strip and fuck Mel's wife in her asshole. 

"Until then you are in the spare bedroom. Whether or not you make it back into the bedroom with me will depend on how you do what I told you and on the long talk I have with my ass wipe co-workers when it is over and done with. I'm going to get their version of what happened and how and then I'm going to compare it with what you tell me. After that I'll decided whether we have a future or not. I meant it Becca; Phil and the boys are not -- I repeat not! - - to know that I have found out about your fuck sessions. If I get any inkling that they know I'll know you clued them in and you are out of here. Now where's my fucking dinner." 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

Becca was wise enough to not speak unless spoken to the rest of that day and all day Tuesday, but Wednesday morning she asked: 

"What do you want me to do tonight?" 

"I guess you need to go if you are going to talk them into being here next Wednesday. Just remember what I said about anyone finding out that I am no longer clueless about what you are doing." 

Wednesday morning Marcus called me at work and we met for lunch and he gave me the two CDs he had made of Becca's weekend and we discussed the next part of my plan. 

I was awake when she got home. But my bedroom door was closed so she took her shower and went into the spare bedroom. In the morning she said: 

"You were right. They jumped at the chance to do me on your bed and in your house. Actually, since they think you will be gone all week they wanted to come over every night, but I told them no." 

"Just out of curiosity if I didn't know about you and them and I was really going out of town all week would you have them over every night?" 

"Probably." 

"You love me. You really, really love me; isn't that what you told me? And yet you would fuck three of my co-workers in my house and on my bed everyday I was gone? And you wonder why I don't believe you when you say that you love me?" 

"It has nothing to do with love Rob. It is just sex. Absolutely wild pure assed sex. Once a week I let myself go crazy and be an absolute slut. It fills a need in me and it hasn't hurt you in the least. You were never supposed to find out." 

"I guess now is as good a time as any for this so tell me how and why did this start." 

"It got its start at your last company Christmas party. I was dancing with Phil and he came right out and said: 

"You are sexy as hell Becca and I want to fuck you." 

"I had been drinking as you know and I was in a pretty good mood. I was a little shocked at what he'd come right out and said, but I played along and said: 

"Are you any good?" 

"I've not had any complaints." 

"I smiled at him and asked him if he had any rave reviews and he said he had a couple. Then I asked him how big his cock was and he said it was big enough to get the job done and I said "Show me." He told me to meet him over near the restrooms in five minutes and he would. Just out of curiosity to see if he would actually do it I met him and he pulled me into the men's room and locked the door behind us. He took his cock out and I looked at it and told him it was a nice one, but smaller than what I was used to. I told him that because he wasn't as big as you. He asked me if I was going to give him a chance to show what he could do with it and I told him that maybe I would, but I'd have to think on it for a bit and then I unlocked the door and left. 

"I thought that would be the end of it and I almost told you what happened so we could both get a laugh out of it, but then I thought it would be best not to say anything. For one thing I wasn't sure things would turn out good if you went into work and went after Phil. For another I worried that you might be pissed over me letting it go as far as it did. I knew I wouldn't see Phil again until the company picnic in the summer so I forgot all about it. 

"A couple of months later I showed up at Helen's for bridge and found that we didn't have enough players and in fact Helen said we would probably have to disband the group if we couldn't find any new players and that is what happened. But that night you were in Denver on a business trip and I didn't feel like going home and facing an empty house so I stopped at Bud's Bar for a drink after I left Helen's. 

"I was half way through the drink when Phil slid onto the seat next to me. He asked me if I was ready for another drink and I said yes. We sat and talked in general through a couple more drinks and then Phil said: 

"You've had plenty of time to think about it so what do you say?" 

"I asked about what and he said, "What we talked about at the Christmas party. I really would like to fuck you." 

"I thought about it for maybe a minute and then said, "Okay; let's do it." 

"It was a combination of the drinks and my curiosity about his confidence and the way he just went after what he wanted and didn't worry about getting his face slapped or me running to you and telling. Maybe there was some curiosity about whether he was as good as he seemed to think he was and I guess you could throw in a pinch of horniness or lust, but I went to his apartment with him and ended up staying the night." 

"And?" 

"He was good. He had a lot of staying power and was quick to recover. He was like the Energizer Bunny -- he just kept on going and going -- and before you even ask, yes I did enjoy it. In the morning he asked if we could do it again and I told him I didn't think so, but he gave me his cell number and told me to give him a call if I changed my mind. The next Wednesday I called Helen and she said that the bridge group was gone. I remembered the hard fucking I got from Phil and you weren't expecting me home anyway so I called him. He was just as good that night so I told him I'd see him the next Wednesday. 

"He was doing me when Mel walked in. Phil told me he'd told Mel how hot I was and Mel had said that he wanted a taste. Phil finished and I tried to get up and leave, but Phil held me down while Mel took me. Then Phil pushed his cock in my mouth and they both used me. I liked it. No, that isn't true -- I loved it. They didn't care what I wanted only what they wanted. They took me over and over and I had some screaming orgasms. There was another week of Mel and Phil and then Mel and Phil took me to a swinger's party and after that it was a group grope every Wednesday. Two of the group hard fairly large cocks and I discovered that I was a size queen. I just couldn't get enough of the full feeling I got when Stan and Russ took me."  

===

"What about me Becca? How did you think I was going to feel about it when I found out?" 

"I never worried about that because you were never going to know. I was very careful not to do anything that would clue you in." 

"Cheaters always get caught Becca. It does matter what you did to hide it. You couldn't control what others do. The first slip was me overhearing something Mel and Charlie said in the office that I wasn't supposed to hear and that got me to thinking, but what really killed it for you was instead of staying home and fixing myself dinner one night I decided to go out and eat and guess who was in the restaurant I went to. Helen and her husband and the next morning you told me how bad a night you'd had because you got stuck with Helen for a partner." 

I stared at her for several seconds and then said, "Phil wasn't the first, was he?" 

Becca looked away from me and I said, "How many and for how long?" 

Still not looking at me she said "Maybe six over the last five years." 

"You sit there and tell me that you love me, but you have been fucking over me for over five years. You have some strange idea of what love is Becca." 

"I do love you. I can't help it if I like sex. I can't help it if my pussy tingles when I meet an interesting man and I just have to see how he is. I'm always here for you. I've never wanted any of the others other than for a one night or one week stand. It was just sex Rob. There was no love involved. There wasn't any affection involved. I got to be a wild slut every once in a while and I liked it." 

"Have you done anyone I know?" 

"No. The only ones you know are Phil, Mel and Charlie." 

"I don't know who I should be the most pissed at. You for what you've done or me for stupidly loving you, trusting you, and not being smart enough to pick up on what you were doing." 

"I'm sorry honey. I love you, I really do, but the slut in me comes out when I meet an interesting guy and he makes my pussy wet. It was just sex honey. Honest to God it never had anything to do with my love for you. You are the only one I love." 

"Just not enough to leave other cocks alone." 

She looked away and I got up and went to work. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I called every one into the office and told them I would be out of town the following week because I had to fly back to Michigan to take care of some matters pertaining to my father's estate. 

"While I'm gone Phil will be in charge." 

The pump having been primed I got to work. 

I was used to having sex four or five times a week with Becca, but I hadn't touched her since I saw her being three-holed through the window on the night I had followed her. I was hurting and Becca was aware of how long it had been since I had touched her and she knew how I would be feeling. She set out to try and get me back into bed with her. She dressed skimpily, let me see her nude and even left her bedroom door open and masturbated so I could see, but I ignored her. I finally told her to stop it and that I was not going to have anything to do with her until after Wednesday and my talk with Phil, Mel and Charlie. 

Monday I worked around the house and when Becca got home from work I had dinner ready and I did the same thing on Tuesday. Just before Becca left for work on Wednesday I asked: 

"How long should I give you before I walk in? I want to make sure that things are well underway before I come in." 

"It will start at six-thirty so give it about an hour." She was silent for a second and then she said, "Are we going to be all right baby?" 

"We will just have to see Becca." 

That evening I was parked just up the street and I watched until all the players were there and then I took off, had dinner at the Olive Garden and then took in a movie. The house was dark and quiet when I got home. Becca was fucked out and asleep on the couch. She had cum on her face, in her hair, on her breasts and her cunt hair was matted. She hadn't cleaned the place up and there were cum stains on the rug and on the leather couch. The beds in my room and her room were torn up and the sheets were wet with cum. It must have been one hell of a party. 

I went down into the basement and checked the recorders and it appeared that all the spy cams I'd installed had worked. I smiled and went back upstairs. I changed the sheets and pillow cases on my bed and then I carried Becca up and dumped her on hers and then I went to bed and slept like a baby. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I was sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee and reading the morning paper when Becca came into the room. I stood up and took her in my arms. I hugged her and kissed her and then said: 

"I'm sorry baby; I meant to be here, but I got into some trouble." 

"What kind of trouble?" 

"I went to a bar and had a couple of drinks to get my nerve up for what I was going to do and some loudmouth started pushing me around and I beat the shit out of him. The cops took me down to the jail and held me for about six hours until they had interviewed all the witnesses. The witnesses confirmed that the loudmouth had started it all and that I had only acted in self defense. I couldn't call you because I was supposed to be out of town. I hoped that they would turn me loose in time for me to come to the party, but it didn't happen." 

"What now?" 

"Next week I go with you to the party." 

"I don't think I can go another week like the last two. I love you honey. I love you and I need you." 

"Don't sweat it baby; you did what I told you to do. It isn't your fault that my plan didn't work the way I wanted it to. Tomorrow we will go out and celebrate our new start. I'm not going to make love to you until we get home. I want my first time back inside you to be good and that means we have to give your love box a chance to close up. I know it must be a little loose after last night and I'd like for you to be a little tighter for me. Okay?" 

"Whatever you want honey; as long as I've got you back." 

When she left for work I got busy with the product of the spy cams and condensed all of the footage on a CD and then I started burning copies. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Friday night we went to the Golden Spur and danced and drank and had a good time. I rubbed her tits and pussy every chance I got and Becca was red hot by the time I told her it was time to go. 

She got in the car and slid over next to me and reached for my zipper and when I didn't stop her she smiled and took me in her mouth. It had been a while for me and I came quickly and she swallowed it all and kept me in her mouth to work at getting me back up again. She was working hard on me and didn't notice when I pulled up next to the white van. She screamed when the door opened and hands pulled her off of me and hustled her into the van. Marcus handed me another envelope and I said: 

"We will do the next part Monday. Think you can be ready by then? 

"I'm ready now. I've just been waiting for you to say go." 

Saturday and Sunday were spent working around the house. I removed the spy cams and recording equipment and all traces of Becca's Wednesday night sex party and I even managed to get in eighteen holes on both days. I got a phone call from Marcus around seven Sunday night and all he said was: 

"It's done. See you Monday." 

Monday I asked Phil to stop and have a drink or two with me after work. 

"I'm going to make some changes in the office and I want your input. I don't want to do it here because it sometimes seems like the walls in this place have ears." 

At a quarter after five Phil joined me at the bar. He got a drink and I started to tell him the plans I had for reorganizing the office. It was all bullshit, but he didn't know that. I kept his attention while Marcus took the stool next to him and when the needle slid into Phil he had just enough time to look surprised before the injection made him drowsy. Marcus and I helped him go outside -- just two friends helping a buddy who had overindulged -- and when we got Phil outside I helped Marcus get him into the white van. I thanked Marcus for all of his help and he got in the van and drove away. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Marcus and I had gone to high school together and shortly after graduation he was busted for selling pot and did two years in prison. He always maintained that he was set up and framed and whether or not it was true I didn't know. What I did know was that once he got out Marcus rarely did anything legal. He was into drugs, prostitution, gambling, loan sharking and some other things I was just as happy not knowing about. 

He learned a lot in prison and he made dozens of contacts and he put them all to good use in his various activities. There wasn't anything that he couldn't get for you and nothing he wouldn't do for you if the price was right. His help didn't cost me anything because when he got out of prison I loaned him money and helped him get back on his feet and he never forgot it. 

In fact, he not only didn't cost me anything I made money off of him. He gave me a grand for the use of Becca the first time she took the white van ride and he gave me another grand when I gave her to him Friday. He got his money back and then some selling her. He got fifty bucks a pop from the thirty-one who used her the first time. I don't know what he made over the last weekend, but whatever it was was pure gravy. He got his grand back when he sold her to a motorcycle club who were going on a run to Mexico. They were going to use her until they were ready to come home and then try to get their money back by selling her to a whore house in Mexico. 

I didn't expect to ever see Becca again. 

In addition to handling female prostitutes Marcus also had a couple of gay males on his payroll. A group of gays who were heavily into BDSM asked him for someone they could play with and Marcus, knowing how whoever he gave them was going to be used, did not want any of his regular stable damaged so he was more than happy to help me with my Phil problem. I didn't know when or even if I would see Phil again, but if I did I'd bet you could slide a telephone pole up his ass without the need for grease and he would probably have a very sore jaw. Best of all he would know why because part of the deal was that somewhere along the line someone was going to say: 

"Damned glad you fucked that Becca bitch. We wouldn't have your tight ass to play with if it wasn't for that." 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

Tuesday two hundred eighty-three packages went out to the friends, relatives and neighbors of Phil, Mel and Charlie. I don't know what the effect was on Mel since his wife was part of the group, but hopefully his relatives and neighbors didn't know about Mel and Judy's 'hobby' and would let them know in no uncertain terms what they thought about it. And then there was this. There might not be a problem where Judy was concerned, but Mel knew he had a problem -- me! He must have gotten his package Tuesday when he got home from work because Wednesday he called in sick and Thursday morning I got a call from Human Resources that Mel had called and given his resignation effective immediately. 

Charlie found out rather quickly what his wife thought about it. She got her package on Wednesday, called work and told him not to bother coming home because the locks had already been changed on the house. The next day he was whining that she had cleaned him out. Apparently she hit the banks and took it all before calling him and telling him to go to hell. Of course Charlie wasn't telling the people at work why she had kicked him out and I hadn't mailed a package to anyone in the office. 

Except me. 

Thursday after the mail had been delivered I walked out of my office and over to Charlie and without a word I hit him as hard as I could. His chair rolled backward and as he tried to stand I hit him again. He went down on the floor and I started kicking him in the ribs and in the crotch. A couple of guys pulled me off of him and one of them said: 

"What the fuck Rob; have you gone nuts?" 

I handed Dave the envelope that I had tucked in my belt and said: 

"He's lucky I don't have a gun in the office or the cocksucker would be dead right now." 

Dave looked at a couple of the photos and called Charlie a worthless cocksucker and spit on him. I bent down and said: 

"This whole mess is personal and not job related so I can't fire you, but you need to find another job and quickly because from this day forward this is what I'm going to do to you every fucking day that you walk into this office." 

I stood up, kicked him hard in the balls and walked back into my office. Charlie didn't come to work Friday and Monday morning Human Resources called me and told me that I had lost another member of my team. 

"What the hell are you doing over there Rob? That's two in a week." 

"Just called three of them into the office and told them that their performance was sub-standard and they needed to get their heads out of their asses or I was going to get rid of them. I guess they decided that they couldn't get with the program and decided to quit rather than have a termination on their record." 

"You said three. Who is the other one?" 

"Phil Trainor." 

"Will we be hearing from him also?" 

"Most definitely. He has been a no call no show for three days now and the CP&P says that is grounds for termination. I'm doing the paperwork right now and you should have it late this afternoon." 

I never did get any physical satisfaction from Mel, but I did get a form of payback. Based on the material I had sent them his neighbors decided that he was a pervert and they didn't want him in the neighborhood where he could get to their children. He was so informed and he told them to fuck off. Acts of vandalism started occurring and after about thirty thousand dollars worth of damage to his house and cars he got the message and put his house up for sale and moved. Give the economy and the current housing market he had to have lost money on the deal. 

I stopped in at the police station and turned in a missing persons report on Becca. I told the officer that took the report that I didn't want her back. I just thought it should be on the record that she was missing. I showed him the photos I had from the gangbang and told him I had found them on the kitchen table when I'd come home from work and she was gone. 

"I guess when she got the photos in the mail she thought I would for sure find out so she packed her bags and ran." 

"Why? Would you have hurt her?" 

"I guess we will never know for sure, but probably not. I would probably have wanted to know she didn't tell me so that I could join in. See the tits on that redhead? Boy would I have liked to get my mouth on them." 

++++++++++++++++++++= 

It has been two years now and no one has seen or heard from Phil. Marcus might know what happened to him, but I don't want to know bad enough to ask. 

I do have a rough idea of what happened to Becca and where she is. Well maybe not where she is, but I do have an inkling as to what she is doing. Marcus told me that the bikers had indeed sold her to a Mexican whore house and not just any old whore house. It seems that one was looking for a "gringa" to take part in some of their specialty acts. Those of you who have been to Tijuana have probably heard of those 'specialty' acts. Oh well, Becca did say that she liked the full feeling that big cocks gave her. Report_Story
