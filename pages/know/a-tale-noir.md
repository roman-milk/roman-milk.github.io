This is something different. I thought I would try something new for a change. 

I hope you dear readers enjoy it. 

It's a work of fiction and all characters are fictitious. 

And of course, we're all adults here. 

The cast of this tale: 

Christine Logan-A spunky brunette xenobiologist, fresh out of the Academy and on her very first mission. 

Rachel Byron-A cute blonde geologist, very buxom and tall, genius level intelligence. 

Bree Drover-A dainty redheaded pilot, very fiery and very petite. 

The cast of villians will be discovered as our lovely heroines embark on their mission. 

Now enjoy, and let me know if it's a worthwhile read. Thank you. 

***** 

CHAPTER ONE 

The vessel burst out of hyperspace with a blinding flash of light. Trailing steam, smoke, and showered in lightning. If space wasn't a vacuum, airless, and soundless, the boom would've been deafening. The only sound onboard was the groan of the hyperdrive core spooling down. Slowly returning to its idle state as the realspace engines came online. 

The vessel, an explorer class starship, christened the S.S. Horizon. Small and sleek with a crew of only 400. Scientists and researchers mostly. Searching the galaxy for signs of alien life. Civilizations. Hoping to find habitable worlds for Mankind's expansion. Searching for alternative energy sources and alternative medicines among the vast galaxy's planets. 

The vessel entered realspace in orbit around a large green world. The fourth planet from a giant red star. Simply named 34m34g. For the 34th mission of the 34th exploratory group. Imagination was scarce among the stars as logic and science ruled the day. 

Christine Logan stepped from the shower and started to dry her body with a thin towel. Smiling to herself. Only 22 and already graduated from the Academy. With honors. Top of her class. She didn't apply for this mission. She was handpicked. Looking at her naked body in the mirror she smiled again. Slim, with just enough curves, her long brunette hair straight and full. She is ready to take on the universe. At least the plant side of it. 

As Christine was getting dressed, Rachel Byron was packing her gear. Scanners, carbon readers, and the various tools and picks of her trade. All wrapped up and packed in her favorite carbon fiber case. Putting her long blonde hair up in a ponytail she ran through her checklist again. It wouldn't do to forget something. Even though she never did. It took a lot to dispel the theoretical logic that even in the 22nd century blondes were all still ditzy bimbos. Whatever. Just because she had the body of a bimbo didn't mean she had the brains of one. 

In the ship's hangar, Bree Drover was performing the final checks on her shuttle's systems. Engines online. Comms up and clear. All visual, thermal, and barometric gauges clear and online. Her jumpsuit tight on her body as she ran the checks again. All of them. Her red hair in ringlets, her green eyes sharp. The eyes that didn't miss a thing. Checking the time, she was able to perform one last sweep of the outer hull, looking for cracks, dents, and anything that would cause problems on atmospheric entry. Smiling, she even liked the color. 

"Third exploratory group, away team, landing party and pilot report to Captain Divan for briefing and mission parameters!" sounded the ship's intercom. Blaring from every onboard speaker. As the Horizon stabilized in low planetary orbit. Her attitudinal thrusters and retro boosters firing in short, controlled bursts. Keeping her stable and in a slow orbit. Scanners came on and swept the planet. 

Feeling giddy with excitement over her first mission, Christine quickly dressed. Slipping on a skimpy and sheer pair of black panties, she decided against a bra. Zipping into a tight jumpsuit and looking for her boots she paused to look out of the porthole. Contemplating the green planet below. Biting her lip and smiling. 

In her cabin, Rachel took another quick look at her gear. Just for her own peace of mind she checked it again. Obsessive to the point of being a bit, over obsessive. Already dressed she took one last look around her cabin and headed for the briefing room. Shaking her head slowly as Christine ran past. "Hurry hurry slowpoke, you'll get left onboard!" Christine yelled giggling from down the hall. Rachel shook her head again and kept her pace, walking to the briefing and thinking about every piece of gear in her kit. 

Coming up from the hangars, Bree exited the elevator just in time to feel the breeze of Christine running by. "Hurry hurry or I'll fly the shuttle and leave you here with blondie," Christine yelled. Her giggles echoing down the hall. The briefing room at the end of the corridor. The doors slid open, then shut. Christine disappearing inside. 

Rachel walked up alongside Bree, smiling. "She's a feisty one isn't she?" said Rachel. "Feisty and a handful of trouble, you ask me," Bree replied. "She keeps calling me ginger and I'll leave her planetside," grinned Bree. 

"Well she's just a girl really, could've done with a few more years at the Academy I think," Rachel said. As the girls reached the doors to the briefing room , pausing, Bree said, "Wait Rach. Before we go in there, do we need to talk about what happened before we left the last supply station?" 

Rachel smiled and held Bree's dainty white hand. "Only if it's to talk about when we can do it again," she said. Leaning down, holding Bree's chin up and kissing her lips softly. Kissing back, Bree grinned and said, "Maybe we can ditch the biologist and find some alone time down there, on the planet?" On tiptoes and leaning in to kiss Rachel again. Her petite body in her tight jumpsuit just barely coming up to Rachel's shoulder. 

"Aye-firmative," whispered Rachel, kissing Bree. Holding her hand and gently biting Bree's lower lip. Then, smiling at each other, they composed themselves and entered the stark white briefing room. 

CHAPTER TWO 

As Rachel and Bree entered the briefing room Captain Diras nodded at them. Christine was already sitting at the long white table poring over some charts and graphs. The Captain sitting at the head of the table, his uniform starched white and very crisp. 

"Have a seat ladies," he said. Beckoning them in and towards the chairs. The two girls joined Christine and sat, as the Captain's assistant handed them packets of information. 

"As you know, we've entered this system to drop your team off for a geological and biological survey," he told Rachel. As the senior member of the team it fell to her to lead the mission. "In your packets you'll find the preliminary results of our long range scans." 

Pressing a few buttons on a small pad built into the table a three dimensional hologram flickered into life in the center of the table. The image of the planet they were orbiting, slowly turning. Green and blue. 

"There's an abundance of flora, and the oceans are teeming with fish and aquatic mammals, but we haven't found traces of habitation. As far as we know it would be perfect for colonization," he explained. 

"However," he said. Rachel sighed, thinking how there's always a however. "If you'll look here," the Captain said, pausing the hologram. "There seems to be a clearing at the base of this large hill." He pointed to a large green protrusion, the ground seeming bare at the foot of it. 

"It appears to be at the entrance to a cave system, but our scans fail to penetrate the rock. We believe it contains large deposits of iridium." Christine giggled slightly as he said the word penetrate, earning a glance from Rachel. 

"Your mission Rachel," the Captain continued, undaunted, "is to enter the caves and see if the iridium is mineable for profit." He looked at her with a smile. "Christine will accompany you to survey the level of underground algae and bacteria, to see if subterranean hydroponics are a viable option." 

Looking at the hologram, Bree asked, "Will there be enough ground to land the shuttle Captain?" The hologram showing large details but not vivid or precise ones. 

"We believe so Bree," Captain Diras replied, running his fingers through his cropped grey hair. "However, if there's any doubt, Christine and Rachel will drop on cables and clear the necessary vegetation with plasma burners." 

Christine and Rachel both grimaced at that. Not really liking the idea of hard physical work in a steamy jungle environment. "Also," the Captain continued, "the atmosphere and gravity are comparable to Earth, so environment suits and grav packs won't be necessary." 

"Thank goodness for small favours," thought Rachel as she looked over her mission parameters and information package. Her mind picturing every piece of gear she packed, cataloging it and wondering if she should check it yet again. 

"And finally," the Captain began, looking at the three girls. "As you know, we're en route to the Taurine System. With vital meds to counter an outbreak of viral encephalitis. As such, that mission takes priority, so," he said, drawing it out. "We will be leaving your team planetside, and will return in three weeks." 

Rachel shook her head slowly, her eyes on him glaring. Bree rolled her eyes and made a exaggerated sigh. Christine beamed, excited at her first mission, planetside, and the prospect of three weeks of uninterrupted studies. 

"Are there any questions?" the Captain asked. When none were forthcoming he stood, smiling. "I'm sure you will all fulfill your duties to the best of your considerable abilities. I'll leave you to make your final preparations. Mission begins in one hour. Dismissed." 

Rachel collected her file and left, thinking she better check that gear at least twice more. Maybe make another checklist, her obsessive mind in gear. Christine scurried out quickly, then scurried back for her forgotten information packet, then scurried out again. Her tight little body jiggling. As Bree started to leave Captain Diras stopped her. 

"Bree, wait up a minute," he said, taking her aside. "Yes Captain?" she asked, looking up at him, his tall frame dwarfing her diminutive figure. His eyes just glancing at the cleavage visible, with her jumpsuit slightly unzipped. Her breasts freckled and pale. 

"Bree, as the only member of this team with any military training, I need you to be sure to visit the armoury before takeoff. Requisition a few carbines and sidearms," he told her in a serious voice. "I didn't want to alarm the other girls, but there's been possible sightings of pirate marauders in the next system over." 

Bree's eyes went a bit wide at that. "Pirates Captain?" she asked. Just a hint of trepidation. In a reassuring voice, Captain Diras rested a hand on her shoulder, saying, "It's probably just rumour Bree, you know how gossip gets around a ship. But it never hurts to be cautious." 

"Yes Captain," she said. Her green eyes looking up at him respectfully. "It never hurts, and I'll be sure we are well armed Sir," she said with a smile. "Good Bree, have a safe flight and I'll see you in three weeks," he told her. Watching her firm behind in her jumpsuit as Bree left the room. 

The three girls were off to make final preparations for the three week mission that would see them on a strange world, alone, and exploring for the benefit of all Mankind. 

CHAPTER THREE 

Christine Logan stowed her bag in the shuttle's hold. Smiling at the other members of the team. Rachel Byron and Bree Drover. Bree's copilot was an energetic cyborg. Very realistic and very human looking. His name was technically SAM1SP175. But everybody just called him Sam. 

Rachel checked her bag. For the third time since leaving her cabin for the hangar. Triple checking every bit of gear. Making sure, then making sure again, that it was all there. 

Bree was in the cockpit with Sam, her co-pilot, running a few last checks. Her sidearm holstered and the other weapons stowed in the hold. The Captain had come to wish them a safe trip and good fortune but hadn't stayed. 

"Engines running sound," said Bree. "Confirmed," replied Sam. 

"Comms up," Bree said into her headset. Rachel and Christine returned with, "Loud and clear." 

"All systems and all readouts, gauges, and monitors reading green," said Bree, as she looked over the dazzling cluster. "Passengers secure and ready?" she asked. 

Rachel and Christine were buckled firmly in harnesses and strapped to their chairs. "Affirmative," both replied. 

"Closing rear hatch," said Bree, the ramp folding up and locking shut. Rachel checking her suit zipper and harness again, her obsessive nature forcing her to always be checking everything. Christine giggled and asked her, "You sure you got everything," just to tease her. Rachel shot her a glare then started thinking if she really did have everything. 

Warning klaxons and flashing strobes began, as Bree cycled up the shuttle's engines and opened up the thrusters. The hangar doors closing slowly and with a heavy thump. The outer doors slowly opening to the vacuum of outer space. The remaining oxygen in the hangar vented with a loud whoosh. 

"Prepare for gravity dump," said Bree, as she hovered the shuttle slowly to the door. "I hate this part," muttered Christine as Rachel closed her eyes. 

The shuttle slowly hovered on thrusters to the open bay exit. Bree expertly handling the ship out into space. Very slowly leaving, Christine looked back and gave a girly wave to the Horizon. Rachel keeping her eyes closed and mentally taking inventory of her gear. 

"Gravity dump in 3-2-1," Bree counted down, in unison with Sam. As she threw the lever that released the shuttle from the artificial gravity field maintained by the Horizon the shuttle lurched and dropped towards the planet like a meteor falling from space. Onboard, as the shuttle dropped, three perky sets of breasts lifted high and all at once. Rachel's being the biggest, Bree's the perkiest, and Christine's the most firm. 

The shuttle dropped to the surface of the planet as the mothership Horizon cruised away preparing to leave the system in hyperspace. Rachel keeping her eyes closed to avoid nausea, Christine giggling like a girl on a roller coaster, and Bree with Sam piloting the shuttle as a team. 

Unseen by all, on the far side of the planet's single moon, watchers observed the shuttle's descent. Observed with malicious intent. Awaiting the departure of the large vessel into hyperspace before leaving their hidden shadow. Scanners only revealing life signs and one cyborg. The pirate marauder's sleek vessel hidden from sensor sweeps and scans. Using sophisticated cloaking and stealth technology. 

Captain Bronson, leader of the pirate clan, watched the shuttle descend and grinned. 

CHAPTER FOUR 

The shuttle entering the planet's atmosphere began to heat up. The outer skin warming to a cozy red glow. The interior comfortable but vibrating. The tremors building in intensity and the girls all shaking in their chairs. The cyborg Sam, maintaining a firm grip on the controls as Bree kept a watchful eye on hull integrity monitors. 

Then suddenly, red skies. Clouds. The small ship breaking through the stratosphere and entering the open skies of the as yet undiscovered world. The planet's sun filtered through the atmosphere, giving the sky its reddish tint. 

"All systems reading green," Bree chimed over the comm. "The air is breathable, and there's no sign of radiation. The temperature is a balmy ninety degrees up here, and will be warmer on the surface. Hope you ladies brought your bikinis," she finished with a giggle. Christine giggled as well, wondering how Bree knew about the little green bikini in her bag. 

As the shuttle dropped down into the planet's skies, the pirate vessel moved from its hiding place. The Horizon gone with a burst of light into hyperspace. On the pirate's marauder class vessel, the small crew begins preparing. Arming themselves and fitting body gloves. The captain keeping everyone in line with promises of equal shares of whatever they take. 

Bree circled the landing site twice, making sure there was room enough to bring down the shuttle. "Prepare for landing," she announced, as she slowed to hover over the clearing. 

Christine stared out the porthole next to her in wonder at the amount of life visible. Plants and trees and shrubs and all manner of vines. Wondering if three weeks would be enough to even begin cataloging it all. 

Slowly the shuttle dropped. "Landing in 3-2-1," Bree said, echoed by her cyborg copilot. The shuttle eased gently to the ground, a testament to her skill as a pilot. "And we're down," she said, removing the harness keeping her in her seat. "Sam, shut down the engines and do post flight checks of all systems," she told the cyborg. "Affirmative," he replied, in an almost human voice. 

As all three girls stood, Rachel activated the rear loading ramp. As it slowly lowered the jungle air wafted in, bringing the scent of humid vegetation. Christine was positively thrilled, her first mission bringing her to a world of plant life she had never before seen. 

Exiting the shuttle, Bree did a check of the perimeter as Rachel began unloading gear. "We will make camp here, and at first light we will begin the survey of the cave network," she said, looking at the dark chasm in front of the shuttle. 

Aside from the stealthy pirate vessel, and unbeknownst to the three girls, another set of eyes watched them with vile interest. 

CHAPTER FIVE 

Hidden deep within the cave arcology, in a secret laboratory, an evil genius resided. Dr. Van Lester. Exiled from the world of men for conducting sadistic experiments, he built a laboratory on this world. Far from prying eyes, him and his assistant, a cruel dwarf named only Hugo, resided. His experiments continue but to his chagrin, he only has plant life and the occasional victim to tinker with. Until now. His network of hidden cameras reveal three young subjects and his twisted mind already begins to plot. 

As the girls set up camp, giggling and talking, the sun begins to set. The heat begins to let up a bit and a fire is built. Meal packets are brought out and the girls begin to eat, grimacing at the taste of packaged meals. The cyborg Sam shuts down to run self checks and diagnostics. 

"I can't wait to explore the caves," Christine said, excitedly. "I'll bet I discover a new plant life or a new form of medicinal algae," she giggles. Rachel shakes her head with a grin, saying, "I'll bet you fall in a hole and need saving," much to Bree's delight. 

"Have you ever been on an away mission this long?" Christine asks the other two girls. Rachel and Bree lock eyes and smile at each other. "Not so long but, we've had some interesting encounters," says Bree, making Rachel giggle. 

Rolling her eyes, Christine just shakes her head. Hoping she doesn't catch them naked or anything like that. Since working so hard at the Academy, Christine never really had time for a boyfriend. Or girlfriend. It wasn't something she really missed though. Schoolwork was so much more important. 

With a smile, Rachel pulled a flask from her jumpsuit. "Anyone care for a sip of rum?" she asked, uncapping the small bottle. Bree and Christine giggled and both nodded yes with glee. 

As the girls sipped rum, giggling and talking, telling stories, the vile Dr. Van Lester watched. His secret cameras capturing every angle. His monitors and scanners also alerting him to the presence of the pirate marauder in low orbit. His technology easily the match for pirate stealth. 

"Prepare the lab Hugo, we shall soon have visitors," he told his assistant dwarf. "Yes Doctor," Hugo replied, scurrying off to make preparations for receiving company. The evil Doctor grinning, rubbing his hands together, and chuckling insanely as he watched the three beautiful girls chatting around the fire. The picture of innocence.

CHAPTER SIX 

The marauder belched forth a shuttle. A landing craft for a small team of ruffians. As it sped away, the main craft tracked its offspring's descent. Twin laser cannons mounted on the marauder's hull turned in all directions, searching for any threat. As the shuttle achieved orbit, the marauder class vessel turned and set a course for orbit around a small moon not far away. Hiding. Watching. Waiting. 

The pirate's shuttle glided silently over the lush green jungle. Slowly. The men inside eager and ready to plunder. Since the system they called home became heavily monitored, the chances of getting caught and hung increased tenfold. The raids they mounted became far and few and much less lucrative. Causing much strife and bitterness in an otherwise unpleasant bunch. Never very amicable to begin with, now that things were on a downturn all the men were even more vicious and hateful. Always looking to inflict suffering on the citizens they felt had wronged them. 

As Rachel, Christine, and Bree slept under the stars, less then a kilometer away the pirates made planetfall. The pirate shuttle silently spraying chemical defoliant and clearing an area large enough to touch down. 

Dr. Van Lester and Hugo watched as the pirates struck camp. Unloading equipment and generally preparing for a dawn raid. Hoping to catch whoever their unknowing victims happened to be in deep slumber. However... 

An hour before dawn, the cyborg Sam awoke from his regeneration cycles. Scanning the jungle, his sensors didn't have the range to find the nearby pirate vessel. As programmed, he went from scientist to pilot to scientist, gently waking each in turn. 

As Rachel was awakened, wearing a black sleep bodyglove, she told Sam, "Wake the others and then make coffee. We need to be on mission in 30 minutes." He replied, "Affirmative," as he moved to Bree's sleeping bag. 

Bree awoke with a start before the cyborg could even stir her. Looking around with a sudden sense of awareness, her hand on the pistol at her belt. Her curly red hair up in a tight ponytail. Wearing a green jumpsuit and holster. With a sigh, she looked up at Sam then arose. 

As the cyborg went to Christine and gently stirred her, he had the hardest time of it. Rolling over, Christine grumbled and said, "Ugh mom, I don't want to go to school today." Stirring her a bit more insistently, Sam finally woke her. Sitting up and rubbing her sleepy eyes, looking around at the pre-dawn jungle, she grumbled again. Rachel and Bree both took notice of the tiny green string bikini Christine slept in, barely covering her body. 

"Let's get going ladies," Rachel said. "Mission starts in twenty minutes. I'm first in the hydrowash on the shuttle." Christine and Bree both groaned and threw their pillows at her. The sun's faint glow barely starting to show. 

As Rachel headed up the ramp into the shuttle for a quick shower, Bree watched Christine rolling up her sleeping bag. The skimpy bikini did nothing to hide the girl's jiggling body as the cute brunette packed her sleep gear and brushed her hair. Bree watching her with a bit of...desire. 

A kilometer away the group of pirates geared up and loaded weapons. Captain Bronson instructing his five men to keep quiet, and be prepared for any resistance to be dealt with sternly and viciously. 

As the sun began to glow on the horizon, and a new day began to dawn. 

CHAPTER SEVEN 

The sun slowly started to light up the sky as Bree stepped down the shuttle's ramp. Fresh from the hydrowash and wearing her flight suit, a pistol holstered at her side, she approached Christine and Rachel. "Take these with you ladies," she said, as she handed out two holsters with loaded handguns. "Just in case," she added. Rachel took one and strapped it around her narrow waist. Christine just looked at it. 

"I'm looking for plants, why do I need that?" Christine asked. "I really wasn't making a request. Take it and wear it," Bree replied. Rolling her eyes, Christine took the proffered weapon and tossed it in with her gear. "Fine like, whatever," she said petulantly. 

"I want you both to check in every ten minutes," Bree instructed. "At least until the rock prevents comms from working. After that, I want you back here within thirty minutes," she continued. Standing with her hands on her hips, the dainty redhead looked stern. Looking up at Rachel and Christine with her green eyes. "Do I make myself clear?" she asked. 

Christine and Rachel both said, "Aye-firmative," at the same time. Christine giggled and punched Rachel's arm saying, "Jinx!" Showing amazing self-control Rachel just smiled, the image of Christine over her lap getting spanked hard making her grin even wider. 

"Set the time girls," Rachel said. "Mission begins right now." All three girls pressing a timer on their respective watches. A timer synced on the shuttle began to count the minutes on mission for the research logs. The cyborg also begin his internal timer, marking the mission start time. 

Bree watched as Rachel and Christine strapped on gearbags and headed for the cave entrance. Watched as the darkness swallowed them up before they lit electrotorches, then watched as the light faded. Then she began running diagnostics on the shuttle with Sam as they checked for damage from atmospheric entry. 

At the same time, the group of pirates came within twenty metres of the shuttle. They were very quietly sneaking through the jungle. Then the pirate captain Bronson brought the group to a halt. "Right you lot, draw weapons and prepare for action," he told the rough group. The silent sounds of blades and pistols being drawn was swallowed by the verdant green jungle. Once prepared, he gave the order, "Move in and show no mercy!" 

The pirates charge ate up the twenty metres in less than five minutes, through the thick jungle vines. 

Rachel and Christine were slowly making their way down the sloping cave. The darkness thick and the walls dripping moisture from condensation. Both girls wearing black bodygloves and heavy gear strapped on their backs. Light from electrotorches showing the dark rock walls, lined with mineral deposits. The floor slick with algae slime. That's when they came to a fork in the passage. Two chambers leading in different directions. 

"My scanner shows life signs down this way," Christine told Rachel. "Abundant life signs," she added. "Mine shows heavy concentrations of ore this way," replied Rachel, pointing down the other passage. The two girls looking at each other for a minute. "We split up here," said Rachel. "Rendezvous on this point in thirty minutes for a quick report, then we head back out to the shuttle and log our findings," she finished. Nodding yes, Christine bit her lip with nervous excitement at her first chance of finding new strains of plant life and bacteria. With a quick hug the girls parted ways, each heading down a different cave tunnel, to a different fate. 

CHAPTER EIGHT-RACHEL 

As Rachel headed down the cave tunnel she selected, she swept her scanner side to side. Turning on her personal recorder she began to note temperature, time, and date. The tunnel continued to slope downwards, her steps taken with care as the floor was rocky, damp, and slick. 

"The rock seems embedded with iridium in incredible quantities," she spoke into the recorder. "Initial scans read high levels of purity and very minor amounts of bacterial growth here." As she spoke, her voice echoed down the tunnel. Stopping at a rich vein, she took a small pick and container out. Chipping a few bits of the iridium to take back for analysis. 

Stopping and turning her head to the side, she listened closely. Her ears picking up just a faint hint of a strange humming. Putting away her collected sample, she slowly moved farther down the cave tunnel. Keeping her ears alert, she realized it really was a humming sound coming from somewhere up ahead. 

"Bree, Christine, do you copy my transmission?" she said into her comm unit. Receiving only static she shook it, dropping her electrotorch in the attempt. The shattering bulb was matched by her muttered curse, but she noticed without the light the tunnel remained illuminated. A soft glow coming from a chamber just ahead and around a turn in the tunnel. 

Looking ahead, then back the way she came, she made a decision. After all, it was her duty to explore and report findings. And besides, they were supposed to be alone on this planet. Containing just a bit of giddy excitement, she let the thought cross her mind that maybe she was about to discover some lost xeno technology or perhaps remnants of an ancient society or, something good anyways. With that thought she proceeded to walk slowly towards the soft glow. 

"Bree, Christine, anyone, do you copy," she said, trying to raise comms again. Again met with static. As she rounded the corner of the rocky cave tunnel the ground flattened out. Smoothed out. Almost unnaturally smooth. She took note of this and her hand felt the grip of the pistol on her hip. 

"Relax Rachel," she told herself. "This is an uninhabited rock. There's no way anyone else is here." Her own voice reassuring herself, she took the final few steps and entered the softly lit chamber. 

Before her eyes, floating midway off the floor she beheld a golden orb. Suspended and spinning on a slow axis. The source of the glow coming from within. Roughly two meters in diameter, and traced through with what looked like crystal. Her mouth agape in wonder she stared at it. Transfixed. 

"I don't believe it," she said to herself. "Amazing." Her lovely blue eyes wide in awe, she took out her scanner and swept the orb. The return showed no sign of anything. The orb didn't even register on the device. Looking at her scanner, a look of confusion crossed her face. As she raised her gaze to once more behold the slowly spinning, shimmering orb, a bolt of blue lightning struck. Emanating from the sphere it hit Rachel squarely in the center of her forehead, yet left no mark or burn. The crackling energy connected her forehead to the orb for less than a second and when it stopped, Rachel's whole world went black. She never even felt herself hit the ground. 

CHAPTER NINE-BREE 

At the landing site, Bree Drover was checking the underside of the shuttle. Sometimes on atmospheric entry the heat caused warpage or streaking of the protective layer. Such things needed to be checked every time. 

As she looked over the shuttle the cyborg Sam was running a sweep of the area and monitoring temperature, humidity, and atmospheric integrity. Not that he needed oxygen, but his crewmates did. Bree looked over at him from under the shuttle, and smiled. She didn't need a gauge to measure heat and humidity. With the sun coming up it was already getting hot. 

Bree started to feel the heat and unzipped the top half of her flight suit. Tying the arms around her waist she started working again, just in her tank top and undersuit body glove. It was still hot. 

Just then the cyborg began sending a warning. To all the comms and the shuttle, startling Bree. "Warning! Warning! Intruders! Intru..." his alert sounded, then was cut off suddenly. Bree had just enough time to get out from under the shuttle and stand, when Sam's head rolled to a stop at her feet. Sparking and crackling, his augmetic eyes already black and dead. 

Looking to where he stood she saw his body slowly fold and fall, headless. Standing next to his ruined android form was the biggest man she had ever seen. Dressed all in black and holding a long electrified blade, sneering at her. Suddenly he was joined by several other violent looking men, all wearing black, all brandishing weapons. 

Quickly drawing her sidearm she lifted it, taking a quick bead on the giant that had killed the cyborg. She never got a single shot off. Coming from the side, one of the pirates used a long whip, lashing it around her wrist and yanking. With a cry of pain her wrist and arm jerked and her pistol went flying. To the pirate's amusement. Their laughter rough and deep. 

"Well well well, what is all this now?" chuckled a pirate carrying a long rifle and lazily pointing it at Bree. Her wrist struggling to free itself from the whip. Looking around, she counted five of the brutes, all armed to the teeth. Screaming out she yanked her arm free of the whip, the pirate holding it smiling as he coiled it for another strike. As Bree tried to quickly get to the shuttle ramp and the false safety of her ship, the whip struck once again. This time wrapping around her neck and bringing her to her knees. 

As she choked and fell, the rest of the violent men were upon her. Grabbing her. Laughing with evil glee as they began ripping off her flightsuit. Her struggles futile but quite enthusiastic. Her fists and legs kicking in every direction, to no avail. One by one each item of her clothing was ripped, torn, yanked off her petite pale body. 

"Stop! Wait, stop!" she screamed. The only reply was more laughter. Finally on the jungle floor, divested of everything but her skimpy green g-string panties the largest of her attackers placed his massive booted foot on her chest, easily pinning her down. The one holding the whip pulled it tighter around her neck, choking her. Bree's hands vainly trying to loosen its suffocating grip. 

Just then, Captain Bronson walked through the jungle cover, into the clearing. "Alright you lot, secure this shuttle and perimeter," he commanded. Looking down at Bree, he grinned as she looked up at who was clearly the leader. Her gasping breaths causing her perky breasts to rise and fall. 

"Men, I will be onboard our shuttle. This was an easy take, so once secure prepare this shuttle for voyage to our main craft," he instructed. "You have one hour." 

"You can't take my ship!" Bree protested, despite her near nakedness. "You can't maroon me here!" she went on, gasping under the boot keeping her pinned. 

Looking at her, Captain Bronson grinned. "You are correct girly," he told Bree. "Once these men have prepped your ship and collected everything in the area, they will have their fun with you. Then you're coming with us," he explained. "This turned out to be quite a profitable venture," he said, smiling as he turned to leave. "You may take your time, you now have two hours," he told the men as he walked away. 

As her panties were yanked off, Bree began to scream. 

CHAPTER TEN-CHRISTINE 

Christine watched as Rachel walked away, then smiled to herself. Her first real mission and she was already trusted to go solo. With a bounce in her step she started down her fork of the cave tunnel. Using her electrotorch and scanner, she searched for plant or bacterial life. For several hundred feet nothing showed, however the air became more and more humid. 

"The rising humidity is a good sign of plant or vegetation present," she said into her recorder. Then, giggling as she remembered to turn on her recorder. "Oops," she giggled as she flipped the power on. 

"It's getting more humid the deeper I go, a good sign," she repeated. As the tunnel continued Christine noticed her scanner beginning to pick up signs of living matter. "The humidity is a sign of vegetation, and now the scanner is showing some returns," she said as she continued on. 

As she crossed past a slight bend Christine stopped, her mouth agape in wonder. Stretching out before her, the walls were covered in algae. Some luminescence emanating from the vegetation lighting the tunnel softly. Naturally. Taking a few steps she stopped and opened her pack, to take out a sample collection kit. Several jars and tools unwrapped and strapped to each leg, she began by collecting a sample of the bioluminescent algae. 

Forgetting to record her find, nearly speechless, she continued down the cave tunnel in awe. Then, as she rounded another turn, the tunnel lit by the omnipresent algae, she stopped. Looking at the floor of the tunnel, she observed several pods. Small and seedlike, as she stepped to the nearest bunch of them they slowly opened. Causing her to gasp. 

"It seems I've discovered some form of seed deposits, from an as yet unknown organism. I will collect a sample then move on deeper," she said, finally remembering to record her research. Taking several pictures before kneeling, she put on her gloves and goggles. "Safety first," she giggled. 

"The pods seem to react to my presence, opening up into what looks like short vines or cilia. They appear to move as if in a marine setting. I will collect a sample now," she recorded. 

Taking out a small knife, Christine attempted to cut a pod from the floor of the cave. The reaction was instantaneous. She giggled as the vines wrapped around her fingers, pulling gently. Switching the knife to her other hand she cut them away, and as she did so, a thick white substance spurted all over her hands and the floor. As she began collecting samples, she paused. 

"I am collecting samples of the pod, the cilia, and the fluid within for later analysis," she said. Pausing again, Christine listened closely. Turning off her recorder and removing her goggles. 

"Hello? Rachel is that you?" she called out. As she listened closely, she heard it again. A slithering organic sound, coming from the chamber ahead. Looking towards it, she stood up and slowly walked past the pods on the floor. All of them opening as she passed, and seeming to reach for her. 

"Hello, is someone there?" she called out again, walking slowly. Turning to look back at the cavern, and the tunnel behind her, Christine stepped on slowly, entering the final chamber of the cave. 

"Oh my god," she gasped as she walked into the final cavern. The glow from the algae illuminated the entire cave chamber, and as she dropped her electrotorch and stood wide eyed, she saw what was causing the slithering sounds. 

Against the opposite cave wall, twenty feet away, was a huge opened pod, obviously the same species as the smaller pods but, different. The vines and cilia longer, of various thickness, and covering the walls and the floor of the chamber. Pulsing with life and moving like serpents. With the sudden realization of what they were, Christine said one word, almost a whisper. 

"Tentacles..." 

CHAPTER 10-RACHEL 

Rachel Byron slowly regained consciousness, her head full of cobwebs. Shaking her skull a bit to clear it, she groaned. Her entire body stiff and sore. How long had she been out? Where was she? What was the orb? The last thing she remembered was looking at a shimmering sphere, then she clocked out. As she tried to stretch and sit up, she found she couldn't move. She found she was immobilized. With a sudden panicked struggle, she discovered her wrists, her ankles, and her slim waist were all strapped down. Lifting her head she looked down at her body, suddenly aware she was completely naked. 

Resting her head back down, she began to panic. This was supposed to be an uninhabited planet. There shouldn't be anyone here. She shouldn't be strapped down, and she certainly shouldn't be naked. Taking a deep calming breath, Rachel forced herself to think. Slowing her breathing down, she looked at her surroundings first. She appeared to be in some sort of laboratory. Dust covered nearly every surface, except for various pieces of arcane technology. Strange devices, and unusual implements hanging from the wall. In the corner, a small tank with green water bubbled. Some weird plant or something inside of it. Along the far wall several more tanks, with different stages of the same plant growing in water. 

Then she took stock of the table she was strapped to. A large X shape that was floating on some sort of anti-grav technology. Her wrists, ankles, and waist tightly strapped to it. Looking around she saw no sign of her clothes or her gear. She couldn't see under her but the ceiling above her was loaded with lights, chains hanging, straps, and in the center some sort of multi-armed machine. Inert but with several lights indicating power and readiness.  

===

Turning her head she saw the entire other side of the lab was a bank of monitors. All of them showing her naked helpless body from several different angles. With a whimper, she thought she was completely screwed. At long last she began to wonder who her captors were. Aliens, pirates, or some unknown threat to Mankind were the first things to cross her mind. 

Then, the doors to the lab slid open on a track, and Hugo entered. His squat dwarf frame muscular and his face evilly low browed. Pushing a cart covered with a tarpulin. As she watched him Rachel trembled. 

"Release me, now," she demanded. If he heard her the dwarf showed no sign of it. Merely pushing the cart to the end of the floating table and pulling off the tarp. Under the plastic tarpulin was several bottles, a bowl, and other things Rachel couldn't quite see. The cart, being sized to the dwarfs diminutive frame, was a bit lower than her field of vision. With a gasp from Rachel and the push of a button from the dwarf, the X-shaped table she was strapped on lowered quickly. Bringing her body to a level the dwarf could work with. 

"Good evening Miss," said the dwarf. "My name is Hugo and Master has sent me to prepare you." As he said this he began to put on synthetic gloves, the material similar to a second skin in tactile feel, yet nearly impenetrable. "So don't mind me, this won't take long," he finished as he began to lather up his hands. 

As Rachel squirmed helplessly, Hugo proceeded to apply a cream to the fine hairs surrounding her blonde pussy. Humming to himself, he then took out a razor. Running it along a strop to gain a better edge as he looked at Rachel with a smile. 

"What do you think you're doing? Stop this at once and let me go," Rachel again demanded. Once more he ignored her, pressing another button on the tables small control panel. With a small hiss, two straps emerged from the lower part of the table, wrapping around Rachel's thighs tightly. Immobilized, her supple legs were completely still now. But her mouth wasn't, as she began to protest. 

"Release me! Let me go! I'm an explorer and a scientist and you can't do this to me," she told him. Her voice raising in volume with every word. Her arms struggling to get free. 

With a sigh Hugo pushed another button and two more straps emerged, wrapping around Rachels elbows. Then as a finishing touch, Hugo walked around to Rachel's mouth and silenced her shrill protests by pulling what she recognized as her own panties from his pocket. Holding her nose as she gasped, to keep her mouth open, he grinned as he stuffed them into her mouth. Muffling her pleas. 

"Thank you for your silence Miss," Hugo told Rachel as he shuffled back between her helplessly strapped legs. As her muffled protests were quieted down, he picked up the gleaming razor once again and started to run it in short strokes. Shaving her. Denuding her little blonde pussy of all its short trimmed hair. 

"I know it's primitive, but the old ways are sometimes the best ways," he told her as he shaved Rachel's pussy completely. Taking his time, and being very thorough. "And Master does insist on things being just so," he finished. As he made the last strokes. 

Rachel continued to try to squirm, the taste of her own panties filling her mouth as she watched on one of the monitors. Watched this evil little dwarf shave her pussy completely bald. Helpless to stop him. 

"You'll come to find Master is very thorough and very precise, with all he does," Hugo told her as her wiped her freshly shaven slit with a dry towel. "When I'm finished here, you will see. I will show you how thoroughly precise Master is, and how he helps people reach their full potential." 

Taking a bottle of oil off the cart, Hugo poured a generous amount over Rachel's slit, as she tried to squirm to no avail. Watching herself on the monitor, her blue eyes wide and frightened. "Fear not Miss, this is simply to prevent your body from undoing all my hard work," he said. Rubbing and massaging the oil into her soft sensitive skin. Rachel groaned as his fingers touched her most sensitive, private areas. "You shall never have hair down here again," he grinned, and giggled as he told her. 

"Now, as promised, a demonstration of Master's work," Hugo told her, as he pressed a button to drop the table Rachel was securely strapped on even lower. "He has done such wonders for me, yes yes such wonders," the cruel dwarf giggled. 

As Rachel watched in horror, seeing herself from several different angles on the monitors, Hugo dropped his trousers. What he then took out, much to her shock and disgust, was the biggest cock and set of balls Rachel had ever seen. 

CHAPTER 11-BREE 

While the giant of a pirate kept her chest pinned down with his massive boot, another of the thuggish rogues gripped her little panties and with one good yank, ripped them right off Bree Drover's dainty, petite body. Bree squealed and screamed, her cries echoing through the jungle. The two pirates with her flipped her on her tummy, and proceeded to use her torn panties to tie her wrists behind her back. All while the other men looked over her shuttle, collecting everything from the landing site and prepping for departure. 

"Oy there," said one of them as he collected the sleeping gear. "There's more than one here, maybe she got friends," he said, sneering. The giant tying Bree's wrists paused, saying, "We got no time for that lot, they just gotta stay on this rock." 

As he finished using Bree's panties to tie her wrists he smacked her ass hard, making her squeal. "You ready to play girly?" he asked. On her tummy, naked and wrists tied, Bree whimpered into the dirt as she heard a zipper being pulled down. "Please, no," she quietly pleaded. Already resigned to her fate. 

Feeling his strong hands grip her ribs, Bree squealed again. Her torso lifted, then her knees. The giant of a man easily holding her petite body up, her legs kicking. His fingers digging into her ribs, he picked Bree up and held her vertically, facing away from him and toward the false promise of safety her shuttle's ramp provided. As Bree was held in the air, the other thug came at her from the front, grinning. Tugging her nipples and twisting them, enjoying her squeals. 

"Look down girly," he told her. As Bree looked down, from between her thighs protruded a long fat cock. Easily a foot long and belonging to the giant holding her up. "There's a piece you won't soon forget," he laughed. Twisting her pink nipples again for good measure. 

Bree Drover squealed and kicked her legs up. The pirate in front of her easily grabbed her dainty ankles and pulled them up over her head. Bending her in half while suspended from behind. The giant behind her easily keeping her lifted. Effortlessly. 

Putting her ankles together the pirate in front of her upheld body produced a length of twine. Braided leather twine. Very slender and pliable. Making short work of the job he quickly crossed her ankles and tied them together. With a grin, he then tied the loose end around her neck, forcing Bree's body to stay bent in half. Her ankles tied together and then tied to her neck. Her wrists tied. Bree continued to squirm and struggle as the giant behind her wrapped a beefy arm around her waist, holding her up. His other hand reached down and guided the tip of his massive tool to her slit. Rubbing it across the thin red strip there. 

"Hold on girly, cause here it comes," he told her as he pushed the tip just in. Bree gasped. She had never felt one so big. "Oy girly, you enjoying this?" he asked her. "You're already wet," he continued as he slipped a few inches into her. Bree shook her head no, squirming, as she struggled helplessly. Her red hair a tangled mess now. Unable to deny that her pussy was indeed, wet. Despite her disgust and despite her fear, she felt the huge shaft was easily sliding up into her. Her juices flowing freely. 

"No. No. I can't be enjoying this, it can't be," she said to herself as much as anyone. But with a gasp, and a squeal, her body betrayed itself as the turgid organ slid in easily. All the way in. All twelve inches. 

As Bree looked down to watch the huge cock disappear inside her, she saw how the monster organ pushed her tummy out. Her flat, toned, and pale tummy bulged where the cock pushed in. Then again. And again as he began to thrust into her. The dainty redhead held up facing away from him, her wrists tied behind her. Her ankles crossed, tied, and bound by the twine around her neck. Completely helpless, Bree could only moan and watch as he lifted her up and down, using her body to masturbate his thick, long, hard cock. 

The other pirate, getting impatient for his turn said, "Hey, she got another hole, use that one so I can get in there." Taking his own cock out, the shape like a ripe banana, and already stiff. 

"This isn't our hole to break like that scum," the giant laughed, as he kept bouncing Bree on his cock. "You wait your turn like the others," he warned, never once stopping Bree from bouncing. Her moans soft and loud alternately. 

Grumbling, the impatient one stepped back. Watching. Bree pouting at him in pain and barely concealed pleasure as she was bounced up and down. The giant easily using her body. His full balls, the size of large plums, bouncing up against her red landing strip audibly. 

Then, at last, he held her body still. Bree's eyes went wide, green like emeralds, as she felt the flood of his semen deep inside her. So much filled her it spilled and poured out of her onto the ground, like some bladder that sprung a leak. 

By this time, all the other thugs were done prepping the shuttle and packing their stolen goods. Standing in a semi-circle watching, laughing. Cheering and whistling. 

Bree knew it was going to be a long two hours for her, as she watched every cock in the group make their arrival. 

CHAPTER 12-CHRISTINE 

Christine stood, transfixed. The chamber was cavernous, and every bit of each wall, ceiling, and floor was writhing with what she previously assumed were vines. Now she knew they were something entirely different. The scientific part of her mind began to analyze what she was seeing. Trying to catagorize the creature. A huge open pod, with a pulpy center mass and an opened top, like some flower in bloom. But instead of lovely petals, tentacles were squirming from it. 

As she looked at it, and the chamber, in some small way she started to think she might just be in danger. The bioluminescent algae keeping the cavern lit with a soft glow. Then suddenly, as she looked at the center of the huge pod, a single eye snapped open. Yellow, and looking at her with a baleful malevolence. The suddenness of it startling her. With a gasp she twitched, her body almost instinctively running for the exit. 

However, in the space of a breath, her decision was made for her. Several of the writhing appendages snapped out. Grabbing her wrists, tightly wrapping around them. Christine squealed and more tentacles flung around her ankles, wrapping tightly. As she screamed and fought to no avail she was lifted by them. Brought closer to the center of the monster. 

The tentacles around her wrists and ankles pulled apart slowly, stretching her body. Her arms and legs wide apart as she struggled and screamed. Her screaming underwritten by the slithering sounds and the sounds of something else. Some insane gurgling, and chittering. 

Held immobile, Christine Logan watched in abject horror as several threads, tentacles that looked like hair, so fine they were, wriggled from the creature. Probing the air around her squirming body as she struggled. Several brushed her skin, around her neck, over her face as she screamed. 

Unable to move, to reach her comm unit or her small utility knife, Christine screamed again. The creature gurgling, titter tittering, and the tentacles undulating. In horror, Christine felt several of the hair fine strands wiggle under her clothes. The feeling like worms against her flesh. Then she felt several more, and she began to panic. Screams echoing through the cavern. 

As she struggled, even more tiny strands wiggled under her clothes, the feeling horrific to Christine. The thicker tentacles keeping her wrists and ankles tighly held and keeping her body a few feet off the cavern floor. 

For just a heartbeat, Christine locked her eyes on the single yellow eye staring at her. Just for a single heartbeat. Then all the strands that were wiggling under her clothes pulled away at once. Suddenly. Violently. With that, every stitch of clothing Christine was wearing suddenly left her body. Her bodyglove, her flight suit, her boots, even the little bikini she was wearing under. Gone. 

If she wasn't horrified enough by her situation, being suddenly naked magnified her terror exponentially. Screaming, Christine found herself slowly being lowered, to the horizontal. Her arms and legs still spread wide and held tightly by the tentacles around her wrists and ankles. Just enough slack in them for her to struggle. 

Naked, spread, held by tentacles, Christine found herself looking up at the cavern ceiling. Writhing with more of the hideous appendages, the top of the cave seemed almost alive. The insane gurgling kept on, filling her ears with its madness. 

Panting, trying to catch her breath, Christine stopped squirming. Being held still. For just a bit, silence descended on the cavern. Even the slithering stopped. Taking a deep breath, Christine looked side to side. Helpless and naked, she could only look up at the ceiling of the cave as several more of the slim, hairlike strands slowly and silently begin to lower towards her body. 

Her struggling arms began to tug and pull again, trying to escape. Her flesh glistening from the strain of effort, she started to weaken. Tired. Muscles nearly spent. A single tear fell as she wondered if her first mission would end in her demise at the-hands as it were-of this horrid creature. 

Several more of the thicker tentacles slithered up from under her, wrapping around her tummy. Around her thighs. Around her arms and one slowly coiled around her slender neck. Trapping her even more, and holding her squirming body still. The appendages warm, and despite the look of them, not slimy but strangely organic. Almost like warm ropes. 

Her eyes followed one strand that descended faster than the rest as it looked snake-like while making its way down. Her eyes never leaving it as it lowered, closer and closer, to her mouth. Then down past her tits and over her tummy. Between her legs. With a shock she watched as it thickened. Swelling. Taking form. Her eyes wide in shock as the very end of it opened, and she gasped as it took on the shape of a mouth. A small, round, perfectly formed mouth. Just big enough. Just big enough to make her gasp as it locked on to her clit and began to suck. 

Gasping, Christine looked up again, as all the rest of the strands started to descend faster. Each of them growing, and forming into... things. The sort of things Christine had only ever seen in her worst nightmares. 

CHAPTER 13-RACHEL 

Rachel watched, shocked that such a huge thing could possibly be attached to this evil little monkey's body. Squirming, or at least trying to squirm, the panties in her mouth keeping her protests silent, Rachel could only lay and try to breathe. She had given up trying to pull her arms or legs free, as tightly as she was strapped down it was quite impossible. 

"Yes yes, Master has been very generous with his gifts, very generous indeed," Hugo said as he stroked his inhuman appendage. The shaft riddled with veins and ribbed throughout. "Now you'll see how precise and thorough he is. How Master has been so kind to me," he told Rachel as he moved between her thighs. Rubbing the tip across her newly shaved slit, the end leaking precum like a faucet. 

Rachel, being no stranger to cock, lifted her head and her blue eyes opened wide as she saw how thick, and viscous his seeping fluids were already. Lubing her entrance as he rubbed his tip up and down her bald pussy. Her struggles began again as he pressed the tip to her cunt, just a bit. His head like an apple, ripe and juicy. 

"Now I promise this won't hurt Miss, you'll see," Hugo told her, as he began pushing in. The tip pressed her lips apart, and slipped inside her. Rachel gasped and squirmed, strapped down tight. The precum so copious his cock slid in easily. Slowly. Stretching her. 

The dwarf kept his eyes down, watching, as his cock slowly disappeared inside Rachel. Not seeing her pained look as he split her in two. Her high squeals filled the lab, as her blonde head tossed side to side. Spitting and choking, she forced her panties out of her mouth and spit them away. 

"Stop! Please stop,you're tearing me in half," Rachel pleaded. Hugo simply pushed more in, smiling to himself. "It's okay Miss, almost there, just a bit more," he told her. Pushing until finally, his balls rested against her. Heavy and full. 

"See Miss, I told you, not hurt at all," Hugo told Rachel as he slid almost all the way out, then back in again. Her back arched as much as the straps holding her body down allowed and she squealed. Rachel had never felt so full in her life. Then Hugo started to fuck her. 

The cruel little dwarf held Rachel's hips as he started sawing into her. Pumping her. His full balls slapping against her with every thrust. Her groans of pain lessening as she grew more and more accustomed to his girth. Her hands balled into fists and her teeth gritted, her eyes shut tightly to deny what was happening to her. 

Then her body flushed, and turned pink. Her pale flesh becoming nearly crimson and breaking out in a glistening sheen. 

"See Miss, I told you. You love what Master has done for me, as I said," Hugo told her. Smiling as he fucked her harder, making her gasp. "Ohhh my god," Rachel exclaimed. Her body betraying her to the long thick cock pounding into her. Hugo grinned and held his cock inside her, deep, enjoying the tight feel of Rachel's quim. 

"Just a little more, just a bit more," Hugo said. His hips began moving again, taking up a fast pace. Reaching down, he used his thumb to rub and massage Rachel's clit as he fucked her. This had the desired effect on the girl, as she began to squirm and moan louder. 

" Stop, please oh god, please," Rachel begged. Her body tensing up against what her mind was trying to deny. Her orgasm impending. "You have to stop, please stop," she moaned. As she gasped, her pussy clenched Hugo's cock tightly and she quaked in orgasm. The thickness of his cock putting her over the edge. 

With a sneer, Hugo pounded into her violently as his own orgasm approached. Then, with a groan, he filled her up. Spurt after spurt erupted from his cock, filling her womb. More cum than Rachel ever thought one set of balls could produce. As she lay, moaning, helpless and trembling. 

At long last, Hugo slid his member out of Rachel's swollen gaping pussy. Her lips red and sore. Wiping the tip on her thigh with a grin. "See Miss, I told you. Master was very precise with his gifts. You loved it, I can tell." 

Hugo put his cock away as Rachel lay panting. Reaching down to adjust the table, Rachel suddenly found herself vertical. Still strapped in a spread X, but now her body was upright. Hugo's cum running in a stream down her left inner thigh. She looked at him in disgust and he smiled back. 

"Master will be with you shortly Miss," he told her. She quaked with fear as he took a needle out and prepared an injection. "Please, no. What is that?" she asked in fear. Helpless as Hugo brought the needle to her thigh and pushed it in. Pressing down the plunger. 

"This is just something to ensure you remain calm, while Master visits you Miss," Hugo told her as he pulled the syringe out. Taking a minute to wipe her thigh clean, it very soon was wet from his leaking cum again. So much he had put in her, it was going to keep oozing out for some time.  

===

"Try to relax a bit Miss," Hugo told her. "And prepare for Master to come see you," he finished. Pushing the tray and smiling at her as he walked away. The injection already taking effect, Rachel could only weakly watch Hugo leave. 

And all she could even think to do or say was to weakly smile and whisper, "Bye." 

CHAPTER 14-BREE 

The sun was up now, bright and unforgiving. The jungle heat becoming more and more humid, as the air turned almost sticky. So it was that Bree was shiny with a layer of perspiration, sickly sweet sweat as the giant of a man slid his spent cock from her. As it slipped out a flood of thick cum spilled out. Bree only gasped and trembled. Still unable to believe she enjoyed what had just happened. Denying it. Hating her body for its natural reaction to a huge cock plundering her treasures. 

The dainty redhead was still trembling as the pirate put her down. Almost gently. Taking out a huge knife, he cut the binds around her neck and ankles. Releasing all but the panties keeping her wrists tied, he then put his cock away. 

"Alright you scum, the Captain wants us ready in one hour or so," he told the men gathered around. All stroking hard cocks. "So take your turns with her, enjoy her, and remember, noone fucks her ass," he ordered as he walked away. Grinning, the men picked her up and took her to the shade of the jungle. Laying her down on a small patch of grass, on her back. 

"Me first," said the pirate with the cock curved like a ripe banana. Pushing her thighs apart as he got between Bree's legs, he wasted no time in plunging into her well juiced up cunt. Bree gasped and her hips bucked, then he began to fuck her. 

Not wanting to waste time or be left out, another of the men got on his knees by her red haired head, holding her chin to open her mouth. And for the first time that day, not the last, Bree was tasting pirate dick. As she sucked, and was pounded into the ground, hands were mauling her pale tits. Pinching and twisting her pink nipples. Her protests muffled into slurping grunts as her mouth was stuffed again and again. 

For the next hour, Bree lost count of how many times the men changed positions. How many times cocks were switched from her red trimmed slit, to her suckling mouth and back again. Her nipples sore from so much pulling and twisting. The men fucked her in every position they could think of. At one point, poor dainty Bree had two cocks stuffed in her tight snatch at once. At another point she had two different poles stuffing her mouth at once. 

Bree also lost count of how many orgasms she achieved. Her nerves were shot from cumming too many times and her heart was beating out of her chest. Her pale skin flushed, bruised, filthy from the jungle floor. 

At long last, near the end, the men started finishing. One by one. Each one into her mouth. And Bree swallowed. Every load swallowed down, choked down, gobbled down. As the last man finished and Bree gulped down his sperm, the huge pirate returned. 

"Did you have fun girly?" he asked her. Bree could only glare up at him. Her body sore in every place. He merely smiled back at her as he picked her up and tossed her over his shoulder. Taking her like a sack of grain onto her own shuttle, now crewed by pirates. 

He tossed her onto the floor and flipped her onto her tummy. Using his knife again, he cut her wrists free. "We have a bit of time before we reach our mother ship girly, you best get cleaned up. Maybe put on some clothes," he told her. "The Captain will want you clean when he meets you, and this is the only chance you'll get," he said. Bree, rubbing her sore wrists and glaring up at him. "By the by, my name is Jericho, but you may call me Jer." 

Bree thought to herself, "I'll remember that when I put a laser bolt through that skull of yours, Jer." Then, having a bit of time to clean up, Bree used the shuttle's hydrowash. Letting the reclaimed water run down all over her body, she broke out in tears. The only disturbance, she was lucky enough to realize, was the shuttle lifting off. 

Wiping her tears, Bree promised to find some means of escape. Some means to get away, get back here, and pick up Christine and Rachel. The guilt of leaving them marooned was overwhelming, even though it wasn't her fault. 

Biting back more tears, she thought of how her body reacted to being gang banged. Her orgasms. Her ecstasy. And more shame coursed through her. She shouldn't have enjoyed it, she thought. She shouldn't have let them do that, she thought. And worst of all, she shouldn't be hoping it happens again. 

Stepping out of the wash, and wrapping a clean towel around her, Bree looked out of the small porthole. The familiar blackness of space greeted her. So soon to be in orbit. As she looked out, she saw a second shuttle join up with her own. The pirate's landing craft, flying in tandem back to the pirate marauder. 

Taking Bree to her unknown fate... 

CHAPTER 15-CHRISTINE 

Christine moaned softly as the little mouth sucked on her clit relentlessly, bringing blood to the surface and making it swell. Her eyes watching the strands as they descended. Changing. Turning. Almost in slow motion, swelling and pulsing. Somewhere in the back of her mind she became aware of the gurgling and chittering again. Sounding almost amused, almost evil. 

As she watched, the next two strands also changed. Becoming like the first, forming into small perfect little mouths. Helpless to do anything but squirm, she watched the tentacles become mouths and attatch to her dark little nipples. Her perky tits lifted up as they began to suck. Making her gasp anew. 

Christine tilted her head back and whimpered. The tentacles sucking her nipples and clit having the desired effect. Making her body ready, willing, and wet. The tentacles wrapped around her arms and legs tightened to keep her still as the next one came down in front of her face. The thin strand thickening, growing. In silent and complete horror she watched as it took the shape of a long cock. Then, like a serpent striking, it lunged forward. Catching Christine completely by surprise, she found herself with a full mouth. As it rested on her tongue, she felt it grow thicker. Longer. Harder. With a groan she realized her mouth was full of cock. Pumping and thrusting, fucking her mouth and forcing her to suck. 

Then, as if that wasn't enough, two more of the strands lowered to her body. Slowly and inexorably between her legs. Unable to look down at what was happening, she missed seeing them dance and twist as they took shape. One becoming a thick and veiny cock, the other becoming a slim but long and smooth protrusion. 

Christine couldn't see them, but she could feel them, as the two protrusions rubbed against her body. Leaking a thick white substance. Making her body wet and shiny. She moaned in protest around the cock in her mouth. If it could be called a cock, only the end of the tentacle resembled anything like a penis. Then the ropy grip on her legs and wrists pulled, spreading her even wider. Christine was stretched to the fullest, her limbs spread wide, before she was stretched again, in a different way. 

Helpless, she felt the two entrances to her body rubbed by the wet, slippery tentacle ends. Both her holes teased and pressed against. The one in her mouth slowly pumping in and out. "Mphh...mphhh..mphhh," she said. Her moans muffled. Then, her squeals muffled as both holes were penetrated. 

The ends of the tentacles, shaped like long cocks, slid into her, stretching her. Christine gasped, her body helpless and held tight, as they began to slowly fuck her. The one in her mouth leaking the same thick white ooze. With no choice, Christine began to swallow. 

Her body covered in the thick white slime, as more of it filled her tummy, Christine could only moan, wrapped in tentacles, one in her ass and one in her pussy. Fucking her and pumping into her mercilessly. The little tentacle mouths sucking her nipples and clit began to do their job, as she experienced her first orgasm. 

The first of many.
