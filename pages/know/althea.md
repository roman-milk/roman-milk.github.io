===

I should have known better. I should have remembered that old saying, "If it looks too good to be true, it is." 

I was in love. She was damned near all I thought about with the exception of my studies and it didn't make sense to me. I prided myself on my intellect and my ability to think logically, but there wasn't anything logical about the way I felt about Althea. She was beautiful, smart and very popular and I was not. I wasn't a bed looking guy, but I was nothing exceptional. I was smart, but popular was something I had never been and probably would never be. Not that I didn't want to be, but for some reason shy, nerdy types like me were avoided. I didn't play sports; all I did was study and concentrate on my passion - computers and the wondrous things that you can do with them. 

Althea changed boyfriends like I got haircuts - every couple of weeks. She went from guy to guy - all jocks and all what I have heard girls refer to as 'hunks' - like a honeybee flitting from flower to flower. At the time it didn't occur to me to wonder about the fact that maybe two-thirds of them were black. Outside of a couple of shared classes I had absolutely nothing in common with Althea so it was totally illogical of me to even waste a minute thinking about her. Still, for my sophomore and junior years I watched her and wished that I could be one of the guys she spent time with. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was the start of my senior year when the miracle occurred. I was at the library doing research on a paper that I had to turn in. I was sitting at a table pouring over reference material when Althea walked up to the table and asked me if she could sit down. I was so surprised that I was tongue tied, but no way I was going to say no so I just motioned to one of the chairs. 

"We hardly know each other" she said, "So you probably are not aware that I can sometimes be blunt almost to the point of being insulting. This is probably one of those times. Are you gay?" 

I was caught totally off guard by the question and I just sat there opened mouthed and started at her. After an embarrassingly long silence she said, "Not a hard question, a simple yes or no would do." 

"No, no I'm not" I managed to croak out. 

"Next question. I've watched you watch me for the last couple of years now yet you have never any attempt to get to know me. Why is that?" 

The situation was just so totally bizarre that I just sat there. 

"Not much of a conversationalist are you. Well, let me give me my thoughts on it. I figured that it was one of two things. One, you were gay and you were watching me running around with the hunks that you wanted for yourself, but you say that you aren't gay so that takes me to number two. You are shy, shy and unsure of yourself. Shy with maybe a touch of an inferiority complex. Is that it? Too shy and afraid that you wouldn't measure up against football and basketball players?" 

It was too much, too fast, and I was overwhelmed; the words just would not come out. 

"Come on Herb, help me out here. Don't make me do it all." 

"Do it all?" I managed to blurt out. 

"Yes, do it all. You won't come to me so I had to come to you. I'm sitting here giving you opportunities up the kazoo to jump in and say something, but you are just sitting there like a lump. You are not doing my ego much good here Herb." 

"I'm sorry, I...I... just don't know what to say." 

"Not used to forceful, assertive women Herb, or just not used to women at all?" 

"I...I... I haven't much experience with women." 

"Okay, I guess I will have to do it all." 

She slid a piece of paper across the table to me, "That's my address. Pick me up at seven. I have a party to go to and I need an arm to hang on." 

"I...I can't. I have a paper due and I need to finish it tonight." 

"Bullshit Herb. Your GPA is a solid four point oh and you are the darling of every professor whose class you take. You could turn in a paper that simply said, "I hate this class" and you would still get an A on it. Seven Herb" and she stood up and gathered up her purse and her books. She turned to go and then she turned back to me. 

"And Herb? Wear a tie. First dates need to be just a touch formal, don't you think?" 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I watched her walk away and wondered just what in the hell had happened. 

I was there to pick her up at seven and I did wear a tie. We went to the party and I spent four hours being stared at by people who were just as curious about what was going on as I was. A couple of times a guy tried to separate Althea from me and get her to leave with him, but she just said that she didn't think that her boyfriend would like that. Boyfriend? I was absolutely lost about what was going on. 

The party over I took Althea home and walked her to her door. She smiled, patted me on the cheek and said, "I don't kiss on the first date Herbie; it gives the guy something to look forward to on the next date. For us that will be day after tomorrow. Dinner and a movie. Pick me up at six" and she went inside. 

Since it was only Wednesday (Thursday early AM actually) I had a day and a half to try and figure what was going on, but by five o'clock on Friday evening I still didn't have a clue. I suppose that I could have just come out and asked her, but why should I do that? For years I had watched her with no expectation of ever even speaking to her and here she was telling people that I was her boyfriend. I was going to jeopardize that? No way. I might only last a week or maybe not even that long, but I was going to take what I could get. 

I was there to pick her up at five-fifty and her hello was accompanied by a bemused smile. 

"A little eager are we?" 

"No, I just hate to be late." 

"It's a good trait Herbie, being eager I mean. I've made reservations at Lascars and I hope you like 'chic flicks' because I'm dying to see First Wives Club." 

She looked at her watch and then at me and smiled as she said, "Don't worry Herbie, I didn't order your entrâ€še too." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Dinner was nice and we used the time to find out more about each other. The movie wasn't my cup of tea, but I would have happily sat through a foreign film with sub-titles as long as I could be with Althea. When I took her home and walked her to her door she thanked me for a lovely time, gave me a kiss that turned my bones to jelly and told me to pick her up at one on Saturday. I drove to my place with a head full of thoughts and questions and the only thing I was sure about was that I was totally confused. The girl of my dreams had taken me out on two dates and had just set up a third one and I had not even asked her out for the first time. What's more, as I recall it, I never did ever ask her out. Althea ended every date we had setting up the next one. She took charge of my life and I was so happy that I never said a word, never questioned it, not once. 

The next four dates ended with kisses on her front porch, each one just a little longer than the previous one. The next dozen or so ended with necking sessions in the car that seemed to get hotter and hotter until one night she unbuttoned her blouse to show me that she wasn't wearing a bra. She took my hands and carried them to her breasts, "Show them that you like them Herbie." I played with them for a while and then Althea pulled my head down to them. 

"Work the nipples Herbie, lick my nipples." 

I did and she started moaning and her hands grabbed the back of my head and held me to her. I moved a hand up her leg and she slapped it away, "Don't get greedy Herbie, all in good time." 

The next three dates ended the same way - I got to pay homage to her tits - but the next one, when I reached for her breasts, she pushed my hands away. "No Herbie, not tonight. Tonight it is your turn" and her hand went for my fly, she pulled down the zipper and reached inside for my cock. Things moved quickly after that. I got a hand job on that night and on the next two. Then one night I picked her up and as we headed for the car Althea asked me for the keys. 

"I'll drive tonight Herbie." 

Fifteen minutes later we were in a motel parking lot. I looked over at her and she looked back at me and smiled, "It is called escalation Herbie, moving on to bigger and better. You aren't a virgin, are you?" 

The look on my face answered that one only too well. 

"Good! I love taking cherries and teaching guys the right way to do things." 

I don't know why, but those words and the tone of voice she used in saying them made me finally ask the question that had been waiting to be asked since that day in the library. 

"What is going on here Althea?" 

"It is a compatibility check Herbie." 

"Compatibility check? I don't understand." 

"In almost all areas you are a perfect fit for me Herbie. The only thing left for me to check is whether or not we are sexually compatible." 

"And if we aren't?" 

"Then obviously I won't marry you." 

She opened the door and started to get out of the car, "Come on Herbie, let's see if we have a future." 

We were married two months after graduation. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Almost everyone who knows Althea and me considers me pussy whipped. It is true, but at the same time it isn't. Yes, I do appear to be subservient to Althea's wishes and desires. "Yes dear" and "Of course dear" play a large part in my conversations with Althea, both in public and at home, but it is not because I am pussy whipped, it is because I just don't care or because it just doesn't matter. I was in the market for a new car and Althea picked out the one that I bought. 

"It gives great gas mileage and has a very high safety rating, and besides, it fits the image you need to project if you want to get ahead at work." 

What did I care? I'd never had any particular interest in cars and the one she picked got me from point A to point B just fine. She picked out my clothes, but as far as I was concerned that just meant that I didn't have to do it. If she had said, "Herbie, I'm going to paint the dining room walls black, put two white horizontal stripes through the middle of it and a yellow vertical stripe just to the right of center" I would have said, "That's nice dear" because I just did not care about things like that. 

The friends we had were the ones she picked for us, but so what? I'd never had many friends anyway. Althea picked our activities and again, so what? Before we got married I'd never done much except study and play with computers so whether it was opera or line dancing it was all new to me and if it kept Althea happy, I was happy. Althea got her way ninety percent of the time and always it was over things that I just did not care about. Althea did not get her way when it did come to things I cared about and that is what counted for me. When I furnished my home office Althea wanted cherrywood for the desk and bookshelves and I wanted oak so oak is what I got. For our home computer Althea wanted a Mac and I wanted an IBM clone so a clone is what we got. So I got my way on the things that counted to me and Althea got her way on all the rest. If that makes me seem pussy whipped or hen pecked so be it. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The marriage was trouble free, from my standpoint anyway, for eight years, seven months and two days and then I made the mistake of coming home unexpectedly. Not that I would have called ahead anyway because Althea was supposed to be at work. I'd gone to an early lunch with my boss and something that I ate apparently gave me a slight touch of food poisoning and the boss told me to take the rest of the day off. When I got home Althea'' car was in the driveway and I wondered why she was at home and not at work. I didn't have to wonder long because as soon as I opened the front door I heard, "...me damn it, fuck me hard." 

I quietly closed the door and went and looked in the living room. Althea was bent over the arm of the couch. Her dress was up around her waist, her panty was dangling from her left foot and a black man was fucking her from behind. I watched as the black man pounded into Althea's pussy and she urged him on. 

"Hurry lover, hurry, make me cum. We have to get back to work, hurry baby, get me off, hurry." 

I should have been mad. I suppose that I should have exploded in anger and rushed into the room, but I didn't. I leaned against the doorframe and watched. Finally the black man noticed me and he abruptly stopped fucking Althea and pulled out. He set himself in a stance to ward off an attack and waited for me to do something. As soon as he stopped fucking her and pulled out Althea started crying, "Don't stop damn it, I'm almost there, don't stop, get me off." 

When he didn't answer or come back Althea lifted herself up and looked over her shoulder and saw me. Her face went pale. She got up off the couch and said, "We need to hurry back to work Jerome" as she straightened her dress and pulled on her panties. Then she looked at me and said, "This is nothing for you to worry about Herb. We will talk about it when I get home from work tonight." 

"Nothing for me to worry about? I come home and fi..." 

"Not now Herb, I have to get back to work. Tonight we will talk" and she headed for the front door. Jerome kept a wary eye on me as he followed her and I could not resist a little sarcasm. 

"Be cool dude. You heard her, It's nothing for me to worry about and we are going to talk about it when she gets home." 

As I watched Althea back down the driveway I wondered why I wasn't more upset about the situation than I was. I think it was because the moment I saw Jerome ram his cock in Althea I realized that we were never supposed to get together in the first place. Something had shifted in the space/time continuum just long enough to knock things off their planned course. Althea was supposed to keep hanging with her black football and basketball players and I was probably supposed to stay a confirmed bachelor, but something weird happened and Althea ended up at my library table. 

Well, it was easily enough corrected. I would see a lawyer in the next day or two and get the ball rolling, but first I had to figure out what I was going to do to Althea and quite possibly Jerome if he was stupid enough to keep hanging around. Althea was about to see a side of her husband that she never knew existed. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

In keeping with the calm way that Althea had reacted when I caught her in the act of cuckolding me and my own demeanor after catching them, I had dinner ready and waiting when she got home, complete with a bottle of wine opened and 'breathing' on the kitchen counter. I assumed that Althea would keep to her regular schedule, especially in light of what had happened and she didn't disappoint me. Show no fear could have been her motto. She entered the kitchen calm and self assured as always, saw the preparations that I had made and I saw just the faintest trace of a smile at the corner of her eyes and I could read her mind - "This is going to be easier than I thought." 

She poured herself a glass of wine, took a sip and said, "I'm sorry that you had to walk in on that today, but you never come home during the day. Still, I should have planned for something like that, it's just that motel rooms are just so tacky." 

"I'm sorry that I walked in on it too. Motel rooms might be tacky, but I would have much rather have had you suffer through tacky than for me to come home to what I came home to. It isn't every day that a man who thought he was happily married comes home to find out that he isn't." 

"Herbie, I told you that you had nothing to worry about. I have no intention of leaving you for Jerome. My god Herbie, it was just a fling. You are my man Herbie and you should know that. I love you and you should know that too." 

"That was a very strange way of displaying your love for me." 

"I said I was sorry and I am. I should have taken Jerome to a motel or a hotel." 

"How long has it been going on?" 

"Jerome? About two weeks now." 

"The way you answered that makes me think that Jerome isn't the first." 

Althea was silent for a moment or two and then she said, "He isn't." 

"How many and for how long?" 

I don't remember how many right off hand, but it has been going on since before I met you." 

"Would you care to explain that?" 

"Not really, but I guess I have to. It goes all the way back to high school. I went to a victory party after a football game and had a bit too much to drink. I woke up the next morning between two black football players. As soon as I was awake they treated me pretty much the same as they had when I was drunk, like a white trash whore. I can't explain why it turned me on, but it did and I've had a taste for black meat ever since. 

"So why did you marry me if what you really wanted was black men? 

"At first it didn't matter Herb. I only married you for your potential. As far as looks go you weren't bad, but you weren't all that great either. All the guys I ran with in college had it all over you in the looks department. Good looking, hard bodies, good in the sack, but that was all they had. I could predict the future for every one of them. They would become gas station attendants, convenience store clerks and used car salesmen. A couple would have gone into professional sports, blown out a knee and ended up selling real estate. I didn't want that. I wanted some one who was going to make something of himself. I looked around and there you were and I went after you. I'd have my security and I'd have my hard bodies on the side. 

"Then things got complicated. I fell in love with you. What complicated things even more was that I found out that even though I loved you I couldn't break myself away from my hard bodies. And I found out that it wasn't just the hard bodies I couldn't break away from, it was black hard bodies. I don't know if it was the black/white taboo thing or what, but I was hung up on black men. 

"The first year of our marriage I fought off the urge, but every time I saw a black man I would feel a tingle in my crotch and then one day I ran into one of my old boyfriends at Wal-Mart, he was working there - I had read his potential right - and we ended up at a motel. When I came home that night I felt guilty as hell and even though you didn't know I'd cheated on you I did my best to fuck your eyes out to make it up to you. You never suspected a thing and I let it happen again and I've been doing it ever since, but I swear to you Herb, they don't mean shit to me. They are just feeding my habit. You are my man Herb, you are the one I love and want to live my life with. 

"So the entire we have been married you have been hanging horns on me with niggers." 

"No, not the entire time. It is an occasional thing. I know that it is self- destructive behavior so I quit doing it, but after five or six months the craving drives me crazy and I find a black man and have an affair. After a couple of weeks I break it off and in six or so months the cycle starts all over again. It is just a fling Herbie. It doesn't threaten our marriage at all. If anything, it helps." 

"Oh? And may I ask just how?" 

"Whenever I'm having one of my flings the number of times you and I have sex in a week increases." 

"And that is because it turns you on to be giving me sloppy seconds?" 

"No Herbie, I would never do that to you. Well, that's not exactly true. It did happen once and I felt so guilty about it that I never let it happen again. I always shower and douche before I come to you Herbie, always. The reason it causes our sex life to increase is because I leave my black lover knowing that all he is is a fuck, but that I'm going home to a man whom I love and who is going to make fantastic love to me. This isn't about hurting you or shaming you. I love you Herb, I really do. My thing for blacks is just an itch that I have to occasionally scratch. We have been together almost nine years Herb and it has been going on all that time and it hasn't hurt us a bit and there is no reason that it should bother us now that you know."  

===

"That sounds suspiciously like you intend to keep on doing it." 

"Of course I do Herb. I already pointed out that it hasn't hurt us." 

"So I'm just supposed to say "Yes dear" and turn a blind eye to it?" 

"Yes honey, exactly." 

"Just what kind of man do you think I am Althea? You really think I can just sit back and let you fuck blacks whenever you feel like it?" 

"Yes Herb, that is exactly what I think. You love me and if you expect to keep me you will indulge me my little quirk." 

"So you don't really love me after all." 

"Don't be silly baby, of course I do." 

"You just as good as told me that if I don't let you fuck blacks you are going to leave me. That sure is some strong love you got if you can do that." 

Althea looked at me for a moment or two and then she stood up. "I'm going upstairs to shower and douche. You want me to wear my heels when you come up to make love to me?" 

This was not ending the way I wanted and I needed to change the mood in order for what I wanted to do to work. "We aren't done here yet Althea. We still have something that needs to be talked about." 

"What?" 

"Haven't you wondered why I didn't lose it when I came in a found you with Jerome?" 

"No, I can't say that I did. You have always been a calm and rational person Herb, it is one of your strengths." 

"Rationality had nothing to do with it Althea. The fact is that I found the black skin on white skin to be very erotic and the entire time I watched I wished that you and Jerome had been completely naked instead of just partially." 

"Really? It turned you on?" 

"So much so that I want to see it again." 

"What do you mean?" 

I mean I want to watch you and Jerome go at it naked. I want to watch from start to finish." 

Althea looked at me with a look of amazement on her face. "Oh my god Herbie. All these years and I never knew that you had a kinky side." 

"I didn't know either until my dick got hard watching you and Jerome. When did you plan on seeing him again?" 

"Tomorrow at lunch." 

"No, not at lunch. Call him and tell him that we fought when you got home and that I moved out. Then bring him home from work with you tomorrow after work. You can fuck him all night if you want, I just want to be able to watch." 

"I don't know if I can get him to go for that." 

"He'll never know I'm here. I'll be watching from the closet." 

"You have any more surprises for me Herbie? Would you like me now before I shower? Would you like sloppy seconds? Maybe you would like to eat my pussy before I douche?" 

"No, I don't think so. One small step at a time. Let's see how I feel after watching you and Jerome." 

"Okay Herbie, you got it, but you still haven't answered my question." 

"What question was that?" 

"You want me in heels after I shower and douche?" 

I looked at her and quickly decided that since it was going to be the last time and since I needed for her to be in the right frame of mind when she brought Jerome home I should do my best to make her feel comfortable with the situation. 

"Heels Althea, heels, nylons and garter belt." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was watching from the bedroom window when Althea pulled into the drive and I saw her and Jerome get out of the car. I moved into the closet and waited and in about five minutes the two of them came into the bedroom. I watched as they engaged in some steamy French kissing and as Althea did a strip tease for her black lover. Once she was naked she went over to Jerome and knelt down in front of him and helped him get his trousers and briefs off. The minute his cock leapt free she captured it with her mouth and I do have to admit that it was erotic as hell and it did make my cock hard, but I wasn't in the closet for voyeurism, I was in there for payback! 

I waited until Jerome was naked and the both of them were on the bed before I came out of the closet. Althea was the first to see me and her face lost its color at the sight of the gun. 

"Herb, wha..." 

"Just shut the fuck up you cheating whore." 

"But you sa..." 

"Forget what I said Althea. You've been lying to me for nine years now so you can't get upset if I lie to you." 

I waved the gun at Jerome and tossed two sets of handcuffs to Althea. 

"Lie face down on the bed Jerome and stretch your arms out to the bed posts. Althea, you take the cuffs and cuff his wrists to the bed posts." 

"Hey man, no fucking way I'm going along with this shit." 

"You go along Jerome, or you die. Here's the way it goes down if you don't do what I tell you. The gun can't be traced back to me so here is the story I tell the cops when they come to haul your dead body away. I came home from work and I found a nigger raping my wife. I rushed him and he snatched up the gun that he had used to force my wife to undress. I got to him before he could fire at me and we struggled and the gun went off. The shot went wild and killed my wife and then I got the gun away from the rapist and backed away from him and told him to lie down on the floor and spread eagle himself while I called the cops. Instead he rushed me and I shot him. I didn't mean to kill him, just wound him, but I'm not that experienced with firearms and I ended up shooting him dead." 

"It will never work man. Too many people at work know that your old lady is fucking me." 

"People at work Jerome, but not the poor husband whose back you have been going behind. He doesn't know that you weren't raping her and that the gun was for your protection in case I came home early. I really thought she was being raped. I'm betting I can pull it off Jerome. You want to bet otherwise that's up to you, but you'll be dead so you won't ever know if you won the bet, will you?" 

Althea was sobbing and she cried, "You won't hurt me Herb, you can't hurt me. You love me Herb, please, you love me and you won't hurt me." 

"Sorry Althea, but is up to your boyfriend here. For my story to work you have to be dead." 

"Oh God. Do what he says Jerome, please do what he says." 

Jerome gave me a hard look, "This ain't going to end good for you white boy. No matter what you do sooner or later I'm going to fuck you up." 

"I'm just terrified Jerome. Now, on the bed face down" and I clicked the hammer back on the gun, "Or die." 

He gave me a mean look, but he did what I told him. Althea cuffed him to the bed and then I had her sit in a chair and I cuffed her to it. Althea was still crying and she wanted to know what I was going to do. 

"I'm going to show Jerome what happens when somebody fucks around with something that was mine." 

I went back in the closet and came out with a bag. I took a beer bottle and a tube of KY out of the bag and set them on the nightstand. 

"You ever been fucked in the ass Jerome?" 

He started to struggle and thrash around, but his wrists were too tightly secured to the bedposts. 

"Here's the way it is going to work Jerome. See this beer bottle? Notice the chip on the lip of the bottle and the crack in the neck? I had to work on thirty-one bottles Jerome, just to get one the way I wanted it. I'm going to do one of two things here. I'm going to fuck your ass with this beer bottle until my arms get tired. I'm hoping that it will break while I'm doing it and that it cuts the hell out of your insides. You I expect, will be praying to God that it doesn't break." 

I held the bottle in front of his face and tapped the neck of the bottle with the gun barrel and the crack lengthened. "Damn, I'd better not do that any more. I want it to break inside you, not outside." I reached for the tube of KY, "At least I'm not going to ram it in dry Jerome." 

"Hey man, don't do this. It ain't right man, it ain't fair. She come after me man, I didn't go chasing after her. It ain't right that you do this to me." 

"Sorry Jerome, but you fucked my wife and even after I found out about it yesterday you were still going to do her again at lunch today. You fuck my wife, you pay the price." 

"No man, not that, please man, don't do that. I'll do anything man, but don't do nothing with the beer bottle." 

"Anything Jerome? Okay, I'll give you a choice. You fucked my wife so I'm going to fuck you - that's a given Jerome - either with my cock or with the beer bottle. Does that sound better Jerome? Would you rather I cornhole you than fuck you with a beer bottle?" 

"Oh man, please man, don't do this to me." 

"Your choice Jerome, strictly your choice." 

I opened the tube of KY and started spread some on the neck of the bottle and then I grabbed the cheek of his ass. 

"OH God man, no, not the beer bottle man, not the fucking bottle." 

"Does that mean you are choosing my dick?" 

"Not the bottle man, please, not the bottle." 

"Tell me Jerome" I said as I ran the neck of the bottle over the bare skin of his ass. 

"Your dick man, use your dick." 

"Say it like you really mean it Jerome." 

"Use your dick man. Fuck my ass with your dick." 

"Say please Jerome." 

"Please man, fuck my ass with your dick." 

When it was over I walked over to Althea. "Now it's your turn. Clean my cock" and I pushed my slime-covered cock at her face. 

"No!" she said as she turned her face away. I grabbed a handful of her hair and turned her face back to me and then I pinched her nose till she opened her mouth to breathe and then I shoved my filthy cock into the open hole. 

"The sooner you get it done the sooner the ordeal is over." 

I had both hands on the back of her head to keep her from getting away. 

"Do it the easy way or I hold you and just fuck your face. Do it the easy way and you have some control. I do it and it is liable to hurt when I try to shove myself all the way down your throat. Blink your eyes three times if you want control." 

A couple of seconds went by and then she blinked three times. I told her to get to it and I kept her at it until I felt the twitch that told me that my cock wanted to get hard again and then I pulled it out of her mouth. I walked over to the closet and reached up on the shelf for the video camera I had set there and I brought it out and showed it to Jerome. 

"When I get done doing the edit all you will see is you asking me to take your ass and then me doing it while you lay there taking it. If I ever see you again Jerome the tape will go public. I'll flood your work place with copies and I'll put it up on the Internet. I'll find out who your friends are and I send all of them copies. Get scarce and stay scarce Jerome." 

I unlocked the cuffs holding Althea to the chair and then I gave her the keys to Jerome's cuffs. 

"Unlock him, get dressed and then both of you get out of here." 

I walked out of the bedroom and went down the stairs and went into the den. I sat in the chair with the gun ready and waited to see if Jerome was stupid enough to come after me. Ten minutes later I heard the front door open and then close and then I heard a car door slam. I watched from a window as the two of them drove off together. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was propped up in bed reading a book when I heard a car pull in the drive and then the front door open and close. I heard steps coming up the stairs and, since I still expected Jerome to do something stupid, I reached over to the nightstand and got the gun. I put it under the covers, but pointing in the direction of the bedroom door and waited. The door opened and Althea walked in, stopped and looked at me. 

"I never knew that you could be such a bastard." 

"You never gave me call to be one before." 

"Did you have to humiliate Jerome like that?" 

"Yep." 

"For God's sake why? He was telling you the truth. I did go after him, he didn't come after me." 

"Hold out your left hand." Althea did it and I asked, "What do you see?" 

"What am I looking for?" 

"Why don't you tell me what you see." 

"Just my weddi...oh." 

"That's right, your wedding rings. Right there where Jerome could see them. You might have gone after him, but he knew you were married and he fucked you anyway. Fucking another man's woman can be a chancy business. He got lucky; some other husband might have killed him." 

"You know that it will be very awkward for me to work with him now." 

"Not my problem." 

"What you made me do was disgusting. How could you have done something like that to me?" 

"You're lucky that that is all I did. Why are you here? When I gave you the keys to set Jerome loose I specifically said for both of you to get out." 

"Yes you did, but that was heat of the moment Herbie, you know that you really didn't mean it." 

"Of course I meant it Althea. You have lied to me for almost nine years now and you have been cheating on me just as long. I don't need you in my life anymore." 

"Look Herb, I know that it isn't going to be easy, but we will get by this. I do love you, even if you don't believe it right this moment, and I'm keeping you." 

I started to say something, but Althea held up her hand, "Don't bother Herb, it will be a waste of time and breath. We both know that you love me and that I usually get what I want so don't try to fight it. I'm not letting you get away from me. You can tell me to leave, but I won't. If you leave I will just follow. I'm keeping you Herbie, get used to it. It will take a lot of hard work on my part, but I will prove to you that you are mine and that I am yours. Junkies have kicked the drug habit and alcoholics do stop drinking. I know that there is no such thing as Black Men Anonymous to help me get over my craving for black meat, but I will get over it, I swear it." 

She started to undress. 

"Is it too soon for you to want to make love to me? I hope not; watching Herbie the bastard in action made me horny." 

She climbed on the bed, "Scoot over" she said as she reached for my cock. Report_Story
