===

There are some that say that revenge is a waste of valuable time; time that could be put to more productive use doing other things. To me and to my way of thinking good mental health requires payback when you are fucked over. You have a choice: In ten or fifteen years you can look back and say, "Damn it! I should have......" or you can look back and smile at what you did. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Tricia and I had dated and gone steady for a year and a half in high school and near the end of our junior year she dumped me for our teams starting quarterback. He - Danny - wasn't too bright or he never would have gotten together with her. I think he started to get the message the Friday night we played the Ypsilanti Braves and the right guard stepped aside and let his man through. The right guard (moi) did it three more times before I was pulled from the game and benched. By then Danny's bell had been rung once too often and he was pulled because he couldn't seem to get it together after that. Marty, the second stringer, went on in Danny's place, had one hell of a game and we beat Ypsi 24-21, but my football career was over. 

The coach ripped me a new asshole for what I had done and threw me off the team, but not before asking me why. I told him straight up why I had done it and that I'd do it again if I had the chance. He called Danny in and asked him if it were true that he'd stolen my girlfriend and Danny puffed up his chest and cracked wise: 

"It ain't my fault if he can't hang on to his women." 

The coach just looked at Danny and then he shook his head and then said: 

"Son, that's a team out there. You have to play together to win and to do that you need to be tight with your teammates. You just don't fuck over your teammates." 

And he threw Danny off the team also. It ended up costing us both a chance at a football scholarship. It didn't hurt me because my parents could afford to send me to college, but Danny's couldn't. Danny was so pissed at being thrown off the team that he told Tricia to go to hell. She came crawling back to me and I told her to fuck off and die. Danny was popular and getting him thrown off the team pissed a lot of people off and Tricia (who got the blame instead of me) did not have a happy rest of her Junior year and she did not have all that good a time as a Senior either. She was the only girl in the senior class that didn't get asked to the prom. 

There was one more unpleasant outcome from the mess. I tried out for football at Eastern Michigan as a walk on, but the coach didn't even give me a look. He told me he knew all about what I'd done and that no one with an attitude like that was ever going to play for him. 

In a way it was probably a good thing since without football to get in the way I was able to knuckle down and graduate with a 3.91 GPA and that made me attractive to the XYZ Corporation and I went to work for them one week after being handed my sheepskin. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I didn't see Tricia after I left high school. Where I'd gone to Eastern Michigan she had gone to the University of Michigan. My second day at XYZ I was sitting in the cafeteria looking over the choices I had to make on the insurance package when someone sat down across from me and set their tray on the table. I looked up from my paperwork and saw Tricia. She looked me right in the eye and said: 

"Are you going to say hi?" 

I looked at her for several seconds, said "Hi" and then went back to looking over my insurance benefits paperwork. 

"Still holding a grudge?" 

"I said hi. That's what you asked for and I gave it to you. Now, if you don't mind, I need to make my choices and turn the paperwork in." 

"Okay, let's try it this way. I asked for a hi and you gave me what I asked for. While you are in a giving mood I'm going to ask you to forgive a stupid teenager for being a stupid teenager. Rob, we all did things that we regret doing when we were in junior high and high school. I screwed up. I'm sorry. Can't we at least be friends?" 

I looked at her sitting across from me, still the best looking girl that ever went out with me and I figured, "What the hell, it can't hurt to be just friends" so I said: 

"Okay. We can be friends." 

She smiled and stuck out her hand and said, "Shake?" I took it and shook it and eleven months later I took her hand again and slid a ring on her finger as I said, "I do." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next five years went by fast. Tricia and I decided that we wanted to wait for a while before having kids. We had places we wanted to go and things we wanted to do and we wanted to be a little more stable financially before starting a family. We sank all of our energy into each other and our jobs. We bought a three-bedroom house because we knew that one-day we were going to have children. We got passports and spent our vacations traveling and seeing the world. 

By the end of that five-year period I began talking with Tricia about starting a family, but she told me she wasn't ready just yet. She had just been promoted to manager in her department and she had some things she wanted to do, some changes she wanted to make to make the department more efficient and to "leave her stamp" on it. I knew how she felt because I'd been made a section manager six months before and I'd had the same feelings. 

I didn't really like her new job because she had to travel and would be gone for two or three days on the average of twice a month. But she loved her job and was happy so I decided not to push for kids until she hit 'the wall.' You do know about 'the wall' right? Every company that has been in business for a long time has a 'wall.' It is called the "Because that is the way we have always done it" wall. I knew that the entrenched bureaucracy would resist all the changes she wanted to make and eventually she would give up fighting them and at that point she would be ready to consider children. If my own experience at trying to make changes was any yardstick I only had about six months to wait. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Tricia had just left for a three day trip to Atlanta and I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with my evenings while she was gone when my boss buzzed me and asked me to come into his office. He told me that there was a problem at our Charlotte facility and asked me to fly down and take a look. Naturally I said yes and he told me he would have his secretary make the arrangements. She called me at noon and told me she had me set up with a two- ten flight and that I would have to change planes in Atlanta. I told her about Tricia being in Atlanta and asked that since I had to change planes in Atlanta and wouldn't get in to Charlotte until too late to go into the office that she reschedule me. I'd overnight in Atlanta, spend the evening with Tricia and catch the first flight out to Charlotte in the morning. She called me back twenty minutes later and gave me the new arrangements. 

I arrived in Atlanta and took the hotel courtesy bus to the hotel where Tricia was staying. I called her room from the lobby and got no answer so I asked the desk clerk for a key. After checking my driver's license information against Tricia's registration information she gave me a key card and I headed up to the room. It was my intention to surprise her when she came into the room, but I was the one who was surprised. 

I entered the room and the first thing I thought was that I was in the wrong room. There were men's clothes hanging on the clothes bar and I was just about to back out of the room when I saw the monogrammed luggage I had given Tricia when she was promoted. I closed the door and looked around the room and found enough of Tricia's things to convince me that I was in her room all right. One look at the unmade bed with the wet spot in the middle told me the rest of the story. I took one last look around and then left. 

I went down to the lobby and went into the gift shop and bought a copy of that day's Atlanta Constitution to hide behind and went out and sat down in the lobby where I could keep an eye on the front door and the elevators and settled in to wait. While I sat there waiting for Tricia to show I wondered at the lack of rage I was feeling. Why hadn't I waited in the room and then exploded on them when they came in. Why hadn't I sat there gleefully destroying everything that whoever the man was had left in the room? Why didn't I shred his clothes and cut up his suitcases? Why did I just look around and then leave? I honestly didn't know. I tried to think of what I might have done to drive Tricia to cheat on me, but I couldn't come up with a thing. She hadn't been any less loving or affectionate toward me. I had seen nothing that would have even remotely made me think she might be running around on me. 

About an hour later I saw Tricia coming in the front door and I recognized the man with her. Herb Scott also worked at XYZ. He was a manager in the Marketing Department. The two of them walked hand in hand to the elevator and Herb pushed the call button. The two of them kissed while they waited for the elevator to come and then the door opened and they walked inside. When the door closed I got up from where I was sitting and went to the bank of payphones and called the airline and got myself on the last flight out of Atlanta for Charlotte. I might be leaving, but was I going to let her get away with it? Not on her life, but my revenge on the cheating whore was not going to be a screaming confrontation. I wanted much more satisfaction than that. I didn't yet know what I was going to do to them, but it was going to be something that the two of them would remember for the rest of their lives. I think it was the Italians who said: 

"Revenge should be like a fine wine. It should be sipped and savored." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I landed in Charlotte and went to a bank of phones and called Tricia. When she answered the phone she sounded out of breath. 

"Where were you Rob? I called the house a couple of times and didn't get an answer." 

"Not surprising since I'm downstairs in the lobby. I'll be right up." 

"What!!" 

"Yeah lover. Charlie asked me to go to Charlotte and take care of a problem there. I had to change planes here in Atlanta and I thought I'd overnight here with you and go on to Charlotte in the morning." 

"Here? You are here in the lobby?" I could hear the panic in her voice as she said, "Hold on a second Rob; I left the water running in the bathtub and I need to turn it off." 

I heard murmuring in the background and then a very distinct "Oh shit." I smiled at the image of her lover trying to get his shit picked up and out of the room. I could imagine him scurrying down the hall to the stairwell until I was in the room, or maybe dressing there and then going down the stairs to the front desk and trying to get a room while Tricia scrambled to make the bed and think of a way to explain the wet spot. I heard a door close and then Tricia came back on the line. 

"Sorry to make you wait love, but I didn't want the tub to overflow." 

"What was that "Oh shit" I heard?" 

"In my hurry to get to the tub I stubbed my toe and it hurt." 

"Oh babe, I'm sorry." 

"It wasn't your fault." 

"Well, in a way it is. If I hadn't called to joke with you it wouldn't have happened." 

"Joke with me?" 

"Yeah sweetie, I'm not in the lobby. I'm calling from Charlotte. I did have to change planes in Atlanta and I was going to surprise you, but I couldn't get a flight out in the morning early enough to get me here for my meeting so I couldn't stop over." 

"Oh gee honey, and you had me thinking I was going to get laid tonight instead of watching the dumb stuff on TV." 

"Maybe I'll surprise you the next time. Hey, got to run. Here comes the hotel shuttle bus. I'll talk to you later sweetie. Love you." 

"I love you too Rob. Bye." 

I at least had the pleasure of knowing that I'd almost given Tricia and her asshole lover heart failure. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

During my time in Charlotte and on the trip home I thought about how I would take my revenge. I rolled a dozen plots and scenarios over in my mind and one by one I discarded them as either impractical or too hard to make happen. I got back to the main office and gave Charlie my report and as I was leaving his office I saw my revenge walking toward me. Marsha, Charlie's secretary, was just returning from the ladies room and she looked very uncomfortable waddling down the hallway. I wondered if Tricia would waddle like that and be as uncomfortable if she were eight months pregnant. 

That night, Tricia's last night on her trip, I sat down and made a list of the things I needed to do to make it happen. None of it would be too difficult, but it would be time consuming which meant that I was going to have to pretend to be the loving husband. Frankly, I wasn't sure that I was a good enough actor to pull that one off, but I had to try. 

First step in the plan would be to get Tricia pregnant even though she didn't want to be a mommy yet. Well no, that couldn't be the first step. The first step had to be getting Herb out of the picture. No, damn it, I couldn't do that either. I needed him for the confrontation if the plan was going to work. Okay, the first step had to be getting me ready and I knew just how to do that. Every summer the manager of our Dayton branch took three weeks vacation and every year Charlie asked for a volunteer to cover Dayton for the three weeks Ralph was gone. That year I was Charlie's volunteer. 

The three weeks in Dayton was just what I needed. It gave me time to settle my anger and rage, which made it easier for me to play the part of loving husband when I got home. I talked with Tricia every night and we did all the bullshit "I love you" and "I miss you" and "I wish you were here with me" garbage while all the time I was wondering if Herb was with her in our house and fucking her on our bed. 

I came home ready to implement my plan. I observed, I calculated, I charted and I planned and waited for the stars to align themselves. It took almost four more months, four months of pretending to be a loving husband, before everything fell into place. Tricia had another trip to Atlanta and I kissed her goodbye the morning she left and as soon as she was gone I picked up the phone, called Marketing and asked for Herb Scott. I was told he was in Atlanta on business and wasn't expected back for three days. 

The timing was perfect for me. I went to Charlie's office and told him I had a family emergency and was going to need a few days off and then I caught a flight to Atlanta. I lucked out and got the same desk clerk and she remembered me. After comparing my driver's license against Tricia's registration information she gave me a key card and I went on up to Tricia's room. I knocked several times and no one came to the door so I let myself in and found the same set-up I had found the last time - Herb's clothes hanging on the clothes bar next to Tricia's clothes. That was all I really wanted to make sure of so I went on down to the lobby and waited. 

I hid behind a paper and sat there until the two of them came in and got on the elevator and then I got up and went to the restaurant across the street and had my dinner. The time it took me to eat was about the amount of time I figured that it would take the two of them to get naked and be in the middle of things. I went back to the hotel, took the elevator to the fifth floor and took out my cell phone. I called the hotels number and asked for Tricia's room. Just like that last time she sounded out of breath when she picked up. 

"Oh hi honey. I was just about to call you." 

"You wouldn't have gotten me." 

"No? Why not?" 

"Remember the time I called you and jokingly told you I was in the lobby?" 

"Yes, I remember." 

"Well sweetie, this time it is no joke. I'll be right up" and I disconnected. 

It wasn't very sporting of me, in fact it was like shooting fish in a barrel. I was standing in front of room 507 when the door opened and Herb came hurrying out. He had a suitcase in each hand and all he had on was a pair of boxers. He never saw it coming as I sent my right fist into his face with all of my hundred eighty-five pounds behind it. I felt his nose break and I saw blood shoot all over the place. He hit the floor at the feet of Tricia who had been hurrying along behind him carrying his clothes. She had pulled on a robe, but hadn't tied it and it was hanging open and I saw her naked body and I saw traces of wet cum on her inner thighs. She was looking at me with an expression of horror on her face. 

"Some things never change, do they Tricia. First Danny and now Herb." 

I gave Herb two hard shots in his nuts with the toe of my shoe and then I turned and walked away. I headed for the airport and caught the last flight home. I knew Tricia well enough to know that she wasn't going to rush home from Atlanta. She would stay there and do her job so I had two more days before I would see her again and I used those two days to get ready for the next step in getting back at Herb. As far as getting even with Tricia, I wasn't yet sure how that would go down. It would depend on what she did. If she came home begging for forgiveness and really wanted it things would go the way I wanted. If not, what I had planned would still work, but wouldn't be near as satisfying. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Taking care of Herb was expensive, but if you want quality revenge you can't get it on the cheap. I knew a guy, who knew a guy, who had a friend, who knew a guy, etc., etc., and I managed to buy two pounds of marijuana and three ounces of cocaine. A Snap On tool salesman sold me a 'slim jim' and I was ready. 

Like most XYZ traveling employees, Herb left his car in the company parking lot and took the company shuttle bus to the airport. I waited until after the building had cleared out and it was dark outside and then I slipped into Herb's office and planted half a pound of grass and an ounce of coke in the back of his lower left desk drawer. Next, I used the slim jim to pop his car's door lock and I put the rest of the grass and coke under the passenger side front seat. I locked the car back up and then I went home and waited. Over the next two days I kept an eye on Herb's car and the day I saw it gone I went down the street to a pay phone and called the police. I gave them Herb's name, address and car information and told them I had seen him selling dope to the employees at XYZ and then I hung up. 

Two days later the employee cafeteria at XYZ was all-abuzz with: 

"Did you hear what happened to Herb over in Marketing? He was arrested for dealing drugs." 

"Darla over in Marketing said the police came to Herb's office with a search warrant and found drugs in his desk." 

"Joe told me Herb got stopped for some traffic violation and they found drugs in his car." 

"Fran said she heard that he pulled a gun on the cops and made a run for it." 

"I was always suspicious of that weasel. I could tell he was no good just by looking at him." 

Somehow Herb made bail and came into work only to be suspended pending an investigation into allegations that he was selling illegal substances on company property. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Meanwhile, Tricia had been calling me a half dozen times a day and I didn't take any of her calls. The day she returned she came into my office and closed the door behind her. 

"May I sit down?" 

I shrugged so she sat down on the chair on the other side of my desk. "You haven't been taking my calls." 

"Given the circumstances under which I last saw you that comes as a surprise?"  

===

"I would have thought that you would have wanted to talk." 

"What's to talk about? You replaced me." 

"That's why we need to talk Rob. I haven't replaced you. I could never replace you. I love you Rob. I know you are upset over what you saw, but Herb means nothing to me. I need you to give me a chance to explain. Can we please sit down at home tonight and talk." 

"Why? You going to try and make me believe that it never happened? That it was just some big hallucination and I really didn't see what I thought I saw?" 

"No Rob, I am going to try and convince you that I love you and that even though it did happen we can get by it." 

"Not very likely Tricia, but I'll give you a chance to talk. Now if you don't mind I'm very busy right now so please leave." 

As she got up to leave I was smiling inside. It was going to work out the way I wanted it to. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Tricia had dinner ready and a bottle of wine sitting on the counter, uncorked and 'breathing'. This was Tricia's party and I kept quiet and made her work for it. 

"First Rob, you have to know that I love you. I have always loved you and no one is ever going to take your place in my heart. I want you Rob; I don't want anyone else and you have to believe that. Herb was a mistake, a bad mistake and I should have known better after that first time." 

"Why do you say that? Why didn't you know better before the first time?" 

"Because I wasn't in any shape to know anything the first time." 

"Can you explain that so a poor simple minded soul like me can understand?" 

"The first time happened when I was drunk out of my mind. It happened on one of my office visits to Dallas. After the meetings the office staff and I went out for dinner and drinks. After dinner we went into the hotel lounge and had more drinks. You know how booze affects me Rob and you know I usually watch my drinking except when we are here at home. But I was in a hotel with a room right upstairs and I didn't have to drive home so I let myself go and enjoyed myself. By the time the people from the office left I was well on my way to being blitzed. 

"I intended going up to my room when the last of our group left, but that is when Herb came in and saw me. He was in town on business and staying at the same hotel. He sat down with me, bought me a drink and we sat and talked and he bought me another drink and then another and the next thing I knew I was on my back naked and he was doing me. I had no recollection of leaving the lounge, undressing or being undressed, just all of a sudden I'm looking up at Herb. Given what he was just arrested for, for all I know he slipped something in one of my drinks and drugged me. 

"You know me Rob and you know how I am when it comes to sex. Drunk or sober I get into it and even though I didn't know how Herb got there my body responded to what he was doing. He did me two more times and when he finished I fell asleep. In the morning when I woke up he was doing me again and when he finished he wanted my to call in and tell them I'd be late so we could do it some more and I told him to leave. 

"That night I skipped dinner and went to my room. Around nine I got hungry and called room service. When there was a knock on my door I opened it expecting it to be room service, but it was Herb. He pushed by me into the room and started undressing and as I watched I thought, "Why not?" The damage had already been done and I was curious to see what he would be like when I was sober. That was the start of it." 

"When did it start?" 

"When I got promoted and started traveling. It was on my third trip." 

"You have been fucking Herb for a year?" 

"Yes and no. It has been a year, but it has only been five or six times. Just when we find ourselves visiting an office at the same time." 

"So the other night wasn't planned in advance?" 

"No Rob, never. And I didn't go looking for him when I was on a trip, but if he came to me I never said no. That last trip he was at the airport when I got there and he talked the gate agent into seating us together. I don't have any good reason for it Rob, it was just something to do when I was away from home. Something a little better than just sitting in my room watching TV." 

"How many times did you fuck him in our house and on our bed while I was in Dayton?" 

"I never saw him except for on trips. I swear to God Rob, he was never in this house and I never did it with him except when we met on trips. If it hadn't have been for that first time it never would have happened Rob. I guess I looked at it like, "We already have, the damage is done, and Rob will never know." I don't care a bit for Herb honey, he never meant a thing to me." 

"So that makes it okay? He didn't mean anything to you?" 

"No Rob, that doesn't make it okay. I fucked up and I sitting here asking you to forgive me. I'm asking you to believe that I love you and don't want to be with anyone but you." 

"That's a tall order Tricia and I don't know that I'm the kind of man who can do it. What you did hurt me Tricia, it hurt me bad and right now I want to hurt you. I want to strike out and make you pay for what you did to me. What makes it worse is that it is the same thing you did to me with Danny. I have something inside me screaming for revenge and I can't see any way on God's green Earth that I can forgive you while I feel that way." 

"What can I do Rob? I'll do whatever you want to prove to you that I love you and want to be with you. You want to beat me? Go ahead and do it and I'll clench my teeth and take it. Go ahead Rob, take a belt to me; I'll stand still for it. I'm not kidding Rob, I WILL do whatever you want as long as we stay together." 

"What if what I want is to destroy that beautiful face of yours so that no man will ever want to look at you again. What if what I want is to carve the letter "A" for adulteress on your forehead or cheek?" 

She looked at me for several seconds and then she said, "If that is what it will take to keep us together I will accept it." 

The thing of it was that I really believe she meant it. That was the first time since the whole thing started that I gave any consideration to the fact that she might actually love me. Not that it mattered. Her love for me might have been strong, but my love for her was gone. I stood up and she asked: 

"Where are you going?" 

"I can't stay in this house with you Tricia, not the way I'm feeling right now. I'll need some time to think about what I'm going to do." 

"Please Rob, I'll do whatever I have to do, I swear I will." 

"I'll think on it Tricia and get back to you in a few days or maybe a week or so." 

She had a defeated look about her as I headed out of the house and God, but did I ever feel good about it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I let her stew about it for five days and then I called her. 

"I've decided what I'm going to do. The only way I will ever be able to live with you after what you did is if I do something to get back at you. You will have one chance and one chance only. If you do it we can start trying to put things back together. If you don't do it I'll get an attorney and start divorce proceedings." 

"What is it?" 

"All you need to know is that tomorrow I will be at the house at five-thirty and you will meet me at the door naked and you will do everything I tell you to do without complaint. Just one "Oh no, I can't do that" or an "I won't do that" and I'm gone. I'll see you at five-thirty" and I hung up on her. 

The next day I was there at five-thirty on the dot and she was waiting for me as I had specified. I handed her a bag and told her to take it into the bedroom and empty the contents on the bed. She did it and found three dozen condoms, a tube of KY Jelly and a sleep mask. 

"What's all this?" she asked. 

"It has to do with your punishment. When you told me your story of how you and Herb started you said of the second night, "I was curious what he would be like if I were sober." That told me everything Tricia. It told me that you wanted another cock. You were curious about another cock that wasn't mine and you used what had happened the night before between you and Herb as your excuse. So tonight we are going to satisfy your curiosity about other cocks. You are going to wear the sleep mask with a towel over it so that you can't see a thing and six men are going to fuck you. Six men that you know. Six men that you see at social gatherings. Six men, some of them the husbands and boyfriends of women you know and you will be blindfolded so you won't know who they are. 

"They have been told what you did and that you are a cheating whore and they are going to use you any way they want until they don't want you anymore. They are going to use your mouth, your unfaithful cunt and your ass and some of them might even want to use all three at once. That is your punishment Tricia; that is how I will get even with you. Every wedding, every funeral, every cocktail party, birthday party, Christmas party or dinner party you go to you will see men and you will look at them and wonder if any one of them was one of the men who fucked you and knew you for the filthy whore you are. Every woman you face will have you wondering, "Did I fuck your husband and if you knew would you still talk to me or would you spit in my face?" 

"Some of the men who will fuck you have a close enough relationship with their wives or girlfriends that they can tell them what happened here tonight and why. Everyone has promised absolute secrecy on this so none of them will ever let you know who they are. You will see women and wonder, "Does this woman know that I'm a whore who cheated on my husband and then gangbanged six men? Does that woman know that her husband degraded me by fucking me in my ass or had me stand in the bathtub while he pissed on me?" 

"I have no idea what the six will do to you Tricia and I don't care. They may settle for just pissing in your mouth or they may only want to gangbang your ass repeatedly, but whatever they do or want to do you will let them. One refusal on your part, however minor and I walk away. The condoms are for their use if they want your cunt, but your ass and mouth get raw cock." 

I looked at my watch. "They will be here any minute now. Your choice Tricia, either put the sleep mask on or put a robe on and cover yourself." 

She stared at me in silence and I thought I saw a tear in the corner of her right eye, but then she picked up the sleep mask and put it on. 

By three in the morning it was over. The six didn't want anymore and Tricia was a fucked out mess. She had cum all over her body and her cunt and asshole were gaping canyons. The six had treated her like a worthless whore and had called her every derogatory name in the book as they used her. Her nipples had been pinched and twisted hard, her ass had been slapped and cocks had been pushed into her mouth so hard she had gagged and choked. When the last of the six had gone I told Tricia to take off the towel and sleep mask. 

"I'm going back to the motel and check out. I want you and this room spotless when I get back and then we will see to the second part of your punishment." 

"Second part? What second part?" 

I held her birth control pills in front of her and said, "You won't be using them anymore. Get ready to be a mommy." 

"But my job? If I get pregnant I won't be able to keep working after I have the baby." 

"Other women find a way. Besides, if you are not working you won't be traveling and I won't have to wonder about what you are doing in your hotel room and with whom. Anyway, it is not debatable. We do it my way or I'm out of here. Are we clear on that?" 

There was a moment of silence and then she said, "Yes Rob." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It took me an hour to go to the motel and check out. When I got back to the house Tricia was showered and had changed the sheets on the bed and had straightened the bedroom. I made a big show of flushing her birth control pills down the toilet and then I crawled in bed with her and fucked her twice before falling asleep. 

Even though her cunt was loose and I barely felt the sides it was still a very satisfying fuck session in that I knew I had taken my revenge. How you ask? Timing, it was all in the timing. I needed Tricia to go on a trip, be with Herb and then come back at a certain time. And then I had to schedule things just right. Tricia made her trip, I did my "catch her in the act" routine and then went home and waited for her to return. I let her tell her story and then I stalled talking to her for the five days I needed to get just the right night for my revenge. If all my calculating and planning was correct the night of Tricia's gangbang was the most fertile night of her cycle. 

When the six men fucked her I made a big production out of having her roll the condoms on the men before they fucked her, but what she didn't see because of the blindfold was each man cut the end off the rubber before he fucked her and when the night was over she never saw the modified rubbers because they were flushed as soon as the man finished. I'm sure she figured out that one or two might have broken; why else would she be so sloppy, but not to worry because she was on the pill, right? Wrong!!! I had been doctoring her pills for the last two months and she wasn't protected at all. I wasn't worried about me getting her pregnant because on my three-week trip to Dayton I'd gotten a vasectomy. Any kid conceived before the gangbang would be Herb's and after the gangbang it could be anybody's. 

I made a big show of putting our marriage back together. I told Tricia that Herb and the night of revenge would never be mentioned again; that we were even and could get on with our lives. It was hard to pretend to be a husband trying to put what his wife had done behind him, forgive her and work to repair the marriage when it was the last thing on my mind. Tricia was history the day I found out about Herb and the only reason I was with her was for revenge. I'd never forgotten what she did to me with Danny. I had forgiven her for it, but I had never forgotten it. When Herb happened Danny came back to the surface and to paraphrase an old saying: 

"Fuck over me once and shame on you. Fuck over me twice and shame on me." 

There would not be a third time. 

About a month after the gangbang Tricia told me I was going to be a daddy. I of course knew that it wasn't mine and given the timing it couldn't have been Herb's so the father had to be one of the six from the gangbang, which was the plan all along. I played loving husband and happy prospective father until it was too late for Tricia to abort and then I packed my bags and moved out. I told Tricia that I was sorry, but I just could not get past her cheating on me with Herb. 

I got an apartment and then I sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity and asked for the house, the cars, the checking and savings and half of her 401k and pension. Tricia got a lawyer and in our first conference her lawyer claimed I had no proof of Tricia committing adultery. I had no private investigator reports, no film or tape and no audio. It was a case of her word against mine and she was denying it and she was counter suing and she wanted the house, the cars, the checking and savings and half of my 401k and pension plus alimony and substantial child support. 

I laughed and said I had all the proof of her infidelity that I needed in the baby she was carrying. I demanded and got a DNA test and it showed that little Sarah Anne wasn't mine. After that things moved along rather quickly. I got favorable rulings from the judge on a couple of things - he made Tricia pay my attorney's fees and all court costs, and I didn't have to pay alimony or child support, but everything else was split 50/50. We were each given the car we drove, but the house had to be sold and the proceeds split between us. 

I saw Tricia in the courtroom the day the divorce was granted. She was crying when she said to me, "How could you do this to me Rob? I loved you." 

"But not enough to stay away from Herb. If you had come to me after that first time and told me what happened we would have been okay. I could have gotten by one drugged or drunken indiscretion, but not a year's worth. Goodbye Tricia." 

It was not the last time I saw her. We both still work for XYZ and I see her maybe three times a week and when I do I ignore her.

There was one other part of my revenge and that was what I had done to Herb. He was offered a plea bargain and he, knowing full well he was innocent, turned it down and went to trial. The jury didn't believe his story that he was framed and he was found guilty and sentenced to prison. Two years into his sentence I visited him. As I sat on the other side of the glass partition with the phone in my hand I could see the curious expression on his face. I smiled at him and said: 

"Wondering why I'm here Herb? Simple. I just want the answer to a question. Have you been having a good time in here Herb? Was fucking my wife worth it?" 

I smiled at him as the realization dawned on him and I hung up the phone and got up and left. Report_Story
