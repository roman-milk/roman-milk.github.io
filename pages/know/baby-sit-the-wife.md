#1 

===

Both Nadine and her husband were getting ready to go out, looking forward to escaping from the hard work of moving home. Nadine was standing naked in what was to become their bedroom, given a chance organise it, searching for something to wear. Standing only five foot two in bare feet made it difficult to reach on top of the wardrobe. "Oh! Damn It! Why did we have to move?" Nadine shouted. 

"Because this is closer to my office and you did agree, you do like this house, don't you? Your work at your fathers place is nearly finished where mine is just starting. You know that." John complained right back at her. They were overtired and began to tease each other only there was a sharp edge to the words being thrown around. 

"That's not what I mean. It's the whole business of moving, trying to unpack. I hate it." She said through gritted teeth. It was true, her father was ill and she had almost completed settling the business for a directors' buyout, so she wouldn't have to travel to the office from now on. Her fathers' heart attack had been a shock, the whole process of selling his business had been unsettling and on top of that here they were in a new home with new neighbours to get to know, another torment to be endured. 

"You're always complaining of having nothing to wear." He shouted up the stairs. "Just get on with it, I want to get out of here for a drink." 

"I just want to get out of here, away from all this chaos. You call this packing! When was it? When did we go out last, I can't remember." 

"Oh! Not that old song. Sing something new. Change the needle or I'll leave you here." 

"You're being you're usual insensitive selfish boorish husband mode again." Nadine shouted down the stairs. 

"Oh! So, sorry! Let me give up the career and spend time with you. In poverty, it will make such a change from what you're used to. You'll love it. It's so fashionable at the moment." 

"You're being childish John." 

"I'm not the one it's you. Just get ready will you." John was impatient and knew she was pushing him but couldn't help take the bait. 

In retaliation she jumped up and down chanting in a young girlish voice she sometimes used, "I'm going out, I'm going out. Hoorah, Hoorah!" 

The sound of her voice trailed off. John hoped she had at last found something to wear. She was five years younger than him and usualy more mature but there were times when she behaved younger than her twenty five years. He was fed up of her nagging at him, yet again accusing him of not taking her out, when neither of them had time that coincided so it wasn't just his fault. When he finally has the opportunity to spend time with her she sulks, or moans with a plaintive refrain that he never spends time with her. 

"I'm ready are you?" He shouted up the stairs then walked back into the kitchen deciding to polish a pair of shoes for tomorrow. 

"John you're a complete pain, just throwing everything into boxes anyhow. I'm pulling things out and nothing matches. It's no wonder I can't find anything to wear. And, everything needs pressing. Ever heard of folding?" Nadine shouted at him from the spare room, becoming irritated thinking he was ignoring her. Coming across some old clothes in a box brings on a sudden dose of nostalgia. Pulling a dress over her head she is surprised it still fits after two years of marriage. She thought at least some weight could have been added to her figure, but alas no, she was still a sleight waif of a thing. Skipping down stairs in the old tennis dress she finds John on hands and knees rummaging in a kitchen cupboard. 

"Damn that woman she hides everything." He muttered. "I can't find the shoe polish!" He shouted, thinking she was still upstairs. Sensing her presence he looked up at her from the cupboard under the sink. 

She watched his eyes move up her legs to spy the white triangle of a pair of cotton panties. Her eye's glint with devilment as she watches the male reaction to a skimpy dress for she knows he has a thing about her legs. When he turns back to the hunt for shoe polish she decides not to forgive the muttering deciding to get back at him once more. In a petulant girly voice she taunts him, "I know where it is, but I'm not telling." Catching him blatantly looking up the skirt she asserts, "You're naughty you are." She said, sticking her tongue out at him. 

"You're the naughty one." He laughs. 

Getting some attention at last she began to run as he jumped up to chase her through the house. Catching up in the lounge he plucks her off the floor to land over his knee. With one hand he pulled down the loose white panties to smack her bottom all the while struggling to hold her still. She squirms, in delight, with both arms and legs thrashing about feigning to escape until a fit of the giggles leaves her helpless while he playfully smacked her bare bottom. 

"Now, are you going to behave like a good young lady and do as you are told?" He asked. 

Not daring to look at him in case the fit of giggling bursts forth again she hangs her head low looking at her bare feet, replying mischievously. "Yes sir, I promise to do as I am told." 

He tries to speak firmly without laughing. "Good. I am glad. Otherwise I will have to spank you again." 

She was about to tell him he should spank her right now because she was sure to be naughty later on; after a few drinks at a club. The doorbell rang bringing a halt to the impish mood. Her bottom smarted a little but she marvelled at how the rest of her body tingled at being chased then chastened. It was surprisingly stimulating. 

They hadn't made time for playing around like this in a long time for they had both worked hard, his new business venture, and her fathers company. Perhaps this new home would renew their relationship. She smiled happily, hoping this unexpected gesture of assertiveness might continue for she enjoyed being dominated by him, as it allowed her to feel free to misbehave. 

She hadn't followed what was going on at the front door but recognised their new neighbours grating voice. 

"I was just going out." He said, in a loud voice warning her that the woman wasn't being put off. 

"It won't take a minute love. Hello dear, how are you?" The woman said as she barged through into the lounge. "I just want a quick look at your fire place." She said. 

Nadine hit her husband with a menacing glare, sweeping both hands across the little dress, mouthing the words, "How dare you let her in." Nadine looked at the woman with scorn as she measured the fireplace with both arms stretched out. She saw a woman made up like a tart, with heavy make-up; ready for a night out at a disco, in contrast to the rather dowdy neighbour they had talked to when moving in. Noticing her panties on the floor distracted Nadine from making further hand signals, meaning for him to get rid of the woman. She deftly picked them up with a toe. 

The woman turned to her husband to ask. "Could you put a light on? How much do you want for it then?" 

Watching his wife trying to kick her panties across the room out of the way was distracting but he did vaguely remember mentioning they wanted to get rid of the hideous thing. He absently replied. "We're putting in a new light fitting so they don't work. I haven't thought about a price, come back tomorrow you can talk to the wife then." Nadine flicked her ankle but the panties wrapped themselves around a foot. She kicked out several times until they flew across the room catching on the back of the neighbour's dress. 

The woman turned to Nadine, who hid her face behind long hair staring down at the carpet not wanting to be recognised in the childish looking outfit. With a soft complexion and slim figure she looked too young to be a married woman and this time was happy to take advantage of being mistaking for a teenager. "Oh! What pretty hair your daughter has." The woman said while stroking Nadine's long hair. 

"My wife's younger sister." He offered in way of explanation. He hesitated a moment, trying hard to think on the spur of the moment, then continued with the deceit. "Leonora. Say hello Leo. Oh, what is your name by the way?" He discreetly pulled his wife's panties from the woman's dress and scrunched them into a ball, hastily stuffing them into a pocket. 

The woman felt his hand, thinking he was touching her up. She turned on him, and with a big smile said. "Barbara, but you can call me Babe. So, where are you going out tonight, John?" 

"I don't know the area yet so it could be anywhere, somewhere there's a bit of life." He replied vaguely. "I'm waiting for my wife to turn up with a baby sitter for Leo." He added, trying to put the woman's obvious flirtation off track by mentioning his wife. 

"Well I know all the right places to go. I can show you around." Barbara said smiling at him, pouting with what she thought was feminine charm. 

Seeing her husband in some difficulty she spontaneously upped the stakes to their little game, telling him. "You go ahead uncle, I will be alright here until Aunty returns." She said, purposely putting him on the spot. She was enjoying the stupid man's discomfort enormously, thinking it deserved him right for letting this woman in while she was so improperly dressed. 

The doorbell rang so he escaped to the front door with an excuse not to reply. Like the woman herself her daughter rudely barged in. "I'm glad I caught you, I need a key. It's gone nine and you're going to be late you know." Gloria said to her mother, without saying hello or even acknowledging either John or Nadine's presence. 

The young woman only ninteen alrady looked even more of a tart than the mother. A tee shirt was tied under large breasts pushing them up under her chin. She flicked short hair around in annoyance. The expression left her looking as though she was sucking a lemon. How this obnoxious family could afford to live in such an exclusive neighbourhood Nadine couldn't imagine and why did they have the misfortune to live next door to them. 

"Well that's lucky. You can stay here until John's wife turns up. You John, can give me a lift into town." The woman ordered John. 

"Well I guess I can give you a lift." He said, looking meaningfully at his wife expecting her to rally with some excuse for him to stay. 

"Off you go. Enjoy yourself, Uncle." She said. 

John glared at her. "You behave yourself. You promised earlier. Remember? Do as your told." Looking at Gloria he told her, "Don't let her out of your sight or she'll make trouble. She's been misbehaving all day. I promised to put her over my knee if she misbehaved again." John told the baby sitter. 

Taking his arm, steering him out, Barbara said over her shoulder, "We'll be in the Black Cat." Cackling like an old crone, with a smokers rasp, the woman pulled him through the door and away into the night. 

John felt uneasy leaving his wife knowing he'd be in trouble on returning home but he figured on dumping Babe at the club to quickly return to the rescue. Besides, she would be safe enough at home. It would teach her a lesson not to play around like that. 

*** 

Taking a firm grip of his arm she led him onto the club. "You'll have to let me buy you a drink in return for the ride." Barbara cooed. "I'll look after you until your wife turns up and you can look after me until my friends arrive. OK?" She told him while ordering the drinks, not waiting for a reply. 

Once manoeuvred into the club it didn't seem such a bad idea, prolonging his wife's embarrassment for a while might make her glad of his return. 

*** 

Nadine was stunned. This couth young woman was staring at her fiercely obviously put out that she had been stuck with baby-sitting and looked a tuff prospect not easily handled even though Nadine was an older woman. Nadine had experience of these bullying types at school and was a little afraid of her. Carefully forming the words to dismiss her, intending to tell her she would be all right alone, the doorbell rang yet again. Nadine was relieved, wondering at how quickly he had got rid of that persistent woman; perhaps he had shown some determination for once and told her to get a taxi. 

Gloria walked back into the lounge with a tall athletic young man. Nadine couldn't help looking him up and down for he was a muscular hunk designed to send a shiver through any woman's body. His tight jeans revealed a tight bum and with the cut off tee shirt he looked as though he had arrived off a building site calendar. She hadn't realised she was staring. 

"Hey! This is my boyfriend, Daren. Tell mum he's been here and you're in trouble. Got it?" Gloria threatened. 

Nadine nodded, lowering her head to hide the embarrassment of being told off by this young woman as well as being caught ogling her young man. She screwed herself up in the far corner of the sofa out of the way. Pulling both legs up was a reminder her panties were in John's pocket leaving her desperately pulling at the hem of the dress until a nipple nearly popped over the top. Sinking back deeper into the sofa so as not to be noticed she felt as uncomfortable and awkward as the gawky teenager she had been a few years back, hoping not to be noticed by older kids. 

"How did you know I was here?" Gloria asked him. 

"Your brother." He said as he plonked his body between them on the sofa. 

Uncomfortable at having the hunk so close she sat as unobtrusively as possible trying to keep the dress down, desperate not to reveal a humiliating nakedness. She was going to have to escape upstairs and rummage around for something more suitable to wear. Inwardly she groaned realising she couldn't wear anything that might reveal her true age for they would guess she was the woman of the house, the wife, not his niece. 

Being short with a slight build and thin legs, left most people with the impression she was a young teenager. With a baby face complexion she was used to carrying Id to prove she was over twenty-one, but this was going too far. At least it was getting darker and with just taped wires sticking out from the walls there was no danger of them being enlightened, she felt safer in the gloom. 

"The little bugger. I'll paste him when I see him. He could have let me in. I wouldn't be here baby-sitting then. I'm in no mood to baby sit tonight. You just sit there and keep quiet." Gloria said, pointing a bright red fingernail at Nadine. 

"So what are you in the mood for?" Daren asked. He slid an arm around her pulling tight, with Gloria relenting a little, enjoying the caresses upon an upturned neck, until he started getting carried away. 

"I'll go upstairs and play." Nadine said. Feeling awkward at their brash display she though it an opportune moment to escape out of the way. 

"No. I want you where I can see you." Gloria told her. Straightening the tight short skirt she elbowed Daren off her body. 

"Come on let her go. She's in the way here." Daren tried to persuade her. "Besides she might tell your mum about you and me." 

"No way. You tell and you're for it. Like your uncle said you'll get your bottom spanked. Got it?" Gloria threatened. 

He took the change in mood as a hint that he wasn't going to get anything from Gloria this evening. Scowling, looking peeved he turned to Nadine and said. "No trouble or I'll put you over my knee." 

Gloria chuckled revealing she smoked like her mother. 

Nadine lowered her head and screwed her body up protectively on the very end of the sofa. The thought of these two young people roughing her up was frightening, with the prospect of them finding out she was the wife it was so very upsetting. She would have to play along with them. It had gone too far to back out now. If neighbours found out from these two, perhaps through the mother, she would be a laughing stock. 

They sat quiet for a moment then his face brightened. "Look, I've got this new phone with a camera, video, email, music, it's go the lot." He said. Fiddling with the thing he became happily occupied. 

Gloria sat fuming wanting his attention. 

Nadine closed her eyes wondering how she had fallen into this ridiculous situation. If it was revealed she was John's wife a tale would go around the neighbours growing more farcical in the telling, making it too embarrassing to face them. She resigned herself to the torment, waiting upon John's return for rescue and surely it wouldn't take him much longer. They could laugh this silly situation off, even salvaging the rest of the evening, if he hurried back. She'd have to make sure of dressing over her age and wear lots of make-up for a few weeks in case anyone recognised her. She would tell that awful neighbour her niece had returned home. 

"Put that thing down." Gloria said. He pointed the camera at her and snapped a picture. "Give it here." She told him. Hiding it behind her she let him scrabble for it giggling with pleasure. In his grasp she let him pet her not stopping him when he pushed a hand under her bottom pretending to look for the hidden toy. 

He stopped a moment to plead, "Send her off to bed Gloria." Nadine unwound herself reaching for the floor with bare feet poised in motion by Gloria's strident tones. 

"Not so fast you." Gloria said. "It's no good she'll spill all when her uncle gets home. Then my mum will find out. What if her aunt arrives finding us on the sofa?" 

"I won't. I promise. Anyway in the morning they'll pack me off home." Nadine protested. 

"So. You'll be safely home tomorrow. So what's to stop you telling before you leave? Over breakfast you'll be full of it. I'm in trouble already." Gloria glared, rolling her eyes in disgust. Taking hold of Nadine's hair she pulled the frightened woman close, with a threat forming upon her lips. The harridan was stopped before she could utter another threat. 

"Let go you bitch." Nadine shouted, having had just enough of this course girl. She was much younger and worlds apart judging by friends and family. 

Gloria took a firmer grip of the struggling woman's hair, exclaiming. "Call me a bitch will you!" They fell off the sofa into a thrashing turmoil of limbs on the floor. Words were incomprehensible as both women gave vent to their own stored up frustrations. Nadine's dress was warped round her waist; Gloria's top was torn with the skirt twisted up around her hips. Gloria soon got the better of her foe being used to struggling with boys and before that with two younger brothers in sibling rivalry. 

Gloria pulled the thrashing woman off the floor onto the sofa where Nadine ended up sprawled over Daren's knees. With one hand Gloria pulled at her clothes with the other still gripping Nadine's arm, not noticing the woman's bare arse, she told Daren. "You weren't much help. Now spank the bitch. Teach her not to talk to me like that." 

Daren looked at the naked bottom wriggling across his knees not knowing what to do. With one hand protecting the phone he tentatively slapped her bottom. She reacted by kicking out pitching the camera onto the sofa. "Bitch!" He exclaimed, and slapped her wriggling bottom hard. 

She stopped moving, stunned at the pain. With each stroke of his hand she whimpered out of breathe little sounds of anguish. He pushed her out of the way onto the floor to retrieve the precious phone. 

"Get up bitch. So you have something to tell them now." Gloria spat. "What do you call me now, bitch. Apologise!" Nadine stood desperately pulling at the hem of the dress, her head spinning with fear not wanting to try the girls anger, not knowing what to do or say. 

"Sorry!" She murmured. 

"What do you call me now." Gloria taunted. 

"Sorry, miss." She said, dredging up memories from boarding school days. 

"What do you say to him?" 

"Sorry, Sir." 

"She might have broken my new phone." Daren huffed. 

Gloria cleared hair away from her face tucking it behind an ear wanting to a get a better look at the victim. Again Nadine buried her face in long hair, looking down at her feet in disgrace. Her hands were behind her back holding down the hem of the little dress wanting to rub her smarting backside, only just resisting.  

===

"I'll have to do something about this top before I go home. I know what my brothers will think I've been up to if they see it torn and what they will say to mum. When's this aunt of yours getting back?" 

Nadine was silent standing bowed before them trying to come to terms with the shame of being stretched bare assed over this young mans lap. The humiliation of being spanked by a stranger was awful. 

Returning from primping her hair in the bathroom Gloria said. "Here use this. It'll take the redness away." To Daren she said. "She's bound to tell so lets get rid of some evidence, that cream should sooth the redness away. I'm going upstairs to find a top before the wife gets back, I just hope she's got something fash." Gloria said, flinging a tube of ointment onto the sofa. Over her shoulder she complained. "Stop playing with that damn phone." 

Unaware of the young woman returning to the room or what was said, Nadine simply stood where she was in shock unaware of the feelings resurrected from when her husband had playfully spanked her. This was different; this had been a thoughtless spur of the moment punishment by a complete stranger and it left her feeling submissive as well as a little turned on. 

"Well?" he said. When she didn't move he grabbed an arm pulling her onto the sofa. Darent over a cushion he looked at the glowing red cheeks knowing it would be him in trouble with perhaps an assault charge once she told someone about it. Wondering if he could blame Gloria, nothing came to mind, so it would be crucial to do something. 

Pushing the tube into her hand she made no move leaving him feeling more annoyed. Pulling the tube of ointment from her fingers he squeezed some over both cheeks to start her off on the task. Still she made no move. Hesitantly squishing the ointment over both cheeks he found it was like too much sun cream where the white grease just wasn't sinking in to the flesh. In ever widening circles the tips of his fingers gingerly massaged her bottom until he started trying to smooth it in with both hands sliding over both cheeks. Becoming bolder from a lack of reaction his hands slipped between her thighs. 

With growing daring his fingers rose up her thighs until the tips circled her sex. Never having seen a woman from this angle he was mesmerised by the swelling of twin lips exposing more of the female mystery. Dipping in with a fingertip he happened to touch her swollen bud eliciting a moan. He circled it again drawing out a stronger response from somewhere deep in her throat. Pushing on it he wondered if this was the sex button friends' had been talking about. Moving his hands back to her cheeks he was astonished to feel her lift up in search of a finger. He slid a greased finger back in to see what would happen. Surprised at feeling her gyrate her hips upon a finger he sat in awe mesmerised by the wonton display. 

When Gloria called from an upstairs bedroom he recoiled, almost rising from the seat, pushing her whole body upward. At the same time his hand inadvertently pushed heavily down upon her sex with two fingers burrowing deep. She writhed as though in pain, squeaking a little bird like noise. In fear he drew his fingers away from her. As though it were an open mouthed chick demanding a worm it rose up at him. With both hands he massaged her bottom, between her thighs and up to her sex. With an intense squeak of obvious pleasure she relaxed over his lap, limp. He rolled her off his lap onto the sofa, pulled her dress down and wondered if he had just made everything so much worse. 

Nadine had been so completely overwhelmed she was unaware of where she was until feeling a pair of strong hands massaging her bottom. The gentle motion was soothing the sting and more. Giving in to the sensuous pleasure was wrong but she still couldn't think straight and though she wanted it to stop she just couldn't summon the strength to move. All thought evaporated as she submitted to the deep feeling coursing through her body until her whole being was reduced to one point, one touch. A sensation exploded outward from that place, rattling every nerve. The orgasm was all consuming leaving her a heap of sensitive flesh rolled into a tight ball on the sofa where she hugged her legs to her body. 

Returning from washing his hands he saw Nadine was curled up on the sofa presumably asleep. Gloria walked in picked up the tube, screwed on the top and tossed it under the sofa. "Lets go. I'm not waiting for anyone to get back. We'll face the trouble tomorrow."  

===

Nadine waited for her husband to clear the house before rising unable to face him or anyone else. Fortunately he slept in the spare room too cautious to wake her and slunk out early this morning for a round of golf. 

She was lingering over a cup of coffee wondering if it would be wiser to give him a hard time over being left with the neighbours daughter or keep silent, as she would rather forget the whole sordid episode, but he would expect her to say something. Again she thought silence might just work or was it wishful thinking for she didn't trust herself to be able to carry on a convincing argument when she felt so guilty. 

There was a knock at the back door. "Come in its open." She shouted. "Damn!" She thought he's forgotten something. She felt safer with her back to the door so he wouldn't see the guilty expression still writ large upon her face and she still needed more time alone to get her thoughts back together after last night's ordeal. 

"Hello Mrs Brandon. How are you this morning?" 

"Shit!" She thought. The coffee cup rattled the table as it almost fell from her grip. The unmistakable voice of the baby sitters boyfriend shook what little stability had been pulled together. 

"I'm not so good. Can you come back later?" She said, not daring to turn to face him, she just sat staring down into the black coffee. 

"I've got this for you." He said. 

Not caring what it was she murmured. "Just put it on the table. I'll look at it later." He pushed the phone along the table, in her face, forcing her to look at the tiny screen. Her eyes focused to see a picture of a naked body, her body on the sofa taken last night. It began to move. 

"I hadn't realised the movie camera was on. Well, not at first. I edited it on my computer last night. I took out all the useless shots of the carpet and sofa, even the ceiling." He said quietly. "This bit is when it was kicked out of my hand. It landed on the sofa so it wasn't broken after all." He said calmly. 

On the small screen it could just be made out, a close up of a hand slapping a bottom. If she hadn't been there perhaps it would be unrecognisable for what it was. Stunned, she sat attempting to digest this new twist of a knife in her stomach. 

"Open your eyes Mrs Brandon." He said politely. 

She looked up to see the young nineteen year old standing by the kitchen television with a wire running to his mobile phone. She didn't understand what was going on. There she was on the big screen. Trying to deny what was going on her thoughts drifted off. 'Why had they such a large screen in the kitchen.' She wondered, trying not to look at it. 'They never used it. Breakfast was always a hurried affair and in the evening they dined in the lounge.' Then she remembered it was a fixture, it came with the house. Unable to move her head, her eyes wide, the brain began catching up with events. 

Mrs Brandon heard clearly a voice, her voice, out of view calling the babysitter a bitch. The scene showed two women on the floor squabbling in a writhing heap. The large screen showed her face clearly, other things too clearly. Now the view was straight between her legs, her bottom shaking with each slap. 

"That's when it fell on the sofa." He said. 

The scene changed again. A very nervous looking young woman was pulling at a little white dress standing mumbling, apologising. Another clear shot of her face looking contrite, where she was obviously feeling very sorry for herself. 

Over his knees again only a different angle this time. Watching her bottom being massaged brought back the sensuous feelings, which she desperately tried to ignore. Her head looked round into view, revealing a look of bliss as she arched her back. The face dropped out of view to reveal a close up of her crotch with fingers delving intimately. She gasped on seeing her hips rise up clearly striving to regain contact with those nimble fingers. Watching in shocked fascination, not remembering anything of these final moments of orgasm, she marvelled at its intensity. She sat in stunned silence looking at the blank screen. 

Mrs Brandon rocked on the kitchen stool nearly falling in a feint. "Here let me help you. You need to sit down. Over here." Daren said, calmly trying to reassure her. He guided her into the lounge to sit on the very same sinful sofa, where she folded weakly onto his knees. He pulled the dressing gown to one side. 

"No! I mustn't. I'm a married woman. You mustn't do that. Please. Oh!" Her voice trailed off to nothing. Once more fingers worked magically upon her body only this time with more confidence. "Please stop. This is wrong." She repeated, making no attempt to stop him. The same ointment had been found under the sofa for two hands to lavishly spread the grease over her upturned bottom. His fingers polished the glistening softness working their magic upon over- wrought senses. "Oh. No! You mustn't. Please!" She gasped. "Yes!" 

Two fingers probed finding different places to explore. A steady rhythm of fingers and thumb worked hard, a little more expertly than the night before. She writhed and squirmed desperately thrusting her crotch up at those tormenting digits grasping his fingers inside to heighten the exquisite sensations. "Yes! I'm coming!" She screeched. 

He slipped the supine body gently to the floor then lifted her head cupping her face in his wet hands forcing her to look him in the eye. "What do you say, Mrs Brandon." He asked. 

Falling back into the role she had played last night it was easy to reply. "Thank you, Sir." 

He guided her head into his lap for something else he had heard about but never experienced. Intently watching a tongue tentatively flick against the head of his cock held him captive as completely as she had been ensnared. Watching a pair of luscious lips cautiously suck the head between them and the feeling of her tongue playing against sensitive skin was too much to bear. He pulled her head forward burying himself in her face. 

Choking, retching and protesting, it made no difference, for he was beyond caring. He fell back into the sofa pulling her head forcefully, burying his cock deep into her throat. 

*** 

Mr Brandon complimented Daren on a job well done. "You handled that like an expert. I couldn't have done a better job myself." He said, while his wife stood quietly not knowing what to say, too self-conscious to join in. "What do you think, darling? Has he got the magic touch or not." John asked his wife. 

"He certainly knows what he is doing." Nadine agreed. 

"Now you're taking over that tedious task Nadine won't be nagging me and I have more time to play golf." He laughed. "That bush of hers looks superb, I've never seen it looking so alive. You have a gift for gardening." He said, while hefting a golf bag over his shoulder. 

"Thank you, Mr Brandon. That hedge trimmer is a brilliant piece of equipment. It takes half the time compared to the old one." 

Mrs Brandon thought about men and their toys but made no comment, simply handing their new gardener a glass of juice. 

"Thank you, Mrs Brandon. It certainly gave me a thirst hefting that trimmer around." Daren said. 

She almost replied, "Thank you, Sir." As he handed back the glass, but caught the 'Sir' in time. 

As her husband drove off she knew the moment had arrived for a change of roles, as she had done so often over the past two weeks, from housewife to sex toy. Daren would be stepping into the kitchen from the garden at any moment, to take control of another of his new toys. She wondered if he had brought another accessory, for as his plaything she had an intense concern over what new attachment she might be wearing. 

She was wearing one at the moment. She wriggled her bottom; clenching both cheeks as a reminder that she had been reduced to a mere toy fitted with accessories by an attentive owner. Resigned to playing along with whatever took his fancy she hoped it wouldn't be painful. 

*** 

Two weeks ago, while on her knees before him, he had explained as delicately as he could this would be her position from now on. She remembered protesting. "No! This mustn't happen again. It's wrong. You're a young man. You must find yourself a young girlfriend." She desperately fought for words and excuses until he pulled her over his knee and spanked her bottom where she once more sunk into a submissive role. Attempting to assuage the guilt she told herself there was no choice it would have to be endured, whatever he wanted, while that damning video existed. 

When he arrived a third time she was desperate for its return. "Please Daren. Give me the video. This has got to stop. No more. Please, Daren. I mean it this time. Brag to whom you like but this has got to stop. Now. No more." 

"Get down on your knees if you want to beg. That's it. You're like a bitch on heat. Admit it. Say it, Mrs Brandon." 

"I'm a bitch on heat." She quavered; the excuse she made to herself was this might be the only way to get it back. Whatever it took, however humiliating, she would grovel for this dreadful secret to be kept, she would have to beg this young man for her life back. 

"You're a bitch waiting for me to make you come. You want me to play with you. Tell me, Mrs Brandon." He commanded her. 

"I want you to play with me." Her voice faltered with shame knowing it was true, she did want to feel those strong fingers playing with her. 

"You're my toy to play with. Say it Mrs Brandon." He goaded her. 

"I'm your toy to play with." She moaned. He took a hold of her long hair pulling her face close to his saying clearly and slowly. "You are my toy Mrs Brandon. I'm here to play with you, to do what ever I like with you." 

For two weeks she pandered to his whims, each time giving in to whatever he wanted. So here she was a sex toy waiting for him to play with, bent and shaped to his whims for whenever and however he wanted her. What she hadn't thought through was how much more he had over her after fulfilling each sordid act, so it seemed she was his toy until discarded. She tried not to think about being unwanted knowing it was wrong not to look forward to that day of freedom. 

*** 

Nadine stood in her own kitchen with head bowed as he walked in not wanting to reveal the look of anticipation upon her face, not wanting him to know she had become somehow dependent upon these sordid sex sessions. She felt him reach between her legs pulling gently at the butt plug. 

"Just checking." He said, in response to a startled reaction. 

She could have taken it out until he arrived but somehow there was a compulsion to obey, even when he wasn't there in the house. Each day it was removed while spread over his lap then replaced before he left. What would have happened if she had to use the toilet before he arrived? It would be just so humiliating to phone this young man for permission to visit the bathroom. 

"Bend over." He said. Bent over displaying everything she felt disgraced having this young man delving between her legs and in her own kitchen too. Having removed it he told her, "You don't have to wear it again. Go and freshen up. I'll wait for you in the lounge." 

Had it been there just as a reminder of her lowly position, to humiliate, or a test of obedience? Surely he knew by now how completely hooked on this grubby game she had become. Standing before him in a short plaid skirt she wondered what was to be her fate today. A slight tap of his hand upon his knee was the signal for her to lie there stretched out where he started as always with the delicious massage of oil over her bottom that she delighted in so much. Just a small comfortable release was felt, but it didn't matter, for she was sure to experience a dramatic climax before he left. 

"Stand up. Now bend over that chair." He said, while guiding her by the hips to a large easy chair. From behind he pulled open the white blouse finding her small nipples already hard, rubbing, pinching, teasing them, forcing from her lips involuntary little gasps of pleasure. His cock sawed across her wet lips teasing there too. 

She felt him pushing at her crotch only it didn't feel right so she stuck her bottom out trying to couple with him. Each time, before she could push back onto him he slipped away, either from the slickness of the oil or from her own wet juices. In frustration she was trying harder, thrusting back, needing to feel him inside. Unexpectedly he entered or had she pushed onto him, only it felt wrong. Sobering up from the sexual headiness that had fogged her mind, the wrongness of it suddenly made sense. Pulling away was impossible as he had her pressed hard up against the chair. 

"No!" She managed to gasp. "Please. Not that! Not there. Oh!" She wailed. Feeling the hardness slowly slide up her rear was a shock but she didn't cry out in pain rather she whimpered at the degradation of her virgin bottom being taken. On feeling him tense and a final thrust she screeched loudly, "No! Not that! Please no!" She cried out as he came in spurts that seemed to last an age, feeling each moment with intense disgrace. 

It hadn't been a pleasure it had been endured. Mrs Brandon lay slumped across an easy chair with the little plaid skirt up around her waist, panties around her knees, shamefully naked before this young man. He was no longer a stranger; he knew all of her secrets and now all of her personal places. With monumental effort she pulled herself together from an overwhelming lethargy. 'So that was why I was wearing the butt plug.' She thought. 'I'm so stupid not to have realised what he was up to.' Attempting to assuage the intense feelings of guilt over giving up this last fragment of dignity she told herself there was no choice but give in however crushing the ordeal. 

*** 

A few days had passed without molestation from the tormentor leaving some time to think and regain strength of purpose. She had enough self knowledge to realise it had gone this far from a base need he was satisfying but how low would she fall, how far was she willing to go? It wouldn't be long before she was discovered and her whole world fell apart so an escape plan was formed. Nadine concentrated all her efforts using the same business techniques utilised when selling her fathers business. At last she was ready for him. 

Her hand was shaking as she waited for him to answer the phone. "Daren. It's me. We can't meet here, can I come over there?" Her words spilled out in a single gush of breath. "It's too dangerous, we'll be found out. OK. I mean I'll be found out. Just not here, please. When do you want me? Whatever you want. Yes. I will. I'll be there." She put down the phone and took a deep breath. If she had a hat she would have set it at a jaunty angle. 

*** 

Arriving in the area she was unsure if she wanted to even get out of the car for the apartment was in a seedy area of town, the street looking dark and forbidding. The streetlights were out and the old brick buildings had been left to rot. Looking round she worried if the car would be there when she returned. 

The boarded up door opened upon a shabby corridor. She followed him up a flight of creaky uncarpeted stairs gripping the coat tight to her body not wanting to touch the mouldy peeling walls. At the top of the stairs another boarded up door was opened onto a dark forbidding room that she dare not examine too closely. In the gloom she noticed the glow of a computer screen. Her eyes brightened on seeing the object of her salvation and quickly dropped her head in case he saw the look of interest. 

"Here let me take your coat." Daren told her. 

As ordered she wore her hair pinned up showing off a long sensuous neck. The white bra pushed her small breasts up into as much of a cleavage that could be managed, where usually she wore something padded this was thin and lacy. The matching panties were a filmy transparent white lace together with a suspender belt, the whole raunchy set bought as instructed. The stockings too were sheer seamed white nylon stretched tight by thin belts pressing at her milky white thighs. Even with the high heels she was still only as tall as his broad shoulders. 

Winding both arms about her body was an unconscious movement not from cold, more as a token protection of a near naked body. 

"Hear let me take you on a tour of the place." He said, taking a thin delicate hand engulfing it in a large paw. "I've been working and didn't notice it getting dark." 

With the sudden brightness she became more conscious of the lascivious outfit she was displaying her body in. It seemed so sordid in this young man's home. Trotting around with him she saw the apartment was unexpectedly well decorated. The whole floor of the warehouse had been refurbished, though not completely decorated it was impressive. 

"Here's my pride and joy. My other toy." He laughed loudly. 

Trying not to show too much interest she wondered if she could distract him long enough to find the photos and video of that fateful night. Even if she had to break in she would find and destroy the evidence of her downfall. Without proof who would believe him?  

===

"You look gorgeous in white." Daren told her. Nadine looked away from the young man embarrassed at being reminded how she was undressed. "Just stand there and let me take you all in." He sat on a low sofa looking up at her while she stood awkwardly, embarrassed, fingers twitching. She was finding it difficult to know what to do with her hands not wanting to touch bare flesh or the lacy underwear. The bra was comfortable and it made the most of small breasts. The panties were high cut over the hips with a suspender belt biting beneath them. The thin straps holding the sheer stockings wrapping tight her legs clung into hollow thighs. 

It was difficult to decide if the rear view was better than the front. The white silk pursed generous lips outlining them delicately. The suspender belt framed a tight round bottom and with a slight forward bend a glimpse of the silk clad lips was delightful. 

"Well! Mrs Brandon. What brings you here on a rainy Saturday morning?" He asked. 

She hated it when he called her that, a reminder she was a mature married woman, yet this young man had her trapped. He was using a video showing them both in a sordid romp as blackmail. He had her obeying his whims until he decided to destroy the evidence. It was either obey him or have her little comfortable world destroyed. Several times she had decided to defy him only to back down at the last minute. Every time they met she committed ever more sordid acts that strengthened his hold over her. 

"You did." She said in resignation. "As you ordered I am here, wearing this." 

"What are you here for?" He asked. 

Looking away from the computer she wondered if there would be a chance to delete that video. It was no longer on his phone so it must be there and that was the main reason she was here. Or was it? It seemed as though there was little resistance left to his demands yet she had to try, even if it meant pretending she could refuse to accept what he wanted. 

"To serve you, sir." She meekly replied. The word 'sir' left her lips unconsciously for she had succumbed to his dominance with little dignity left. 

"Get down on your hands and knees. Crawl over here. Rest your head in my lap." He stroked the long hair reaching with one hand to grasp a breast, found a nipple, and squeezed it. She let out a little gasp in surprise. 

She could feel his hardness against her cheek, smelling it, wanting it. The shameful thoughts were tormenting, overpowering, until she succumbed to his touch once again. 

"What do you want?" He asked gently breathing in an upturned ear. 

"You. I want you." She breathed. 

"Say what you want me to do to you." He demanded. She didn't want to say anything just wanting to get on with it. "I want you in me." She whimpered. 

"I know what you want me to do, just tell me." 

"I want you to spank me." She pleaded. She gasped on hearing the beseeching tone, the words, feeling the need, it was shocking. 

She felt him lift her off the floor over his lap and pull her panties down. The first slap was light yet it was still a jolt. With long pauses between, several smacks stung her cheeks. He was taking his time prolonging the shame. It wasn't the punishment she wanted it was what followed. It was over. She felt cold grease smoothed over her heated bottom and between simmering cheeks. She squirmed knowing what was to come. It would be her that came and it would be wonderful. 

His palm was circling over her bottom bringing a frantic need for a touch of those expert fingertips. At last the magical touch, his fingers made contact and her legs parted no longer under control they spread wide. Those strong hands pressed down, with a finger entering her sex immediately finding the on button. She tried to push her bottom up onto them but he held her in place. He teased; holding back from entering then lightly circled her anus. 

She felt fingers flitting between her labia and her anus, pressing, probing and teasing. A thumb spread her open with a finger entering her bottom deeply. The thumb rubbed her clit then his other hand engulfed her pussy with two fingers entered and explored. He knew her body so well now the fireworks quickly sparked and roared. From inside, down her legs, over her tummy, the quivering climaxed to a quacking orgasm. 

Once more kneeling on the floor with head in his lap, not conscious of sliding there, she lifted her head to nuzzle his. Rubbing her face over the head of his cock she kept back from swallowing it wanting to worship it. 

He watched her playing with him again amazed on seeing her open wide to slip her mouth over the end of his penis. With eyes wide open the sight of her sucking it was mind numbingly exotic. Her head purposefully moved forward until with one determined stroke her upper lip kissed his pelvis with the lower lip kissing his balls. A faster stroke backward then again a slow determined downward kiss sucked his entire penis down her throat. With eyes shut tight all he could sense was the feeling of being tight inside of her throat. Nothing else existed. 

Wanting to hold on, to prolong the ecstasy, there was no hope at all, the juddering climax leapt upon him taking over. It seemed as though he were coming a gallon until at last he lay limp, satisfied, sucked dry. 

He opened his eyes with her coming into focus, mouth open to display his load. He smiled and nodded. She swallowed. He lay back once more while she cleaned him up, licking, sucking, and slurping on his wet flaccid member. 

"What do you say now?" He asked. 

"Thank you, sir." She sighed. 

"You're a sex doll, my sex doll aren't you." He told her. 

At that moment she was bereft of argument. She had asked for it and he had delivered. It was still a surprise that she wanted a spanking let alone asking him for it. She told herself it was what followed that triggered the request; it was the expectation of a wonderful orgasm that brought her so low. 

"Yes, Sir." She answered reluctantly. There was sure to be more humiliation to come but felt there was little to do but suffer it. It was so frustrating knowing the photos and video were so close on that computer yet so out of reach. Once they were destroyed she would be free. 

The door swung open and a young woman sauntered in. "What are you doing here?" Daren sneered at the intruder. 

"I'm getting some of my stuff. Didn't think you'd be here. So who's this then, my replacement?" She asked casually. 

"Go make a coffee." Daren told Nadine. She had been fearfully standing with head down hiding her face in long hair not wanting to be recognised. Not wanting anyone to know of her disgrace let alone this young woman of all people. Her neighbour's daughter was a tramp and her mother a gossip. In an instant Nadine turned on a heel to disappear to the kitchen, glad to obey. 

"Gloria you had better give me the key." Daren demanded holding a hand out to her. 

"Sure. No problem. I just need to get some of my stuff and I'll be gone." She countered. 

"Do I get a coffee?" She teased. Nadine dare not return to the living space but how long could she fuss about in the kitchen area, wishing it were a separate room just to close the door on the bitch. She still only wore the underwear she had been summoned in. Tidying up she contrived to stay out of the way until the young woman left. 

"Look, are you in a hurry?" He asked. 

"Don't worry I'm not hanging around, even for a drink." Gloria flashed back at him while ferreting around among the music collection stacked along one wall. 

"You could do me a favour, for old times sake. Look after her for me till I get back, I won't be long. Some business." He explained. 

"You want me to baby sit your latest girl friend? Oh! I remember her, the niece. Well! That's funny!" She laughed. "Why can't you leave her here?" Gloria was curious wondering what he was up to. 

"I can't take her with me and I don't want to leave her here by herself. Don't ask, just do me a favour, you owe me." 

Nadine heard them murmuring, not wanting to know what they were talking about as long as it wasn't her. In any case Gloria hadn't recognised her or there would have been a scene for she was sure to make something of it. 

"Be good. I won't be long." He told her. She heard the heavy security door slam. Turning quickly she saw Gloria rummaging through boxes on the floor searching for something. 

"I'll have the coffee. Put some sugar in it, two. Heaped." Gloria demanded. Nadine crept over to the small table by the couch to leave it there, not wanting to get close to the horrid female. Trying to be unobtrusive she slid onto the swivel chair before the computer and casually switched it on. 

"Hey! What are you doing?" Gloria shouted at her. "Daren never let me onto his computer, he hates anyone prying." 

"I was just going to check my mail." 

"Not on that you don't. He's got security you won't get far." Gloria grabbed a thin wrist pulling her from the chair. "I remember you from before, you're a sneaky stuck up brat. Sit over there and behave. I don't want trouble from you. Yea! You owe me a top from last time." Gloria reminded her. 

Trembling at the memory of fighting, when the young woman was babysitting her, was frightening yet the computer was so close she had to try something. "It's not yours, this isn't even your home. Just leave and let me be." Nadine complained. Pushing her out of the way Nadine made to sit at the computer only she didn't see the look of spitefulness on Gloria's face. 

With both arms around Nadine's waist Gloria lifted her off the ground to heft her onto the sofa. Gloria fell with the struggling woman bouncing onto the floor. Heavier and more used to fighting Gloria easily subdued the slightly built opponent ending up holding both wrists, with legs straddling her, with enough weight to hold her down. 

"Stop struggling. You had better not rip my top this time." Gloria warned her. In an attempt to throw her off Nadine had inadvertently shaken hair away from her face. With Gloria inches away it just took a brief moment to reveal the truth. "Hell! Mrs Brandon. What are you doing here? Bloody hell." The words accompanied a relaxation of the hold but Nadine froze at the words of recognition. She lay panting for breath too shocked to escape. 

Gloria recovered quickly leaning forward pinning the woman to the floor with all her weight. "You're not a kid. We baby-sat you that night. Bloody hell. Your husband went off with my mum while we baby-sat you. You've been playing around with Daren. Was it before we split up? You're a dirty cow. You're a right kinky bitch too. What kind of game are you playing Mrs Brandon?" Gloria stopped to think about this surprise. Here she was with her mothers neighbour, caught in a trap. She wondered how she could make use of the information that this woman was cheating on her husband with Daren. 

The mobile phone rang interrupting both women's thoughts. At least Gloria stopped shouting abuse at her. It didn't need telling, she was a slut and she had discovered that for herself. 

"OK! I'll be there. Give me ten minutes." Gloria rang off and looked over her victim. Get dressed your coming with me. 

"I can't." With a fierce look from Gloria she quickly added. "I've got nothing to wear." The hapless woman wrapped herself in both arms. 

"You came here dressed like that! Bloody hell. What's wrong with you woman." 

Nadine dare not tell her she was being blackmailed and had little choice but do as she was told even if it meant pandering to a randy young mans fantasies. Watching her rummage in another corner of the room she took a look around wondering where her coat was. 

"Here try this. A past girlfriend left it. It's too small for me but it'll fit you. Just do as I say, got it!" 

Nadine pulled the skirt on looking for the rest of it. With another fierce look from Gloria she pulled the top over her head. "I can't go out like this." She complained. Even without a mirror Nadine knew it was too little, too tight. The top was tied in a knot revealing her tummy and a lot of cleavage. The skirt tightly wrapped itself around the cheeks of her bottom threatening to ride up around her waist. With every step she would be revealing the stocking tops and suspender straps. 

"We're not going far. Just along the street. Don't worry; no one from our part of town will see you down here. I met this guy at a party. Come on get your arse in gear. If anyone sees you they won't be looking at your face." Gloria grabbed at her elbow pulling her out the door. With a thud of the door closing she felt sick being stuck out here dressed like a whore with this young woman who liked her less as an adult than as a rival. 

It was true there was no one on the streets and they stopped at a building on the next block to buzz an intercom. Another warehouse converted into studio apartments only this one looked respectable. The elevator was a box of glass and if there had been anyone in the foyer they would have seen her little white panties. The penthouse door was open. This too was sparsely decorated though more expensive. Wall to wall thick pile carpet, tapestry blinds hiding the floor to ceiling windows. 

Here there seemed little more personality than the interior decorators had managed. It was as though the character had been tidied away. The young man sitting at the computer explained the missing touch. He was easily recognisable as a soulless computer nerd. He looked only eighteen yet could have sat in for one of the much older corporate IT guys at her fathers company. The look was there, intense, solitary, a mouse busy in one hand. Were they born that way? 

"Where's Mickey?" Gloria asked. 

The guy didn't even flicker from concentrating on lines of meaningless characters dancing across the screen. "In his room." He spoke in a monotone. 

Winking at Nadine she said. "This is Nadine. Say hello to Nadine Brian." Gloria demanded. Still the guy stared seemingly mesmerised. 

"Hi." He uttered quietly without looking up. Gloria liked getting her own way. That's one of the reasons she broke up with Daren and why she liked these two geeks. They had plenty of money, which helped to. 

Before Nadine could react the skirt had been hiked up around her waist. While she was hopelessly pulling at it the top was pulled up too. It was tight with little room for her head and arms to struggle in. 

"Take a look at this Brian. A little present for you." Gloria meant the naughty sight of this woman in her underwear but an idea began to form. She had his attention now. He was shyer than his business partner and flat mate, but then Mickey needed leading along in things worldly too. Like what to buy a young woman when she had done something naughty for him. She didn't need taking out to clubs, preferring not to be seen with them, but she did need some spending money. 

Gloria whispered in her ear while holding the material bunched tight in a fist, the blouse wrapped around her head and arms where she still squirmed to get free. "You don't want me to tell anyone about your kinky little games do you?" Nadine stiffened, no longer struggling. "My mum would love such gossip. A few photos from my mobile would be enough." Gloria whispered. Nadine groaned. "I could easily send them to mum. You get the picture. I won't identify you as Mrs Brandon, I'll just call you Nadine." Gloria chuckled. "Do exactly as I tell you and your safe. Well, from mum." Gloria looked at Brian. "Safe enough here too really." 

Gloria tugged off the blouse with the bra tangled in it to dramatically throw them across the room. "Come on Nadine give Brian a thrill. Grind those hips." 

Expected to strip for this one-man audience was bad enough then she was pushed forward between his knees. It was difficult to tell who was more embarrassed. She was a mature married woman forced to lap dance before this young stranger. She bent forward to slip out of the skirt with her breasts almost slapping his face. Turned around she realised too late this was far worse. With the skirt removed she stood before him in white knickers contrasting vividly with a red face. 

With prodding from Gloria she peeled them off this time bending forward despite her large breasts brushing his face. He was responding to the show, which she hoped was nearly over. The directions from Gloria were demeaning but she had learnt to simply switch off and obey over the last few weeks with Daren. With a foot resting on his knee she stroked a stocking off one leg. All the time his eyes swivelled between her open crotch and the breasts heaving in his face. She had to lift the other leg exposing everything again. A nipple swung at him and this time he sucked it into his mouth holding on to it with the power of a vacuum pump. 

If it had been Daren she would have found it irresistible only now it felt horrid and painful. Was it just technique or was there something more to it. Gloria helped her escape before he bit it off. There were no words of thanks forming on her lips as she found herself bent before him with her face in his lap. 

"You've started something here so better finish it." Gloria growled in her ear. "No! I can't, please." Nadine hissed. Her eyes were closed in pain at the disgrace of it. Her brain was in turmoil seeming to be on the edge of a stroke. Ignoring what she had done with Daren she could only think of this sordid act. It was being forced upon her and would have to be tolerated in return for the young woman's silence. 

While the silent debate raged, whether to fight or give in, Gloria scooped him out of his trousers and pushed her victims head over it. With a mouthful of cock, or rather half a mouthful, the debate was resolved. Deciding to get it over with she used her new learnt skills to bring him off as quickly as possible. With a hand gently milking his sack the other ringed his penis while her lips tightened all along its length. With a gulp she swallowed its head, practised enough not to choke. 

Brian had watched the two women doing it to him. There they were at his feet, oblivious that it was Nadine doing all the work. To have one woman close was alarming, to have two was mind blowing. He watched mesmerised every movement not clearly seeing but feeling it all. Aware enough to feel his cock being sucked down her throat the moment was a trigger for his body to over rule the mind from what little control left and he came. 

Gloria was impressed. Without even a slight cough the woman had caught his load. Without thinking Nadine lifted her head, opening her mouth to displaying a tongue covered in sticky off white semen. Gloria grabbed her phone camera. Nadine's eyes were shut and the silent shutter needed no flash. So switched off from the ordeal Nadine waited as usual for the master to approve before swallowing. 

"Clean it up." Gloria told her quietly. Both had their eyes shut so Gloria just had to take advantage with the camera. She tucked him away leaving Brian very happy seeing Gloria handling him, for it confirmed both women had been doing it to him. 

The glossy beam of his smile seemed obscene to both Gloria and Nadine. She was pleased to be guided away from him until the moment she saw another young man, this one in bed. He was tall and thin and was waking up. It was afternoon and the bed looked neat, un-slept-in yet he had been in it several hours, from early this morning after a night surfing the web, contacting friends and conducting business. 

Pulling up the bottom of the sheet Gloria pushed her acolyte into the bed. She crawled under the sheet too expecting to claim some credit and to ensure the woman did the job. It was also fascinating to have such power over an adult. Gloria supposed she too was an adult at eighteen but this woman was a neighbour, a fully paid up member of the community. To have her blow these two geeks was, well, mind blowing. Awesome.  

===

This time no prompting was needed as the woman was in automatic drive taking no notice of what she was doing yet in perfect control of the stiff member. All the right moves at the right time were performed until he too came. She watched in fascination the open mouth displaying a load. Gloria had videoed the whole chore wondering what was going on with Daren for her to act like this. Surely she should have put up a bit of a fight and not given in so easily. 

**** 

Nadine was busy trying not to think about what she had done with these two young men. Gloria had given her the dress and blouse without the underwear and she had been so eager to dress she didn't argue. 

"Well Brian, Mickey. Hope you liked your present celebrating two weeks since we met at that party. You need to pay her now; she's a working girl. Come on guys. The woman's got to earn a living." Gloria encouraged them. 

Nadine looked painfully at Gloria but the nod told her she would have to take the money they eagerly handed over. She was wealthy even without her husbands finances yet here she was being paid for sex like some common whore. She was dressed like one and acted like one so now she was being paid like one. The guys were sweet making a fuss of them both. Though Brian was careful not to mention Gloria's part in his pleasure in front of Mickey. 

When Gloria mentioned they might like to try a little more of her friend some time they eagerly smiled, nodded and agreed. Mickey was caught between being enthusiastic and declining, for wasn't Gloria his sort of girlfriend, so shouldn't she object. Gloria read the words forming in his mind as though a billboard were being pasted across his forehead, enjoying the conflict read there. 

Once outside Gloria snatched the money and smiled sweetly. "You don't want to keep the evidence of your whoring do you. I had better get you back to lover boy. You seem a little unsteady on those heels are your legs feeling weak?" 

Nadine walked slowly along the rough sidewalk thinking she had behaved like a whore, been paid like a whore and was dressed like one. She was a whore. It wasn't just Daren now. She had turned into a slut ready to pleasure anyone. As they reached the door to Daren's hideaway she wondered what could possibly be more degrading than this.  

===

Chapter 4 

Freedom at last! 

"Here they are! I've found Daren's secret videos!" Gloria laughed. Her eyes flashed reflecting her deep red hair with a look of the devil. 

Nadine hesitated over the mundane task of making coffee for the horrible girl. Daren was only eighteen but he had her at his mercy, through blackmail, and Gloria had taken advantage of the situation. As soon as he left the apartment Gloria had dressed her up like a cheap whore dragging her out to a couple of computer geek friends. 

She was still shaking from the dreadful act forced upon her by this young eighteen year old girl. She sucked their cocks dry, for money, and Gloria had pocketed the cash. They were back in Daren's apartment but she didn't feel safe. She felt so humiliated from being whored out she wanted to collapse in the corner and cry her eyes out. 

Pulling herself together she poured extra milk in the coffee to cool it down as she needed to get rid of a nasty taste in her mouth. She had already rinsed and gargled then scrubbed her teeth with toothpaste on a finger, but the nasty salty taste of sperm still lingered in her mouth and nostrils. 

"These are the disks he keeps his naughty photos and film on," Gloria announced. 

A gleam of hope lit Nadine's eyes. If the young woman had found the damning pictures Daren had taken of her she would be free. Sometime ago she wondered if freedom from this sordid affair was really wanted but recently it had gone too far. He was becoming more demanding and she was giving in to him under the threat of blackmail. 

"Here's your coffee, what's so interesting then?" Nadine asked, trying not to reveal a building excitement. 

"These disks, they were just hidden among his music and movies," she laughed. "They're video's of Daren and me doing it. Right here in this apartment," Gloria said, looking over the place wistfully. "You too I guess." 

Nadine almost spilled the coffee. She had been looking for a way into his computer for something nasty copied from his camera phone. The thought of all those sordid performances since then being recorded too, right here, was alarming. 

"I don't think he would use them, I just don't like the idea of them existing. Are you all right? Sit down, put your head between your knees," Gloria saw her swaying as though swooning. With both arms around the woman Gloria guided her to the sofa. 

"Didn't you know? He has miniature cameras all over the place," she explained, not making it any easier for Nadine to accept. "No! He doesn't keep anything on the computer, it's all right here. So it wasn't emails you were interested in on his computer. Relax, it's OK, we have the evidence now," Gloria laughed and rattled with a smokers cough. 

*** 

That first time she had been so shocked over the thought of being exposed in public, and her husband finding out, she just caved in. She remembered him stroking her, soothing her anxiety, taking over the responsibility for what she had done that first evening. 

Her husband had let them think she was his niece and a neighbour had arranged for her daughter to babysit. It had all started as a silly game, letting them babysit her, but it had ended with her being spanked like a naughty little girl. These two youngsters were in charge of her and she had enjoyed being controlled by them. The simple fact of enjoying being controlled was one of the reasons she let Daren control her, though she was still unaware of it. 

Next morning he came round with naughty photos of her cavorting with Gloria and Daren then being spanked by him. She gave in to him without making a decision, just going along with it, letting him take her. Once he had used her that first time it was easier submitting to his demands, especially with the ever present threat of blackmail hanging over her. 

Pictures of the rude things she had done for him recently flashed through her mind filling her with remorse. Any movies of them together would look as though she wanted to be there rather than being forced to submit. He had made her tell him what she wanted, awful vulgar sexual things and that was all on one of the disks Gloria was holding. 

She had dressed in feminine frilly underwear, lewd hooker styles and see- through clothing. Her breasts had been on display over a quarter cup corset with her pussy hardly covered by a thong and a bare bottom. Another time she had arrived from an important business meeting dressed in an expensive business suit and danced a striptease for him. 

As he became bored the demands became more humiliating. The filthy sexual acts where she debased herself were the worst. A recording of her crawling along the floor to his penis where she worshipped it with lips and tongue were on one of those disks. It just seemed so dreadful, it was overwhelming. 

*** 

Outside Daren's apartment they stood chatting, smiling together at having escaped him at last. All thoughts of what Gloria had made her do were forgotten as the blackmail threat was finally broken. Nadine took a deep breath of air, free, invigorating, intoxicating air. "It's so easy to take for granted the simple things in life Gloria, just being alive is wonderful," Nadine smiled with pleasure. 

Nadine felt like a young girl again with a best friend, enjoying each others company, sharing a wonderful moment. They both spoke together decrying Daren for blackmailing her, yet laughing at having broken free. 

"We'll look at them to check I'm right and we have everything. I know he keeps nothing on the computer and that he only keeps one copy and this is it!" Gloria laughed. 

"At least he didn't make you do things," Nadine said, her voice quavering with pent up emotion. 

"How do you know what he did to me before you came along? OK! I admit it, he didn't dare!" Gloria snorted at the idea of Daren making her do anything she didn't want to. "I just didn't like the idea of him having photos and videos of us together, in case he decided to put them up on the web or something," she said, while rummaging around in her shoulder bag for a cigarette. 

"So, what did he get you to do?" Gloria asked, with a smirk. She stopped fiddling on remembering she gave up a few days ago. She took a long cool look at the woman. Nadine wasn't as old as her mother, more attractive in a fresh innocent sort of way, but was a much more sensible and responsible woman. She wondered what Darren had on her and what they had been up to. 

Nadine's face was red with embarrassment. She looked down at the ground between them after being reminded of the awful things she had done with Daren. She had only relented to those demands under the threat of having those disgusting pictures released into the community. It was embarrassing having Gloria know about it. 

It was disturbing to think how completely she had submitted to him. An article in a Sunday magazine described how a kidnap victim became dependent upon the kidnapper until they identified with them and began to fully co-operate. Was this just a convenient excuse? 

"From what I saw when I came in, you dressed up for him in sexy underwear, I never did that!" Gloria chuckled. "You must have enjoyed being with a young handsome man, otherwise you would have called his bluff," Gloria surmised. 

"Maybe, yes, I did enjoy it at first," Nadine said with a wistful look in her eyes. It was natural to enjoy the attention and enjoy enthusiastic uninhibited sex with a young eighteen year old. What was so worrying was that she dropped her moral standards so completely, letting him do whatever he wanted with her. 

"Come on don't think about it so much, just put it down to experience and move on," Gloria said, digging her in the ribs with a sharp elbow. 

They burst into laughter, verging on hysteria as far as Nadine was concerned. It was an emotional relief and the suppressed feelings were bursting free. She would miss him though. She remembered him holding her tight and smiled. 

*** 

It all happened so quick Nadine didn't take it in. She reached down to her new friend pulling her up off the footpath. She watched bemused as Gloria brushed herself down while cursing casually. 

"Damn fucking idiot not looking where he's going. Where's my bag? Shit! Bastard! Fucking hell! Wait till I get a hold of you, I'll ring your fucking neck!" Gloria shouted down the now empty street. 

Nadine looked around obviously bemused and a little battered from the shouted expletives exploding from the young woman. A young guy on a motorbike had grabbed Gloria's bag. 

"Oh! No! He's grabbed the Disks!" Nadine wailed. 

"Don't worry. He'll probably pull my wallet and dump the rest. I'll find out who it is for sure. It'll be one of my friend's brothers, or at least they will know who's got a noisy little bike," Gloria hissed through clenched teeth. 

*** 

"You seem distracted, Nadine," one of the new directors commented. Joe had worked for her father for so many years he felt he had the privilege to use a first name. 

"I'm just a little tired that's all," she smiled, trying to shake off the troubled thoughts. The meeting had droned on too long leaving her thoughts to wander over the last few days. Having handed over the family business to these directors there was no need for her to be there but they had invited her as a mark of respect. 

Her father had built up the business from scratch into a thriving multi- national company and died a happy man. She knew the business inside out but had to back off its day to day affairs or follow her father into an early grave. It was still small enough that the individual employee counted but it was a substantial business ready to go public, needing careful professional management. 

She wondered how long the respect would last if her nasty little secret was to go public. Cavorting with that young man Daren might just be withstood, if the photos weren't released, but what had happened with Gloria would be a horrendous humiliation to face. She would have to run and hide away somewhere. 

The pleasantries and formalities were over and so she made her way home. 

*** 

"That you Nadine? Oh! You sound so posh on the phone. Hey! I've found out the little bastard who stole my bag. We need to put the frighteners on him to get him to blab where he dumped it. I'm sure you more than me don't want the stuff found. So, are you up for it?" Gloria asked. 

It was true she needed those disks back more than Gloria did. They showed obscene performances with Daren in the apartment as well as the original naughty episode. If she had known he was filming her in his apartment she would have run a mile. 

The evidence of her crawling around on all fours as a young man's sex pet was so demeaning and damnable she wanted to curl up and cry. She had even begged him to fuck her! The thought of anyone seeing this on the internet was appalling. She would never be able to hold her head up again. 

Thinking about them being somewhere out there ready to be discovered made her cringe. She had thought of herself as a sensible business woman, respected in the community, until recently. If anyone saw that disk a demotion to filthy slut would be called for. 

"I'm so glad you found out who has them, they do still have them don't they?" Nadine asked desperately. 

"The word is he has the bag with everything in it stashed away. He usually sells the credit cards then waits a few weeks to get rid of everything else, probably on the internet," Gloria recounted. 

Nadine quaked at the sound of the word internet. "I'm in your hands Gloria, you know best, what ever you say," Nadine confirmed. Not having time to think about what the girl meant Nadine agreed. 

*** 

A quick walk next door and she was soon upstairs in Gloria's bedroom. It made sense to change from her business suit into something of Gloria's, so as not to look like a threatening adult. They found something in the back of a wardrobe that was nearer Nadine's smaller size. While changing she enjoyed the girl talk, beginning to feel like an adolescent, sharing secrets with a girlfriend. 

She had been an only child and close to her father. There hadn't been the opportunity for girly things. She had spent her time pleasing daddy, taking an interest in the business from an early age. She had been a swot at school then at Business College there had been no time for boys. 

"We'll have to hurry he'll be here at eight," Gloria told her, while fixing her hair. 

"You make it sound like a date," Nadine said. 

"It is. How else do you think I got him to come over," Gloria said with a frown creasing her brow. Nadine was so slow sometimes Gloria wondered how the woman survived in the cut throat business world. "It must be experience and image I guess. Never mind, just thinking out loud, hold still while I do your hair," Gloria demanded. 

Nadine capitulated easily; after weeks of having to obey Daren's every whim this little deception was nothing. Perhaps it was like giving up drugs - the empty feeling - for she was missing Daren. It wasn't just the sex it also left a great big hole in her day. He had become so demanding even when at home she had to find clothes or some toy for their next tryst. 

"You sure about this, I feel silly trying to look like a teenager. Am I really the blind date?" Nadine asked, with a worried look on her face yet with a rush of excitement too. A suspicion was turning to a certainty on looking at Gloria in the mirror. With a rapidly rising pulse and evident rise in her voice she squeaked out, "I'm the date for this young guy?" 

"You'll be fine. Just sweet talk him and we'll get what we want," Gloria huffed, not prepared to let the woman back out. "I think you can get away with it. You have smooth peachy skin and by the time he arrives it will be dark out. Even under lights you look young. It's the clothes and hair and the way you act that will make the difference. Don't worry, once in a club no one will notice," Gloria said, trying to calm her down. Her hair and clothes were styled for the image and most people didn't bother to look past the image. 

"I look like a thirty year old pretending to be twelve," Nadine complained. The door bell rang cutting short the beginnings of an argument. Gloria dragged her down to meet the blind date. Peter had just turned eighteen but looked younger and she felt ridiculous. 

A few false piercing pins in a lip, nose and ears were a distraction she hoped might work. A yellow top tied tight under her breasts, holding them up into a deep cleavage, formed another distraction. The flouncy little yellow skirt swayed seductively with her hips and only just covered her ass. 

On her feet she wore a pair of simple canvas flats with a thin sole and heel which helped lose an inch of height. Her hair was brushed straight and pulled back into a pony tail. She felt small and vulnerable. In the soft shoes she was smaller than those around her and in such a skimpy outfit she was exposed. 

What brought on the feeling more than anything was the fear of being found out and laughed at. She was a mature woman not some little airhead out for fun. If those around her found out, or even worse someone she knew, saw through the disguise she would simply curl up and die. 

*** 

The nervousness worked in her favour. Rather than presenting the image of a confident business woman she appeared to be an anxious teen. She hardly spoke on the journey to a club but it seemed Gloria was right. He accepted her for what they presented, a teenage girl, his date for the evening. 

Gloria introduced her then distracted him by dominating the conversation. She explained her boyfriend was delayed so would join them at the club. He seemed relaxed and didn't appear to have any doubts about her at all. 

In the club the noise was too much for Nadine. Even without Gloria's protection there was no way she could say the wrong thing for she couldn't hear or be heard. They made for the terrace where it was quieter and cooler but Gloria sloped off on the way. 

"So what college do you go to?" Peter asked. 

She named one hoping it was right but he didn't seem to be listening. She had the urge to gyrate her breasts in an attempt to hypnotise him, for he hadn't taken his eyes off her cleavage for one moment. Instead she put on a silly little voice. "Do you want to hear a secret?" she giggled. "You promise not to tell Gloria? Well, since visiting them I've been shoplifting! Have I shocked you?" she asked, with a daring look on her face. 

He at last looked in her face and smiled. "Well it's your turn now!" she complained. 

He shrugged as though he had nothing to tell or wasn't prepared to share. 

"If you beat mine I'll let you kiss me," she encouraged. 

"I've snatched a bag in the street," he said guardedly, watching her face for a reaction. 

"Wow! That beats mine, I guess," Nadine said, looking as though this was unexpected. Inside she was so pleased with herself she had to try hard not to let it show. 

"I'm wearing my ill gotten gains," she said, with a big smile and stood back with arms outstretched. "Everything I'm wearing was stolen from stores in the mall," she said seriously. "Where's your loot?" she asked, with a sideways glance meant to entice him. 

"What about the kiss first, don't you believe me?" Peter stated. 

She stood in front of him not having to act reluctant and nervous but having to add some nonchalance as though she didn't care if he kissed her or not. She felt the young date wrap his arms around her holding on tight. She didn't move, feigning inexperience and youthful self-consciousness. It was easy for she felt like a nervous teen anyway. 

She hadn't meant to open her mouth but it was an auto-reaction from the touch of his lips. They were firm, dry and the gentle sensitive touch sent tingles right through her. He unexpectedly sucked hard, pulling her tongue into his mouth, which was a surprise, when she thought he would delve in with inexperience. He nibbled and licked her tongue. Pulling her tongue back brought his into her mouth too. 

It flicked around her tongue and mouth, lightly darting here and there with light sensitive touches. Every touch was like little electric shocks. He nibbled and licked her lips then again slipped into her mouth. He was making love to her with his tongue and it felt as though he were taking her, consuming her body. She surrendered to him with an open mouth unresisting to his caresses. 

It went on and on until she started to breath heavily though her nose. She couldn't get enough of him and began to explore his mouth in return. So much stimulation blocked out everything else. She didn't feel his leg between her thighs or her legs gripping it tight. She was even unaware that she rubbed her crotch on his leg like a wanton hussy. 

Nadine felt a hand on her breast but couldn't take a break from the overload of wonderful sensations assaulting her to deal with it. She new adolescents would spend a long time kissing but she hadn't and thought she was passed it. She had never experienced such sensuousness from a kiss and found it overwhelming. She let the young man grip her breast thinking it must be a thrill for him. Surely he would have to come up for air soon; then she would bring things back under control. 

She felt him pinching a nipple hard and it was rivalling the sensations buzzing her tongue. It was adding to and multiplying the vibrations filling her mind. Without thought she pressed her crotch onto his leg, gripping it hard. 

A slight movement alerted her to something even more unexpected. She froze with his tongue and fingers continuing to sensitise her body. It vibrated like a tuning fork tingling to his touch. What was so unexpected was a slight movement at her crotch. It squirmed again so now she was sure. His fingers were at her crotch though not yet in her panties.  

===

She had inadvertently pressed herself against them and every wriggle sent a shiver up her spine. "No! Stop it, please," she moaned around his tongue. His kisses had turned her on then the nipple squeeze heated her up. His fingers were pressed against her clitoris with the slightest movement sending demanding messages to her brain. She should unwrap her legs from around his hand but hadn't the will power. 

She was a mature experienced woman yet this young kid had her panting for more. It was worryingly embarrassing. A hand easily pushed up the top to find a nipple and the skirt was too short to fend off the most casual attempt. More than that the skirt was a temptation to any hand and his was well up there playing her sensitive bits like a musical instrument. Any moment she would begin to sing in tune to his fiddle. 

"Please, stop, you mustn't do it to me," she pleaded. The words revealed her resistance had failed. She was telling him it was up to him how far he went. She couldn't tell him she was a responsible married woman, nor could it be denied she was a little slut out for a good time. The idea that this young lad had brought her to this sorry state was dreadful. 

It was humiliating to face how weak and how easily pushed over the edge of no return she had become. If he decided to take her she would let him, maybe even let herself go. A small conscious reasoning part of her mind knew, with little encouragement, she would ride his cock for a desperately needed orgasm. 

"What are you two up to?" Gloria chimed in. 

The bell like tones rang out separating the two boxers from a clinch. Nadine shook her head to clear it and pulled at the little skirt. Looking down both hands shot up to pull the top over an exposed breast. She fiddled with her hair not knowing what to do or say. She had been caught red handed and her face was shaded to match them. 

She looked at him, a stranger, yet he had a breast and her pussy in his hands. More than that he had brought her to such a sexual pitch he had her whole body in his hands. She felt stupid in front of Gloria who knew she was supposed to be a responsible person not a stupid slut. 

"If you come home with me I'll show you the stuff," he whispered. 

Nadine almost too eagerly agreed. From now on she would have to be careful with him knowing he wasn't an inept schoolboy after all. She couldn't let him take advantage again not after what nearly happened. She hated to think what she would have done if Gloria hadn't interrupted them. 

"Let's dance first," she told him, and took his hand, leading him to the dance floor. It was creepy knowing the hand had been between her legs pressing her little button. On the dance floor they hardly moved yet danced as much as anyone else to the rhythm. She began to notice some of the girls were looking at her, sharing words and smirks. 

Word was going around about their lewd performance on the balcony. There had been others out there, kissing, though less passionately, not making a spectacle of themselves. 

The pace changed to a slow number and again she found herself in his arms. She refused to let him kiss her by moving her lips away but he found a suitable spot anyway. His lips roved over her neck, exposed with her hair dragged back into a ponytail. His hot breath, little nibbles, and licks to her neck were destroying the resolve to resist. She began to tingle all over. 

"Let's go!" she shouted in his ear. It was the last thing she wanted, to be going home with him, but it meant escaping, running away from the club and his touch. Besides, anything would be endured to find Gloria's bag and most of all, grabbing the precious disks. 

*** 

Nadine was surprised at the size of the young mans house after thinking he came from a poor part of town. It was a new build in the hills overlooking the city; it was bigger and better than her home. The furnishings looked old meaning they came from the previous residents. 

"Mom would have loved this place but she died before we moved in," Peter told her. He was responding the enquiring look as she scanned the place. 

Nadine realised why there seemed to be no character in the place. The small feminine touches that made a house into a home were missing. She surmised his father had abandoned him to, perhaps too wrapped up in his own feelings of remorse, then burying his head in a business. She felt like telling him to get on board or else. 

"He's having a meeting out by the pool so it's off limits," Peter casually remarked. 

"We can go up to your room then," she said. On seeing his eyes light up she change her mind. Her voice had sounded too eager. "I meant lets keep out of your father's way," she added quickly. 

"We don't have to it's my house too!" he said, a little too fiercely. "You hungry want something to drink?" he asked. 

She was about to say a whisky and water, but stopped herself in time. "Yea, that sounds cool. I haven't had anything since, err, school," she told him. She almost mentioned the business meeting so made a mental note not to relax her guard. He was turning out to be a nice young man so maybe she should just ask him for the bag. 

They chatted in the kitchen about nothing much, between mouthfuls, until he mentioned his bike. "I've never been on a bike, can you take a passenger?" she asked. 

"Yea of course, it's not a big one and it doesn't go fast so you won't be scared," he enthused. 

She giggled with a hand over her mouth. "Do you hang out by the old warehouses?" she asked. When he nodded then tried to deny it she burst into laughter. "That bag you snatched, was it Gloria's?" He looked surprised then affronted. "It's OK! I wont tell her and you wont tell her I shoplift, OK?" she teased. 

"OK! But it might not be hers," he said. He relaxed enough to smile at the coincidence. Not knowing it had been contrived. 

"How funny is that, I'd just love it if it were Gloria's," she reflected. 

"We could check it out in my room, if you like?" he smiled a challenge. 

"You've still got it, that's great. Again your room, what do you have in there? Something for a girl that's big and exciting?" she teased. It was going too far but she couldn't help herself. He was so susceptible to teasing; she liked the way he dropped his head to one side. He looked up at her with a half grin, pinking up, it was cute. 

He acted tough but was shy with her when pushed with playful innuendo. Standing close she realised he was a big hunk of a lad. He would have been on the football team had he been given more attention at home and not left to get into trouble. She looked up at him, for once meeting eye to eye. A thought drifted across her mind that she would be delighted to be his special cheerleader. 

A squishy feeling between the legs warned her she was drifting into something foolish. She tried to remind herself she was a mature married woman with important commitments. It was several years too late to have an adolescent crush on a lovely guy who held her tight and kissed so adorably. 

He put his hand under her chin meaning to lift her lips to his. The moment felt so romantic and so right she let him touch her lips with his. This time he hadn't grabbed her and forced himself on her. If he had she might have given in but he was unaware of her need to be dominated. 

He gently kissed her lips, her eyelids, her cheeks and continued gently planting soft kisses over her face. He wasn't holding onto her but she was held tightly in the grip of a deep infatuation. Gloria had started the process by dressing her as a youngster and he had continued it, reducing her to a simpering love struck adolescent. The soft caresses held her close to him and the bonds tightened with every kiss. 

"Peter, we mustn't. I don't think its right, your nice but, I need to tell you about me and then you won't want me," she gabbled in a constricted voice that sounded like she was trying to hold it all back. 

He took hold of her hand leading her out of the kitchen to his bedroom. She floated along like a love struck puppy only she was an experienced woman with powerful needs and was used to satisfying them. Since being with Daren she had learnt to submit to anything to get what she wanted. 

A small part of her mind warned her she was too far gone to resist, that he was taking her to his bed. She wasn't completely oblivious to the warning but simply ignored it. 

"Hi Peter," a young man said. 

Peter didn't want to stop and chat but a desire to show her off stopped him. "Hi. This is Nadine, Brian," he said. The introduction was brief intended to pass the message they didn't want to linger. 

He didn't decode the message and just stood there enjoying the sight of Peter's scantily clad girl. He wasn't much older than Peter but a year or two meant a lot to a teen, besides, he was here at a business meeting with Peter's father. That was enough for Peter to put him down as an enemy. 

Nadine caught him staring at her boobs. She wasn't used to wearing such flimsy clothes or keeping them in check and a nipple was threatening to pop out. She pulled at the top roughly, annoyed at the stranger so obviously ogling her body. With the top in place she looked him in they eye attempting to display anger. 

She couldn't look away from him. It was that Brian! Last time they met he handed her a bunch of notes for a blow job. To him she was a prostitute, but then anyone would think the same, for she had taken money for sex so how could she be anything other than whore. 

He hadn't recognised her for he was too busy examining her body. She felt so crushed she might slip under one of the doors to escape. Before she could think what to do or say the calamity escalated with his friend Mickey turning up. They both blocked the corridor now. Nadine cringed with fear of discovery and the consequent humiliation. 

"Hi Peter what you up to? Its Nadine isn't it? Gloria's little friend," he stated. He took her hand to shake it as though he were a mature businessman, practising no doubt due to the meeting with Peter's father. He was only a couple of years older than Peter but seemed full of himself. 

If it had just been the clothes she wore she would have put him in his place, for she was a mature experienced business woman whereas he was just a pretentious kid. She couldn't even ignore the pompous ass as he held a vital piece of information that dare not be exposed. He was too full of his own importance to let her break into the conversation let alone dominate it. She kept trying to break in, to steer it away from Gloria. 

"I've made a deal with your father, Peter. He's given us access to the company computers to develop our software," he looked down his nose at Nadine then condescended to smile at her. "I'll need a secretary do you think you could handle the job Nadine? It would be better than your present occupation," he suggested. 

Taking the chance to jump in she decided to flatter him. "Yes I'd love to be your secretary, I'm sure I could manage it. Will you have a large office," she asked. At last the danger was passing for he was talking about himself with the obvious intention of keeping it that way. 

"Oh yes I've been promised a corner office. We'll take on a few more programmers and with your experience you could entertain them, keep up moral," he said. She groaned quietly which satisfied and encouraged him. "Instead of being an under-manager you could be an under-the-desk manager. Look after all the programmers little needs. Do you do women too?" Mickey asked. 

Nadine flinched as though struck. She wasn't dressed much less sluttish than when she had sucked them both off. Perhaps she should just get down on her knees right now to keep him quiet. It would put them in their proper places in his eyes, having the little whore on her knees, wrapped around his cock. What worried her was that she felt as though that was her place. 

Struck dumb she couldn't answer or steer the conversation onto safer ground. Peter was bored with the guy so wasn't listening though what he had caught brought a quizzical look to his face while trying to fathom what was going on. 

"Gloria brought her round as a treat for us both. Well, I guess it's private, or maybe not. I guess as a professional you don't mind advertising your goods," he winked at her. 

Nadine was a wealthy business woman being talked to by this pretentious young kid as though she were a bimbo slut. It was confirmed now he had been just toying with her, intending all along to tell Peter. 

"She gives good head and deep throats too. What did we pay her Brian?" Mickey asked his partner. 

Peter didn't say a word. He grabbed her hand and pushed past the two guys, dragging her away. If his mood had been eager she would have understood and been able to cope with that but he was hurt and angry. 

"I'm sorry!" she said slowly and quietly. 

"Was that what you were trying to tell me earlier?" he asked. 

She shrugged, for what could be said now. As far as these lads were concerned she was a prostitute and nothing more. She had tried to tell him she was a woman, an older woman, not a young teenager like him. In the daylight, when she got up in the morning, with all this make-up washed away or he actually looked at her properly, he would see and know. 

It was time for her cousin to go home and for her to return to a normal life. "The bag, you got it?" she asked. She watched him drag it from under the bed. Not a very original hiding place but then he probably didn't care about getting caught. 

This was more awkward than taking that money from those little pricks. He looked at her accusing her of more than theft. He was hurting as though she had been a long time girlfriend not just someone he had just met. They had clicked, something special, she knew that; it was just the wrong place and time, a decade or two wrong. 

"I'll pay you with this," he said, hefting Gloria's bag. 

"Just give me the bag Peter," she said. 

"You want it. You know what to do, you're a professional," he spat at her. 

She closed in to pull the bag away from him but he got a hold of her hair, pulling her face over his cock. She was breathing heavily snorting snot and tears. She opened her mouth reluctantly gulping him in. He let go of her hair as she began to work him over. 

Anger had kept his cock soft but the emotion quickly flipped to passion. She worked it hard with her tongue licking and sucking on it, massaging his balls with a hand. Soon it was long enough to swallow. 

She continued crying silently somehow wanting to please him yet desperate for it to be finished. As his cock hardened she told herself it would all soon be over, this and the threat of blackmail. The made up cousin could disappear never to return. 

It was no longer Peter fucking her face. The hard cock was anonymous and she was just doing a job of work. She was a professional, a prostitute working to earn a payment for blowing a young man. 

On her knees beside the bed she lifted her head to him showing his seed on her tongue. The action was partly a habitual behaviour by someone switched off, working on automatic, so as not to think about what they were doing. Her eyes opened up wide with the message beaming at him. 'Look what you have done to me,' she seemed to be saying. 

"What the hell is going on here?" Mathew shouted. His voice was hardly raised but in the intense silence between them it impinged stridently. Peter's father had been told about the whore and had hurried over to his son's bedroom to confirm the worst. 

Peter thrust the bag into her arms. His father pulled her up by an arm and marched her back down the corridor to the pool. 

Nadine covered her face with both hands, as though her shame could be hidden. "Your nothing but a dirty little slut, how did you latch on to my son? You'll not be paid for that despicable behaviour. You disgust me. You'll not stay here long enough to pollute my home. I'm taking you home and telling your parents, I'll make sure they do something about you too," he ranted. 

What will her husband think if she is delivered home with this disgusting experience revealed? He would be angry enough with her from the way she was dressed but hearing she had given this man's son a blowjob, it would shatter him. It seemed so much more sickening having done this thing with Peter after they had become close. 

It left her feeling dejected and worthless. It was all her fault she had let everyone including herself down. She deserved to be pilloried in the village square. 

"Please sir, don't take me home, don't tell my parents," she wailed. The last thing she wanted was to be discovered now she had the disks. The nightmare should be over, would be over once away from here but not if he took her home. The whole sordid tail was sure to surface. 

"You should be punished for your behaviour and what you did to my son. He's only eighteen. I don't suppose you are much older but I don't want a trollop like you poisoning my son and home. I don't want to hear your sordid story either," he said, with a voice full of menace. 

She felt as bad as he described and agreed she didn't deserve to go unpunished. "My parents don't care. If you want me punished you'll have to punish me yourself, unless you're all talk," she snipped at him. 

"Little bitch, come here," he told her. In a fit of pique he pulled her over his knee and slapped her ass. She bit her lip not making a sound. This wound him up, not hearing a sound of complaint or contrition. 

He slapped her again. All she could think about was the pleasure she would receive, would have received if it had been Daren spanking her. He slapped her ass again. She opened her legs to relieve the heat building there. He saw an obvious wet patch in the crotch of the thong, could smell her sex. He slapped her bare ass again, less hard this time. 

Taking more notice in the fading light he noticed she was cleanly shaved. Her folds of female flesh were escaping, unfolding from the crotch of the panties, emerging glistening wet. He slapped a cheek, this time a caress more than a punishment. She moaned a thick guttural noise a sign that she had given in to her bodily needs. 

He lifted her up to face him pulling her legs either side of his knees. His cock was already out and sticking up between them. She opened her eyes as tiny slits wondering what was happening. This was unusual and it wasn't Daren. She recognised who it was! 

She hadn't looked, purposely looking away not wanting to show her face, too ashamed. This man was Mathew. He was major business rival, a constant thorn in her father's side for many years and before him his father was too. They had almost bankrupted him once. Even now she had to be careful he didn't seduce the shareholders in a hostile takeover. 

She was about to berate him to hit him with her fists but bit her lip instead. His eyes were shut as hers had been while he spanked her. She was angry so angry it hurt, but couldn't move. This was more devastating than anything ever experienced in her life. 

To be recognised by those boys was one thing but this man was an arch business rival. She had challenged him over the board room table to do his worst and she had won the vote of confidence it had taken to bring the company, her fathers company, back under her control. 

He had organised a bye-up of shares under different names so it was still a close thing if a vote was called for and he declared his hand. She was determined not to sell out her father's legacy to this snake. 

In a way he had already shown his hand. He had spanked her like a naughty little girl. She was still the majority shareholder but here over his lap she was helpless. He had only to recognise who she was and the scandal would crush the share holders' confidence in her. She would lose the company in a takeover, his takeover of her company.

She held her breath willing him to keep his eyes closed, not daring to move. He lowered her into his lap a little further. She felt the head of his cock touch. Her mouth opened to scream but she bit her lip and looked up at the stars. Her eyes glistened with tears. 

She was a rich powerful woman but right now she was helpless to stop this man from driving his cock into her and fucking her. After so much stimulation from his son and having the usual spanking from a dominant she was too aroused to want to stop. She felt his cock push against her inner lips its head pushing at her vagina. Her mind reeled at the touch, wanting it but hating that it had to be him. 

If she could have moved she would have thrust down burring him deep into her welcoming hole. She needed it and wanted it and must have it, now! "Please! Oh! Yes! More, harder," she demanded, in a whisper that he probably didn't hear. 

She was the subject of a takeover now. He had her, was having her, taking her, making her his; at that moment he owned her body and mind. 

It had been many months since he had taken time to even look at a woman and even then he felt guilty as though it were disloyal. This didn't count because she was just a prostitute. Besides, his wife had been dead for over a year. So now he gave way completely, to just fuck the silly little slut. Report_Story
