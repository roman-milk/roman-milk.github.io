title: Marty Misbehaves

#1 

===

It was a large project and it had been occupying all my time for almost a year and when I say all my time I mean just that. I worked until late at night and I brought work home with me to do on weekends. The survival of the company I worked for, and by extension, my survival, depended on the project being finished on time and on or under budget. 

My wife was not happy. 

The thing I heard most was "Bullshit. You can find a job anywhere else you want to," and that was probably true, but it would also have meant starting over at sixty percent less pay and benefits and throwing away the sixteen years that I had invested in my job. To me that would not have been a rational decision, but then rational decisions and my wife Marty cannot coexist in the same room. 

It did not matter to Marty that I was busting my ass for our future financial security. All that mattered to her was: 

- You never take me anywhere any more. 

- You never spend any time with me. 

- I'm tired of being here with nothing to do except watch TV. 

- All you ever think about is that stupid job. 

- When you are home you are always too tired to do anything with me. 

- You like what is in your briefcase more than what is in this dress. 

Finally, after several months of her harping I lost it. It had been a very bad day. A couple of deliveries not made on time; one delivery came in not to specs and had to be refused, one man lost for at least two weeks to an occupational injury and one of my best men had quit. I walked in the door and hadn't even set my briefcase down before Marty started in on me. It was the final straw. 

"Shut the fuck up Marty. If your life is so fucking bad just pack up and get out. Go find yourself some twit that can't even come close to making his salary match your spending habits. You didn't mind my job when it made the money that got you this house and everything in it. Now I'm working the same job trying to make sure we keep all of it and I don't want to hear another fucking word from you about it." 

Marty just stared at me for a minute and then she said, "Okay Bill, if that's the way you want it, but I'm going to take the last word here. Last weekend you told me that you were too busy to go to John's party and you told me to go by myself if I needed to get out of the house and so I did. You know who else was at the party Bill? Ron Holbrook, Harry Short and their wives. The names ring a bell Bill? Ron is your supervisor I believe and the last I heard Harry still owned the company you work for. They can relax and take their wives to parties and have a good time and you can't? There is something wrong with that picture Bill. Either something is going on that you are not telling me or they are playing you for a chump." 

"No one is playing me for a chump, and..." Marty held up her hand to stop me. 

"Here's the deal Bill. You go ahead and be their slave, but I'm not going to stay cooped up in this house while you do it. Get used to me not being here in the evening because I'm going to have a life. Dinner will always be ready, the house will always be clean and the laundry will be done. But while you are in your home office or working late at the job site I'm going to be out enjoying myself." 

Then she turned away from me and walked into the kitchen. I didn't waste my time trying to explain to her that Ron had already announced he was retiring at the end of the project whether it succeeded or not. And that Harry was a multi- millionaire and that the company's closing it's doors only meant more time available for him to jet to Aspen or wherever. She wouldn't, or couldn't, understand that I was working for my future, not some one else's. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next day was Friday and when I got home I found Marty getting dressed to go out. She already had her heels and hose on and was just slipping into her dress when I came into the bedroom. I watched for a bit and then said, "Going out?" 

"Yes." 

"Where?" 

"I don't know yet. Mary and Robin are going to pick me up and then we are going some place where we can dance and have a good time." 

"Do you really think that's a good idea?" 

"I don't see a problem." 

"Are you considering the message that you will be sending out? A married woman out by herself and letting men come on to her." 

"I won't be alone. Mary and Robin will be with me and you are more than welcome to join us, but I'm not staying home again and watching TV while you go into your home office and work. As far as the message that the wedding rings will send, I can always take them off and leave them here on the dresser if it will make you feel better. How about it?" 

"No, leave them on." 

"Not that silly, I would never take them off and you should know that. I meant would you like to join us?" 

"I can't. I have to revise a couple of sets of specs so I can Fed-Ex them to the supplier." 

"Okay. I have no idea how the night is going to go so don't bother to wait up. The bars close at two so I should be home by three unless the evening is a dud." 

She was just touching up her makeup when a horn honked outside. "That's them, got to go" and she kissed me on the cheek and hurried out of the house. 

I worked on my specifications until around eleven, caught CNN for a bit and then went to bed. I woke up needing to pee around four and Marty was sleeping soundly on the bed next to me. I went into the bathroom and took my whiz and was halfway back to the bed when one of the worst parts of human nature grabbed me. I went back into the bathroom and pulled the clothes that Marty had worn that night out of the dirty clothes hamper and checked them out. I even went so far as to sniff the crotch of her thong, but I found nothing suspicious. Had I really expected to? I told myself no, but something had made me look, hadn't it? 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next morning over coffee and toast I looked Marty over as closely as I dared without being obvious looking for a hickey or some sign that she might have done more than had a few drinks and danced, but I saw nothing. 

That night set the pattern for the next three months. Marty would go out two or three nights a week with her friends and I would look for signs that she was straying, but I never found a thing. The only thing that changed was the frequency of our sex life. For the past year it had been two, sometimes three times a week, but after Marty began going out by herself it increased. Some nights she would wake me up when she got home and sometimes she would wake me up in the morning after one of her outings. One morning I asked her about it. 

"I'm a good looking woman Bill and I get hit on a lot when I'm out. I get felt up on the dance floor and I get a lot of cock poked into my leg and tummy when I'm out there dancing. It makes me horny and when I'm horny I want to make love. Since I assume you don't want me having some one else take care of the problem I bring it home to you." 

That bit of information, instead of putting my mind at ease, made my imagination go into overdrive as I imagined all the things that men could be doing to my wife on the dance floor or sitting in a booth. The more I thought about it the more certain I was that something was going on. It just wasn't natural, to me anyway, to think that a married woman could go out bar hoping two and three nights a week and have nothing sexual happen. The more I thought about it the more irritated it made me and finally that irritation drove me to have a confrontation with Marty over what she was doing. 

She came home on a Saturday night and woke me up by sucking on my cock. When I was awake she swung herself over me to mount me and I twisted away. 

"Leave me alone Marty, I don't want sloppy seconds." 

She froze and for several seconds she didn't move and then, without a word, she got off the bed and left the room and I rolled over and went back to sleep. She wasn't in bed with me when I got up in the morning and she wasn't on the couch. I looked around for her and saw that she was out on the patio sipping coffee. I poured myself a cup and headed for my den to try and get some work done. 

Half an hour later Marty came into the den and sat down. She watched me work for about five minutes without saying a word and then she said, "Is that what you really think? That I'm out there whoring around?" 

"Why else would a married woman spend as many nights a week as you do out running the bars? I know what you told me when you started doing this shit, but two, three and sometimes four times a week? I don't think so. That isn't just a night out with the girls, not by a long shot." 

"That's what you really think and you don't care enough about me to try and stop it?" 

"We've had this conversation Marty and we've done it to death. You know where my head is until this project is over. You are a grown woman and you get to make your own choices. That you can't see that what I'm doing is for us, for our future security, is something that I can't help. When the project is over and I know where I stand financially I'll step back and take a look of what you have left of our marriage and decide whether or not it is worth trying to save." 

"That's it? You have just automatically assumed that I'm a slut and that I'm out there just happily fucking any man who buys me a drink or dances with me and wants some pussy in exchange?" 

"Yeah Marty, I would say that just about covers it." 

"How can you say that - think that- about someone you profess to love?" 

"How can some one who professes to love me go out bar hoping three or four nights a week?" 

"I told you Bill, I just need to get out of the house. I can't stand sitting in front of the TV every night while you disappear into your home office." 

"I can understand the need to get out once in a while Marty, but three and four nights a week isn't just once in a while. Three or four times a week is only a half step from being out there all the time. I also notice that you never go to a movie, to the library, play cards with your friends or do any other activities like that. It is always bars. Places where you can go and, by your own admission, find men to poke their cocks into your leg and feel you up. Just what do you expect all of that to tell me?" 

"I don't know. I just thought that you knew me better than that. For your information, no man other than you has ever had his cock in me and no other man ever will. I do admit to a little hanky-panky and I may have even just slightly crossed the line once, but my pussy, mouth and ass have remained cock free except for yours. I'm sorry that I can't furnish signed affidavits from the men I danced with, but frankly, I never expected to need them." 

"Hanky-panky? What does that mean?" 

"When a guy dances with me and then wants to join me at my table I make it clear to him that I'm married and that I'm only there to have a few drinks, enjoy the music and dance a little - nothing else. But you know as well as I do they are still going to take a shot and try to get lucky. If he is a good dancer, buys me drinks and sees to it that I enjoy myself I don't slap his hands away when they start to roam and I don't fight it if he wants to neck a little. I've been kissed and felt up and I have even gone out to the parking lot and sat in a car with a guy and necked, but I have never been fucked." 

"What did you mean when you said you slightly crossed the line?" 

"In one case, a special one, I let a guy finger fuck me and I gave him a hand job, but that was a one time thing." 

"A special case?" 

"Yeah, Robin's brother. He's had a crush on me for years and he was home on leave just prior to being sent to Iraq. When Robin told me he had a crush on me I thought it was sweet and after watching all the news coming from that godforsaken place I kind of felt bad for him. What if he didn't make it back or what if he came back with missing pieces? Like I said, a special case. I haven't cheated on you Bill." 

"Not yet maybe, but it will happen sooner or later. Some guy won't play by your rules or take no for an answer or someone really smooth will run a game on you and make you think that he is a special case or someone will drop something in your drink. But it will happen Marty; you can't spend that much time in bars and not have it happen." 

"I'm a big girl Bill and I can take care of myself." 

"Yeah Marty, sure you can." 

We didn't talk for a couple of days and then one night Marty came to me, "I'm horny Bill and I can't take this wall that is growing between us. I need my man in bed with me." 

I stood up, "Lead the way." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

For a while Marty cut back on her outings to a Friday or a Saturday night, but after about three weeks she was back up to Friday and Saturday and by six weeks it was three and four nights again. The project deadline was closing in on me and I had made my feelings on the subject crystal clear so I didn't say anything more. And then one night, about three months before the project was due to end I came home and found a note on the kitchen table: 

"Bill, 

I'm sorry, but it just isn't working out between us. 

Good luck on your project. 

Marty" 

I read and reread the note and then I got on the phone and started calling around. Her mother and her sister hadn't heard from her and neither had Mary, Robin or Tina who were the girls she went out with. I came to realize that there wasn't anything that I could do. If Marty wanted to leave I couldn't stop her and if she wanted to get in touch she would. I put her note in the center desk drawer and then buried myself in the project. 

A week went by and I got a phone call from Marty's mother telling me that Marty had called and that she was all right. All she told her mom was that we had differences that couldn't be resolved. Once a week I called Mary, Robin and Tina to see if Marty was around and they always told me that they hadn't seen her. Whether it was true or not I never knew. I didn't hear from any lawyers so I guessed that we were still married although she could have gone to Reno for a quickie and not bothered to tell me. 

After a month or so I gave up thinking about it as the project was coming to an end and it was consuming all my time. I barely noticed the time as the project deadline rushed toward me and then it was all over. We finished three days early and just barely under budget. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, bonus money flowed, and I was promoted into Ron's job when he retired and life slowed down for me. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I still hadn't heard from Marty, but I did check in with her mother from time to time and she always told me that Marty had been in touch and was okay. 

Two weeks after the project ended I made my weekly calls to Mary, Robin and Tina and found out that Marty had shown up at the one of the bars the night before. All she told them was that she had to leave town to take care of some personal problems and that she was glad to be back. I told them to tell her I said hi the next time they saw her and then I hung up. 

When I got home that night Marty's car was in the driveway and when I went into the house I found her sitting at the kitchen table with a half empty bottle of Merlot sitting in front of her. She looked up at me when I came into the room and I couldn't see any emotion on her face, not love, not hate, not pity, not anything. She refilled her glass, poured on for me and pushed it my way. 

"Sit down Billy and let me get this over with so I can get out of here." 

I sat down at the table, picked up the glass and took a sip. 

"You called it Billy. You looked in the old crystal ball, saw it coming and told me just what was going to happen. No way I said to myself, I'm a big girl and I can look out for myself, except that I didn't. It happened just like you said it would. Somebody slipped something in my drink. I found out later that it was two drops of Special K and one tab of Ecstasy. I got fucked that night. I got fucked real good. Seven guys enjoyed Little Miss Marty and they taped it. Marty in glorious living color with a cock in her mouth, a cock in her ass, and a cock in her stupid, "It can't happen to me" pussy. And if that wasn't bad enough I was told that unless I wanted you to see the videotape we were going to do it again and again and again only without the drugs. 

"I couldn't let you see that tape. What it would do to our marriage was certain, especially after you made your little speech, but I couldn't let something like that take your mind off the project, not as close to being done as you were. So, I let myself be blackmailed. Five times over the next two weeks and never less than seven guys. Then one night I told them to fuck off and die; that somehow you had found out and had thrown my ass out of the house and that I was leaving town the next day. And then I told them I would make them a deal. I'd do it one more time in exchange for the tape. They bought it and I spent the next twenty-four hours as the personal slut of eleven guys. 

"When it was over I headed for San Diego where my Aunt Millie lives. I told her I was running away from a marriage gone bad and she let me stay with her. When mom told me that your project was finished I quit the job I had and came back to let you know what happened." 

She finished off her glass of wine and picked her purse up off the floor and set it on the table. 

"I think I know you pretty well Billy and even now I can see it in your eyes. You are going to say "We all make mistakes, but we can work it out. There isn't anything that we can't overcome as long as we love each other." You would be wrong Billy. The thing is, I liked it. I liked having six or seven guys trying to fuck me to death. I even did it a couple of times when I was in California. Actually, it was more like once a week. San Diego is full of horny sex starved sailors and Marines and I tried to be patriotic and help them out. 

"Anyway, to make sure that you realize what a slut I've become I've brought you the tape. I was drugged to get me going, but I think that you will see my natural enthusiasm shine through. I'm sorry Billy, I really am. I should have listened to you but I didn't and now I'm paying the price." 

She got up and headed for the door, leaving the tape sitting in the center of the table, and when she got to the door she stopped and turned, "I love you Billy. I always have and I'm sorry that I did this to us" and then she was out the door and gone. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Her enthusiasm did indeed show through and that tape put every professionally done porn tape I'd ever seen to shame. Marty did it all, or they did it all to Marty, depending on your point of view, and I confess to having beat my meat four times by the end of the tape. That night I didn't get much sleep and it wasn't because of the tape; it was because of my feelings for Marty. I loved the stupid bitch and I really didn't want my marriage to her to end, but I honestly didn't see how it could survive. I could buy the drugged part and the blackmail that followed, but how was I supposed to get past the "I liked it" - liked it so much that she continued doing it in California? 

I woke up the next morning with no better idea of what to do than I'd had when I went to bed. The day at work was a wasted day because all I could think of was Marty. What it came down to was that Marty and I needed to talk. She was in the third bar that I hit, sitting in a booth with four guys and I walked over to them. 

"Marty, we nee...." And one of the guys in the booth said, "Take a number asshole, the bitch is with us." 

I grabbed him by his long hair, jerked him out of the booth and dumped him on the floor. I kicked him hard in the ribs and then looked down at him, "I'll just take your number sperm breath and if you ever call my wife a bitch again I'll stomp your head into jelly and if you come up off that floor any way but peaceful I'll do it anyway."  

===

I turned back to the booth and said, "There is a table over there where we can talk" and I held out my hand. She took it and I helped her out of the booth and walked her to the table and we sat down. 

"It looks like I interrupted your evening." 

"No, I may have become a slut, but I'm a selective slut. That bunch wasn't going to get anything but a dance or two and the privilege of buying me drinks. What brings you here?" 

"You. Us. You dumped your bomb on me and then got up and left, but you didn't say a word about what happens next." 

"I thought that was self-evident. You watched the tape?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"What else needs to be said? You could never live with the woman on that tape. That's me Bill. The new me - the real me. I didn't say anything because I knew that once you saw that tape and the fact that I told you that I liked doing it hit home your next move would be to call the lawyers." 

"That wasn't one of the things that I thought. My first thought was how could we go about salvaging enough out of this mess to keep us together. Next came "Be serious Bill, no way you can live with what she's done" and that was followed by "You have to try. You love her to damned much not to try." I love you Marty. I know that there have been times during the past year that you questioned that, but it is true. I can't give up on you, on us, without trying everything in my power to keep us together." 

"I'm glad that you feel that way honey, but it won't work. You just aren't the kind of guy who can sit home and wait for me to come home knowing what it is that I'm out doing. You aren't the kind of guy who can watch or participate so what does that leave us?" 

I started to say something, but Marty held up her hand, "Let me finish baby. What I'm saying is that I WILL do it again. I know me a lot better now, and I know that a week from now, a month from now or a year from now I'll be on my back trying to get six, ten or fifteen guys to fuck me senseless. I could say, "Thank God you love me enough to let me back in your life and I'll make it up to you, I promise, and I'll be a good girl from now on." And I would mean it Billy, I really would." 

"But?" 

"No Billy, I would really mean it and I would try hard baby, I would try really really hard, but I know as sure that the two of us are sitting here that one night you would come home from work and find a note on the kitchen table telling you I was going out with the girls and to not wait up. And what would happen when I came home? You pushed me away once when I hadn't even done anything saying that you weren't going to take any sloppy seconds. Has your position changed? Do you honestly think that you could follow seven or eight guys into me? Or it could be even worse; you could come home to find that I haven't even left the house to do it. 

"No Billy, it wouldn't work. I'll always love you and I will always treasure the fact that at one time you loved me, but it just won't work." 

"We have to try Marty. Even if it does turn out the way you say it will, we still have to try." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

We did try. Marty went home with me that night and I tried to make up for three months of going without. We made love more times that night than at any other time in our marriage. It was sick of me, but every time I thought that I couldn't get it up again I thought of Marty's video and I'd rise to the occasion. That tape drove our sex life although Marty never knew it. She thought that I had destroyed the tape and she wasn't aware that I watched it whenever she wasn't around. 

One night she asked me what had come over me, "Are you eating Viagra by the handful?" 

I think that in the back of her mind she knew what was going on - I was doing my best to keep her from going out and looking for a half a dozen other guys. 

Nine months went by and just as I began to think we were okay I came home to find what she had said I'd find someday - a note on the kitchen table: 

Sweetie, 

I've gone out to have a drink with Robin and Mary. Dinner 

is in the microwave. Set it for two minutes. I may be late 

so don't wait up. Love you 

Marty 

I was torn between waiting up for her and finding out for sure or going to sleep so I wouldn't see her when she came home. I convinced myself that if I didn't see evidence of her being gangfucked I could make myself believe that all she did was go out for a drink with the girls. 

She was asleep next to me when I got up the next morning and I got up and left the room without looking for any sign of what she might have done. She was still asleep when I left for work. When I got home that night dinner was ready and Marty was her usual cheerful self. Neither one of us mentioned the previous night and that night when we went to bed we did our best to destroy each other sexually. 

Three months went by before it happened again and again nothing was said by either of us the next day. As long as it didn't come up I could force myself to believe it was just drinks with Mary and Robin. Then the intervals got shorter: Two months, then six weeks, a month and then every two weeks and finally it was every Friday and I could no longer delude myself about what Marty was doing. She might be starting her evening with the girls, but she was ending it with the boys. 

I should have left well enough alone. Our sex life was fantastic and there was no doubt that we loved each other, but for some perverse reason I just couldn't leave it that way. One Friday night I waited up for Marty. She was surprised to see me and I detected a touch of sadness crossing her face. She knew, even if I didn't - at least at the time - that I had just put the kiss of death on our relationship. 

"Hi baby. Finally decide to have some sloppy seconds? Well come on lover, let's get to bed and I'll fuck your eyes out." 

She was wet, sloppy and loose and I wondered how many had beaten me into her that night. It was as if she had read my mind. 

"How does it feel baby? Think you could learn to like it. There were nine tonight lover. Two spics, three niggers and the rest were white guys. I am an equal opportunity slut baby. Cocks have no color as far as I am concerned. Does it make you hot baby? Does it turn you on to know that black cocks have emptied into me? That Mexicans have put their own type of salsa in me? Come on baby, fuck me hard. Make me cum honey, show me that you love your whorish slut." 

I wouldn't have believed it possible, but I fucked her four times that night and listening to her sluttish talk made me cum harder than I ever had before. For the next six weeks I'd wait up for Marty on her Friday nights or she would wake me up when she got home. I can't even begin to describe what was going on in my head at the time. I was disgusted with myself for enjoying Marty's well used pussy, but I gloried in being married to my own personal sex goddess. Six days a week she was a loving an attentive wife and every Friday she became a whorish slut, but she was my whorish slut! 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Once again I couldn't leave well enough alone. I had to take the next step in the natural progression that had started on that first night. 

"No baby, it isn't a good idea." 

"Why not? God knows I wallow in what you bring home." 

"That's not the same baby. There is a big difference between knowing, feeling and actually seeing it happen. Please honey, trust me on this, it is a bad idea." 

"You don't understand Marty. I need to see it and after I see it I may even want to participate." 

"Honey, I'm not the same woman you know when a group of men fuck me. I say things and I do things when I'm in a sexual frenzy, things that will bother you. I won't mean what I say, but my lovers will be pushing buttons and getting me to say things that they want to hear; things that you won't want to hear. You might never want to kiss me again after you see some of the things I do with my mouth. Please honey, things are good between us right now, let it be." 

But I wouldn't and finally she said, "Okay, but If we do it we do it the way I say." 

That Friday found us in the parking lot of one of her favorite bars. "You sit here in the car until I come out. It may be an hour or two, but be patient. Nothing is going to happen if I have you with me." 

An hour and a half later she came out with eight guys who split up and headed for their cars. Marty got in and said, "Follow that Chevy pick up." We drove in silence until we got to a Motel 6 and as we pulled onto the lot Marty said, "Honest honey, it will be best if you just let me out and go on home." 

"I'm here Marty. I've come this far, I'll go the rest of the way." 

The guy in the Chevy went into the office and came out several minutes later waving a key. He went to room 124 and guys started climbing out of their cars and following him. Marty looked at me and said, "Please baby, remember that I love you and that whatever happens when they get me flying doesn't mean a thing" 

She looked at me one last time hoping that I would let her out and then go home and when I didn't she shrugged and said, "Okay, let's do it." 

It started out bad. When we walked into the room one of the guys looked at me and said, "Who's he?" 

"My husband." 

"What's he doing here?" 

"Whatever he wants." 

The guy looked over at me, "Come to see a couple of real men fuck her?" 

A black guy piped up, "You come for lessons in how to take care of her?"" 

Another guy said, "He must need them real bad or she wouldn't be out looking for the likes of us." 

"He doesn't come across as a wimp at first glance, but he must be one. Why else would he stand by and let other guys fuck his old lady." 

Marty spoke up, "Hey, what did we come here for, to talk or to fuck. Tony, put on the boom box." 

I read a couple of faces and they were saying, "Need your old lady to bail you out, to take the heat off of you?" 

The black guy must have been Tony because he picked up a boom box and turned it on. Music began to play and Marty began to do a strip tease and as her clothes came off the men in the room were trash talking and aiming it at me. 

"She is one hot bitch, it would take a real man to keep her happy." 

"Maybe it's a dick size thing. Maybe he wants to keep her happy, but just doesn't pack the gear." 

There were several other comments and I was starting to get steamed. With eight of them there I was going to get my ass stomped, but I had just about had it with the wimp shit. Marty was naked by then, except for her high heels and as she swayed to the music she said, "John, you paid for the room so you go first. How do you want it?" 

"Suck my cock and then I want that tight ass of yours." 

Marty sank to her knees and said, "Bring it to me lover." 

All talking stopped and all eyes were on Marty as she wrapped her lips around John's cock and went to work on him. Her hands came up to caress his balls and one guy said, "Jesus, I wish my wife could suck cock like that" and another guy said, "She does, at least for me" and everybody laughed while the first guy turned red. To deflect attention away from him he turned to me, "You suck a lot of cock?" 

I felt the anger build up and he saw in my face that he was about to get fucked over big time so he tried to back off. 

"By proxy I mean. You eat her out when she comes home from being with us?" 

I made the mistake of backing off a little so he went charging ahead again. 

"A real man would eat her out. If he could let her fuck around like you do he should be able to show her he loves her by chowing down on her beaver when it is full of cream." 

Before I could say anything Marty finished sucking on John's cock and got up on the bed. She got on her knees and buried her head in a pillow and John moved in behind her and began easing his cock into her ass while she moaned into the pillow. Once John was buried to the hilt in Marty and he started fucking her whatever the assholes were saying didn't come through to me. All my attention was on Marty as one man after another used one of her holes. Marty screamed, she cried and she begged them to fuck her harder, to fuck her faster, and to make her cum. 

I was the only man in the room who hadn't fucked her; some of them were on there second time and one was in her for the third time. I was sitting there, my palms sweating, wishing I had a video camera when things really went bad. 

Tony was buried in her pussy, her long legs up on his shoulders and he looked over at me when he said, "You like this cock baby?" 

"Oh yes, I love your cock." 

"You like my big black stick more that you like your wimp hubby's dick?" 

"Yes lover, you're much better, fuck me baby, fuck me hard." 

"Your hubby is a wimp isn't he?" 

'Yes baby, a wimp. Push it in lover, push it in deep and fuck me." 

"He can't fuck you as good as I can, can he?" 

"Nobody fucks me as good as you baby, keep doing it baby, keep fucking me, I'm almost there baby, bring me over." 

"Want the wimp to come over and finish you off?" 

"No" she cried, "Don't stop, don't stop now, you do it, I'm almost there baby, don't stop." 

"What's the matter? Isn't the wimp any good in bed?" 

"Not like you baby, bring me over, make me cum, make me cum." 

"Everybody in this room can fuck you better than he can, can't they?" 

"Oh yes, oh god yes, don't stop, don't stop, I'm almost there, get me there baby, get me there.' 

"Not while he watches. Tell him to leave. Tell him you need real men fucking you. Tell him you have no time for wimps." 

"Please baby, don't tease me, get me there get me off." 

"Tell him to leave." 

"Oh god, leave Billy, go home so they can fuck me." 

"He needs to leave because he's a wimp, isn't that right." 

"Yes, a wimp, he's a wimp, he can't fuck me like you can. Go home Billy, go home so they can fuck meeeeeeeee" she c screamed as she had her orgasm. 

Tony pulled out of her with a smirk on his face and said, "Next." 

The rest of them had seen the game he was playing and it must have looked like fun because the next guy stepped up and said, "Where do you want it sweetie?" 

Marty was down from her orgasm yet and she said, "I don't care, just put it in and fuck me." 

"Not until you tell the wimp to leave." 

"For gods sake Billy, go home, leave, take your wimpy ass and get out of here so I can get fucked." 

John laughed and said, "So you can be fucked by real men, right?" 

"Yes real men, need to be fucked by real men, not wimps, real men, come on and fuck me" she screamed as he shoved his cock into her with one hard push. "Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, fuck me, fuck me hard." 

"I can't fuck you, the wimp is still here." 

"God damn it Billy, go home. Get the fuck out of here, I need cock, real cock, go home Billy, get out of here and go the fuck home." 

Suddenly it was as if a light had been turned on illuminating everything. Why hadn't I seen it before? It was al so clear now. I was a wimp! That was the real reason I couldn't keep my wife at home, keep her faithful to me; I just wasn't man enough. Would a real man let his wife do what I had been letting Marty do? No he wouldn't. Would a real man have gone after her and tried to get her to come home after seeing that video of her and hearing her say she liked it? Again, no, and no to the question "Would a real man wallow in his wife's cunt after she had been gangbanged? In that instant I realized that everything that these men had been saying and thinking was true. I really wasn't much of a man; I'd let Marty turn me into a wimp. 

I got up and headed for the door and John sniggered, "If you needed proof guys, there it is. A real man would fight for his woman." 

I was already in the car when Marty came running out of the motel room yelling, "Wait Billy, wait." 

She came running across the parking lot dressed in only a shirt belonging to one of the guys. She opened the passenger door and slid in, "Where are you going?" 

"To the house." 

"You are just going to leave me here?" 

"It's your party, I'm just a wet n blanket. Go have your fun. I'm sure that one of them will give you a ride home when it's over. Now go. You have cum running out of your cunt and I don't want it to stain the seat covers." 

We might have managed to make a go of it - only might - if she had said, "No Bill, I came with you so I'll leave with you, but she didn't. What she said was, "Well, okay" and she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek and told me she would see me when she got home and then she got out of the car and went back into the motel room. 

I tried going to bed to sleep when I got home, but I was just too keyed up. I was wide awake staring up at the ceiling when I heard a car pull into the drive. When Marty still wasn't in the house five minutes later I got up and looked out the window. I saw kicking legs in the window and I turned and got back into bed. Marty had gotten a ride home and now she was giving her ride a ride. 

When she did finally come in she got into bed with me and her hand went straight to my cock, but I reached down and pushed it away. 

"Come on honey, don't be that way. Don't ever think that I think you are a wimp." 

"Unfortunately Marty, that is just what I do think." 

"Those guys were assholes honey, testosterone laden assholes and nothing they said should have bothered you." 

"It wasn't what they said Marty, it was what you said." 

"I warned you before we went that I would say things I didn't mean once they got me fired up." 

"Yeah, you did, and I could see you saying all those things if they wanted you to when I'm not there, but I was in the room Marty. I was there and you knew I was there. You weren't so far out in a sexual fog that you couldn't remember things. You never forgot anyone's name, not even mine. "Fuck me hard Tony", "My ass Steve, I want you in my ass", "Oh yeah Dave, like that." No Marty, you could not have said those things about me unless somewhere in the back of your mind you really thought them. They were there and in your sexual frenzy you relaxed the lock on the compartment you had them in and they all came out." 

"You can't really think that." 

"Oh I do Marty, I do indeed. I'm not saying that you don't love me, at least in your own way, but you do think that I'm a wimp for letting you do what you do; for just sitting back and letting you hang horns on me week after week." 

"You're wrong Bill, I don't think of you that way." 

"Of course you do, and you are right. I'm not much of a man if I can sit back and let you do your thing. It took the guys in that room to wake me up to the fact that I really am a wimp and not much of a man where you are concerned. All of a sudden Marty, I don't much like me." 

"Honey you are so wrong. I love you baby, you are the only man for me." 

"Sure you love me Marty, and why not? I let you do whatever you want and say nothing. What woman wouldn't want a man like that? No Marty, what you really think of me came through loud and clear tonight in that motel room and don't waste your breath in trying to deny it because I wouldn't believe you anyway. You can tell me that what you said was just bullshit and was said to please those assholes fucking you, but one of the strongest human emotions is anger. Anger cuts through weaker emotions and anger would have sliced right through that sexual fog you say you were in. When you said what you said about me you were angry Marty, very angry. There was no way that you could have yelled at me, "Take your wimpy ass and get out of here" and not know what you were saying." 

"That's not true baby. You've got it all wrong." 

"You came out of your sexual fog pretty damned quick when you though I was leaving you there. When I got up and left you had to know what I was thinking, what was going on in my mind. But did you grab your clothes and your purse and come after me? No Marty, all you were worried about was your ride home. If you really gave a shit about me you would never have gone back into that motel room and let me leave feeling the way that I did."  

===

I stared at her for a couple of moments and then I said, "One more thing. I know that this is irrational as hell, but for some strange reason I never looked on your gangbangs as you cheating on me, but when you fucked whoever it was who brought you home tonight in our own driveway that to me was cheating. The bottom line Marty - leave me alone. I'll pack in the morning and be out of here by noon." 

"Billy please, don't do this to me." 

"I'm not doing anything to you Marty except cutting you loose to do whatever you want. No Marty, I'm not doing anything to you. Whatever I've done I've done to me." 

She started crying so I got up and left the bedroom and spent the rest of the night on the couch. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Packing to leave was a chore and a half as Marty begged and pleaded with me not to go. I was finally able to get packed and out of the house and checked into a motel. It took me a couple of days to find an apartment and I moved in and got on with my life. Marty wouldn't give up. She told me that she wouldn't give me a divorce and I told her that if I wanted one she couldn't stop me because I still had the tape she had given me way back when. "It is all the grounds I'll need." Besides, getting married again wasn't high on my list of priorities so it didn't matter to me if I got divorced or not. 

Months went by with Marty constantly calling me and telling me to come home where I belonged and I kept telling her no, that there wasn't anything there for me anymore. I was a healthy male and I still had a sexual appetite and so I headed out and became one of those guys who made the bar scene. I had a lot of trouble at first because most of the women I came in contact with knew I was Marty's husband. Once the word got around that I'd left her things got better and I started to score. Marty got pissed when she found out and I had to smile. She could fuck guys six or ten at a time, but I was a rotten bastard for fucking just one. 

Several times we ran across each other as we hit the bars and as soon as I saw her I left and went to another. Along the way I managed to bed Mary, Tina and Robin which absolutely infuriated Marty and she went after them. They laughed at her and told her, "Hey, you're the one who let him get away." 

Marty took to following me from bar to bar to try and break up any action I might get going and one night she slid into a booth across from me. 

"How about this? If you won't come home to me maybe we can just do the bar game. Whenever we find each other in the same bar you can take me out to the car and fuck me a couple of times like the other girls you pick up and we both win. You save time and the money you would have spent on the bitch, get your rocks off and I at least get that much of you. It isn't what I want, but I'll take what I can get." 

"Sorry Marty, but you are just a little too promiscuous. I don't why I never thought of it before, but you fuck way to many different men way too often. Sooner or later one of them is going to lay a social disease on you and I'm not all that keen on having you pass it on to me. I at least use condoms with the ladies I'm playing with, but I remember that sloppy swamp you used to bring home and that one gangbang I attended I didn't see even one rubber used. No Marty, if you don't already have something it won't be long before you do." 

"That was cold." 

"No colder than what you laid on me." 

"Damn it Billy, I want you. I need you honey, please come home." 

"Thanks but no thanks Marty" I said as I got up from the bar and went looking for some other place. 

Six months went by and a lot happened. Robin and I took a liking to each other and she moved in with me which pissed off Marty to no end. I ran into Tony one night and he sneered at me and said, "Hey, if it ain't the wimp." He was sitting at a table with three other guys and I walked over to him and bent down. My face was three inches from his when I said, "I'm going to go outside and stand by my car nigger. Why don't you come out and join me and find out what kind of game the wimp has." I went outside and waited for ten minutes and he never came out. 

Maybe a month after that Robin and I were having lunch when John and two others who had been at Marty's gangbang came in, saw us and headed for our table. I balled my fists and started to stand up and John held up his hands, "Whoa dude, I come in peace. Can we sit?" I nodded and the three sat down. 

"We owe you an apology man. I know it won't cut no ice with you now, but what we did that night wasn't aimed at you, it was aimed at Marty. We was always ragging on her about why a married woman had to go out to get laid. We used to tell her she needed to leave her worthless husband and find someone who could really take care of her and she would get pissed off and tell us that you were more of a man than all of us put together. We just laughed at her and asked her if that was the case what was she doing with us. She laughed right back and said, "He's only one man. There are seven of you here tonight and you can't satisfy me so why would you think only one man could. I'm here to save his life. If I stayed home he'd be in his grave in a month. 

"All we was doing that night was trying to wind her watch. She didn't mean a word of it man. We get her going and we can get her to say anything. One night we got her to say she would suck off a pony for us. Anyway, just wanted you to know that" and he went to get up but then stopped. "By the way, she didn't put us up to this. She hasn't had anything to do with any of us since that night. She blames us for breaking you two up. I'm sorry man, I'm really sorry." 

When they were gone Robin said, "You aren't buying any of that bullshit, are you?" 

"Why not?" 

"That 'my husband is more of a man than all of you' is just so much shit. Did you know that she fucked my brother? Told him that as young as he was he was still more of a man than her husband." 

"She told me that she gave him a hand job." 

"Oh please. She took him to the Motel 6 and fucked his brains out. The poor kid left for Iraq convinced that when he got home she was going to leave you for him." 

"I thought that you were her friend?" 

"I was and I still could be if she would just admit to herself that I didn't steal you away from her; that she threw you away and I got lucky and caught you on the rebound." 

"She actually took your brother to a motel?" 

"That's what he told me." 

"Maybe he was being just a little less than honest. Maybe he was just puffing it up to make him look like a stud." 

"I believe him. It was what she was doing with everyone else." 

"Everyone else?" 

"Oh come on sweetie, you had to know. As far as I know my brother was the only one she fucked, but she was decorating backseats and handing out blow jobs and hand jobs like party favors. I can't honestly remember a night that we went out together that some guy didn't get lucky." 

I didn't know whether to believe her or not. She could have been lying to me to poison me against having thoughts about getting back together with Marty, but then it didn't really matter because as far as I was concerned Marty was a dead issue. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Marty dropped out of sight for about six months and no one seemed to know where she was or have any idea of what had happened to her. One Tuesday afternoon my secretary buzzed me and told me that my wife was there to see me. And I told her to show Marty in and when Marty had taken a seat I asked her what she wanted. 

"I'm here to beg, crawl or do whatever I have to do to get you to come home to me." 

"We've already been over this ground Marty." 

"There have been some changes since we last talked." 

She opened her purse and handed me an envelope. 

"I've not been with a man in over seven months. Those are the monthly tests, last one dated yesterday, that show I'm disease free. Billy, I'm begging you. My life sucks without you. I'm not sleeping, I've got no appetite, and I'm just plain miserable without you. Please Bill, I'll do anything, whatever you want, just come home." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++= 

Robin took it well. Told me that if things didn't work out and she was still unattached to give her a call. She and Marty are back on speaking terms, but I seriously doubt that their friendship will ever get back to where it was. 

It has been almost a year now and Marty has done her best to spoil me rotten. I come home every night hoping that I won't find a note on the kitchen table and dinner in the microwave. Marty knows that she hasn't gotten my trust back yet and I think that she may be aware that she might never get it. I love her so I'm praying that we make it, but I'm still just taking it one day at a time. Report_Story
