#1 

===

When I was younger, fifteen or so, I was present when my mom and dad had one hell of an argument which ended with my mom throwing an ashtray at dad and then stomping out of the room. That wasn't the first time that mom had gotten violent with dad and when she was out of the room I asked him why he put up with it. He thought for a minute and then he said: 

"Life is full of ups and downs Rob. You have to learn to take the bad with the good and then hope that in the end the good outweighs the bad. Your momma can be a trial at times, but her good qualities outweigh her bad ones and that's the best I can hope for." 

My life was indeed full of ups and downs, but I was forty-four before I got to where the good outweighed the bad. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I had gone to work for the XYZ Corporation right out of college and in fourteen years I had worked my way up the corporate ladder to become the Vice President of Production. Two months after starting at XYZ I met Lois at the company picnic. She was a secretary in the sales department and I took a shine to her and started pestering her for a date. She finally gave in, we clicked and six months later we were married. 

The marriage was followed by two children, a boy and a girl, a three-bedroom house and two cars. In short, a typical middle class life. I had only been married to Lois a year before the truism that men tend to marry their mothers became apparent. Lois was insanely jealous and had a violent temper. If we were at the mall or in some store and some babe walked by and I even looked in her direction Lois would have a fit. 

At company Christmas parties, where it was expected that you would do a courtesy dance with the other women at the table, Lois would rag on me because I danced too close with this one or seemed to chummy with that one. I would come back from the dance floor and sit down and she would kick my leg under the table and glare at me. 

Once when I was dancing with the wife of the CEO she maneuvered me under the mistletoe and said: 

"I told my husband I was going after a younger man tonight and he laughed at me" and then she kissed me. 

I glanced over at our table and saw her husband grinning and Lois fuming. When I got back to the table Lois said she would like a breath of fresh air and so I walked her outside. As soon as the door closed behind us she turned and slapped my face and called me every name in the book for "What you did with that tramp." 

At home an argument would usually end up with something thrown at me, usually not heavy, and she almost never hit me with the item. I never knew if it was because her aim was bad or if maybe it was exceptionally good. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The next to worst spot in our marriage was when she decided that I was having an affair with my secretary. Granted, Molly and I did spend a lot of time together, but it was because of the job. And yes, we did have lunch together a lot, but for the most part they were working lunches. Twice Molly went on overnight out of town business trips with me and both times we had separate rooms on different floors, but Lois was convinced I was bedding Molly. 

I wouldn't have minded - Molly was a fox - but I just wasn't the type of guy who played around on his wife. Lois made snide remarks about Molly all the time and I got the third degree every time I came home from work late, which was a lot. Being a vice president was not a nine to five job. Many mornings I would be out of the house at six and a lot of evenings I didn't get home until eight or nine and I would be greeted with: 

"You've been out with that bitch again, haven't you!" 

She went through my pockets, I caught her going through my briefcase, and once I even saw her sniffing my clothes. It came to a head one day when I told Lois I would be working late that night. 

"Yeah, and I bet I know just who you will be working on." 

I just shook my head and said, "Grow up Lois, you need to get a grip on yourself." 

At ten that morning one of the managers I know pretty well came into my office: 

"Rob, you old dog you, where do you have your mistress stashed?" 

"What the hell are you talking about John? That doesn't make any sense." 

"Well it must be something like that. Why else would your wife be following you?" 

"What the hell are you talking about?" 

"Lois is sitting across the street in the department store parking lot and she's watching this building. Obviously she plans on following you to your lunch time tryst." 

I got up and went across the seventh floor to John's office and looked out the window and sure enough, there was Lois sitting in her sister's car watching our building. 

"What are you going to do?" John asked. 

"What I ought to do is go down there, pull her out of that car and put her across my knee and spank her, but I think what I will do is tweak her nose a little." 

At eleven forty-five a man in an apron and wearing a shirt that had Aaron's Deli embroidered over the pocket walked up to the car and knocked on the window of the car Lois was sitting in. She rolled the window down and he handed her the bagged lunch that I had ordered. She said something and he pointed up at the window where I and several of my coworkers were watching. When Lois looked up I waved at her and then I went back to my office and got back to work. What I didn't know until later was that John had clued in a bunch of people and they were all standing in front of the building watching. After Lois had looked up at me and I had waved she had thrown the lunch to the ground, started up the car and began to pull out of the lot. She saw the crowd of people standing there waving at her and laughing and she burned rubber tearing off down the street. 

That night when I got home I was greeted by a wine bottle being thrown at me that missed and smashed into the wall followed by: 

"You bastard! How could you do that to me? Do you have any idea how much you embarrassed me?" 

"Probably not nearly as much as I was when the people I work with came to me and told me you were spying on me." 

Things were a bit cold around the house for several days after that. The question could be asked: 

"Why do you put up with that shit?" 

It all goes back to what my dad had said to me about having to take the bad with the good. Lois was a great cook, she kept a clean house, she did a fantastic job raising our kids and she was marvelous - absolutely marvelous - in bed. So, hands down, the good far outweighed the bad. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The worse thing to happen to our marriage occurred about six months after the spying incident. XYZ became the target of a hostile takeover and when the dust settled we were owned by Titan, a large conglomerate. Everybody knows what happens after a hostile takeover and almost all of us at XYZ were sweating our jobs. The big question on everyone's mind was who would they keep and who would they let go. First to go of course was the president and CEO and he was replaced by a woman who quickly gained the nickname, "Harriet, the Hatchet Lady." Empty desks began to appear all over the place as one by one people were called into Harriet's office only to leave looking dejected. 

My turn to be summoned came two weeks after Harriet arrived. I came into her office and she motioned me toward a chair while she continued reading from a folder that I assumed was my personnel file. She put the folder down, looked at me and said: 

"You have been with the company fifteen years?" 

I nodded a yes. 

"There isn't a bad report in the file on you. Nothing but "excellent" and "superior" on your performance reviews, and you have worked almost all the positions in the production department. You know it inside and out. How much trouble would it be for someone else to come in here and take your place?" 

"They would have a rough go of it for three or four months. I'm not irreplaceable if that is what you are getting at." 

She looked at me for several seconds and then said, "I expected you to try and tell me that the production department would quickly go to hell without you to run it." 

"Why would I say that? You don't get to be in the position that you are in if you are stupid. You know the place ran find before I was made VP and it would have run fine after I left. Assuming of course that I broke in my replacement the way I was broken in. But as I said, throw an experienced production man in the job and give him three or four months and he'll be okay. I won't lie to you; in those three or four months production will go to hell, but it will eventually straighten out." 

"So you are saying the place would go to hell without you." 

"No, not at all. Unless I had the time to train my replacement and teach him what I know there would be disruptions. He, or she for that matter, would have no idea of what special relationships exist between us and our suppliers and customers. They would have no idea of who needs to be stroked or how. Not knowing those things could cause you to lose customers or have a supplier cut out his discounts to you. Every new man comes in thinking he can change things for the better, and maybe he can, but not knowing the men, the machinery or the process can cause him to make major blunders. Eventually you would recover, but for a while things would not go right and when production is off sales are impacted and it just snow balls from there." 

She studied me for a moment and then picked up the folder again. While she was looking at it I was looking at her. She was in her late thirties I guessed and had a very attractive face. In fact, I thought, it could be a very beautiful face if she wanted it to be. It looked to me like she went out of her way to make herself look severe. Was she afraid she wouldn't be taken seriously if she were seen as good looking? I wondered what kind of body her severely tailored business attire hid. She put the file down. 

"Do you have any idea how hard it would be for you to ever get back up to the level where you are now if we were to let you go? Most companies wouldn't hire a man your age for a position like yours. They prefer young men with fresh ideas who can grow with the company. Oh I've no doubt you could get on somewhere as a supervisor or a manager, but by the time you worked your way back up to where you would be promotable to a VP slot you would be too old and they would be looking for someone younger. You do understand that, right?" 

All I could do was nod a yes. 

"Two kids in college and a mortgage take a pretty hefty chunk of your income, right?" 

Again all I could do was nod a yes. 

"I'll give it to you straight. My gut feeling is to let you go and I called you in here to do just that, but now I'm not sure that I want to. Doesn't mean that I won't, but I'm reconsidering. Want to know why?" 

"Yes, I believe I would." 

"I'm a pretty good judge of people and I read them well. You are a dedicated family man who loves his family and wants the best for them. But a minute ago while I was reading your file I saw you looking at me and wondering what I look like under this business suit. That is what is making me reconsider. I'm not married, but that doesn't mean that I don't like men or that I just haven't found the right one yet. Early on I decided that I wanted to be where I am right now and I knew that to get here I couldn't allow myself to be distracted by a husband or children. But I am a woman with a woman's needs. Can you understand that?" 

I had no idea what she was getting at so all I could do was nod another yes and hope that was what she was looking for. 

"What I am going to say next is between you and me and if you try to go public with it I will deny it and say it is just sour grapes from some one I let go. It will be a he said/she said situation and it would gain you nothing. In fact all it will do is make it harder for you to find another job. No one is going to want a whistle blower working for them. I'm going to make you an offer and I need a decision before you leave this office. I need someone discrete that I can have uncomplicated sex with. Sex with no emotional involvement. You would be ideal. Your position in the company is such that no one will think twice about the amount of time we spend together and because of your wife and family you would want to keep it quiet and well hidden. Here's the deal - you become my lover and you keep your job, you don't and you don't." 

To say I was stunned would be a major understatement. Never in my wildest imagination could I have ever conceived of that. To keep my job I had to fuck my boss! My mind was in a whirl. In over twenty years of marriage to Lois I had never been unfaithful and I had always considered that I was not the kind of man who ever could or would. If I lost the job I wouldn't be able to keep the kids in school, I probably wouldn't be able to keep the house and I knew she was dead on about my job prospects at my age. 

What the hell do you do? You have all those thoughts bouncing around in your head and you have to make a decision in just minutes. She sat across the desk from me and looked at me: 

"Well? What is it going to be?" 

Could I do it? If I did could I hide it from Lois? As jealous as she was she was always looking for signs that I was straying. Shit! I needed the job. I probably wasn't thinking all that clearly, but I couldn't any way to take care of my family if I didn't do what Harriet wanted. I didn't want to; I swear to God I didn't want to, but I guess my character wasn't as strong as I had always thought it was. 

"Well? I need an answer. In or out?" 

I took a deep breath and said, "In." 

She got up from behind her desk and walked over and locked her office door. She walked back to the front of her desk, lifted her skirt to show me she had no panties covering her bald cunt and then she sat down on the edge of the desk and spread her legs wide. 

"To seal our bargain why don't you come over here and show me how good you are at eating pussy." 

I sat there in my chair and stared at her pussy and she said, "Come on baby, it won't bite. It just wants to meet you." 

I got up from my chair and went over to her and got down on my knees, took a deep breath and leaned forward to save my job. She only kept me at it for a minute or so, just long enough to show me who was in charge and then she pushed me away: 

"That's enough for now." 

As she straightened her skirt she said, "We will be flying to Chicago next Tuesday to meet with McPhearson to discuss contract renewal. I'll arrange adjoining rooms. Save some energy, you will need it." 

I felt guilty as hell when I went home that night and Lois sensed it and asked me what was wrong. 

"Nothing I can do anything about. I'm worried about keeping my job now that we have been taken over and the new owners are reorganizing and eliminating duplication." 

"Is there any chance you will be let go?" 

"A pretty good one." 

"Oh Jesus Rob, what will we do?" 

"Start looking for ways to cut back on expenses for a start." 

"Will we have to sell the house?" 

"Let's not worry about that now. Let's wait and see what happens." 

"When will you know?" 

I'll never know until the day they cut me loose." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Tuesday we flew to Chicago, checked in at our hotel and went up to our rooms. 

"Unlock the connecting door" Harriet said as we put our keys in the doors. Once inside I put my suitcase on the bed and unlocked the door. I started to unpack and five minutes later the door opened and a very naked Harriet walked into my room. 

"I expected you to be undressed." 

"I thought we had to go see McPhearson." 

"Not for another two hours. Come on, you're wasting time." 

Once I was undressed she said, "I don't need foreplay. What I do need right now is an energetic fuck." 

She got on my bed, spread her legs and waited for me. She was a bitch, but she was a goddamned good-looking bitch. She was the first naked woman I'd seen since Lois and I got married and as much as I despised her my cock still reacted. 

"Well come on" she said impatiently and I moved onto the bed with her. I moved between her legs and she took hold of my cock and lined it up with her pussy and I pushed hard. I had hoped that with no foreplay I could at least make her flinch and thereby get some satisfaction at fucking over her, but she was wet, extremely wet, and I slid right in. 

"Oh yeah, oh shit yeah" she moaned as I started humping. "Fast baby, fast and hard, I need this one. Put my legs up on your shoulders baby, I want you in deep." 

I did what she told me and then I fucked her as hard and as fast as I could. She was tight and she knew how to work her cunt muscles so it felt like her pussy was clutching at my cock and I knew that I wasn't going to last long. A chance to fuck over her I thought. I'll come and leave the bitch hanging, but even as I had that thought she screamed: 

"I'm cumming, oh god oh god oh god, oh yes I'm cummingggggg..." and I felt her body tense up and a sudden warmth surround my cock as she came. Damn! The bitch was a squirter. I'd known one in college. If my cock hadn't acted like a plug her cum would have flooded out of her cunt like she was pissing. I felt her cunt squeeze my cock and I ejaculated into her. When I pulled out she looked at her watch: 

"We have time" and she moved into position for sixty-nining. Her cunt was dripping on my face as she pushed her pussy down toward my mouth and as I felt her mouth surround my cock I wondered how in the hell I was ever going to keep Lois from finding out. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The negotiations with McPhearson went well and he said he would have the contracts ready for signature the next day. In the cab on the way back to the hotel Harriet patted my knee and said: 

"Steak tonight lover, you are going to need the energy. I'm planning on an all nighter. You can sleep on the airplane going home." 

At seven she walked through the connecting door and I took one look at her and shook my head. She saw it and asked: 

"What was that for?" 

"It just boggles my mind that you are blackmailing me into having sex with you when you could obviously go downstairs to the cocktail lounge and have men fighting over you as soon as you walk in the door. Look at you. Little black dress, heels, single strand of pearls around your neck and you manage to look classy and incredibly sexy at the same time. You could have your pick." 

"My pick of what? Lounge lizards haunting the bar hoping to get lucky? Who knows where they have been, what their sexual practices are, who they have been with and what marvelous presents they have been given by who they've been with. I don't want a bunch of one-night stands. I want what you have to offer. A continuing, but discrete, affair with a man I know is clean and who will keep his mouth shut about it because he has too much to lose if he doesn't. Come on lover, dinner, drinks, dancing and then a long and exhausting night." 

She turned and headed for the door and I grabbed my suit coat and followed. We had dinner in the restaurant and then went into the lounge and had a few drinks. They had a fairly decent band and Harriet pulled me out onto the dance floor and then moved in close. I hated myself for it, but as she moved against me my cock sprang to life and she smiled when she felt it. 

"Not all of you hates me I see." 

"I don't hate you. I hate me for being so weak that I didn't say, "fuck you" and walk out of your office. I don't like you for what you are making me do to myself, but I don't hate you." 

"I don't mind baby. A girl in my position learns to accept being hated or disliked. It comes with doing the job right. You think I don't know that I'm called "Harriet The Hatchet Lady"? That's my job baby, it guarantees that I'll be hated and disliked. I take no pleasure in disrupting or yes, even ruining lives, but that is what they pay me to do. I'm paid to put the company first and that is just what I do. Enough of that baby, just relax and enjoy the ride. You aren't losing a thing. I'm a great fuck and you are keeping a great job and the little woman will never know unless you tell her" and she pushed her body hard into my erection.  

===

She knew what she was talking about - it was an exhausting night. Harriet was insatiable. I couldn't have stayed with her had there been two of me. She had her hand inside my fly as soon as we were on the elevator to go up to our rooms. Once in the door to my room she had my cock out and holding it she led me to the bed, sat down and then pulled me to her mouth. One hand cupped and caressed my balls as I stood there looking down on the head sliding back and forth on my rod I wondered if I could stand doing it until retirement. 

Suddenly I realized two things: yes I could, but I wouldn't last until retirement. She had made her position clear up front - no man was going to tie her down as she tried to climb as high up the corporate ladder as she could. Not that I could tie her down what with already being married, but I would be baggage none the less. I was her current fuck toy and nothing more. The operative word there was 'current.' At that moment I knew that I was on my way out the door anyway and the only question was, "How long did I have?" 

I felt her mouth leave my dick and she said, "Get naked lover, I need a cock in me." 

The first one was urgent with her telling me to fuck harder, faster, deeper and to make her cum. I did my best, but there was no way to end it quick. I had already gone once that afternoon and I didn't have the recuperative powers of a teenager and each coupling was going to last longer and longer until I couldn't get it up any more. Harriet came three times before I did and then she immediately moved into a sixty-nine so I could keep her going while she worked on getting my cock hard again. Once again all the juices that my cock had held in flowed out of her coating my face. I actually began to look forward to eating Harriet's pussy sometime before we fucked just to see what it would be like to have a squirter cum in my mouth. 

I hadn't eaten the pussy of the squirter that I had known in college because back then I thought I was some kind of macho dude and real men didn't eat pussy, right? That was one of the first things Lois had set me straight on and thinking of Lois just got me to feeling guilty again. I felt my cock start to lose some of its stiffness and Harriet felt it too and she redoubled her efforts and got it started back up again. Once she had me hard she climbed on top, eased herself down on me and began to ride. 

"Like it lover? Like momma riding your pole? Get used to it lover, I like being on top, I like being in control." 

She bounced up and down on me and I looked up at her face and saw that she had her eyes closed. Her head was leaning back and it looked like she was imagining something, like she was seeing something that only she could see. Whatever it was it drove her and she pounded down on me until she was on the edge and then she got off me and pulled me on top of her: 

"Ram it in, drive it hard, make me cum damn you, make me cum." 

I fucked her so hard that sweat was running down my face and for the first time in my life I came at exactly the same time as the woman I was screwing. When I pulled out of her Harriet reached up and tenderly touched my face as she gave me a look that I couldn't decipher and said: 

"Not bad lover, not bad for a grudge fuck. Get your breath back and we will give your dick a rest and let you exercise your tongue for a while." 

I had never in my life imagined that a cunt could be so drenched. Harriet felt like she had buckets in her. I know guys always say things like, "I felt like I shot a quart (or a pint) in her" even though, at least for me, it is only one or two tablespoons, but Harriet had what must have been two cup fulls in her and it was mostly what she had produced herself. 

I went to work on her box with my fingers and I latched onto her clit with my mouth and went after her hard. She was moaning, crying and pushing her muff up at my mouth and after about three minutes she gasped out, "Oh god, here it comes" and I took my fingers out of her cunt and pushed one of them in her asshole. She screamed out, "OH SHIT!" and arched up at me so hard that I felt like some guy had tagged me one on the chin and then I got soaked as she came. I hadn't thought about it, but with no tube like a dick to direct the flow when she came it came out of her like she was pissing and it went all over my face and in my hair. I knelt there looking down at her with her juices dripping off me to fall on her stomach and she lay there gasping for breath and then she went, "Ooooweeee, we have just got to do that again." And then she laughed and said, "But not until you take a shower." 

I was in the shower when she pushed the curtain aside and climbed in with me. "Scrub my back lover and then I'll do yours." We ended up climbing out of the shower and getting back on the bed after getting each other all hot and bothered. I noticed the time and told Harriet that I had to call home and check in like I always did when I was away from home. I was sitting on the edge of the bed talking to Lois when Harriet knelt in front of me and reached for my cock. I tried to push her away and she whispered, "You want me to make some noise?" I shook my head no and she whispered, "Then you had better let me do what I want." 

The guilt I felt over cheating on my wife was nothing compared to the guilt that I felt having my cock sucked as I was talking to her on the phone and most of that guilt came from the fact that I was enjoying it so much. By the time my phone call was over Harriet had my cock rock hard again and she climbed back up on the bed and got on her hands and knees. 

"You like anal lover? I love a hard cock up my ass. Come on lover, fuck my butt." 

I'd never had anal sex before. Lois had said she wasn't interested in trying and I had never cared enough one way or the other to push for it. I moved up behind Harriet, lined my cock up with her asshole and started to push. 

"Whoa whoa whoa" Harriet yelled as she pulled herself away from me. "Just what in the hell are you doing?" 

"You said for me to fuck your ass." 

"Loosen me up damn it. You are acting like you've never had anal sex before." 

"I haven't." 

"No kidding? You've never done it before?" 

"Nope, not ever." 

"Well you have to start slow. Loosen me up with your fingers and thumb before you put the meat to me. Christ! You could have really hurt me." 

Damn! If I had only known I could have moved quicker, driven it home and gotten a little satisfaction out of fucking over her. I went to work on her butt hole with my fingers and when she was satisfied she told me to ease it in. 

"Go slow baby, take it slow and easy. Easy baby, easy. That's it baby, get it all the way in. Okay, okay, slowly back and forth, slowly now, okay, a little faster, oh god, oh god, push baby, push" and then she was pushing her ass back at me. "That's it baby, that's it, fuck my ass, fuck my ass." 

I could feel her ass trying to grip my cock and I couldn't believe how tight she was back there. "Harder baby, harder" she cried and I started pounding into her. She buried her head in a pillow to muffle her screams. I couldn't tell if they were from pain or pleasure, but then I didn't really care because she had asked for it. It took me a while and when I came in her ass I was done for the night. She wasn't happy about it, but after ten minutes of trying she gave up trying to get me hard again. 

We slept in our own beds that night, but she woke me up in the morning with a blow job and I had recovered enough by then to be able to perform. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

We drove out to the McPhearson factory at ten, signed the contracts and then McPhearson invited us to lunch with him and a few of his key people. One of those people was Charlie Ritter who was an old friend of mine. Charlie shared an interest in old cars with me and he told me had something in his office he wanted to show me: 

"It will go great with your 1965 Mustang." 

That confused me for a moment, but then I asked Harriet to excuse me for a moment and I followed Charlie to his office. I was back five minutes later and we headed off to lunch. 

The flight home was quiet. Harriet and I had first class seats next to each other, but neither of us had anything to say to the other. She wouldn't have liked hearing what I would like to have said, and she had nothing to say to me because all I was to her was a human dildo and who talks to dildo's? 

I used the quiet time to run through what I would have to do to make sure that Lois didn't find anything to make her anymore suspicious than she already was. I had showered after Harriet and I had sex. Everything we had done we had done naked, but to be safe all the clothes that I had worn on the trip were in a laundry bag and I would drop it off at the cleaners on the way home. The only thing I had to sweat was my own behavior - I had to guard against acting as guilty as I felt. It was not going to be an easy thing to do. 

I was right to have taken precautions because when I went to use the bathroom after I got home I saw Lois make a beeline for my suitcases to check them for evidence that I had been fucking around. She didn't find anything, but that didn't stop her: 

"Was the whore any good in bed? And don't tell me you didn't do anything. I've seen the bitch and you just spent two nights away from home with her." 

I didn't even bother to answer her, I just went into the den, opened my briefcase and sat down at the desk and reviewed contracts. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

For the next two months Harriet made good use of her sex toy. There were plenty of long lunches, late night meetings and several business trips. Occasionally the day would start with Harriet sitting in the edge of her desk while I ate her pussy and at least twice a week she would have me take her cunt or ass as she bent forward over her desk. 

It was a very confusing time for me. I hated having to do it, but I loved doing it. I dreaded the call to her office, but looked forward to stuffing my cock up her ass or into her pussy and to having her give me blow jobs. And then when it was over I felt guilty as hell. 

During that period Lois was pretty subdued. She wasn't her usual suspicious self and considering the number of late night 'business meetings' I was having it wasn't natural. I put the change down to her embarrassment at having been caught spying on me, but I was wrong. Just how wrong I found out at lunch on a Tuesday. I was having lunch with Harriet at the Hilton, just prior to going up to room 409 to make it a long lunch hour, when a man approached the table. He looked at me and asked: 

"Mr. Walker, Mr. Robert Walker?" 

"Yes? May I help you?" 

"This is for you and he handed me an envelope. I took it from him and he said, "You have been served." 

I opened it up and found that Lois was suing me for divorce. No grounds were specified, but since we lived in a no fault state none were really needed. 

"Bad news?" Harriet asked? 

"Nothing I hadn't expected" I lied 

I put the papers in my pocket; we finished lunch and then headed up to room 409. For the first time since the affair started I took charge. As soon as we were in the room I pulled Harriet into my arms and kissed her hard. I shoved my tongue down her throat and my hands started to unbutton her blouse. She broke the kiss and tried to push my hands away, "Stop that Rob, let me do it." 

I grabbed both sides of the blouse and pulled and the buttons popped off and fell on the floor. I hooked a finger in the front of her bra and pulled down exposing her tits and then bent my head and took a nipple in my mouth. She tried to push me away and I bit down, not hard enough to break the skin, but hard enough to make stop fighting me. After that I did what I wanted. If she said stop I pushed forward. If she said slow down I went faster. If she said, "No Rob, I don't want to do that" I did it anyway. I took what I wanted and to hell with her. At one point, just after I had fucked her ass, I had the thumb of my right hand in her cunt with my right index finger in her ass holding her like a bowling ball. My left hand was holding a handful of her hair pulling her head back and as she opened her mouth to protest I shoved my shit covered dick into her mouth and face fucked her. 

I was a bull. I don't know where it came from, but I was staying hard and I was using the bitch. I fucked her six times that afternoon, two more than I had ever done before in my life and the only thing I can think of that made it happen was that I wanted to punish the fucking bitch and my body went along with it. When I was finally done and had collapsed on the bed Harriet was lying next to me, fondling my cock and trying to catch her breath, "Ooowheee baby, what got into you?" 

"I was able to turn it loose boss lady, I just don't feel guilty about doing it anymore." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

When I got back to the office that afternoon I called the house and Lois answered. 

"I got your surprise package. When would be a good time for me to come by and get my stuff." 

"That's it? When can you get your stuff? You don't have anything else to say? You don't want to talk about it?" 

"Nope. The time to talk would have been before you served me with papers." 

"Fine then. If that's the way you want it. I'll be out of the house this evening and I'll find something to do over the weekend so you can get everything you want out of here." 

"That will work," I said and I hung up. 

In a way the divorce was a relief. I loved Lois, God knows I did, but her constant suspicious nature (even though justified by my recent behavior) and violent behavior was a drag and she had been getting harder and harder to live with. 

The kids were out on their own for the most part. They had their own apartments and only came home from college during spring break, Christmas break or summer vacation. I had no idea how they would take their mother and me splitting, but they were old enough to get over it. 

I hired a lawyer, gave him the divorce papers and then got an apartment and a storage unit and by Sunday night I was out of the house. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

For the next two months Harriet and I had unrestrained sex in the office, at her apartment or at mine. Lois called half a dozen times a week, but I didn't take her calls or return them. As far as I was concerned she had put it into the hands of the lawyers when she filed so let the lawyers do the talking. 

I had bigger problems to worry about than Lois; I was waiting for the other shoe to fall. I had hoped it wouldn't, but it did. Harriet called me into her office one morning and told me to have a seat. She was looking through a folder and I knew it was my personnel file. She set it down and looked up at me. 

"I'm sorry Rob, but this isn't working out. I told you way back that my gut feeling was to let you go and I should have done it then." 

"Why didn't you?" 

"Don't be dumb Rob, you know why." 

"What has changed since then?" 

"You are getting divorced." 

"What does that have to do with anything? What does that have to do with my job? I did what you wanted. You told me that if I had sex with you I could keep my job. How can you fire me now?" 

"The excitement of fucking you was not from what you brought to the table sexually. The excitement came from my taking another woman's husband away from her. As long as you were married I got my rocks off from knowing that your cock was mine whenever I wanted it while she patiently waited for you at home. I got orgasms from being able to pick up the phone and tell you to get your ass in here and get down on your knees and eat my pussy while your wife was at home doing the breakfast dishes. Single, you have nothing to offer. 

"I want a younger man in your job anyway. Even if you had stayed married I would have eventually gotten rid of you to make room for younger blood. You old guys don't have the vision needed in today's global economy. Your divorce just speeded things up. I want you out of the building by the end of the day. Check in with Helen in Human Resources and she'll go over your severance package with you." 

"You can't do this. We had a deal. I'll file sexual harassment charges against you." 

"Oh grow up Rob. It is your word against mine and you are a disgruntled employee trying to strike back. No one is going to believe you." 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

But they did. 

When we had been in Chicago negotiating with McPhearson Charlie Ritter had taken me aside, ostensibly to talk about my 1965 Mustang, but I knew he wanted to talk about something else because a year previous I had sold him the Mustang to get money to buy a 1934 Ford 3 Window Coupe. 

"How tight are you with your new boss?" he asked. 

"Why? What's up?" 

"She took over your place, what, two months ago?" 

"About that yeah." 

"And you are over forty and you are still there so that means you are fucking her." 

"I don't understand Charlie, how does that follow?" 

And then Charlie told me the story. He had been working for Apex when Titan bought them out. Harriet had been moved in as interim president. A friend of Charlie's had called him to warn him about Harriet. Seems that she would look over the high level management, pick one she would like to fuck for a while and then hit him with the be my fuck toy and keep your job line. She'd fuck the guy until his wife caught him or until Harriet got tired of him. If the wife didn't catch on to what hubby was doing on her own she would get an anonymous phone call from a woman telling her that her husband was cheating on her, but not with who. Charlie didn't believe it until it happened to Melvin Hicks at Apex. 

"So watch your back Rob. If you are her target you'll get a good ride, but you are already toast. The day your wife sues you for divorce your days at XYZ are numbered." 

I remembered my thoughts of the night before - about my being baggage - and when we had gotten home from our trip one of my first stops was Radio Shack to buy a mini-recorder and a lapel button microphone. From that day forward I never went into Harriet's office without that recorder in my pocket and already turned on. I not only had my termination meeting with Harriet on tape I had several of our sex sessions where she was ordering me around. 

I gave it all to my lawyer. The first thing he asked me was if I was willing to share whatever I got in a settlement with my wife. I thought about that for a minute and then said no, I didn't want her to get a dime of it. 

"Then we need to fast track your divorce so that you are single when we file against Titan." 

I told him to get with the lawyer that Lois had hired and get it done. "Give Lois whatever she wants as long as it is based on my current situation." 

"What do you mean by "current situation?" 

"I've just lost my job and any financially settlement, including alimony, will have to be based on whatever I'm making when I find a new job." 

Then I went job hunting. I landed a job at a manufacturing plant making a third of what I'd made at XYZ. The divorce gave Lois one third of my wages, half of my 401k and the house, which she promptly had to sell because she couldn't make the payments. After the real estate commissions and paying off the first and second mortgages she netted about sixty thousand and she ended up paying capital gains on that because she didn't put the money back into another house. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

One week after the divorce was final the lawyer called me and asked me to meet him at XYZ the next day at nine. We were ushered into the conference room where I was surprised to see Jason Boggs, the president and CEO of Titan. There were also three vice presidents, Harriet, and three corporate lawyers.  

===

My lawyer got right to the point. 

"I asked for this meeting to see if we could possibly avoid a publicity nightmare for Titan and a half dozen very expensive law suits. My client intends to sue for wrongful termination, sexual harassment, age discrimination and alienation of affections leading to the end of his marriage of over twenty years. I'll let Mr. Walker describe the events leading up to this meeting." 

I described my first meeting with Harriet where she said basically, "Fuck me or lose your job" and then I described what she'd said during the meeting when she had fired me. Boggs turned to Harriet and asked, "Is this true Ms. Mosser?" 

"Absolutely not Jason. He is bitter over being let go and he is trying to scare us into taking him back or buying him off." 

At that point my lawyer hit the play button on the tape recorder and sat back to watch how Boggs would react. I was watching Harriet and I saw the blood drain from her face and I smiled at her. When the tape ended Boggs turned to Harriet: 

"I want you out of this building in an hour. If that isn't enough time for you to clean out your office give HR the address where we can send what you haven't carried out. One hour. Not one minute more or security will carry you out." 

He turned to my lawyer and said, "What do you want?" 

"First, let us see where we are. Rob, would you please tell these gentlemen why you were wearing a tape recorder to your meetings with Ms. Mosser." 

I told them about my talk with Charlie and how he had warned me and then my lawyer said: 

"We have contacted Mr. Ritter and he will testify if necessary. We have talked with Melvin Hicks and he also is willing to testify. Ms. Mosser also did the same thing at Dynetics, Ajax and Bryermann when you acquired those properties. We will find who she stuck it to at those places and I'm positive we can have them in court when we go to trial. 

"Mrs. Walker will testify that the voice on this tape, Ms. Mosser, is the same voice that called her and told her that her husband was cheating on her (this was a bluff - neither of us had talked to Lois since she filed for divorce) and where she could go to find enough proof. 

"We will maintain that the pattern is repetitive and that after the second or third time Ms. Mosser did what she did you either should have been aware or that possibly you were aware and didn't stop her because it is what you wanted her or expected her to do. A jury might accept once as Ms. Mosser's responsibility, but I doubt that a jury will buy that she did it five times on her own. 

"Now, as to what we want. Obviously Mr. Walker doesn't not want his job back. It would be too difficult for all concerned to have him here. He has excellent merit reviews and he could reasonably have expected at least one more promotion to the level of executive vice president. He is forty-four and had sixteen years to go until retirement. At his base salary of eighty-five thousand a year, with annual raises and bonuses, he would have made one point nine million by the time he retired. That figure will cover the wrongful termination charge. The sexual harassment and age discrimination charges along with emotional pain and suffering, destruction of his marriage and a few other things I'm thinking of throwing in brings the figure we would be comfortable with to eight million dollars." 

"You are out of your mind!" Boggs shouted. 

"I would suggest you talk it over with your legal people. The wrongful termination, age discrimination and sexual harassment are a lock. The only iffy is the alienation of affections and I give us a solid seventy percent chance on that. What we are asking is quite possibly a great deal less than a jury would give us. Plus there is the publicity angle to consider. I will, repeat - WILL - make sure that the press has a field day with this case and how do you think that will go over on Wall Street? 

"Talk it over and get back to us by day after tomorrow at the latest. If I don't hear from you by then I plan to file on Thursday. Come on Rob, let us leave these gentlemen to their discussions." 

We got up and left. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

The lawyer called me the next day at three and told me he had just gotten off the phone with XYZ. 

"They offered to settle for four million." 

"What should I do?" 

"It's a gamble. I'm certain we can win in court, but you never know what a jury will do. They could find for you, but only award you a minimal sum or they could be so pissed at Titan that they give you ten times what we asked for." 

"This is your game, not mine. Advise me." 

"I would suggest that you turn it down. I do not believe they want to go to court on this. This is one case where I think we can plat hardball and win." 

"Go for it." 

We ended up settling for six point five million. The lawyer's cut was thirty- five percent which still left me with two point seven million after taxes. I bought a three bedroom town house so I'd have room for the kids when they came to visit and I set myself up in my own business and I'm doing quite well. 

I talk to the kids at least once a week and they want Lois and me to get back together. They tell me that Lois keeps after them to try and get me to talk to her. They tell me that she knows she did a stupid thing and that she still loves me and wants us to be a family again. 

I haven't seen her since I left the house the morning that she served me with the papers and I've only had three perfunctory talks on the phone with her. Every one thinks I'm being an ass for treating her the way I am, but she did it to her self. She should have at least confronted me and talked with me before she did what she did. 

I'm dating Molly, my old secretary from XYZ, and we seem to be getting along well. These days I think back to what my dad said about taking the bad with the good and hoping the good will outweigh the bad in the end. I think that I am at that point, the good most definitely has the upper hand. Report_Story
