===

It started out as a joke and then things kind of got out of hand. Not that I'm complaining mind you, because as far as I'm concerned it all worked out. 

I had gone through a rough stretch, losing my job and my fianc‚e within two weeks of each other. I was down on life and I was down on women. I'd had a great job, one that I actually enjoyed getting up in the morning and going to. Everything was great right up to the morning I showed up for work, found the door locked and a notice taped to the window that said the IRS had seized the place for non payment of taxes. The owner of the company disappeared owing all of the employee's wages and it was three weeks before I could even get into the building to get my personal possessions. Even then I had to prove to the IRS that the stuff was mine and not the company's. 

I took the second hit nine days later when Karen, my fianc‚e, told me during dinner at Mike's Chop House that she was going to postpone the wedding. 

"I've decided that it just wouldn't be fair to you to marry you right now," was how she put it, "Maybe later, but not now." 

Naturally I was a little upset what with the wedding being only two months away and I pressed for a reason and she had them. Four of them in fact. 

"I love you Rob, I honestly do and I know that you love me, but I guess the truth of the matter is that I'm not ready to settle down. I keep meeting interesting guys and wanting to get to know them better. On nights you've worked late or been out of town I've dated." 

When I pressed for a more detailed explanation I got much, much more than I wanted. Joe, a guy she worked with, kept trying to get her to go out with him. She finally did and she enjoyed herself and so she went out with him again. On the sixth date he managed to get her in bed. 

"It was a disaster Rob. He wasn't anywhere as good as you and when it was over I never went out with him again. 

But Joe was followed by Alan who was followed by Tom who was followed by Jim. She swore that none of them were any good in bed and that none of them made her feel like I did. 

"The bottom line Rob is that I'm still curious and just yesterday this really cute guy asked me for a date and I said yes. We need to postpone the wedding until I get this curiousness out of my system." 

I asked her the time frame during which she was climbing into all these beds and she told me that it had been in the last two months. While we were planning the wedding and the honeymoon she had been bed hopping. I thanked her for telling me and then said that postponing the wedding was not the way to go; we should just cancel the wedding altogether and then I got up from the table. 

"Where are you going?" 

"Away from you Karen. You are apparently a round heeled slut and I don't need one of those in my life - now or ever." 

She was crying when I walked away from her and whether it was from the knowledge that I never wanted to see her again or that I stuck her with the check I would never know. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I started looking for another job. I was having lunch with my sister Cathy one day and she told me that they had openings where she worked. 

"I thought that they had a policy of not hiring relatives of current employees." 

"They do, but no one knows that you are my brother. My married name is different than yours so if you put down "no" in the section that asks if you have relatives working there they will never know." 

"That's all fine and dandy Cathy, but we can't hide the fact that we are close." 

"We don't have to hide it. If you get the job on your first day I'll act surprised as hell and then let everyone know that you are an ex lover that I had let get away, but that I had never gotten completely over. That should cover any affection that people might see. It will be fun. I have a reputation as a 'goody two-shoes' and it will set some of the women on their ear, especially the gossipy ones, when the married lady takes long lunches with her ex lover." 

"A goody two shoes? You?" 

"Yeah, me. I won't stop with the crew after work for drinks because the first time I did every guy in the office was trying to get me to go out to the parking lot with them and play the 'back seat bounce.' I don't care for that kind of stuff so I never stopped again." 

"But as my ex lover you will stop if I stop, is that what you are saying?" 

"Probably. We might even give the gossips some good stuff to work with." 

"How's that?" 

"Imagine if you and I were to go out to the parking lot and then came back in later." 

"Oh Cathy, you are indeed evil." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I did apply and I did get the job and things did pretty much go the way Cathy had outlined. We had lunch two or three times a week and we did stop about twice a week with the gang after work. There were at least half a dozen good looking women in the group and I had already picked one out, but when I mentioned it to Cathy she would have none of it. 

"You're mine honey, at least until I've stood this group on their ear. After that you can spread as much pollen as you like, but not until I've had my fun." 

The first night we stopped with the group she made sure she sat next to me at the table and when I made no move to get her out on the dance floor she grabbed my hand and drug me out there. After a couple of minutes she maneuvered so her back was too the table and she asked me if the group was watching. I looked over her shoulder and saw that most of them were. 

"Kiss me" she said. 

"What?" 

"Kiss me. You are an ex lover who is still hot for me." 

I went to kiss her on the cheek and she said, "Don't you dare! You're hot for me; make it look right." 

You have any idea how weird it is to have your sister's tongue down your throat? To have her rubbing her body up against yours? How about when that rubbing gives you a woodie and your sister giggles and says: 

"Wow, that gives a whole new meaning to "big brother." 

When the music stopped she wouldn't let me go back to the table. "You need to get rid of that blush little brother and stop being so flustered before we go back. I'm a married woman who is still hot for an ex lover and you are supposed to be still hot for me, not embarrassed." 

Cathy had me put some more money in the jukebox and we stayed out for three more songs before heading back to the table. I saw the ladies at the table eyeing the tent in my trousers and I was wishing like hell that one of them could take care of it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

We repeated that scenario the next two times we stopped after work and Cathy always managed to make it look like she was chasing me. Once at work, in front of three girls, she pulled me into a supply closet and then she kissed me to smear lipstick on me for the girls to see when we came out. 

Cathy was having a ball, but I was suffering big time. She might have been my big sister, but she was still a good looking sexy woman. Being my sister didn't make her tits any less real when she rubbed them against me. Being related to me didn't make the pussy she kept rubbing against my leg or erection a fake one. Oh yes, she was giving the gossips a field day, but she was sending me home with a severe case of blue balls. 

It all came to a head one Friday night when we stopped after work for drinks with the crew. We were on the dance floor and Cathy was up tight against me rubbing her tits against my chest and her crotch against my leg (and erection) and she whispered in my ear: 

"Tonight's the night little brother. When we finish this dance we will make the trip to the parking lot. By this time tomorrow my 'goody two-shoes' reputation will be toast." 

"I still don't understand why you are doing this. Why do you want your co- workers thinking you are a married slut?" 

"Just being perverse little brother. They labeled me without knowing anything about me so I feel the need to stick it to them." 

The music stopped and she led me back to the table where she said: 

"You guys watch my purse, okay?" and then she led me out the door and into the parking lot. 

"Now what?" 

"We get in the back seat of your car and wait the proper amount of time and then go back inside." 

We got in the back of my car and the door had just barely closed when Cathy said, "Oh shit!" 

"What?" 

"Harriet must not have believed her eyes. She followed us out and she's hiding behind a car watching us. Kiss me." 

"What?" 

"Kiss me damn it" and she grabbed my head and shoved her tongue down my throat. I just kind of sat there and Cathy said, "Come on Rob, help me out here, make it look good" and she kissed me again. "Come on Rob, make it look real" and so I kissed her back. 

While we swapped tongues Cathy kept looking over my shoulder at where Harriet was hiding. Cathy broke the kiss long enough to mutter, "Stupid fucking bitch! Why doesn't she go back inside" and she went back to frenching me. A minute later she grabbed my left hand and put it on her breasts. 

"Come on Robbie, we're hot for each other remember? Give her a good show." 

So there I was on the back seat of my car pawing my sister's tit and she's frenching the hell out of me and suddenly Cathy decides that it isn't enough. She decides that Harriet needs to see us fucking. She broke the kiss, pulled her skirt to her waist and then lay down on the seat. She put her right leg over the front seat back and had her left up in the air and she said: 

"Get down here Rob and pretend you're doing me." 

I'm looking down at her and my eyes are locked onto her pussy. She had a little itty bitty thong on and her pussy hairs are curling out beyond the edges of the material. Cathy reached up, grabbed my shirt and pulled me down. 

"Come on Rob, move your butt. Make it look like you're doing me." 

She had pulled me down so that my erection was right against her mound. She kept after me to move my butt so I did and my hard cock was rubbing against her cunt. I don't know if it was doing anything to her, but I was about to lose it in my pants. 

"Just one more minute Robbie, just one more minute." 

Over my shoulder she saw Harriet at the window actually looking into the car and she wrapped her legs around me and started pushing her panty covered pussy up at my pants covered cock and her hands pulled my face down and she shoved her tongue in my mouth again. 

There is a point where a man can be so sexually charged up that he stops thinking, or stops thinking clearly anyway. I was at that point. Three weeks of play acting with Cathy and constantly going home with blue balls; the nights dancing, the frenching, Cathy's putting my hands on her tits and the fake sex on the back seat with my hard cock rubbing Cathy's pussy finally got me to the point where I lost it. It didn't matter to me any more that she was my sister. She was a pussy all ready spread out on my back seat and all that was between my cock and what it wanted was a zipper and an easily pushed aside thong. 

I pulled my zipper down and worked my cock out of my pants. I hooked a finger under the thong and pulled it aside and suddenly Cathy pulled her tongue out of my mouth and looked at me wide eyed. 

"What are you doing? Stop that Rob, stop that right now." 

My cock was poking at her pussy, trying to find a way in, and Cathy was struggling to get out from under me. 

"Stop it Rob, stop it! Harriet is gone." 

Then she slapped my face and hissed, "Get off me damn it." The blow caused me to shake my head which cleared it some and I got up from Cathy and sat on the seat with my hard cock sticking up out of my fly. Cathy sat up and screamed at me: 

"Just what the fuck were you going to do? What kind of a pervert are you anyway? I'm your sister for God's sake. Just what kind of an asshole would try and take advantage of his sister." 

I was sitting there, hard cock still standing straight up, as she verbally abused me and called me every rotten name she could think of and then I totally lost it. 

"Me? I'm a fucking pervert? Just whose idea was it to play these stupid fucking games?" 

I pointed at my hard cock, "You think I just willed that to get hard? You're the one rubbing your tits all over me, putting my hands on them and telling me to make it look good. You're the one who has been rubbing your pussy against my cock for three fucking weeks now. You are the one who was just humping your pussy up at my cock a minute ago so don't be calling me names." 

"Listen you fucking assh..." and she didn't finish what she was going to say because I reached and grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her head down. She opened her mouth to protest and I shoved my cock into the open hole and held her head in a death grip. I hunched up fucking her face a half dozen strokes and shot my wad. She had to gulp and swallow because I wouldn't let go of her head. As my cock started to go soft I woke up to the fact that I had just fucked up big time. 

I dropped my hands and my cock fell out of Cathy's mouth. She jerked her head up and looked at me with hatred and disgust flaming from her eyes. 

"You bastard! You dirty fucking bastard!" she snarled as she scrambled to get out of the car. I watched her walk into the bar and less than two minutes later she came out with her purse, got in her car and drove off. I sat in my back seat and stared after her until her taillights disappeared. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I don't know why I lost it and did what I did. All I knew is that it was wrong and that I had fucked up. Would Cathy go home and tell her husband Stan and would he come looking for me with a gun? Worse, would she tell our folks? She couldn't do anything at work except scowl at me or ignore me. She couldn't cost me my job without putting her own job at risk. After all, she was the one who spread the ex lover story even though I was her brother. I didn't think that the powers that be in the company would take kindly to her trying to pull the wool over their eyes. No, all I had to sweat was mom, dad and Stan. And of course Cathy. She might even come after me with a gun. 

It being the beginning of the weekend I decided that my best bet was to get out of Dodge. I drove home, packed a bag and headed for the beach. I checked into a motel and then spent Saturday and Sunday lying on the sand, soaking up sun and trying hard not to worry about what might be waiting for me when I home. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was late Sunday when I got home and no one was sitting on my doorstep waiting for me and I took that as a good sign. No flashing light on the telephone answering machine either - another good sign. What wasn't good was trying to sleep that night knowing that I would be going into work in the morning and seeing Cathy. In the end that turned out to be a non-event. She ignored me. 

For the next two weeks it was as if I did not exist as far as Cathy was concerned. If we were in the lunchroom at the same time she sat as far across the room as she could get and usually with her back to me. Wednesday of the second week I was in the lunchroom looking at Cathy's back when Darla sat down across from me. She saw where I was looking and she said: 

"Trouble in paradise? A cooling of the relationship?" 

Even though Cathy and I were not talking I still had to play the role. "She wants it both ways; she wants to be married to Stan, but still play with me. She got pissed when I told her I wasn't going to buy into that." 

"Is the relationship going to heal?" 

"It never should have started in the first place. When I came to work on my first day and saw her I should have just turned around and gone back to job hunting." 

"Well, if she's history it might interest you to know that there are a couple of girls here who are interested in you. You should stop with the gang after work more often." 

"It would be awkward with Cathy there." 

"Shouldn't be a problem. She never stopped before you came to work here. If you've split I doubt that she will stop." 

"Is this your way of saying that you are interested?" 

"No, I'm spoken for, but because I'm neutral I can try and be a matchmaker. So, you going to stop tonight?" 

"Don't know. I'll think on it." 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I did stop that night and I did have a good time dancing with the women there. I stopped again on Friday night and had such a good time that I asked Gloria to have dinner with me on Saturday and she said yes. Saturday's date led to a Tuesday date which in turn led me to spending most of my time dancing with Gloria when we stopped at the bar after work. 

That Friday I was in the lunchroom at the same time Cathy was, but his time she didn't sit with her back to me and she watched me the entire time I sat there. In fact, she never took her eyes off of me. Ten minutes after lunch my phone rang. The read-out on the panel said the call was internal from extension 127. I27 was Cathy's extension. I stared at the phone and debated on pretending I wasn't at my desk and just let it keep ringing, but then I decided that I had to talk to her sooner or later and I might as well get it over with. 

"Yes?" 

"Why are you doing this to me?" 

"Why am I doing what to you?" 

"Making me into a laughing stock/" 

"And just how am I doing that?" 

"By going out with that bitch Gloria." 

"Just how in the hell is that making you a laughing stock?" 

"You are supposed to be my lover. Going out with her has everyone snickering at me behind my back." 

"Have you forgotten that you are married Cathy? And that I am your brother? You got what you wanted. No one thinks of you as Miss Purity any more. Besides, our office romance had to end sometime. Everyone in the office has seen how cool you have been toward me lately and they all think that you came to your senses and decided not to risk your marriage over me." 

"You know full well why I have been cool toward you." 

"Yes I do and I am sorry. I don't know what made me do what I did and I am ashamed of myself. I truly regret it and I'll be apologizing for my behavior for years to come, but at the same time I'm not going to forget who led me to the edge and helped push me over it. It had to end and it has." 

"But it didn't end the way it was supposed too. I was supposed to drop you in a way that let everyone know it was me letting you go, but now everyone is laughing at me because they think that Gloria took you away from me." 

"Cathy, get a grip on yourself" and I hung up on her. The phone rang several more times and the panel showed that the calls were from extension 127 so I didn't pick up. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I was surprised to see Cathy at the bar when I stopped that night. As usual the crew had put three tables together to make one long table and Gloria was sitting at one end and Cathy was sitting at the other. I immediately knew I was in trouble. If I sat near Cathy I could kiss my burgeoning relationship with Gloria goodbye and if I sat with Gloria only God knew what Cathy might do. The third choice was to sit in the center well away from both of them, but that would just tell everybody I was a coward. 

As I approached the table it dawned on me just how stupid I was being. Why was I even thinking about choices? On the one hand there was a woman I wanted to get to know better and on the other was my sister who was playing games. I sat down on the seat next to Gloria and I saw Cathy's jaw tighten. I ordered a drink and then I led Gloria out onto the dance floor. 

As I took her in my arms and started dancing she said, "I wondered what you would do." 

"It was a no brainer. A choice between a girl I want to get to know better and a married woman looking for a thrill is really no choice at all." 

"Oh? And just how much better do you want to know me?"  

===

"The question is how much better do you want me to know you?" 

"I'll need to give that some thought, won't I?" 

Back at the table I pretty much ignored Cathy and maybe a half-hour went by. Then Gloria got up to use the ladies room and Cathy got up, came over to me and said, "Come on Rob, dance with me" and she took my arm to pull me up. I didn't want to, but I didn't want to cause a scene either so I followed her out onto the floor. 

"Do you have any idea how you are making me look? It is embarrassing." 

"I'm not doing anything Cathy, you are doing it to yourself. For the last two weeks everyone has assumed that you finally came to your senses and decided that your marriage is more important than an ex lover. Now you are making it look like you are chasing me. It is your imagination that people are laughing at you behind your back and if you don't get yourself under control they might actually start." 

"Can we go out to your car? I need to talk to you and it needs to be private." 

"I don't think so Cathy. We have taken the game as far as it needed to go." 

"Please Rob, this is important to me." 

I looked over at the table and Gloria was not back yet so I told Cathy I would give her five minutes. We went out to my car, got in and Cathy took a deep breath and said: 

"Rob, I need, really need for you to keep on being my lover until I can end it the way I want to." 

"That's what you need Cathy, but what I need is a normal relationship with a woman. I can't play games any more. Doing what you want and then going home with a case of blue balls just doesn't cut it for me." 

"You don't have to go home with blue balls," she said as she unbuttoned her blouse and took it off. She wasn't wearing a brassiere and she grabbed my hands and took them up to her tits. 

"I can do what you made me do the other night Rob. I promise you that if you help me you will never go home with blue balls again." 

She reached for my zipper and I was so stunned and surprised that she had her hand inside my fly and on my cock before I knew what was happening. I jerked my hands away from her tits and pulled her hand out of my fly. 

"Have you lost your mind? My God Cathy, you are a married woman and this was only supposed to be a game, a little fun, just something to tweak a few noses. Give it up Cathy; let it go. You did what you wanted to do. They changed the way they think of you. End it! End it now! Get your blouse back on." 

I got out of the car and went back into the bar. Gloria wasn't at the table and I glanced toward the restrooms. Darla saw it and said: 

"She's gone. When she found out that you went out to the parking lot with Cathy she left." 

Great, I thought, just fucking great. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I tried calling Gloria, but all I got was her answering machine. After nine attempts I gave up and went to bed. The next day at work I headed for Gloria's desk as soon as I walked in the door, but she saw me coming and she got up and went to the bathroom. I waited almost ten minutes, but she didn't come back so I gave up the wait and went to work. Twice more during the day I tried to see her, but she always saw me coming and managed to avoid me. 

That afternoon I left work ten minutes early and when Gloria got off work she found me sitting on the hood of her car. There was an exasperated tone in her voice when she asked: 

"What do you want Rob?" 

"To talk to you about last night." 

"I don't want to talk about last night." 

"But I do Gloria. It wasn't what it looked like and I need to explain." 

"You are a grown man Rob, you get to do what you want and you certainly do not need to explain it to me." 

"Yes I do Gloria. It is very important to me that you don't have bad thoughts about me. Give me ten minutes and when I'm done if you tell me to piss off I'll never bother you again, but please hear me out." 

"Ten minutes? Where?" 

"In your car will be fine." 

We got inside her car, I took a deep breath and then I told her everything that happened form the day Cathy told me there were openings where she worked right up until the previous evening (leaving out of course what Cathy had done the night before and what happened the night I lost control). 

"Why are you telling me this?" 

"I meant it when I said I really wanted to get to know you better. I can't do that if you aren't talking to me." 

"Your sister. Wow. That's wild." 

"Can I salvage anything out of this?" 

"I don't know Rob. I'm going to have to think about it. Give me a couple of days okay?" 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Cathy avoided me the next two days and I suspect that it was because she was embarrassed over what she had done. On the second day Gloria asked me to meet her for breakfast before work on the following day. I was surprised when I got to the restaurant to find her sitting in a booth with Cathy. Once I had my coffee and the waitress had taken my order Gloria said: 

"Okay Rob, Cathy and I have talked it over and this is how we are going to handle this." 

I started to say something and Gloria held her hand up and said, "Wait until I'm done. You and I can date on the weekends, but as far as work is concerned, for the next two weeks you and Cathy will continue to have your fake affair. Near the end of the second week she will end it and I will spread the word that I overheard her telling you that she was dropping you to save her marriage. You will act down in the dumps for a while and then I will offer you a shoulder to cry on which will lead to our spending more time together and we will see where things go from there." 

During this speech Cathy never looked at me and she let Gloria handle things. 

"As far as the office is concerned we are already split." 

"That will all be forgotten when you and Cathy stop at the bar tonight. Just act the way you did before." 

"I still don't understand. As far as everyone at work is concerned it is already over between us. Why go through all this nonsense just so we can be over with again?" 

"Because it is important to Cathy that it ends the way she wants it to end. That's all you need to know so humor us, okay?" 

I looked at Cathy, over at Gloria and then back at Cathy. "Two weeks. Two weeks and it's over, right?" 

Cathy nodded a yes and I said, "Okay. I'll give it two weeks, but then it is done whether on your terms or mine. Agreed?" 

Cathy nodded a yes just as the waitress brought us our food. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

For the next two weeks Cathy and I stopped at the bar every Tuesday and Thursday. We danced, we kissed and twice we went out to the parking lot and pretended we were having sex on the back seat of my car. The first of those Tuesdays she rubbed my bulge and whispered that she meant it when she said she would never send me home with blue balls again. 

"It isn't like it hasn't all ready happened and it is something I do for Stan all the time." 

I pushed her hand away, "It did happen Cathy and I'm sorry I was so weak, but I can't let it happen again. I can tough it out for two weeks." 

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday I dated Gloria and I was beginning to think I had found my new significant other. 

On the Thursday of the second week Cathy and I were eating lunch in the lunchroom with Gloria and Darla sitting at a table behind us. Cathy finished her lunch and then told me that she was ending our relationship. 

"I'm sorry Rob, I really am, but I love my husband and if I keep on seeing you he will eventually find out and it would kill my marriage. I really care for you Rob and there are times I wish we had never broken up way back when. But we did break up and I met Stan. I guess I never really realized how much I loved him until it came time for me to make a choice between the two of you. I hope we can still be friends." 

"We can, but no tempting me. No asking me to dance when we stop at the bar. I don't think I could handle being that close to you and not having you. Okay?" 

"I think I can handle that" and she got up and left me sitting there. 

By two that afternoon Gloria and Darla had made sure that everyone knew about Cathy dumping me. That night at the bar I sat and stared at my beer like a dejected man with a broken heart. I played the part of a discarded lover and finally mumbled something about being 'a wet blanket' and I got up and left. 

The next night I showed up at Gloria's to pick her up for a dinner date. She invited me in, told me she wasn't quite ready yet and told me to have a seat on the couch. 

"I'll be back in just a minute." 

Maybe two minutes later she came back into the room wearing only high heels and nylons with a garter belt. 

"I decided that we will stay in tonight. You are so gloomy over losing Cathy that you wouldn't be fun anyway. Fortunately I know that the best cure for someone's broken heart is to fuck his brains out. You want it here or in the bedroom?" 

We left a trail of my clothes from the front door to her bedroom. I gently pushed her back on the bed and began licking her erect nipples. She moaned as my hand went down and rubbed her pussy and she gasped when I parted her pussy lips with a finger and found her clit. My mouth left her nipples and I licked and kissed my way down her body and she moaned as my tongue probed her belly button. I had two fingers in her pussy by then and I could feel the pressure as she pushed up at my hand. I kissed and licked my way from her navel down to her mons and then I removed my fingers and replaced them with my tongue. 

"Oh God" she moaned and then she said, "I want something to play with too" and her hand found my stiff cock. She tugged on it and I knew what she wanted. I turned and moved my body so we were in the classic sixty-nine position and as I pushed my tongue deep into her she took my cock into her hot mouth. 

I started working on her clit and her tongue swirled around my cock. I couldn't hold back. All of the activity with Cathy, all of the times I went home with an aching cock, had me on edge and I was ready to let go. I tried to lift off Gloria, but she grabbed me and held me as I exploded into her mouth. Again I tried to lift up, but she pulled me back and she gulped and swallowed every drop I pushed out. 

I thought she would let me go as I softened, but she kept sucking and licking until I started to come alive again in the cock department. While that was going on I was attacking her pussy like a man possessed and I was rewarded by hearing her mewls of pleasure as she worked on my cock. Her hips were pushing up at my mouth and I felt that she was close. I slid a finger to her ass and I teased her rose bud. She gave a loud moan and pushed her hips hard at me and I smiled to myself as I drove my finger into her ass. She arched up from the bed and screamed and her body shook and trembled as she had a climax. 

By then my cock was hard again and I went to move up between her legs. She scrambled out from under me as she said: 

"No, let me do it." 

She swung over me and guiding my cock with her right hand she lowered herself onto my erection. As soon as I was in her she drove herself down hard on me taking me in as deep as she could and then she started riding me. She bounced up and down on me, going higher and coming down harder with each bounce. I was trying to time my upward thrusts to meet her downward pushes. I was trying to fuck her as she was fucking me and I was getting close to coming again. I wrapped my arms around her and rolled putting her under me and then I drove into her as hard and fast as I could. She cried out as she had an orgasm and I kept pounding as I tried to reach my own. 

Her heels were drumming on the backs of my legs and her nails were clawing at my back as she had another orgasm and then I felt the rush from my balls and I let go. I held myself inside her until I was limp and then I withdrew and fell to the bed beside her. 

"Damn" she moaned, "It was sure enough worth the wait." 

She rolled up on an elbow and looked down at me. "Have I driven the memory of losing Cathy from your mind?" 

"The memory of who?" 

I had my arms around her and we were cuddled up to each other and I was basking in the warm glow that comes with complete sexual satisfaction when Gloria said: 

"You do know what the deal with Cathy was all about don't you?" 

"From the way you ask the question I'm guessing that you already know that I don't." 

"Well, it was obvious to me that big sister wanted an incestuous relationship with her little brother, but was having a hard time making herself do it. The fake relationship was just her way of getting you into a situation where she could make it happen, but when she got you there she couldn't bring herself to go through with it." 

I was all set to say "bullshit" when I remembered Cathy taking her blouse off and reaching through my fly to grab my cock. 

"I think she is past it now, but I'd watch myself around her if I were you, especially at family parties where there is a lot of drinking going on." 

Then she paused a bit before saying, "Unless of course you are interested in helping the girl out. Are you?" 

"Of course not" I said, not knowing if I meant it or not. 

"Good" Gloria said, "I'm a one man woman and I expect my man to be a one woman man. Are you interested?" 

"Do you have an application I can fill out?" 

"That I do and you will be pleased to know that I do not ask for references." 

"Damn! And here I am with a briefcase full of letters praising my work." 

"That may be sweetie, but I am a firm believer in not taking anyone else's word for things. Speaking of firm," she said as she reached for my cock, "How we doing?" Report_Story
