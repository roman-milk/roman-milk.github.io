title: Darrel's Hole Card

#1 

===

I pulled into the lot and parked and as I got out of the car I thought back to the last time Hal told me he was running late and that I should drive to the hotel and meet him there. I had to smile as the events of that night came back to me vividly. 

+++++++++++++++++++ 

I was looking at myself in the full length mirror and thinking, "Not too bad for a thirty-six year old with three kids." Hal would not be ashamed to have me on his arm. I had the perfect 'little black dress' with the perfect sexy strappy high heels to go with it. The outfit was guaranteed to turn Hal on and their bedroom would be noisy tonight. Not that she would need the outfit to get him going. He had been gone for two weeks and if he was feeling half as horny as she did they might not even get out of the house to go to the company dinner. 

I was doing my hair when the call came. Terri, my sixteen year old daughter, called up the stairs: 

"Mom; its dad." 

I picked up the bedside phone, "Hi honey." 

"How's my little sexpot?" 

"Feeling sexy and horny and expecting you to do something about it." 

"I had hoped to be home early enough that we would both have a nice rosy glow when we got to the dinner, but it isn't going to happen. My flight has been delayed." 

"Oh shit!" 

"Not cancelled baby; just delayed a bit. What I need for you to do is go on to the dinner and I'll meet you there. The hotel is only twenty minutes from the airport, but it would take me an hour to get home and then another half hour to get from the house to the hotel. The dinner would be over before we got there. I'll call Darrel and get him to look after you until I get there. I should be there before the cocktail hour is over and the dinner starts." 

"I suppose I could do that, but there will be a price." 

"What?" 

"A building with rooms to rent, a two week absence, I'm horny as a goat and you have to ask what?" 

"Okay, okay; get a room. Can you get a baby sitter on such short notice?" 

"No need. Terri is old enough to ride herd on Jimmy and Norm. And we will only be half an hour away." 

"Okay baby; see you there. Love you." 

"Love you too sweetie. See you soon." 

++++++++++++++++ 

When I got to the hotel I stopped at the reception desk and rented a room for the night. I smilingly told the desk clerk that I didn't expect to be in any condition to drive when the party was over and the clerk smiled and said: 

"We get a lot of that." 

As I walked into the meeting room where the dinner was being held I heard a voice say: 

"Oh my God; would you look at that! Me want!" 

I gave no sign that I'd heard, but inside I beamed as I thought "You still got it girl." 

I saw Hal's boss Darrel at the same time he saw me and he got up and came over to me. 

"Hiya gorgeous. I guess I get to be your pretend date until Hal gets here. Too damned bad it's only pretend. You are looking hot tonight lady." 

"Why thank you sir." 

He led me over to the table where he was sitting and pulled out a chair for me to sit on. 

"Until Hal gets here you get to sit at the bachelor's table." 

I looked around and noticed that there were no other women at the table. I was a little nervous knowing that until Hal arrived I was going to be the center of attention. Besides Darrel there were five other men at the table. Three of them, besides Darrel, I knew from other company functions and two of those three were why I would be nervous. Sam and Phil were both a little on the crude side when they were sober. After a few drinks they got worse. Ben wasn't bad, but the take on Ben was that he was gay and just hadn't come out of the closet yet. 

Darrel introduced me to the two that I didn't know. Al was a marketing director for Excel and Bill was vice-president of Sales at Apollo. Darrel got me a drink and I sat there and made small talk with the men while I sipped my drink. 

I wasn't blind and I wasn't naïve. I could see the interest in the eyes of Al and Bill and I already knew about Phil and Sam. Both had crudely hit on me several times in the past. I'd never told Hal because he would have gone after them in a heartbeat and the resulting mess would not have done his career any good. 

Darrel bought me another drink and while Ben, Sam and Phil talked business Al, Bill and Darrel tried to keep me from becoming bored. I was on my fourth drink when it was time for dinner. I looked at my watch and wondered where Hal was. He'd said he would be there before the end of the cocktail hour. 

I had another drink with dinner and then one more during all the speech making that followed. Finally my cell phone rang and when I answered it Hal said: 

"By now you have noticed that I'm not there." 

"You didn't miss much. Same old rubber chicken and steak like boot soles. The speeches sounded just like last years. In fact they probably just dusted off last years and reused them." 

"I'm not going to make it tonight. The delay turned into a mechanical which turned into a cancellation. Soonest I can get out of here will be noon tomorrow. Sorry I got you down there for nothing." 

"It got me out of the house, but I'm not looking forward to being alone in a hotel room." 

"You don't have to stay. Go on home." 

"No thank you. Expecting you and not expecting to have to drive I've had several drinks and with the DUI crackdown that has been going on I'm not going to chance it." 

"Try to get plenty of rest because I'm not going to let you have any when I get home." 

"Promises, promises." 

"See you tomorrow baby. Love you." 

"Love you too honey. Dream of me." 

"I will. Bye." 

As I put the phone away Darrel asked, "Hal?" 

"Cancelled flight. Won't be home until sometime tomorrow afternoon." 

"Oh well, I knew my pretend date had to end sooner or later. You going home now?" 

"No. I've taken a room here for the night. Too many drinks to take a chance on driving." 

"That might be good news for me." 

"How would that be good news for you?" 

"It might mean that my pretend date with you isn't over yet. There is a pretty good band in the lounge. Maybe we could go have a few drinks and listen to them." 

"Why not. Since I won't be driving a couple more drinks won't hurt." 

We got up and moved to the lounge and I was surprised when Al and Bill followed along. We took one of the large booths and several minutes later Sam and Phil joined us. We ordered drinks and listened to the band and Darrel had been right – they were pretty good. 

It wasn't long before my foot was tapping and my fingers were drumming the top of the table in time to the music. Darrel noticed and asked me to dance and I was in the right mood to say yes. Darrel held me close and as we moved around the dance floor he said: 

"I'll have to thank Hal for this." 

"For what?" 

"Asking me to look after you. It isn't often I get to have a gorgeous woman like you in my arms." 

"Keep up the flattery and I might just keep dancing with you." 

The song ended and we went back to the booth and I ended up sitting between Bill and Darrel. A fresh drink arrived by then and after a few sips Bill asked me to dance. Then Al wanted a dance followed by Darrel again and of course Sam and Phil wanted a turn. And in between dances there were drinks. There always seemed to be a fresh one when I came back from the dance floor. I admit that I was drinking too much, but I was having a great time. I had five males doing their best to keep me happy and it didn't matter because I didn't have to drive and my room was only two floors up and minutes away. 

I wasn't the least bit naïve. I knew what they wanted. They wanted my hot tight body. They weren't going to get it, but I was the only one who knew that. I'd let them buy me drinks and dance with me and yes, push their hard cocks into my leg, but they were all going to end up the evening with blue balls. 

Sam and Phil were as crude as ever. During one slow number Sam was holding and holding his hard cock against me when he said: 

"When are you going to break down and give me a taste?" 

The answer was never, but I decided to have some fun and string him along. 

"Not until either you or Hal change jobs. Can't be doing you if you and Hal are working together." 

"So there is a chance?" 

"There is always a chance honey." 

Phil was even cruder. He was holding me tight against him and I could feel his bulge against my body when he said: 

"I want to fuck you and Hal isn't around so how about tonight?" 

I decided that with Phil I'd be just as crude as he was. "I only fuck men with ten inches or better." 

"Bullshit! I've seen Hal's dick in the locker room when we play racquet ball and he ain't got no ten inch cock." 

"I know. That's why I only fuck guys with ten or better. Why would I want to waste my time fucking guys the same size as my hubby?" 

"So you do fuck around?" 

I didn't, but he didn't know it. 

"Fuck AND suck honey." 

The music stopped and we went back to the booth. Me just a little unsteadedly because of all the drinks. The band announced that it was time for them to "take a pause for the cause" and said they would be back in fifteen. The seating in the booth kept changing as guys got up to go to the potty and when I came back from the dance floor I never ended up in the same place I was in when I left for the floor. This time when Phil and I got back Al, Bill and Darrel were sitting on one side and Sam was just coming back from the bathroom. Phil slid in and I sat next to him and Sam sat down on my right. I took a sip from the fresh drink in front of me. The drink was in my right hand and Phil leaned over and whispered in my ear as he took hold of my left hand: 

"Here's your ten incher sweetie." 

He moved my left hand over and held it against his hard cock. He had taken it out and it was jutting up out of his lap. He used his other hand to open my fingers and place my hand so it was around his cock. I couldn't get my fingers around it! I moved my head and glanced down and damned if it didn't look like ten inches. I sat there with a drink in my right hand and a dick in my left and wondered how I was going to get out of the situation without creating a scene. Then to add to my problems Sam put his left hand on my right leg and started inching it upwards. While Sam's hand crept up Phil was moving my hand up and down on his rigid pole. What I needed was to get out of the booth, but I couldn't use the bathroom as an excuse because I'd just gone before dancing with Phil. I had at least ten more minutes before the band would be back and someone could ask me – or I them – to dance. 

I took another long slug of my drink and set the empty glass down on the table just as the waitress brought us a fresh round. It was then that I noticed two things. One was that Phil was no longer holding my hand on his cock and moving it up and down. I was jacking him off on my own. The second thing was that Sam's hand had reached my crotch and the legs that I had been holding clamped closed to deny him access were wide open. The surprise was that once I noticed those things I did nothing to stop them. I kept stroking Phil and instead of using my right hand to reach down and stop Sam I used it to pick up my fresh drink. 

The first pull on the drink covered the gasp as one of Sam's fingers entered me. My mind and my body were not functioning together. The mind was busy trying to find a way to get out of the mess I'd gotten myself into, but my body was telling the mind to shut the fuck up. Two weeks without and being horny as hell the last three days along with the anticipation of what was supposed to happen when Hal got home that night had the body aching for attention and the body wanted the attention that it was getting. 

Sam's fingers had tingles running up and down my spine and my mind finally said: 

"Okay body; if that is what you want lets go for it." 

I was almost at the point where I was going to move over and sit on Phil's lap and let that hard ten inch pole travel up into me and fuck me while the other four men in the booth watched. Then – thank God – the band started playing and Darrel asked me to dance. I of course said I'd love to and I let go of Phil and started to slid out of the booth so Sam had to stop what he was doing. Once on the floor Darrel asked: 

"Are you alright? You look a little flushed." 

"Too many drinks I guess." 

"You want to call it quits for the night? I did tell Hal I'd look after you." 

Afraid of what might happen if I sat back down in the booth again I said that I'd better call it a night. When the song ended we went back to the booth and I picked up my purse and said goodnight to everyone and thanked them for a fun evening. I almost laughed when I saw the looks on the faces of Sam and Phil when I said that. They had been so sure that they had been home free. 

"I'll walk you to your room" Darrel said. 

"No need." 

"Oh yes there is. You are not too steady on your feet right now. You are my pretend date for the evening and I always walk my dates to their doors when I bring them home." 

When we got to my room he held out his hand and I handed him the key card. He swiped the lock and pushed the door open and I turned to thank him for the evening and when I did he took me in his arms and kissed me. He slipped me a little bit of tongue and I didn't fight it. He broke the kiss and said: 

"When I walk my dates to their doors, pretend dates included, I always kiss them goodnight." 

Our eyes met for a second and then he kissed me again and with a lot more tongue. Why I don't know, but I gave him some back. I honestly have no memory of what happened between my sending my tongue to play with his and finding myself looking up at him as he drove his cock into me, but there was no doubt that I was into it. My legs were clamped around him, my nails were dug into his ass and I was moaning "yes, yes, yes" as he pounded into me. I had a huge climax as he cried, "I can't hold it; I can't hold it" and I felt his hot splash inside me. I thanked God I was on birth control. 

Darrel kept thrusting even though his cock was going soft. He didn't want to stop and neither did I. I wasn't thinking of Hal or my kids just then; all I was thinking was "more, more, more." Darrel pulled out, spun around, and with me on top he went for my pussy with his mouth. I was looking down at his soft cock when his mouth found and locked onto my clit and I cried out and lowered my head and took his cock in my mouth. 

We worked feverishly on each other and his cock twitched a couple of times and then started to grow. Darrel's mouth worked on me and I rewarded him – and myself – with an orgasm. His mouth moved away and his cock speared into me again. I shoved my ass back at him to take him in deep and then suddenly, like a bucket of cold water had been thrown on me, my eyes shot open. How could he be pushing his cock in me while I still had it in my mouth? I lifted my head and looked over my shoulder and saw Bill's smiling face as he drove his cock into me. 

"How the hell did you get here?" I started to say and then a cock pushed into my mouth and hands grabbed my head. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Darrel stand up as he said: 

"I dropped your key card on the floor just outside the door so he could use it." 

"And aren't you glad he did?" Al asked as he fucked my mouth. With him holding my head in his hands and my mouth full I couldn't answer, but my body was screaming "yes, yes, yes" in unison with every stroke of the cock into my pussy. 

I was climbing the heights of another orgasm when Bill grunted and I felt the hot splash of his discharge in me. I cried out, "No, no, not yet, not yet, don't leave me hanging, please don't leave me hanging" but with my mouthful of Al it came out as an unintelligible mumble. I shouldn't have worried because no sooner was Bill was out of me than another cock slid in and a voice said: 

"Sweet Jesus; I have wanted this forever." 

It was Sam's voice and even though I couldn't see behind me because of Al's hands holding my head I knew that if Sam was in the room fucking me Phil was bound to be there also. Even as Sam's cock drove into me I was wondering what a ten inch cock was going to feel like. There were no thoughts about how wrong it was for me to be in a hotel room with five men; there was only my body crying out "more, more, more" and five cocks willing to give it to me. 

Sam must not have gotten any for a while and he came quickly. Al pulled out of my mouth and took Sam's place and then suddenly there it was right in front of my face. A ten inch cock. I stared at it and Phil laughed: 

"I know what you are thinking sweetie. You don't think that there is any way you can take it inside you, but you can. Trust me sweetie; you will take it all and you will love it." 

He leaned forward and I opened my mouth to receive him. 

Because of the time spent in my mouth Al didn't last long and Darrel took his place. While Darrel fucked me Phil just stood still and let me fuck his cock with my face. I could only get two or three inches of him in, but I tried and tried to get more. Darrel came and when he pulled out Phil said: 

"My turn now sweetie." 

He rolled me over on my back, lifted my legs up onto his shoulders and eased his monster cock into me. He started fucking me and I went nuts! Phil's ten inches touched places I don't think my gynecologist ever saw during my check ups. I cried, I begged and I screamed at him to never stop and Phil ate it up. 

"If I promise not to stop can I do your daughter?" 

"Yes damn you, yes. Fuck the little whore just don't stop fucking me." 

"Will you both carry my babies?" 

"I will if you just don't stop fucking me." 

"Can I be in your bed fucking you when Hal comes home?" 

"Yes damn you, yes. Just don't stop; please God don't stop." 

"Are you my bitch now?" 

"Yes, yes, your bitch. Fuck me, please, please fuck me." 

"I can have you any time I want?" 

"Oh God yes. Anytime, anywhere just don't stop" but of course he finally had to after he blew a load in me that I thought would force its way up into my throat. Even when he went soft he felt huge and I tied o keep him from pulling out. He laughed and said: 

"I'm not done yet sweetie; not by a long shot. Give me about ten minutes and I'll be back." 

He pulled away from me and Bill pulled me on top of him cowgirl. I pushed down on him and Sam got in position for me to suck his cock. I leaned forward and took it and a minute later he grabbed my head in his hands and held it and a second after that I knew why. I felt a cock pushing at my butt hole and Sam was keeping me from screaming "No!" It hurt like hell at first, but the pain eased off and pleasure started to take over as the three men used me. And then three more followed by three more. 

I have no idea how many loads were pumped into me or how many orgasms I had. I do know that Phil never got to use my butt and I found out later that it was only because Darrel, Al and Bill told him he couldn't and wouldn't let him. He did fuck me two more times and I was just as stupidly nuts those times as I had been the first time. Phil did tell me that the next time he was going to do my butt. Bill and Al were fucking me when I passed out exhausted. 

I woke up to find two men in bed with me. Bill on my right and Darrel on my left. A glance at the bedside clock told me that it was eight forty-five. I stared up at the ceiling and wondered how in the hell I would be able to face Hal after what I had just done. Shit!! He would be expecting sex when he got home and there was no way he wouldn't feel how loose I was and wonder why. What was I going to do? 

The answer to that question, at least in the near term, was given to me by Darrel. He felt me move and said: 

"Oh good; you're awake." 

He rolled over on top of me and was driving into me before I knew it and I was thinking "This is wrong, this is just so wrong. You need to stop it right now" but Bill was also awake and he said "Roll over" and Darrel rolled over to put me on top. My ass was loose and Bill pushed right into it with no trouble and when the two of them had a rhythm going I stopped thinking about anything but my next orgasm. They both came at about the same time and as Bill was washing his cock I was sucking Darrel's.  

===

When Bill came out of the bathroom he slid into my pussy and Darrel took my ass. They were working me hard when the room phone rang and I told them to stop. 

"It is probably Hal and I need to take the call." 

I picked up the phone. "Hello?" 

"Hi baby. Did I wake you?" 

"No. I've been up for maybe thirty minutes." 

"Sleep okay?" 

"About as well as can be expected when you are all alone in a hotel room." 

At the "all alone in a hotel room" Bill and Darrel 'high fived' and began to slowly fuck me. Nothing that would make my voice give away anything over the phone, but just a slow in and out. 

"I just wanted to let you know my flight leaves in ten minutes. I should be home around one-thirty. Can't wait to see you." 

"The same goes for me." 

"Got to go. I love you. Bye." 

"Love you too baby. Bye." 

I hung up the phone and snarled, "You bastards! Fuck me damn it; go ahead and fuck me." 

And they did. They swapped back and forth until ten-thirty when Darrel called a halt to things. Bill wanted to go one more time, but Darrel told him no which was good because I probably wouldn't have. 

"She has got to be home when Hal gets there and that means that she needs to shower and get going." 

Bill grumbled, but he dressed and left. He was no sooner out the door than Darrel had me on my back and was fucking me and I had my legs around him and was fucking back at him. We both came and then Darrel said: 

"You are one hell of a pretend date." 

"You going to let me move in with you when Hal tosses me out on my ass?" 

"Why would he do that?" 

"You have to be kidding me. He's been gone for two weeks. You think he isn't going to want to make love when he gets home?" 

"So fuck his brains out." 

"After what the five of you did to me last night? You don't think he won't know that something isn't kosher when he puts his cock into the loose sloppy hole you guys have given me? Fuck!!! I still don't know how it happened. I've never cheated on Hal and I've never wanted to. I've never even thought about another man let alone five." 

"Simple. We decided that we wanted you and kept filling you full of booze so your resistance was down and then we took you. You never had a chance. I knew when I saw you strut into the dinning room last night that you were on fire and ready to fuck. We both know it was supposed to be Hal, but when he called and said he wouldn't make it we decided that with some luck we could get you." 

"Yippie! It's good to know I'm an easy slut, but that still won't help me with Hal." 

"How close are you to your period?" 

"A couple of days." 

"Does it ever come early?" 

"Once in a while." 

"Then let this be one of those times. Does Hal ever make love to you when you are having your period?" 

"Never has yet, but I don't believe we have ever gone two weeks without making love before so I don't know what he might do." 

"Ever done anal with him?" 

"No. He thinks it is too dirty." 

"You mean....." 

"Yes indeedy. Last night was the first time." 

"So convince him that your period has started and then tell him that since you are both so horny that maybe you should try anal to relieve yourselves." 

"But I'm just as loose there." 

"Maybe, but if he has never done you there he won't know that it isn't your natural state. Or you could take care of him orally. You are extremely good at that by the way." 

"Oh gee thanks. That is just so good to know coming from someone not my husband." 

"Look babe; be as pissed as you want, but the bottom line is that you loved everything you did last night. It shone through. You spent most of the night begging and pleading for more and wanting it faster and harder. You got so into it with Phil that you told him that he could have both you and your daughter and you would both have his babies. At the same time." 

"I have to be pissed damn it! I've never cheated on Hal before. I never expected that I would. Did you stop to think when you did what you did that Hal might show up at your office with a gun looking to do bad things to you, Sam and Phil?" 

"He will never know." 

"Don't bet your life on it. Oh wait – you already have. I just might end up breaking down and confessing. I honestly have no idea of how I am going to be able to face the man and be able to look him in the eyes after last night." 

"Self preservation babe. You love him and don't want to lose him so you will suck it up and get on with life. Last night will just be a memory that you will keep to yourself. Right now all you have to do is convince him that your period came early." 

"Easy for you to say." 

"Yes it is. You use Kotex pads or tampons?" 

"Depends on the situation." 

"Just get whatever you use and stain it with some red food dye and when he sees it he will accept that you started. He might not be happy about it, but he will accept it. Now go take your shower before I get hard again and drag you back down on the bed." 

I reached for his cock as I said, "I'm going to have to go for a week or more without so I guess one more won't hurt. After all, I am a begging, pleading slut, right?" 

Hal did buy the early period story and wouldn't go along with trying anal which was a shame because now that I had done it I liked it. He did settle for head and – bless him for the thought – was sorry that he couldn't do something for me to relieve the hornies that he thought I still had. When my actual period was over – and Hal never did wonder why it was a bit longer than usual – we made up for lost time. I did actually try to fuck him to death as a way to ease the guilt I felt over the night at the company dinner. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

A month went by and I had pretty much put the night of the dinner behind me when I got a phone call from Darrel. He told me that he needed to talk with me about Hal and would I meet him for lunch. Hal was on a three day trip to Dayton so I asked Darrel if Hal was okay and Darrel said: 

"Yes and no. That's what we need to talk about and I don't want to do it from here on the phone. I don't want anyone to accidently overhear. Anton's at twelve?" 

He was sitting there waiting for me when I got there. He smiled as I came up to the table and leaned forward to kiss me on the cheek. I was going to lean away to prevent it, but at the last second I decided that it would be wise to go with the flow until I found out what Darrel wanted to talk about. He waited until after we ordered and then he said: 

"Bill Thomas will be in town tonight and he wants to see you." 

"Absolutely not! What the hell does this have to do with Hal?" 

"An awful lot as a matter of fact." 

"What the hell is going on Darrel? You told me we needed to talk about Hal, not Bill Thomas." 

"I'm guessing that Hal doesn't talk to you about work or you would know what Bill has to do with this. Bill is one of Hal's customers and Hal has been working on Bill to increase his business with us. Bill's company was giving us 20% of their orders and Hal was trying to get it up to 40 or even 50%. Al Meyers is another one Bill was working on. The night of the company dinner they were there because they had come to town to sign contracts that Hal had negotiated. Bill had upped his order to 35% and Al had decided to give us some of his business. After the night with you Bill agreed to change his contract from 35 to 60% if he could get another shot at you and Al said we could have all of his business if he could see you the next time he came to town. I told them they had a deal. 

"Hal doesn't know that of course; he thinks he did a hell of a sales job on the two and of course he did get a raise out of the deal and he did get the commissions even though you were the one who earned most of them. To be fair he did get Bill to go from 20% to 35 and he did get Al to commit for 25%, but it was you who took Bill from 35 to 60% and Al from 25% to all of his business." 

"And you got all that by promising them me? Where the fuck do you get off you fucking asshole. You meet Bill. Suck his dick and let him fuck your ass. Maybe if you do that he will let you keep his business." 

I started to get up and Darrel caught my arm and held up his cell phone and said: 

"Before you stomp off you had better look at this." 

One the screen was a video clip of Phil fucking me. 

"I don't have the speaker on so you can't hear it, but this is the part where you tell him he can have your daughter if he will just keep fucking you. I could be wrong, but I don't really think you would like Hal to see it." 

I sat back down, but if I would have had a gun I would have killed the son of a bitch where he sat and damn the consequences. 

"You need to know that all five of us took cell phone videos and pictures of you during the night and I have them all. There are no other copies. I worked out a deal with the other four and in exchange for all of their videos and pictures I agreed to see to it that they would all get to spend time with you. With Sam and Phil it wasn't easy because they are here in town and they wanted you right away, but I convinced them they needed to be patient until I could manage to set things up. It was easier with Bill and Al since they are from out of town. 

"I've waited until it was the right time to make my move and the right time is now. Bill will be here tonight and Hal is out of town. Your kids will be in school all day tomorrow so Bill can have you for most of the day. He wanted you all night, but I convinced him that you had to be home in case Hal called and he couldn't be there because of your kids. So. You will take care of Bill tomorrow and you will do it willingly and happily. He does not know that you are being blackmailed into it and you had better not let him find out. 

"Once you have taken care of Bill we will sit down and work out a schedule that will accommodate Phil, Sam and me. We will probably never have to worry about the looseness issue again because I doubt that the five of us will ever get together with you again although we had better, to be on the safe side, schedule Phil for times when Hal is out of town. Any questions?" 

"Yeah. How did you get to be such a low life bastard?" 

"It is all your fault." 

"Mine?" 

"Yes baby, yours. If you had not walked into that company dinner looking hot enough to fuck every hard cock in that room what happened probably wouldn't have, but it did and you loved every minute of it and if you doubt that I'll show you all the videos and pictures. You might have been high from all the alcohol that lowered your inhibitions, but you still loved every fucking second of it. By the time that evening was over every man in that room wanted you for his own. Every man in that room wanted to take you home with him and keep you for himself and himself alone." 

"Every man? Even you?" 

"Bet your magnificent ass sweetie. By the time I pulled my cock out of you for the last time and sent you off to shower I was ready to kill Hal just so I could get him out of the way and make you mine. As bad as it makes me sound every time he is on a trip I am hoping for a plane crash so I can move in on you. But back to what is going on here now. I am a company man. I have given my life to the company and when two huge customers say they will give me most of their business if I will just see to it that they can tap that sweet pussy of yours I am going to find a way to make it happen." 

"So now I am the company whore?" 

"Yes and no." 

"Yes and no? What does that mean?" 

"You are a whore for the five of us from the night of the dinner party and that is all." 

"Why do I have to do Sam and Phil?" 

"Because that is the only way I can keep a lid on things. I can't have them doing anything that might cause problems with Bill and Al. They have both been warned that I will fire both of their asses if they do anything to cause me to lose Bill and Al, That means they stay away from you except for when I schedule time for them. They are to do nothing that will give Hal anything to think about. Besides, given what I saw the last time you were with Phil I don't think you will mind spending time with him at all. My only worry is that his ten inch rod will have you agreeing to see him more often that I think safe. Face it sweetie; you did go nuts every time he did you. 

"In a way it is ironic. I've heard about wives who have fucked to get their husbands a raise or a promotion, but you are the first I know of who fucked her husband out of a promotion." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Hal was going to be made VP of Sales, but I can't give it to him now." 

"Why not? He's earned it." 

"That he has, but I need to keep him where he is for now. I need to be able to send him out of town when I need you to be free to take care of business." 

"You bypass him for VP and he might just say fuck you, quit and go somewhere else. He might even take his customers with him." 

"Not to worry. I'll just say that the economy is making me hold back on filling the position. I'll raise Hal's commission rate and see that he gets enough bonuses to keep him happy. All I need is for you to keep Bill and Al happy and Phil and Sam happy enough to not upset the apple cart." 

Darrel had me over a barrel and he knew it. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I did spend the next day with Bill and I did enjoy it. So much so that the next day I spent from nine until he had to leave for the airport with him. Two days later it was Sam from nine until noon and then the following Monday it was Darrel from nine until two. I was fucking Hal so much to assuage my guilt that I finally had to cut back to keep him from wondering why I was practically raping him every night. 

Darrel was right on the money where Phil was concerned. Phil was an asshole, but his ten inch cock made me sit up and beg. I went into every session with him determined to just fuck him and leave, but it never worked out that way. When he was in me he could get me to agree to anything as long as he would keep on fucking me. Fortunately it was only when he had those ten inches buried in me that I made those promises. When the session was over I could wait to get away from the slimy asshole. 

Sam was always a little on the crude side, but he always treated me like I was doing him the greatest favor in the world to even let him touch me. He was so sweet about it that once I even arranged to spend an entire night with him as long as he never let Phil or Darrel know about it. 

I had 'long lunches' with Darrel once a week and twice I spent all day with him when Hal was out of town. I did Bill and Al whenever they came to town which was usually every other month. Once they were in town at the same time Hal was out of town and I spent two days with them in threesomes. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Things went on that way for a little over a year and then changes started occurring. Al got married and surprisingly he wouldn't cheat on his wife. Cheating with me behind Hal's back was apparently all right, but things changed when he got a wife of his own. 

Bill's company was acquired in a hostile take over and I never saw him again. Fortunately Darrel's company had such a good record with Bill's company that Hal was able to negotiate an even better deal with the new owners including picking up some additional business from some of their other holdings. 

There was one other thing of note that took place. During one of my 'long lunches' with Darrel he asked me if I ever missed Bill and Al. If I had been at all smart I would have exclaimed "God no!" but for some stupid reason I was honest and said: 

"Yeah. Sometimes I do. Why?" 

"I'm sure that you have been expecting this to happen at some time so here goes. Would you consider spending a day with someone to help me get a contract?" 

He could see I was ready to go off on him and he quickly said, "No pressure sweetie. No blackmail. I'd like you to do it for me, but it has to be because you would like to. Saying no is an option." 

"Nice guy? Not an asshole?" 

"I think you might enjoy the day." 

"I'll think about it and get back to you. When?" 

"Next Wednesday." 

And so it was that at nine twenty Wednesday morning I knocked on the door of room 216 at the downtown Marriott and then spent the next five hours with the second largest cock that I'd ever seen. Jason had eight and a half very thick inches and did that man ever know how to use them. I enjoyed them more that Phil's ten because Jason's didn't come with all the bullshit that came with Phil's. The outcome of that Wednesday was that I saw Jason every time he came to town which was usually once a month. 

There was a second outcome of course. Once Darrel found out I was willing he began to ask me if I would mind seeing this customer or that client and more often than not I said yes. Yes indeed, I was the company whore and I was honest enough to admit to myself that I liked it. The only bad part was that the more sex I got the more I wanted and it killed me to have to force myself to keep my hands off of my husband. Hal and I had a great sex life and we went at it an average of four times a week and that was after eighteen years of marriage. Some of those nights we went more than once or even twice, but I had heard that one of the signs of a cheating wife is that she either cuts back on sex with hubby or increases it. So even though I wanted more I had to limit the man I loved to what he was used to getting and that sucked! 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

As I left the reception desk after getting a room for the night I wondered what the night held in store for me. As had happened the last time Hal had said that Darrel would look after me until he got there. I walked into the banquet room and in the immortal words of Yogi Berra. "It was déjà vu all over again. I saw Darrel at the same time he saw me and he got up and came over to meet me. Behind him at the table he had been sitting at I saw Phil, Sam and instead of Bill and Al I saw two men I'd never seen before and I knew as sure as god made little green apples what my night was going to be like if for some reason Hal didn't show up. 

And I smiled at the thought. Report_Story
