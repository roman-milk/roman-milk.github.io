The Black Hat
=============
#1 

===

I stop at the same restaurant for breakfast four or five days a week and for lunch maybe twice. There are a lot of regulars that frequent the place and I don't know half of them even though I've seen most of them off and on for the last fifteen years. It was a case of 'you know who they are but you don't know them.' You see them often enough to nod at them and say "Good morning" but it rarely goes any farther than that. 

You see them often enough to observe their character traits and idiosyncrasies and some of them can be pretty entertaining to watch. There is the cop who comes in and sits in the same booth every day. If he comes in and some one else is sitting in that particular booth he will sit at the counter even if there are other booths and tables empty and drink coffee and read the morning paper until "his" booth becomes available and then he will move to it and order his breakfast. I've seen him sit at the counter for almost an hour waiting for that booth. 

Then there is the guy who comes in and drinks coffee while watching for some one who is reading a newspaper to get up, pay their bill and go leaving their paper behind then he is up like a shot to get that paper. He will not order his breakfast until he has someone else's newspaper to read while he eats. 

A guy named Al has come in every morning for the last nine years and he orders the same thing every morning (at least he does on the mornings I'm there). He orders two pancakes and a side of bacon. When the pancakes come he lifts off the top one and smothers the bottom one with catsup and Tabasco sauce and then puts the top one down and covers it with jelly instead of syrup. Every day for nine years! 

There is a man named Toby who owns two apartment buildings and who comes in every morning and goes from booth to booth and table to table sitting down and saying "Hi" to everyone while waiting for someone to offer to buy him a cup of coffee. 

There is a woman named Alice who works at city hall and who comes in once or twice a week wearing low cut blouses, high heels, short skirts and no underpants. She always sits at a table where she can be seen by a good half of the people in the restaurant and then she sits down and spreads her legs wide so everyone can see what she has. Guys who think it is a 'come on' and who have approached her get hot coffee thrown in their laps. Jerry Anderson, who also works at city hall says that when Alice gets to work she changes into long dresses or slacks. I guess she must get off on teasing a whole room full of guys. 

There are dozens more, but the one who changed my life was Jeff Standish. Jeff never did anything to call attention to himself unless you want to call wearing a hat an attention getter. Then again, I guess that it was. It did get my attention. 

Jeff always wore a hat and it was always the same hat. A black, wide brimmed Stetson - what some call a 'cowboy hat.' Tank top and cutoffs and the black hat. Jeans and a tee shirt and the black hat. Suit and a tie and the black hat. Jeff rode a racing bike and he wore those dumb looking skin tight Speedo things that bike riders wear and he came into the restaurant one day wearing them and the black hat. You get the picture? If you saw Jeff you saw the black hat. It got to the point where you automatically checked out Jeff when he came in to see if that was the day he came in hatless, wearing a baseball cap or some other style of head gear. 

Whatever -- this whole ramble is only to point out why I was always checking out Jeff. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was a Wednesday and I walked into the restaurant and saw Jeff sitting in a booth towards the back. No change, still the black hat. He was talking to some one I couldn't see since whoever it was was sitting lower down than the back of the booth. I saw John and Mike sitting at the large round table against the back wall so I joined them. When I sat down I was facing the front door and I was able to see who was sitting with Jeff. A super-fine, very hot looking blonde! 

As I sat there drinking coffee and talking to John and Mike while waiting for Tiffany to bring me my steak and eggs I kept glancing over at Jeff's booth. No -- not true -- I was looking over at the blonde. You ever see some one, know that you know them from somewhere, but just can't quite pin down from where? That's what I was getting from the blonde. She was vaguely familiar. I knew, just knew I'd seen her somewhere and try as I might I could not remember where or when. And that was very disquieting because there was no way on God's Green Earth that I should have ever forgotten something that smoking hot! 

John and Mike left and shortly after Jeff and the blonde got up to leave and I got a good look at the total package. Five two and maybe a hundred and five pounds. Nice tits and a fantastic ass. Long blonde hair down to the middle of her back; all in all one hot looking babe. I finished my breakfast, had one more cup of coffee and then I headed off to work. 

Friday morning I was sitting in the restaurant when Jeff came in and my eyes automatically went to his head. I saw that nothing had changed; he still had on the black hat. He sat down at a table and about five minutes later the blonde came in and sat down with him. I wondered about that. Outside of the fact that I just knew that I knew her from somewhere I knew that Jeff was gay so what was the story behind the stone fox sitting with him. I sipped and kept looking at the blonde until it was time for me to head off to the salt mine. 

It was Tuesday before I went back to the restaurant. As I parked I saw Jeff getting out of his pick up and I checked him out -- still wearing the black hat, Ten minutes after Christy put my breakfast down in front of me the blonde came in and joined Jeff. When Christy brought me my ticket I asked her if she knew who the blonde was. 

"That's Candy, Jeff's sister." 

"No way!" 

"Way. Big change huh?" 

"I'll say." 

Suddenly I knew why the blonde had looked familiar and why I couldn't believe I couldn't remember a girl that drop dead gorgeous. The last time I had seen Candy had been about three years previous and she had been -- to put it bluntly -- fat! Imagine five two and two hundred and twenty-five plus pounds and you had the Candy I remembered. Oh well, mystery solved and I had one less thing bouncing around in my head and bugging me. 

+++++++++++++ 

But it didn't end there. For some reason, known only to Christy and God, Christy started to tease me. I came in for breakfast one morning and Christy said: 

"You just missed your girlfriend." 

"Who?" I asked a little on the confused side since I didn't have a girl friend. 

"Candy. She just left and she was looking good this morning." 

Instead of shrugging and going to a table I said, "Damn! Of all the bad luck" and that got the ball rolling. From then on Christy would tease me about Candy. 

"Your girlfriend was in this morning. You just missed her." 

"Candy was in this morning with some guy. You might be losing her." 

"Candy was in this morning. She was sitting alone in a booth and she looked sad. Too bad you weren't here. You could have sat with her and cheered her up." 

One morning I had just finished my breakfast when Christy came up to me and told me to hurry up and pay my bill. 

"Why?" 

"Because we are full and Candy just got here and she needs a seat so come on, let's go." 

I pointed at the empty seat across from me and said, "Bring her over. I'll share." 

"Up Rob, come on, let's go. You know you need to get to work anyway." 

Candy was watching the play-by-play from over by the register and when I got up and left I had to walk right by her. She smiled at me and said, "Thank you." 

"No need to thank me. Christy threatened me. She told me if I didn't get up she would do bad things to my breakfast the next time I came in." 

That was the first time I'd ever spoken to Candy. Up till then she was just another one of the regulars you saw and just nodded a hello to. 

Maybe six months went by and when I'd come into the restaurant Christy would tell me that I had just missed Candy and I would scold her for not calling me at work so I could hurry on down. Or she would tell me that Candy had just left and that she was looking super fine that morning and I would accuse her of just saying that to tease me. Once she said: 

"Candy is on the other side" -- (there was a wall between the two sides of the restaurant) -- "and she is alone. Could be your big chance." 

I looked at my watch and said, "Damn the rotten luck. I'm running late and I need to get to work. Story of my life; another opportunity lost." 

++++++++++++++++++ 

And then one morning I racked it up a notch. I saw Jeff come in (and yes - - still the black hat) with a wrapped present and a dozen roses in a vase. He handed the present to Christy and she took it somewhere in the back. It was common knowledge that Jeff was gay, but he never flaunted it in public so I discounted that he was meeting his lover for breakfast. I called Christy over and took a shot in the dark. 

"Is today Candy's birthday?" 

"Yep, and she should be here any moment now." 

"I want you to do me a favor. After they eat and ask for the bill just tell Candy that it has been taken care off. Tell her that her secret admirer bought her breakfast. I'll settle up with you when I come in tomorrow. Just don't tell her who her secret admirer is, okay?" 

"Oh yeah. I can do that. It will be a kick." 

The next day Christy said, "When Jeff asked me for the ticket I told him that Candy's secret admirer had already taken care of things and had asked me to wish her a very Happy Birthday. Then Candy said, "A secret admirer? Who?" and she started looking around. I told her I promised not to say and pointed out that if she knew who it wouldn't be a secret. Then Jeff got up to use the bathroom and while he was gone Candy said, "Come on, tell me. I won't let him know that I know." I told her sorry, but I had promised. Then she said, "Don't do this to me Christy; I just have to know." I just shrugged and told her I had other customers I had to get to and I walked away. Until Jeff got back from the bathroom Candy looked at every guy in the place trying to figure out who paid for her breakfast." 

I thought for a minute and then said, "Do me another favor. Every once in a while when she comes in tell her that she just missed her secret admirer and if she is here when I'm here let her know that her secret admirer is in the building. Just don't ever let her know that it is me." 

"You are an evil person Rob." 

"Oh no you don't. You are the one who started all of this with the "You just missed your girlfriend stuff." 

For the next couple of months Christy did just what I asked her to do. I would come in and Christy would tell me that I just missed Candy and that she had told Candy that she had just missed me. 

"You are driving that poor girl nuts Rob. She is even trying to bribe me." 

Maybe a half dozen times I was in the restaurant when Candy was there and Christy would say something to her when she refilled Candy's coffee cup or set her breakfast down in front of her and Candy would start looking around the room. I always made sure that I wasn't looking her way when she did it. 

++++++++++++++ 

Why, since I thought she was smoking hot and she wanted to know who I was, didn't I tell Christy to let Candy know who I was and then try and get something going with Candy? Because I was married and I was pretty sure that Mary Alice would take a dim view of my chasing after another skirt. Although I wondered why she would. Things had not been going all that great between us for quite a while. It seemed like everything that I did and every thing I said would tick Mary Alice off. It was so bad that I found myself volunteering for projects that would keep me at work late so I wouldn't have to go home. I even did some volunteer work for a couple of charities. Anything to keep from going home until late. 

Our love life was non-existent. It had been over six months since our last time. I was actually considering paying for some sex. Dawn Marie, one of the girls I went to school with, lost her husband in Iraq and with three small children to take care of she was up against it. She supplemented her meager income with a little 'light hooking' on the side. She didn't take just anyone; she had to know you and trust you and I was pretty close to giving her a call. 

But even though things weren't all that great between Mary Alice and myself I wasn't anywhere near ready for a divorce and that is where I would be headed if Mary Alice caught me chasing after Candy. 

One morning I came into the restaurant and saw Candy sitting alone and on a whim I told Christy that I would cover Candy's tab and she could tell Candy that her secret admirer had taken care of it. I watched as Candy asked for her ticket and then I saw her rise up and scan the room twice before getting up and leaving. When Christy brought me Candy's ticket she asked: 

"You are an evil man Rob. Are you ever going to let the poor girl know?" 

"Of course not. If she found out I couldn't be a secret admirer any more now could I?" 

++++++++++++++++++ 

Christy and I played the game for another month and then things changed and they changed radically. Two things happened in close succession. The first thing that happened was that I discovered why Mary Alice and I weren't getting along. 

The company set me up to make an 'on site' visit to one of our customers. I was supposed to fly out on a Monday and return Thursday. Sunday I packed my bag and Monday morning I told Mary Alice I'd give her a call and let her know where I was staying when I got to St. Louis and checked into a hotel and then I headed off to work. 

The plan was to leave for the airport at one, but at eleven Harry (my boss) called me into his office and told me that he wanted me to put off the trip for a day. Engineering thought that they had come up with a fix for one of the problems I was going to the site to inspect and Harry wanted me to have the fix when I went. I finished out the day at the office and then headed for home. I didn't bother to call Mary Alice since lately she hadn't seemed to much care about anything where I was concerned anyway. 

I knew what was going on as soon as I walked into the house. I heard the long, drawn out wailing moan that Mary Alice makes when she is taking a hard one in the ass. That sound explained what had been going on and why Mary Alice had been so distant the last six months or so. The big surprise wasn't that Mary Alice was an unfaithful bitch -- although that was a surprise -- but that I didn't much care. Sixteen years together and for all practical purposes it was over. And I didn't care! 

But I was curious though and so I quietly climbed the stairs and headed for the bedroom. Mary Alice was on her knees, head lying on her arms as she moaned and behind her, driving up the dirt road, was Herb Sampson. Herb was our next door neighbor. Neither one saw me as I stood there taking in the scene and after maybe half a minute I turned and left. 

I checked into a motel for the night and then in the morning I went into the office to pick up what the engineers had for me. While at the office I got out the Yellow Pages and looked up Investigative Services. I called the first one on the list, which happened to be AAA Investigations, and after giving them some information and a credit card number I headed for St. Louis. 

The fix the engineers had come up with worked and that made the visit a little easier for me. I had time in my hotel room to think about the situation I found myself in. I was still surprised that I hadn't been more upset at finding out about Mary Alice and Herb. I had known for months that there was something bad wrong with our relationship, but I was thinking that it might have been menopause or something like that that she would eventually get over. But it no longer mattered whether or not she got over it, because I wouldn't be getting over what she was doing with Herb. All I needed to do was figure out what I was going to do about it. 

I spent Tuesday and Wednesday night wrestling with the problem and in the end I decided to do nothing. Oh I did make some decisions. One was that sex with Mary Alice was a thing of the past. And I decided that I wasn't going to waste money on a divorce. Why bother? Mary Alice cooked a decent meal, kept a clean house and I always had clean socks and underwear. We weren't having sex anyway so no loss there. For the last year she wasn't much more than a maid or house keeper anyway so why not keep it that way was my thinking. Eventually Mary Alice might decide to go for a divorce and against that possibility I would have AAA Investigations get as much dirt on Mary Alice as possible so she wouldn't be able to rape me too bad. The third decision I made was to pay a call on Dawn Marie when I got back home. 

I flew home Thursday, dropped by the office and brought Harry up to date on my trip and then I headed for my office. I called Dawn Marie and asked her if she would like to have dinner with me that evening and she said she would love to. I told her I would pick her up at six and then I called Mary Alice on my cell phone and told her that there had been some complications and that I wasn't going to get home until Friday. As I hung up I could just imagine how fast she got in touch with Herb to let him know that they had one more night together. 

Dawn and I had dinner at Antonio's and then I asked her if she would like to hit a club for a drink or two and a dance or three and her face lit up. 

"Oh God Bobby, do you have any idea how long it has been since I've gone dancing? I'd love it." 

Dawn Marie was a great looking girl and she would make some lucky guy a great wife if she could find one willing to take on a woman with three kids aged seven, five and three. Unfortunately there didn't seem to be many of those around. Of course he would also have to be open minded enough to overlook what she did to pay her bills. 

Dawn Marie didn't start out a loose woman, but when Hal didn't make it back from Iraq she found herself in a bind for money. The insurance didn't last long and day care would eat up whatever she would make going back to work. Six months after Hal's death Charlie Profitt felt that she had been in mourning long enough and he had asked her out. She said that she wished she could go out, but she couldn't afford a baby sitter. Charlie told her that he would cover the sitter. During the date it came out just how bad off she was. It had been over a year since Dawn had made love and Charlie was able to score. Before he left he handed Dawn a hundred dollar bill and she said that she couldn't take it and Charlie had said: 

"Oh yes you can. Think of what you can buy for your kids with it" and that was the start of it. 

We spent three hours at The Pit and then I took her to a motel. I can't speak for Dawn, but I enjoyed the hell out of it. So much so that I asked her if we could make it a standing date to do the same thing every Thursday from then on and she said yes. I took her home and then went back to the motel and got a good night's sleep. 

Friday afternoon I sat in the offices of AAA Investigations and listened as they described Mary Alice's activities while I was in St. Louis. Tuesday night Herb spent the night at my house. Mary Alice spent Wednesday night at Herb's and Thursday night Herb over-nighted at my place. I made arrangements to let some of AAA's people into the house to plant some surveillance equipment and then I went home to my "loving wife." When I got home Mary Alice acted like she hadn't even known I had been gone. The rest of the weekend was normal except that I made no attempt to try and talk Mary Alice into making love. Not that she would have anyway, but it was something that I usually did. I wondered if she even noticed that I didn't bother.

+++++++++++++++++++ 

The second thing that happened was that I was discovered. It was the Tuesday after I returned from my St. Louis trip. I was sitting at the restaurant having lunch when Candy came in. She looked my way, saw me, and her face lit up with a smile. "What's up with that" I thought and then she headed straight for my table. As I stood up and pulled out a chair for her I looked around and noticed several empty booths and tables. Once she was seated she said: 

"And how is my secret admirer today?" 

"I guess it is just plain admirer now. Who snitched?" 

"Nobody sweetie. Believe it or not, but just because I'm blond doesn't mean that I'm dumb. Every time Christy would tell me that my secret admirer was here I would look around and I noticed that you were the only one who was here all those times. Simple process of elimination. Plus, the last time you bought my breakfast I just happened to look in the window when I got outside and I saw Christy bring you the bill." 

"I guess that puts an end to my fun." 

"Maybe. Maybe not. There is fun and then there is another kind of fun." 

Before I could ask her what she meant by that Martha showed up to take Candy's order. After Martha left Candy changed the subject and said: 

"You already know I'm Candy, but who are you? All the waitresses here call you something different. Christy calls you Rob, Tiffany calls you Bobby, Kit calls you Bob and Martha calls you Mister Dalton." 

"I prefer Rob, but I have been known to answer to "Hey you." 

"Hey you? I like that. So tell me Hey You, what do you do?" 

We spent the next twenty minutes making general conversation while eating and then it was time for me to get back to work. As I was getting ready to go Candy opened her purse, took out a card and handed it to me. 

"I always have my cell with me. Call me. Soon." 

I smiled at her and said, "I would really love to. Really, I would, but I'm married." 

"That doesn't make you all bad, just more interesting. Call me." 

As I walked out of the restaurant I was thinking, "If she doesn't care if I'm married I sure don't." I waited until four that afternoon and then I called her and asked her to have dinner with me on Wednesday and she said she would love to. 

When I got home that night I told Mary Alice that I had to go to St. Louis again the next day and wouldn't be home until Friday. All she said was: 

"Don't forget we have my sister's birthday party to go to on Saturday." 

I didn't have a trip to St. Louis, but AAA suggested that I fake one so they could get Mary Alice and Herb on tape. Given what the two had done while I was on my last trip it was a considered a good bet that either Wednesday or Thursday, or maybe both, the two of them would spend the night again at my place. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I had a great time with Candy on Wednesday night and when I took her home and walked her to her door I told her that I had enjoyed myself immensely and that I would like to do it again. She laughed as she unlocked her door and then she turned to me and said: 

"It isn't over yet Hey You" and she took hold of my tie and pulled me into her condo. 

She was wild, she was hot and she lived up to the promises that her super sexy appearance made. It was an exhausting three hours and when I couldn't respond any more and was lying next to her trying to recover Candy asked: 

"What time do you have to be home?" 

"I don't. I'm away on a business trip tonight." 

"Oh lucky me. I hope that you like being awakened with a blow job." 

"I probably could learn to like it." 

She did wake me up with a hum job and that led to a spirited romp followed by us showering together. As I dressed Candy asked: 

"Any chance you will still be out of town on business tonight?" 

"Unfortunately I'll be back. I have something scheduled for tonight." 

"Some one whose eyes I might want to scratch out?" 

"No, it is a business meeting." 

"When can I see you again?" 

"How about tomorrow night." 

"That will work for me." 

As I drove to work I wondered why I was passing up free pussy from Candy just to pay for some from Dawn, but even as I asked myself that question I knew the answer. I had committed myself to seeing her and I knew that she was depending on the money so she could take care of her kids. She was expecting me and because of it she may have turned down another caller and I didn't think it would be right of me to call and cancel now. 

At ten I called AAA and was told that Herb had spent both nights at my place and it was all on tape. I swung by AAA at lunch and picked up their reports and the audio and video tapes and then I stopped by the bank and rented a deposit box to hold them. I'd already decided that I wasn't going to go for a divorce, but what was in the box was my insurance policy in case Mary Alice decided to bail and clean me out in the process. 

I picked up Dawn at six and we had dinner, took in a movie and then stopped at The Black Mushroom for a couple of drinks and some dancing. Once in the motel room Dawn moved into my arms and whispered: 

"Hold me Bobby. Hold me and kiss me and let me pretend that this isn't just another business transaction." 

The way she said it touched me and made me realize just how bad life had stuck it to her. That night I didn't fuck her; I did my best to make love to her. When I took her home she kissed me and asked: 

"Next week?" 

I kissed her again and told her I would be there. On the way back to the motel I felt like a heel. Dawn deserved a better life than what she had and I wasn't making it any better for her by acting like I wasn't just another trick. 

++++++++++++ 

I called Mary Alice from work on Friday and told her that I was back from my trip, but would be home late since Harry wanted to take me out to dinner and discuss what had occurred when I visited the client. I didn't expect her to say anything and she didn't disappoint me. 

I picked Candy up and we went for dinner and then dancing. In the car on the way to her apartment Candy asked: 

"What's the story with you Hey You? Wife doesn't understand you?" 

"I think in my case that is a true statement. She sure didn't understand me well enough to know that I wouldn't take kindly to finding out that she was cheating on me with the next door neighbor." 

"When did you find out?" 

"Three weeks ago." 

"So I'm just a revenge fuck?" 

"Not in the least. Mary Alice and I hadn't had a sex life for quite a while and all that finding out what she as doing with Herb was free me up to do some playing of my own. Until I caught her I was staying faithful even though the marriage was floundering." 

"What did she say when you caught her?" 

"She doesn't know. They were too busy to notice me and I turned and walked away." 

"So I caught you at just the right time." 

"Indeed you did and I'm glad of it. Okay, now that you know my story what's yours? Why did a stone fox who has every man who sees her drooling sit down at a married man's table and give him what was basically an engraved invitation?" 

"Busy playing catch-up and I thought I would give my secret admirer a try." 

"Playing catch-up?" 

"You have been around long enough to know what I looked like five years ago. You have to know that I couldn't get a date and that I had zip for a love life at the time. Anyway, after an extreme diet and a personal trainer got me into the shape I am in now I've started making up for lost time and I've been busy sampling what is out there. I'm looking for the keeper. Would that maybe be you Hey You? Are you a keeper?" 

"Apparently Mary Alice didn't think so." 

"One woman's loss can be another woman's gain. So far I like what I see. What time do you need to be home tonight?" 

"When I get there." 

"Oh goody. Plan on being very, very late." 

It was three in the morning when I got home and Mary Alice didn't wake up when I climbed into bed. 

Saturday was a busy day for me as I tried to catch up on the yard work. I had cut the grass and was busy pulling weeds out of the flower beds when Herb leaned over the fence and said: 

"Hey Rob; long time no see. How have you been?" 

"Busy busy busy Herb. Between the job and keeping up with what's going on around here I don't have much free time." 

"Come on over and have a beer." 

"I'd like to, but I have to get this done before Mary Alice and I have to go over to her mom's place to celebrate her sister's birthday." 

Besides, I thought, a beer might loosen me up enough to do you some serious bodily harm. 

"Well, offers open if you can find some time" and he walked back to his garage. I wondered what the fuck Mary Alice saw in him. Maybe it was a case of "birds of a feather." He was divorced because his wife caught him cheating. Maybe they got along because he was a cheater and she wanted to cheat. I got back to my weeding. 

The birthday party for Angela was mostly family. I always got along good with Mary Alice's family. They were all nice people and they all seemed to like me. I was out on the back patio looking up at the stars when Angie came out and stood beside me. We stood there silent for a moment or two and then she said: 

"What's up with you and Mary Alice?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Oh come on Rob, the two of you are acting toward each other like you are each living on a different planet." 

So I wasn't the only one who noticed that Mary Alice didn't connect with me any more. I considered my answer for a bit and then said: 

"I don't know Angie. Maybe it's my job. I've been putting in a lot of hours lately and maybe Mary Alice is feeling left alone too much. Can't be helped though. Got to pay the bills." 

"Maybe you need to find a way to spend more time with her." 

I almost laughed at that. Find a way to spend more time with her? I was trying like hell to find ways to keep me away from her. 

Mary Alice was in a good mood on the way home and when we got there and were getting ready for bed Mary Alice said: 

"Rob honey, it has been a while since we made love. Are you in the mood?" 

I wasn't all that interested, but to say no would not be natural. And then I thought so what? She had been saying no to me for months. I almost said, "If you are horny go and see Herb" but I didn't, I just said: 

"No thanks Mary Alice, I'm not in the mood." 

I saw her face cloud up a little at that, but she didn't say anything. She just put on her nightgown, got in bed and turned out the lamp on her side. 

Over breakfast in the morning Mary Alice kept looking at me and finally she put her coffee cup down and said: 

"Why didn't you want to make love to me last night?" 

The first thing that leapt into my mind was, "Because I don't want Herb's leftovers" but what I said was: 

"It has been over six months since the last time. I've tried, but all I've gotten was excuses. Headaches, backaches, whatever, and I've gone through withdrawal. I've managed to get myself to the point where I don't miss it and quite frankly I didn't want to do it with you and then go through another six months of withdrawal again." 

"That isn't natural Rob. Men always want sex. Are you getting it some place else?" 

"Funny you should ask that Mary Alice. That is exactly what I've been wondering about you. Wondering if the reason you haven't been interested in having sex with me all these months is because you have a lover. One of the neighbors maybe? Some one close by to take care of you while I'm busy working my ass off to pay for this house you just had to have and all the other things you've wanted." 

Her face lost a little color when I said that and she said, "Don't be ridiculous." 

"Yeah. It does sound a little far fetched doesn't it." 

I got up from the table, refilled my coffee cup and went out to the garage to work on the car. I spent the day working on projects around the house, had a rather silent meal at dinner time and then watched some TV until around ten Mary Alice was already in bed sleeping when I got to the bedroom. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Over the next month I co-existed with Mary Alice, spent every Thursday night with Dawn Marie and dated Candy two or three times a week. The more time I spent with Candy and the more I learned about her the more I thought back to the night she told me she was looking for a keeper and then asked me if I was one. The more I learned about her the more I was thinking that she was one -- a keeper. 

I began to seriously consider ending the farce with Mary Alice and then putting a full court press on Candy. One Wednesday night after Candy and I had worked up a major sweat I asked he if she had made any progress in finding her keeper. 

"Actually I have. I'm just waiting for him to make his move." 

"Am I in the way?" 

"You men can be so dense sometimes." 

"Why would you say that?" 

"Because my "keeper" is in my bed right now." 

"Oh." 

"Yes Hey You, oh." 

"What is it that makes you think that I am a keeper?" 

"We may have tripled in size over the last ten years Rob, but for all of us born here this is still a small town and word gets around. I know all about you. I have a cousin who works with you and he tells me that you are a hard worker and are well thought of by upper management. A girl I went to school with is involved with the same charity to that you volunteer to work with. She has the hots for you by the way. I know dozens of people who know you and they all say that you are the real deal. Some of them even know that things aren't right between you and your wife and they know, or at least feel, that the problem is with her but you still soldier on and do your best. So I know what kind of man you are Hey You and as an added bonus you are absolutely marvelous in the sack." 

"I'm not too clear on socially acceptable behavior. Can I propose to you now or do I have to wait until my divorce is final?" 

"I think the wise thing to do would be for me to accept your proposal, fuck your brains out as a sign of commitment and then keep our plans quiet until your divorce is final" and then she did the commitment thing. 

+++++++++++++++++ 

Mary Alice was a little stunned when I handed her the divorce papers. 

"I don't understand Rob. Why are you doing this to me -- to us?" 

"There is no us Mary Alice, there is you and Herb." 

"Oh God, you know." 

"Yes Mary Alice, I know and I have audio, video and the reports from the private detectives to back them up. Don't bother with the "It isn't what you think" or the "I can explain" or the "He means nothing to me, it was only sex" routine because none of it matters. How it started, why it started and how long it has been going on don't mean a thing to me. The only thing that means anything is what I saw with my own two eyes when I came home one night when you thought I was out of town. All that matters is the time I spent standing in the bedroom doorway watching Herb fuck you in the ass. You were so into it that neither one of you even noticed I was there. 

"The bright side to all this is you can spend all your time with Herb now although he isn't likely to be much use in the sex department for a while. I stopped off to give him the good news and I'm afraid I got a little carried away when I was kicking him in the balls. Nine times might have been a bit excessive." 

I looked down at my shoes and said, "Messed up my shine too. Hey! Maybe you can run over to his place and try to kiss things and make them better. Maybe you can do that while I pack." 

I left her standing in the living room as I headed for the basement to get suitcases. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

She held my hands on her huge belly and I felt him kick. We knew it was a him because we had an ultrasound done. 

"Your hands on my tummy are making me horny." 

"Everything makes you horny." 

"Yes, and you seem to think that it is a good thing. You certainly take advantage of the condition often enough." 

"You are right and I think I'll do it again" I said as I stood up and undressed. She giggled and got on her hands and knees. Doggie was the only way we could do it with her being in the condition she was in. Not that I minded. There was something that was just so terribly erotic in the way she looked with her belly and milk filled tits hanging down. Nasty old man me had even taken a video of us making love in the position and watching the belly and tits sway were a major, major turn on. 

I slid slowly into her and then made slow love to her while she moaned. She had an orgasm and then I had mine. 

"Thank you lover; I needed that" she murmured as she laid down on her right side and I moved in behind her and spooned up against her. 

In the morning as Dawn -- yes, Dawn -- fixed breakfast and got the kids ready for school I watched her bustle around the kitchen and thought about how I had ended up where I was. 

It had started on a Thursday at a TGI Friday's in Colorado Springs. I was visiting a customer and he offered to take me to lunch. It was one week after the "commitment fuck" and three days after I had dropped the divorce papers on Mary Alice. Marv and I were sitting at a window table when I saw a familiar looking pick up truck pull into the parking lot of the Days Inn just across the street. The driver had his cell phone in his ear and I saw him drive by the office and pull up and park next to a familiar looking Lexus. Marv asked me what had my attention and without taking my eyes off of the two vehicles I said: 

"I'm not sure Marv, but I think my wedding plans are about to become history." 

The door to the Lexus opened and Candy got out and walked to the door of the unit she was parked in front of, unlocked the door and went inside. The man got out of the pick up and followed her into the room and the door closed. I'd know that black hat anywhere. It would seem that Jeff wasn't as gay as every one thought. I didn't have to wonder why they were in Colorado Springs. Candy herself had told me that Castle Rock was still a small town and word gets around. So there I sat, looking out the window. Mary Alice was history and Candy was about to be. 

I was in a bit of a funk when I got off work that evening and all I really wanted to do was go somewhere and get pissy-assed drunk, but I had my standing date with Dawn Marie. And let me say this up front. If it had been anyone but Jeff going into that motel room with Candy the wedding would still have been on. I was still married to Mary Alice and Candy was a single lady and what she did before we got married was really none of my business. I would have brought it up and we would have talked about it, but it would not have derailed anything. Besides, I could hardly be pissed at her while I was still seeing Dawn, but once I saw the black hat Candy was history. 

My heart wasn't in it when I picked up Dawn, but I had gotten her to depend on me spending my Thursdays with her so it was a good bet that she, expecting me, had turned down some one else who might have called asking her for 'a date' so I showed up on time. 

About half way through dinner Dawn put he fork down and asked: 

"What's the matter Bobby?" 

The poor girl had more than enough problems of her own and she damned sure didn't need to be listening to me whine, but I was in the dumps and the mood was right and I said: 

"My life sucks!" 

Then I told her about my last year with Mary Alice and what happened there. I told her about Candy and what happened there and Dawn surprised me when she said: 

"I thought everyone knew that Jeff was bi-sexual. And most everyone who knows Jeff and Candy has suspected what you found out." 

"How do you know this?" 

"You moved here and only attended high school here your senior year so you weren't really in tune with things. I was born here and raised here Bobby and you can't hide much in a small town." 

She waved the waitress over and asked for a 'doggie bag.' She saw the confused look on my face and said:  

===

"You aren't eating it anyway so let's get out of here." 

"Where are we going?" 

"To my house." 

"Why?" 

"Because there is no use in going to the motel. Your heart wouldn't be in it and you don't need to be alone tonight so I'm taking you home with me. We will sit at my kitchen table, get drunk and tell each other sob stories." 

I woke up in the morning on Dawn's couch. What woke me was the noise coming from Dawn's kitchen. I sat up and out of the corner of my eye I saw someone hurry out of the room. A minute later a little boy walked into the room and came over to me and said: 

"Mommy told me we needed to cheer you up." He handed me a doll and asked, "Would you like to play with my "G.I.Joe?" 

I looked at the doll and was trying to think of a way to ask how one went about playing with a "G.I.Joe" when a young girl walked into the room carrying a tray. She brought it to me and held it out. It had a cup of coffee on it along with a spoon, a sugar bowl and a small pitcher of cream. She handed me the tray and said: 

"Mommy says breakfast will be ready in ten minutes." 

She stood there watching me as I put cream and sugar in the coffee and took a sip. Then she said: 

"My name is Darla and I'm almost seven years old. That's Jeffery" she said pointing to the little boy. "He's only five and can't go to school yet." 

She watched me sip my coffee and then she said, "I'm going to be in the second grade." Before I could respond to that Dawn came into the room and asked me how I liked my eggs. I got up and followed her into the kitchen and sat down at the kitchen table. As I sipped my coffee and watched Dawn work I thought back to the night before. How we sat in the kitchen and drank beer and talked about our time in high school and how our lives had gone since. When I got up to leave she said I had had too much beer and she wouldn't let me leave to drive home and besides she said: 

"You don't want to be alone tonight anyway." 

She made me a bed on her couch and told me that she would see to it that I got up in time for work. 

She was frying eggs and she turned to me and asked: 

"Why are you looking at me like that?" 

"I'm just trying to figure out why some guy hasn't snapped you up yet." 

"You just met two of the reasons in the living room and the third is still asleep and you know what the fourth one is. To land a man I'd have to move to another city -- one where no one knew my reputation and even then it would be iffy. Not too many guys want to marry a large family." 

I couldn't say anything to that because I knew she was right and that was a shame. She was extremely good looking, intelligent, and from what I'd seen so far of her kids she was doing a hell of a good job as a mom. I don't know where it came from -- I really don't -- but I suddenly said: 

"Where would you like to go to dinner tonight?" 

"What? I'm sorry Bobby, but there is no way I can get a baby sitter on such short notice." 

"Who said you would need a baby sitter? I'm talking about all of us going." 

She looked at me kind of shocked and I said, "I know. How about Chuckie Cheeses. The kids will love it and I haven't had pizza for a while." 

"You are serious?" 

"Of course I am." 

Candy called me at work around ten that morning and wanted to know what our plans for the night were. I took the coward's way out. 

"I don't think I'll be seeing you any more Candy. There is a chance that Mary Alice and I are going put things back together or at least try." 

"You're kidding me! You are going to let that slut back into your life?" 

"Goodbye Candy." 

I took Dawn and the kids out that night and we had a great time. Sunday I took them on a picnic and Sunday night after Dawn had put Darla, Jeffery and little Becky to bed I stuck my nose in Dawn's business. 

"How much do you make a week from your gentlemen callers?" 

"Whoa Rob, that is none of your business and I'm surprised that you would ask me such a crude question." 

"It is my business Dawn. I want to make myself exclusive and I need to know what it is going to cost me." 

"Why would you want to do something like that?" 

"A couple of reasons. One is that I plan to keep seeing you and second, some day your kids are going to hear things at school if you keep seeing gentlemen callers. You said it yourself; this is still a small town." 

"You coming around will still keep the talk going." 

"Not if everyone thinks that you have a new steady boyfriend and have given up what you were doing. If I'm the only man they see coming around that is what they will all think -- that you have a man in your life now." 

"Are you serious about this?" 

"Absolutely." 

"I usually have two or three as you call them -- gentlemen callers -- and I make two hundred from each of them. The insurance paid off the house when Hal didn't come back so I only need about sixteen hundred or so a month to meet my bills and pay for what I have to buy. I could see more than two or three, but I don't. All I want is enough to take care of my babies." 

"I'll give you two thousand a month for exclusive use." 

"I still don't understand why you would do it." 

"Simple really. I like sex at least two or three times a week. Now that Mary Alice and Candy are out of my life I need an outlet. I don't want to do the bar scene and strike out more than I score and I don't want to go back to dating and spend three or four weeks trying to get to home plate with some girl without getting there. As far as the money goes I could easily spend that much a month wining and dining whoever I was trying to score with. It is a win/win situation for both of us." 

Dawn looked at me for a minute or so while she thought about what I had just proposed and then she said: 

"I've got rules. No sleepovers and I never do anything in the house when the kids are here." 

"How about sleepovers at my place if I pay the baby sitter?" 

"Once in a while maybe, but I don't like to be gone from my babies too much." 

For the next six months Dawn and I "dated" two, three or four times a week and maybe once every two weeks she would spend the night at my place. On Friday nights or on the weekends I usually took Dawn and her kids somewhere. By the end of the first month the kids were calling me Uncle Rob. 

Dawn was much more than a piece of ass -- much, much more -- and one morning after she had stayed the night with me I was sitting up in bed looking down on her sleeping form and I thought again what a shame it was that guys couldn't get past her coming with a ready made family and a slightly shady past. She would make some man a damned good wife. She was intelligent, witty, had a great sense of humor and was a fantastic cook. She was good looking and sexy and she was great in bed. She woke up and saw me looking down at her and she reached up and pulled me down and snuggled in and the two of us fell back to sleep. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

It was inevitable, given that both Dawn and Candy had told me about it still being a small town, that Candy would eventually learn about all the time I was spending with Dawn. Word of our going out for dinner, drinks and dancing and of my taking Dawn and her kids places on weekends would get back to Candy. 

I still ate breakfast and lunch at the restaurant although I did make it an early breakfast knowing that Candy wouldn't come in until nine or so. It had to happen sooner or later and so I wasn't surprised when one morning Candy sat down on the other side of the table from me. 

"How have you been Hey You?" 

"Fine Candy, and you?" 

"I have my good days and my bad ones. How are things working with you and Mary Alice?" 

"They aren't." 

"I hear you are spending a lot of time with Dawn Metzler." 

"I am seeing her a lot." 

"Why haven't you called?" 

"No point." 

"Why not? I thought we had something good going. What happened?" 

"What happened was a lunch date with Marv Baxter." 

"I don't understand?" 

I had lunch with Marv at a TGI Friday's in Colorado Springs. The one right across the street from the Days Inn. In fact, you could see the Days Inn parking lot from our table." 

Candy's face paled a touch and then she said, "Nice seeing you Rob" and she got up and left the restaurant. 

++++++++++++++ 

The divorce from Mary Alice should have been quick, but for some reason Mary Alice kept putting up road blocks. I hadn't talked to her since the day I handed her the divorce papers even though she tried calling me several times a week. Finally my attorney said we needed to sit down with Mary Alice and her attorney. I told him to go ahead and set it up. It turned out that what Mary Alice wanted was some time alone with me so we could talk. I told my lawyer okay and he and Mary Alice's lawyer left the room. 

"What do you want Mary Alice?" 

"I want you back home where you belong. I admit I made a mistake -- a big one - - but Herb meant nothing to me. It was a fling Rob; an ill advised fling, but that is all that it was. It happened at a time when I was down on myself, thinking that I was getting old and wasn't attractive any more. I love you Rob and I'm sorry for the way I behaved there for a while, but I'll make it up to you Rob, I swear I will. I love you and I want you back with me." 

"Not a chance Mary Alice. There isn't any way that I will ever forget seeing Herb slamming his cock in your ass while you begged him to do it harder. Maybe if I hadn't seen it, but unfortunately I did. Here is what is going to happen Mary Alice. I filed under Irreconcilable Differences instead of Infidelity. I did that because I like your family and they didn't need to know what kind of a whore you were. If you keep fighting the divorce I'll drop it for a couple of weeks and then file again using Infidelity as grounds and then I'll send a copy of the audio and video that I have of you and Herb to everyone in your family and to everyone that you know. We are done Mary Alice and you are the one who did it to us. Now you have to live with it." 

Mary Alice withdrew all objections and the divorce went forward. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

The evening of the day the divorce became final I took Dawn out for drinks and dancing and after we had been in the lounge for about an hour Dawn got up to use the ladies room. As she walked away from our table I saw all the male eyes in the room following her and I smiled to myself and thought: 

"Eat your hearts out boys, she's mine." 

And then suddenly I realized that she was. She was mine! And I also realized as I watched her walk back to the table that sooner or later some guy was going to take a long look at her and decide that she would be worth having, ready made family or not. We went to my place when we left the lounge and made love twice before I took her home. When I dropped her off I said: 

"Prep the kids for Chuckie Cheeses tonight okay?" 

"Sure. They love that place." 

We were sitting in a booth and the kids were playing and I said to Dawn, "I want to change our arrangement." 

"Oh? In what way?" 

"I don't want to give you two thousand a month any more." 

Her face lost its smile and she said, "I see." 

"No you don't" I said as I slid the little velvet covered box across the table to her. "Instead of two thousand a month I want you to have everything that I have." 

She opened the box, saw the ring and said, "Oh my God" and started crying. 

++++++++++++++ 

I won't pretend that it has been easy. Even though Dawn had been seeing only me for months her 'gentlemen callers' still called and they approached her whenever they ran across her when she was out of the house. She was always polite when she turned them down because at the time she didn't know how long our arrangement would last and she didn't want to alienate her 'fan base.' 

The calls stopped when we got married, but the men who had "known" her still approached her when she was out and about. I knew when I married her that it was likely to happen and Dawn did too and she made me promise to let her handle it. There are times it hasn't been all that easy, but then I guess that is the price I have to pay for having Dawn. And I do have to say that she is worth it and more. Report_Story
