===

I was on the leg press when I saw her come in. Tall woman, I would guess 5'8'' or 5'9" and maybe 125 pounds. Blond hair put up in a pony-tail and from the looks of her I figured that she was there more to stay in shape than to get into shape. She was the kind of woman I liked to see in the circuit machine area -- someone easy on the eyes, someone you could watch and appreciate while you worked out. 

I finished my three sets on the leg press and was moving to the chest press to work on the anterior deltoids, and triceps when I noticed that she looked a little confused as she stood there looking at the leg extension machine. I walked over to her. 

"First time here?" 

"Yes." 

"You ever use any of these machines before?" 

"No. I have a treadmill and a Stairmaster in my basement, but I've never used anything like this before." 

"You looking to work on a specific area or just a general workout?" 

"Just a general workout. The Stairmaster and the treadmill don't do anything for my arms and upper body." 

"If you would like I can give you a quick tour and some information on how to use the equipment." 

"Do you work here? A personal trainer?" 

"No to both. I'm just here for my workout, but I remember my first time here and if someone hadn't taken the time to explain the equipment to me I could very well have ended up hurting myself. My name is Rob" I said as I extended my hand. She took it and said: 

"Minerva, but I prefer to be called Minnie. And yes. I would like it if you showed me around." 

I walked her through the circuit training area and explained all the machines to her. I showed her how to adjust the seat, select the weights and gave her a short explanation of what muscle group the machine was designed to work. I pointed out that the machines were numbered and explained that it was best if she used the machines in numerical order. 

"They are laid out so you don't keep working the same area over and over. One is for hamstrings, two is for triceps, outer delts and pecs, and three is for quadriceps and so on. Any questions?" 

"I'm sure that I'll have dozens once I get started." 

She moved to machine number one -- the leg press- and started working out and I moved on to finish my workout. I kept looking back at her to see that she was okay (I think I already mentioned that she was easy on the eyes) and she seemed to be getting along okay. I finished my workout, did my stretches and was getting ready to head for the showers when she stopped me. 

"Do you work out here often?" 

"Every day, Monday through Friday. I'm here when the doors open at five in the morning." 

She looked at the wall clock that said three-fifteen and said, "You have been here ten hours?" 

I chuckled and said, "No. I was out of town yesterday and I flew in at eleven this morning so today is a late day for me. Nice meeting you Minnie. You take care and hopefully I'll see you around" and then I headed for the shower room. 

+++++++++++++++++++++ 

As he headed for the shower I decided that he would indeed see me around. I hadn't expected to find what I wanted so quickly, but he would do. Fairly good looking, obviously in good shape, no wedding ring -- not that that meant anything, after all, hadn't I taken off mine? Yes he would do nicely. As I watched his tight butt disappear through the door of the men's locker room I thought back on the series of events that brought me -- a married woman -- to this gym with the prime purpose of picking up a man (and maybe losing that extra ten pounds I didn't want) but make no mistake, the man is what I was after. 

I met Brad when he came to work at Chambers Brothers where I was the office manager. He was charming, witty and extremely good looking and when he asked me to have dinner with him I said yes. It was a fun evening and I said yes to a second date and that one led to a third and then a fourth, fifth and sixth. I'm not a prude, but I'm not a slut either and I do like sex -- a lot -- but I really have to like a guy before I give it up and I really liked Brad so on our seventh date he got lucky. In addition to Brad's other good qualities he turned out to be an excellent lover. 

We became a couple and for the next four months we kept steady company. Then disaster struck. I got pregnant. It wasn't supposed to happen, but it did. I couldn't use birth control pills because of some bad side effects so I depended on diaphragms, spermicides and douching, but it seemed that those methods failed me. My fault, not Brad's since I had told him I was protected. I did what I thought was the right thing and broke up with Brad. 

After three weeks of hounding me for the reason for the breakup I finally told him that I was pregnant and he got points for not saying, "Is it mine" or "Are you sure that I'm the father?" Instead he said that we needed to hurry up and get married so the timing would look right when the baby was born. I told him that we would not be getting married; that I was not going to have a husband who married me out of a sense of obligation. I told him that I had been the one to screw up and I would shoulder the responsibility. He stared at me for several seconds and then walked back to his desk and took something out of his briefcase and then walked back to me. He handed me a little box covered in black velvet and told me to open it. Inside was an engagement ring. 

"I was just getting ready to ask you to marry me when you broke it off between us. We can have the license and blood tests out of the way by Thursday, see a justice of the peace on Friday and have the weekend for a honeymoon. What do you say?" 

What could I say but yes and it went off as planned. Five months into the pregnancy I miscarried and there were some complications with the end result that I could never have children. Brad was a little disappointed because he wanted kids, but he told me that it was no biggie, that we could always adopt. 

++++++++++++ 

For the next six years I thought that I had a great marriage and a loving husband. And then I found out that I was probably wrong about that. Brad had left Chambers Brothers for a higher paying position at McFee and Sons. It might have been for more money, but as far as I was concerned it wasn't a better job. It involved a lot of late hours and some traveling which left me home alone with not much else to do but watch idiotic TV shows or read books. I didn't take up any outside hobbies or activities because I wanted to be sure that my time was free so I could spend it with Brad when he was home. 

Brad had just returned from a trip and we were attending a promotion party for one of the men he worked with. It was being held at the Marriott and it was my first exposure to the people he worked with. About an hour into the affair I had to use the ladies room. While there I refreshed my makeup, but when I looked in my clutch for my comb it wasn't there. Then I remembered that I had used it in the car and had put it in my coat pocket. I went to the coatroom and found my coat hanging on the rack in the back. I was fishing in the pocket for my comb when I heard a woman's voice just outside the coatroom say: 

"Did you get a look at Brad's wife?" 

"I'll say. After seeing her I have to wonder what he sees in Alice." 

"Do you think she suspects that he is taking Alice to the motel for long lunches?" 

"I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to put up with that kind of crap." 

"You sorry you said no when Brad hit on you? Alice says he is a tiger in the sack." 

"No, I'm not sorry. I did consider it for a bit because he is such a hunk, but I decided against it. There is no percentage in playing around with a married man. How about you? Were you tempted?" 

"No. I've got a good man at home and even though Brad is like you say -- a hunk -- I'm not willing to risk what I have for some one who plays around like Brad." 

"Knowing Alice I'm surprised that she hasn't done something tacky like getting buddy-buddy with Brad's wife. You know what I mean?" 

"Oh yeah. The old "See how nice I am? I'll bet you don't know I'm screwing your husband" act. I'm pretty sure that Brad has warned her and he probably is watching her pretty close." 

"I wonder if her fiancée knows what she is doing?" 

"Probably not. He seems to 'gah-gah' over her to see anything but what she wants him to see." 

"We had better get back. Don't want to miss the fun if Alice slips by Brad and gets to his wife." 

I stood there stunned over what I'd just heard. My Brad cheating on me? No way! It couldn't be my Brad. There had to be another Brad working there. I got my comb out of my coat pocket and went back to the ladies room. I was washing my hands in the sink when a rather brassy looking blonde walked in. She came over next to me and took her lipstick out of her clutch purse. She glanced over at me, smiled and said: 

"You're Brad's wife, right? Minnie is it?" 

"That's right." 

"I'm Alice. I work with Brad. We have done a lot together since he came to work with us." 

"I believe I've heard your name mentioned." 

"Well it is nice meeting you finally. Brad does talk a lot about you when we are together." 

"Spend a lot of time together I take it?" 

"Oh yes. We are assigned to the same cost center so we end up working a lot of projects together." 

"Nice meeting you Alice, but I need to get back to the party." 

As I walked out of that restroom I was no longer saying, "Oh no, not my Brad" but "I wonder if there is anything to what those two women were saying." But it wasn't until I got back to the table and told Brad that I'd met Alice in the bathroom that things took a turn for the worse. 

"She told me that she spends a lot of time with you and that you two have done a lot together since you came to work here." 

The quick flash of concern (or was it fear) that went across his face pretty much told me that where there was smoke there was likely to be fire. I noticed that for the rest of the night Brad kept glancing nervously at the table where Alice was sitting. I also noticed several people watching our table with bemused grins and smiles on their faces. Did every one know? Were they thinking "That poor woman. If only she knew" or were they thinking "Way to go Brad. Wife and lover in the same room and the wife is clueless." 

Brad was quiet on the way home and after several minutes I asked him if something was the matter and he said no; that he was thinking that if he had made the move sooner that would have been his promotion party. I smiled and told him not to worry that he'd get the next promotion. 

I kept my suspicions to myself and tried to act normal the rest of the weekend, but it wasn't easy. Brad had been gone four days and he wanted to make love. I was hesitant. I didn't want to make love to him if he was cheating on me, but I really didn't know that he was. I had my suspicions, but that was all. That plus the fact that my refusal would not be normal let me give him what he wanted, but my heart wasn't in it and for the first time in our marriage Brad didn't bring me to orgasm. 

As soon as Brad left for work on Monday I called into work and arranged to take three days off. I was parked where I could see Brad's car when he came out of the building at lunch time. He had Alice with him. They were laughing and talking as they went over and got in his car. As they pulled out of the parking lot my heart sank as I began to accept that my husband was a cheating bastard. I pulled out and followed them as they turned on Wilcox and headed south toward motel row. I was debating on whether to wait for them to head for a room or confront him when he got out of the car when his turn signal came on and he pulled into the parking lot at Denny's. I parked across the street and watched as Brad and Alice walked into the restaurant. I started to castigate myself for being a stupid, jealous woman. I should have known that my Brad wasn't going to cheat on me. I followed them back to work and then I did what I always did to relive stress -- I went shopping. 

I hit Victoria's Secret, Lane Bryant and a half dozen other places and bought myself some sexy clothes to wear for my hubby when I made it up to him for all the bad thoughts I'd been having. 

Before he left for work that morning Brad told me that he would be working late and while I was a little surer now that he wasn't cheating on me I still had taken the time off to investigate and I would see it through. More to punish myself for doubting him than for any other reason. At five-thirty Alice came out, got in her car and drove away. I forced myself to sit in my car and watch the building as I told myself: 

"You stupid bitch! You should have known better. Sit here, be bored, waste a night because of your stupid idea that Brad was a cheater." 

At eight-thirty Brad came out of the building with two other men and while they were walking to their cars I took off so I could beat Brad home. When he walked in the door he found me waiting for him in what he called my "fuck suit" - a pair of black pumps with five inch heels and nothing else. I did my absolute best to fuck his brains out. 

The next day I was again parked outside where I could see Brad's car. At lunch time he came out of the building with the same two men I'd seen him with the previous night. I followed them until they turned into the parking lot at The Red Robin and then I went home. I fixed Brad's favorite dinner; put on one of the outfits I'd bought at Victoria's Secret and was waiting just inside the front door when Brad walked into the house at six. I handed him the martini that I had prepared for him (shaken -- not stirred) and when he took it from me I went to my knees, unzipped him and gave him head while he sipped his martini. 

Over dinner he asked me what was the occasion and I told him no special occasion, I just thought things were getting a little stale in the bedroom and needed some spicing up. The night was just as exhausting as the previous one. 

Before he left the next morning he told me that it would be another late night for him and not to hold dinner. I smiled at him and told him I would be waiting. Again, more to punish myself for my mistrust than for any other reason I was outside watching when he and Alice left the building for lunch. I followed along and wondered what restaurant it would be that day. Brad's right turn signal came on and I looked over to the right and saw that it wasn't a restaurant parking lot. He was turning into the parking lot for the Days Inn. I watched as Brad went into the office and got a key and I watched as he and Alice went into room 116 and I was still watching when the two of the came out of the room two hours later. 

There were tears in my eyes as I drove home. Anger, hurt, humiliation and rage -- I suffered a little of each as my mind tried to cope with the betrayal. I was outside again at five when he and Alice came out together and drove back to the Days Inn and went into room 116. They hadn't even given up the room. 

I'd had all day to think about it and as I drove home I made up my mind. My revenge would to be to let Brad support me while I cut back on the amount of sex I gave him as I looked for lovers of my own. I would never refuse Brad sex, but I would never again be the one to initiate it. As I sat at my kitchen table and sipped a glass of white wine I thought about what I was going to do. I was going to take on a lover (or lovers) and as long as I was going to do it I wanted one who could fuck my brains out as often as we could get together. He would need to be in good shape and have plenty of stamina. What better place to look than at a gym and while I shopped for my lover maybe I could get rid of the extra ten pounds that I thought I was carrying. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I was waiting at the door to the gym at five with Bonnie and Debbie, two of the other regulars, when she walked up and said "Good morning." 

"Good morning to you. Decide to do it early?" 

"Need to get it done before I go to work. Can't do it during the day and I have too much going on in the evenings so here I am. Besides, if I come in when you do you can keep an eye on me and make sure I don't do something dumb and maybe hurt myself." 

Oh I would most definitely keep an eye on her I thought to myself. I saw Bonnie and Debbie look at each other and smile when Minnie said that. I had tried to hit on both of them at one time or another and with no luck. Debbie had almost been tempted, but she was engaged and Bonnie was happily married. I had already noticed the absence of rings on Minnie's ring finger, but that might not mean anything. She might have taken them off to exercise. I'd just have to play it by ear. 

Linda unlocked the door at five on the dot and Minnie and I headed for the circuit room while Bonnie and Debbie headed for the lap pool. I helped Minnie get started on machine number one -- the leg press -- and then I went to the free weight room and got a twenty-five pound weight, went to the rack and did fifty crunches. By the time I was done Minnie was on the second machine in the circuit -- the chest press. I watched her for a minute or so and then moved to the leg press. 

As I worked out I watched Minnie and the more I watched the more certain I was that I was going to take a shot at her and I started thinking of how to make my move. First I figured that I'd better give it a couple of days to develop some sort of rapport, but then I thought that she might not come back. She wouldn't be the first one to start an exercise program, go once or twice, and then decide that staying in bed for that extra hour of sleep was more inviting. If I was going to go for it it had better be now. Doing the crunches had put me behind and it would be necessary for me to finish up when Minnie did so I skipped the seated leg curl and only did one set of thirty reps on the shoulder press and then I grabbed a quick shower. 

I was leaning on the front counter leafing through some brochures when Minnie came out of the women's locker room. As she came toward me I turned and faced her. 

"Got time for a cup of coffee?" 

She looked at her watch and then said, "Since I showered here and only need to dress for work when I get home I guess I have time. The juice bar here?" 

"No. Too many people will stop to say hi. How about the IHOP on the corner?" 

"That will work." 

When she settled on the seat across from me I said, "So how do you feel after your first full work out?" 

"Not bad. My legs are okay, but my arms feel like they are made out of lead." 

"Your arms just aren't used to it. Back off to a lighter weight for the next couple of workouts and then gradually increase it when you get used to exercising." 

"And that will take what, about five or six years?" 

"Oh come on now, it won't be that bad. Didn't you say that you had a treadmill and a Stairmaster at home?" 

"Yeah, but I don't think I mentioned that they also make me ache." 

As she sipped her coffee I made a point of looking at my watch and then I said: 

"I know you will need to leave soon to get ready for work and I know that I don't have much time so I'll just have to jump in with both feet. I would like to get to know you better. Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?" 

"I would like that, but I don't know if I can make it tonight. Why don't you give me a number where I can reach you and as soon as I get to work and check my calendar I'll give you a call." 

We finished our coffee and she got up to leave. I admired her tight looking ass as she walked toward the front door. If I had any kind of luck at all I would find out just how tight it was. 

++++++++++++ 

I could feel his eyes on my ass as I headed for the door. I wasn't sure, but I thought that Brad would be "working late" that night and I would call him as soon as I got to work and find out. If he was going to be working late I would have dinner with Rob. Dinner and just maybe something else. It would depend on Rob. If he was a fast worker he could get lucky. I didn't really want to behave like a slut so I wouldn't be making any moves, but I had decided on Rob as my revenge lover and the sooner we got to it the better I would like it.  

===

Brad was already gone when I got home so on the off chance that I would be having dinner with Rob I selected a bra and panty set that I had purchased at Victoria's Secret to tantalize Brad but which he would now never see and then I pulled on a dress that showed my legs to their best advantage. I put my sexiest heels in a tote bag. I'd put them on after work if I was going to meet Rob. For work I chose a pair of flats. 

Ten minutes after getting to work I was on the phone to Brad. "I don't remember honey. Did you say you were going to be working late tonight?" 

"Yes I will be. Why?" 

"If you are going to be late I'm going to do some shopping. I saw something that I want to try on." 

"Something sexy?" 

"Oh yes, very sexy. I just hope that it fits." 

I hung up on Brad and called Rob and told him I was free that evening if he still wanted to take me to dinner and got a yes. I spent the day thinking about what I was planning on doing and by quitting time I had totally changed my attitude. Where I had planned on not making any moves and would just wait for Rob to make them I had now decided not to pussyfoot around. I intended to cuckold Brad and so I should just get on with it. 

Rob was waiting for me in the lobby when I got off work and as I walked toward him he softly whistled and said: 

"Wow! What a difference from when you are in workout clothes." 

"You like?" I said as I spun around in front of him in my sexy high heels." 

"Oh yeah. You are looking good. No, make that you look fantastic." 

"Good enough to eat?" 

"What?" 

"Let's stop playing games sweetie. I know what you want and I want it too. You want to waste time having dinner or would you rather get right to the desert?" 

"When you put it that way the decision is simple. My apartment is thirty minutes from here and I don't want to waste thirty minutes. There is a hotel at the end of this block. We can be in a room in ten." 

Actually it was fifteen, but who was counting. 

Rob was a marvelous lover and he gave me several orgasms before I had to finally put a stop to the evening. 

"I need to get going lover. I need to beat my husband home." 

I saw the look that crossed his face and said, "Yes sweetie, I'm married, but I won't let it get in the way of our having fun. I assume you would like to do this again?" 

"Silly question. When?" 

"It can only be on the nights that he works late or is out of town. How do you feel about being on call?" 

"It works for me." 

"There is also the fact that this hotel is only one block from where I work and I can take long lunches." 

"Would tomorrow be a long lunch day?" 

"Absolutely. My lobby at twelve?" 

"No. Here as soon as you can get here. I'll already have the room when you get here. That will give us just a tad more time." 

"I like a man who thinks ahead." 

I kissed him and headed for home. 

+++++++++++++++ 

As she left the hotel room I wondered what kind of dim bulb she was married to that he couldn't keep her at home. She was intelligent, witty, easy to talk with, drop dead gorgeous and an absolute tiger in bed. In fact, she had so much going for her that if she wasn't married I'd consider going after her with the idea of making it a permanent arrangement and that was saying something considering I'd promised myself never again after the five year disaster that my marriage had been. Those five years with Annabelle had me saying that I'd kill myself before I'd ever get into a long term relationship again. 

Then along comes something like Minnie. And she's married. Well, no one ever said that life would be fair. I'd played with married ladies before and I knew that there was one thing you could count on and that was that it wouldn't last. Maybe four or five months if you were lucky. But then four or five months with something as nice as Minnie was better than no Minnie at all and who knows, she just might be the one who would go longer. One could only hope. 

++++++++++++++++++++++ 

I beat Brad home and was in bed freshly showered and douched when he got there. I wasn't all that keen on having sex with him knowing that I was going to be getting Alice's leftovers, but I did want to give him Rob's. And who knows, I might luck out and have the night be one of the ones when he really did work late. 

I was lying on the bed naked. I was propped up on a pillow and reading Stephen Frey's "Forced Out" when Brad walked into the room. I put the book down and spread my legs and then said: 

"See anything you might like?" 

He just grinned and started undressing. 

I almost had an orgasm when I pushed his head down so he could eat my pussy and I did have an orgasm thinking about Rob as Brad fucked me. It was a very satisfying evening for me. 

+++++++++++ 

I was at the gym door talking with Bonnie and waiting for Linda to unlock the door when Minnie got there. The three of us made general conversation until Linda opened up. We checked in at the counter and got our towels and as Bonnie headed for the stairs Minnie leaned over and whispered in my ear: 

"Don't wear yourself out this morning lover. You will need your strength come lunch time." 

"No fair" a voice from behind us said, "I saw him first and I've known him longer." 

We turned and saw Debbie standing there. Minnie looked at Debbie and then back at me and said: 

"Oops." 

I smiled at Minnie and said, "Ignore her. I gave her a chance and she shot me down." 

"What did you expect?" Debbie said, "You hadn't shaved in a week and what girl wants to put up with a hairy bear." 

"That's not what you told me at the time. You told me that your fiancée wouldn't like it." 

"Well yeah, that too." 

The girls headed for their locker room and I headed for the men's locker room. I put my work clothes in the locker and then headed for the treadmill. I put in twenty minutes at five miles an hour to get my heart rate up and then moved to the circuit room. Minnie was in the free weights room with Bonnie and Debbie and they were showing her some exercises she could do using barbells and I had moved through six of the circuit machines before she came into the circuit room. I finished my workout before she was halfway through the circuit so I walked over to the shoulder press where she was in the middle of her set. I waited until she did the last repetition and then said: 

"Noon? For sure?" 

"You can bet on it." 

"I'll already have the room and I'll be waiting in the lobby for you." 

"Did you take your vitamins this morning?" 

"No." 

"Better get some. I plan to be very active and I would like it if you could at least try to keep up." 

"All I can promise is that I will do my best." 

The hours seemed to drag along at work. The more I thought of meeting Minnie for a long lunch hour the slower time seemed to go. Finally, after a couple of years, it was eleven forty-five. As I left the office I told the receptionist that I would be having a long lunch with a client if anyone came asking about me. I was sitting in the hotel lobby, room key in my pocket, when I saw Minnie come in the front door. I got up and walked to the elevator, pushed the button and waited for the door to open. Minnie walked up and we stood there not talking or acknowledging each other. There wasn't any way that anyone watching would have known that we were together. 

The car arrived, the door opened and the two of us walked inside. As soon as the door was fully closed we were in a clinch. I had my hand in her blouse and she was pulling my zipper down. When the door opened on three we raced for room 306. Once inside it was a race to see who could get their clothes off first. Minnie won because she cheated. She didn't take off her nylons, garter belt or heels. 

Minnie almost didn't leave me enough strength to go back to work. I began to wonder if I even needed to go to the gym with the workouts she was giving me. 

++++++++++++++++++ 

As I rode the elevator down from the third floor I thought back over the day. It had been most informative. It started when I was in the locker room with Bonnie and Debbie. As I was putting my stuff in my locker Bonnie said: 

"Is Rob your first revenge fuck?" 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"I asked if Rob is your first revenge fuck." 

"I have no idea what you are talking about." 

"You don't recognize us? You really have no idea of who we are?" 

"I don't believe I've ever seen either one of you before I started coming here." 

"Well I guess we did look a lot different in heels and evening dresses but I thought for sure that you would have recognized our voices. Tell me, does this sound familiar? "Do you think she suspects that he is taking Alice to the motel for long lunches?" 

She saw from the look on my face that I finally knew what she was talking about. 

"Debbie and I saw you go into the coatroom. You were meant to hear what we said. I'm betting that you checked it out and found out that it was true. Suddenly you are here working out and Rob has that "well fucked" look on his face so the question is, is he your first revenge fuck?" 

I had looked from one to the other, shrugged and then said, "Yes he is." 

I had looked at booth of them again and then had asked, "You disliked Brad that much that you had to make sure that I knew what he was doing?" 

"It wasn't as much disliking Brad as hating Alice" Bonnie said, "We both despise her. And to be honest about it I'm not too keen on Brad either. I can't stand a cheater. My ex cheated on me and it destroyed our family. Our kids are still having trouble getting over our divorce." 

"I have the same basic problem" Debbie said. "My fiancée is an ex-fiancée because I caught him playing stink finger with one of my now ex-girlfriends." 

I remembered the conversation I'd overheard and asked them if it was true that Brad had hit on them and they both said that he had. Then they told me that he had hit on almost every woman in the office -- married and single -- and he had scored with at least three of them in addition to Alice. Then Debbie hit me with a question that I didn't have an answer for. 

"Is Rob just going to be the first? Are you going to try other lovers?" 

"Why do you want to know that?" 

"I don't know; just curious." 

"Oh bullshit" Bonnie said. "The truth is that she has had her eye on Rob since she dumped her fiancée. What she wants to know is are you keeping him or are you going to move on to someone else so she can go after Rob." 

I'd had to think about that for a couple of seconds before I admitted that I didn't really know what I was going to do. I explained that I had gone after Rob so I would have something to throw into Brad's face and that I had never considered going after lovers plural. It gave me something to think about. 

++++++++++++++++++++ 

I looked down at her as she slept soundly next to me. I noticed what I thought was a slight smile on her face and I hoped that it was because of me. God knows I'd worked hard at trying to make sure that she enjoyed what we were doing. I still marveled at the stupidity of her husband. That he didn't do all in his power to keep her at home with him just absolutely astounded me. The more time I spent with her the more I wished that she wasn't married. 

The last seven months had been magic for me. Minnie had made me change my mind about never getting into another long term relationship. She had made me want to make her mine forever. Not that I could tell her that. She had done nothing that would lead me to believe that what we had was anything more than a sexual interlude that would some day end and I was careful not to say or do anything that would bring that day closer. I very much wanted to hold onto what I had. Long lunches two and sometimes three times a week; entire nights when her husband was out of town on business and the occasional quickie after our morning workouts at the gym. I just could not get enough of her. If I couldn't have her full time I hoped that I could at least have her part-time for the next twenty or thirty years.

I woke him with a blow job and when he was up (both awake AND erect) I moved over him and used my right hand to guide him into me. It was a simply marvelous way to start the day. As we showered together I had to keep pushing his hands away or we would have ended up back on the bed and I would have ended up being late for work. I wanted to end up back on the bed. I was still hot from what had happened when Brad made his nightly 'check-in' phone call. Rob was doing me doggie when the call came and he wouldn't pull out and let me take the call. 

I scooted across the bed to the phone with Rob coming along behind me. We were like two dogs in heat tied together by the knot in the dogs cock. I answered the call and then talked with Brad while Rob kept slowly fucking me. I was so hot that my pussy still tingled as I thought about it eight hours later. After I hung up I tried to berate Rob for his actions, but he just smiled and said: 

"Bitch all you want lover, but you loved it." 

And I had. Oh God had I ever. We went to the gym for our morning work out and then we stopped and had breakfast at the IHOP. Over French toast I asked: 

"Long lunch today or did you get enough last night?" 

"You know the answer to that one." 

"Oh yeah? And what would that be?" 

"I can never get enough of you." 

"Long lunch it is then. Take your vitamins." 

On the way from the IHOP to work I wondered just how long I was going to keep seeing Rob before having my confrontation with my "loving husband." My original plan was to have a short affair, confront Brad about his affair with Alice, throw mine with Rob in his face and then ask him if he wanted to stop the running around and try to make the marriage work. That was before finding out from Debbie and Bonnie about his other affairs. 

Armed with what Debbie and Bonnie told me I had done some discrete investigating and had found out that Brad had three short affairs with girls who worked at Chambers Brothers AFTER he had married me and before he had taken his current job. The question I had been asking myself for months was did I want to try and make the marriage work and more and more I found myself thinking that the answer to that question was "No, not really." 

I was having a blast giving Brad well used pussy. I made sure that I had sex with Brad after having made love to Rob. It was rarely 'right after' but always on the same day. I was always showered and douched so he wouldn't ever suspect, but except for when he went out of town I always gave myself to Brad within hours of when Rob pulled out of me. 

I was enjoying the hell out of cuckolding my husband. 

And, I suddenly realized, I didn't want to give up Rob. 

Now what do I do? 

++++++++++++++++++ 

I had the room key in my hand when I saw her coming in the front entrance. Between the time we'd had breakfast at the IHOP and the time I checked in and got the room key I'd had a complete change of heart. I was killing myself -- at least mentally -- by continuing my affair with Minnie. I had to admit to myself that I was hopelessly in love with her and not being able to have her full time was really messing me up. My work was suffering because Minnie was always on my mind. When I wasn't with her I was always thinking ahead to when I would be. 

I had no life when I wasn't with her. I'd sit in my apartment and stare at the walls and think about her and count the minutes until it was time to hit the gym in the morning and see her again. We had talked and I knew why she was seeing me and she showed no interest in ever leaving her husband. 

I couldn't continue on with her only being part time in my life. For my own good I needed to end it. I would even have to change gyms so I wouldn't have to suffer seeing her. As I watched her walk toward the elevator where I was waiting I knew that it would be a hard thing to do, but I also knew that I had to do it.

Brad came into the bedroom with a towel wrapped around his waist and still dripping from his shower. As I slipped my heels on I asked him what time he would be home for dinner and when he said he would be working late again something in my mind snapped. As I picked up my purse from the dresser I said: 

"Why don't you just go ahead and spend the night with Alice instead of trying to hurry home. That way I can spend the night at Rob's place instead of rushing home so I can be here when you get here." 

"What the hell are you saying?" 

"You know full well what I'm saying Brad, but not to worry sweetie; no need for a divorce. You just see Alice or whomever when you get the urge and don't worry about me. Rob will keep me occupied." 

I headed for the front door and he yelled, "Just a god damned minute Minerva. Are you telling me that you are cheating on me with a guy named Rob? Who the fuck is Rob?" 

"He's the guy I took up with when I found out about Alice, Mary, Wendy, Sally (the names Bonnie and Debbie had given me), Doris, Beverly and Charlotte (the girls who worked at Chambers Brothers). At least I only took one instead of a herd." 

"What the fuck does that have to do with anything? I'm a man and all men play on the side. You are my wife and you are supposed to keep yourself for me." 

That statement caught me by surprise and the ridiculousness of it made me laugh. 

"This is no laughing matter Minerva. There is no way I am going to have whore for a wife." 

I was still laughing as I left the house. On the drive to work I thought back over the last twenty-four hours. I met Rob at the motel and we made mad, passionate love. As we were leaving Rob told me that it was our last time. He told me how he felt and that he just couldn't go on. I wasn't prepared for that. Somehow I had thought that he would always be there. 

I spent the rest of the day at work in a funky mood and really wasn't sure why. Then last night I had cheered up some as I fed Brad Rob's leftovers, but when we were done I had trouble sleeping. In the morning I had gone to the gym, but Rob wasn't there. I went through my workout and then had gone home to hear Brad's ridiculous statement that cheating was okay for him because he was a man. The thought of that got me laughing again. 

++++++++++++ 

Work sucked. All I could think about was Minnie and the fact that I would never see her again. The fact that my cell phone went off every ten minutes and the screen showed that the caller was Minnie didn't help things any. 

I managed to get through the morning and just before lunch my secretary stuck her head in the door and told me that my eleven-thirty appointment was in the outer office. I checked my calendar, but didn't see an appointment for that morning. It wouldn't be the first time that something got screwed up so I got up and went to the outer office. Minnie was standing there. I didn't know what to say so I just said,: 

"Good morning. Come on into the office." 

I stood aside to let her walk in and then I followed and closed the door behind me. She turned to face me and said: 

"I was afraid that you might forget our lunch date so I thought I would drop by and we could go together." 

I started to say something, but Minnie held up her hand to stop me. 

"I heard what you said yesterday Rob, but you are my friend and friends need to stick together during rough times. I'm going to need someone to hold my hand while I go through a messy divorce and then maybe comfort me when it is over. Can I count on you to be there for me?" Report_Story
